London, Wednesday, February 25, 1857.
LONDON, WEDNESDAY, FBRBUARY25, 1857.
Last evening, in the House of Lords,
The Earl of DEnyra moved the resolutions respecting the late proceedings at Canton of which he gave notice a few days sinee. He called upon the House to remember they were the highest judicial assembly in the world, and invited them to consider the subject he brought under their notice in a judicial and impartial spirit. They were aware that proceedings of a most violent character had occurred at Canton, which had paralyzed trade and inflicted injury upon the merchants of both nations. The question to be decided was whether the cause justifiedthose events. The first and chief point to be decided was whether the lorcha the Arrow was a British vessel within the meaning of the treaty, and legally entitled to carry the British flag. He contended that she was a China-built ship, captured by pirates, recaptured by the Chinese, sold afterwards by the Chinese, and ultimately bought, owned, and manned by Chinese; and this, he said derisively, was a British merehantman ! It was an essential characteristic of a British merchant ship that she must be wholly owned by British subjects-that was, by natural-born subjects or those that had be-
come such by naturalization. The conditions i nnder which the Colonial Legislature might, in pursuance of the power granted by the Imperial Legislature, pass the ordinance had not been complied with; it had not been approved by any Order in Council, and was therefore worth no more than waste paper. The Arrow therefore was not a British vessel, and, even if a British vessel, no infraction of the treaty had been committed. No one would think of enforcing such an ordinance in the case of the vesseIs of any European country trading on the coast of that country, and it was inconsistent with the righta appertaining to any independent country to absolve these Chine8e from their allegiance, and give them liberty to trade where they pleased under the protection of the British flag. The very existence of the colonial ordinknce had not, although it was an alteration of the existing treaty with the bhinese authorities, been cornmunicated to them until some time after,it ras etablished, and then only upon tb.e eizure af
noble lord thenipro6eeded to contend that, *Iutever doubt there might be as to whether the fiaag waW kying in the Arrow at the time of the seizure of the creaw, there could be no doubt that the Arrow had no legalright to carry thatflag, and in support of that view lie adduoed two statements of Sir J. BOWRIN2G alowing that the license had expired before the reizure. The conduct of Sir J. Bownn;G in admitting that the Arrow could not claim British protection to Consul P&Rnxs, and making a directly contrary statement to Commis3ioner YEE, was not a specimen of that straightforwardness which should always characterize the dealngs of British officials, and it was the more deplorable when it was considered that this country bad been drawn into a destructive and expensive war by such means. Passing on to the claim of British subjects to free admission into the city of Canton, he admitted that the treaty of 1846 conferred that zight; and, although it had been entered into under consider able duresse on the part of the Chinese authorities, he had no doubt that throughout this part.of the transaction our Plenipotentiary had taken a correct view, while the Chinese officers had been altogether in error. The only question that could arise was as to the policy of preming the light at that particular moment. The noble earl read a variety of extracts from the papers to show that in 1848 the Government, upon the authonty of Sir G. Bo ^r, came to the conclusion that it was not expedient to press the claim for admission to Ca-,tnn -n l -
ship, and futirger deiinnstrfit6d by the illustratioh of oertificates of nataralizati6n 'not being iMptd on the continent, thatf even if clothed with the privileges of a Airitish ship, as againsit ourselves, no law, ordinatice, or regisuti -oild give thoso privileges as gazint foreigners. It Wa evident that Sir J. BowpuNG haI actPd throughout upon one fixed idea-viz., his own official-reception into Canton, as immediately after the rupture he lost sight of the case of tle Arrow, and confined himself solely to demandiDg the fulfilment of the terms of the treaty of 18t2. The course of violence, however, which he hAd taken was the least likely to lead to that freeer and snore friendly intercourse 'which it wasghis desire to obtain, and thus, by adopting it, he had defeatWdhix own wishes. He contended it was clear that fromn. the very first moment at which Sir J. BowRnnawas appointed to his present office his great atnbitioa was to procure an entrance; for English traders within the walls of Canton, in spite of the failure of all his predecessors to accomplish that object, and to this was to be attributed all thedeplorabI6 resulta that had ensued. He heartily concurredin the sentiments expressed by his noble friend (Lord DERBY), and would cordially support his motiol. '
The LORD ORANcs:LToR complained that Lord Dznry and Lord LrxDnrussT had both assumed what he denied was the fact,-that the Chinese authorities had given no -occasion for rn,,mAlei
proclamation, issued by Sir momGx in 1849, prohibiting British subjects from entering that city. He argued that the reason assigned by the Chinese authorities for refusing admision had always been the same-a fear of collision between the natives and the English, and that such reason was not a merae pretext, but was shared by Sir G. Boa-NA himself. A new actor, he said, now appeared upon the stage in the person of Sir JOH BOWNISG, who was possessed with a monomania on the subject of br own adnission to, CantonD and who would not consider any sacrifice too great to effect t6at object. While the Chinese authorities were always looling forward to a more favourable season, which never arrived, there were no possible circumstanoes or combination of eireumstanues which, to the mind of Sir J. BOWRINc, did not appear peculiarly favourable to the agitation of this question. Even the failure of the American Minister and of our own Consul to attain a similar object seemed to him to offer the best auguries for his own success. Apartfrom the merits of the question, there was much reason to complain of the manner in which this correspondence had been conducted by the British officials; while the tone of the Chinese was throughout forbearing, courteous, and gentlemanlike, that of ourrepresentativeswas, with hardly an exception, menacing, disrespectful, and arrogant. This condemnation Lord DERBy admitted to be severe, buit he supported it by numerous references to the correspondence. He concurred in the opinion of Commissioner YEn that Sir J. BowRJ-G and Consul P,uRRs had determined beforehand that they would not consent to anything proposed, but would tack to the lorcha grievanee Sir J. BovWnueG's monomania for obtaining admission to the city. He proved by extracts from the reports that the operations were advised and planned by ConaulRPAsRs within 12 daysof the cause of quarrel; that overy overture for peace by the Chinese was evaded, and that at a very early period after hostilities commenced the desire to settle the long Vexed question of access was avowed. When Sir J`EN2f B5OwRmG charged the Chinese with shameful r.olations of treaties, it should not be forgotten that those treaties remained unfulfilled with the full aequiescence of HEE MLArEST's Government, upon *asons assigned and representations made. Want Of courtesy towards the Chinese Commissioner was, therefore, unustifiable. The conduct of Sir J. Bo-V'rU;G ha been governed by one absorbing idea-viz., his own official reception into Cauton, in which the original cause of complaint respecting the Arrow was speedily lost. In an eloquent peroration he addressed a solemn appeal to the bench of Bishops to come forward on this occasion and vindicate the cause of religion, humanity, and eivilization from the outrage which had been inflicted upon it by the British representatives in Canton. He should be disappointed indeed if the right rev. beneh did not respond to this appeal; but in any case he turned with undiminished confidence to the hereditary peers, and called nDon them not to tolerate the.usurpation by authorit sees ' alio of that most ai#ful prerog,ative of the Cuoww, the right of declaring war-not to tolerate upon light and trivial grounds the capture of commereial vessels, the destruction of forts belonging to a friendly country, the bombardment of an undefended city, and the shedding of the blood of unwarlike and innocent people without warrant of law and without moral justification. The noble earl concluded by moving the condemnatory vote of which he had given notice.
The Earl of CLARIMVXoe felt equal confidence with that expressed by Lord DERBY at the close of his speech, that their Lordships would lay aside all party considerations, and see the necessity of upholding the servants of the CRowif when they were inthe right, as in his conscience he believed they were. Lord DERBY had described the relations between Englandand China as having been amicable previous to the late rupture. This, however, was a niisdescription. The Chinese had long sought to violate British rights acquired by treaty, and every resident in Canton, no matter to what nation he belonged, had long felt the present state of things to be intolerable. With regard to the case of the Arrow, a principle was involved In it, and the British authorities in Canton could not have acted otherwise. The ordinance under which the Arrow had hoisted the British flag was not the ordinance to which Lord D])BBy had referred, and it contravened no existing British law. The granting of licenses to ships the property of persons not British-born was not confined to China, but obtained in Malta, Gibraltar, aud Singapore, and there could be no doubt that granting such licenses was perfectly legal. The Arrow had not forfeited her heense, because, although the term had expired, the vessel was stiU at sea, and therefore stil entitled under the terms of the ordinance to bear the British flag. As to the outrage which had been committed by the Chinese, no
- u]fl-Inisrauces,
if Mi. PAK-ES, whose discretion and iuodera-
tion deserved all praise, bad shrunk from demanding redress, he would have failed in his duty, and have given the Chinese reason to believe that theymight proceed to still greater insult. He contrasted the case of the Arrow with that of a French or American vessel arriving bff Liverpool or the Channel Islands under the like circumstances, *and asked what would be thought of British authorities if they had acted as the Chinese had done throughout this transaction. But such an event could not occur among nations who respected international law; and because the Chinese were not guided by considerations of that high character it was necessary to make them sensible of the law of force. He believed that the supposed feeling of the people of Canton against the admission of foreigners was a mere bugbear; but, even were it not, that was no reason why we should not cali upon the authorities to maintain order and* to be responsible for British life and property. He then described the various measures which had been adopted in vain to induce the Chinese authorities to fulfil their treaty engagements and admit British subjects into Canton, and declared that HER MAJESnTs Government would have permitted the question to remain in the position in which it was left by their predecessors, if the affair of the Arro,w had been satisfactorily arranged. At the same time they fully recognized the importance of the entry into Canton, and believed that the QUEEN's officers were justified in taking advantage of the dispute about the Arrow to endeavour to procure a partial fulfilment of the treaty. With regard to the motion, he asserted that the third resolution, as it now stood,.could only be considered by 'HER MAJSTY'S officers throughout the world as a positive prohibition against engaging in offensive operations; and declared that such a prohibition would endanger the lives and property of all British subjects in China, would cast dishonour upon our name and our. flag, and would bring ruin upon our trade with that country.
Lord LYDHmsT had carefully perused the papers upon the table. and had come to the conclusion that the proceedings out ol which this unfortuhate dispute arose could not be *ustHied upon any principles either of law or of reason. As it could not be pretended That the- Chinese were to inform- the British authoritieas before seizing a culprit on board s Ohinese ship, the
xne question waa whether, there being a tre4ty by which the Chinese were bound not to seize suspected criminals on board English ships without the intervention of the British Consuls, the Chinese authoritiea hada right to board the rrow and take away the crew. There was overwhelming evidence to show that the British flag was fying at the timelaud therefore as between us and China this was a Jritish ship. The Chinese might have complained, if they hadf thought fit, that a register had bee uimproperl. granted, but they had no right whatever, accoromngto international law, to board the Arrow, andthus themselves to decide the question of its nationality. There could be no doubt that the Arrow enjoyed a license which it was within the prerogative of the Onowi to grant, and that an outrage had been committed. He himself had not risen to enter into the details of that outrage, but rather with the vieti of impressing upon their Lordships that if an insult was offered to the British flag which the British authorities could not overlook vithout loss of character the evil which might happen ought to be attributed to those who offered the insult, and not to the British authorities, at home or abroad.
Earl Gnxy wished to distinctly assert that the despatch which he had sent to Hongkong in 1847 did not apply to that period alone, but was meant to apply to all time. He could not conceive any doctrine more dangerous than that subordinate officers, who might not be persons of easy temper, might be alloweed to resort to offensive measures without reference to the home Governmnent. The Navigation Laws clearly set forth what were British ships, but those laws in the case of China were modified by the treaty; and it was important to inquire whether the Arrow was a British ship m the fullf intent and meaning of the term. He naintained that the Arrow was not a British vessel in any sense of the term, and sauch, from frst to last, had been the argument of the Chinese. Our policy with regard to China ought to have been one of conciliation. That policy, so long as it was pursued, was crowned with success, and had it been persevered in we might have anticipatea from it the best results. He dwelt on the scandal to Christianity, the suflerings of the innecent Chinese, and the injury to ourselves, which must inevitably follow proceedings which he designated as inhuman. He reproved the Government or adopting the acts of Sir Jonw BoWING, and expressed a hope that one result of the resolution being carried would be his immediate recall. Appealing to their Lordships as Christians, who felt that the precepts of their faith bound hations as well as individuals, he charged them not to become responsible for the blood already ished, but to save themselves by voting for the resolution of Lord DEnry.
The Duke of AitYr vindicated the conduct of the Government.
On the motion of the Earl of CARNARvox, the debate, at 12 o'clock, was adjourned until Thursday next.
In the House of Commons,
Sir-J. WaYLMAnY, in moving. for a select committee to consider and report upon the most practical means for lessening the existinig inequalities in our representative system, and for extending to the unenfranchised a share of political power, urged the necessity for this inquiry, and the reasons why the House should take the subject into consideration. Out of a population of 28,000,000, there being 5,500,000 adult males, only 1,000,000 were electors, and among these coercion and influence exerted, he said, a restrictive effect. Besides the restrictions upon the franchise and the existence of nomination boroughs, there were inequalities inthe system which called for correction. He cited various authorities in support of his views,and insisted that it was due to the people of this country that 4,500,000 adults should not be debarred from the elective franchise.
The motion was seconded by Mr. HEDFrua.
Sir G. STmciCLAXD stated the reasons why he, as a veteran Reformer, could not support this motion. It was the duty of a inember of that House, he said, in moving for a committee to state precisely the objects which the conxiittee should have in view; and it was a mere waste of time to move for a rambling and fishing committee, without a sufficiently specific and defined purpose, which would not promote the object of reform.
After some satirical allusions by Mr. STAJFORD to the embarrassments which such motions caused to the membera and supporters of the Governnient,
Mr. T. DuNCOmE said it was not in his power to support the motion. He could not for the life of him understand what the mover expected from the committee. He was not prepared to insult the 4,500,000 disfranchised by sending their demands and claims to a select committee, like a railway or a cemetery. The question should be discussed in the House in the light of day.
Mr. Fox, in supporting the motion, observed that the very notion of representation included the reform of imperfect representation which was the germ of agitation, the yielding to which was the worst system of policy. Sir J. WV irSE, he observed, had indicated no opinion of his own.
Lord xxnsrTo2 considered the matter of too great importance, and that it involved too many and material interests, to be thrown loose to the chance decision of a committee; it should be placed before the House in the shape of some definite proposition. He thought Sir J. WALmsnEY must see that the concurrence of opinion in the House was against his motion.
After a few remarks by Sir M. BERRLEXY, Mr. L. KixG, and Mr. WABnEBi adverse to the motion, it was, upon a division, negatived by 190 to 73.
Mr. J. FEaousox obtained leave to bring in a Bill to appropriate the income of the first vacant Canonry of the Cathedral Chutch of Carlisle to the augmentation of certain ecclesiastical incumbencies writhin the said city.
Mr. BEXTNCKx moved for a select committee to inquire into the causes of accidents on railways, and into the possibility of removing any such causes by further legislation.
The motion was opposed by Mr. HADFrrLD and Mr. HEnvwonT, and supported by Mr. PALK and Mr. WADDINGTON.
Mr. LowvE said the Government had no objection to the appointment of this committee, which he hoped might devise some means of lessening the number of railway accidents; although he did not believe that this w;asto be sought by legislation.
After some further discussion the motion was agreed to.
Mr. DEASY called, attention to the present mode of conducting the examiinations of candidates for admission into the Civil Service in Ireand, and moved an address to HEB IIAxsry, praying that she would bo pleased to give directions to have such examinations conducted, as in England, by examiners whose charaoter, acquirements, and experience rendered them peculiarly fitted for the duty. He complained not only that the examination was not a real competitive one, but also that it was intrusted to a single person, 'Dr. BAx.
the motion was seconded. by Mr. N" 4n.
The CE B rc of hoExcuEQuzn a he could not accede to the motions 2utthe 0venmentwbre desircau that the examdnMionashould*be hOhio
Ina manner that would give satisfaction, and would
most conduce to the improvement of the public I
service. If it should be found that Dr. BArL was! unequal to the duty, and it was desirable that he shottld have assi3tance, it was open to the Governmnent to make an alteration. He did not think it desirable to establish an independent Board of Commnisioners in Ireland, and a separate system of exaraination there.
Upon a division, the motion was negatived by 44 to 35.
Mr. NAPa called attention to the comMniications with EEB MAJEsTY'S Government respecting the FRANKLIN Expedition, and the urgent nature of the claim for a further and complete search. He referred particularly to the memorial presented by many eminent men of science to Lord PALn3SrTON in June last, and to the possibility that some of the
gaIlant men composing the expedition still lingered mn those lonely regions. The area of search, he observed, was now reduced to limited dimensions4 deg. of latitade and 5 deg. of longitude, where some relics must be found. lie moved for copies of the correspondence with the Government upon the subject.
The motion was seconded by Captain ScOBELL, who urged strongly the necessity and the comparative facility of the undertaking.
Admiral WIVcorT could not lend his assistance to the motion.
Sir C. WOOD declined on the part of the Government to take the responsibility of risking the lives of gallant men in a hopeless enterprise. So long as there was any reasonable hope of saving any of the survivors of the expedition, no risk or expense had deterred the Government, but, after the lapse of 12 years, he believed that there was no hope, and he did not think the Government would be justified in exposing the lives of officers and men in a further expedition. He believed that there was no chance of saving life, and that the possibility of discoverng Journals or records was very remote.
Mr. W. S. L.NDSAY supported the motion, having been informed by experienced persons not only that much was to be gained for science by another expedition, but that there was some hope of saving life.
MIr. 3I. MBS supported the motion, observing that the weight of authority was in favour of another expedition.
Mr. IVRITrBIDE and Mr. Fox spoke in favour of the motion, and Sir ML BEBnisaY and Mr. E DEw-soN against it.
The motion was withdrawn.
Mr. DiLawy moved for copy of any correspondence with the Secretary of State for the Hoara DzPARTN-x, as to the refusal of the bishop of the diocese to consecrate the new cemetery for the borough of Swansea, without provision being made by the burial board for the conveyance to and from the cemetery of the officiating clergyman, stating the particulars of the case.
Air. IAssmV said there was no objection to producing the correspondence. According to the law, the bishop was vested with a discretion in the miatter, with which the Government could not ir,terfere.
After some observations by Mr. blmzs and Mr. Fox, the motion was ag,reed to.
Leave was given to Mr. DuNLop to introduce Bils3 to provide for the registration of long leases in Scotland, and assignations thereof, and to amend the Commissioners of Supply (Scotland) Act, 1856.
'he House having resolved itself into a Conimittee upon Savings-banks,
The C cAsaLLoi of the Excnymrn= moved for leave to introduce a Bill to alter the law respecting tlese banks, which, he iaid, had been long in a mast inconvenient and unsatisfactory state. The object of the Bill was to give to depositors the advantage of Government security, without interfering with local management. He did not propose to alter the rate of interest.
After a short discussion, the motion was agreed io,
the House adjourned at half-past 10 o'clock, until 2 o'clock this day.

' B3STTITIJ E:S AGAINST CHINA.
Lord sAyx aud Swz presnted a petition from Hereford, dep*cating the bombardmeht of Canton, the expedition '**%4r Persia, and the general foreign policy of the Govern. Xnent.
The Earl of DESRBY presented a petitionfrom Manchester, V4r3 nuineroualy signed, expressing an opinion that the acts ci Sir 1L Seymour, done with the coucurrence of Sir John Bowring, were not jutti8Able on the plea of necessity; were innviolation of the loyal Prerogative to declare war; and were worthy of the severest censure.
The Earl of DERBY then rose to move the resolutions of which he had given notice, and said,-My lords, I am now tbou to addrems the highest judicial assembly in the world. I wish I could persuade myself in so doing that every member of this august isembly would approach the considera. tion of the inport&nt question I have to bring before them in a purely judicial spirit ; that they woLld look at it with. Out reference to any couideration but those of equity and jNitioe and of humanity; and that above all they would dis. 2mit from their minds, upon thit occaion at least, every con"idertio conneted In the slightest degree with party ties or political obligationg. My lords, if I can persuade thh Eouse to deal 'with this question in a purely judicial spieit I have suoh confidence in the strength of the case I air abou4l~ to lay before it that I have not the le donlA as to its docision, notwithstanding any inefficiency i the advocate. IUpon this occasion I do appear as am advocate from a conviotion of the justice of my case; but] Am an advocate disinterested, and, most certainly, un paid, I am an advocate in the cause of policy, of jus. tice, and of humanity. (Bear, hear.) I am an advocate for weankesa against Power, for perplexed and bewilderec "arbarism, against the arrogant demands of overweening, self-styled civilizatlon. (Hear, hear.) Iam an advocate foz the feeble defencelessness of China against the overpowerini blight of Great Britain. And, my lords, I am not in thi least degree daunted or deterred by having to bring forwarj the subject before an, English audienrt, neither am ,I at al daunted or deterred by the recolleetion that, to make oul bay ease, I sball have to rely upon statements aud document, exclusively furnished by the very parties whose conduci I am about to impugn. Upon those documents I am eotent to rest my case-upon those documnent3 I ask your lordships to decide. I beg your lord. ships to consider what is the position in whichv w( now find our relations with China. We have carried or with that country for a considerable number of years , vast extent of trade, which has been continually and rapidlj in6redang-a trade of deep importance to this country and of vital importance to those engaged in it. This trade has so increased that the single article of tea has advanced in iC years from 41,000,OOOlb. to 87,000,0001b., and the inerease in the export of sik has been duang the same period to ar enormous extent. Upon the whole, that trade has been carried on under verypeculiar circumstances and under conkiderable difficulties with great success, producing a greal amount of mutual satisfaction, and5very much to the advan tage of the English merchants and the inhabitants of thi .country. Upon a sudden, and without, as it appears to me, any sufficient justification, without any previous warning, that trade with the principal port of China has been Dompletely pu.t an end to, and the most hostile and the bitterest feelings have been engendered between the people of Cantor and the British merchants. Bat not only is the trad( stopped-not only are the goods of our merchants at this moment sequestered to the extent, I believe, of something like 1,50,000dollars-not only are aU commercialopera. tions put a stop to, but at this moment, without any warrant from the Crown, without any declaration, you are in a state of actual war with China (hear, hear), aud that war ii carried on with a degree of aggravation and severity vhicl donot usually accompany civilized warfare. You have had seizares of merchant junks, you have had the capture and destraction of the forts of A friendly Power, you have had a walled, but not a fortified, city battered with cannon, and stormed through what is termed a practicable breach; you have had a whole fleet of war junlrs seized by the superior powver of thig coantry; you have had private residences fired upon by order of a British admiral (hear, hear); you have had a defenceless town bombarded and shelled by British men-of-war. (Hear, hear.) I ask yonr lordships, is this a state of things which yoa can jastify to yourselves, which Parliament can justify tc the country, or which can be passed over in silence withoat demanding eXplanations, if they can be given, from the 'Ministry? and if no sufficient explanation bo given, then I cal upon your lord ships to stamp this state of things witb your htrongest reprobation and to denounce such conduct as unworthy of officials of the British Crown. I will now endeavour to state this as dispassionately as possible, without exaggeration, without colouring; and if, in bringing it before you, I am compelled to make a very considerable trespass upon your lordships' patience, I am quite sure that, so long as I conafine myself strictly to the subject before you, I may with confidence throw myself upon that indulgence for which I have so often had cause to be indebted to your lord. ships. It may be convenient that, in the first instance, I should ¢allyourlOrdships' attention to the particular articles of the treaty the infraction of which has been made the prinary cause of these violent proceedings. Th. treaty ln question is one termed the supplemenW treaty entered into on the 8th of October, 1843, and is supple. mental to the original treaty of 1842, which was somewhat rudely extorted from China at the close of the war. There are two articles in that treaty to which I must ca, paricular attention-the 9th and the 17th. The 9th article runs as follows:-
"If lawless natives of China, having committed crimes or offen¢es aIgainst their owen Government, shall flee to Hongkong, or to the English ships of war, or English merchant ships, for refuge, they shal, if discovered by the English officers, be handed over at once so the Chinese officers for tria, and punshment; orif, before such discovery be made by the English officers, it should be ascertained or suspected by the officers of the Government of China whither sch crimals and offenders have led, a communication' shall be made to the proper Ecglish oineer in order that the said criminals and offenders may be rigidly searched for, seized, and, on proof or admission of their guilt, deliered up. In hlke manner, if any soldier or salor or any other person, whatever his caste or country, who is a subject of the Crown of Eugland, shall, from any causeor on any pzetenceg desert, fly, or escape ino the Chinese territory, such soldier or sailor, or other person, shall be apprehended and confined by the Chinese authorities, and sent to the nearest British Consular or other Government ofier, In neither case shall concealment or refuge be afforded."
Under the terms of this treaty, it folows that any Chinese offenders, being in the colony of gongkong, or on beard a British man-of-war, or on board a British merchant ship, were not to be seized by the Ohinese authorities themselves, but should be demanded from the British Consul, and by him be handed over to the native aulthorities. The 17th article provides for the case of various smnal cutters, schooners, lorchas, &c., belonging to the English nation, and lays down the following rules:-
" 1. Every Britisl schooner, cutter, lorcha, &c., shall have a sailing letter or register in Chinese andEnglish, under the seal and signature of tho Chief Superintendent of Trade, describing her appearance, burden, Ec.
" 2. Every schooner, lorcha, and such vessel shall report berself, as large vessels are required to do, at the Bocca Tigris - and when she carries cargo she shall also report herselifatWhampoa, and sha, on reaching Canton, deliver ups her sailing letter or register to the British Consul who will obtain permission from the Hoppo for her to discharge her cargo, which sne is not to do without such permission under the forfeiture of the penalties laid down in the third clause of the General Riegulations of Trade."
-Now, my lords, having read theae articles of the treaty, I thall proceed to call your attention to statements made by the British Consal to the Chinese Commissioners and to Sir J. Bowring, the substance of which is the same:-
" Canton, Oct. 8, 1856.
"I bhve the honour to inform your Excellency that the British lorcha Arrow, while lying with her colours flying in the river near the Dutch Folly, was suddenly boarded this morning by a force of Chinese officers in a warboat of larg-
ie ana neavy armament, who pinioned and ca-rred - ra9 nearly the whole of her crew, leavingonlyttwo outofT14
men on board, and added to this act of violence the signiii. cant insult of hauling down the national ensign."
Of this the consul complained, and Sir J. Bowring also complained in very emphatic terms, to say the least o them, as a gross outrage and violation of the treaty of 1843. Undoubtedly, if this vessel was strictly and honestly a British vessel, the seizure of two persons on board that vessel guspected of being guilty-as thaey subsequently were proved to have been-of acts of piracy, was a violation of the treaty, hIasmuch as they ought to have been demanded of the Bftsih Consul, and not taken by force, The question is, was mais a vessel which came within the sense of the treaty, or, according to any reasonable or fair construction, vwas she a British vessel ? (Hear, hear.) If she was not a British vessel-if she was not carrying the British flag, and legally carrying it-remember the whole of Your case must fall to the ground. (Hear.) Now, my lords, the circum. stances of the case, as I have presented them to you, are most lamentable, and would be, I aum sore, deeply lamented by the members of Her Majesty's Governmeoit even if they were able to show that in pressing for repara
tion of this injury we had exhausted all means of for. tear-e" and conciliation; that we had carried our indul-
genco of the foiblos -~Aid ejud1ss-4f-tje-cjsi1W_ 'to the very verge of weA -; --Xhat'- we had left them e'very poible IoophbW6'f escape uid Ioliered every p.I ble' -szssg :na o fae from dealing with ts a ii harne tte correspondenceonteoparto teB tho a marked bythe been If, mr!lorsI shal be able to diow that they have accept&l of n:*4pliAlons, t1they havemade their demandswlrh notthng but menace, and returned nothing but intimidatioa to the fimid explanations of the Chinese-if I can sbow that there are many grievous flaws in their demand, and that
ts legality is rore than doubtful-that, in point of fact, in no senSe could this vessel be considered a British merchant. man, and that theoe has been no violation of the treatythen I ask in vhat light will your lordships look upon these occurrences? My lords, at page 134 you will find an explanation put in on the part of the gentleman whose name has been introduced as having been a party to the purchase. That gentleman is Mr. Block, the Danish Consul, sad ac cording to that explanation what was this British merchantmnan ? She was built in China by a Chinese in 1854, sie waienga3ed in the coasting trade of China, captured by pirates, recaptured by the Chinese fleet on. account of the Chinese authorites, and sold to a Chinese Hong in Canton. By thati Hong she as esent over to the colony of Hongkong, and the-n negotiations were entered into for her sale to a Chinese resident of Eongkong. The bargain was nearly concluded when a question arose as to the claim of the former owner. That claim was referred to arbitratration, and the avward of the arbitrator was that the sale from the Canton Hong to. the Chinese resldent of Hongkong would be valid and effectual, but in consideration of the diffliculties thrown in the way of the previous owner proving his title he directed compensation to be made to him of $2,100. Now, my lords, here is a vessel Chinese built, Chinese captured, Chineei sold, Cbinese bought and manned, and Chinese owned, and that is a Britishmerchantman.(Cheers and lang'hter.) Bywhat means was this hip metamorphosed into a British vessel ? In March, 1855, tPelooal Legislature of Hongkong passed an ordinance with a view to remedy the illegal acts which they alUeged.had obtained with regard to the registering of vesels employed solely in trading with the mainland of China. That ordinance enacted, among other thing, that,-
" From and after the passing of this ordinance no ship or vessel whatsoever owned by a British subject shall be at liberty to trade in any of the harbburs of this colony, unless, in the case of an outward trading ship or vessel, she be provided with a certificate of registry in conformity with with th hnperial Acts of Parliament on that behalf; and in the case (of a China trading ship or vessel she has in all respects complied with the requirements of this ordinance," It goes on to say-
"And be it further enacted and ordained that henceforward when any person or persons shall be desirous of ob. taning a register for a ship or vessel in this colony, it shall be neceseary for such person or persons to forward to the Colonial Secretary a declaration in vriting, stating whether the ship or vessel for which such register is soupght is Intended to be employed solely in trade with China, or on meor distant voyages, and that accordins to such statement a register shall be granted to such ship-or vessel, either an Imperial register, as prescribed by the Imi?erial Acts in that behalf, or a colonial register as laid down in this ordinance: provided always that should snch declarations be false, or the ship or vemsel to which it relates not be employed in conformity with it, the register thereby obtained, vhether imperial or colonial, shall ipso facto become null and void."
If that ordinance had reformed the abuses which had prevailed from the improper use of the registers in that trade there could be no doubt that it would have had a most beneficial effect; but on its being referred to the Board of Trade that department took an objection to it which was patent on the face of it, and which would have immediately occurred to any one of your lordships. There is a rule, my lords, that no colonial Begislature can in any case pass laws which are repugnant to the law of England. (Hear, hear.) What did this ordinance do ? Not only was it repugnant to the law of England, but it repealed and annuUed the whole law of England with regard to the qualification of British vessels. (Hear, hear.) I am not nowat this moment going to discuss the substantial merits of this ordinance. I am now dealing with the que3tion of its legality. No such ordinance as this would have been passed, exceptuinder the provWions of the 17thand18th Victoria, cap. 104; but this ordinance was passed in March, 1855, and the Act of the 17th and 18th Victoria did not come into operation until May, 1855; consequently I apprehend that that Act can in no degree have a retrospective effect. (Hear, hear.) I should perhaps here read the opinion of the Attorney-General of Hongkong on this part of the question. He says,-
" The colony of Hongkong, with a Chinese population exceeding at the present time 60,00D, hardly contains 10 Chinese who can legally be called British subjects, for it has not been deemed advisable to naturalize the Chinese here, and the recent settlement of the colony prevents the possibility of theirhavingbeoome subjectsby birth. The great preportion of the respectable part of this population have, however, constituted themselves bon4 Jlde British subjects by becoming Crown tenants of leaseholds for long terms of years (a tenure of which an alien is incapable), and by permanent settlement have evinced the clearest intention of perfecting themselves in the persons of their descendants Briish subjects ecudum leges as weU as defado. I tlerefore, as law adviser to the Crown, deemed it my duty to advise the granting of registers to such Chinese as had, by becoming Crown tenants, so far as in them lay, made them. selves British subjects, and whose discharge of the obligation taken upon them could be guaranteed by other Crown tenants. Bet there had been serious complaints from the naval commander.in.chief and from the consular and Chinese authorities, of the abuse by smalU craft carrying the British flag of the treaty regulations, ana as the prosperity of this colony (so much increased of late) depends entirely, so far as regards the native population, utoon the coasting trade, which is carried on in vessels ranging between 20 and 100 tons, it was deemed advisable by the colonial Government that an ordinance should be passed wlich, in no way interfering with the granting of imperial registers to long seagoing shp should yet facilitate the obtainig of EngLhh papers of a certain description by colonial craft and should also give the colonial Government means which it could not possess under an imperial register of punishing violations of the treatY with China. It was not thougBht necessary to fix the local limits within which the colonal register should mu, because the character of the craft which require those registers and the objects of the local trade render it a matter of the utmost improbability thata colonial reisteredvessel could go anywhere else tban along the coast of China; and as the colonial register is obtained on the strength of a deolaration that the vessel is solely to be employed in trade with China, anda fahsifvinr
of that declaration involves the penalties of the bond whidll accompanies the register, it was hardly deemed necessary to specify any geographical boundaries."
At one time the Attorney-General at Hongkong appears to be justifying one illegal act by another; but I believe what he meaus is this, that inasmuch as no arrangement to hold land by Chinese settlers has been made for a longer period than 99 yeas it was not thought desirable to grant to them letters of naturalization or denization. Now, the essential characteristic of a British merchant ship is that she must be wholly owned by British subjects-that is, by natural born subjects, or subjects who have obtained letters of naturalization or denization and have subsequently taken the oath of allegiance. These are the conditions within vwhich, and within which alone, by British law a vessel can claim the privilege of British ownership and of carrying the British flag. My lords, this enactment has been set aside by the colony of Hongkong, under the supposed sanction-althoasgh looking prospectively for that sanction-of the 547th clause of the hnperial Act, which pointa out not only what the colony may do, but what they maust do, and under what conditions. The noble earl opposite (Earl Grey) referred to this point incidentally the other night, and I will shortly state it to your lordships. That that point does away altogether with all pretence of legality on the part of the colonial ordinance Ithink I shallbe able to show distinctly. What was the condition under which the colonial Legislatbre in 1)aance of the powers granted by the Imperial Leiature passed this Act changing the terms prescribed in this coun try? The condition was to this effect -that the ordinan
should be confirmed by the order of Hler Majestyin Council
that it should be sent out with such confirmation to the colony, and that ou its amval in the colony it should have no force or validity whatever until it had been there proclamed, together withthe Order in OounciL Can .an -.g
be more precise, more strict,moesrnntththi
But what has happened ? No Order in Council has to this day been passed (or the confirmation of the Act in question. (Cheers.) The Secretary of State has taken upon hnself to sgnify his approval of that Act, and has sent it out to the colony. I say, then, that that Act at this moment is waste paper 'Hear hear.) It has not ben confirmed by the Queen in 6ouncil, and of course, therefore, it has not been prolaimed ia the colony suCeeuent to that confirmation. Recollect, my lords~, that all these are questions beaing upon the importankt piint at issue -was ahs legally a Britishvessel? andtif a ritish veei, was there ainfraction of the treat? ear.)

(Hlear, hear.) You will say, perhaps, that these are technicalities. They are not technimlties. (Hear.) They are mnatters of substance and mnatters of imprance. (Hear.) You have dispensed with the checks w ich Parliament thought fit to impose upon the exercise of a most dangerous power by the colonial Legislature and we are here discussing the question as If it were a crIminl indictment aais the Chinese for violating the treaty.

Bet I have not done with this case yet. Suppose the Arow was a British -vessel plying in the watedr of canton. Had she the British flag flying, and, if she had, was it legaly iig no? Now, with regard to the first part of the iAse there is considerable discrepancy. The easter of the vessel, who wt a at the time of the sei et on board another 'vessel in the neighbourhood, declaar that he-saw t'he flag hauled down. The master of the other vesse also makes a similar declaration, and one of the seamen testifies to the sAme thing. On the other band, the Chinese who bearded the Tessel declare over and over again, and in the most solemn mdanner, that they saw no flag, that they hauled down no flag, that they did not believe any flag was flig, knowing the vossael as they did, perfeotly well as a Chinese built and octee vesel navd that they therefore committed no dereliction of their duty in seizing the two pirates on hoard the lorcha.
"tndoubtedll7, if the matter rested here I should be more disposed in uais conflict of authority to take the evidence of the Britisb subjecs, however prejudiced they might be. But Comumdsonere, while he repeats over and over again that no British flag was flying, appeals to thecommon hprac tio existing on thof subject, His anwer a to this practice was never replied to, for the British authorities d we throughout singularly c'hary of argument. He says:-.
" It is an established regulaton with the lorchas of your bonourable nation that when they come to anchor the lower their colourf and donotrehoist them until they again get under way. e thave clear proof that when this lorcha was boarded her colours wee not flying; how, then, could they have been taken dowa?l
To that declaration of the existig practie, I repeat, no answerwhatever isgiven. No, [ th other day,with reference to this point, a reference to a late number of the Fricnd of China of Novemnber 1.3. What says this newspaper? I sorays thatthe evidence of the Chinese had been corrbrated by thenthdepositions (which are not among these ppers), fwarhed veby the consuls, of the master and crew of te Prtugeseloreli, No. 83; anid it adds thiAt
t i y owiotoiopusi hsat Canton that that flag h not been oflin fora six. days previoe s to the tseiure. (Hea, her.) ut,then, it the flag.was flying, was
tf legally flying? Had the master any right to hoist it ? Ares wetoCayp dane bthe principle that in the vat rs of the Cnlese, inatte very doors of Canton, any pirate or mug-
may with impunity hoist the British flag, and that the Chnlese officials snaIl be prevented ascertaining whether or not he has any right to heist it ? It maLy be possble that the mastr of the Arrow had at one time the right to reoist the Brtish flag, but lhe bad no right -to do so at the time of this occurence iand I will farther say that in my belief both the consul and superintendent of trade perfectly well knew that such was the case. (Hear, hear.) I ave omitted, my lor in speaking of the effecta of this ordinance, to

I think that your lordships will agree with me in the assertion that this ordinance was not coimnunieated to the Chinese Government at the time it was passed, although it was in violation of thei treaty which existed betwoen this country and China. At the t-ime of pasing that ordinance the least we could haveD done, when we were materially altering the stipulations ofa%treaty, Or at aul events what we ought to have done before complaining of the violationi of the treaty on the part of the Chinese, was to commnunicate to the Chinese authorities the alteration we had wiade. (Hea, hear.) We dfid no such thing, but LWhat did we do? Not many monLths ago. two lorphas were seizedl carrying license granted to them under this orclirDance. Those lorchas were seized while engage'dt in smugglin salt, and the Chines authorities conftoated thevesels upn wichthe consul a pplied to the Imperial

The first intimation, therefore, of this great change which had been made, And I believe illegally made, andE which directlY affectedi the termas of the treaty, which was communcated to the Chinese authorities was after they had seie vessels which it was only reasonable to suppose, as it was in the present case, were not British but Chinese ships. Now, my lords, I go on as to the legality of this ship carry. Ing the British flg t all.I adrniit that it mayhbea maater of considerable doubt whether or not the flag was flying at the time of the seizure of the crew, but whether the vessel was entitled to carry that flag was a matter 'which admitted of no doubt whatever. The Ilcenses granted Under this ordinaance are for a year, renewable from time to time upon certain conditions. Among other conditions it was provided that the original register should he deposited wit the consul 'withiA seven days of it exiy, and in the event of its not being so depostted tat th license should become null and void. The Act also provides that any infrigement of the provisions of the ordiance shall, undor the colonial registration, be ipeofacto null and void, and shall readerthe vessel sailng under the British flag liable to forfeiture. The ordinance also rovides that the master of any vessel sailing untder the coJfonial regiser, if hophallha to bo at sea at or within seven days of the expirtion o/hei license, shall, on his return to the waters of the colony, dleposit his regiter No, m lods,undubtdlyno penalty would be incrre bya mste ofoneof hes shps ornot depositing hisregste seen ay beoreitsexpratonif he should then hayeot bot sa, ut ndobtel~.theproectonof the sear and 1,,,,,,~,.., - grantefor one

"But, should the Chinese authorities sanction our entrance into the city in April next from fear of the immediate consequences of their refusal, and I myself be permited to visit the Impefial Commissioner at hlis residence, we should have no security that in less than a week after some Britsh subjects wouldnot be insulted and beaten, and perhaps, in the mWlIe murdered. I have myself come to tie conclusion that the authorities are by no means desirous that we should be Idmitted; but I am also impressed with the opmion that, even if they were disposed to concede this, they have not the lpower of compelling the 0ple to behave themselves in a qmuet and peaceable manner. the result of our insisting on entrance under such circum. stances into a city said to contain nearly 1,000,000 of people is tolerably obvious; unless, indeed, we keep a force ready at hand to take satisfaction for the very first insult or act of violence that may take place."
Inanswer to that despatch is one from lord 'Palmerston, dated Oct. 7, 1848, which I think reflects great credit on the good sense and juagment of that noblelord. He says-
" It has always appeared to me to be doubtful -wbether the right of entering the city of Canton would be productlve of any material advantage to British residents; while it hag been inlain that the unrestricted entrance of British residents into that city might lead to disputes and collisions between British subjects and Chinese, the consequences of which might be serious I should wish, however, to know what practira disadvantage in regard to commerce the British rcsidents at Canton now sustain by not being allowed to e.nter tJ.e city, and what practical advantages, beyond those of pleasure and amusement, British subjects would derive from the power of entering the city when they chose."
Again, Lord Palmerston says, in a despatch dated Dec. 30-
" I am clearly of opinion that it would not be advisable to proceed to hostile measures against Canton, or to take the unusul step of a misson to Pekin, in regard to a privilege which, like the admission of Britih subjects into the city of Canton, we have indeed a right to demand, but which we could scarcely enjoy with security or advantage if we were tosueceed-in enforcing it by arms. It may be true that the Chinese might be encouraged by their success in evading compliance with their engagements in this matter, to attempt to violate other engagements; but this consideration does not seem to me to be sufficient to determine Her Jijesty's Government to put the iaue of peace and war upon this particular point. We should not find it more dificult to employ coercion in order to enforce a more really useful and valuable right than in order to obtain the practical acknowledgment o. this zight of very doubtful value; but a gat naval and military effort made to enforceo a valuable right would be well warranted by the value of the advantage to be ained, while such an effort for a right which would be o little use or benefit when obtained would not stand upon equallyjustifiable ground.-"
Then Mr. Bonham, in answer to Lord Palmerston's in quiry, xays this-and remember that this is the language of a man who ad the greatst possible experience of China who knew the Chinese character perfectly well, and who bad been for a considerable time employed in Her 31ajesty'a service. Mr. Bonham Says-
" It is my bel:ef that no material advantage to our commerce would be gained by British subjects being admitted indiscriminstely mto Canton; at all events, none commen. surate with the danger to be risked of invol nzthe British Government in hostile discussion with that of ina; for I am sati8fied that, with the present temper and feelfng of the populace in rezard to this change, not one month would pass without some gross act of insult or violence being cornmitted agDainst any British subjects rwho might avail themselves of the privilegeo; such in all probability, ending i bloodshed, and renderlng it iecescary for us to take step which wFould certainly tend very much to embarrass our

" I have now to state to you, in reply to these despatchef,f that although it would no doubt simplify matters if Rer Majestys Gxovernmnent were to renounce entirely and for ever the right awcordedlbytmty to British subjects to enter Canton; and, although it would possibly, on the other hand, place our futureA relations ltith China upon a more certain and satisfactory footing if we were by force of arms to compel the Chinese Government to fulfil tA hnAWA',nA t 1d,JA9
mere can be little doubt that they coulnddoftheych-o; yet, all this considered, Her Majety's Governmeflt are not disposed otakeeitherofthesecotures. Arenunciation of the treaty right would be inexpedient, because, though the exercise of tne right may not for the present be attainable without efforts which would be disproportionate to the object, or without risks in the enjoyment of it which would counterbalance its value, yet at a future time, the state of things may be different, and the privilege may be wllingly granted and safely enjoyed. An enforcement of the treaty right by miitary and navaloperations would require an expensive effort, might lead to loso of valuable lives on our part, and much loss of life and destruction of property to be inflicted on theChinese, while the chief advantage which it seeing, by your account, we should derive from a asucessful result would be that, by giving such an example of our determination and poWer to enforce a faithful observance of the treaty, we sb6uld deter the Chinese from cttem,ptin future and. other 'Violations of that treaty. Bnt fer l£ajestys Government are not disposed for this object to mnake the' effort orto produoe the conseqnsueso abovemnentioned.- and they prefer waiting to deal with future violations of tie treaty according to the circumstances of the case, If such violations should oeeur"* (Hear, hear.) Thus, my lords, uponi the authority of Mr. Bo'hLm, in 848-4r, Bonhm b ,eing a man thoroughly versed in Chinese affairs-Lord Palmerston and the G<. verment of that day camne to the conolusion that it was not e0edeut to pres this question ; an,V.eqety in 1849, hirjBonham issued a proclamationprohibitingBritish subjicte from attempting to enter the city of Canton, and the claim washeld inzbeyanoe,to be urgeL or not, accordint as policy might dictate, at some future period. I shqit
here say that thp ground uron which the Chinese authori. ties have obijcd to the introdnction of British subject3 bas always been the same--vz., a fear of evil consequences arising from conflict and collision, a dread of their inabilitj. to protect British subjects from the hostility of the natives, and a sense of the dange of distulisug the good. mndet. standing which suba ebetweeni the two coumtries. fy lords, we havo, a very culrious Mllustrxtion of the sincerity of thatplea in theprvate letters of Kejing, the Chinese Commisi oner, to Bc,,xinting out the embarrusment in which he was pl by the mere approach of the dii. cuson on the questlon of the admison to Canton, and enumnerating the deplorable consequences which would result from his complianc, with the request of the British. And, my lords, let us bea" m rind that we are very imrrfectly acquainted with the nternal argements
cncontttof tChina. (Hlear, bear.) We are imperfectly acquaiyted with the lwaw which regulate the sbcial intercourse of the Chinese with each other, and we knot nothing of the distribution of power among the different branches of the State. We look upon China as a despotisnS iu d, m a1 probbility, the Emperor of China is a purel; despotic monarch. But#that despotism, from long habit and custom is conxtroUed and regulated by certain maximrs aid principles which are broadly laid down in all the Chinsee papers that have come before us (Hear, hear.) We ,aaie been accustomed, my lords, In this oountry to hear a mbrxi4 very frequently quoted which sounds very well, although I cannot say.that on all occasions it is quite a correct maxiw. Our Liberals, howeover, would certainl not complain of the marim, oox,,optuli vonc Dei. Let usread that maximu trans. Sated into Chinese. Here 4s what Yeh wrtes to Sir Mliehael
"It is said in the book of history, 'Heaven ees as my people see- Heaven hears as my people hear,' that is to say, that wQat the people are averse to Heaven (the Deity) Is averse to. Is not ths an additional reason why I should be unable to constrainl (the people)'. I must add that, as it is
te habit of your Exceilenc,s nation to adore theS~pirit of Hieaven, it behovee you, in my opinion, sO much the more toacvonfo,rm in your actions to the principle given us by
(A laugh.) On another occasion Yeh writes:
"' The people are looked on by the State as its foundation. When the ruler' loves his_ieople there is some prospect of their obeying their ruler.Th us, as a general rule, has it ever been. To run counter to the fee of man is to disegard what nature teaches is right before Heaven. This has never been the policy of China, and I assume that your Excelencys Government no less recognizes the paramount obigdation of conforming to hat iES right before Heaven
We have a higher authority still, that of the Emperor hiraself, -who says.-
" In the protection of the people lies the security of the State. Whea the ple of wagtung are unanimously determined aginst the a on of foreignersinto the city, can an Impera inrunetion be lid ot thema by proclation so to do, whether they win 0mb? It is not m the piower of the Government of China to cross the wishes of the people out of deference to those of the men from afar; on
ae other bnd, t behovea foreig nations to study he temper of thepop e t he ca of their merchants may work free from rik."
I have read, these maxims, my lords, not as Altogether ooncurrmn; in them, but for the purpose of showing to your lordships that there is a power In China recognized and establis ed above the despotic power of the Crown, and that the Throne in China is not free from the control of public opinion; and for the purpose, further, of showing that the plea of danger to the tranquillity of the country and to the persons of the Englishreddents from admission into Canton is not a mere pretext, but a bond Jfde opinion, honestlyand truly entertained, not only by the Chinese officers, but by Mr. J~onham h'xsl. ( ear; hear.) I have now, my lords, traced=hese proceedings up to 1849, and at my request the noble earl opposite has been good enough to lay on she table rome further correspondence relative to the entrance into Canton; *ad here we fnd anew actor uponthe stage. Mr.
Bouam was on leave of absence, and his place was oocupied by Dr. Bowrinag The doctor had been the consul, but in
thse absence of Mfr. Bonham he was actng as Saperintendent I of Trade. I do not wrishto say anything disrespectful of Dr. Bowring HIe ma;g be a man of great attainments; but it appears to me thavt on t3ejc fattso Int CAnton e ors this !subject of admisson into nton he n xossed with a perfect monomania. ("Hear, hear," and a laugh.) I believe he dreamns of the entrance into Canton. I believe he thinks of it the first thing in the morning, the last thing M. night, and in the middlel of the night if he happen to be awake. (A laugh.) I do not believe that he would condder any sacrifice too eat, any interruption to commerce to be
deplored, any rl=0dshe almost to be regretted, hen put I in the scae with the immense advantage to be derived from the fact that Sir John Bowring had obtained an official reception in the Yamun in Caton. (Luchter.) I believe the noble earl the President of the Councifhas ;trae insight into the character of Dr. Bo rmng for durin the short time he held the seas of the Foreignoffice he pve the followinglinstructions to that eminent publc servant -
TIt will, of course, be your duty carefully to watch over and to insist upon, the performance by the Chinese authorities of the engageneuts which exist between the two eountries. But youwill not push argument on doubtful points in a manner to fetter the free acton of your Government; and you wil not resort to measures of fore without previous reference home, except in the extreme case of sach measures being required to repel aggression or to protect the lives and properties of British subjects."
(Hear, hear.) In his answer to that despatch Dr. Bowring says that he shall, of course, defer to his lordship's instruio tions; he then enters into arnargunmentof two pages to show that he had better not defer to those instrutions, and he finishes by giving this ominous announcement-

Which is a precisely analogous emm to that of 18o56
In 1815 Sir T. Davis represented that a grox, outrage had been committed on some British emen. who had been decoyed into the suburbs of Canton. A fewmonths later he reported that a nurder had been popetrted, and at the saine time stated thait he had requiestedi General D'Agtilar to come to Canton in order to co-ooratewitl a naval force. General D'Agillr arrived at (anton. on the 1st of April, and oi the 3d he reported that he ha& seized the forts on the river, blown in the gates of the city, de8troyed the magazines, and spiked a large ntunber eL guns. The result was that Sir J. Davis immediately obtained an interview with Keying, after which he senb him a written list of his demands, including that of admission to Canton. It was in consequence of thee military operations that Keying consented to name' a day on which the treaty should be fulfilled. At the same time a proclamation was issued calling upon theChinese not to molest foreigners; on the contrary, under pain of heavy punishment always to treat them wel-which, 1S a clear proof that whenever the authorities are afraWi. themselves they can fiud means to keep the people in order. The case of 185f was precisely analogous. In both there was; an infraction of a treaty; in both oommo nication was refused; in both further forbearance .was considered to be impolitic; but last year more moderation was displayed thanr in 184f7. Allthat was then asked was the restoration of the men according to the treaty, and an apology for. the insultto the ag. But the operations of Sir J. Davis and General D'Aguilar were approved by Lord Palmerston. In, his first despatch to Sir J. Davis the noble lord maid:-
"Foreign-office, Jnue 24, 1847.
Sir,-I receied esterdayattenoon the duplicate of your despatch of the 1zth of April, purportin" to give a morodetailed account of the oprations against banton, undertaken in the beginnsig of that month, than was containedin, your previous despatches of the 5th and 6th of April, and I received at the same time your separate despatch of the 16th of April, enclosing a copy of Major General D'Aauiljrs re-
r to the Secretary of State for the War Aepysnent. ut I have not yet receivedyour despatchesofthe Athand6th of ApriL Althougb, in consequence of the non-arrivl of theprevnous despatches, Her Majesty's Goverument have not the means of forming a correctjudgment of thegrounds on which. the expedition was undertaken against Canton, or as to thenegotiatons which preceded that expedition, yet enough. agPPears from the despatches which they have received from you, and from the articles of a%reement concluded with.
eying, to show that the expedition was undertaken to. obtai redress which had been refused on the several matters mentioned in that agreement, and I have accordingly great satisfaction in stating to you that Her Majestt - vernnent, as at present informed, are of opinion that you were fully justified in having resolved to undertake the expedition, and entirely approve the promptitude and judgment with which the arTragements for it were made, the deeision and enterprise with which it was conducted, and. the ability and firmness with which you seem to have compelled Keying to accede to all your demands.
I am, &c., "' PALESTON."
That was the first despatch of Lord Palaerston. There was. another after be had received the despatches, but as it is alnost a repetition of the former I will not trouble your lordships by reading it. Lord Palmerston was then the colleague of my noble friend now sitting at the table (Earl Grey). My noble friend expressed no disapproval of those
operations - on the contrary, I believe his approbation has - been recorded in Warm terms. (Lord Grey made a guiesture of dissent.) My noble friend shakes his head. I have perused the despatch of my noble friend, and if he wi i r- suit meIwill readit toyourlordships. Ihesitatetodo so because I was not until recently aware of the existence of this despatch, and coneequently it does not appear in.the papers which have been laid upon your lordshipaZ table. It was on that account that I merely alluded to it as expressing the approvalof my noble friend. If, however, my noble friendnas no obiection I will read it to the Hous. On the same day on wich Lord Palmerston vwrote to Sir John D,avs my noble friend (Earl Grey) wrote thus to General.
"Downing-street, June 24, 1847.
"Sir.-I have receivedI and laid before the Quteen your despatch, dated Hongkong, 15th of April last, reporting the operations in which the troops under your command, conjontly with Her Maiesty's naval forces under the command of Captain M`Dolgall, of Her Majesty's steam-frigate Vulture, have been engaged in the Canton river, and I have it in cormnand to acquaint you that it has afforded much oatisfacton to Her Muajesty to receive your report of those operahons, crowned as they have been with such complete success-a result which Her Majesty attributes not less to the judgmnent with which those operations were plannecd than to the Admirable disciPline of H[er Majesty's miitary and niaval forces under the orders of yourself and of Captain M'Dougall.
"I have, c., "G GPM. "Major-General D'Aguilar, C.B."
That is clearly an approval of the manner in which the - operations were conducted, and the despatch certainly conveys no disapprobation of anything which had taken place. I said that less moderation was shown in that year than in 1856. The reason of that was the extreme smallness of the force which General D'Aguilar was able to employ. When called upon by Sir John Davis, he said that he should feel confident of success if he were allowed to set about the business immediately and give to it the character of a coup de main. He embarked his troo s the same evening and the consequence waa that in 36 tours he was completely successful, he had done all that was desired, and the negotiations had been concluded. But he felt that if the Chinese authorities required to be chastised again it would not be safe for him to venture upon a renewed attack with a force so small as that which he had at his disposal. Hle accordingly wrote to the commander at Ceylon to ask for the loaa of a very small force for a short time. This brings me to the letter of my noble friend lEarl Grey), to which the noble earl opposite has alluded. When my noble friend moved for the production of that letter I did not not know what were its contents, and I must say that I understood him to give a description of its contents which was not qcuito accurate. I understood that it was a general prohibition addresaed to the authorities in China against under. taking any operations whatever without instructions from home. [Earl Grey.-"Offensive operations."j And my noble friend added that he.had the Duke of Wellington's approval of that prohibition. (" Hear, hear," from Earl Grey.) I was very much astonished that the Duke of Wellington should have approved of orders being sent to officers at the other extremity of the world, with sufficient forces under thleir command, that, whatever might occur, whatever outrage might be offered to life or propert, they were tamely to stand by and look on until they received instructions from home. (Hear, hear.) My astonishment at this was very great, but it altogether ceased when I looked at my nob fend's letter sLnd the despatches upon which it was founded. I then found that, so far from being the general instruction, it was only a wise, prudent, and neces-
Eary order, because it was quite clear that no force which. could have been sent from Ceylon could have placed General D'Aguilar in a position to undertake any further operations against the Chinese with any chance of a success. ful issue. My noble friend limits his prohibition to " further operations against the Chinese," evidently alluding to the operations which had just been concluded, and to continue %hich General D'Aguilar had asked for a force which my noble friend rightly considered would be wholly insufdicient for the purpose. On looking at the papers I also find that there was another reason which made my noble friend's order so prudent, and that was the defenceless condition in which the island of Ceylon would. have been left if this request had been acceded to. When I read the piteous letter of the officer commanding there, in which he describes the internal dangers to which the colony might have been exposed by the temporary loan of these 10men, I no longer wondered at the great haste with which my noble friend sent out his prohibitory despatch. I must apologize to your lordships for having detained your lordships so long. (Hear, hear.) I will only add that the third resolution of Imy noble friend, as it now stands, can only and will only be considered by Her Majesty's offices in China, and more generally throughout the world, as a positive prohibition to engage in any offensive operations without instructions from home. (Hlear, hear. ) If it be so considered, I can conceive nothing more calculated, or rather more certain, to cast dismay into the hearts of every British resident, not only at Canton, but in any part of China. If it be established here and become known in China that we abandon this system upon which we have been absolutely comupelled to act; that when our rights are violated or injuries are inflicted upon us our demands for reparation are not to be supported by force-if itbe once understood that any insult or wrong may bein'dicted upon us, and that four or five months must elapse before it can be avenged, the position of every British resident in China will be one not only of the deepest degradation, but of the utmost danger ; and certain I am that every Brtish resident who does not quit China will be compelled for the safety of his life and of his property to renounce his nationality, to abjure the British aflag, and to seek protection from the French or some other foreign Power. (Hlear, hear.) If such a general order as this he enforced, what chance will your plenipotentiary and constas have of obtaining redress
forthe.violution of treZaty rights, not merely from the ImperW oe,otromtemnais ftel'~s
class? The Chinese authorities WMil laugh in their faces
and toU them to wait untilinstructions come from. England. Then, in the aggravated state Of circumstances which you will have done much to produce outrages may be cosnitted such as that recorded in the aper laid upon your lordships' table on Friday last, in wbich a poor French missionarywar tortured for three dayf, then hung, and his heart eatenby hios executioners-some such case as that may occur which will
rouse you to action, and you will send instructions to Tour representatives to ask for redress, and if it be not granted to pro-
ceed to hostilities. But under what altered circumstances.- ,will those hostilities be commenced The force which at the commencement of the difficulty might have been ample may then be quite insufficient, You will have given the Chinese four months to collect their forces, to arm their forts, to preparo their fleets, and to barricade their rivers ; and you may then find it useless to ask for redress, becausethe Queen's admiral says that forces which would have beensufficient four months before are now quite unequal to the task imposed upon them. If this instruction is not to be general the exceptions ought to be soecified, and I defy any Dno to make out a schedule which shalU include all cases in whh the rule ought to be departed fro. Therefore I
trust that your lordships Will not agreehto a reaiutionwhickwvll fetter the discretion and tie the hands of Her Majesty's Eervant5 in Clina, which will cast disgrsco upon our namemdorflaand will bring ruin upon our trade -with that
Lord LYIDHIURST.-I have paid great attention to. the papers that have been Laid upon your lordships' table, %nd I am sorry to say that I have come to the. painf conclusion that the proceedings out of which thisi unfortunate dispute hm arisen cannot be justifledpon any principles either of law or of reason. (Hear, hear.) Afterthe full, comprehensive, and conclusive rguments which have been addressed to your lordships by my noble friend the Earl of Derby, and nopart of Whiph has beenanawered by
.,paoly for ths ijury, and, by retaining the men you have
2seiz in your eustdy, you signiy your approval of this -rilationof the treaty, an`cleave Her Jiajesty's Government -without any assurance th.t similar aggressions shall not again occur."
'What, my Lord5 are the facts of the case? They are these -that the Chinese officials, declaring all the way through that this was not a British vessel, and consequently that they had not violated any treaty engagement-that they had gone on board a Chinese vessel and seized Chinese piratesnevertheless returned nine of the men against whom there -was no charge on the foUowing day, and in the course of .another day or two, on the urgent demands of the British authorities, the whole of the 12 men were returned to the -consul, who refused to receive them, not because they had not all been sent back, but because he thought fit to say the proper Chinese officer had not been sent to accompany lhem. Even to that the Chinese Commissioner made reply that he had sent the officer who usually dealt with foreigners, and stated his rank and position, but, to use his own words, " strange 'o say, he did not get any acknowledgment." The men having be3n sent back, and assurance given "t hat hereafter, if any lawless characters should be concealed on board foreign lorchas, you, the said consul, shall of course be informed of the same by the Imperial Commissioner, in order to act in conjunction with the Chinese authorities." Mr. Consul Parkes, writing to Sir Michael Seymour, said:-
" As to the surrender of the men, his Excellency offered -early this morning to give up 10 of them, but 12 having been seized I declined to receive a smaller number. He 'then forwarded the 12, but n ot in the manner required in mny letter of the 8th, and demanded that I should at once return two of them without any ' proper officer' being deputed to conduct with me the necessary examination. I again declined to receive them on these conditions, or in any other manner than that described in my letter of the 8th, and the men were again taken away. Finally, no apo. Iogy of any kind has been tendered."
Undoubtedly, my lords, the Chinese Conimissioner had not offered any apology for an act which he contended was strictly within the letter of his duty, but he had sent back the whole of the men, onl requiring that two, against whom piracy could be established, should be returned by the consul, and I must say there appears to me to be contsiderable force in the statement which the Commissionersubsequently made:-
" But Consul Parkes had made up his mind not to consent to wbat was proposed."
(Hear, hear.) I very much agree with the Chinese Commissioner that Cnsul Parkes and SirJ. Bowring had both de. termined to make the most they could of such a grievance, for the purpose of tacking to it the monomania of Sir J. Bowring as to free admission into the city. (Hear, hear.) The two subjects may appear dissimilar, but I wiUl show your lordahipathat in the mind of Sir J.Bowvring they were connected together. On the 20th Mtr. Consul Parkes attends at Hongkong, where there is a conference, and Air. Consul P'arkes then lays down very broadUy and very distinctly the whole plan of the campaign as it was to be conducted in case of the continued refusal of the Chinese Governmnent;and here is that plan:-
"I advise, therefore, and I do so with all the deference due to the superior judgment of your Excellency and the Mnval commander-in-chief, and with a deep sense of the resonsibility which I, as the officer charged with the care of British interests at Canton, in offering this advice incur, that, as we have searched the river andfound no war junks (and anything less than the seizure of a fleet would, I am now convinced, have had no effect on the Imperial Commissioner), our operations should now be directed against the forts between Whampoa and Canton. The Imperial Comnnmssioner, I submit, should again be summoned to grant the satisfaction already demanded within 24 hours, failing which we should then take possession of the four Barrier Forts. I cannot conceive it possible that his Excellency wil then withhold compliance with our demands; but, should he still eontinue contumacious, a similar course should then be puirsued with the forts at Canton, and it would be exceedingly advisable, I think, that the residence of his Excellency, which is not far from the water-side, should also in that case feel the effects of the bombardment." (Hear, hear.) Now, listen J-
" I advocate attack om the Barrier Forts in the first instance, because they stand by themselves, and are not surxounded, as are those at Canton, by the dwellings of the people."
In the first instance he recommends the destruction of the Barrier Forts, but in the next of the town forts. Althou_h he knows the latter are surrounded by the dweiings of the people, he coolly and deliberately advises that those forts should be attacked and captured, and, if that should fail to produce any effect, that the next step should be to bombard the private residence of the Commissioner himself. (Cheers
We find the plan of operations laid down by Mr. Consul i'arkes as early as the 20th of October-only 12 days after the first cause of quarreL (Hear, hear.) I said I could connect these two apparently very various subjects, the seizure of the 12 men and the entrance of foreigners itnto the city. As early as the 15th of October Sir John Bowring says, "I await the development of events "-I beg your lordships to observe that expression-" I await the development of events, in order to decide on our fature mode of proceeding."' The campaign proceeds according to the plan laid down by Mr. Consul Parkes. The Barrier Forts are taken without casualties, and the towzn forts without resistance. The Barrier Forts are taken on the 24th, and on that day Sir John Bowring writes
" have conveyed to Sir Michael Seymour auq opinion that if his lccelleney and yourself agree on the fitness or the opportunity, it would be well if the rexala qu=cstio oi our entrance into the city should now be settled."
As soon as he has picked a quarrel, nominaUy about thE affair of the lorcha, he takes advantage of the quarrel, a, he vwished to take advantage of peace and tranquillity. (A 3augh. )
" It -would be well if the,czala qwshio of our entrancE into the city should now be settled, at least as far as tk secure us an official reception there. This would be a crowning result to the succefal operatio f Er Maj"t '
Uinder the same date he writes to Sir M Seymour:-
".If your ExceUency and the consul should concur with mae in opinion that the circumstances are auspicious for re. q,niring the ful61lment of treaty obligations as regards the ctty of Canton, and for arranging an offlcial meeting with
the Impenial Commission within the city walls, I shall wil. lingly come to Canton for that purpose." 'The consul wfrites on the same date:
"TeiPerial Comnmissioner still withholds notice os apology, and noopportunitv, therefore, has yet been afforded frarahing bY peaceable argument the rxclck quois(i to ME chyottr gExcellency's despatch refers.",
On the 25th, the foUowing day, the Commissioner has sent an answer, and that gives the consul ani opportunity of
'initiating," as Sir J. Bo-ring says, the ceta qst<e8stio:_
" A reply was sent this monn hogniL Out to tJ'
Imperial Commissioner that fre o ntror with the authorities was necessary to prevent a recurrence of these
On the 27th Sir J. Bowring, in answer to Ir. Consul 'Parkes, says: -
"I have every confidence in your maaking the develop3ment of evenxts instrumental in placing all our future relationas on a better fouxndation, "and quite approved the mnanner in which you have initiated the discussion of the city guestion, the settlement of which is nerhaps even miore desirahle for tle Chinese authorities than for ourselves."
B3ut, aisle diplomatist as Sir J. Bowring was, andi ably seconded as hie was by the consul, he found himiself detected in the delicate initiation of the question of entrance into 'the city. Commissioner Yeh says :
"'But I, the Mfinister, also know full well what you, the said consul, have in. view. (A laugh.) For a cortainty, it is nOthing less thani a desire On your part to imitate the coure tkenby te EvoyDavi inthesPring of 1847."

"Earl Grey to Major-Goneral D'Aguilar

"Sir, -The Governor of Ceylon has commnunicated to me an applcation which yen have made to the Major-General commanding Her Majesty's troops in that island, for a reinforcement of half a company of artillery, with two guns and a proportionate supply of ammu,niWon, to he held in readineas to be forwarded to Htongkong, should circumstances render it necessary to undertake an ^ further military operations at Canton.

ti mhe Carttn i-ver were attended -ith llllthiate-uccess,
the risk of a second attempt of the same kind would far overbalance any advantage to be derived from such a step. If the conduct of the Chinese aLthorities should, iufortisnately, render another appeal to arms inevitable, it will be necessary that it should be made after due preparation, and with the employmont of such an amount of force as may afford just grounds for expecting that the objects 'which ry be proposed by such a measure will be effectually accomplished 'without annecessary lcss.
" I have, &c., GnY."
A wiser and more statesmanlike letter could never be written, but it is imnossible to read it without being convinced how directly Sir J. Bowring has acted contrary to his own instructions and to the spirit of that letter. Without previous instructions from the Government he has commenced hostile operations, he has sent for troops, he has had themn furnished to him in such miserable ntumbers as greatly to enhance the risk and danger attending those operations, and consequently incurring the risk of affording a triumph to the Chinese by our failure. Icstructions of a sirilar character were given in 1c553 by the Duke of New-
castle. Now, my lords, Ian really ashamed of trespassing so much upon your patience. (lear, hear.) I have omitted many matters which I could have laid before you, and I will now only recall to your recollection the succession of operations which afterwards occurred. I would, however, wish you to retaarkthisfact-thatfrom the moment the question of the official reception of Sir J. Bowring within Canton was brought forward the case of the lorcha and the insult to our flag was totaUy forgotten and unnoticed (hear, hear); and it is still more surprising that in a letter from the admiral that point was insisted upon as a sine qud rnon, which, if not yielded, would render necessary more extensive operations. It is singular that at the very time the admiral was assuring the Chinese authorities that his demands vere unconnected with any previous demands Sir J. Bowring, with equal perseverance and confidence, thought those demands wereonly the legal and necessary consequence of previous demands never abandoned, and which were now positively insisted upon. From one part of this disastrous
sto weproceedto another. From the destruction of the Junks, the capture of the forts, the storming of a city without defence beyond an unfortified wall, we come to the throwing shot andshellUinto the eommissioner'sresidence, the capture and destruction of the whole of the Imperial fleet o, unks, effected with a loss of one man killed and 4 'wounded. In all these miserable proceedings we find the same thing- forts mountimg 200 guns destroyed, another mounting 210 guns destroyed-a hot fire kept up for an hour, and the total loss is 1 killed and 4 wounded. Some of these exploits were achieved without any loss, and thus it is that Her Majesty's naval forces have been prosecuting these inglorious operations (hear, hear)- and yet 'we have Sir J. Bowning writing to the admiraI most fulsome and disguting letters, congratulating him upon the brilliant achievement and the glorious, successes upon the union of military skill and sagacity he had displayed, the unparalleled valour of the forces, and other fulsome phrases applying to operations in which so little resistance had been offered-the destruction of undefended forts and the capture of unfought ships. There is one passage in this book to which I must advert for a moment. This is the way Sir J. Bowring, immediately after the capture of the city, speaks of that lamentable event. One would have thought that the chief superintendent would at least have expressed regret at the necessary bloodshed,
hich, although small, had accompanied the event. Not so. It appeared that so prevalent in his mind was one idea, that every calamity, however grievous, vwas regarded from af single point of view,-as to how it affected his reception into Canton.
"Since 'writing the above I have received your despatch, dated yesterday, containing the gratifying inteligence that the city had been entered by Her Majesty's marine forces, the yamun of the Imperial Commissioner visited by the admiral and yourself, and our great object of hostile action thus satisfactorily accomplished. I feel every confidence in the continued exerciee of those admirable qualities, mingled sagacity and valour, 'which have been hitherto so remarkably displayed."
The last scene 'which closes this history, as far as we are acquainted with it, is that on the 15th of December. Sir M. Seymour writes :-" I am now shelling the city from the Dutch Folly Fort." (Hear, hear,) There is the conclasion of these negotiations entered upon with so much zeal by Sir J. Bowring, the favourable opportunity taken by him for the attainment of his favourite object, the result being that he is really further than ever from it. As has been pointed out to him, he has taken the strangest of all possible modes for inducing a commercial, but at the same time suspicious and jealous people, to admit foreigners to a freer intercourse, by battering down their houses, bombarding their city, and rendering them fatherless, childless, and houseless. Thus, in a time of profound peace, without any declaration of war, we have this capture of junks, destruction of forts, cannonading of the governor's house, shellinz of an inoffensive commercial city, and then we find we are further off than ever from the attainment of the object to gain which we performed these feats. I gladly spare your lordships many painful details connected -with this history ; but there is one matter which I must call to your notice. It is a representation from the inhabitants of Canton after they had been exposed to all these attacks. Recolleet what thesepeople had suffered and were suffering at that moment, and contrast the patient language and submissive resignation of this memorial with the arrogant and overbearing tone of tho aespatches of the British representative -
" Your nation has traded at Canton for more than a century, during which it may be said that between you and ourselves, the Cantonese, there have been relations of friend. ship, and not of hostility The late affair of the lorcha was a trifle; it was no case for deep-seated animosity, as areat offence that could not be forgotten; yet you have suddenly taken up arms, and for several days you have been firing shell, until you have burned dwellings and destroyed people in untold numbers. It cannot be either told how many oldpeope, infants andfemales, haveleft their homes in afiction. your countrymen have not seen this, they have surely heard, have they not, that such is the case? What offence has been committed by the people of Canton that such a calamity should befall thema I Again, it has come to our knowledge that you are insisting on official receptions within the city. This is dotthtlms with a view to amicable relations, but, 'when your only proceeding is to
open a fire upon us which destroys the people, suppoing t at you were to obtain admission into the city, still the sons, brothers, and kindred of the people whom you have burned out and killed will be ready to lay down their lives to be avenged on your countrymen, nor wll the authorities be able to prevent them. The authorities are able to accord you admission into the city, but they are not able to asure to such of your countrymen as do enter a perfect immunity from harm. If, then, your countrymen were admitted, could you always have a large frorc here for their protection? A protecting force cannot remain here any great lgth of time; and if death and wounds were to be the condition of your entering it 'what bcen would your admission into the city be, even were o to obtain it? There is another point, Although shJ huaveo been flying against the city for several days, buLrning buildings and destroying life, nofinre has been teturned by the troops. This is really friendly and conceding ;Iit is enough to content you. And as you resorted to hostilities for A small mnatter; so now, for the sake of the people's' lives, you may suspend them; and, coinsidering 'what has Iica achieved at the present stage of proceedings, there allow them to terminate. Why add another difficuilty to the existing one, and so cause an interruption of the friendly understanding between outr countries ?I
Now, my lords, look at the condition of these people, and ask yourelves if it was possble to present to the persons at whose hands they lad sustained such an unmerited injury a petitionx couched in more pathetic terms. (Cheers.) My lords, these people asked for no reparation for the injuries which had been inflicted upon them. All they said was, " If you will only put a atop to these proceedings we are ready to renew our commercial intercourse with yo)o
the ancient footing ; we shal not ask for vengeance agaiast
you for spilling the blood of our peaceful citizens, or for bombarding our defeaceless city." (Hear, hear.) Now, my lords, let us see what the Americans did. The Amaericans, in tliecourse of these proceedings, happened toapyroach tool near to a fort, and it fired upon thiem. WVhAt did they do ? Instead of proceeding, in consequence, to bombard the town, they merely dropped down the river and silenced the fort 'which had so offended them, and, having done that, they quietly continued their trade on the footing on which it had always been carried on. (Cheers.) Tllere, my lords, waa real substantial instance of firing on the American flag,'anda it was deemed sufficient reparation to dismantle the fort from which the offence 'vas given;- and, that being done, the two parties resumned their former relationship without'any feeling of ill-blood. But we, other hand, taking the question of reparation, into our hands, went on fromn one act of cruelty to another until 'we committed an amnount of barbarism 'which 'woald have beeni wholly unjustifiable under, any circumstances 'whatever, 'which has produiced feelings among the Peo-Ple Of Cantos. againstourcountry which, ifear, cenituries wflsacarcely eradicate, and in consideration of which we shall have to deplore the day 'when such an important tbusiness was intrusted to hands so unworthy. (Hear, hear.)
Here, my lords, are mneasures adopted 'without instructions from the British Government by the British Plenxipotenttiary; here is this oficis making war of his own authority, not only without instrucetions, but contrary to his instrue. tions, without reference to the authorities of his own counltry at homne, and without, besides, the slightest comriunication with the Emperor of the country against which be was levying war. (Hear. hear.)i I baeroreai -f
your lordsaps a great portion of these dis ofating disilie sures. I have read wnih pin y lords, that such slighot
unds of offence should c en in the PI etext for ucha deplorable results. But, mY lords, I have the satisfaction to know that these are not neasures 'which oar likely to obtain the sanction of A British Government or a British Parliament. (Cheers.) The nationaal character 'will yet b vindicated, and will not be left to Esuffer as it appears in these papers in the eyes Of all civilized nations. I have confidence in your lordships' sense of justice. I have confidence in the manlyr and generous character of my countrymen. If I might, my lords, on this question make any special appeal, I wotld meaake it to that right rev, bench whieh it would have afforded me gratifica. tion to have seen more numerously occupied on this occasion. I think a question involving finch high anid importan. interests as this is not unworthy the serious consideration and the grave attention of the spiritual peers wheo occupy seats in this House. My lords, to them I would appeal as es thecialyandemphaticaly the menhof a eace. To themr I woud appeal as emphatically ,the servants of Hsi
who came to bring "peace on earth and good-will among men." I would appboste them as the legitimnate rebukera of oppression and. tyranny ; I 'wuuld appea to them as those wvhom their position peeuliarly qualifies to impart and inculcate the adoption of those high and holy maxims by -which 'we are commnandedl not to go beyond or defraud our neighbours in anything, and, if it be possible, as far as in us lies to live peaceably 'with all mnen. It i3 for them, with their high authority and their "rest and legitimate infuence, to endeavour to stay the npYnif ted hand of violence and op paression and rebuke the hEdlding of innocent blood. To them viewuld emphatically .ippo;al wyls-ther they believe that such scene as thlose I have bi~en' deserib;Lsg, and enacted by a f6keign on a heathen people, are esleriJated to advahee the intrests and diffuse the blessinigs ot ia~ holy religion 9f 'Which they are
the ministers and guardians? (Load cheers.) What, my lords, must be the feelings of the Ignorant native of Chins wlhen, after hearing ort ose maxims of forbe r- ance, long-suffering, and kindness taught and inculcated by the Christian relgion, he finds the representatives of a Cbristian nation uncharitable, unforbearing, barbarous, and blood-thirsty ? Would he not say, " Away with such a religion as that; I prefer to make use of my own lights, and,
enerating the Spirit of Heaven, to act according to the Spint of Heaven?" Bat the Chineso may possibly say, these men are engaged in warlike or in mercantile pursuits; they are blinded by the love of gain, and disregard the principles of their religion. Bat possibly, my lords, the Chinese may he aware that in the country from which those officials came there is au august assembly, cornpsed of the noblest and the highest in the land; and they may think that there
,ossibly may stand up men to protect and vimdicate that Christian religion on such an occasion as this; that within this Rouse sit the fathers of the Christian Church-menawho by their profession and their holy cwling, being wvboly separated from political prejudices and party feelings, are the especial guardians of religion and virtue, doing honour, besides, to the discussions of such
an assembly by the influence they exercise over its deliberations, and vindicating tbe Christian charazter of the country. (Cheers.) My lords, I look with confidence to that right rev, bench that they will not, so far as they are concerned, leave a false impression on the minds of an ignorant heathen nation, but, on the contrary, that they wll stand forward in defence of humanity and relig'ion. (Renewed cheers.) I shall rejoice if the members of the Christian Church shall place themselves at the head of this
eat cause, which is the cause of humanity and eivilization. a ould deeply deplore if, upon such an occasion, the Church, as represented by the right rev, bench in this House should give an uncertain sound, if their sanction should be extended to deeds of violence which in their consciences they cannot approve, or if they should allow any feelings, of whatever character, to overbear what must, I think, be their solemn convictions on this question (cheers); but, my lords, if I should be disappointed in this hope as regards the right rev, bench, then I turn with undituinished confidence to the hereditary peerage. (Cheers.) I make my appeal to those who have done me the honout of listening with patience, with exemplary patience, to the long and painful statement which I have laid beforeyou. To the hereditary peerage I turn humbly, earnestly, but with confidence-(and this is the last word with which I shall trouble your lordships)-I appeal to them by their vote this night to declare that they will not sanction the usurpation by foreign authorities of that most awful prerogative of the Crown, the declaring of war; that they wil not tolerate, nor by their silence appear to approve, upon light and trivial grounds of quarrel, and upon cses of doubtful justice as far as regards the merits of our first demands, the capture of commercial vessels' that they will not tolerate the destraction of the forts of a friendly country, that they will not tolerate the bombard ment and the shellinz of an undefended and commercial city ; and that they vdll not on any consideration give the sanction of thelr voice to the shedding of the blood of un. warlke and innocent people without warrant of law and without moral justification. The noble lord, who resmed his seat amid loud and general cheering, concludedby proposing the following resolutions -
" that this House has heard with decp regret of the in. terruption of anicable relations between oier Majesty's sabjects and the Chinese authorities at Canton, arising out of the measures adopted by Her Majesty's Chief Superintendent of Trade to obtain reparation for alleged infractions of the supplementary treaty of the 8th of October, 184.
" That in the opinion of this House the occurzence of differences on this subiect rendered the time peculiarly unfavourable for pressing on the Chinese authorities a claim for the admittance of British subjects into Canton, which had been left in abeyance since 1849, and for supporting the same by force of arms.
"That in the opinion of this House operations of actual hostility ought not to have been undertaken wzithout the express instructions, previously received, of Her Majesty's Government, and thaS neither of the subjects adverted to in the foregoing resolutions afforded sufficient justification for such operations."
The Earl of CLARENDO'i.-I can assure your lordshipi that I rise with a deep sense of the important duty which devolves upon me to follow the noble earl in the course of his long and powerful speech, displaying as it does more conspicuously than ever those talents and energies for which we have long known that he is remarkable. (Hear, hear.) The noble earl has certainly neglected nothing whioh the most careful investigation, the most ingenious interpretation of documents and instrements, the boldest assertion of facts, the most touching appeal to your sympathies, and the most commanding eloquence could effect. (Eear, hear.) But I have the sarne confidence which the noble earl has in your lordships. Ij feel that you will regard the facts of the case as they reaUy stand, and not the facts as they have been presented to you by the noble earl; and that, bearing in mind the great interest which we have at stake-bearing in mind also the expediency, the policy, the necessity of upholding the servants of the Crown abroad when they are in the right, as in my conscience I believe they have been on the present occasion -I say, my lords, that I feel, liko the noble earl opposite, full confidence that your lordships will this night, in your judicial capacity, lay asid all party considerations, that you will look at the evidence as it stands, and that you will not condemn Her Majesty's officers in China or Her Majesty's Government at home for having approved a line of conduct which they unavoidably though mnost reluctantly felt compeUed to parsue, (Hear, hear.) In this House there can be but one feeling of regret at the interrnption of relations between Her Majesty's subjects and the Chinese authorities, but when my noble friend calls those relations amicable he is far from representing the real facts of the case. The truth is that, on the one side, there has has been for a long series of years an habitual determination on the part of the Chinese to humiliate us, to restrict our rights and violate our privileges, and when on the other side, as a natural consequence, there has been great annoyance and irritation, although tempered by a moderate and forbearing spirit, I think such relations can hardly be called amicable. (Hear, hear.) So far has this been the case that for many years there has been no resident in Canton, official or unofficial, no matter to what nation he belonged, who has not felt that the present state of things was unendurable, that it could not last, and that sooner or later a rupture must take place. A rupture has now taken place, and it has been attended with consequences which we must all deeply deplore. But on the other hand your lordships must remember that all those persons who were either on the spot or who were able to watch the course of these events as they occurred, -all those persons, who wil moreover be great sufferers in their property by the rupture-have approved the course which has been taken, and while all have lamented it all have admitted its necessity. (Hear, hear.) These persons would certainly, if they were here this evening, or could be represented here, ask your lordships not to give your assent to the condemnatory resolutions proposed by the noble earl. They feel that whatever they possess in China, whatever they hope for as regards trade, the safety of their lives and property, the progress of their trade, aU depend upon the maintenance of the treaty rights, upon the respect paid to the British flag, and upon the protection which it affords. (ear.) If those rights can be violated, if that flag can be insulted with impunity, there is an end to aU safety for British residents in China; British merchants wiU henceforth carry on their business and their interests will depend upon a mere sufferance, which may be withdrawn in a day, and they will be in reality as dependent upon the mercy and forbearance of the Chinese authorities as those persons at present delight to represent them to the Chinese nation as being. (Hear, hear.) This case of the Arrow may be a miserable case, as the noble earl saYs; it may.notbe worthy of the deplorable consequences which have ensued from it; but a principle is involved in it, a right has been violated, and I say that the consul and the officers of Her Majesty in China could not, without a complete dereliction of their du.ty, have acted otherwise than they have acted. (Cheers.) With respect to the ordinance, your lordships will be aware that the origin of these instruments was for the purpose of preventing abuses to which the British flag was subject when borne on the authority of colonial registers. The earliest notice of their abuse is from Sir John Bowring, who says:-
"The question presents grave difriculties; a vessel no sooner obtains a register than she escapes colonial jurisdiction; carres on her trade within the waters of China ; engages probably in every sort of fraudulent dealings, and may never aPS agai to render any account of her pro-
ceedings orro bemctderesponsiblefo-rherMlegalacts.th Imperial Act which now regulates the conditions upon which

security in the unlawful se of the British flag, and the object of the ordinance is, as far as possible, to nrovide
such local guarantees as appeared compatible with the general regulation of Parliamnnetary authority, and are neessitated by the peculiar condition of public affairs in
Sir John Bowving further e.xplains w;hat; was the object of the ordinance. He. says:
" The necessity of legislation was pressed irresistibly on my attention, not only as governor of Hongkong, but as
chief superintendent of British trade in China, in coasequence of multitudinous abuses which had grown up, and which were aggravated by the disorganized state of China,
and the confusion produced by all those discordant elements in which I had been directed by Her Majesty's Government to p3reserve, a strict neutrality as between political beRllgerents, while it was frequently impossible to distinguish the marauder and the pirate from those who claimed to be rebels seeking only to over-
throw the Manchou Government, And the poptlation of this colony, from its very nature and from the universalitY of secret associationas, could not fail of being engaged in
airtizanship likely to compromise the British namne aud the 0ritish lag The difficulty of .deciding who is, and WhO

It was, then, for the purpose of restricting the abuse of the
Bktish nlag, carried by virtue of the Imperial Act, that this
gr4ign was passed, and the right of the ArrQw to carrytho
British flag was conferred by the ordinanoe passed in arch and whiclL cane into immediate operation. wo rizht wra
conferred by the second ordinance;, this ordinance was not confirmed by order in Council, and, being only approved by Her Majesty in September last did not apply at Hongkong until after these events had tal-en place at Canton. The ordinance of March 1 contravened no existing British law. It pased before tbe Merchant Shipping Act passed. As I 'aid, it came into immediateoperation, and itwould certainly have contravened that Act if it had bestowed a British regis. ter, but the only thing it bestowed was a colonial register for trading between China and Hongkong. (Hear.) The practice is, as your lordships will be aware, for the Crown to legislate in conjunction with the Colonial Legislature in the case of conquered colonies, Now, Hongkong was a conquered colony, and there was nothing in the Act pwssed by the Legislature of Hongkong, aD conrirmed by thio Crown, which the Crown was not strictly entitled to confirm, orwhich contravened anyexisting Actof Parliament. (Hear.) My noble friend does not appear to be aware that the same hind of license has been granted in other places for a very onsiderable period. At Gibraltar and Malta the Queen, by an order in Council, has granted licenses to carry the British flag, which of courss implied British protection not only to British-born subjects, but to persons who had been 15 years resident in those colonies, and the case of the licenses granted at Hougkong to Chinese who are lessees of the Crown is a strictly analogous case, and, for my own part, I consider that this ordinance was perfectly legal, and that the Legislature bas a6 perfect right to confer a register which camries with it the protection of the British flag. I wi now read to your lordships the opinion of the 1ocal Attorney-General upon this subject, and the reasons which have led to that opinion. The Attorney-General for Hong. kong says:-
" The colony of Uongkong, with a Chinese population exceeding at the present tiue 60,000, hardly contains 10 Chineso who can legally be called British subjects, for it has not been deemed advisable to naturalize the Chinese here, and the recent settlement of the colony prevents the poss,ibility of their having become subjects by birth. The great proportion of the resctable part of this population have, however, constituted them seves bon4 fide British subjects by becoming Crown tenants of leaseholds for long terms oE years (a tenure of which an alien is incapable), and bypermanent settlementhave evinced the clearest intention of perfecting themselves, inthe persons of their descendants
Bntish snbjects secundum leges,as well as defacto. Itlierefore, as lawv adviser to the Crown, deemed it my duty to advise the granting of registers to such Chinese as had, by becoming Crown tenants, so far as in them lay made themselves British subjects, and whose discharge of the obligation taken upon them could be guaranteed by other Crown tenants. Ent there had been serious complaints from the naval commander-in-chief, and from the consular and Chinese authorities, of the abuse by smaUl craft ca-rying the British flag, of the treaty regulations, and as the prosperity of this colony (so much increased of late) depends entirely, so far as regards the native population, upon the coasting trade, which is carried on in vessels ranging between 20 and 100 tons, it was deemed advisable by the colonial Government that an ordinance should be passed wbich, in no way interfering with the granting of Imperial registers to long sea-going ships, should yet facilitate the obtaining of English papers of a certain description by colonial craft, and should also give the colonial Government means which it could not possess under an Imperial register of punishing violations of the treaty With Chin,a. It was not thought necessary to fix the local limits within which the colonial register should run, because the character of the craft which require those registers and the objects of the local trade render it a matter of the utmost improbability that a colonial registered vessel could go anywhere else than along the coast of China; and, as the colonial register is obtained on the strength of a declaration that the vessel is solely to be employed in trade with Cbina, and a falsifying of that declaration involves the penalties of the bond which accompanies the register, it was hardly deemed necessary to specify any geographical boundaries."
I say again, my lords, that the case is strictly analogous with the system which prevails at Gibraltar and Malta, and which also obtains in tho British settlements in the Gulf of 7Ialacca, Singapore, and Malabar. I will read to your lord. ships a memorandum which was given to me by Ur. Crawfurd, Governor of Singapore, upon this subject. Mr. Crawfard says:-
" The condition of the British settlements in the Straits of Malacca much resembles tbat of Hongkong. It will be useful, therefore, to see under what conditions it bas been expedient in these to grant registration to native shipping. The population of the three settlements amounts to 225,000, of which 90,000 are Chinese. I may confine my remarks, however, to Singapore. the most important of these settlements, and which is not above five days' sail distant from Hongkong. It contains a population of 70,000, of whom no fewer than 50,000 are Chinese, some of these being British subjects by birth, as born under the British flag, but the great majority aliens, as born in China or the Datch posessions in the Archipelago. Both British-born and alien Chinese are, without distinction as to nationality, owners of coasting craft and of square-rigged vessels making distant voyages, and all sail under the British flag. I have before me the names of 12 square-rigged vessels owned by Chinese lying in the harbour of Singapore, ranging from 150 to 669 tons, seven of them exceeding 332 tons burden. The coasting Chinese and other native craft sail by registered passes, which run for a year only, and are renewable. These passes resemble the certificates of registration of the Bongkong Ordinance of 1855, only that the conditions on which they were granted were far less stringent."
But, my lords, to leave this part of the subject, the real question is whether the loreha Arrow was considered by the Chinese authorities at Hongkong a British vessel and entitled to carry the British flag and claim British protection. That is the real question for us to consider. This lorcha is a vessel described as belonging to foreigners, the term bsing used in contradistinction to the word junk, and, in fact, it is always looked upon as a foreign vessel, and the question is whether the lorcha Arrow was considered a British vessel by the Chinese authorities. Now, my lords, I say that she was known there as a British ship, trading in the Canton river, and all the proceedings which took place upon her entering that river proved that she was look-ed upon as a British vessel. It is true that the Arrow had been seized by pirates, that there had been an adjudication, that she had been bought, and that there had been an arbitration; but the end of all was that she had come into the possession of a Chinese lessee of the Crown, to whom a register had been granted. The Arrow was then upon the Canton river with a British register, with the British flag flying. I say with a British register, beeause, although the time for which the register wa3 granted had expired, the vessel was not deprived of the protection of that register, inasmuch as she was still at sea, and vessels at se are not called on to renew their licenses until they reach the waters of the colony to which theybelong. TheArrow was at sea, the BluePeter was up, the British flag was flying, and there can be no doubt that a deliberate insult was intended to a British vessel and to the British flag. The Arrow was boarded by an armed Chinese foree from a large and heavily armed vessel, and 12 out of 14 of the crew were taken away, and, as if to show the animus of these Chinese officers, or else the instructions under which they acted, the British flag was hauled down. Now, in dealing with the Chinese there is no article of the treaty which comes so constantly into operation as the 17th artiele, which has been read by the noble earl, by which if any person on board a British ship be suspected of a crime a communieation should be made to the highest civil authority, in order that a strict inquiry may be made, and upon the man's admission of guilt, or upon its being proved against him,, he is t be given up to the Chinese authorities. The greatest possible importance has been attached to the value ofthis article as regards maintaining peaceful relations with a coentry so populous as China, and which contains so many malefaetors of such various kinds who might take refuge in our settleerents. And, in order to obviate any inconvenience which might thus arise, this article, which is, in point of fact, a species of extradition treaty,has been deemed of the utmost importance. Nothing can be plainer than that the proper course to adopt, according to this article, is first to give information as to where a criminal is supposed to be, in order that an inquiry may be held, and the man be delivered up if he admit his guilt, or if it be proved against him. Now,in the present case no such course was adopted. One man, I believe, was suspected, and he was an old man, so much older than the rest that it could not be difficult to identify him - but instead of applying, according to the provisions oi the treaty, to the civil authorities to institute an inquiry, the crew of the lorcha were violently taken out of her, notwithstanding the vessel being under the protection of the British flag. Now, my lords, I will ask any one of your lordships to place himself in the position of Mr. Parkes, and consider if he would have acted differently. I think, my lords, that there has been a great deal of unjust declaruation aint 3Ir. Parkes, for he has been accused of hav-
ing acted with precipitation. Now, my lords, I thinkit due to Mr. Parkes to say that I am personally acquainted with him, and I consider bina very intelligent, able, and gentlemanlike man. He has been placed on several occa. sions in most tryig circumstances, in which he has displayed great judgment; and I know no man more likely to act in dificult circumstances under a deeper sense of resronsibility. I ask your lordships to place yourselves in the same position, and consider how you would have acted. if dr. Parkes had shrunk from demanding satisfaction for the violation of the rights of British ships he would have compromised the flag of England and the protection which that flag affords. Your lordships must remember that if be had shrunk from that course he would have given a comparative sanction to the violation of the treaty, and if he had allowed his expostulations and then is threats to be violated, can any one doubt that the Chinese would have seen in the cirqumstanco a fresh triumph over the "white devils and outsido barbarians," and that they would have proceeded to still graver inults ? What did ,Ir. Parkes do ? Berepresented to the High Commissioner 'he mauner in vhich the treaty bad been violated, and reluested that the men might be restored, to be dealt with wccording to the provisions of the treaty, and that
m apology shoud be made for what had occnrred. It is a kina of cse which might have occurred between two f the greatest Powers in the world; and really, if our ordships can dismiss from your minds those strong fee-nega .n favour of China and the Chinese authorities with which ,he noble earl has sought to inspire you, and will try the case iybringing it a little nearer home, I thinkthatyour opinion vfll be somewhat different from that which the noble earl eemsto entertan.

(Cheers.) Would not such a man be considered mad or worse than mad who thus exposed Liverpool or the Channel Islands to attack, and the country to awar with France or the United States on such grounds as these ? And what would be our surprise if afterwards we heard that in the Senate of the United States or of France resolutions were proposed condemning in the strongest manner all the American or French officers who had been engaged in the aflair, and a spech madeeulogizing
in the strongest terms the British authority who had acted insuchaimanner? ("Hear,bear," and alugh.) Sucha case as that could not indeed occur. It would te highly inconsistent with our state of civilization and with the rules of internationallaw; but these things do oocur in China and they therefore prove that there is not, that amount of civilization there and not that respect for international law which exist among other nations; and, painful though it may'be to admit it, and repugnant to our feelings as it is, I fear that we must come to the conclusion that in dealing witha nation like the Chinese if we intend to preserveany amicable or useful relations wlth them, we must make them sensible of the law of force, and must appeal to them in the manner which alone they can appreciate. (Hear, hear.) Your lordshi wiUl remember that the Imperil Commissioner denieathat the vessel was British and objected to the system of registry; and he had an ob4ect in doing so, because he thus preserved to himself the nght of treating all other British vessels in the same way and thus ho would deter those Chinese who were in the bit of taking service with Englishmen from continuing to do so, under a fl
which no longer afforded them protection But the Comnissioner was afterwards inconsistent with himself because he did admit the binding force of the treaty, b sendirng back some of the men whose restoration bad been demanded. But he did not do it in conformity with the treaby, and he absolutely refused to make the apology which was demanded of him. The apology which ws required was a just and reasonable one, and you should never make any other demand upon the Chinese- but having once madesuch a demand it isimpossibleto witidraw it, for if you do your motives will always be misunderstood, you will be regarded as cowards, and insults will be heaped upon you accordingly. (Hear, hear.) It was therefore manifest from the first moment that these demands were made upon the Chinese authorities that it was absolutely necessary to insist upon them as reparation. Accordingly, when the matter passed into the Admiral's hands he seized a ivnk, thus proving to the Imperia Commissioner thaLt we'were really in earnest, which the commissioner might naturally have doubted after the numerous insults which we had submitted to. But if we were justified in having recourse to force at all, it was manifest that the force ought to have been adequate to the resistance which we were likely to meet with and to the object which we had in riew, which was to put an end to the system which had so long prevailed of violating our rights. Those measures, barbarous though they certainly may appear, might at any moment have been brought to a close by the Imperial Commissioner, but he refused to do that, because he was determined-as was proved by all his acts-to persevere in thecourseof which wehadcomplained. (Hear, hear.) We have no right to say that the measures which were had recourse to were altogether so impolitic as my noble friend thinks because we have yet to seo whether the Court of Pekin wZ now see the necessity of placing things on a more satisfactory footing. Anybody rho reads the papers I am sure will admit that the entrance into Canton had in reality nothing to do with this question of the treaty, and I am convinced that we never should have heard of it if the case of the Arrow had not occurred. (Hear, hear.) The noble earl said a great deal about the monomania of Sir J. Bowring with respect to admission into Canton. I fully admit that Sir T. Bowring attaches the greatest importanco to that object, butI am sure, under the instructions which he has received and the knowledge which he has of what are the feelings of the Government on the subject that he never would have commuitted any act of which the dovernment or this country could have had to complain by way of gratifying thatypredominant sentiment and opinion of his. (Hear, hearz) I say that we never should have heard of it if that case of the Arrow had been satisfactorily settled ; but it was manifest that personal communication with the authorities in Canton would be the best way of coming to an understanding; and Sir J. Bowring and Sir Michael Seymour did not insist upon the indiscriminate entrance of British subjects into Canton, sas they had a pe-fect right to do, but they simuply asked for adinissnon for themnselves to communicate with the commissioner; so that so far from being an unfortunate moment formiaking the demand, I think that it was a very fitting time for the purpose. It was made when-according to all our official reports, seeing that an entrance never would be obtained into Canton until the people were made to feel our power-Sir J. Bowring and Sir hi Seymour wanted to parley with the authoritie, believing that a written correspondence would only contribute to feelings of exasperation and irritation, and that a parley afforded the best chance of coming to an understanding. (Hear, hear.) I will now say a few words with respect to the question of admission to Canton, upon which I tlink there is some misapprehension in this country, and particularly with reference to the feelings of the people, about which the-noble earl enunciated some very eloquent aud liberal axioms. Keying, who certainly was one of the wisest and most experienced of the officers we have had to do with there, was of opinion that there was no insurmountable difficulty m carrying out what he called our just demands, and that the feeling of the people about which such a bugbear had been made was always stimulated by the authorities. My lords, we well know that n Asiatic provinces the authorities can move tho ignorant and fanatical people to any amount of outrage against the Christians, but that is no reason why we should be prevented from entering those provinces or calling upon the authorities, as we alweys do, to maintain order and to make themselves responsible for the preservation of Christian life and property. (Elear, hear,) In 1840 Sir J. Davis stated that the entrance was refused under the pretext of the people's wishes, but that he felt perfectly certain that, provided he had the sanction and suport of Her Majesty's Government, he would obtain the fu ent of that important condition of the treaty. That despatch was addressed to my noble friend below me, who in his clear and able reply recognized the importance of the entrance into Canton, and gave Sir J. Davis authorityto suspend the handing over of Chusan to the Chinese until that object had been accomplished. Sir J. Davis accordingly entered into negotiations, and arrived at the agreement read by the noble earl opposite, by which the right of British subjects to enter into Canton was fully recognized. But it was not tiUl 1847, and not tiU after a successful military operation, that the Imperial Commissioner consented to fix a day for the fulfilment of that condition of the treaty. In 1848 Sir G. Bonham, who succeeded Sir J. Davis, applied to Len to send anofficerto Hongkongin order to consultwith him abont variousmatters which were indispute between the two countries, particularly with reference to the entry into Canton in the following year. Leu entirely denied that any such privilege had been conceded by the treaty, and altogetEer repudiated the agreement entered into by Keying. Nevertheless, at that time the Council of Hongkonz, in obedience to the Emperor's orders, reported that the English had a rightto enter Canton in consequence of the agreement with Keying, that they might enter without any harm being done, and that, after all, it mattered litte whethertheywere located outside or inside the cty. Sir G. Bonham still tought there w;as no expectation of getting into Canton; hut he expressed a very strong opinion upon the subject, stating that-
Without assuming for one moment to criticize the act or motive of any of Her Majesty's servants intrusted in past years with the administration of affairs in China, while expressing now my conviction that, neither in this matter nor any other, negotiation unsupported will avail, I cannot refrain from regretting that no advantage has been taken of the few opportunities that have offered of humbling in the Cantonese (at whose hands our countrymen have suffered so much both of insult and injury) that arrogant spirit to which is to be attributed their obstinate refusal to concede to us a right, in itself of minor importance, but the denial of which, as it is made, is calculated to prejudice us nationally in the eyes of the Chinese in all parts of the empir."
Such was the opinion of Sir G. Bonham, and when the time approached for the fulfilment of Keying's engagement he wrote home that intimidation was to be resorted to, and that the people's wishes were to he the pretext of a refusaL He then suggested whether it might not be well to give up the question altogether, although he did not recommend it, rather than continue the dispute with the Chinese. A middle course was recommended to him. He was told to remonstrate strongly, andto put before the Chinese the consequences of not fulfilling their treaty engagements. The result wan that Len and Lieutenant-General Yeh immediately declared that al discussion on the subject had been abandoned, and they received Imperial honours for the construction they had put upon our display of moral force. (Hear, hear.) In this state things have remained ever since. Every Government of this counltry has temvorized.
oesmnng not to enforce our manifest treaty right. I do not
say that that is an unwise policy. I think it is better to bear with evils that we know of in China rather than to run theriskof war; butyour lordships ought to remember that that is not the feeling of the British residents in China. This question of entrance into Canton has a wider bearing and greater consequences than might at first sight be imagined. Themeasure-initrelf insulting-is always cited as a proof of our humiliating position, and of our inability when we were at war with China to secure for ourselves by force of arms that to which we are fairly entitled. Our exclusion from Canton is even made the subject of taunt and reproach to the other ports where we are admitted, and where large numbers of Cantonese reside, and it has been the fertile source of that tendency to mischief and deterioration that has marked our relations with China.
In 1846 it was the cause of a serious riot at Sonchong, when the lives of the foreign residents were endangered, and at Shanghai it was used by the Cantonese to iuvolve British subjects in collision with the natives. Moreover, the present anomalous and nominally amicable state of things excites the greatest apprehension in the minds of all foreigners, because their exclusion from the walls of Canton im lies the seclusion within the walls of all tho Chinese
ant onhes, and their obstinate refusal to communicate with
oreign representatives upon those matters of every-day occurrence in which personal communication might prevent small differences from swelling into senous and perilous misunderstanding. I repeat, however,
there has been no change in the policy of the
Government, no diffeorent instructions have been sentout, and nothing would have been done if the Arrow question hadbeen satisfactorily arranged. But I contend that the Queen's of ficers were right and justified In taking that opportunity of seeking to obtain the nartial fulfibuent of the treaty as onc of the best means of leading to
the noble earl opposite (hear, hear), I should not have risen to address your lordships upon this part of the case, were it not that a report has been circulated that I entertained ,upon this subject opinions different from those of my noble .rxiend. There inofolndstionfor such an observation. I do nt fee that Ipossess any authority personal to myself upon a -queston of this nature; and I shaU therefore state shortly,
and rather in the form of a sumrmry, those argaments and I
asons which have led me to the vote which I am about to glve, and will leave your lordships to judge of their value, Et is impossible to 'soo too precise upon a question of this nature. (Hear, hear.) What is the chargo Nwhioh is on the ;present occasion preferred against the Chinese Governasent? It is that they have infringed tho 9th article -of the supplemental treaty whioh has been referred to. BY that supplemental treaty tbey had undertaken, in the -event of any Chinese having made his escape and concealed limaelf on board an English ship, that application should be made to the English authorities, and that if it were found that -the charge was well founded that the person so concealed should be delivered up. The very essence of this charge is
-that the party has taken refuge on board an English ship. I It cannot be pretended for a moment that, whero a Chinese culprit has taken refuge on board a Chinese ship and con-cealed himself there, the Chinese Government has not a per. fect right to apprehend him. (Hear, hear.) Lookin therefore to the language of the treaty, looking to the very reason of the thing, it must be confined absolutely to an Englsh slip. So the qaestion after all resolves itself into -this-was the Arrow, within the meaning and sense of this 4rrangemelt, an English ship I acsert-_nd I assert it in
'he very language of the Clunese Government-that in no rect whatever was the Arrow an Englishship. (Cheers.) 'hlsis the very esseLce and foundatio,n of the whole question. (Hear, hear.) Now, mn lords, allow me to lay doln a principle which no one wlnl successfully contest. It is ths-That yoa moay give any rights or any privileges to a foreigner or to a foreign vessel as -against yourselves, but not as against foreigners. That is -the answer to the case of the Mhanilla and two others of the same description to which the noble earl has referred. You may give nghtsas against yourselves. You may pass a law for that purpose. But you cannot give any rights to the -sv¢DIb of a oreign country by any of your laws as against t:.country of which he isa a snbject. (Hear, hear.) No -man can, by possibility, with any shadow of reason, dispute that proposition. You cannot, therefore, where you have a foreign ip, owned by a foreigner, convert that vessel into An English ship so as to bring it within the terms of this treaty. (Cheers.) My lords, when we are taWling of treaty transactions with Eastern nations, we have a kind of loose law and lo,.se notion of morality in regard to them. In order the better to appreciate the question, I vill change -the situation to America. I will take the c-se of an Ame-
,icacn subject residing in this metropolis, tho owner of an American vesseL You may, by a law, allow that vessel to -ssusme the English flag, and give it rights and privileges
rinat your owvn country, butyon cannot alter the character
tihWt Yvessecl a against the United States. You cannot *change its cbaracter. You cannot prevenit the Government -of the United States exercising its ordinary dominion over
it. (Cheers.) It is impossible any man can contend for so 4absurd, soviolentaproposition. (Rear, hear.) Imayrefer -to circumstances which occurred lately in illustration. By A law recently paesed certificates of natoralization may be granted to foreigners. A foreigner under a certificate of naturalization proceeded to the continent, to the kingdom -of which he was a subject, setting forth under the authority -of the certificate that he-was a British subject. " No," said
the Government, " you are not a British subject in virtue| .of that instrument of naturalization ; Fngland can give no such right as against us. You are the subject of this -country." The gentleman returned to England and complainee to the Home-office that he was disappointed as to
the effect of the certificate. I dare say your lordships have I -seen the answer of Mr. Waddington in the name of the Secretary of State for the Home Department. It said, " As against us, you may avail yourself of the certificate of naturalization, but as against foreigners, as against your own -country, it confers on you no right whatever." I say, therefore, my lords, on general principles, without resorting to any particilarargumont arising from any documents which have been laid on your lordshipe' table,-l say, on general principles, this being a Chinese ship, owned by a Chinese, nothing can at all affect the right of the Chinese Governmeat to go on board on any occasion to exercise dominion -over,it, to take out one or more of the crew, or to do any -act which they might be disposed to do in consequence of
-events brought to their knowledge. (Hear, hear.) If I mnake myself understood with respect to this propo. .sition and -were to pause here it wvould be unnecessary to proceed further; but -what is the next step? What
iis the instrument under -which it is contended there was a transfer of the character of the vessel, a transfer of ownership which converted this Chinese vessel into an English vessel ? It is an ordinanee of the Colonial Government. B that ordnance aChinese who has entered into the colony, who holds land under the Crown, and is the owner of a Chinese ship or any other vessel, may apply for a xegister, anid upon giving certain security the registry gives . him a right to use an English flag A register wan an to a man admitted to he -a Chinese. There is no dispute about the facts that the -owner was a Chinese, and the vessel a Chinese built vessel Now, by a law of the Colonial Legislature, a Chinese vessel cannot be converted into an English ship. I will not pre-tend to say rights may not be given by this colonial instru. snent, but I say you cannot make a vessel an English vessel by that means independently of the general principle I have ztated (hear, hear); you canuot make it an English ship; you cannot give the right to hoist an English flag. ahat is so clear, so indisputable, that I am quite sure no lawyer will controvert it, (Hear.) An Act of the Colonial Legislature can have no effect whatever against an Act of the Imperial Parliament. The Act of Parliament to v 'ich my noble friend has referred says in the most pre- 4 terms that nothing bt what is there set down shal be -themed a British ship. The Act is not confined to England
it iS not confined to these islands; it applies to all -our possessions, and it says no vessel can be deemed a British ship, or have the character of a British ship, unless it is ovwned by an Englishman, by a natural-born subject, by a naturalized subject, or by a person who has obtained letters of naturalization-{The Earl of Derby-" And has taken the oath of allegiance"]-and has takeni the oath of allegiance. In the face of this Act of Parliament the ordinance of the Colonial Legislature is absolutely nothing, and altogether void as far as it relates to the point in ques. tion. (Hear.) You cannotby a law of the ColoiiWalLegislature -convert this vessel into a British ship. (Cheers.) It is said,
"True, it may not be a British ship, but she had a British flag, and soue insult has been offered to the British flag." Wy ! Under the Act of Parliament no vessel can by law use the Britiah flag but a British ship, and any one who attempts to use a British flag, except on board a British .ship, is by the 133d section subject to a very grievous penalty. (Hear, hear.) Therefore, both on general prin-ciples, and on the particular point of this ordinance, the justfication in this case entirely fails. (Cheers.) Some-
thing was said about some certificate, some license which -was granted. A register was granted on -the 27th of September, 1855, to expire in a year. The vessel arrived on the 3d of October, six days after the expiration of the lieense. Thus, -when we seek the facts of the original ground of discussion in the case, we find that the licunse for the vessel had expired, and sbe was no longer a British vessel. Any Chinese autbority could go on board and seize criminals, as the vessel had ceased to be a British vessel, even according to the argurnent on the -other side. 1 believe the law is to the effect that a renewal of the license anustbe made seen days before the expiration of the old license, but no such thing was done in this case, Some ex. ,cuse had been suggested to the effect that the vessel was at sea, but there really is no foundation for that suggestiomi, for during the whole time the vessel was sailing up and down the river, and never was at sea at all. Thus, supposing that the lorcha had ever had a license and a British register it bad ceased, and her legal protection as such had also ceased. Sir J. Bowring, who is a distinguished humanitarian as well as plenipotentiary (a laugh), Yinself admits the register is void, and that the vessel was not entitled to h,,i-t the Englih flag. Now, mark whbathe says"The vessel had no protection, but the Chinese do not
inow this; for God's sake, do not whisper it to them." (Hear.) He persevered, too, for he said in effect, "We kiow the Chinese have not been guilty of any violation of treaty, but we will not tell them so; we wil insist upon a reparation, and a return of the men they have seized in a particular form." If the men were not returned in the form, what was to be the remedy? Why, to seize a junk, a war junk; if that was not sufficient seize more, until we Xcompelled then to submit, although we knew they had the right on their side, and we had no justice on ours (hear), and although the officer directing these nmeasures was the represeutatlve of the Sovereign of Great Britain, whose honour he was bound to protect, but -which he was compromising by plunging into a war. Was there ever conauct more aboniiimable, more flagiant, in Nvhicb, I will not say more fraudulent, but what is equal to fraud in our country, more false pretence has been put forward by a public man in the service of the British Government 7 (Hear.) Then -we are told of an insult offered to our flag. Why, the -vessel was not an English vessel; she had no right to carry our flag. If a man hoists a flag without authority to do so it would be a mnonstrous assertion to believe that bis own wrongful ict protects him. Sir J. Bowring, in a second letter, adniits it to be quite clear that the Arrow had no right to hoist the English fiig. He abandons that part of his case, but acds, " as the Chinese do not knowv it. we vill
can it an i,sult, And insist aponreparation." It is not true that the Chinese insulted our flag. There is not the
slghtest fnoundation for impa ting such an intention to the -hinese. xqHear, hear.) The -hole question is one of right -the e no efist said, "It is a Chinese ship. She is in no sense a British vessel,; why do you grant
-tegisters *hXoreign vessels? By eo doing you ewl reate discord and dissension betwveen us." I cannot point out just nowt the particular passages to wvhich I refer; bet I pledge in)self, having read the papers must carefully, that the Governor of Canton from the first raised the question, and that thero never was any intention to insult the English flag. (Hear, hear.) Now, let us go a little further and see wbat is urged in justification of these proceedings. The men taken from the vessel -were to be returned and returned in a particular manner. They vere returned
but not in proper form, and no apology was made. Now, my lords, really it Is too bad. Just consider vrhat was done. A war junk was seized. That was the first stepwas that sufficient punishment for the trans ression? No, xaid Sir J. Bowring, let us go further, and batter down a small fort. Surely, if the case was as it is represented to be
-on thithe side, SirJ Bowringmighthave paused at that sage,nd have said-"I have punished you enough. I have taken your junks and bettered your forts. I Will do nio more without instrutions from my Government." (HEear, hear.) He might have tbought-"I will not involve my country in war. What I have done has been for the vindication of my honour, but I will not take any further steps which may lead to war without the authority of my Government* But, no- he did not think so, and then where was he to sto ? He lad no inclination to stop; he ad no wis to dosoD. fHear.) Well, my lords, soon afterother forts Are seized in the neighbourhood of Canton, then the

'Power of tariying on defensive operations, hut to carry on offensive operations upon such a ground, upon such a pretenhe,. is one of the most extraordinary Proceedings to Lo tomiia in the history of the world. (HeAr- ear.)

Bot arngr and the noble earl below me (Lord Malmesbury), havinie ahd an opportunity of readin soniedespatehesfromSirn atwring,and becomingacquait
with the tone and temper of those documents, gave him instructions in the strongest terms not to undertake anybhostile measures without authority from the Government at home. It is quite clear from the papers laid on the table yesterday that from the first moment at which Sir John Bowring was appointed to the station he now fills his ambition was to procure what his predecessors had completely failed to effect-namely, an entry within the walls of Canton. (Hear, hear.) It would also appear from some of the letters of the Governor of Canton that the conviction was strongly impressed upon his mind that that was the ultimate object which the British Plenipotentiary had in viev. If even it bad been part of the original treaty that we should enter and carry on trade within the walls of the Imperial city, and if the Chinese Governor bad refused to perform that stipulation, stiXl I contend it would havo been quite unworthy of us to endeavour to accomplish that object through the intervention of mere local squabbles. (Hear, hear.) The shedding of blood, under the circumstances, by the local authorities appears to me to be & subversion of every sound principle and wholly indefensible. (Hear, hear.) It may be in the recollection of some of your lordships that Sir John Davis stipulated with Keying, the then conmissioner, that within two years, in peculiar cases, the admission within the walls shouild be allowed. But when Sir George Bonhana attempted to make arranements with the Governor to carry out that stipulation tne answer, of the Governor was that such would be the ungovernable rage of the population on such a proposition being made to them that it would be utterly impossible to carry it into effect. Sir George Bonham considered that was really a well-founded objection, and that was the reason why the stipulation was not insisted on. Subsequently, on Sir George Bonham being asked in 1846, by the noble lord Dow at the head of the Government (as we understood), what would be the disadvantages to commerce if we were excluded from within the walls of Canton Sir George replied that he could not say what the Government ought to do in the matter, but he could tell them what they ought not to do, and that was that they ought not to engage in any hostile act to accomplish the admission. (Hear, hear.) S r George added that he did not think it would be an object of great importance to our commerce to be admitted, but this he knew, that it would be dangerous in the last degree to make the attempt, more especially if it were made by force of arms. (Hoar, hear.) But our present plenipotentiary, disregarding aU these repeated warnings, and bent only u?on carrming his object of gaining admission within the walls of Canton into execution, has, for no necessary purpose whatever, plunged the country into war; and what is the result? Property to the large amount of 1,.500,000 dolars, beloneing to British subjects, is now impounded in the city of Canton; and in addition to that our factories are buTnt to the ground ; and all this is owing to the mischievous olicy of one of the most mischievous of men.

(Cheers.} I ait down, my lords, entirely concurting in the sentiments so ably expressed by my noble friend (the Earl of Derby) and cordiaUy supporting his motion. (Loud cheers.)
The LOP,D CHANCELLOR.-I quite admit that if there was nothing to complain of on the part of the Chiness authorities, all that has been done to obtain reparation was unjustifiable. My noble and learned friend (Lord Lyndhurst) set out by assuming that nothing has been done be the Chinese abthorities at Canton to furnish occasion for complaint, inasmuch as the ship in question was not of the character claimed for her by the British Admiral and the British Plenipotentiary. I contend, however, that the points to which my noble and learned friend has directed the attention of the House have little or no bearing on the question at issue. What are the facts on which we are to decide this motion? In the first place, it is said this was a Chinese, and not an English vessel Now, I shaU make no concealment upon this subject at all. I wil take from the papers laid before your lordsehips what I believe to be the true facts of the case. I wiU assume this [ship to have been built by a Chinese, say in Canton, and
that it was afterwards sold by a hong in Canton in such a way that a Chinese resident in Hongkong became the purchaser. There appears to be some inconsistency, some mystery, in the history of this transaction, but at all events the result was that a man with a Chinese name became the purchaser of this ship. That, I think, is clear. It was per. fectly clear also that the lorcha was marmed by a crew condisting almost entirely of Chinese, but with a British master. [Lord Lyndhurst.-" A nominal master."] That is quite true, but the object was to create the right to a colonial register, and such a right was created. Now, what was the supplementary treaty the alleged infraction of which gavo rise to this dispute.? The real meaning of the article quoted by the noble lord-and I am convinced that my noble and learned friend (Lord Lyndhurst) a-ill not contradict me-was not merely, according to the express words, that if natives of China have committed offences against their own Government they shall be delivered up; but, negatively, that Chinese Eubjects shall not be taken out of British ships until " a communication shall bemade to the propr English officer." (lear.) 'That is the obvious meaning of the article, and it is made clear by the furtber provision that if an Englishman escapes into China the Chinese authorities shell take care to deliver him up to the English authorities. Here isa
reaty, then, that no Chinese authorities shall enter into Bitish ships in order to seize supposed Chinese criminals, except through the instrumentality of the British consul. What is alleged is, that this lorcha, being within the meaning of the treaty a British shi, did go within the Canton waters, and was forcibl; boarded by Chinese authorities, not through the imstrumentality of the Consul. (Hear, hear.) Now, had the Chinese a right to do tbat? I assume it as a fact that the British flag was flying at the time. There is really no room for dispute as to this fact. The strongest argument in support of it is that when the first complaint was made to Commissioner Yeh of this among other grievances the Commissioner, in his reply of the YUth of October, did not deny it. It-was only four or six days afterwards that he said, "I am told it is not so, and that there was no flag flying;" but this was evidently an afterthought. Was this or was it not an infraction of the treaty? Certainly ; for, as between us and China, the Arro w was undoubtedly a British ship. (Hear.) If the British Government authorizes a ship to go into a foreign port and carry the Brtish flg, as between us and the foreign country, this is certainly a British ship. It may be that you had improperly authotized the use of the flag; this may give the foreign authorities a right to redress as against you, and if Yeh had represented this to Sir J. Bowring,and tihat officer had refused to attend to such a representation, he might have laid himself open to grave censure. That, however, was not the couirse taken by the Chinese authorities. They said, " We will of ourselves decide that the Arrow is not authorized to carry the British flag." Now, I have listened with attention to the noble earl's very powerful, very able, and in some respects very touching speech, but letinmescaution your lordships not, by sanctioning such a principle as I have just indicated, to involve yourselves in diculties the depth or the end of which I defy any man to fathomi or see. (Ciheers.) This maay be a case of comparatively small importance, but iftwe once yield to the notion that, having entered into a treaty of this kdnd with a foreign country, the authorities of that country may forcibly board a vessel and decide the point of nationality for themselvesq, vo sliall say to what important consequena this will lead ? (Hear, hear.) Tberefore, my lords, had this been entirely a foreign vessel, and unentitied to a British register, we, by the law of nations, were justified in the steps which we took. If we suffer an outrage from these semi-barbarous States without resenting it, those most familiar with the usages, thebhabits, and the feelings of those people assure me that the consequences will be such as we can hardly anticipate. (Bear.) Once admit that the British flag was hoisted and was by the authority of the Chinese Government hauled down, and I care not for the purpose of my argument whether they had a right to enter the ship or not; thev hauled down the flag, and the conseouences must be upon their onv heads. I believe I
nave argued this point upon perfectly sound principles of international law ; but Ido not think I am driven to any such extreme argument (hear), for I firmly believe that the Arrow was to all intents and purposes, within the meanin
of the treaties between China and this country, a British ship. (Hear, hear.) In conquered colonies it has always been the practice of the Crown, by virtue of itsprerogative, to grant wbat I may call local licenses. his h-s always been the case at Gibraltar, Malta, Singapore,Malacca, and various other places, and suoh an exercise of the prerogative has never been questioned. In the case of the Mediterranean pases, tbey have generally been granted on the authority of orders in Council which shows that the facts have been brought deliberately enough under the atten. tion of the Government. lo doubt the practice generally bas been to grant such pawses to British subjects, but this is to be accounted for by the fact that up to very recent times it has been the policy of the country that no one ought to have anything to do with British shipping except British subjects. This, however, was not an invariable rule, because in 1819 there was an ordinance at Gibrnltar in which authority was given to issue these Mediterranean passes, not merely to British subjects, but to any person who bad been resident in Gibraltar for a certain number of years, showin,g clearly that the power of the Crown to do this was never disputed. If that be so, it follows that within local limlts the same might be done at Hongkong. The authorities there made an ordi. nance under the authority of which the Arrow was entitled to carry the British Rlag. The ordinance sass,-"It shall be lawful for Chinese residents within this colonyto apply for and obtain colonial registers, provided the person or persons applying as owners be regisered lessees or Crown lands within this celony." I asme that the owner of the Arrow was such a registered lessee. Another qualificatioa necessr yisthatthe7^tershou,ldbea a
British subject, or at least conversant 'with the E&glih,lai. guage, and in the present case the mater was a British subject, so that both of the necessary quafificetions were fulfilled, and therefore the Arrow ame strictly within the meaning of the treaty. It was a ship on which the crown might by its prerogativeconferthepnvilege of aBritislship. The Crown did so, and the vessel proeeded to the waters of Canton. By the 17th article of the treaty lorcbas are expressly recognized as ships trading in multitudes in those 'waters, and these are all navigated by Chinese sailors. If, then, we make a treaty relating to British Bhps, and these lorobas are the only ships trading in those waters, it appears tome that to say thatthat treatydoes not apply to thoseships is a rcductio ad absurdum. Now, -what aro the facts of tho case ? On the 8th of November the lorcha Arrow,which was under the protection of the British flag, was in the Canton waters, and 'while there a great outrage was committed. Some Mandarins came on board, and took from the ship sopie supposed delinquents without the sanction of the consul and in defiance of the treaty, and hauled down the Britishflag. Thatisashortstatementof thefactsof thecase with reference to the origin of the unfortuaate affair-for I am 'wiling to admit that it is unfortunate for everything which leads to bloodshed is of course unfortunate. Bat then comes the question, who was to blame in the first instance, because if an outrae was committed upon the British flag, which British officers could not pass over without loss of character, then the bloodshed and loss 'which may occur must be laid to the doors of those who were guilty of The outrage which rendered the exercise of force necessary. I shall not attempt to go through the details of the transactions which took place subsequently to the 8th of November. I have only risen with the hope of being able to satisfy your lordships that the treaty has been violated, and that the duty of resenting that violation having devolved upon us, all the evils which have occurred or which may occur are not to be attributed to the home Government or to the authorities abroad, but to those who, by committing an injustice in the first place, rendered an appeal to force not only justifiable but necessary. (Hear, hear.)
Earl GREY.-Before adverting to what has fallen from the noble and learned Lord Chancellor, I wish to say a few 'words with regard to a matterpersonal to myself, which was referred to in the speech of my noble friend (Lord Clarendon). My noble friend accused me of having on a former occasion made an erroneous statement with regard to a certain desratch which I addressed to tho general commanding at Hongkong in 1847. My noble friend stated that he was surprised to hear from me that I had, with the authority of the Duke of Wellington, sent out a despatch forbidding offensive operations to be undertaken without authority from the home Govemment. My noble friend added that he had entirely recovered, from that surprise, because when he read the despatch he found that it contained no such order generally, but that the order referred only to circumstances 'which had recently taken place, and meant simply to apply to the then existing circamstances. Now,1 venture to remind my noble friend thatthat despatch may not be very wel expressed, but that it was not intended to mean what he understood it to mean there cannot be a doubt, because two yeas after that despatch Sir G. Bonham wrote to Lord Palmerston that it would appear from the orders of the Colonial-office that he was actually prohibited from undertaking offensive operations without orders from the Government at home. It was so understood by the Cabinet of which my noble friend was a member, because in 1853 Mr. Merivale, by order of the Duke of Newcastle, sent a copy of it to General Jervois, and that, according to general practice, implies a repetition of the order. My noble friend stated that he should view with the utmost alarm the issuing of such an order, but I beg to say that I heard with the utmost alarm that such an order exists no longer. (Hear, hear.) The order did not apply to defensive opera tions, because they might at anytime be rendered necessary in support of the honour of the flag, but solely to offensive operations, vwhich I do not think ought to be undertaken by subordinate officers. (Hear, hear.) I believe I have the authority of the law of nations for that opinion. (Hear.) Vattel lays down the principle that no officer ig authorized to make reprisals or to use force to obtain redress for an injury until every other means of obtaining redress have been ex.bansted, and among these means I think he mentions one which cannot be neglected, and that is a direct application of the Government of the country injured to the Government of the country by which the injury is iDflicted. (Hear, hear.) Now, my lords, let us consider what is the danger of the principle for 'which my noble friend contends ; and, first, let me say that if it holds good for China it muast hold good elsewhere. (Hear, hear.) Will you admit the principle that any cousul or vice-consul in Central America, where, perhaps, they are more liable to receive insults than in
hina, shaU have the power-and he may be an excitable person-of levying war on his own respoDsibility, and with. out reference to the home Government 1 Such a principle, I confess, appears to me to be fraught with danger, and I think that the speeth of my noble friend shows the necessity which there is for this House to express their disapproval of such a principle by assenting to the resolutions of the noble earl. But, passing from this personalmatter, I come now to what has faUen from the noble and learned lord on the woolsack. I w?s very glad to bear my noble and learned friend acknowledge that unless we have a good case with regard to the Arrow all the proceedings from first to lsst were wrong. He further stated that if the Arrow was a British vessel 'we certainly had a right to act as 'we have done. There I quite agree with him. I admit that if the Arrowv was a British ship the Chinese had no right to board her, but they should have applied to the British consul in accordance with the provisions of the treaty for the surrender of criminals. Then, my lords comes the question, was the Arrow a British vessel? f cannot help expressing my astonishment at the principle enunciated by my noble and learned friend on the woolsack, who says that every vessel is a British vessel, as against a foreign Power, which the British Government acknowledges. Now, my lords, I can admit no such doctrine. We are told by my noble friend the Seoretary of State that, at all events, the British fla was flying, and that It was hauled down. That, my noble friend said, was indisputable; but, surely, if he had listened to the observations of the noble earl opposite, he would have seen that that question was open to very considerable doubt; and, for my own partk I believe that the British flag was not flying. The point, however, is immaterial, because no man pretends that any pirate hoisting a British flag without authority is thereby entitled to claim the privileges of a British vessel. The question turns upon this :-Was the Arrow entitled to hoist British colours . Upon this it appears to me that the case is so clear and simple that I am at a loss to understand how there can be any doubt upon it. For 200 years it has been the practice of this country to declare what are British ships and what are not, aad to give to them certain privileges which were withheld from other ships. The navigation laws have always been considered sacred, and no colonial legislature has authority to deal with any question arising out of them. (Hear, hear.) In 1844 considerable alterations were niade in the navigation laws, and the statute was divided into several parts. Section 17 provided that the second part of the Act should apply to the whole of Her liajesty's dominions everywhere, and it then went on to describe in clear and distinct terms, which have already been quoted, what shall be deemed to be a British ship. That clause is followed by another, which declares that any ship anywhere hoisting British colours, and not owned by persons described in the Act, is ipso facto forfeit to Her Majesty. Am I now to be told that the enactment of the British Parliament is to be overruled in the river of Canton, ihere Hongkong has no more jurisdiction than it has in Jamaica, byan ordinance of Hongkong? There is a question of public policy and public principle of the greatest moment involved in this matter. Parliament preserves the right to decidewbatareBritish shipsandwhatare not. Itisanlmperial right, and I ask, can anythmg be conceived which is more distinctlyand more properly an Imperial right? By hoisting the Iritish flag vessels become entitled to British protection, and we may be involved in difficulties of the most serious nature with foreign nations if that power be imnproperly exercised. (Hear, hear.) It is true that at all times certain small vessels within the waters of a colony have had fiscal privileges granted them by the colonial legislatures. I grant that there has been that exercise of power in former times; but then we come to the Act of 184, and Parliament then, without any reservation of Crown colonies or any other place, expressly enacted that the rules which it laid down should apply to every part of Her Majesty's dominions in every part of the world. My noble and learned friend very truly stated that what we have to consider is, whether the Arrow was a British ship, as recog. nised by the treaty. Now, I beg to call your lordshipi.
attention to this subject. By the general law of nations, if the Arrow had been an undoubted British ship lying in the Canton river, the Chinese authorities-would have been perfectly entitled to board her, to seize Chinese subjects, ad to have dealt with them as the laws of the Chinese require. In our own waters 'we don't go to the French or American Consul in order to board a French or American sbip; but the English authorities act at once-board the shipa and ake from them any persons found on beard, whether American, French, or EKnglish, who are accused of offences
ever, that general lawv ofwnsations isi limirted by thea expres stipulations of tb rat,hich provide that Chinese sub-
be takenL out of E,nglish ships by the Chinese authorities 'without reference to the English ConsuL. My noble friend the Secretary of State said that the whole defence of the Chinese rested upon the allegation that the Arrow was not a British ship within the fair intent and meaning of the treaty Row la the character of the Arrow to be ascertained ? There is no definition of a British ship in the treaty. The 17th clause, referred to by the noble earl the Secretary of State, .says "British lorchas and other vessels," but doe not define
'what a British lorcha is. A lorcba is a vessel of a particular build; but it does not follow that all lorchas, any more than all sloops, are British. According to the rules for the construction of treaties, a British ship for the purpos~es of this treaty, maust be what 'was regarded as a British shiP when the treaty 'was made. Now, by the law of England which was then in force, 'no ship could be a British shbip or entitled to the 'privileges and protection of a British ship, 'which was not owned exclusively by British subjects, 'which had notbeen built within the Queen's dominions, and of -which at least three-parts of the crew were not British subjects. Such was the only descrip,~tion of British ships )rnown to the Chines. Were you entitleid 'without consulIting them to alter the whole nature, charater, and effect of the treaty by passin- a law under 'which any Chinese subject, by a6 very aimpie process, could place himself entirely beyond the juirisdiction of his own Government. I Were you entitled to extend an engagement, already in its nature sufficiently onerous to the Chinese Governmient% in a manner 'which
shall show 'would have been fata to the power of China to enforce her own laws and maintain her own revenue? What is herul tat ouhav lid ow? A British consul

owned exclusively- by British subjects, published to Phe whole world thatthe system of the Hongkong Government is to authorize any owner, belonging to any country, to hoist tle British ensign and claim for his vessel the jrotection and privilege accorded to a Britshshipoutof thejutisdiction of nongkong, upon condition that he provided tha rtquisite security, and appied for a colonial register at Eiongkong. Under that system any Chinese subject, a pirate or a smuggler, might go to Hongkong and obtain a colonial licence, and then claim that his vessel sbould he exempted from the jurisdiction of the authorities of his own country, unless they went through the ceremony of first applying to the British Consul. Let us consider how such a systemwoould work nerorr home. Suppose it were established that any British smuggler, by renting a small piece of land at Boulogne or Calais, acquired the right to have his vessel registered as a French ship, and that when once so registered no British Custom-house officer should be entitled to go on board unless he obtained the preliminary sanction of the French Consul-suppose, further, the Thames snd the Mersey filUed with vessels of that description, .and I ask what chance we should bave of maintaining the security of our property or collecting our revenue? Yet that is the precise position of the Chinese. If you alter the plain proVsions of a treaty by a colonial ordinance, and allow vessels owned and manned by Chinese to defy the Chinese authorities in their own harbours, it is impossible for thelatter to have tbe least chance of putting down piracy and smug. gling. Accordingly we find that a large contraband trade in salt is carried on by Chinese vessels bearing coloraal regssters, and there i8 no doubt that the opium trade is to a great extent conducted in the same manner. So long ago as 1822 and 1823 this country entered into engagementswithChina to put down smugglin. I am afraid that those engagements have been a dead letter, and that, while we are punshing with such cruel severity a supposed infraction ox a treaty on the part of the Chinese, we on our part have pet a very lax interpretation upon our own obligations. (Hear, hear.) I am afraid that under anuy fair construction of the treaty the Arrow was not a Bxitish ship; and let me point out to your lordships that from first to last this is the argumient of Yeh. On the 14th of October he repeats that statement. He alwaYs returns to that point, and never admits that an infraction of the treaty had been committed. "The whole queston amounts to thi:-a lorcha built by Chinese purcased a British register, but that does not make her a British vessel." How does Sir John gowring, how do the British authorities meet this2 Is there any argument to prove that by paying two fees of 25 dollars each a Chinese vessel can purchase a register and then become a British sbip-any attempt to show that, according to a fair understanding of the treaty, this ship is to be considered as having been under British protection? Notbing of the kind. All that we find is a mere naked assertion, a blustering assertion, that she is a British ship, and that the Chinese must apologize. I say a blustering assertion, and unfortunately an assertion directly in the teeth not only of the truth, but of what Sir J. Bowring by his own showing knew at the time to be true, because the noble lord opposite (Earl Derby) has shown that before Le wrote thus to the Chinmese authorities he had written to Consul Parkes saying that this lorcha was not entitled to Britsh protection. (Hear, hear,) I cannot help thinling that this is a conclusive case upon the showing of my noble and learned frlend (the Lord ChanceUor) hiroself, who said that if therew as a flaw, if we were not entitled to demand redress our whole proceedings were erroneous. At the same time it is impossible to avoid some reference to these proceedings, and I am the more compe)led to allude to them because I heard with extreme pain from my noble friend the Secretary of State (Lord Clarendon) some rather incautious expressions, which seemed to give countenance to a doctrine which I have heard out of doors but which I never excpected to hear repeated, or even by implication sanctioned, intltis Housethe doctrine, Imean, that it does no,. much atter whether we were strictly i
the right or not in the original quarrel, if a colourable opportunity has been afforded for us to punish the habitual asolence of the Chinese and make them feel ourpower.
Earl GE ANVILLE.-That is far from being my recolection of the speech of my noble friend. (The Earl of Clarendon was at this moment absent from the House.)
Earl GREY.-I never stated that my noble friend had said this. I acquitted him of having in plain words put forward any SUCh monstrous doctrine; but I say that there were incautious phrases in his speech which gave more encouragement than I think ought to have been given by one standing in his position to an opinion which we have eeen stated in the pablic newspapers, and which we have heard outof doors. (Hear, hear.) Iappealtoyourlordshipe'whether suen opinions have not been expressed; whether you have not heard it said that the immediate subject of dispute does not much matter, " a rtpture"-and these words were used by my noble friend ((the Earl of Clarendon)-l"a nipture sooner or later was inevitable, and it has come." My noble friend said that in dealing with nations like the Chinete we must make thom sensible of thelaw of force, and appeal to them in the manner which alone they understaud. I do not think that is a correct doctrine. I believe -and that opinion is confirmed by these papers-that, instead of understanding only force, they are a nation very open to reason. Although inferior to onrselves in civilirateen, they are a nation among whom good government and good order were established ages before the nations of
urope emerged from barbarism. They are a people among whom the useful arts have made great progress, and who are singularly industrious and ingenious in their agriculture, With such a people our true policy is the policy of forbearance and conciliation. (Hear.) We might have hoped that by an extension of theirintercourse with Europeans, by gradu ally becoming more accustomed to our notions, aud by the influence o oEar relition, which is, I believe, likely to gain a footin g among them, they might be br,ught to treat us in a very different miner; and that the insolence and had feeling of which we complainwould in time give way under the influence of Christian teachin. There was good reason to hope that such a policy would be successfnl, because after the use of force was distinctly prohibited in 1847 we find that matters went on very well and very satisfactorily. I was much surprised to hear my noble friend the Secretary of State (Lord Clarendon) say that our relations with China were not amicable, and that for many years there had been no resident in Canton, official or non-officiai, who did not feel that the state of things there could not long continue. This seems to me to be very strange. I thought there was rather strong authority the other way, because when I turn to the papers I find that Sir John Bowring, writing to my nioble friend in 1852, while he was still restrained by those wise orders which be afterwards felt himself at liberty to disre. gard, said,-"'hMythreeyears'abode in the factories has made me tolerably well acquainted with the people. The authorities know that during the period of my residence in Canton there has been no interruption whatever of the public peace ; and I am not aware that a single complaint has ever been made of the mariner in which 7have administered justice as between my countrymen and the natives of China; nay, I have been called upon to settle, and have satisfactorily settled, questions among the Chinese themsolves, which they have referred to me for decision in preference totheir own mandarins. On my first reaching Canton many represeatations were made to me of the dangers I incurred by leaving the neighbourhood of the factories. I know lt was for some time the custom of the authorities to cause me to be followed by Government agents; but the practice has beenalontabandoned, and I have been in the habit of taking my walks in all directions within a circuit of 20 to 30 miles (avoiding entrance within the city gates), frequently alone, visiting and holding intercourse with the people, and,withoutthesmallest anxietyon iy part.ortheslightestincivilityorinterruptiononthepart ofthe natives." This was the state inwhichthings thenwere-trade going on perfectly smoothly without bitterness, all disputes easilysatisfied, and the Britishresidentsallowed towalkabout the country (against the express provisions of the treaty) free from incivility or insult, with the siogle exception that they are not to go within the city gates. My nDble friend stated that it was very important that there should be com. munications between the British and Chinese authorities - but these communications might take place without the city just as well as within it. If your lordships will refer to the papers, you will find that when Sir John Bowring applied ior an interview with Commissioner Yeh the commisioner wasready to meet him, but he appointed forthat purpose the house of the merchant Howqua, without the city. Sir John Bowring's disity would not allow him to submit to this and the interview did not take place solely because Sir John Bowring's dignity would not allow him to go anywhere but to theofficial residence of the commissioner. Therefore there is no object to be gained by enforcing a right of entrance into the city. On the other hand, you have to consider what have en the consequences of the collision which has taken place. The noble earl who introduced this notion very eloquently described the sufferings inflicted upon the Chinese ythe bombardment of their city and the destruction of life and property; bat I fear that the injury caused by the British troops is the smallest part of the calamity which has been inflicted upon them. It appears from these papers that in consequence of their being compelled to withdraw their troops to defend themselves the banditti have got the upper hand in the country districts, and a large part of China has been laid waste by them. My lords, can you contemplate without emotion these facts? You admit that the Chineose empire is only partially civilized and requires the restraints of law. You have dissolved the restraints of all law and subjected that great country to all the miseries of anarchy. It is impossible that can happen without your trade suffering. (Hear, hear.) We sball suffer not only In one of the most important
braneces of our trade, but also in an article which has become almost a necessary of life to the population and one of the main items of support to the revenue. But what we shall suffer ourselves is nothing as compared to the injur to the cause of humanity. My lords, 1 cannot contemplate without shuddering the amount of human suffering, misery, and distress which wll be created, and, as was eloquently stated by the noble earl opposite, not the least misebief wll be the fatal injury to religion. (Hear, hear). Can we suppose that the religion which we profess will find favour with the Chinesein consequence of onr proceedings? (Hear, hear.) An unjust war has been waged without the order of the British Government. It is the act of the British Plenipotentiary on the spot, contrary to the orders, as far as we know, given to him by the Government at home,. But Her Majesty's servants have advised her formallyto approve the acts of the Plenipotentiary. I cannot help believing that they have done so precipitately, and that further consideration would have induced them to condemn the proceedings which they have unfortunately approved. The papers byHerMajesty's commandhave been laid onyour lord. ships' ta le, and therefore, if you take no notice of them, by all the rules and practice of Parhament you mus be taken to give to them your tacit assent. By adopting the resolution which has been proposed by the noble earl opposite the Bouse wll relieve itself from any responsibility for the blood which has been shed, and, on the other hand, by rejecting that resolution you will deliberately Assume that responsibility collectively and individually. (Hear, hear) I understand, if not in this House, at least out of the House, it is said we are not to consider whether Sir 3. Bowrig hasb done riught or wrong, ht what on the whole under present circumstances is best for the publio
interest. I expet, if no other result, at least this good result fromthe adoption of the resolution-the instant recallo
Sir 3. Boing, the immnediate abandonment of the wickced atempt to coerce the Chinese, by the ix.
tremity of suffe ing, to submit to demands wvhich we had no right to make. (Cheers.) A grest wrotlg bas been committed. The British armns have been anployed in effecting the destruction, on insudficiebit grounds, of the lives and property of innocent people. The act has been approved by Hler Majesty's Government. Unless we express our dissent we must be taken also to approve it. It iS, then, a first duty, incumbent on us, to say we do not approve these inhuman proccedings. Viewving the question in that light, considering it as men and as Christiaus, believing tho holy precepts of religion are no less binding on nations than on individual-, can there be a doubt as to the vote we ought to give I, for nmy own part, entertain none, and I shall cordially support the rmotion of the noble earl. (Loud cheers.)
The Duke of ARGYLTL said, the debate had been conducted on technical and legal grounds, and it was said the defence of theGovernment must rest on grounds equally narrow and technical. It was his de4ire to prove that although they might descend to those grounds to meet their opponents they could challenge the decision of the Rouse on the broader considerations of right and jastice. The relations of the Chinese with all civilized nations were solely those of trade. In order to secure opportunities for the extension of our trade we obtained from the Chinese the cession of an important part of their territories, which was erected into the colony of Hongkong. It was notorious that the local trade on the coast of China could not be carried on at all if British vessels, in the sense of our navigation laws were exclmusively employed. It must be carried on chiefly in vessels manned by Chinese, but generally commanded by an Englishman or other foreigner. In special allusion to that necessity we had the supplemental treaty to which so much reference had been made. The noble earl who spoke last had referred to the 17th article of the supplemental treaty, which did not define what was a lorch*, and had argued that in the absence of any definition they must refer to the navigation laws which then existed. It was clear that a British lorch;, the expression used in the treaty, was an expression which the Chinese were capable of understanding. Was it possible to suppose that the Chinese would depend upon the navigation laws for a definition of a British lorcha ? It was, however, a mistake to suppose that the treaty did not define a British lorcha, for it was clear that by that term was meant a loroha having Bdtish papers, At the time the treaty was framed the practice of granting British papers to foreign vessels was somewhat lax, but the ordinance was intended not to foment smuggling or piracy, as the noble earl had suggested, but to enable the home Govern. ment to terminate the abuses which had hitherto prevailed, and certain restrictions were created. The noble earl had quoted a part of a despatch, in which it was stated that, according to the strict and technical meaning, of British vessels hardly ten could be found in the colony. It must be remembered that since the colony of Hongkong had been created great numbers had immigrated, and it was essential that those who took up their permanent residence there should be recognized. According to the ternis of the ordinance, Chinese who connected themselves with the colony of Hongkong by residence or property were entitled to receive British registers for vessels, provi-ed they were commanded by an Englishman, or one who understood the English language. flow could it be said that there was any intention by that ordinance to defraud the Chinese of any rghts, or that any of its provisions were unreasonable ? The noble earl (Grey) had fallen into a mistake in reference to what had fallen from the noble and learned lord on the woolsack, who had said that a British ship was protected if recognized by the Government and authorized to carry its flag. But, the noble earl had then asked if it was meant to say that any smuggler or pirate could enter the Canton river, and by hoisting the British flag prevent the authorities from seizing her? That was not the contention of the Government. The saine question arose in respect of the right of search, to which American vessels were not subiect. If a vessel carrying American colours was boarded, and she proved to be a bond fide American vessel, then the American Government had a ground of complaint. But if the vessel had no authority for hoisting that fiag, its mere presence would not prevent a seizure. In the case of the Arrow the vessel was no smuggler or pirate, but a vessel indisputably entitled under the ordinance to carry British colours.
The Earl of HARDWICKE.-.She had no papers.
The Duke of ARGYLL said, she had papers, but they were not on board. (A laugh.) If the Chinese authorities doubted her character, they should have applied to the consul, who possessed the papers, and could have convinced them upon that point. His Argument was that, supposing even there had been a doubt as to the legahty of the register of the Arrow, the Chineso had no right to board the vessel without first inquiring whether she was not a bond ffdc British lorcha within tho meaning of the supplemental treaty. He did not wish to enter upon a discussion as to the validity of the ordinance, hut he could not assent to the position laid down by the noble and learned lord (Lyndhurst), whioh appeared to be that the law of nations, while giving one Power any rights it pleased over its own subjects, did not confer any right to give rights to other subjects against their own natural Sovereign. Under the supplemental treaty one great object was to give such rights, and special mention was made of Chinese subjects against the claims of their natural Sovereign. Then came the question whether the Arrow was a British vesseL On faU consideration the Board of Trade came to the conclusion that it was never the intention of the Merchant Shipping Act to oyerrule the local prvileges necessary for the purposes of local trade, but that even if it had been so intended this ordinance havig been passed before that Act actually came into operation, it could not be held to contradict its provisions. The noble earl who spokelast had expressed astonishment that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should have quoted the case of the Mediterranean passes. Now, those passes had special reference to a local trade and to treaties concluded with the Barbary States; and this ordinance also referred to a locl trade in the waters of China and to a special treaty between this country and China. But the point was this.:-If the Chinese questioned the legality of our ordinance, they ought to have complained of it, and had no right to take the law into their own hands, The Alien Act passed in this country several years ago provided that Colonial Legislatures could confer on residents in our colonies not merely aU the privileges of British subjects, but any part of them; so that, though a vessel might not be naturalzed in regard to aU the rights of a British subject, the Legislature could bestow such portions of those rights as were necessary for local purposes. That Act, he tbought, would cover the ordinance of Hongkong. He had listened with great admiration to the saeech of the noble earl opposite (Derby); .but a large part of it consisted of an appeal to the feelings of the House, which was not justified nless he had previously made out his case on the grounds of law and argument. That, he contended, the noble earl had wholly failed to do. The doctrine was a sound one that the Government was bound by the acts of its agents, and he maintained that the conduct of those agents in this case had on the whole been nght. Sir J. Bowring might have attached an exaggerated imnportance to our entrance into Canton, but it was unfair to hold him responsible for the subsequent events, which were entirol:' attributable to the breach of faith committed by the Chsnese. On the other hand, when the rupture actuaUy occurred, it was only natural that Sir J. Bowring should have been anxious to secure the settlement of a long-pending question which threatened to prove a fertile source of future disputes. It woould certainly have been unjastifiable in our representative to pick a quarrel in order to bring about such a result; but the papers contained no indication of any such intention. Force had been resorted to in consequence of the wanton conduct of the ChinAse authorities, vwho, according to the substantial right and justice of the case, were therefore alone responsible for aU the bloodshed that had ensued.
The Earl of CARNARVON and the Bishop of OXFORD rose together, but the latter gave way, and the noble earl then moved the adjournment of the debate. (" Oh, oh !") It was now midnight, and even if the discussion were prolonged for a few hours more it could not be satibfactorily concluded without another sitting.
Earl GRA.VILLE trusted that the noble earl would not press his motion. (Hear, hear.) Considering the length of tme Dsually occupied by their debates did not exceed two hours and a half each evening, and that the other night a noble and loarned lord postponed a most valuable speech on an im-ortant subject because he declined to address benches that were nearly enipty, it was to be hoped, now thatthere was such a full attendance of their lordships, the House would not shrink from devoting more of its time to the discussion of a great question like the present. (Hear, hear.) That House had a high character for its debates, which was due, in some degree, to their eschewing the practice, followed elsewhere, of adjourning before their deliberations were concluded. This prevented the spirit of their debates from evaporating, and it also sustained that public interest which was apt to flag when people out of doors had to wade, day after day, through columns of protracted discussions. ("' Hear," and a laugh.) He trusted, therefore, that the Hlouse would adh re to precedent, and not grudge the sacrifice of a considerable portion of one night's rest in order to allow this question to be brought to a full issue. (Hear, hear.)
The Earl of DERBY quite agreed in the desirability on great occasions of securing a numerous attendance of peers, and he had regretted to witness the exceedingly small
number, on several instances, who took part in legislative affairs. He also admitted that they ought to show a readi-
ness to devote ample time to their discussions; but for that very reason it would be idle to prolong that important debate further into the night, inasmuch as if they sat two or even three hours more they could not well bring it to a close without an adjournment. Many noble lords capable and desirous of enilightening the House on the u,uestion before it had not yet spoken, and if 24 hours were given for reflection on their decision such an opportunity might, he ho ed, not bo without its effect upon the minds of many noble lords Two of his noble and learned friends, one of whom was anxious to address their lordships, had left the House in the full anticipation that the debate would extend to another night; and with a view, therefore, to afford ado-
nate time for a full discussion hehoped that the noble earl Uranville) would not resist the proposed adjournment. (Hear, hear," and cries of 1 Divide I")
Earl GRAINVILLE said he should be sorry to waste the time of the House by repeated divisions. (Hear, hear.)
Many of their lordships rose to leave the House, apparently under the belief that the Government had assented to the adjournment, but after a brief interval
Earl GRANVILLE rose and said he understood thatthe two noble and learned lords referred to by tho noble earl opposite as having gone away had "naired" before leaving.
The Earl of DERBY observed that that was quite true, but tbe pairs of the noble and learned lords applied only to that night, and would not prevent their speaking at another asiting. (Cries of " Divide.")
The Erl of HADWICCKE said there would be geat ditacul ty in resunmug the 4ehate, because he knew that,
many noble lords had left the House nn1tfr the IMpreWsor that the debate was adjorned. - (Hear, heal:.)
Earl GREY (who had just returned to his seat in Pe$e haste, in his greatcoat, and wbo spoke apparently very mute out of breath).-I caun confirm the statement just made br mynoble friend. I know that several noble lords bave lef the HoUSe, thinking that the debate was adjourned, ind I myself was just going out of the lobby under that impression. If my noble friendabove me (Earl Granvile)had divided on tne question of adjournment I was prepared o vote with h;m on the ground that the motion was made tooe ear7y, but now the question is very different, and after hiKnDg once agreed to an adjournment, I hope he wi not persist in proceeding with the debate.
Earl GRANVtLLE.-Earlyin theeveningmy noblefrlend opposite (Lord Derby) informed me that it was likely that & motion to adjourn the debate woould be made, and I thea stated to him my objections to an adjournment, though I said I should not go to a division on the point. When, therefore, the noble earl stated just now that two noble and learned lords had gone away under the impression that tho debate was to be adjourned, I at once acceded to the motion, but I was afterwards informed that they had not gone away without having first paired, and I am assured that no noble lords have gone away without taking that preeaution. That being the caso, I do not feel bound by the assent which I gave to the motion just now, and I shaU not agreer to lt without going to a division.
The Earl of DERBY.-I bops my noble friend will reconsider his decion. (Hear, hear.) In this Ilouse we hava always been accustomed on all sides of the House to hold' ourselves boand by an honourable understanding. My noble friend having told me that, though he had great objectione to the adjournment of the debate, he did not mean to divide the House on the question, I communicated that assurance to several noble friends of mine, and in consequence of it they went away. Under these circumstances I hope my noble friend will not insist on resuming the debate.
Earl GRANVILLE.-If the noble earl will assure met that any noble lords have left without pairing, in consequence of that understanding, I will agree to an adjournment.
The Earl of DERBY.-I am told that more than one of ny noble friends have left without pairing.
The Earl of HARDWICKE.-I think I may say that Lord Fitzwiliain hms gone away without pairing, understanding that the debate was to be adjourned, for he saic
to me as he went out, II Keep on dividing" (as we understood).
Earl GRA2SNILLE said he would not persist any longer his opositin to the motion, under those circumstancoe
The debate was then adjourned until Thursday, and the House rose shortly before 12 o'clock.

Mr. MACARTNEY wished to ask the Chief Commissioner of Workh whether there would be any objection to rebuild the wall lately puUed down in Grosvenor-place, so as to correspond with the portion standing next Constitution-hil, and placirg a railing thereon up to the doorway into the Park?
Sir B. HALL said, it was proposed to rebuild the wall as before. He had no objection that it should be rebuilt in the manner proposed, and he had told the gentlemen living opposite, who had addressed a representation to him, that if they chose to pay the additional exnenso he had no objection to thewall being rebuilt tii the w&y suggested.
LAND TRANSPORT CORPS.

INDIAN CIVIL SERVICE.
Mr. 9,EASY aaked the President of the Board of Control whetheri any reduction had taken place, or was contemplated, in the number of appointments in the civil service in India open to public competition ?
Mr. V. SMITH said there could not be any reduction, as a certain number of places were open to competition by Act of Parliament. If there happened to be fewer appointmnents, that circumstance was owing to accidental causes, such as fewer deaths occurring in the service.
MASTERS AND SERVANTS,
Mr. PELLATT asked the Attorney-General whether it was the intention of Her Majesty's Government to bring in a Bill to consolidate the statute laws relating to masters and servants, and to masters and workmen?
The ATTORNEY-GEN!ERAL replied that the statutes relating to masters and workmen had been consolidated for the Statute Law Commlissioners; and a Bill, which was under their consideration, embracing that consolidation would be brought into Parliament; but he was not aware of the intention of the Government to introduce any other measure on the subject.
SUITS AT LAW AND IN EQUITY.
Mr. J. G. PHILIJMORE asked the Attorney-General whether Her Majesty's Ministers would object to institute an inquiry (by a committee of this House or otherwise) into the means by w hich the distinction between suits at law and in equity, ahich had besn removed from the jurisprudence of the United States, might be abolished?
The ATTORNEY GENERAL said he should be excee 1- ingly glad to promote any inquiry likely to terminate in abolishing the technical distinction between suits at law and in equity, which he beheved would be the foundation stone of any effectual reform in our jurisprudence. It did not, however, appear, to the Government that zhat subject could be wel considered in a committee; and he trusted that when the department of public justice at present under the consideration of the Government (hear, hear) should be fotnded, it would form one of the matters of their deliberations.
BOARD OF HEALTH.
Mr. PALK asked the President of the Board of Health when he would bring on a Health of Towns Bill, and whether the BiU would carry out the recommendations of the Committee on the Board of Health ?
Mr. COWPER said he had already given notice of his intention to introduce a Bill to amend the Public Health Act. He thought he should bring it in on the 10th of March. The bill would be the same as that agreed to by the select committee, with various alterations which further consideation had suggested.
IRISH MILITIA.-MEDALS OF HONOUR.
Mr. ESMONDE asked the First Lord of the Treasury whbether it was the intention of Her Majesty's Government to call out for training the Irish Militi5 and, if so, at what period ? Also, when the issue of the Sardinian medals and the Order of the Medjidi6 might be expected?
Mr. PEEL said a portion of the Irish Militis would be assembled for exercise this year, and with respect to the medals he observed that the lists were being prepared, but were not quite completed.

ADJOURNMENT OF THBE HOUSE.
On the motion of Sir G. GREY, it was resolved that the House on its rising should adjourn until 2 o'clock tomorrow.
REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEMI.
Sir J. WALMSLEY rose to move for the appointment of a select committee to consider and report upon the most practical means of lessening the existing inequalities in our - represencative system, and for extending to the unenfran-
chised that share of political power to which they might be justly entitled. He assured the House he had no party or personal view in making the motion, being only actuated by an earnest desiro to ameliorate the political condition of that large portion of our fellow-countrymen who had been so long excluded from political rights, and who had shown themselves entitled to every consideration from the House by their loyalty and forbearance The only indication of any sympathy on the part of the Governnlent with Parliamentuy reform was the admisaion made by the noble lord at the head of the Government on a - roet occsaio'ad *at he had no objeciion to the reduction of
tlzqua ioeofor the county franchise from 50b to 201.; a ns itkeuiofst preeent to be impowible for him (SIr J. Wamse' i tomeeedin earrying any specfioc measur of p&riHeattry iitorm, ke would simply ask tho House to appoint a selecS tomMittee to considet and report upon the

sost practical means of dimiishing the inequalities in our vectoral system, and of qxtendlng to the unenfranchised Classes tbaM fair share of political Power to which they Vero entitled. Whatever diversity of opinion there maight be as to the poliy or impoUcy of auy pavticular meUsre.4 f reform, he apprehendeod tat there could be no doubt that some measure of that natare was necessary. All parties, ;n fact, admitted the necessity: and the question was one of detailratherthanofprinciple. It was dangerous to defer tleamendment of ourelectoral system. The legislation of that House was rapidly proaching a deadleck. At no period had the popular intelligence progreesed more rapidly than during the last few years. Every part of our social system had been Improved Rapid strides had been made in arts, science, commerce, an manufactures; but the political condition of the great mUSS of the people remained unimproved. (Hear, hear.) Authentic returns showed that out of a poplatieon of 28,000,000, containing 5,500,000 adults, ancd m a country 'which contained upwards of 4,000,000 of inhabited houses, we had only 1,000,00 of electors, and of even thoze a large number were prevented by bribery, intimidation, and other influences from exercising their electoral privileges in accordance with their convico tions.- It had been said that the mnenfranchi-ed portion of the people were indifferent to Parliamentary reform, but that assertion was founded on a misapprehension of their sentiments. No portion of the communty had made greater sacrifices than they to obtain political rights, and they would hail with enthusiasm any practical measure which would bring them within the electoral pale. There was undoubtedly a small portion of them who would be content with a mere redistribution of the members of that House among the population and the protection of the ballot; but those amendments would fail to remedy the existing evils. Some of the advocates of ParlHa. mentary reform complained that his^ motion was a yielding of the question. He certainly had no desire to yield it in any way, but be thought that at present it was impossible to obtain anything but a modicum or instalment of reform. There was a deep-seated con.iotion in the minds of the vast majority of the people that the restricted character of the franchise, the unequal distribution of members, the existence of several nomination boroughs, and the vant of protection to voters were the sources of mnany of our ecial and political evils. There was a great aristocratical preponderance not only in the Cabinet but in that House. Twelve of the 15 members of the Cabinet were either peers in their own right or the near relatives of peers, while 236 members of that House were either the sons, connexionsor nominees of peers. 'Unehalf of the members of the House were returned by about 180,000 of theelectors,whorepresentedpropertyworth about 7,000,0001., while the other half were returned by 800,000 electors,whorepresentedproperty to the valueof 77,OO,000GI There were about 10., ofthea ulationwhoseproperty was assessed at 42,000,0001., who h 144 representatives In that Hounse, wbile 8,000000 of the population, whose assessment was only 22,000,000., had 323 representatives; and when he compared the counties with each other he found that while one of them, whioh had a population of 2,000,060, with an assessment of 8,000,0001., had 14 representatives, another contiguous coanty, with a population of merely 163,000, and an assessment of 700,0001. had 11 representatives. Twenty-four counties or divisions of counties had 86 members more than they were entitled to with respect to other counties, and 10 coanties had 80 members less than their relative iro rtion.He might read to the Eouse many other tables illstrtive Of this subject but hethought it was suffilent to state the fact that although the populaton of the united kinom was 28,000,000, the number of electors was but 1,000, 000. Some persons were disposed to treat the franchise rather as a privego than a8 a right; in reply to them the hon. momber quoted the o?inions of Mr. Lke Sir W. Jones, Edmund Burke, Fox,' the Duke," ad of a noble lord who was now a member of that Houe in sup port of the proposition that all who paid taxes had a right to be represented, In the year 1839, and again in the years 1848, 1849, and 1850 the late Mr. Hume asked the House to adopt a Bill for the establishment of household suffrage, but his efforts were not successful. Subsequently tho noble lord the member for the city of London (Lord J. Russell) introduced a Bill by which he proposed to extend the franchise in counties to a 101., and in boroughs to a 61. asessment. That Bill proposed to make a great advance upon previous legislation. The noble lord's proposals to abolish certain nomination boroughs and to repeal the ratepaying clauses of the Reform Act were just and comprehensive; and in his (Sir J. WalmsleVs) opinion the country was deeply indebted to tne noble lord for his able and consistent efforts to ameliorate the political condition of the country. (Hear, hear.) At the same time he was constrained to say thWt the extension of the franchise contemplated by the noble lord's Bill was meagre in the extreme, and was not calculated to obtain for the measure, either in that House or eleewhere, the support necessary to procure the adoption of other portions of his proposals. A frnohise based upon assessment must alwaysbe unsaisfo tory. In the borough of Leicester there were 2,500 household voters and 1,500 freemen, the number of houses in the borough being 14,000, and the number of inhabitants60,0O0 or 70,000. A franchise founded upon a 61. assessment would have added only 610 householders; and, as by the same measure it was proposed to disfranchise the freemen, the constituency would, upon the whole, have been diminished by 900. If the qualification had been one of bond jide rent it would have added 4,000 voters to the list. It was said that it whs out of season to bring forward this question now; but he should like to ask when it would be in season ? The result of the debate the other night evinced no disposition on the part of the Government to bring in anotker Reform BilL It was due to the unenfranohised millions of this country, who paid more towards the public taxes i r
portion to their means than the classes above them, that the attempt should be made to bring them within the pale of theconstitution. Rewas told that he was yielding part of his demands by moving for a select committee ; but his object was, without abating one jot of his former opinions, to induce the House to make some progress on this great question. He was convinced that if the comnittee were granted it would be received as a great boon by the country. The hon. gentleman concluded by moving as above.
Mr. HADFIELD, in secondin the motion, said, that the hon. mover deserved the thanss of the country for bis perseverance on this subject. The time had arrived when a measure of reform should be passed, and it was to be hoped that ere long the pressure from without would force the Government to bring in a biUl worthy of general aceeptance. The aggregate constituency of the country, after allowing for double entries, was, at present, not more than 900,000 electors, out of a population of 28,000,000,-a disproportion that could not be justified on any principle of reason or equity. Every interest except the working eLasses, numbering about 5,000,000 persons, had its representatives in that HTouse, and, accordingly, advantage was taken of that circumstance the other ni&httopropose to relieve the enfranchised from 9,000,0001. of mcome-taxbyimposing 5,000,0001. of additional taxes on tea and sugar, the iiain burden of which would be thrown on the non-electors. In the borough of Sheffield there were 27,658 householders, whereas the total number of votess who polled at the last election, although there wvere four candidates, was only 4,034. The anxciety of the people to obtain the franchise ought to be encouraged in every way. Within the last 25 years they had improved in intelligence and independence, and they now might be called emphatically the strength of the country. The Hiouse of Commons would do its duty better if it were mounted on the broad shoulders of a widdy extended constituency, and its acts would command more general respect. (Hear.)
Sir G. STPRICKLA2ND said that though he was, perhaps, one of the oldest Reformers in the Hlouse, he could not give his support to the present motion, because it did not lay down any specific plan for remedying the anomalies and inequalities which the hon. member for Leicester had so ably pointed out. If it were carried, it would only delay, instead of hastening an extension of the suffrage ; and r rational extension of the suffrage he believed would be agreed to by most hon. members on both sides of the House. This motion was an exception to the rule, but, generally speaking, it had always struck him that fishing committees of this sort were intended to find brains for those who proposed them. (Laughter.) He had no fear of a wide extension of the suffrage being granted to the people, because, on the whole, they were the best instructed and most inteligent people in the world, and the most deserving of freedmn, and whatever privileges were granted to them they would be sure to make a good use of. (H}ear.) If, therefore, a clear and specific plau were brought forward for the gradual extension of the suffrage, it would have his support, but he could not support a vague, undefined proposal of this sort.
Mr. STAFFORD thought that the discrepancy between the three hon. gentlemen who had already addressed the House on this subject-the first of whom occupied the time of the House in criticizing ' the last Bill of the noble lord the member for London, while the second lamented that the constituency, himited as it was, only very partially availed itself of the privilege of voting, and the third, a veteran thick and thin Reformer, opposed the motion altogether on account of its vagueness-coupled with the great excitement which had been visible on the opposite benches during the addrosses of the. experienced Reformer who had introduced the subject (laughter), showed very clearly that this attack uon the institutions of the country .as destined to be a fa.'ure.( The hon. member for Leicester had been blamed for nots bringing forward a specific p an, hut he thought the hon. gentlemsan had done

opportunity than the present for appointing it. Of course the members who served on it ought to be men of impartial minds, who wo.ld keep their judgment in equilibrium, without feeling a bias either one way or the other ; and he could point out to the hon. member for Leicester several hon. and right hon.sgentlemen who would htust answer that description, and who would therefore make capital members of his committee-if he got it. When the House decided the other evening onthe specific plan of refom prbented to c them by the hon. member)for est Siury, 15 gentlemen who were members of the Government were absent from the diviion. Ifth committee were appointed itwouldhave powerto send for persons, papers, and records, and he presumed that the records for which the members sent would be their own speeches, the papers would be their election address, and the persons wouid be the constituents who had been simple enough to believe their professions. He would ask the hen. memberfor Leiceste rwhetherit was his intention toadivide
upon his miotion (Sir J. Walmsley, "q Certainly.d] Then he (Mr. Stafford) would suggest to the hon, gentleman that lhe would place some of his friends in a very awkward position, and might probably difranchise some of the constituencies which they now represented. The hon. member for Loicester was a comparatively oung Reformer, and veteran Reformers knew mauch bettor bowto deal with matters of this kind, for they were acquainted with circumstances which, doubtless, were not within. the knowledge of the hon. and innoosnt maember for Sheffie-ld.

support a Governmnent whi'ch was scarcely able to resist sucecessfully, without the aid of its opponents, such propontions as that now before the Hlouse.
M1r. T. flUNCOMBE said, it was not his province t) accunt for the absence of thos;e3members of the Gvernment to whom the hon. member for Nortamptonshire had referrdhi
from the division the other evening, but he nust say he thought they had fully done their dety last ndant by o assisting to piace the leader of the Opposition in a minority. (,"Hear, hear,' and a laugh.) It was not in his (Mr. Duncombe's) power to support the motion of his hon. friend, the member for Leirester. Nothing would afford him greater pleasure than to vote With that hon. gentleman, if he did not think that he would thereby rather damage than advance the cause of reform. He (Mfr. Duncombe) regretted , ost deeplytheo position which was offered the other evening by his noble rend at the bead of the Governmcent to the motion of the hon. member for East Sur
(Hear, hear.) He regarded that opposition as illtim2dyil advisear and mspet ungraious towards those who gaveothe noble nordts Administration a generous and independent support ; but if the noble lord were to adopt the saTe couhe to-night in resisting the motion of the hon. member for Leicester he (Mr. Duncombe) would think he was
acigwith great propriety. (A laugh.) Although he had ad the speech of the hon. member for Leieeoter, he could not for the life of him understand wfixt that hon, gentlemnan expected from a committee. Supposing the Hiouse to assent to the mnotion, he presumed the com-. mittee would he composed of hon. gentlemen from brthx sides of the House. The hon. member for Northampton. shire (Mr. Stafford) would probably be placed onthe comimittee, and, from what he had said to-night, would, no
doubt, afford them material assistance. (A laugh.) The first question that would arise would, probab'ly, be whether the committee was appointed to inquire into thienequalitles of the representative system in England, Wales, Scotland, or Ireland, for those countries were governed by three Beform Acts, which established different franchises. His hon. friend (Sir J. Wahnsley) would probably say, "Well, I never thought of that." iLaughter.) Some member of the committee might ask, ' Is reform necessary at all?" His hon. friend (Sir J. Walnsley) proposed, by his motion to extend " to the unenfranchised that share of political power to which they may be justly entitled." Why, what would become of the great principle of Reformers, that representation should be concurrent with taxation? Whb i not say the parties who "are" entitled, not who " may be
entitled. He (Mr. Duncombe) did not like such mawkish I language. (A laugh.) What vere the praetical means of
carrying out the scheme of the hon. member for Leicester 2 The hon. member for East Surrey (Hr. L King) proposed the other nightapractical means of gettingridof the Chandos clause-namely, by moving for leave to introduce a Bill. Some Reformers, and among others the late Mr. Hume, made a great mistake in voting for that clause. That hon. gentleman (Mr. Humne) supported it because he believed the admission to the franchise of 501. tenants-at-will would ultimately facilitate the adoption of the ballot. The conduct of Mr. Hiuae showed, however, the danger of votin for evil that good may come (a laugh), for now they coul not get rid of the Chandos clause, and they were about as far from obtaining the ballot as ever. (auglhter.) The ballot had been made an open question. But what was an open question, after all? It was a contrivance for the purpose of deluding constituents without advancing the cause. (Cheems.) The result was that although the hon. member for Bristol had carried his motion in favour of the ballot by frequQnt majorities, they were not a whit nearer the ballot than vhen the Reform BiUl passed. (Cheers and laughter from the Opposition.) He said that a great princdple was involved in this q;uestion of the representation, and he was not prepared to insult, in their just demands, the 4,500,000 of whom they had heard, by referring their claims to a commiUteo upstairs, as if it was a Rafiway Bill, or a Cemuetery Bill, or a Gas Bill. (EHear, hear.) No,-the question was too large not to be discussed irs the lght of day, and the more it was so discussed the greater would appear to be the title of the people te representation and enfranchisement. (Cheers.)
Mr. WAREPN.-I have only one word to say. Only think of referring the British Constitution to a select com, mittee ! I am so tickled with the idea that I have nothiDg else to say. (Cheers and laughter.)
3fr. W. J. FOX thought that a select committee was the readiest and fittest mode of bringing the question to a settlement, and he believed they might approximate to such an agreement as might be acted on. It could scarcely he denied that oUr representative system was characterized by eregious inequalities. Repressentative intitutions, from t eir very nature, required fuesuent alteration and development, and a representative Government. necessarily demanded from time to time extension and adjustment. Some places which were opulent and populous fell into poverty and decay, and others, from smanl beginnings, became great and influential. As education spread, too, a greater number of persons could be admitted with safety within the pale of the constitution. Unless changes of this kdnd were made, what happened ? Imperfect representation ws the parent of agitation. In a representative Government the people must either be ruled by an adjustment from time to time of the representative system, or they must be ruled in the very worst way, by successive yieldings to external agitation. (Cheers.) Manyof the great questions of modern times had been carried by agitation ; for example, the abolition of the slave trade, the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, Roman Catholis Emancipation, the Reform Act of 1832, and, lasUtly, the repeal of the Corn Laws, and the establishment ef free trade. Bnt these agitations involved a great expenditure of time and money; and the result of pursuing sach a course was that the people lost their confidence in those is whom it was desirable they should have the greatest confidence. OceaPion was Oiven for the rise of demagogues; and the people were initiated in the arts and tricks of faction. t had been objected that with regard to reform of the representation the people were in a state of apathy. Now, was this certainly the case? He believed that, although a desire for representative reform had not been demonstrated by monster meetings, there was a strong, 4eep, pervading feeling in favour of the desirableness and necessity for a change. (Hear.) He should support the motion.
Lord PALMERSTON.-One objection which is often made to those who propose a committee certainly cannot be made to the proposal of my hon. friend. It is often objected to those who propose a committee, that when they get their wish they re unable to bring the committee to any coneurrent opinion on the subject which they desire 'o submit to it; but if we are to judge from the suocees of my hon. friend in bringing the House to an almost unanimous opinion on the motion ho has made that objection certainly cannot be raised on the present occasion (laughter), for he has succeeded in ranging in wonderful unanimity of opinion on the same side those who are for a comprehensive reform, thoso who are for gradual reform, or what is called bit-bybit and step-by-step reform, and those who are opposed to reform in the abstract. (Laughter.) I would therefore submit to my hon. friend that he should be content with the achievement of this evening (" Hear, hear," and laughter), and not endeavour to prodrce a snmilar conearrence of opinion among the members of any committee that might be appointed in pursuanoe of hig motion. (Hear.) Bat Iam content to rest upon the arga ment, which I think is quite unanswerable, that has been urged against the proposal of this committee, that the matter is of too great importance, and one of too wide a range, and affecting too many raterial interests, to be'thrown loose upon the chance decision of a committee. (Hear.) It is one which those who may wish to bring it under the consideration of Parliament are bound to embody in the shape of some distinct proposal for which they are responsible. (Hear, hear.) Therefore, without stating the particular objections which I may feel to many of the abstract propo -itions of my hon. friend-without inquiring whether his proposal may ho founded on a right view of the British Constitution-without inquiring how far wem&y assumethat we sit here As delegates from Particular places rather than
B8 roPresentatives of the people at large-wvithout icquiring whether his priucples, if carried to their greatest extent, would or would not lead us to the arrangement of electoral districts-without, in short, stating the different objections which I might feel to much that he has
said, I think the House Will se' that the general concur-
rence of opinion is against the motion of my hon. frieadO. (Hear, hear.) Whether he wvll think it right to press his proposal to a division or not w ill depend on his own di - cretion, but I think the House will be of opinion that a com-
mittee is not a convenient mode of discussing a question of this kind, and is not the method which should be follows d by any person who wishes to introduce changes into tl e representative system of this country. (Hear, hear.)
Sir M. BERKELEY said, the Government were no doubt
obliged to the h on . member for forthamptconshire ( M. Stafford) for the very kind cotmselwhich he hadgiven them. He had a recommendation to give in return, He would advise thehon. gentleman to enter himself as a witness before this comwmittee,should it be appointed, as no doubt he would he able to give particular information on the subject of Government patronage. (" Hcar," and a laugh.)
Mr. L. KING wished to observe, that there was no precedent for a committee of inquiry on this question al d hoped that his hon, friend would not press his motion to a divison.

RAILWAY ACCIDENTS.
Mr. BENTINCK moved for the appointment of a select committee to inquire into the causes of accidents on railways, and into the possibility of removing any such causes by further legislation. The other night he was told, in answer to a question, that in conseqnenco of the diminution of accidents in proportion to the numbers of persons travelling by railway it was not intended by the '4overnment to bring in any measure for the p-evention of railway aceidents. -Now, it might be true that a very small number of accidents occurred in the course of railway travelling, and it might also be trae that the number of accidents were on ths decrease; still, if it could be shown that out of ten acoidents nine miRht be prevented by further legislation a very strong case for interference would be made out. He gave the gentlemen at the head of the greatrailwayconcerns credit for the sldllthey hadexhibieain their arrangements, and for the fullest disposition to adopt the most effective measres for the prevention of accidents, but it should be borne in mind that they were, to a certain degree, under the control of the shareholders, who did not like to increase expenses. His object in proposing the committee was to see whether any legislation could be recommended for the purpose of decreasing the number of accidents on railways.
Mr. HADFIELD believed that the number these of accidents was diminishing, and that every possible effort was being made by rail way directors to prevent them.
tMr. PALK thought it was greatly to be regretted that the Government haa not ears go interfered more actively in the management of railways, which were now almost the sole means of transit in this country. The Government might have saved the country those niUions of pounds which had been lost by tbe battles of the gauges, and have prevented those obstacles whioh now opposed travelling by railway in a straight direction. Upon many occasions it was much easier to go round by London than to attempt to o across the country by a shorter route. He approved the appointment of. the proposed committee, And hoped that the various railway companies would enter into some amicable arragements which would prevent those railway battles in which Parliament was so frequently asked to interfere.
Mr. HEYWORTH said it was to the interest of the shareholders to insist that all poesible efforts should be made to prevent accidents up;on their railways. If the hon. gentleman (Mr. Bentinck) could suggest any improvement in the man,agement of railways he believed that there was not a single railwray director in the kingdom who would not g,ladly attend to it. (Hear.). But the HIouse ought to be engaged upon more important maSters than the discussion of plans to prevent railway accidents.
Mr. WADDINGTON sup rted the motion, because It was very generally supposed that railway compamies vrere indifferent to the lives of the passengers committed to their care. RaiUway directora were not, as the hon. gentleman (tr. Bentinck) supposed, intent simply upon amassing large dividends for their shareholders. They were most anxious to preserve the lives of their passengers, and he believed that the result of the committee would be to prove that such was the fact. If, howKever, the appointment of the committee should be negatived, it woud be sup. posed, in the event of any lamentable railway accident, that it might have beni prevented if a committee of that House had inquired into this subject. The evidence that would be laid before the proposed committee would show that, while in some instanCes railways were parsimoniously managed, the great majority of railways were in the hands of directors whose liberality and asxiet for the lives of lIer Majsty's subjects Twere worthy of A praise; and it would DC shown that those who were parsimonious had adopted a false economy.
Mr. LO W-E said the Government had no objection whatever to the aopointment of this committee, and he hoped that the hoit. geatleman (Mr. Bentlnck) would be able to devise some plan whereby railway travelling miight be made aier. He, however, should not deal candidly with the House if he refrained from saying that the interference of any department of the Government in matters of this sort would not be attended with the good results which the hon. gentleman anticipated. He beheved that Lord Campbell's Act had been of great service to the country, because it made the interests of railway proprietors and of those who travelled upon their lines identical. He thought that rail. ways wfere at present managed in a compnaratively satisfactory manner, but he should be glad, indeedf, if the hon. gentlemnan should succeed in devcisig any plan for the more effectual prevention of the evils of wfhich he had com-
Mr. CROSSLEY suggested the adoption in this conntry of a practice which prevailed on the American railways-namely, that of placing a cord upon the tops of the carriages for the purpose of affording communication between the two ends of a train.
Mr. MILNES said that a cord for that pur ose ran along the bottoms of the carriages of the Great Northern
ilway, but it would be more than a passenger's life was worth to attempt to make use of it in case of an alrm of accident. Hetuonghtthatthe committee might be of great advantago if it continedI itself to listening to the sagestion of practical engineers, carefully avoiding to enterunto thes question as to the means by vwch Government could compel the prevention of tnese accidents.
MIr. BARNES approved the motion, because he believed that no persons were so much interested in an examination of the causes of railway accidenta as the proprietors of rail-
ay property.
Mr. T. EWART believed that railway directors were anxious to do everything in their power to add to the safety and comfort of their passengers, and that they would be flglad to receive any suggestions with that object. Every feasible
.for preventing acidents had been tried on the North-
Mr. ALCOCK thought the inquiry should extend to how far railway companies had in certian instances been guilty of a breach of faith with the public. When the railway from Reigate to Reading was proposed, U years ago, a promise was given that a jniction should be formed with the South.Western hne. That pledge had, however, never been redeemedl, and the Board of Trade was quite powerless to compel its fulfilment.
Mr. CAYLEY did not anticipate much good from the labours of the committee. It was noi, in the nature of things that they could travel at the pace of express trains with perfect security ; snd if the pubic insisted on extreme speed it must pay the penatly by incurrng some risk. The companies were sometimes rather harDy dealt with under Lord Campbell's Act, which inflictedvery heavy penalties on them for accidents due in some measure to the public taste for too rapid travelling.
gr. J. MrGREGOR thought that if the committee gave satisfaction to the public mind it would do no harm, and might be of some good. Trains were often despatched in suc'h qumck succession that the public must trust for its safety not so much to any communication between the passengers and the gard as to the enforcement of sound dscplie among their servants on the part of the railway companies.
Mr. PRICE hoped that the comrnittee would be fairly constituted.
Mr. PACKE beheved that the want of punctuality in the arrival And departure of trains at and from the different stations W45 a more fertile cause of accidents than even the rate at which they travelled; and he trusted that the committee would turn its attention to the correction of that irregularity.
Mr. BENTINCI hadnotdeemeditnecessary tostreogthen iS case by lengthened argument, because he understood the Government was not opposed to his motion. Smal es might be the number of railway accidents, they could be decreased by proper legislation-their two main causes being irregularity in the arrival and departure of trains and the shortness of the interval between the times of starting themn.
The motion was then agreed to.
CIVIL SERVICE EXAMINATIONS (IRELAND).
Ir. DEASY, in moving an address to the Crown for the assiilation of the mode of conducting the examinations for the Civil Service in Ireland to that adopted in London, said, he had no desire in any way to reflect on the persons who conducted these examinations in Ireland; his only complaint was, that an arrangement, which liad been ori.i. nally of a temporary nature only,hadbeen continued beyond the necessity of the case. In London, according to the last report of the Civil Service Commissioners, the examinations were conducted by two permanent and eight occasion sl examiners, and 12 other gentlemen had been employed for special purposes. In Ireland the examinations were all conducted under the superintendence of one examiner Dr. Robert Ball, a gentleman certainly of great attainnients and high respectability. Examination papers were sentfroui London, to which the candidates returnedwrijten answers, and these were then sent to London for the adjuldication of the commissioners, accompanied by a written report from Dr. Bail. It was not fair to the candidates, nor to Dr. Ball, that a duty of so delicate a natu,-
should be mntrusted to one person alone! and oth-r
examiners ought to be joined with him in -th task. There would be little difficulty in obtaining examiners of long experience and great scientifie attainments in Dablin. HIs wish was to supply to the Irish civil service the same machinery for conducting examinrtions as existed in London, and he hoped the Government would either assent to the motion or give such assurances as would prevent further discussion. The bon. and leared meznber concluded by moving that an humble address be uresented to Her Majesty prayin" that ahe will be gracionsy=plcaed to give directions to have the Civil Service examinations in Ireland conducted as in England, by examiners whose character, acquirements, and experienee in examinations render them peculiarly fitted for the duty.
Mr. NAPIER seconded the motion, and bore testimony to the great abities and resnectabilityof Dr. Ball. It would, however, be more satisfactory to all parties if the mode of conducting the examinations in England were adopted in Ireland. The great value of the system of competitivo examination consisted in the manner in which it was conducted, and, though it might be open to the disadvantage of. not always securing the man most fitted for the post stll it secured an educated man, and carried out the prin
ciple of merit being the only qualification for appoint -I ment. The system had a great effect in giving an impulso to education throughout the country, and he should be glad to see it still further extended.
The CHAfNCBLLOR of the EXCaEQUEJR said, the
hon, gentleman vwho brought forwarad he motion had
stated with perfect accuracy the mode in wrhich examiinations for admissino to the civil servlce were conducted in; Ireland. The examination papers were prenared by the commiEsioners in London; they were bent to [land, where the examination was conducte under the inspectiorn of a
local officer; and, after the examination was complete theI papers were coUected and returnea to the commissioners in

FRANKLIN EXPEDITION.
Mr. NPtIER rose to call the attention of the House to the commaunications with Her Majesty's Government respecting the Franklin expedition, and the urgent motive of the claim for a further and complete search. He hal been induced to bring forward this subject chiefly because
it was one of peculiar and pressing interest to morea than one of his constituents and friends, among whom he was proud to mention Captain Crozier, who WAS the personal friend and companion of Sir John Franklina In June last an important memorial was sent to the Go - vernment on this subject, signed by some of the miost em' nent scientific man of this country. He had kopod to the lat that a favourable answer would have been returned th that memoria considering that it related to a subject which affcted not merely the interests of science and humanity, but the honour and character of this country. It was not his wish to precipitate a hasty reslution regarding ip butt time presed, and it was important that if Anything was to be done it should be done quiclry. He was suro the noble lord at the head of the Government and the First Lord of the Admiralty both took a deep interest in this question,
pad he could not but think that some weighty reason must have prevented them giving a favourable answer to the memonal He might state that at the end of lat year there
was added to the memorial a letter from Baron Humboldto who gave the weight of his name and authority in favour of anew and thorough search. (Hear, hear.) What he wished
ularly to press on the Government was, that they now kews, f from the interesting communications of Dr pbae that the spot which it was important to search, and inB tI the memorials of our gallant ountrymen were foand, formied a very limited area, wer miapped and charted. When this providenti testimony reched.them, and when they weighed the attdidlity of some of. our galant country men being still inthat dreary re n, one would think that a speedy search woul ave enntttdi accordance with tho sprit and character and honour of England. (Hear, hear.) But the sympathies of the Government were absorbed by the war which then broke out, and the only thing done wasft institute an investigation through the medium of the Hudson's Bay Company, in order to obtain a corroboration of the factscommunicated by Dr. Rae. This was necessarily an imerfect and ineffective search, yet it served to ,ahow that the overnment wbre not disposed to rest satisfled with what Dr. ae hadl done. The reslt of this expedition was to bring to light other memorials, and to inregthen th1e hopethat, perhaps, some of the unfortunate
iduals begon g to Sir John Franklin's party were still strggling for existence. (Hear, har.) Who would be so presmptuous as to say that at this moment some of those men might not be in those lonely regions stll hoping that their brave and indomitable countrymeni at hxome had not forgotten them, but would persevere in carrying out mean
cures for their relief? (Heoar, hear.) He would noteinsult the noble lord at the head of the Government, or the First Lord of the Admiralty, by supposing that the akustion of expense would for a moment weigh with them if they saw it to be a matter of d aty to employ another exgedition. (Hear, hear.) lAdy Frardtin, with the true s cirit of a woman, was prepared to devote such prope as she
a search for her usband, but she knew weUthe difference between an he e on undertaken by a private individual and one tha wl carry with it the weight andteinfluence of the Government. She sent a touching letter to the noble lord at the head of the Government, and within a very few day-s afterwards the interestin circumstance took place of the American Government sending bacok the Resolute to this country. The galant captain who came over with that vessel volunteered his servies to accomipauy ani expedition to then Arctic reions. Should the sprit and enterprise of America agin lead to an expedition, and their sarch be attended withn the discovery of other moanorials, If nothing iore, what a se ta would it cast on the honour and character of this country ? (ERear, hear.) It should be remembered that one reward of these Arctic searches had beenL the discovery of the north-westpase by Captain M'Clure. It had bee prdicted in 1849 by o'ne, of the Lords of the Admirat tt sthe expeditionemhad
rished in Baffin's Bay, but it was next fouhnd that they 'sad winteredni Beechy Island four years afterwards. It was then said they could not have gone the way they did go, anda the predictions of the Arctic Committee were
falsified by the result. When Dr. Rai) was going~ on a geographical expedition he said in a letter wvritten in 1852 to The Timesthat there wasno chance of meetirng themissing crews. There was alimited auddefined area of 4deg.of latitude anad 5 deg. of longitude. Beechy Island and tbe month of the Fish River could be approached without great difficulty, andl between these two points, about 400 miles distant, lay the spot where the vessels and crews were about the year 1850. Should we leave these men undiscovered without searching that defined spot? Should we risk huaman life for war and for purposes of science, And leave 138 of our gallant countrymen, now that we had obtained some traces of them, without mak-ing one effort more ? Should we be deterred either by the expenise or the risk when there were gallant officers willing and anxious to go out, With regard to the risk, it was much diminished when the search was to be directed to a defined spot; and there waos, further, the assurance that within that region f urther memorials of Sir J. Franklin would be fouLnd. The evidence was conclusive that there must have been a considerable nuimber of the crew who made their way to the Fish River. If at the time of the last expedition we had not been engaged in war, and had sent out a properly equipped expeition2,nOoneocould tellwhat resultsmight not have b=e n acoplished. it had been proved that the north-wvest passage had been discovered by those gallat mnen inT working their way to the spot where their relies had been fouLnd. The Governmenit had an abundance of Arctic stores now lying useless ; they had vessls and crews; anad if the Government would consider the feelings of the relative of these imen, the claims of science, the demands of humanity, andl the touching appzeal mnade by Lady Franklin, lhe though~t they could hardly refuse to
sanction lthis expedition. In reading th e journal of
Captain CClne lie was struck by the mention I m aade of the labours of the Mogravian missionary who accom-
panied his expedition; and perhaps one result of sending
out another expedition would be that these frozen regions , wouldbeopened ten cv cilization and Christianity He would
now move, for form's sake, for a copy of the correspondence conctnedcwthd wthi sbet.i ujc
Captaii SCOBELL thanked the right hon. and learned
gentleman for calling tbe attention of the House aad the
Government to thi s subiect. (Hear.) He knew Franklin I so nd Parry, and he had had conversations with many recent Arctic voyagers. He was amember of the Arctic Committee,
at,d had heard and rend every thing that had been said and i publish ed on this subject for the last 20 yer.H knew
there vas a responsibility in sending out men upon another
oxpedition, because accidents might happsen, hu,t some onel must take the responsihility and risk It should, howevrer,
be remembered that the Government need not ask auyy one t o wo was no ' a voluneer. Plenty of sailors inigt be got, and the Government could obtain a dozen com-
petent officers to volunteer for another x xpedition. A A prrssent the risk was nothing compared with i that of the
previous expeditions. sinceforiner trvellers had to penetrate flr(m Beechy Island and to xope their way as tthoy could along the whole north-western pasage. If the Governm ment, howver, deteerined to emnd snother expedition,
there was not a day or an hour to belost. Two expeditions j Ouaght to be sent-one by xe and one by land. He would. send two small vessels, and his belief wao, that if the expedition were Perfectly equipPed and immediately deapp.tched, even, if Franlldi and his crew werp Not found alive, there would at least be- found records and, relies -that would, be gratifying to the 6ountry. If it were only to instil h future times into the ininds Of -Caen, engaged in the aeXviceof tho eountrythatnotbiug.
whatever would n be left undone to insure thelr safety, he.
*ho gave theilr voloe in favour of one more final attempt, not from a love of tAdventue, Of which they Ead already had eno0ug, Aor from a love of fame, of whicsh, too,*they.had haa enough, but because they believed that if a farther Uarclt were tot made the Government and the meopleo f thin country would fail in their duty.
Mr. I'ISIDE allowed that the Admiralty ha not 1beeninattentive to the supposed fate of Sir John Fnklin .and lz companiomn, and that a great deal of money had been spent in sending out expeditions to discover traces of thnn t but the First Lord of the Admiralty, who had advanced this as an argument against sending out any farther xpedition, seemed to forget that the former expeditions had greatly lessened the labour and diminished the risk of any ,which might follow hereafter. {Hear, hear.) Sir Robert hl'Clure had been four years in the snow when he quittod hbis alf, and had he not been obliged to obey orders he woulda ave been very glad to remain another year. The 'Government. would have plenty of volunteers if they would ttake the matter in hand. He did not understand the First Lord of the Admiralty to say that he had submitted the queation to the eminent men who had prosecuted former Arctic searches, and that it was upon their advice that he had refused to send out another expedition, and until he heard that that was the case he should prefer to take the opiion.of the eminent men who had signed the dooument so oftenzeferred to before that of the nght hon. gentleman. The American traveler, Dr. Kane, not only expresscd his belief that he believed some of the men belonging to Franklin's ex-pedition might he foundamong the Esqui. maux, but said he should be glad to live with them himself (a laugh), and he very amusingly described the difficulty which ehadtopreventhissilorstalingtoalifeamongthe Esqumaux If he overmentdidnot take the matter tn,ad ts ticod oteonsoeasily or s effciently as under Government su;eerintendence.
Adirl EREBLEY admitted that many officers who had been in the Arctic regions and many also who had not been here were ranious to go on another search ; but having conversed withmoet of the officers who had been engaged in previous reearehes ke could assure the House t hough a tew might believe that some of Franklin's people mit
be in existence byr far the greater parct, he~ might sPa[ye alm1osi1 all, were of opinion that they were not nm existence. The Vt08ost that we could hope for would be the poor satis. faction of discovering where their remains were. The right hon. ucd learned gentleman opposite seemed to think~ tPIt there would not be the sligbtest risk in sending a sthi to Beechey Island, but ipne ship belon ing to thelast expeds
ion, whiCh had heen sent out in 1853, had been lost in going
out to Beechey Island, which was the utmost limit of the expedition ; and the other ship, the Phcenix, under the coinhmand of Captain Inglefield, a skuland courageous officer, hadbeentwicein the greatestidanger Hehadgiven much con. sideatin tothesubect,andthogh it was with pain thai he had ceme to the conclusion, he did not dare to undertake the responsibMlsty of advising the Government to send oul another expedition. It was a most unpleasant duty to have to restrain the courage of officers and men, but it was a duty sometinmes to prevent courage deviating into rashness.
Mr. W. J. FOX said, the question was not whether the Oc-ernnent would undertake the respoonsibility of sending out another expedition, but whether they would demur to receive and act upon the recommendation of the House to that effect. The risk and the danger, supposing the plan suagested were adopted, had been greatly overrated, and sufficient consideration had not been given to the limited . area over which the search would have to be prosecuted. It was impossible to suppose that the Erebus and Terror could havedisapeared from the face of the earth without leaving a trace behind. Indeed, we had negative evidence to show' that they had not been destroyed by some sudden catastrophe. Ko doubt a considerable change had lately taken place in public opuon on the subject. le himself was conscious of sucs achange. Some time ago he had been of opinion that the time had gone by for any further search, but that impression had been materially changed within a short *time by varous considerations which had been put forward. He now entertamed hope that some of Franklin's companions might yet be living among the Esquimaux. t mwas possible that some traces of the expedition might be discovered among the Esquimaux, but he thought it was at least due to the memory of the gallant men under Franklin's command that some endeavour should be made to ascertain their fate. The interest on this subject was not confined to literary men, or to persons interested in science and the. general Progreis of discovery; but he believed that it would afford high gratification to the great mass of the people of this country if the Government made another . attempt, if not to save the lives of Sir J. Franklin and his brave conpanions, at least to learn something of their discoveriee, their sufferings, and their heroism.
Mr. E. DENISON thought the decision of Her Majesty's Government was founded upon justice and wisdom. It had been said by one hon. gentleman that the great Americau community, and the civilized world generally, expected that another effort should be made to ascertain the fate of Sir J. Franklin; but he (Mr. Denison) believed it was the opinion of the great mass of the English people that enough, if not more thani enough, had been already done. Another hon. gentleman had suggested that, in order to free themselves
rom responsibility, the Government should lend two shins
and that the means for the expedition should be Drovided from private sources; but he (Mr. Denison) thought the Government ought not, upon a question of this magnitude and importance, to seek to escape from responsibility* and he did not think they would avoid such responsibility if they * let sbies in which the lives of brave and galant men were
to be rnked. He considered that the Government had arnved at a correct conclusion and that the country would concur in the propriety of their decision.
Mr. NAPIER deeply regretted the conclusion at which Her Majesty's Government had arrived on this subject. (Hear, lear.) Fie bad been in comwunication with Lady Franklin. and he thought she had been somewhat hardly treated, for at the end of the last session the Government had prontised to consider during the recess the pro riety of sendimg out another expedition, and he had felt a -sffloulty in bringing the subject under the attention of the House untl their decision was announced. He trusted that if a private expedition should be sent out the Government would -not refuse their assistance to the entent of supplying stores and other requisites. He would not press the motion, but he would consult with some of his friends as to the course which it might be deemed advisable to adopt.
Colonel FREESTUN observed that Sir G. Back, who was a most gallant and humane officer, had told him that he did not think the advantages of sending out Another expedition in search of Sir J. Franklin 'would b eat all commensurato witha the risk.
The motion was theii by leave withdrawn.
SWANSEA. CEMETERY.
Mr. DILL'WYN moved for an address for a copy of any correspondence with the Secretary of State for the Home Department as to the refusal of the Bishop of the diocess to consecrate the new cemetery for the borough of Swansea without provision being made by the burial board for the conveyance to and from the cemetery of the officiating clergymaLn.
Mr. MASSEY had no objection to the production of the papers, but he maght observe that the bish op had by law a discretionary power as to the approval of burying-grounds, and that the Government hbad no right to interfere.
MIr. MIILNES thought that it would have been better it thi qustin hd benbroghtforardin heHouse of Lords, wvhere the bishop of rthe hdiocesar wold thave hads an opportunity of answering for himself.
Alter a few words fromu Mr. W. J. Fox, The motion was agreed to.

SAVYNGS-BA-ES.
The CayANCELLOR Of the EXCHEQUER said that in the then thlinly attended sitate of the benches it would not be necessary for hinytomen ter into a lengthenedstatement of the measure which he proposed to bring in to alter the is

Ho might mnention the rec-ent case of the Bromley Sa-vings-bank, 'where the dlefalcations amounted to 1,0001. while the bond given by the actuary 'was only for 50I., the consequence being that the depositors 'were exposed to severe loss.

Sir H. WVILLOUGHBY wished to remind the Hou,e that the saivings-bank money afmounted to 36,000,0001., and that if the stock were sold atyresent prices a loss of 5,M0,001. would be the result. The Chancellor of the Excheqer had the Power to do what he pleased w-ith that stock He coulua go inIto the stock.market whenever he pleased, and he might become, if he chose, the greatest stock-lobber in the world. The la noiai pae h power of dealing with thi stc nte hands of certain persons holding high offices, such as the Speakero eH

A. mnore eaingerous and unconstitutional power was never exercised by any3Minister, and he hoPed that the Huse, now that the question ws before it, would take care that this vast power wax placed ina proper hands, and regulxte by proper enactmsint#.
Mr. GROGAN was glad that the Chancellor of the Enx_ cheilsez had taken npt ths quegtion, and had no doubt that his iHiv ould be highl acceptable to the oeuntry.

They had traces of them bly the three vrAves found on Beechey I samd in the year, he thought, o 1846. Thenceforwards no tidings wore obtined, until Dr. 4a, in the year 185, learned from the Esquiasux that in the year 185I44 white men had been seen on King Willim's Lsfnd,and theromains of 30 at the mouth of Back River, and those of fivemore6at Montreal Island, and that gentleman brought hone-aeveral relics of Sir John FrAnklin and hig part?r, dularly a badge of the Guelphic Order.

se a b r a n d in tr e p i d , sa d a n dth e r u b duediti n (H e a r , Sir 0. WOOD was ga that the hon. and gallant a4mWral had spoken before him, for In almost every word tIsa fell from him he entirely concurred, and he was glad to havye the gallant Offiooers authority In confirmation of his own opinion that we should but be exposing to unnece~arLy risk the live of our gallant somoen by sending out another expedition. (Hoar, hear.) The Govere nent were not in. sensible to the" aPPeal very naturally made by Lady Fraukl1n for Puring the search to the utmost poesible lmits, or to the appeAl of thos scientific bodies who had addressed the Government in favour of a further sfearh. Nr wofald tha
Government be insensible to the appeals made on the score of humanity if thoy entertained the slightest hope that by senaing out another expeaition survivor, might be found and their lives preserved. (Hear.) Wana such hope existed no tisk or expoense had deterred stuccesdve Governments from sending oDt expeditions in search of fSir John Franelin and is companions; and at the same time he was happy to bear testimnony to ths gallant fheeng whicha aninated our transatlantic brethren in sendig out epeditions with that object. (Hear, heaLr) But )it the youae consider what ha been done. It was now 12 yeo syice Sir John Frankl's expedition left England, cud since then at lat a many expeditions hTA been sent orut, and, though it was quite true that no one grudged the money, whie a hoqe of saving life existed, yet there bad been expended in public expeditionn, independent private expedb tions, and those sent by America not less than 610,t Ct. However, it was not the expense which deterred the Gove rment from sending out another expe. aition; but, believing that there was no hope of finding any survivor of Sir John Franklin's fatal expdiftion, the
did not feel justified in exposing to the risks inseparable from such explorations the lives of further officers aind men (hear, hear) though he hald not the sightest hestatio in saying t6at, to the honour of our gallant navy, volunteers would be found, both officers and men, sufficientt for-20 expeditions. (Hear, hear.) The Goverimend had in bany respects amod painful duty to perform, but he did not think that any reasonable person entertained the expectation that any of the men of Slr John Franklins expedition could be found alive. (Hear, hear.) They left tbe country 12 years ago; and, taking the accolnt which Dr. Ae gave, tho last tidings of them were thAt in 1I5 a party of 30 or 40 were seen passing over King Wirty! sland, near the month of the Great Fish River, and they must have "perished in that year. Ho was afraid that thet esu rvivor of the expedition pihed in 1850. No officers whith whom he (Sir C. Wood) haod conversed upon the subject bad ventured to say that the last of the rewt lived beyond that year, however anxious some of those officers 'were to take p art in another expedition. The right hon. gentleman (Mr. Napier) was a lawy erand he would know what weight was tD ha attched to a decision in a court of law upon evidence. Now, this very question of the iprobability of any of the crew In the expedition of Sir John F kion ben g neow alive had been argued in the Court of Sesson in Scotland, and that Court, after considering all the best evidence that could be adduced, decided that every person in that expedition must have perished so far back as the year 185. (Hear.) The right hion. gentleman had said that the ame to be visied was imited and mapped and charted, but however limited it might be it was not imapped and cbarte4, and yet, as it was supposed that Sir John Franklin's expedition perished'there, it would be necessary for any new expedition that miiht be sent out to obtain information about him to run the very same risks which he ran. The right hon. gentleman had assumed that all the ships beloning to the FrankGn expedition hadeither perishfed or had baen abandoned. If they had perished, the probablity was that all on bear had plrished with them. If, however, they had been voluntarily abandoned itwas not probable that those who abandoned them would leave on board that whieh was the most valuable part of their poperty, namely, those journals and records which it was toeir speciralduty tomakeandkeep. He (Sir C. Wood) therefore did not think that any new expedition ought o lbe sent out, on the ground that at least the journals or logs of the Franklin expedition might be obtained. If the last survivor took those records with hin, but was prevented froni removing to any great ditance from the spot where it was supposed the ex dition foundered it was not likely that before his deatlhvi had deposited item in a plaea which he had deliberately selected as that which was best calculated to enable any other person to discover them. The po rspect, therefore, of any new expedition being able to dscover any seientific records of the Franklin expedition Was soCslight that he (Sir 0. Wood) did not think that a nEw expedition ought to be risked, and as to discovering any of the men alive he beieved there was no prospect whatever. Sone more relies of the ships, such as pieces of wood and iron, oars of the boats, or things of thatkind might be discovered, of which we had already an abundance; t it was very doubtful whether even any more of such relies could be met with. Would the Government, then, be justified under such circumstances in risklng toe lives of 150 men in a niew expedition? (Hear, hear.) He quite agreed with his hon. aLnd gallant friend (Captain Scobell), that if another expedfition were determined upon, two ships at least should be set out, and that the expedition should furnished with the means of landing andtof pwing at least two winters on the spot; but he really believedr that it would not be worth while to risk any senchu edition. His hon, and gallant friend had ppaled to the oversnment to send out another andfinal expe tion;butitmightbothatthatexpeditionwoumd
aeet with the samefate as the Frankline=pedition, and then erewould havetobe renowed expeditions without end to discover the survivors, in ordernthat such peeplemas those to whom his hen. and gallant friend had alluded, natmely, those who supposed that a portion of the Franklin expedition might be living, for the next 10 or 20 years might begratified, But the lapse of time since that expeditin sailed was so great that he (Sir C. Wood) believed ther wa% no possi'bility of there now being a survvor. He regretted at the time-when the Franklin expedition was determined upon that the Govemnment should have consented to risk si much for so little as the mere discovery of what was called the North-West Passage. [le was most unwilling to incuLr any fresh responsibility with regard to that expedition, and was obliged to say that Her Majesty's Govemnment could not give any encouragement to the propasal to send out another expedition.
Mdr. LIMTSAY had learned from experiencedl Arctic officers that there was not only much to be gained in a ecientifiepointof viewfromn another expedition,but thatt-here was a hope that some maembers of Sir J. Franklin's party were st ialive. The enterprise originally underbaken for the discovery of a north-west passage mnight have been one of doubtful advantage ; but when we had spent 610,000!. upo't, and had sent out lar. e e dition to vast tracts of0ocea and of territory, whicl hea iow besen nll explored, excetingver smal spce,in wichit was not so very
impobbl tht om o Frnkins prt mgh stliur{v
ressels now lying idle, and, if they declined to authorize a further search on their own responsibility, they Ehould at least place at the disposal of private individuals two of 'hose vessels, and a suitable portion of their remaining Arcti
stores,-in which case the necessary funds for sending fotth the expedition would no donbt be at onre raised. Tho
earch must be made now or be left alone for over.
MJr. K 3ILNES did not think the country would accep' Ls final the decision of the First Lord of the Admiralty. A great problem in geographical science had been solved by hbe Arctic expeditions; and, with the exception of the deplorable loss of the Erebus and Terror, those expeditions ha been attended with a smaller sacrifice of life than often iccurred on other stations where our ships were doomed to inglorious inactivity. This was a question on which landsnoe must, after all, rely on the judgment of nautical ofMi.ers, and certainly the weight of authority seemed enormously in favour of a further search. The First Lord of the A miralty said, that nobody whose opnion was de3ervrng of weight believed that any of Sir J. Franklin's party stUl survived. Was the right hon. gentlenan unaware tbat Dr. Kane Sir George Beaufort (ate Hydrographer to the Admiralty) and Captain Sherard Osborn, entertained a belef that some of them moight be yet alivo ? The inteiest felt by the countq in this mxatter was a growing One; anda i the present tioverument abandoned it, it wpuld force itself upon the attention of their successors. LadXFranklin was a woman not easily to be baffedin scha c -e.: She had set her heart and her f6rtune on what rbe deemed a greatduty, and one way or another she would acco6nplish t., The public would rally round ler, and an exteditlon wou1d lie ltted out, The consrgning of the Iteeolut to lie upJn erdintry as adismantleahulk could hardliUbeXegarded as an act of courte by the Amzericn Goeerntnent. 4 letter appreciation might have been shown of the badorcno upirit in which tbh.t vessel wa presente&tX this ceuntrZr by cur trajisatlantie kinsfolk.

cied the controlling power. It was true that the commissioners in whom the admiinistration of the funds of the savings banks was vest never looked into it, the real -autherity beino entred in the Controler-General, Sir A. Tpearnan, unaer the general superintendence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It n ight be desirable-he did not deny mt-to mnake some alt-eration, in that administration, but he begged leave to remark that he considered the Gvernment fairly entitiled, being subject ty the losses that arse from the vation in the funds, to mlak the best use they could of the savings-banks money by the transfer of securitie when it was morebeneficialto invest in Exchelhertbills rather than in Consols, and r ae verd. The sencuties at present held by the Commissioners of Savings-banks wer to the amount of 25,958,M in s per cent. atocki, of 5,480,0001. in Exchequer-bills, and of 1,765,0001. in Exchequer-bonds. He would now answer a questionput to him by the hond baronet some nights ago with respect to the Exchequer-bonds held by the Coinqsatoners for the oeduction of the National Debt. The Commissonens for the Eeduction of the National Debt held 1,765,000M. Exchequer-bonds on account of savin
banks. Their purchases were all made from the Bank, to whom they were issed, in order to puas them on to the commissione-rs. They were authorized to purchase this security by the Acts under which the bonds were isued. The purchase originally extended to o,f50,000l; but they sold 85,0001. to the Patriotic Fund, which reduced the amouty to 1,765,0001. The remainder of the 2,000,00sc.- vin, 2e5,000rb-was held by the Patriotic Fund. The iuchases were made between August, 1854, and the l.t) of January, 1855. The money for the purchase was provided partly by the sus received from Echtequer-bills vhe the commissioners, and 'which 'vere f aid off and cancelled, paTtly froCa cash balsnce Eising from dividends, and partly from sales of stock. For many years the savings-nks had been recognized as forming a desirable s bject for legislation, and though he did not flatter himself that he had produced a measure free from all objection in endeavouring to reconcile the claims of the local management with the necessity of taing adequate security for the Government, he nevertheles hoped with some confidence that the conditions be proposed would be found safe and moderate. He hoed the House would examine the bil with indrugentc bei conscious of the real difficulties which th the subject and of the losiss enta seed on poor depe-i tors, when the lamentable event occurred of a failur.~ through the fraud of a local officer, and it turned out, contrary to their expectations, that they possessed no security, and were thereby exposed to moat distressing and painful consequence. (Hoar, hear.)
Sir H. WILLOUGHBY was glad to hear that the Chanellor of the Exchequer thought that the administration of the savings banks funds ought to be considered. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had the important power under the Act of creating new stock. HeI thought that the Government, in varying their surities, exercised an exorbitant and monstrous power.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER-I cannot admit that the power of varying Government securities is exorbitant and monstrous. The hon. baronet speaks as if the conversion of Exchequer-bils into Consols implied some excessive power on the part of the Government, but Exahether-biUs are just as complete and valid Government sepostio as Tpree per Cent. Consls. It is not as ff the Government had the yowver of creating debt. They muerely vary the security or which the debt conspeI nstead of it being a debt in the fori of Exchequer-bills, it becomes, by the

Colonel DUNNE thanked the Chancellor of the Excheqner for his proposition, which, if it should become law, wouhl be of grent service to Ireland.
Mr. WILKINSON asked whether the Government intended to give relief to those who had already suLffered from the failure of savings-banks ?
Mr. BARROW was glad to hear that the right hon. gentleman did not intendI to make any alteration in the rate of interest ; and hoped that that local mnanagement of savings-beanks wvhich had given so mnuch satisfaction to depositors would not be interfered with.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHIEQUER said that the Bill which ho intended to bring in would secure deo-e aitors popectively, uponx certain conditions being complied with, but it would not have a retrospective operation.
The resoluition was then agreed to, and the House resumed.

The resolutions on the Chinese question were
The resolutions on the Chinese question were introduced last night by Lord DZRBY with a felicity to which the public is no stranger. The British representatives in the Eastern Seas and the Britisn Government at home have had to support an onslaught which might inculcate caution on any set of functionaries. Since the days of the French philosophers the Chinese have never received so many compliments as were crowded into Lord DERBY'S speech last night. The virtuous, contented people-their amiable and instiucted rulers, learned in all the sententious wisdom of many thousand years, are contrasted with the greedy traders and vain officials who are established on their coasts. What an able advocate can effect may be well understood from the fact that Lord DaBBY wvas able to represent an English Plenipotentiaxy and Adcmiral as intent on forcing an entry into an unwilling city, and using, first menace, and then violence, in a discussion in which they were only met by courtesy and sound argument. The right of the lorcha Arrow to bear the British flag ancd avail itself of the Hongkong register seems to be a minor question in his mind. The far greater one, whether European nations shall assert their inherent rights to be treated with justice and on fair terms of equality, he considers and decides in the negative. Adopting for the occasion the ma2xim that the popular will is the true test of right, he declares his conviction that the inhabitants of Canton are to be excused for excluding foreign nations from entrance into their city, and that Commissioner Ysa did no more than his duty in adopting this popular vote as a ground for refusing, not only the admission of any body of Englishmen, but even the privilege of an interview to Sir Jo1N BOWRING. Into the details respecting the legal rights of the Arrow it is unnecessary to follow Lord DEnBy; it is sufficient to say that the truth of the case, as often given in these columns, was amply substantiated in the reply of Lord CL&AiuNDON. We may, however, once more recount the chief incidents of the dispute. The pith of Lord DERBY'S resolutions consists in the implied argument that, though the stipulations of treaty may have been broken by the Chinese in the matter of the lorcha, it was unwise to add to this embroilment that connected with our admission into Canton, and unnecessary in either case to push affairs to the issue of actual hostilities. We do not think that any one of the asaumptions herein comprised can be substantiated by the evidence which the publication of official papers and the reports from the spot have placed in the possession of the public. About the nationality of the Arrow we need not add a word. It is clear that none of the doubts suggested on this point can exculpate either the attack of the Chinese upon the vessel or the conduct of YEn in defending it. The points really important, from Lord DERBY's view of the case, are simply these :-Was the original outrage of a character to call imperatively for redress ? Was the redress demanded excessive ? Was it substantially refused, and, when refused, did it become incumbent on our authorities to resort to force, or might the matter have been left in suspense, at all events, until the receipt of instructions from home? Finally, was the particular demand which the Chinese were most likely to stumble at introduced in such a manner or at such a stage aa to impede what might otherwise have been a settlement of the affair ? These several questions shall be plainly considered, and -we beg the reader's especial attention to the dates as well as the facts involved.
It was on the 8th of October that the Chinegs officials boarded a veuel under British colours and carried off 12 out of 14 of her crew. Against such contingencies precautions had been taken by the direct terms of a treaty, which expressly provided that alleged delinkquents of either nation, being on the ships or ternr-
tory of the other, should be demanded through the authorities of that nation iunder whose jurisdiction they stood for the moment, the importance of the point consistiug not only in the general propriety of preserving such conditions of intercourse, but in the necessity of protecting the peculiar trade of Etongkong. It wil hardly, therefore, be argued that Consul PARES, when apprised of the outrage, could have left it unnoticed; but did he notice it too severely, or with extravagant demands? Here follow the very words of his first address to YxSE:"I therefore request your Excellency to direct "that the men who have been carried away from "the Arrow be returned by the captain (i. e., the "officer who had seized them), LEAN-KWO-TIIa, to "that vessel in my presence." This is literally all that was asked of the Chinese Commissioner, and this simple act of restitution would have satisfied our Consul and concluded the affair. As additional inducements, both in the way of invitation and warning, Consul PARIES assures YEE, on the one hand, that the prisoners, if accused of any crime, shaU be brought before any judges whom he may depute to co-operate with the British authorities, and warns him, on the other, that the matter is reported to the Coummander of the naval force. There is certainlyno excess or presumption here.
At any time before October 11 these conditions might have been finaly accepted, but on that day Sir J. BowRiwG, having had cognizance of the affair, instructed Consul PARREs to require something more-viz., an apology for what had taken place, and an assurance that the British flag should be respected in future. This, however, though a little advance on the former terms, could scarcely be caUled extravagant, considering that YEH had withheld the moderate satisfaction required; and, moreover, Sir Jo expressly repeated the undertaking that Chinese offenders should always be surrendered on application, but that such proceedings must take place according to treaty. The naval force now appears more distinctly in view, but it is still in the distance, and its intended operations are avowedly confined to the seizure of an Imperial junk by way of reprisal. Well, on the 1Ith the junk was seized, but to no purpose; in fact, it turned out to be a tradingjunk, and not an Imperial man-of-war. So matters stood till the 20th, when, as 12 days had elapsed without satisfaction, Consul PAPanEs met Sir JonN Bowniso and Sir MICUAEL SzYMOQUR at Hongkong, anUd there a conference was held upon the whole affair. Here it was determined that the demands already made should be again preferred, and that if within 24 hours they were not satisfied measures of compulsion should be employed. These naeasures were defined to be, first, the capture of the Barrier Forts, as being at a distance from the city, and then, in the event of YEn'S still holding out (which was not anticipated), the capture of the Canton Forts also, with an attack upon YEn's own residence.
But now what had YEn offered in the way of concession ? Nothing that substantially met the requirements of the case. These requirements were, that he should satisfy the conditions of the treaty, and relieve the commerce of our colony from future apprehensions by returning the men who had been seized on the Arrow, especially the alleged delinquent, and by deputing authorities before whom, in conjunction with our own, the prisoner should be tried. It had been further, and not unreasonably, exacted of him that the restitution of the men should be as public as their capture, and that he should tender an apology for the past and an assurance for the future. More or less completely he evaded every one of these demands. He first offered nine out of the twelve men seized; then ten ; and at length, when pressed by the measures concerted on the 20th, all the twelve, but not publicly or in the nmanner required; while, so far was he from deputing the proper officer to conduct the case, that, even when he produced the 12 men, he stipulated that two of them should be sent back to him directly. The assurance demanded he offered in terms not quite satisfactory, but which would have been considered sufficient ; of the apology he said nothing at all.
From these facts it is clear that proceedings were taken step by step, without hurry, and without, as we humbly conxeeive, any undue presumption on the part of the stronger nation. Be it observed that up to this point not a shot had been fired, and, although so many days had passed, YEN might still have terminated the dispute by sending the prisoners back to the lorcha and tendering an apology, after which he might, by means of his own officials, have seen justice done on all the culprits, if culprits there were. At last, on the 23d, force was employed, and the Barrier Forts were taken, but with no better result.
We now approach a point of great importance, but we especially request the reader to observe that up to this moment not one syllable had been spoken about our right of entry into Canton. That this right had never been forgotten by our authorities is clear from the correspondence just published; but what we wish remarked is this, that at any time during this whole fortnight YEH might have healed the rupture and settled the entire affair by simply performing common restitution in the matter of the Arrow. It was not until the 25th of October-17 days after the outragethat this point was brought before Yzifs notice; and it could not, therefore, in any way have affected the course of affairs. But was it injudiciously urged at last ? We are aware of the instructions despatched to Dr. BOWBNiG by Lord MAL=sBuRy in 1852, to the effect that he should avoid all irritating discussions with the Chinese, and consequently abstain from mooting this point of admission to the city. But when the point 'was mooted the irritating discussions had been already encountered, and the motive for abstinence had vanished. As long as there was a chance of Yaw's yielding the subject was left untouched; it was only when not merely irritation, but actal conflict, had arisea that the oppor-
tanity was taken of gsttg a settlement onerfor all ; and unless, therefore, this conflict itself can be condemned the case is just as strong as ever. Lastly, therefore, could this conflict itself have been escaped?
Now, wre beg to ask by what proceedings oriat what point of them we could have held our hands in the transactions above related? If, as is plain, the outrage upon the Arrow calUed for notice, could redress have been asked for more moderately or waited for m^ore patiently, seeing that we required nothing more than restitution at first, and only restitution, apology, and assurance at last, while we actually remained till the 15th day after the outbreak without firing a shot? It must be remembered that our authorities were acting on behalf of a small community settled at the side of a fierce Oriental population.: Perhaps in the case of such a dispute with any European Power our purpose might have been answered by " suspending diplo"matic relations;" but how could such a course apply to YEm and his people, who, in accordance with the natural ideas of Eastern disputants, would have looked upon us as beaten and terrified ? But Icould instructions from home, at any rate, have been waited fort In our opinion, this course, as far as it could be, was the course actually taken. It was impossible that Consul PAP.KxS could make his demands without being prepared to
support them by some such arguments as YEE would understand, and equally impossible that those arguments could have stopped short at the capture of the Barrier Forts only. But when the Canton Forts were taken, and when our Marines had visited the Commissioner's residence, Admiral SEYwouR, although, to use his own words to YnrH, "the lives and property of the entire city popula"tion were at his mercy, and could be destroyed "by him at any moment," proceeded to no such extremity; but, as far as our last intelligence reached, was maintaining his position of ascendancy and waiting the event. Such is the plain story of the Chinese quarrel, in which, although we entirely share the regret professed by Lord DERBY at the whole occurrence, we can find no such errors of proceeding as his resolutions imply.
What could the CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER
What could the CHAY.ELL0R of the EXcEEQixg have done that he has not done ? Think a moment, and there can be only one answer-" He might have " let things remain as they were; the War Taxes to "expire according to the letter of the several Acts, "and the various scales of decline in the Income"tax, the Tea, Sugar, and Coffee Duties to run "their appointed course. Why selould he not "have done this ? It -would have brought much "about the same suan into the Exchequer, to a "milion or two, and it would not have been liable "to the charge of a retrograde tendency." Here, again, we can be at no loss for a reply. The country would certainly not have paid the War Ninepence, without which the rest of such a Budget would have been impossible. The country gentlemen would not have liked it ; the manufacturers would not have liked it, unless they could
tbrow the burden a little more on the country I gentlemen; the professional classes would not have liked it, and the Member for Buckinghamshire would have had a very good chance of a division against Government. But then, it may be said, a grand financier, a man of might and mettle, like Sir R. PEEL, would have been able to invoke the sDirit of the country, and overrule the pettier feelings and smaller interests of the Legislature. So let us suppose Sir G. a. LEwis such a man; and undoubtedly he is up to his work. It must occur at once to any one the least accustomed to follow out poHtical contingencies that this would have made Mr. GnADSTON} master of the situation; it would have given him an immense vantage-ground. The House would have been very equally divided on the point. Mr. GLADsToMN and his friends had ample grounds
for siding with either party. Supposing, on a 1 survey of the field, he had found the Budget, including the War Ninepence, the winning side, he might have come to the rescue of Sir C. LEwIs and proclaimed the triumph of his Budget of 1853, in spite of war and other casualties. We can imagine in this case how mildly, how respectfully, how affectionately, he would have performed the part of a friend in need. We can imagine how pleasant Sir G. a. LwIs would have found it to live on the broken victuals from Mr. GLADsro.-'s table, and be reminded every day of the source of his credit and the prop of his power. No doubt, too, Mr. GLAISTOxE would have been delighted to find those interesting little bantlings of his, the bundles of Exchequer-bonds dropping once a-year at the door of the Treasury, provided for comfortably at once with a round sum of 9,000,0001. instead of reappeariug year after year, and preferring eacb. time a new appeal for financial benevolence, they would have been provided with a good settlement, and heard of no more, at least not in an annoying way. bfr. GLADSTONR's Budget would thus have reigned from 1853 to 1860, and Sir G. C. Lx'is would only have been an interloper, an usurping regent, or a Gipsy nurse, carrying it out for a time. We will not speculate on the results of such a state of things; and it is all the less necessary to do so becaue we fully believe that Mfr. GLADsToNE would have found the other the winning side, and would have acted accordingly. It is true that on the first night of the Session he said that if to please their constituents the House gave up the War Ninepence it would have to supply the vacuum either by new loans or by fresh taxation, and that he declared -he would be no party to either expedient. But, then, this was on the supposition of the Army and Navy Estimates being only reduced to 25,000,0001.; and it is obvious that a reduction below 20,000,0001. would alter the case altogether. So there was nothing to prevent him from amalgamating his own Budget of 1853 with an Anti-War-Ninepence party, and beating Government with immense Hlat. It is conceivable, indeed-theoretically conceivable -that he would not have taken the victory that lay within his reach ; still, in Sir G. a. LEwIs's place, we would rather not have been absolutely in Mr. GLADsToiN-'s power. It is pleasanter to be one's own master.
Of course, we should not be justified in assuming that such were the actual considerations on which Sir G. C. Iswis arranged to do without the War Ninepence. That determination may well rest on its own merits. We should say the Budget is conceived in the spirit of compromise. First, there is a compromise, or a " third course," between retaining the War Ninepence and abandoning it, by laying an additional fourpence on the two succeeding years ; then there is the plan of dividing the burdens left by the war between direct and indirect taxation. Notwithstanding the mountains of maudlin talked on all sides against duties on Tea and Sugar, even to a late hour on Monday night, we beg to reserve a portion of our sympathy for the many hardworking men, with numerous families, and may be sickly wives, who are paying Income-tax, and who, perhaps, dismiss a servant to do so. So we see no such great sin in taking half what we want out of the desk, and half out of the teacaddy and sugarbasin. There is no necessity, then, for assuming that the Budget was framed with a view to Parliamientary tactics, important and indispensable as they are. By adopting a compromise the CHA-CxnOa of the ExCHUExR has incidentally beaten a double Opposition. On the other hand, the line adoptedby that double Opposition is best characterized by a word of their own choice. It is an adjustment. Neither limb of the Opposition knew quite what to do when the Session opened; so they have adjusted themselves to one another, like two trees in injurious proximity. An express declaration in favour of. the War Ninepence on the part of Mr. GLADSTONE would have damaged Mr. DISRAE, so that was left in the background. On the other hand, the latter gentleman would only venture on some delicate allusions to the perils which beset prospective Budgets, and the unhappy fate of declining scales of duty that never decline. They are, indeed, like troublesome visitors, who are always saying " Good bye," and returning again to fetch something or say something which they have forgotten. But the idea of an adjustment is as happily adapted for the concealment of difficulties as for bringing them to light. While the " adjustment" motion demanded categorical answers from Govern-
ment it tnrew the whole policy of the Opposition itself into the conditional mood. They had only to say " If you will not do this you must do that;
"and if you do this you can't do that, or must do "something else." Thus it was that Mr. DissuAr and Mr. GnDsTwE found a common ground in a profuse tender of hypothetical advice. Together they were as good as. a Pythi&n prieste3s. Taking he tripod by turns, each dealt in oommon
ambiguities, of which each had a diferent key. The scheme'was meritorious, but, like maiy otier clever schemes, it was frstrated by the simple Oxpedienta of honesty and decision. After maundering from the first evening of the session about the necesSity for the House knowing without the least delay what the public service reaUy required before the revenue should be touched, and vie jversd, MIr. DIsBI.r and Mr. GLADSTONE were taken fairly aback by Ministers suddenly producing both Estimates and Budget; and they found, to their disgust, that they had played their great card before the Session was three weeks old.
We are not in the least surprised at Air. GI.ADSTONSS display of feeling on this occasion. The annoyance under -which he is suffering is one perfectly intelligible to officials and aU holding by precarious tenure. Who does not know the feelings of an outgoing tenant, or of a clergyman quitting a parsonage, whenx the new-comer will not take a single article of his 'urniture? The latter, or his still more prudent or more fanciful wife, prefers new chintz to faded damask, a new carpet with a plain ground to pale roses and yellow lilies. She does not like heavy chairs, and prefers a round table to a square one. She wants a cabinet to stow away her knickknacks instead of a pompous console table. She prefers French beds to four-posters, and thinks that bookcases ought to lighten a room instead of darkening it. The outgoing tenant, ingenious man, spent a mint of money in fitted furniture, fitted shelves, fitted carpets, fitted secretaires, fitted wardrobes, bath, and everything. The incoming tenant does not like so close a fit. So he ruthlessly orders a clean sweep, and all sorts of faded splendour and fitted conveniences are pack-ed off to the broker's. There is hardly any human animosity equal to that which is generated by such transactions. When the newv-made Dean won't take a stick or arag of the old Dean'sfurniture, andthe new made Bishop, therefore, cannot take the furniture of the palace to which he is promoted, and the Bishop's widow is obliged to sell it, is it possible they should ever love one another in any stage of existence ? Now, Mr. GLADSTONE is a gentleman with a peculiar taste, and a great taste for fitting. When in office he fitted the nation with a curious and elaborate system of finance. He cut up a large portion of the national debt into pieces exac'ly going into successive years, and squaring with presumed annual surpluses. He fitted several of our taxes to run into corners and passages. It was a marvel of " adjustment." But " acci" dents will occur in the best regulated house" holds ;" and while Mr. GLADSTONm was rejoicing in the general fitness of things there came a horrid war which unfitted everything, himself with the rest, and put a successor in his office. Here, then, is the grievance. Sir G. C. IaWIS won't take one of his fixtures that he can help; he won't have Mr. GLDSToNie's fitted Income-tax or his fitted Tea and Sugar Duties; he wil have them in the shape he prefers, and he likes things rather squarer. He only takes the Exchequer-bonds because there is no help, and he could not get rid of them without pulling the house to pieces. But he does not appreciate them. Mr. GLADSTONE, therefore, has to stand by and see aU his nicely-fitted arrangements torn up, wrenched from the woodwork, prised from the walls, swept away, heaped into a corner, and sold for what they will fetch. Sir G. C. LEWIs, too, does it all with a cold-blooded, almost savage, indifference to the tenderest of human infirmities. He makes no more of ripping an old Budget up and consigning it to the dustbin in the sight of the maker, than he would of throwing away an old pair of shoes. The Budget of 1853 was the most exquisite piece of financial ingenuity ever framed by the hand of man, like one of those complicated fabrics in the Great Exhibition which everybody admired and nobody would buy. Some of them, we believe, are still in the orangery at Kensington Palace, and we should not be surprised if Mr. GADSTONE'S Budget be one day found among them, between a memoria technica, a centrifugal pump, and a speaking automaton. Inventors are indeed an unfortunate race, so often are they not only unrewarded, but corapelled to see their daintiest devices converted into lumber. Think of the man who could teU Mr. GLADSTO2 to his face that his Exchequer-bonds coming due were nothing in the world but war debts ! But it can't be mended now, and, as the Budget of 1853, like Troy, " has been" and is no more, it is only a waste of power to maL-e any fuss about it.
It is difficult to attach any serious importance
It is difficult to attach any serious importance to the various propositions which are made from time to time in the House of Commons for a fundamental change in our representative system. No doubt the fact that a general election is not, in any case, a very remote event lends additional fervour to the zeal of our more ardent patriots. Then, again, there is the pleasure of throwing a shell into the MIinisterial camp, which, although it cannot produce any serious effect upon the fortunes of the day, may at least oerve to embamrass and damage individuals. If the question were a serious one at the present moment, we should not speak slightingly of it, for it is of the highest importance, and when the time has arrived for taking it into consideration it will be a very serious one indeed. That time, howver, has not yet arrived, and meanwhile we must take the liberty of considering our would-be Reformers as men not very much in earnest. It is with the life of a nation as with the life of a man. Let any of us follow out the history of his day from the moment of his rising until that other moment when he sighs for nothing so much as blankets and oblivion, and he will readily understand the defects of the wrong time and the wrong place. Suppose, now, when a man jumps out of bed intent upon tooth-brushes, razors, and so forth, his servant were to come into the room and place a basin of hot mock-turtle soup before him, he wouldtumn with disgust from the savoury mixture, which at noon he might welcome with enthusiasm. Suppose, again, at dinner tine the attendant who waited behind your chair were to present you, in place of the accustomed modicum of soup, with a razor and a shaving-brush, it would be felt that those useful instruments were then out of place. Suppose, finally, that just as you were disposed for bed and had completed the few drowsy preparations Jomx were to walk in with a flat candlestick and press you with the honest fervour of a faithful iollower to step into a cold shower-bath, which he had set in nice order for your reception, you would probably refuse the proffered refreshment, which at the commencement of your daily labours might have been acceptable enough. Te time was not rightly chosen. This is just the objection we have to make to such propositions as those of Mfr. Locxz KING of last week and to that of Sir JosHuA WArLmsxm of last night. They are offering us the soup in our dressing-rooms, the razors at our dinner-tables, and the shower-bath when we are intent upon bed. This nation at the present moment is stretching its liinbe after the fatigue of the Russian war. It is intent upon reducing its expenses within reasonable limits without impairing the efficiency of its meaus of defence. We have a couple of small wars upon our hands. We have to give a good deal of attention to legal reforms, and some little thought to education, to postal communica* tions, and to a few matters of the like kind. Oec-
tainy a- Reform in Parliament is about the lat point oA-wvhich any solicitude is felt or expressed.
The propoeition, however, made last night by Sir JosH:A. WAram= would be inadmissible even had the time arrived for taking the whole subject into consideration. His idea was a Select Committee, to consider ana report on the most practical means for lessening the existing inequalities in our representative system, and for extending to the unenfranchised a share of political power. To refer questions so grave as these, as to which no deficiency of knowledge exists, to a Select Comnmittee is simply to mistake the functions of such a body. It is highly proper that such a question as that of our Banking system, upon which great differences of opinion exist among practical and wellinformed men, should be so referred. The points at issue are obscure, the diversities of opinion great, the argument one of pure reason. So with regard to questions of Legal Reform, of the Decimal Coinage, and so forth. It is natural and rational that the House should east upon a few members selected from its entire number the duty of carrying through inquiries of this sort and of reporting the result. It is also right that the House should in such a case esteem itself in great measure bound by the report of its committee, or the business of the nation could never be carried on; but with regard to a new Reform BiU the contrary of the cases just supposed actually exists. There is no man who pretends to the slightest tincture of political knowledge, or who professes to feel the faintest interest in the public occurrences of the day, who does not already possess all the knowledge upon the subject of Parliamentary Reform which a Select Committee of the House of Commons, though it sat through the whole session, could hope to give him. What could such a body tell us that we do not already know ? Then, again, it is to be said-would the House consent to be bound by the report of its committee upon so momentous a matter? Parliamentary Reform is ezzentially a question of conificting prejudices and interests. We never hope to see more than a series of compromises in our time, but these are points for the consideration of a fuU House, not of a Select Committee upstairs. Lord PALBmRSxoN last night saw this point. " The matter," said he, " is of the greatest importance, and one of too wide "a range and affecting too many material interests "to be thrown loose upon the chance decision of "a committee." Sir GEoRaE STsRcxLxr.yD, although a Reformer of old standing, was equaly opposed to the proposition. He did not want any " rambling " and fishing" committees, which would never further the objects of Reform. Mfr. T. DuNcoNsB, who certainly does not belong to the reactionary party, was stiU more severe upon poor Sir Josnu. " He was not prepared to insult the unenfranchised "by sending their claims and demands to a Select "Committee, like a railway or a cemetery. The "question should be discussed in the House in
the light of day." Sir JosHuA's proposition does not seem to have given satisfaction to any member who took a serious share in the discussion, excepting Ir. Fox, and was finally negatived by 190 to 73.
Thus, then, the second Reform Bill of the session is disposed of; we dare say more remain behind, and these will no donbt receive as speedy a dismissal. There have always been, and always wil be, members who have one panacea for aU political evils, aud this they wiU thrust down our throats, whether our constitution happens at the moment to require the remedy or not. They are men of one idea, and out of this one idea the world of intelligence is to t'nem a blank. When we see men like Lord Josr RussmLL, Mr. Locrs KmsG, and Sir JosUuA WAL1Ey coming forward in season and out of season with the same bolus for all our infirmities we are always reminded of Mr. CAuNiN'S story of the " Red Lion." There stood in former days in one of our agricultural counties an inn which enjoyed great popularity in the neighbourhood, and which bore for ensign a Red Lion. Now, it so happened that this famous place of entertainment required renovation, both externaUy and internally, and for a moment, to the universal regret of the neighbourhood and to the temporary discredit of the establishment, the glories of the Red Lion were painted out, The proprietor, however, had the sense to see this would never do-the public would have their old riend back again. He determined, therefore, to call in the assistance of an artist who had devoted his whole time and attention to the painting of RedLions. So said, so done. A great Red Lion, sternly hospitable, swung upon the sign-post outside. Red Lions raged profusely about the commercial room, the tap, the bar, the assembly room. Even in the bedrooms the favourite emblem was to be found, big or little, as the case might be. One room only-the sanchonv of the establishment-had been held sacred from the inroads of the Red Lion. The landlord really wished to have something different painted there by way of a change. He consulted the artist, who promised to sleep upon it, and in the morning to give him the result of his meditations. " Well, Mr. BoNIFAcE," said the painter on the next day, " I couldn't get a wink " of sleep last night for thinking on this new idea " of yours; but I think I have hit it at last. "Just look at the chimney there; see how the "light falls. Suppose, now, I were to paint above "the mantelpiece a small but beautiful Red Lion T" What Mr. BONIFACE replied is not on record, but the House at any rate last night speedily ejected Sir JosHnru WALsusLx's Red Lion in spite of its exceedingly mild roar.

Explosion Of Gas On Board A Belgian
ExrLosiox oF GAS o0 BOAInD A Bi )L£T 1xi-SEL.-On Monday Mlr. Favell, coroner, concluded a long inquiry at South Shields into the cause of the death of Francis Msese, who was killed, and three other -eamen badly injured, by an explosion of gas coal on board tLe Prince Philippe, of Ostend, as she was leaving the Tyne for Trieste on Friday. The explosion had done extensive injury to the vessel, and the evidence proved that it had been occasioned by the mate, Kestile Eugene, taking a lantern into the forehold, at which the gas exploded. IEu gene is fearfully burnt, and the unfortunate deceased ard Jacob Holstein, another seaman, were blown over tl e vessel's foreyard into the Tyne. The coals vith which the vessel was laden were of a very fiery niature. They had been shipped on Wednesday, and the batches battened down after. It seems that they had been wiought in the low seam of the Felling Pit, 1,000 feet below tte surface, where the men work with the Davy lamps. The coals had been sent direct from the pit to the vessel, and, as the hatches had been put down immediately after the cargo had been taken aboard, light carburetted hydrogen had been rapidly evolved, which had fired as soon as the mate went below with a light with all the force of n- powder. The jury, in retunzing a verdict that the death of the seaman had been caused by the explosion, expressed an opinion that vessels taking in this class of coals should be provided with ventilators, by which the recurrence of such casualties would be prevented.
NATIONAL SUxDAY LBAG( -A public meeting, attended by about 6,000 persons, was held on Sunday last on Newcastle-moor, to protest against the conduct of the op pnents of the National Sunday League at a meeting hel'd on the previons Monday night, and to adopt a petition to Parliament in favour of the objects of the League. The ebair was taken by Mr. Thomas Gregson. Mr. Cowan who employs a great number of persons in the neigh beourhood, moved a resolution expressive of the opinmon of the meeting that the efforts ot the National Sunday League to obtain the opening of museumns, galleries,
on Sundays deserved the support of the worlng. classes. The resolution also censured the conduct of the Qi ponents of the Sunday League rt the meeting on the 16th int at aewcastle. Richard Reed, a worlking-man, seconded the resolution to which an anendment was moved by the Rev. Mr. Rutherford. The resolution was, however, carlied by a large majoritT, and the petition to Parliament, in favour of the objects sought for by the League, ruet with the general assent of the meeting, only 14 hands being held up against it. The immense but orderly meeting, after gtvng three cheers for tho Sunday Leaue, returned to heir omes. Mr. Rutherford declarod aimself wlling to hold a discussion on the Sunday question, which was at once accepted by the friends of the League; so that there Is every reason to believe that the Tyne has seea only the beginning of this question.

THB PUBLIC HEALTH.
(From the Registrar.General's Weekly Return.)
The total number of deaths registered in London in the veek that ended on Saturday was 1,243. In the first week of this month tho deaths rose to 1,368; with a warmer teempeature during the succeeding two weeks, they have beenI on the deoline. In the 10 years 1847-56 the average num. ber of deaths in the weeks corresponding with last week was 1,211; and in order that the deaths of last week, which occurred in an increased population, may be com pared with the average, the latter shonld be raised by a tenth part, in vwhich case it will become- 1,332. The result of the comparison is favourable as regards the present state of the public health.
In the three weeks of February the mean weekly tempera. ture was consecutively 32 3 deg., 40 9 deg., and 42-5 deg. In the same periods the deaths caused by diseases of the respiratory organs (exclusive of phthisis) were 359, 307, and 288. The 288 deaths in the present return nearly agree witlh the corrected average, which is 294. But hooping-cough appears to be xather on the increase, the deaths from this complaint in each of the last four weeks having been 57, 61, 70, and 74. Scarlatina has not prevailed much for some time, and last 'Week the deaths from it were reduced to 23. It was not latal in a single case in the central districts. There were only four deaths from smallpox, and none of these in the eastern or southern divisions. Measles was fatal to 35 ohlldren; in the Marylebone Workhouse five deaths have occurred from this disease since the 8th inst. The registrar of St. Peter, Walwortb, states that fever is common in the sseighbourhood of theWestmoreland-road, in his sub-district. Of 37 cersons whose deaths are recorded in the week, and svho were 80 years old or more, it appears that only one, a farmer's widow, had attained the age of 90 years. A '-abourer, aged 70 years, died on the 12th inst. in Royal Miz, street, Whitechapel, from want. TTwo persons died Eroru intemperance.
Last week the births of 975 boys and 904 girls, in all 1,879 ChhUdren, were registered in London. In the 10 correspondlng weeks of the years 1847-56 the average number was 1,592.
At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean height of the barometer in the week was 29-988 in. On the last three days the meau daily reading was above 30 in. The highest reading was 30-18 in., and occurred on Saturday. The mean temperature of the week was 42-5 deg., which is 4'ldeg. above the average of the same week in43 years. The mnean temperature was on every day after Sunday above the uverage. The highest temperature occurred on Tuesday, and was 56 deg.; the lowest was 2S-2 deg., and occurred on Mitonday. The range of the week was 27 8 deg. The mean dew-point temperature was 39 3 deg., -.i the difference between this and the mean temperature of the air was 3-2 deg. The wind blew from the south and south-west, except on Sunday, when it was in the morning in the north-east.
ohere was no rain, but occasionally fog or haze prevaUed.

THE CR1asEAm AitMy.-Some returns just published give the following details respecting the army in the Crimea. It appears that the total number of cavalry who joined the army in the ERst amounted to 4,S91 of whom 386 were kied or wounded ; the Royal Artillery to 7,032, of whom 794werekilled or wvounded *theSappersand Miners to 403, of whom 140 were killed and wounded - and the total infantry to 43,276, of whom 13,297 were kil'ed or wounded Thus, the general total of all arms was 55,530, and of these 14,631 were killed or wounded. A separate return shows that up to the 1st of June, 1856, 2,755 officers and men (in. eluding 157 officers) were killed in the Crimea, and that 515 officers, 5791 non-commissioned officers, and 10,782 men were wounded. Of the wounded 86 officers, 85 non-commissioned officers, and 1,848 men died ; while 147 officers, 574 noncommissioned officers, and 15,320 men died from sickness, and 1,137 non-commissioned officers and 13,.581 men were in valided at the end of the war. 2,627 horses were lost, of wvhich 401 were killed.
THE ScorrLsH EPIscoP,i, CswxRM.-It appears from a Parliamentary paper moved for by Mr. Gladstone, hI-P., and published yesterday, that a Treasury minute was issued on the 24th of June, 1856, announcing to the trustees of the Scotch Episcopal fund that the grant (of 1,2001.) would be discontinued for the future, on account of the great objections raised in. Parliament to the payments iitherto made for civil contingencies, in the justice of which objections the Lords of the Treasury are compelled to coner. This was in reply to a petition from the trustees praging that the grant might he made an nnaual one, and showing that the Scottish Episcopalian clergy are, pecuniarily, in a very poor case, the clergy poe
sessing, on the average, incomes of 901., vwthout parsonages, and the bishops incomes of 1501. The bishops are seven in number, and the clergy 160. The Scotch Episcopalian clergy are also subject to grievous restrictions, as clergymen ordained by Scoteh bishops can only officiate in England for two Sundays consecutively (by a formal license), while no Scotchman or Englishman ordained by a Scotch bishop can hold any cure of souls in England. The Scotch Episcopal clergy therefore urge the introduction of a Bill to abolish these and other disabilities, as a sort of set-off against the withdrawal of the grant, and the Lords of the Treasury proxnised, in a minute of the 12th of September last, that any such Bill should receive the best consideration of Her Majest's Government.
DEATH OF A GASTRONOME.-Chevet, the famous xetaUler of eatables, was struck at 9 o'clock in the afternoon of Friday with apoplexy at his house in the Palais Royal. Chevet was the youngest of five sons left by the founder of the shop in the Palais toyal, and hetwas moreover the ost celebratedl of the dynasty. In the year 1855 he realized fnore than 6,0001. by his buffet at the national exposition. As to his miraculous dinners and his culinary triumphs, rhich he alone knew how to invent and to organize, they are of gastronomical notoriety, and it belongs alone to the
ournand ds Gourmeands to transmit them to posterity. M. Chevet was only 68 years of age when he died, whlle sleep. ing in Iis easy chair. Very, the glorious rival of Chevet,

The Colliery Explosion Near Barnsley.
THE COLLIERY EXPLOSION NEAR BARNSLEY.
TUESDAY Axuooy.,T
I reported to you on Saturday evening that it had been decided not to fill the mine with incombustible gas on Goldsworthy's plan, but instead to allow the water to accumulate in the pit, and to throw in steam by means of a steam jet connected with the boilers by which the colliery was worked. This arrangement has been carried out, and there will consequently by this time be a large accumulation of water in the pit, from which while the pit was at work from 200 to 300 gallons per minute was pumped. It is principally upon the prevention of ventilation by keeping the shafts closed and the accumulation of water, that the hopes are rested of the speedy extinction of the fire. It is not considered that the introduction -of steam will have any considerable effect. The gentlemen left upon the spot, to whom the management of the pit has been intrusted, have very carefully carried out the decisions of the committee who met on Saturday evening, and have had the satisfaction of finding that the temperature within the pit has gradually diminished. When the thermometer was first suspended 20 yards down the pit, on the afternoon of Friday, the temperature was 105'. On Saturday afternoon it had descended to 85°, and when the last experiment was tried this morning it had got to 75A', being 10' lower. The gentlemen managing on the spot are in constant communication by. telegraph with Mr. Wood, the colliery viewer from the north, and the other gentlemen who have been consulted on the subject. Steam is introduced into the pit by a pipe 1L inch in diameter, and the mouth of the ventilating shaft has been entirely closed, as well as those of the downcast shafts. Mr. Nicholas Wood, an eminent mining engineer, Mr. G. Elliott, Mr. Woodhouse, of Derby (also eminent as mining engineers), meet the local committee at 2 o'clock to-morrow (Wednesday) to consider what further steps may be necessary. It is admitted that great care will be requisite on the opening of the pit, as in case it is opened too soon the fire may again blaze out and another terrific explosion result. It is, however, thought not improbable that the fire may be so thoroughly extinguished as to permit of the pit being reopened towards the close of the present week. There is, however, no probability that any of the bodies in the pit will be recovered, at all events before next week, as a considerable time will be required to pump the large quantity of water which will have accumulated in the pit, and a considerable further time to renew the ventilation.
Durnn the last few days the proprietors of the colliery have haa the most diligent inquiries made with a view to ascertain the exact number of persons still in the pit, and of cotrse dead, and the number turnis out to be no less than
It is thought probable that some few more names may still be ascertained, but there is no doubt that 182 is within a very few indeed of the real number, if, indeed, it is not the exact number.
The terrible calamity has excited the greatest commisera"ion in the district, and there is no doubt that a general subseription wfill be made on behalf of those who are bereaved by it, as in the case of the Holmfirth floods. A meeting has been called at Barnsley for Thursday next, to organize a lan for raising a subscription there. The meeting is caled in comphance with anumerously-signed requisition, and it is expected that Earl Fitzwilliam will preside.
A subscription has been opened in Sheffield, and it is expected that the same course will be followed in Manchester. The proprietors have already received sub4 criptions of a. and 101. from clergymen in London and gentlemen in Leeds and other places.
Mr. (Coe, the underground steward, is spoken of as a man of considerable ability, and it appars that the miners had the utmost confidence 'in his skillaend care; indeed, he was forinerly engaged at the Manor Oaks Colliery, Barnsley, and it is aseerted that one object of the recent strike at that place was to get him reinstated in the office of steward there, which he had vacated.
Anecdotes of painful interest keep coming to light in connexion with the shocking affair. A story is told of a man named Simmonds, who came to the bottom of the pit during the period of the explorations on Thursday, but, being dehrious from the gas he had inhaled, broke away from the men who endeavoured to hold him, and ran Into the dangerous part of the pit, where he perished. Among the victims is also a young mnan, the son of respectable parents* residing near Holmfirth, who left home, and, after pur. suing a career of recklessness, was driven by want to work at this pit,where hehad just been discovered by his parents. fe had promised to return home on Saturday evening.
The coroner has given orders that the bodies when recovered shall be kept near the pit, in a. capacious shed to be erected for the purpose, and to be ticketed with numbers ad, where identifcation is possible, names preparatory
tothe inquest.

PRISONS OF GREAT BRITAIN.-A small blue-book,
PRTSONS OF GREAT BRITArT.-.A small blue-book, just out, gives a series of tabular statistics of crime for the year 1854. That year exhibited a considerable increase in the numbers over those of 1853. The number for trial in 1853 was 26.S04, and in 1854 29,266, showing an increase of 2,482, or 921 per cent. The convi'ctions, corapared with the comipittals, show a trifling increase. The aggregate "1summaLry convictions"' also exhibit azu increase, froma 71,580 to 74,574, or 41 per cent. The heads of increase are military prisoners, the agrant Act, the Larceny Act, the Police Act, and the Malicious TresDass Act. The following heads exhibit a decrease-viz, Gamue Laws, Revenue Laws Bastardy Laws, assaults, and reputed thieves. Juvenile offenders exhibit an increaso of 11-7 per cent. (from 9,348 to 10,444). The number recommitted increased from 33,565 to 35,350. There were 57 pardons on medical grounds in 1854, and 210 deaths. The state of instruction exhibits no improvement whatever on othecontrary, there is an increase of 5-3 per cent. in 1854 in the proportion of these who were entirely without inStruCtion beyond the average of the four previous years, although the three classes comprised in the " total with little or no instruction" show the same proportion as the average of the four y
1854. In the last year (1854) 95-2 per cent.were"wit

The total expenditure for the maintenance of prisoners in ]854 was 508,9641. (for 116,291 prisoners), being an increase of 58, 5481. as compared with the year 1853.

Free Emigration To The British Colonies.
FRBEB MIGRATION TO THE BEITISH
COLONIElS.
A meeting, convened by the British Workmen'r Assoia
tion, was held at the Great-ball, Broadway, Westmn "ster yesterday evening, in favour of the above object.
The chair was taken by Mr. Neale Porter; the hall was was crowded to suffocation by the working men of the locality, and the meeting was of a.most orderly and unsnimous description.
After an address from the CHAut?,tA
The first resolution was moved by Mfr. BROWN, carpenter, nd seconded by Mr. HA7COOCP, cabinetmaker:-
"That this meeting, conisting of working men, urgently calls the.
attention of Her MajCety's Governmeut and of all classes of society to the severe, wide-spread, and alarming distress existing in the metro.
roll,, the result of a lonu and continuing stnation iu the building and other trades.
Mr. TowERs, carpenter, and Mr. OsBoRn, dealer in cabinet work, moved and seconded the next resolution to the effect that,-
This meeting, looking to the causes which have led to a colapse In
the Important tradeand m the other branches of industry referred to, can wee no prospect ofspeeds improvement, nor any reason to expect, for many mouths to come, adequate occupation for the thousands of intelligent and well-dispoeed wrorking men of various trades wbo have been for many weeks out of employmc7.t and are now, with their -ives and chdren, enduring most acute and almost latolerable privations."
Mr. KxvTH BA1;1 R moved-
" Thus depressed by compulsy Idleness and harassed by its attendant palniul evils and hardshp, we all of us, men able amd willing towork, see thatour only hooe Is in Immediate emigration, nd, being warmly attached to the free institutions ot England, we look forour future home and happiness to the ritish colonies of Anatralia, Newv Zealwand and Canada.
Mor. RonvEsos, labouoer, in peconding the resolution, said e thought that embgration was the only remedy for the wide-spreadndistress at present existing, and gave some instances n p roofE of his opinion, bt at the same teome he recommended all persons seriously to consider w,hether they were fitted for it, as once done it could not be reversed
Mr. Bon to , stone meson, proposed fthe fousth resolau tion:
*fl- meeting, in the name of the general body of uoemployed eorkmen, earne,tly and emphaticaly appeals to the Government to recogncthe *burgency of the Present crists, and in thae prompt meay sures to esable those who am starving here to emigrate to the colonies, where their labour and sill, while raising themselels from destitution to the enjoyment or an abudaPnc of the neostsaries of life, would,bythedevelopment of the vst resourcesofathosepssseio s
gives healthy stiminus toth7e industryanda sound and safeexpansion to thecouamerceof the mother country."
The speaker said he wvas sure that the Government 'gore nlot faUly conscious of the extent of the distress in the co-tetry, bat that when they were they would give the workinG men every assistaNce they required to enable them to emigrathd
For his own part, he did not wish to go ot as a pauper, but
hould be qufte wialing that the necessary amount should be lent to him, even if he bad to pay 6Per cent, interest for it. The working men of this country were driven to crieue by their present destitution, but he was sare that nine-tenths of those who heard him aoald rather etasrve than do so.
bor. DEtVOatOteT seconded the resolution, and said he did not care where he went,h a longaas it was to some British colony.
The fifth and last resolaion was moved and seconded by whr. KAnd, plasterer, and gv. aORRELry, painter:-
Tbis oerting, although, owing to the almost absolute destitution
of the great mass of the people which it represents, compelled to ask
for an entirely sree passe t the colonies as far as regards present
payment hy emigrants adopge as a prominent,and distinct condition o
udi a boon thatpthvle o cot of their conveyance shalbe repa toby nl perons so assisted thin a ertain tie abter thei amrivrcei
The hon lma then caled upon the Rev. Mr. Maurice, who kindly camxe forwvard and gave a very feeling address to the working men upon the benefits of emigration.
Mr. H. )tuamoNn, MY., said he never heard in the course of his life an hour and;a-half of such good speaking, and this was because the men who had addressed the meetmg vo5keadrmn their hearts. It was unnecessary to go
ntages of emigraton, hut let not those who did not approve it put obstacGes in the way of these who wished to go. He believed the Government were well inclined to assist the movement, but they must recollect in borrowing money for the purpose it waS necessary to take it out of somebody's pocket, and this was the worst tirae to ask for it. He would recommend, in addition, an appeal to private benevolence, and he did not; see hy the ships of war should not be employed in carrying out emigrants to Australia and elsewhere. After some further observations, the hon. gentleman moved a vote of thanks to the Chair. man.
Ir. OSsioBsi seconded it.
The OHAsnssBt, ackanowledged the compliment, and read a petition to he presented to the HIouses of Lords and Commons, embodying, in effect, the resolutions which had lteen unanimously carried during the evening. Se concluded by reading a list of subscriptions from various gentlemen towards promoting the objects of the meeting, amounting to between 301. and 401.
An Historian's Aberration.-A curious in-
As HISTORIAN's AmBBATioN.-A curionis inshnce of abstraction of mind from the dull details of legal duty in the case of the popular historian and Scotch county jdge, Sir Archibald Alison, came before the law courts at Esdinburgh last week. An apDeal to the Court of Session was made against an interlocutor of Sir Archibald, as sheriff principal of Lanarkshire, pronounced on the 13th of September last. It appeared that the pursuerof the actior, Mr. George Turnbull, merchant, Glasgow, hadgiven to the defender, Air.Thomas Morton, farmer, East Kilbride the use of a horse for its keep. On the 4th of February, 1856, the defender was ab a curling match at Limekilnburn, and set out in his gig with some friends on his return about 10p.m., driving the pursuer's horse. The night was dark and the road was glazed with ice. The party, if they had not been influeneed by, had at least participated in the social parting glass, and they were "going merry home." That the defender himself was sobet was, however, established by the declaration of one of the witnesses-that he was a Free Church elder. Near the top of a hill above Rutheran toll-bar a carter in the employment of a carrier had left his horse and cart standing, wlhile with a lighted candle he proceeded to look for a lost whip. Neither vehicle had lights, for lights were not wontedly used in the parish, and, in the carter's absenee, the gig came into collision with the cart. Both horses were run into by the opposing shafts, the carrier's horse being kilUed on the spot, and the gig horse dying two days afterwards. The lender of the gig horse pursued the borrower for its value, which claim the latter resisted on the ground that the animal was not kIlled by carelessness or mismanagement, but by accident. The case came first before the sheriff substitute atHaamilton,wlofound the defender liable for 201. as the value of the horse, and in expenses. The defender appealed to the sheriff principal, whose inter. locutor found as follows :-Having heard parties, &c., finds it proved that the pursuer's horse was left standing in the centre of the road by the ptirsuer's servant, who had chare of it, at the top of a hill, in the dark, on the public highway, on the occasion libelled, when the defender's horse and gig ran into it, and both horses were killed. Finds it proved that the night was very dark. Finds it proved that the defender and his party had becn getting some refresh. nient at a publichouse before the collision took place, which was about 10.30 p.m., but none of them were drunk-, and neither party had any lights. Finds it proved that the collision was very violent, and the shafts of the pursuer's cart were forced into the neck of the defender's horse. Finds it proved that the defender was driving at an ordinary pace when the collision took place, and not furiously. Finds, in point of law, in these circumnstances, that there were faults on both sides; on the defender's in not looking properly ahead, and driving rather faster than was prudent in so dark a night t on the pursaer's servant's in leaving his horse and cart alone, on the highway, at a distance from the toll-house, when the said servant, for whom the pursuer is responsible, was loitering in or near the toll-house. Finds, in these circumstances, that the preponderance of blame was on the pursuer's part, in respect of hs servant having left his horse and cart alone on the public road in so dark a night; therefore, alters the interlocut *r appealed from, and assoilzies the defender from the whole conclusions of the libel, and decerns. Finds the defender entitled to expenses, subject to modification. Modifies the same to one-half of the defender's costs. The origin of the whole confusion was evidently Sheriff Alison's mistaking of the pursuer, who lent the horse, for the carrier, whose horse was also killed, but who had nothing to do with the action at all. When the case came before the second division of the Court of Session the Lord Tustice Clerk asked counsel if they were sure they had not printed a wrong interlocutor, for this one seemed so inapplicable to the case. In advising the case his Lordship remarked that the interlocutor was altogether unexampled in his experience. Lord Miurray said he confessed he had a suspicion that the learned sherifs mind had been so engrossed in historical matters that it was not in a condition to consider anything so modern as an interlocutor. But oonus aiquando doreimat Homei-us. He was not for taking any particular notice of it, except what could not be avoided, for judges could err hke other people. The result was that the interlocutor of the sheriff' ncspal was altered, and the Court found the defender liable" to the pursuer in the suni of 201. and expenses, as the sheriff substitute had originaly done.
THE LATE BuRGARY AT AsHovEsR.-Some further information of an important character has been obtained with regard to the burglary at Ashover, which was described in yesterday's paper. ln a sma'l plantation near the rev. gentleman's house was found part of a Birmingham newspaper, supposed to have been left by the burglars. It also appears that five persons were seen on the evening previous in the vilage, and that they took up their ibode for the night in an outbuilding near the hall. The young lady, Miss Heeley, who made her escape in the miraculous manner described, is slowly recovering. She was not in a state to be spoken to until yesterday, when she said that, he&ring the urglaxs coming intoher room, she stood againstthedoor to prevent them, and, expecting they would enter, she opened her window and suspended herself by her hands from the window-sill until complete exhaustion compelled her to let go her hold, and she fell in the yard below, a distance of 14 feet, and injured her back. One of the sup. pined buro1rs is described by the Rev. J. Nodder as a thick-built man about 5ft. 6in, or 7in., dressed in dark clothes, and boots with brass lacehoes. He passei through Chesterfield, and called at a ublichouse, where he made inquiries about the train, and booked himself at the Chesterfield station for Derby, whence he was subsequently traced to Birmingham. He described himself as a cork. cutter, and said he had been robbed by five men and a woman. An officer has been despatched to Birmingham in quest of him.
FASHIONABLE LIFE nT PARIS.-TheO yoUng Princess Iza Czartoryslka, daughter of Prince Czartorysid, was marrned on Saturday at the Church of St. Louis en rile to Count Dzialynski, the son of Count Dzialynski a large landed proprietorin the Grand Duchy of Posen, ana brother of the Countess Zamoyska, whose husband commanded the Polish Legion in Turkey. The Cardinal Archbishop of Bordeaux officiated, and the ceremony was attended by the Princess Ladislas Czartoryska, sister-in-law of the bride and daughter of Queen Christina, by several of the principal Polish refugees in Paris, by Marshal Magnan, and by a
number of personages of distinction. On the return of the i wfedding party to the E[otel Lambert, the residence of the parents of the bride, the orphan girls suppcorted by the Princess Czartoryska were founud drawsn up inthe court. yard, dressed in white, and offered bouqulets to the bride.

*MAI.SION sousE-The LOBD MAYOR requested that the press would acknowledge his receipt of 21. from c 4Mrs. J.," Walthamstow, for the poor-box.
GUILDHALL.-Thomas Augustus Parnell, a taU thin mez, about 35 years of age, shabbily dressed, and described in the charge-sheet as a clergyman, was charged under the foUowimg ciretiinstanAces:
eolice-constable 334 said-I was on duty in Farringdonstreet yesterday afternoon, when theprisoner came isp to me and said he w^ished to give himself into custody. e asked him what he had done, and he replied that he had murdered his wife and three children at 24, Whitechapel, LiverpooL
took him to the station and searched hirn, when I found ls. OAd., some letters, and memoranda. He toll me that he
had no home, and that he was a clergyman of the Church of Englaad. I telegraphed to Liverpool to ascertain if the murder desribed by the prisoner had occurred, but I have not yet received any answer.
Alderman Ross.-When did you do that? Witness.-Last night, your worship.
Alderman Rosz.-Where did you telegraph to?
Witness.-To the superintendent of police at Liverpool; and I waited at the telegraph-office, but got no reply.
Alderman RosE-It is very extraordiiary.
Prisoner.-I had been drinking, Sir, and was very n- happy, and did not know what I was doing.
Alderman ROSE.-So it seems, for it appears by these letters that you are addicted to drinking.
Witness (handing up a paper).-This is where his wife and children are, Sir.
Alderman RosE (to prisoner).-Then your wife and family are all alive. Is that so?
Prisoner-Yes, Sir.
Alderman RosE-Have you seen anything in his manner officer, to lead you to believe that the prisoner is not right in his mind?
Officer.-Yes, Sir; he has been teaching for a gentleman at :Clapbam-con^mon. (Laughter).
MJr. MLartin (the chief clerk).-You do not understand the question. Have you noticed anything about him to make you tbink he is insane?
Officer.-Nothing at all, Sir.
Alderman RosE.-I shaU remand you, prisonei, unlil Thursday, and, whatever inconvenience it may be to yoursef -you have brought it on by your own conduct, and must take the consequences.
The prisoner was then remanded, and the officer ordered to produce a medicai report of the prisoner's state of mind on Thursday next.
In the course of the afternoon a communication was received from the superintendent of the Liverpool police, stating that the prisoner's statement was entirely false, his wife and children being alive and well, and,further, that no death had occurred in the house.
Bow-sTsxr.-Catherine Speed, an exceedingly ugly young woman, of such dwarfish stature that her head barely reached the top of the bar, was charged upon suspicion of having administered to Catherine Speed, her mother, a dose of 20 gramins of antimony,with intent to poison her.
Margaret James stated that she was the wife o. a working man, and the prisoner was her sister. Her mother, who was 77 years of age, kept a lodging-house in Grafon-streetEast, and the prisoner lived with her, but they did not agree very well. About noon on Monday her mother was ta-en with a violent fit of vomiting, and continued very ill all day. In the evening the doctor was sent for, and he said she had taken antimony. Just before being taken ill her mother had drunk some beer which the prisoner had mixed for her. They had had some words that day. About a week before they had a quarrel, and the prisoner threatened to " do for" her mother. After that the old lady was taken ill in precisely the same manner as on this occasion.
Mr. Jones, resident surgeon at University College los-
pital, was called in to attend the patient. The symptoms were those of antimony. The last witness showed him what was left of the beer prepared for her by prisoner. He analyzed it, and found It contained antimony. Ho should think the pint must have contained about 20 grains. The old lady was now much better, but not yet in a fit state to appear to give evidence. He (Mr. Jones) did not consider that the prisoner was deranged in intellect, bat it might
George Rarringham, assistant to Mr. Bowers, of Tottenham-court-road, chymist, stated that at about 11 o'clock on Monday the prisoner purchased 20 grains of taAtar emetic. She said it was for her brother, who was in the habit of taking it as an emetic in some beer. He told her she might put that to a pint of beer, and one wineglassful would be a dose, allowing ten glasses to the pint.
Sergeant Hart, of tho E division, said that when bh too the prisonerinto custody he found on her a phial of antimon 'wine and a small paper containing sugar of lead.
The Prisoner.-Let the doctor examine it. There is no sugar of lead there. I am altogether innocent of the charge.
AIr. J1RDniE observed that the caeo was one demanding further inquiry. He wouldl remand the prisoner for a few days.
Mfr. HE&NRY has received the first half of a M1-noto for the poor-box from " Fred. ;" and donations of 11. Is. from it G. W. B. ;" 10s. from " E. C. W. ;" 5s, from " H P.;' and 2s. 6d. from " P. W. B."f
WEsT71iNsTER.-Mr. Edward Holmes Baldock, M.P., appeared to a summons charging him with assaulting Wlliam Hulman, a man in the employment of Mr. Spark-es Hal, bootmaker to the Queen.
Mr. Lewis, jun., appeared for the complainant, and, after stating the particuiars of the case, as proved in evidence, said that, in his opinion, the assault was wholly without provocation. The defendant best knew perhaps whether his conduct was consistent with the character of a gentleman in assaulting with his stick an unprepared and unprotected man. He (MIr. Lewis) should ask the magistrate to send the case to the sessions, as it was one in which a gentleman had offered insult and violence to a man in a humble position of life, and in which justice would not be vindicated by the gentleman putting his hand in his pocket and paying a small fine. The law knew no distinction of persons, and the fair way to put the matter was, that if the poor man had done the same to the gentleman it would have been deemed a very grave offence.
William HInlmana, the complainant, stated that he is in the employment of Mr. Sparkes Hal, of 308, Regent-street, boot and shocmiaker. He was with his master on Saturday, Feb. 14, in his dogeart, when on their arrival in Halkinstreet, Be3grave-square, they saw defendant standingtalding to Lord Newport. There was a dog by defendant's side, Which he and his employer thought was the latter's, which he had lost some time ago, and they accordingly pulled the horse up and alighted. TIhey walk-ed torards the defendant, 'when W r. Halaproaching him respectfully inquired whether he owned t-hPe dog, to which he replied that he did. Mr. Hall then asked if he would allow him to look at it, at the same timae observing, " Perhaps it may turn out it is my dog; it is very much like my dog -likewise a the collar
I don't say it is, but I want to asertain whether it is."Do:. fondant repeated that it was his dog, and told them to go about their business. They theo, ooked down towards the collar, on 'which there had been something very peculiar
nMrin. Hall's, and complainant,was pointing with his finger, wheo tdefendant gave him a tremendous blow over the knee and leg. The blow was given with great force 'and pained complainant very much, and ho was obliged t go to Dr. Parkae.. Mr. Hall, on seeing the
assault committed, aisd to the defendant that his conduct wasveungenlhemnly in strilakeg the complainanLt, and he so d earfromhimagain about it, and Lord N~o prt remarked that he deserved a good thrashing. Defenant again and again refused to give hscr,and, defendant and Lord N~ewport having separated, complainant followed the formner into the Green Park, where complainant, secliug polce-ontabe, eltedthefats o hm,when the constaol

which he refused to give. They talked about taking out a summons when defendant xaid they could do what ti3y liked, and desired them to leiTe his house.
In reply to some anestions by Mr. PAYNTER,
Complainnt saidia ho had felt great difficulty in walking in consequence of the blow, which made his mnee bleed, and took a piece of skin about an inch long off. Complainant had some stuff from a chyrmist, and went to a doctor four or five days after7ards.
Mr. Sparkes Hall having been called to confirm complainant's statement, said he called at defendant's house on his way to this court to take the summons, in order to obviate the neceesity of that proceedin if possible, when the occurrences took place before detailed He had lost his dog four months ago, and had had it two years.
Mr. PAYTTER asked the witness whether he would like a person to stop him as he was driving along, and examine his norse's mouths
Mr. Hall replied he wonld not mind pulling up for a few minutes for the purpose, or permitting a fuller examination at hi8 stables, if the person lked to caU there. Ho admitted
thatif an examination of the horse was demanded, he should expect the person to givehis name. Witness pointed to hiS chase cart, on which his name was in fulL Witness could not do that before the examination of the dog. Witness now confessed that it was very likely not his dog.
Dr. Parkes, of Great Marlborough-street, was called by complainant, but said he only found a slight bruise on his shin bone. There was no abrasion of the skin; the injury did not seem to be very severe. There was no cut, nothing but a slight briso. It could not have been a very severe
blovv. e Nvas surprised at c mmlafant coming to him so late as four or five basatrad,i e came at all
In reply to an inquiry from the defendant, Dr. Parkes said that complainant told him some one had struck him, and he wanted a certificate as to the state of his leg. He iid not ask him to prescribe, but wanted a certificate s he was going to a police-court, Witness refused to give him a certificate.
Mr. Baldock in reply to the charge, said ho was standing with his little ioy, 4 years old, talking to Lord Newport, when on a sudden he found two men walking round him, not knowing whether their attention wa directed to his Lordship or himself. Suddenly Mr. Sparkes Hall exclaimed, "lt isour dog," amndthe other, "Itis our Carlo."
e assured them in the mildest manner that it was his dog, and that he had had it five years. Tthey said they were not convinced of it, and, although he again repeated his former assurance, they sti expresstd themselves dissatisfied. He told them that their conduct was tantamount to imputing a falsehood to him, but they still pertinaciously insisted upon examiningthedog. Theycalled "Carlo, Carlo," but the dog was iminmoveable. Complainant then stooped down and took hold of the dog, when defendant, not knowing whether they were not going to steal it, gave complainant a cut across the hand with his Cane, which he now produced (a very thin stick studded with little knobs, harsly stouter than a little finger). Lord Newport told them he thought they had behaved verybadly. Complainant never askled defendant at that time for his name or address. Finding persons gathering around, Lord Newport and he separated, and complainant foHlowed him, and wanted to give him in charge, when the policeman, on being informed by the complainant that he could not show any marks of violence, nor prove that the dog or collar was his, refused to take the charge. Defendant then said, " In case of anything,here is n card," and handed it to him as described. On the tuesday foUowing complainsnt and his master came to his house, and athough assure-i by the butler that the dog had been in his master's possession three years to his knowledge, and subsequently informed by Mrs. Baldock, who was paSsing out, that they had had the dog five years; complainant and Mr. Hlla still asserted their unbeief, ahond otale abueglavice, when he desired them to ho
Lord Newport was examined, and confirmed Hr. Baldock's account of what took place in the street. He thought Mr. Baldo¢k's conduct extremely temperate, and told Complainant and the other person that 19 men oat of 20 would have thrashed them.
The butler proved that he told Mr. Hall and complainant his master had had the dog all the three years he had been in his service.
The policeman said he gave complainant his number, but forgot to leave the gentleman's card at the station that niglit, On the subsequent application of complainant at the station the name and address were given him.
MIr. PAYsTER said that it would be absurd to think of sending such a case as this to the sessions, for the assault was so very slight that it would seem the act of consulting Dr. Parkes was merely to add. something for a prosecution. People were very apt to make mistakes about dogs, and this was an unfortunate affaif of that description, resulting from which was an assault committed by the defendant, which nothing could justify in law. He, however, considered that Mr. Hall had acted in a very unjustifiable manner, and not only imputed, by his disbelief of defendant's assertion that it was his dog, almost theft and downright falsehood in the public street, but subsequently refused to give further credit to other testimony, although now free to confess he did not think it was his dog. He should have waited till the defendant had been disengaged, and should then have accosted him very differently -
is conduct had been such that there could not be two opi nons in his mind about the propriety or impropriety of it, and he could not delegate his servant to examine the do. Although defendant haa unfortunately struck a blow,, which could not be justified in law, veryfew men would have shown so much good temper under such provoking circum stances, and the question WaS, what fine should be put upon so slight an assault X Ho considered 2s. and costs, amounting in all to 4s., su'dicient.

When the repor vwas in preparation It was my desire, and I believe th aeieof ee. Others that the Information conveyed to You by it shouldhave boeen full and expeicit.

Posed upon me of publicly refuting the statements there made, which were, I think, cslculted to leave you ttnder the imprsteionv that the Dlrert=r havo the oommand of means for completing the skio.
Thkse statements were made with the knowledge that not merely are the means inadequate, but alo with thoe knowledge that there is no intetion of atimpting to complete her at prent the Idea being that the ship shouldI be got Into the water in a satai not approechieg completion, and that he iadequatcy of your mneans should eleft u- proclaimed or at least not grapplod with unti that time. It is Imaginod by there who adire thin Idea that when she Ie lauinhed the chapter of accidenits mav bring fumns to her aid, aLnd that so she may, some time or other ma'ke ferther staees of progress and eventually get io sos. Now this is meet shortsighted Policy. In order to the completion of thb ship within a reaonableI periDd ot her launch many things OURht now to be In progress, And the want of means is the only reason that can be amigned for delaying them.
With n3early £40,O already expenffed, and which cannot be rentdered profitable, except by the completion of the ship, some Plan ouchi to be at one:, Lerseod for raising ths means.
960,000, la additiou to the present available share capital when all cal'ed up, is requiste to enab!o the Directors to finish the sihip with a reasousble e-,.dpment.
To talk of a trial trip. without the'osun.and of funds to this extenk, is a delusion.
I think that the Directors ought to be restrained from spending any more mosey, or making a further call, uniess thlis sum be at once rsalsd us aid of the existing pecuniary resources. To lo Os lay-leg out money en the ship, without securing tho means of compl eting her, is no better than throwing it isto the sea,
Under the terms of the Charter It Is. I believe, in the power of th Directors to issue either debentures or to sell forfeited shares,
The fom'er would Probably be founkd thea better expedient; but,
whatever may be the plan determined upon, It ls unquestionably for~ the interest of alI eoonersed that the money should be raised now, and by a united effort on your part, I have no doubt but thiLt it can be donie, and that San early return for the property already embarked will be secured by this meansi but by no other.

PARIS, MO3IwAy, F=. 23, 6 P.M.
Letters have been received in Paris from the China Seas. They announce that on the 3d inst. thq Mandarin Syh, Governorof Shanghai, died suddenly. The news is said to have produced great fermentation among the lower clases of the population, who iccused the Europeans of his death. For two days serious disturbances were apprehended, but, owing to the presence of the French and English ships and the energy of the commandant of the Tartar troops, who co-operated with them, tranquillity was maintained. According to the latest accounts the town was tranquiL.
Private accounts from the Danube state that up to the 14th inst. the English squadron had not evacuated the Black Sea, though it was expected that orders would soon be received to that effect. Admiral Lyons's flag was still hoisted on the Roval Albert, anchored in the Bosphorns. The Ijsi
p heMajestic and Cressy had been sent to Malta for repairs. Up to thesame date the Austrian troops who occupy ths Danubian Principalitieshad made no movement to evacuate them.
Mi Thiers has definitively declined coming forward as a candidate for Rouen, or any other place. The Rouennais offered, in the most flattering manner, to secure his election to the Legislative Body, and in the letter he received from that city it was expressed that his political opinions should be neither a reason nor an obstacle to his success. M. Thiers repeated his determination to remain apart from public life. M. Thiers, there is no doubt, has expressed himself highly pleased with the quotation made from his work inthe Emperor's speech on opening the Legislative Chambera. The Emperor also paid him the complment of sending him the volume of his own copy of M. Thiers' fistory from which the passage -was taken, accompanied by a letter from His Majesty highly com;plimentary to the historian.
* For a long time Paris has not been so gay as during the present winter; nothing but receptions and balls every night. The fashion is rapidly extending, and nothing is more common than for the same persons to be present at three or four the same night. Leat is fast approaching, but great things are promised for mi-ceargme. Fancy balls are to 'oe given by Prince Jerome, at the Palais Royal, and the Princess Mathilde, at her residence in the Rue de Courcelles. The rich capitalist, M. Millauld, gave a monster banquet, a coneort, and ball, at his house last week; and last night M. Mires, the well-known banker, gave a ball, at which & great number of people attended. Temporary saloons were fitted up in the garden attached to the hotel; they were formed of gilt trellice-work, and were beautifully lighted. Most of the literary andartistic celebrities of Paris were prsent on both occasions.
Money is beginning to bemore plentiful in Paris, and both manufacturers and shopkeepers find it less difficult to procure discount. A certain activit is consequently observable in commercial quarters. As soon as the Bank of France shall find its position sufficiently favourable to discount commercial bills at 90 days, the retail dealers will begin to make purchases of the manufacturers in order to replenish their much-diminished stocks of goods. The manufacturers of Paris received a few orders last week from England. There have been likewise a few orders from the United States, and the last letters from New York give hopes from that quarter, as the stock of French produce in the Ameican markets is nearly exhausted. Theaccountsfrom the manufacturingtowns inAlsaceare notfavourable. Themanufacturers, inorder toeffect sales, areforcedto sell at prime cost. Letters from Amiens, Lyons, and Rheims state that the manufacturers in those towns are doing a fair share of business, but the complaints are universal as to the high price of the raw material. A rise in prices is maintained on all colonial produce, but particularly on coffee and sugar. Brazilian coffee is much sought for, in consequence of the 1Brazilian Goverument having raised the export duty on coffee from 9 to 11 per cent. The announcement in the Emperor's speech that the Government would amsist in establishing a Transatlantic Steampacket Service has given great satisfaction to the merchants of Paris and Lyons, who are confident that such a service will considerably benefit the export trade. Wheat continues to decline in price in the French markets, in consequence of the favourable accounts received of the growing crops. It appears further, that there has been a much greater breadth of land sown with wheat last year than during any former year. In the Paris market flour of the best marks could not find buyers at higher rates than 78f. the sack of 157 kilogranunes. The same quality brought 79f. 50c. the preceding week. The bakers are not inclined to make purchases, except at a further reduction. The flour in the reserved stores has consequently been reduced to 7,000 metrical quiintals. (The quintal is 221k lb.) Wheat of the best quality has been sold at 44f. the 120 kIlogrammes, and inferior at from 41f. to 43f. The accounts from the north of France state that the markets are abundantly supplied with wheat. There is a brisk trade going forward in the Bercy wine market. Purchasers appear to have accustomed themselves to pay 50 per cent. more than they were used to do a few years back. In the south the wine growers refuse to sell even on the most advantageous terms. They wishtohold over their stocks on hand until the quantity and quality of the next vintage are ascertained. Spirits of wine are declining in quality, being now exclusively distiled from beetroot. The price in Paris has fallen to 121f£ the hectolitre.

AUSTRIA.
(FROM OOIR OW CORESPOrcDBETT.)
VIENNA, F-m. 21.
Some month ssince you were informed that there was likely tobe a great simplification of the AusTian passport system, and it affords me extreme pleasure to be able to state that the regulations now under review will place Austria on a level with the rest of the continental States. On arriving at the frontier the passport of the traveller will be examined, but he will no longer be exposed to the loss of sleep and temper when travelling in the interior of the empire. For some time past travellers coming from Saxony and Prussia to Vienna have had little intercourse vwith police officials, but the unnecessary and injudicious severity of the passport system is stil felt in the southern parts of the empire. These allevi-
ations are a consequence of the urgent representations made to the Emperor by the Ministera for Foreign Affairs, the Interior, and Finance. For a long time General Baron Kempen, the Chief of the Police, made sturdy opposition to the Cabinet, but Zia Majesty has settled the question by attaching his signature to a draught containing the proposed changes in the passport system, which were made by a committee formed of representatives of the Supreme Police and of the Ministers for Foreign Afrairs, the Interior, and Finance.
There is reason to believe that an important fact was communicated to you by me before it occurred. Some days since you were told that Austria had addressed a very energetic note to the Sardinlan Government; but, as the document did not leave Milan sO soon as it was originaly intended, it did not reach Turin until the 13th inst. The bearer of the note was Count Psar, the Austrian Minister at Tarin, who, before he left Milan, received instruetions to break off his diplomatic relations with Sardinia if the satisfaction demanded for the insults offered by the press to the Emperor of Austria since lie had been in Italy were not given. As was said in a former letter, it is not to be feared that this Government will endeavour to obtain the required satisfaction at the point of the sword. The
treaty of Mfarch 30th is notyet properly carriedout, and Austri is not likely to neglect a matter of vital importance for a mere trifle. It is vhispere4 that th Minister of Finance is about to raise a loan of 160 millions of florins, but he will not be in a hurry to do so, Ps ho has the means in hand of defraying the expenses of the State for the next seven or eight months. There was a grand mas&uerade hero the night before last, but the music ceased at midnight because the following day was Friday. An attentive observer cannot but see that a great contest is going on here at present. The civil power would willingly keep pace with the more civilized European States, but the Church is doing all in its power to make of Austria a modern Bceotia. The official Gazette of the kingdom of Naples has never made any mention of the amnesty granted by the Ehperor, and the recent measures of Austria have given the greatest possible offence to His Majesty Eing Ferdinand II. General Baron Schunhals, who was called the *' pen" of the army of which Radetzky was the sword, is dead, and Lis was one of the first bodies buried in the new Protestant cemetery at Gratz, in Styria. In his history of the Austro-Sardinian war the late General made no mention whatever of Baron Hes-, whose strategy he did not admire.
THE STATE OF NAPLES.
(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPOND!TNT.)
NAPIES, hro. 16.
In strong contrast with an address which I sent you last week, written in a tone much to be regretted and condemned, is the one I now send you. It purports to come from the army to the King, and, though moderate, is very decided. It runs as fol. lows:-
" To TUME MAJESTY OF THE MG FEnAND II.
" Sire,-For many years your Majesty has had experience of the devotion and fidelity of your army and of its wllingnes to shed its blood for the defence of the Throne and the Monarchy when there has been occasion for it. Wherefore, now that the future is so dark and dangerous, will your 3fajety permit us to raise our voice and explain our desis ?
" Your fajesty obliged us to swear to the Constitution In 18, and desied that we should combat the exaggerated demands of some persong, froma which the total dissolution of the State might have ensued; and the army co-operated with you with zea and courage, because your Majesty protested always that In so doing there was no in. teation to abolish the statute by you spontaneously conceded, and it was believed that it might be consistently with honour and with good conscience. But now eight long years have elapsed, and a1l is tranquil in the kingdom, and nothing prevents your Majesty from finally giving new life and vigour to the Constitution already granted and sworn to. This is the desire more or less concealed of us all, ndw that the army has at length acquired a knowledge of itself.
" Let your Majesty consider what Europe must say of us, that, when another Italian army has covered itself with so much glory, we are only kept in guard over our brethren, who in every point desire what we desire, that which brings general prosperity, and henco also the prosperity of our families. Now that cries are uttered everhere in behalf of this unfortunate people must we point at their breasts our bayonets and our swords; and can such a state of thigslong continue' Your Majesty will certainly provide, according to reason and p\rudence, for the future; this, we repeat it, is the desire of the whole army, which wishes to preserve its honour and its conscience, but does not think it can do so so long as your Majesty refuses to satisfy the Icommon desire."THE ARMY."
This is the second time, I am informed, that the address has been circulated, and it, together with the strict scrutiny and the consequent punishments which have been inflicted, has been productive of serious effects on the spirit of the army. I think it a dangerous sign that certain general officers should even be suspected, and that it should have been a matter of discussion whether it would not be well to make domiciliary ViSits in their houses. I send you a list of the 74 prisoners said to have been pardoned, and from the terms of punishment annexed you will perceive how political offences are visted in this country; and such offencesl Of these some Were a few days since still in prison, and one at least has his punishment commuted to 20 years in irons. This is a Neapolitan amnesty ! No wonder that an Autrian amnesty cannot be ublished here. All prisoners of any note are At& i confinement. Pica, Seniavoni, Nisco and others made a demand for grazia on ristmas-eve, but still pine in Montesarchio without any promise. Yet it has been much boasted that all who applied for grazia would have it. I believe that it was wished at one time to use the Argentine Treaty as a net, and at one swoop carry off all but the true worshippers. Among the detenuti are men of education and property, who have been in confinement for upwards of a month without having been interrogated. Where I can be proved to be in error I will be the first to acknowledge it; meanwhile I know no other duty than of reporting what appears to me to be true. I have perceived that many journals state that Bentivenga, who was shot recently at Palermo, was murdered, and that he was regarded as a martyr. I have never, however, seen the real reasons, which are of a legai character, stated. It appears, then, that the Grand Criminal Court, at the suggestion of the Government, declared its incompetency to try the Baron, and sent the cause for trial before a court-martial. The accused, however, seeing the object of the move, appealed to the Supreme Court. Notwithstanding this, and while the appeal was still pending, the court-martial tried, condemned, and shot Bentivenga. The advocates of the accused then made a demand that the Supreme Court should declare non esservi 1ngo a deliberare on the appeal, in consequence of the execution of the appellant. The legal declaration was made, and is said to have given great offence at Naples.
THE PERSIAN QuESTION.
The Nord of Monday publishes the following despatch, dated Paris, Sunday evening, 22d inst. We give it with due reserve -
"T he Persian difficulty is terminated. A settlement has taken place between England and Persia.
"The conditions were agreed upon on Friday last. It is impossible to send them all, but one of
them is, that England is to have consuls in all the I towns where there is a Russian consul."
THE EAST.
Advices from Constantinople have been received to the 16th inst.
Rifaat Pasha is dead. He leaves a fortune of 25 000,000 piastres.
Wes;s. Baltazzi have granted a loan of 1O0,000,0OO piastres to the Porte.
Eaboulyi Effendi has been proposed for President of the Divan ad hoc, which is to meet at Jassy. Kiamil Bey is designated to fill the same office at Bucharest.
Admiral Lyons had officially announced his proximate departure. Two vessels had a1ready left for Malta.
A new landing of Russian troops has taken place at Balfruck, on the shore of the Caspian Sea. It is reported that warlike stores have been forwarded in the direction of Teheran.
Advices from Athens of the 14th state that the Senate had rejected the financial arrangement concerted with the protecting Powers. The M*insters having deliberated thereon communicated the opposition of the Senate to the representatives of those Powers.

ITumday Evening
The quotation of gold at Paris is about 6 Der mile premium, and the short exchange on Iono
is 25.224 per 1l. sterling. On comparing these ras with the English Mint price of 31. 17s; 10j e ounce for standard golJ, it appears that gol is nearly 4-40ths per cent. dearer in Paris thanin London.
By advices from Hamburg the price of gold is 424 per mark, and the short exchange on London is 1S.*k per 11. sterling. Standard gold at the English Mtint price is therefore at about the lame value in Hamburg and in London.
The course of exchange at New York on london for bills at 60 days' sight is 108q per cent., which, when compared with the Mint par between the two countines, shows that the exchange is against Eng-. land; but, after makuing allowance for charges of transport and difference of interest, the present rate leaves no profit on the transmission of gold either way between England and America.
The success of the Government in the House of Commons last night, coupled with the further rise on the Paris Bourse and the generally favourable appearance of the continental money-markets, caused the English funds to open this morning with a tendency to improvement. This, however, was checked by a continued increase in the demand for discounts and advances, and the market closed at only a fractional advance on yesterday's prices, although with a perceptible revival In tone. A partial reaction on the Paris Bourse was announced before the termination of business. Consols for money, which left off last evening at 931, were first quoted 93i to J. From this they went to 94, but the final transactions were at 93a to i for money and 93p to 94 for the 5th of Mxfarch. Forthe new account on the 8th of Aprilt he closing qiaotation was 941 to J. Bank Stock remained at 21& to 220; Reduced, 94 to Ji; New Three per Cents., 94i to j; India Stock, 219 to 222; Exrhequer-boids, 98j to i; India-bonds, Is. discount to 2s. premium; and Exchequer-bills, pax to 3s. premium.
In the Stock Exchange to-day 6 per cent. was freely paid forloans on Government recurities, and in the discount-market and at the Bank the demand was extremely active. The pressure was partly consequent upon the requiraments for the purchase of the 290,0001. of gold broug,ht by the Ocean Chief, the whole of which has been taken for tho Continent. Part will be despatched to t a Bank of France, but there has been a consideiA le O'ewan 1! for Spain and Portugal. To Spai. M. 7. r ha to meake large remittanlces on accorunt of b.is _-;

comprised-Brazilian Four-and-a-Half per OeL .

In the foreign exchanges the rates generally were higher than last post.
The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 69f. 90c. for money and 70f. 5c. for the end of the month, showing a reaction of a quarter per cent.
A report that a newAustrianloan is in contemplation was formally contradicted from Vienna this morning.
It is stated that the rates have been announced at which the shares of the Russian railway scheme are to be issued in the varioue European markets. At Amsterdam the share is to represent 236 guilders, equal to 607f.; at Berlin itis to be for 134 dollars, equal to 603f.; and in London it is to be for 201., equal to 606f. As the issue at Paris is to be at the rate of 500f.per share, an advantage is thus given to French subscribers over all others, and the result would be that the shares might stand apparently at 6f. or 7f. premium in Paris, although the sum obtainable for them would he equal only to the par price at London or Amsterdam.
The shipping returns of the Board of Trade for the past year have been issued, and present results in strict conformity with those of the declared value of our exportations. The general augmentation in the employment of tonnage, as compared with 1855, appears to have been more than 16 per cent.; and the competition of foreign vessels with British has resulted ln an increasing prefereuce for the latter. While the employment of British vessels has increased to the extent of 19 per cent., that of United States' vessels has Increased only 15 per cent., and that of other countries only 11 per cent. Subjoined are the leading figures:-
Entered inward-
With regard to the coasting trade the tonnage entered inward was 12,808,5gO in the year 1854, 12,190,002 in 1855, and 12,643,847 (including 305 foreign vessels of an aggregate burden of 52,691 tons) in 1856. The clearances outward were 13,9,501 in 1854, 13,084,475 in 1855, and 13,430,678(including 139foreignvessels of an aggregateburden of 22,559 tons) in 1856. The total employment of foreign tonnage in the coasting trade, which was 89,252 tonsin 1855, was only 75,250 tons in 1856.
The Excise statements for the past year have also been phublished. The following table exhibits the quanies of each article charged with duty in the
nited Kingdomduring that period as compared wih 1855. There has been a considerable increase under each head, except hops:-

The weekly reviews from the Amsterdam and Rotterdam Produce-markets state that business has becomo more animated, and that there has been a corresponding advance in Erces. All the principal articles have improve , with an increased speculative demand. Sugar, tea, coffee, and cotton have been more extensively operated in, and the best descriptions have brought higher quotations. There has been great activity in the leather trade, owing to augmented piirchases. The letters from Rouen speak of greater briskness, the engagements for the spring trade having increased.
At a meeting of the General Steam Navigation Company held to-day the dividend declared was 14s. per share (equal to 1.0 per cenLt, per annum), with a bonus of 2s. 6d, per share free of income-
At a meeting to-day of the committee appoirLted by the tea trade to concert measures for obtaining a settlement of the duties it was unanimously areed that a deputation should wait upon Lord JohnRussell, requesting him to place an amendment on the books of the House of Commons, proposing a fixed duty of Is. 4d. for three years, then to be reduced to ls., instead of the sliding scale of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
The following note explains that there has never been any connexion between the firn of Vuros, Brothers, whose failure was announced yesterday, and Sphilizzi and Vuros. The contrary impresmion,
which~prevailed among the- principal bankers, was| sitrezlgthened, perhaps, by the only name of Vuros wvhich appears in the 07Londo Comms,.da Directora j being accompanied by a reference to Sehiiizri ana Vuros:-
" Sir,-In the City Artole ia your paper of this date tihre is a serious misstatement as regards our f=, which we beg you immediately to correct.

At the Court nf eankruptcy to-day it vaa mentioned that a further small dividend will be declared under the estate of Mewssrs. hitmore, Wells, and Co., bankers who failed in 1841. The amount already paid to gcreditors bas been 14s. 5d. in thepound.

State Of Trade.
STATB OF TRADR.
MANlCESTER, FEB. 24.
The yarn-market has been flat, but spinners have mostly remained very firm to their last quotations. The few operations that have taken place are mostly confined to the home trade and to exports for Germany. Much the same is reported of the cloth-market, the business being very limited, but without cbangein prices. The holders of cloths suited to the Indi market are still unable to findpurchasers at anything like remunerative rates, and the little done has been mostly confiaed to sales by parties seeking relief from stocks2 and at rather easier prices. There has been rather more inquiry for longclothiand T-cloths, but in this branch, as lso in yarns sited to the Mediterranean, there has been less business than might have been expected in consequencoe of the uneasiness and gloonm occanioed by tlte stoppage of several Greek houses, which have been involved in diaoulties through the recent failure of a london house (Qessr Franghiada and Sons) In the corn trade. Four houses are reported as having stopped here, the liabilities of one of these concerns being named at

IXOTINGHZ lBcs, 24.
The lace trade, sa the season advances, continues to improve, butlirdly to the extent that was anticipated. The home trade, howrever, is becoming more active, and purchasers for that market arenow operating. There is also a fair amount of business doing in the foreign trade. Mfaterial continues excedingly hih, without any prospect of a
The demand for hosiery, more particularly for home consumption, is active. The hosiery trade has for a long time past oeen brisk, and present appearances sugar well for the futare.
LEICESTER, FEB. 24.
The hosiery trade continues quiet. There are some orders for cotton gcods ouhnnhd, and, in faot, in these articles there has been for some time past a fair business doing. There
are also some orders tor theAmerican market on hand. Wools continue very dear, and worsted yarns are extremely high.
TLRDS, FEB. 24.
At the Cloth-halls this morning the attendance of both merchants and manufacturers has only been moderate, and the transactions have been upon a less scale than lately. The quiet tone, however, has not arisen from anyimportant change in the state of trade, but rather from a d7esire which is manifested to see how prices rule at the wool sales, which commence in London to-morrow (Thursday)
HlUD)DEIISFIELD, FXB. 24.
The cloth-market in this town to-day has been rather better than usul. There were a good many buyers from London and other places in attendance, who made purchases pretty freely, In anticipAtion of an advance in wooL Goods of new patterns were readily.bought. In wool prices are steady, and little variation has occurred.
