GEORGI STEPHBNSON.* We may congratulate all true Englishmen that an omieion has been repaired in this instance which we have to deplore in some others, and that the failure to preserve for us a biography of James Watt has not been imitated in the case of George Stephenson. It is a singular fate that some of the world's greatest benefactors should thus pass from the world with their history comparatively unnoticed; but so it has been continually, and the claims of lineage or the privilege 'which inherits have been constantly pre1erred to those of the genius wvhich creates. In times verging on mythology, even in classical Greece, the records and traditions of the Hellenic peerage are at least definite, if they are not very reLiable; while the authors of the useful arts and of civil society,with the exception of their names, are mostly shrouded in obscurity. How much more we know of Lords Ajax and Achilles than, for example, of Triptolemus,-of the men who ate corn than of the man who first drove a furrow for its reception I In the middle ages, again, how much less of thosewho invented gunpowder and the mariner's compass than of those who generaUy employed either, to a mischievous purpose. Thatthia distinction shouldstill pursue the inventors of our days is less rational and intelligible, and we rightly rejoice when the claims of any of them are vindicated, when from the hidden company of the Brindleys and Watts, men risen from the ranks to do world-wide service, and incidentally to be the architecta of their country's later greatness, we can obtain the authentic history of such a creator as George Stephenson. It is not too much to say, that by Mr. Smiles, who has performed this office with eminent success, a considerable void is filled up in the page of modern history. We see the vast proportions of our modern achievements and the epic story of this age of iron more than half comprised in the feats of its strongest andmostsuccessfulworker. The worker himself, with his noble simplicity and energy, his zeal for his kind, his native born gentleless and indomitable tenacity, would probably have been eminent in any age or condition of society, but, in virtue of his actual achievements and the obstacles he surmounted, of his strtggles and triumphs, we may designate him a hero, and ask in defence of this arbitrary title what real conditions of heroism were there wanting ? Mr. Smiles has shown that he, at all events, is aware of the heroic and revolutionary aspects of his subject. He is conversant with the history of railways, and he perceives its relations to other history of which much has yet to be written, and some to be acted. He may even be open on this account to the charge of excursiveness, and may have fallen into the error of attempting to connect together the pretensions of personages so different as Robert Stephenson and his father. But at least in what he has written of the earlier and greater of the two he has united comprehensiveness with good taste as a narrator; so that George Stephenson's career is before us from the cradle to the grave, and we should not think that much could be added to its illustration. At all events, with a few exceptions, in which we trust to other sources, it is upon Mr. Smiles that we rely for the following memnorable particulars. George Stephenson was born on the 9th of June, 1781, in the colliery village of Wylam, about eight miles to the west of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, amid slag and cinders, in an ordinary labourer's cottage, with unplastered walls, bare rafters, and floor of clay. His father, " Old Bob," was the worthy descendant of an ancient and honourable line of working men, and his mother, Mabel, was "a'rale canny body ;" but, the wages of the former as a fireman amounting to no more than 12s. a-week, scbooling for George was out of the question, and he was taken by his father birdnesting or told stories aboutSindbad andRobinson Crusoe as a substitute. His interest in birds'nests neverlefthim to his dying day, nor was the serious businew of his life less identified with the sights of his childhood. Before the cottage door in which he was born there ran a tram-road, on which the coal wagons were then dragged by horses from the pit to the loading quay. Half the destiny of an age was latent in its rails, to be evolved hereafter by the very boy who, after his own probation was over, had to keep his younger brothers and sisters out of the way of the horses. Thus eight years passed, when the famiy removed to Dewley-burn, and George, to his great joy, was elevated to the post of cowboy to a neighbouring farmer at the wage of twopence a-day, and matriculated definitely for his future career of labour. At first, however, he had leisure to develope his tastes and accomplishments. He still spent much time in birdnesting, also in making whistles out of reeds and scrannel straws, and erecting Lilliputian mills in the little water-streams that ran into the Dewley Bog. There can be no doubt that he indicated thus early that bent which is termed a mechanical genius. His favourite amusement, and this deserves to be noted, was the erection of dcay engines, in conjunction with a certain Tom Tholoway. The boys found the clay for their enges in the adjoining bog, and the hemlock which grew about supplied them with abundance of imaginary steampipes. The place is still pointed out "just aboon the cut end," as the people of the hamlet deEcribe it, where the future engineer made his first essays in modelling. With respect to these Mr. Smiles very aptly recalls the similar stories told about the boyish days of Smeaton. But a rise in life came with which these occupations were hardly compatible, for George passed from a pastoral to an agricultural sphere, doubling bis wages by undertaking to hoe turnips. Then he was taken on at the colliery as a " picker," at 6d. a-day, whence he was advanced to be driver of the ginhorse at 8d.; and there are those who still remember him in that capacity as a "grit bare-legged laddie," wlhom they describe as " quick-witted and full of fun and tricks." He himself had some misgivings as to bis physical dimensions, and was wont to hide himself when the owner of the colliery went round, lest he should be thoughtttoo little a boy to earn his small wages. His soul, like the militiaman of Hogarth, was higher than his inches, and his fixed ambition was to be an engineman. Great, therefore, was his exultation when at about 14 years of age, he was appointed fireman at the wage of Is. a-day. From this point his fortunes took him from one pit to another, and procured him rising wages with his risiDg stature. At Throelley-bridge when advanced to 12s. a-week, " I am now," said he, " a made man for life." At 17 he shot ahead of old Bob himself,being made an engineman or plugman, while the latter remanined a fireman. He soon studied and mastered the working of his engine, and it became a sort of pet with him. Our readers will recall Boz's description of the man who made a companion of the fire he tended when they read that the engine Stephenson watehed exerted over him a species of fasination. His greatest privilege was to find some one who could read to him by the engine fire out of any book or stray newspaper which found its way into the colliery. Thus he heard that the Egyptians hatched birds' eggs by artificial heat, and endeavoured to do the same In his engine-house. Also, he learnt that the wonderful engines of Watt and Boulton were to be found described in books, and with the object of mastering these books, though a grown man, he went to a night-school at 3d. a-week to learn his letters. For 4d. a-week he included "figuring," while at the pit he leant the art of rakeing an engine though not without opposition from a fellow-wor;;nan. Brakeing an engine wa one of the highest departments of colliery labour, and when Stephenson was appointed brakesman at the Dolly Pit and earned nearly 11. per week he made overtures to one Fanny Henderson, a pretty farm servant, to share it. At this time, during his leisure hours, he added to his income by making and mending the shoes of his fellow-workmen; and on one occasion he was favoured with the shoes of his sweetheart to sole. Here his heart was in the stitches and he lingered over his task, carrying the shoes about with him, looking at them from time to time, and exclaiming, " what a capital job he had made of thenm." And a capital job it proved, for he: was shortly married to the fair owner, who made him an excellent wife, and brought comfort as her dowry to the cottage which he took for her on Willington Quay. Here his only son Robert was born on the ]6th of December, 1803, and his strong soul was greatly cheered by these blessings of his married state. At this point some material particulars are to be noted, that George was never to be seen "the worse for drink," that he -was continuing to save money, that he greatly enjoyed trials of strength and aoilitr with his fellow-workmen, and on one occasion licked the bully of the colliery in a pitched * T7W Life of Ceorge&ehenson, Bailway Etsinccr, By 2vamuo = m le#, M y, 18Fs7, battle, though this was his first and last fight of this description. He. was simultaneously preparing for his life-battle in a very different fashion, by modelling experimental machines on winter evenings by the side of his wife; and at the. same time he even occupied himself a good deal, as. so many other inventors have occupied themselvea before him, with attempts to discover the perpetual motion. He did not, indeed, neglect labours more practical and immediately profitable. From mending shoes he proceeded to making them, and thence to making shoe lasts, in which he was expert, and drove a good trade. Prom cleaning and repairing his own clock he also became one of the. most famous clock-doctors in the neighbourhood. He was thus prospering and happy till calamity overtook him, and, to his lasting sorrow, he lost his | fair partner. Soon afterwards he removed for an interval to Scotland, on the ihvitation of the owners of a colliery, to superintend an engine they were erecting. On his return he found his father reduced to blindness by an accident, and consequently to poverty. So he paid his father's debts, cheerfully undertook the support of him and his mother, and discharged this filial duty towards them until their death. At this time (1807-8), in consequence of the war and all its heavy burdens, the condition of the working classes was very discouraging. and George could not escape the general despoudency. Moreover, he was drawn for the militia, and nearly the whole of his hard-won earnings were swept away at a stroke. Thereupon he contemplated the idea of emigrating to the United States, and a sore and sorrowful forecast he took of his fortunes. " You know," saidhe, "t he road from my house at the West Moor to. Killing, worth. I remember when I went, eloDg that road I wept bitterly, for I knew not where my lot would be cast." At length he elected to stay, and by mending clocks and watches, or cutting out the pitmen'B clothes after his labour was done, he not only sustained the pressure of thetimes, butproeured the coveted means of educating his son. i s said that there are clothes still worn at Killingworth whichhavebeenmade after "Geordy Steevie's cat." Soon afterwarda he signalied himself by curing a wheezy engine, at which "all the engineers of the neighbourhood were tried, as well as Orowther of the Ouseburn, but they were clean bet." IHe got 101. for this job, as well as the provincial glory of beating Crowther of the Oaseburn, aad from this day his services as an engineer came into request. In 1814, by dint of extra labours, to which the education of his son was still the prime motive, he had accumulated 1001. in guineas, which he sold to the Jews to the further increase of his little capital. Still he waa striving and devising in various ways, when, in 1812, he was appointed enginewright at Kiilhlngworth, at. the salary of 100I. ayea;r. Here we approach hisTexperimaenta with the locomotive, and his biographer precedes them with a chapter in which he trnoes the history of the railways on which it was to run. Wooden rails, it appears, were first laid down by Mr. Beaumont for the service of his coalpits, as early as 1602. Roger North describes them; so does Arthur Young a century later. The first iron rails are supposed to have been laid down at Whitehaven in 1738. French travellers canle and saw them with admiration; but in one instance the colliers themselves inaugurated them with a riot. In 1800, Benjamin Outram using stone props instead of timber for sUpporting the ends and joinings of the rails, they became known as " Outram, or ' tram' roads." The canal intereats were then looking on somewhat uneasily. "We shall do well enough," said the Dake of Bridgewater to Lord Kenyon, "If we can keep clear of these - tramroads; there's mischief in them." So long, however, as the railway waggons were drawn by horses there was no reason for apprehension, for the infinitely greater load which a horee can drsw upon a canal, with the inferences drawn by Arago in his famous. report of 1838, Is conclusive upon this question. On the question of another tractive power we need not go beyond the clear statement of Mr. Smiles. From Solomon Caus, the martyr of the Bicetre, through the Cornishman Savory, through Watt, Moore, Evans, Synington, Murdoch, whose machine the pastor of the parish believed to be the evil one in propr.Q persond; through Thomas, Anderson, Trevo. thick,and othersthe locomotive, is derived, but the]ast appears first to have conceived theplan of applying his engine to traveling on railroads, and, afterfrightening a Devonshire toll-keeper with his " dragon," as it was called, and inducing him to forego all thoughts of taking toll of " the devil," Trevethic actually constructed an improved locomotive to run on the Merthyr Tydvil Railway in SouthWales. Mr. Smilea describes what it was, and that it was practicaUy a failure. Then he discusses the attempts of Blenkinsop, and of the Chapmans of Newcastle, in the same direction, and the endeavours of Mr. Blackett in 1812 on the very Wylam waggon-way which ran by the home of Stephenson's childhood. The " Black Billy" of Mr. Blackiett was the portent of the reighbouJrhood, but Mr. Blackett proved at least that the adhesion of wheels to smooth rails was sufficient to enable them to propel the machine without slipping, and so dispelled a fallacy which had previously prevailed. But the importance of tmrning the steamblast into the chimney, which was "the very life blood of the locomotive engine," was first clearly discerned by George Stephenson. Stephenson froman earlyperiod wasquite sanguine as to the " traveUing engine." He had inspected the " Black BiUy " and Blenkinsop's Leeds engine, and at length he himself brought the subject beforeLord Ravensworth, the principal proprietor of Killingworth Colliery. Lord Rlavensworth advanced money, and an engine was made which was called "My Lord." It was the most successful working engine that had yet been constructed, and succeeded in drawing thirty tons' weight at four miles an hour. Still its economy was questionable, for it proved only that steam power and horse power were on a par in point of cost, while its speed was not beyond that of a horse's walk. But at this point Stephenson's perseverance turned the decision of the issue. His adoption of the steam blast in the chimney imparted velocity to the smoke, and so increased the ascending current of air that the power of the engine became more than doubled. Observing numerous other defects in its construction, Stephenson determined to make another engine, and this, which was constructed in 1815, was found to answer extremely welL Of this second engine, says Mr. Smiles, who describes its peculiarities, " it may, in fact, be regarded as the type of the present locomotive." As an episode in his career of usefulness, it was nearly about the same time that he invented and bro~ught into use the "Geordy" safety lamp. Killingworth Colliery was liable to explosions, and while Stephenson was employed aS brakesman at West Moor several such had occurred of the most serious character. In 1805 ten persons were killed while he was working at the mouth of the pit, and the account of this accident, which 30 years afterwards he gave to the House of Commons, shows the impression which at the time it made upon his mind. Another explosion occurred In 1809 by which 12 persons suffered, and in 1812, in a neighbouring pit, no fewer than S0 men and boys were suffocated or burnt to death. Some pro. tection against these accidents was still more urgently reuired in a colliery Eo extensive as lKilliurwortla where there were nearly 160 miles of gallery exoava tion. Yet here it happened that one day in the year 1814 a workman hurried into Stephenson's cottage with information that the deepeet Imain in the colliery was on fire. In the midst of a terrorstricken crowd of women and children he rushed to tho pit's mouth, and instantly, to their breathless amazement, he descended. Calling upon six of the men to follow him, in whonf such a leader at such a moment could alone have inspired confidence, he reached the bottom of the pit, and in the midst of the tumult directed the building of a waU at the entrance of the main, by which the atmospheric air was excluded, the fire extinguished, many of the people were saved from death, and the mine was preserved. Some days later, when seeking out the bodies of those who had perished, he was asked by a fellow-workman, " Could nothing be done to prevent such awful occurrences 7" Stephenson replied that he thought something might be done. " Then," said the former, " the sooner you start the better, for the price of coalmining now is pitmen's lives." Upon this he set to work to construct a lamp which should burn and give forth suffirient light to guide the miner in his underground labours, without communicating flame to the iLflaamable gas which accumulated in certain parts of the pit. Sir Humphry Davy, then also in the zenith of his reputation, was requested by some gentlemen of Sunderland to turn his attention to the same subject; but before the results of his investigation could be published Stephenaon hid already praotivcdly solyed, the qtLestion of the safety lamp. The comrse of his ez peinents Is described&at length - and;thogh-prac. ticay, smuc,ssful, they weres'onducteodempirically. i Stephenson's scientific knowledge was then meagre, and he had no teachers; in fact, atr this moment he was but one step removed from the grade of a manual labourer. Bat he mastered the difficalty, and when, lamp in hand, he advanced alone to test its sufficiency, confident of his principle and staking his life on the issue, we may fairly aseribe to him the attributes of heroism. The nerve and courage which carry a man up to the cannon's mouth could not be more intrepid and manly,-probably they afe not so exacting an impulse as the resolution of that single workman in his solitary walk through the hazardous mine. Stephenson's lamp; like his true heart, sustained the test, and after some improvements his third lamp, as finally designed by birn, was in the hands of the manufacturer on the 24th of November,-before he had heard of Sir Humphry Davy's experiments or of the lamp which that gentleman proposed to construcat. To this day it is in regulax use in the Eillingworth colienes under, the name of the " Geord'y" lamp as distinguished from the "Davy," and the Kllingworth pitmen have expressed to the biographer their decided 'preference for the former. No accident is known to have arisen from its use since its intioduction, and Stephenson's own confidence in it is shown to have never abated. Of -course there was a controversy as to priority, &c., in which Sir Humphry was supported by his large scientific connexion, and the " colliery enginewright" had a foretaste from the Royal Society of the battle he had afterwards to fight with the civil engineers. So long as it was. proposed to: reward Sir EHumphry Davy for " the invention of his safetf-lamp " no objection could be taken, but when.a the subsoriptioni. was described as a reward for IIhis invention of the safety-lamp" the case was altered, and Stephenson's friends proceeded to assert his claims. Then meetings wrer held and controversial documents issued, which Mr. Smiles very clearly,, and, we asaume, fairly analyzes. 1,000g. was collected for Stephenson, and presented to him with a silver tankard at a public dinner; and Sir Humphry Davy, wounded in his egotism and vanity-taA4tmne animis ceZestibus iro-privately grumbled and gnahedl his teeth. The colliery enginewright, however, had a far greater triumph to boast of. He had constructed the first successful locomotive, and to the history of this and its sucessors we return. He had remained in the field when its other inventors and impiovera had abandoned it in despair, and he had done this in virtue of a perseverance which was almost like an inspiration. He was looked updA as an enthu- siast, and men shook their heads at his creature, predicting " a terrible blow-up some day; " but he was thoroughly confident. He even went so far as to say that it would supersede every other tractive power. His imagination warmed into metaphor, and he apoke of the rail and wheel as " man and vnife." For the details of his experiments and improvements, made at this time, when there was a great deficiency of skied mehaniec ,we have no sufficient space. Mr. Smiles describes his "steam springs," his experiments, with a dynanometer of his own construction, and the means by which he came to the conclusion that to apply steam power to the purpose of traveUing on ommon roads was a waste of money, time, and ingenuity. Herein he was less of an enthusiast than the " practical' men of his generation. He probed his princi2la and he adhered to it. Oneo on the raUs he stuck to them, and, like one of his own engines In force and tenacity, he went straight to his terminus. AB yet his locomotives, though in daily use for many years on the Kilhingworth Railway, excited comparatively little interest except in the neighbourhood. KiUingworth lay far from London, the centre of scientific life in England; it was visited by no savans or scientific men who might have called attention to its great sight. But there were, nevertheless, some practical and public-spirited persons at the time who had arrived, at least, at a sense .of the importancee of railways. Among the most prominent of these were William James, of West Bromwich, and Edward Pease, of Darlington, and James had this fortune,-if he did not discover the locomotive, he did what was the next best thing, he discovered George Stephenson. He had fortune and position, was extensively employed as a land agent, and as early as 1803 had contemplated the projection of a railway between Literpool and M alchester. He even went to Camborne, in Cornwall, to see Trevethick on the subject. He set on foot project after project, in some of which he embodied proposals to use the improved locomotive of Northumberland. People said Mr. James was stark mad, and his friends began to look upon him with tuspicion. At length the Stockton and Darlington scheme was projected by Edward Pease, who at first contemplated only a horse tramroad, but eventually became a convert to George Stephenson's improvement. Sti the conveyance of passengers was not even dreamt of on "the Quaker's line," as it was called. Mr. Pease wanted a transit for oals, and the Bill for this purpose was at firat thrown out by the influence of the Duke of Cleveland, because it passed near one of his fox covers. Eventually the immunity of the fox cover was assured by a change of route, and the Bill was passed. The first Stockton and Darlington Railway Act received the Royal assent on the 19th of April, 1821. We ought to mention that Thomas Gray, of Nottingham, was at the same time turning his thouzghts with great urgeny in the direction of similar constructions. In the meantime Stephenson had constructed another colliery line, called the Hetton Railway, about eight miles in length, and by the 18th of November, 1822, there were five of his locomotives at work on it, under the direction of his brother Robert. About the middle of the year 1821 James, having heard of Stephenson's engines, determined to go downto Killingworth to inspect them in person. Stephenson he did not see, but he examined his locomotive at work, and saw at a glance the magni- ficent uses to which it might be applied. " Eere," said he, "is an engiue that will before long effect a complete revolution in society. " Re turning to Moreton-in-the-Marsh he wrote to Lort, Stephenson's partner in the patent, to a similar effect; and then, at Lort's invitation, he again visited Killing- worth, and had an interview with Stephenson himself. He and his sons had a ride either on or behind the locomotive, to the terror of the lads, and James, after it was over, expressed his opinion to Lort that Stephenson was "t he greatest practical genius of the age," an d that " if he developed the full powers of that engine his fame in the world would rank equal to that of Watt." Thus did James perform the invaluable office of stoker to the secret fire in Stephenson's breast. HIe also got himself associated in the patent, and early in 1822 procured a survey of a line between Liverpool and Manchester. This line was, indeed, indicated fo him by the necessity which existed for an acceleration of the traffic between these two points. IJp to this time the Duke of Bridgewater's canal and the Irwell and Mersey navigation had principally supplied their means of transport; hut the increasing demands of their trade outstripped these faciities. Cotton lay at Liverpool for weeks together waiting to be removed, and Mr. Huskisson, in the House of Commons, spoke of these delaysas "ruinous." Thus Birnam-wood was moving towards Dunsinane, and the apprehension of the old Duke of Bridgewater were about to be realized. Towards the end of 1821 Stephenson had himself visited Mr. Pease, on the ground of his experience in railways, as soon as he had heard of the passing of the Stockton and Darlington Act. He had an honest sensible look about him, which Mr. Pease said he liked. He described himself as " only the enginewright at Killingworth; that's what he was." But Mr. Pease, whose calculations were based on the employment of horsepowver, was scarcely prepared for the bold assertion made by his visitor that his locomotive was worth 50 horses. In answer, however, to the invitation to " come and see what my Blucher can do," he pro- mised that he would, and eventually he went. But previously to this he had engaged the services of Stephenson to suggest Improvements or deviations in the line of the proposed railway. Then he came toKillingworth, saw, andwasovorcome, and in 1823, in preparing his amended Act, at Stephenson's request, he had a clause inserted taking power to work the railway by means of locomotive engines, and to employ them f w the haulage of passengers as well as of merchandise. The Duke of Cleveland, &c., strove against him again, but this time ineffectually. Thereupon Stephenson was regularly appointed the Icompany's engineer at °001. per annum, and he removed with his family from Killingworth to Dariippgton. Then. tfo oisryey for th« improved line wonlt for- I i i I i I I I I I ward satisfactorily, though railway surveying in tbose days was slowrandI-deliberate work.-George Stephenson, thus engaged, used to start early in.tho morning in top-boots and breeches,taking with him in his capacious pocket a piece of rw ..bacon and a hunch of bread, with which about midday he would enter a cottage or fatmhouse on'the line of his i survey, and ask leave to have his bit of bacon fried. Generally he wasenabled to obtain the addition of some eggs and a drink-of milk, by the help of which and a hearty appetite he contrived to make a good dinner. The farming people along the line of the proposed railway soon cMne to know and welcome him, for he was always full of gay and homely conversation. He petted and played With their children, and when the day's work was over he would drop in at Mr. Pease's, where on one occasion he instructed that gentleman's daughters in the art of embroidery. "You will wonder," said he to the young ladies, "how I learnt it. When I was a brakeaman at Killingworth I learnt the art of embroidery while working the pitmea's buttonholes by the engine fire at nights." His convesation was thus full of all sorts of experience, and there was a dash of speculativeness in his remarks which gave it a character of orignality. His frank and genuine nature conciliated general esteem, and wherever he went hiis capacities asld deportment made his way comparatively easy. His fundamental honesty was showuhere, as on many other ocesaions, by his advice to Mfr Pease to lay down wrought-iron rails. He was hlmnelf ina terested in the patent for cast-iron rails, but as he stated, "although it would put 6001. in my pocket to specify my own patent rails, i cannot do so after the experience which I have had." The gauge of the line was. determined by the gauge of the wheels of the common vehicles of the eountry which were firrt used on the tramroads, whence the breadth of 4 feet Bi incbes was originally adopted. Thuil the early coal tramroads Fettled the national gia*0 of British railways without trouble, experiment, or qUestion. Their capacity to accommodate passengers wa~ amply proved on the opening Or the Stockton atad Darlington line on the 27th of September, 1825. :By the time its first train reached Stockton therie were about 600 persons in the train or hanging on. to the waggons, which must have gone at a safe and steady pace of from four to six miles an hour from Darlington. The arrival at Stockton excited deep interest and admiration, but it had yet to be proved that passengers would be permanently attracted. [n the fLrst instanne an old stage coach, called the " Queen Charlotte," was purchased at a b,rgaia, .nd mounted on a wooden frame. The name of the 3oach was to be altered, and Stephenson was asked what they should call her. "The Expurriment," aid he, in his strong Northumbrian tongue; and Lhe eoach was renamed the Experiment accordingly. 'his was the entire passenger stock of the Stockton mnd Darlington line on the day of its openimg, and .or some time afterwards. But soon the passenger, ike the goods traffic, exceeded the expectations of ;he projectors; people crowded on the coach wherever they Co d get a footing, so that, as an bserver of the time remarked, "When they lescend and begin to separate it looks like the dismissal of a small congregation." It was woon necessary to add other coaches, and at Length regular passenger trains, though this was not til after sirAilar trains had been established by the Liverpool and Manchester. Tha Stockton mnd Darlington was, however, the first reaUy public highway of the kind opened for traffic in England. One of its results was the creation of the town of biddlesborough-on-Tees, and another the construeRon of a handsome gold watch, bearing this inscription :-" Esteem and gratitude; from George Stephenson to Edward Pease." The old gentleman was reasonably proud of the offering, but we should more reasonably have expected a similar inscription on the part of Edwazrd Pease to George Stephenson. While the works of the Stockton and Darllngton iine were in progress Stephenson conei}ved the design of an establishment at Newcastle for the manufacture of locomotive engines. Hitherto he had had to rely on ordinary and unskilled mechanies, and he felt the want of efficient helpers. AIso he saw his way doubtless to a remunerative investment. The thousand pounds which the coalowners had presented to him for his safety lamp were untouched. MIr. Pease and John Richardson consented to embark 5001. each in addition, and the nucleus of the gigantic establishment which afterwards arose in Forth-street was formed, and active operations commenced there early in 1824. Stephenson's factory, in short, became a school or college, in which the locomotive workmen of the kingdom were trained, and many of the most celebrated engineers of Europe, America, and India acquired their best practical knowledge in its workshops. Dr. Lardner, writing in the Bdinburgh Review for October, 1832, reproached him with the estabUishment of a kind of monopoly in consequence. But the simple truth is that the Newcastle factory Fas at that time the oniy source from which afficient engines could be obtained. Moreover, as respected the working of his engines, Stephenson naturally employed the men he had educated and sould trust, for it was a saying of his, " he could angineer matter very well, but his greatest diffiulty was to engineer men." He had no doubt a aatural preference fer the men of canny Newcastle; but who can blame him ? They were the fist materials in his path, and he moulded them to his occasions. And now the project of a railway from Liverpool to Manchester was again moving. It had been revived in the speculative year 1824, and overtures were made to Mr. Bradshaw, the Duke of Bridgewater's canal agent, to become a large proprietor of shares; but he hung out his colours on the outward walls, and replied, "' All or none." The income of the mnal was not less than 100,0001.; such a carrying brade went to lay the foundation of Bridgewaterhouse. But the Liverpool and Manchester men were 2ut upon their mettle when they found it was unsqual to the public requirements. Then a company uas formed. Then came journeys to KiUingworth ;o inspect Stephenson's engines, and lastly a survey Dy Stephenson himself, which was the commencement of the modern Iniad of which he was the &chillcs. At Knowsley he was driven off the ground by the keepers, and threatened with rough sandling if found there again. Afterwards, audlenly and unexpectedly-ante expectatam diem-he Lppeared upon the ground with a body of surveyors and their assistants, who outnumbered Lord Derby's keepers and farmers, and by this concen,ration of forces he succeeded in his aim, subject of ourse to the legal liabilities for trespass. The same ort of resistance was also offered by Lord Sefton's etainers, so that borings could not be made of the soil at Enowsley Moss, which was afterwards made an objection to Stephenson's estimates when the Bill came before Parliament. Bradshaw, at the head )f the Bridgewater clan, was stillmore resolute and sbstructive. Stephenson was threatened with a lucking, and had to take a great portion of his survey by stealth at the time the clan were at* linner. Guns were discharged to deter the measurers. Stephenson was twice turned off the lordship of Bradshaw and threatened with forcible abmuction to 'Worsley. It is not surprising there,ore, that his survey was extremely imperFect, and that it did not sustain the subsequent =riticism of the first engineers of the country. When arrangements g,were made for proceeding with the Bill in the Parliamentary sesgion of 1825 the trenches of its opponents were deliberately manned and opened. It was declared that the working of the ralway would prevent cows grazing and hens laying. The poisoned air from the locomotives would kill birds as they flew over them, and render the preservation of pheasants and foxes no longer possible. Householders adjoining the projected line were told that their houses would be burnt up by the fire thrown from the engine chimneys, while the air around would be polluted by clouds of smoke. The breed of horses would be extinguished; oats and hay would be unsaleable; and the occupation of horse-taming heroes would be gone. Country inns vwould be ruined; Boniface would become a byword; Jehu would starve; while pernicious boilers were bursting and blovwing his passengers to atoms. But then there was always this consolation to wind up with, that the weight of the locomotive would completely prevent its moving, and that railways, if made, could never be worked by steam power. And yet this was an age of speculations infinitely less legitimate. There were companies set on foot for all possible and impossiblo purposes; among them balloon companies to work passeuger traffic through the air at 40 miles an hour. e,ad road oampanies to run carriages 'jil turnpike roads at 12 miles an hour with rela as s4 bottled ga * instead of horses. Yet -when Stephe.,son, at the ce-isaultationsof counsel ptevions to the I YkrpQQ1 alwa Manchester BW going into committee, stated his expectation'of being able to impel his locomotive at the rate of 2> miles an hour, Mr. William -Brougham, wh'wvs retained by the promoters to conduct their case, frankly told him that if he did not modetate hiu viewx and bring his engine within a rcas4Q e spee4-e woald "inevitably damn the rhole thing, and helimself ba regarded a mauiac fit for Bedlam." The Qtrterly Review scouted the idea of trav,elling at'i greater epeed than eight or nine milea au -hour. "'Eo spe*k plain English" jayi the reviewpr, "the steam carriage may delude for a time, but mnustznd in tho nortification of those conoerned."' Amid-this awfal clamour and these portentous auguries, ahd In face of this powerfal i. .menacing oppp'ition, George Stephenson had manEully to gird up his lo'W to sastain the battle of his life and the caue of his generation.

THE PUBLIC HEALTfH. (From the Reg&strAr.General`A Roport, Sept. 7th.) The deaths registeredi in Lonon, which roe 4n the pe. viouB Week to 1,177, declined In the week thai ended on Saturday, September 5th, to 1,084, of which 537 are deAths dfia1es, 647 those oE females. Iuthe 10 years1e947-56, the average number of deaths in thp weeks corresponding with !ast week was 146; bat, as the deaths of lat v e* occurred n an increased population, the average, rith a viewr to com. parison, should be raised ia proportion to ih increase, whereby it wil become 1,610. It Will be seen, however, on reference to tho returis of 1849 aid 1854; that Jn tho corresponding week of the former year cholera carrip# off 2,026 persons, and in that of the latter 2,050, and tha t te averagar is consequently too high as a standard of eomiarison for seaons when only ordinary causes are in operation. After due allowance Is m adb for this circumstance the result is still very favourable as regards the public health ~t the pre. sent time. . Diarrhcoo continues to decline, though by slo* degree but it is more fatal than is wsal at the begiaini4g of September. The deaths from this complaint attilfk their maximum in the last woek of July, when theyrwere 302, after the mean weekly temperature had been for m fortnight 68deg. In eachs oeive week there was a deeo, ; and .ast week, when the mean temperature was 60 ' deg., the number of deaths returned from dlarrhma vwas 1B. Besides these 11 deaths are referred to dysentery in the, table for last week; and onlry 4 to cholera, all the cases in which the latter disease was fatal having occurred among Infants. An dlarrho3a declines typhus shows% a teidency to increas, for, though the deaths from it (52) wore less thsnintfte previous week, they were more numerous than in the ealier part of the summer. Two deaths from small-pox and -one frora chicken-pox are returned. The deaths of two pbrsons are atcrbed to intempeiance and no lea than eight 14 delirfum trcmens. Eleven infants died from want of sstrnilk Only one person of the 1,084 who died In the week had attained the age of 90 y0ars, and she was a widowr of 92. Last week the births of 790 boys and 784 glls, in an1 1,574 children, were registered In London. In tle ten oorresponding woeks of the years 1847-56 the averags number was 1,483.

LAND TBANSPORT FOR INDIA. TO THE EDITOR OF TE TIMES. Sir,-In one of your late articles Dn Indian a&irs YoM refer to the inferior quality of the drays which the Jndie, armyare compelled to use for the purposes of land transport, and you very properly remark that " if better carts can bo constractedin thin country, then It is only a question of contrat and any number that the Company nlght choose to order mra be put down before Christmas at the highest point reached by the river steamers." Now, Sir, I have just returned from AustraliaU where, 1n many parts of the oouatry, particularly about New South Wales and South Australia, the roads are exoeedingly mountainous, the mountains belng Intersectd by extensive plains of clayey soil, many of them from 20 to 50 milea across, and during the rainy moa (which there, as in India, lsts for months) they become so completely saturated rith water that the drays Immodiately sink down to their beds - and on the plains between the Barra-Burra copper mine andt Adelaide I have frequently lnown the copper-laden drays to be drawn for mUes in this state. It Is pereoctly clear, then, that the deseription of drays, which, after years of trial, are foand o t suitable for this sort of work im Australia, would just ee the desideratum in India, I therefore, beg that you will consider my desiro to bring tim construction of these drays before the Company £ sufficient apology for troublin you with my communication Theo drays are constracted of the best seasoned timber that can be procured, and to carry five tons ofdead weight- they rau on two wheels only, which is not only found to be the best for a deed up-hill pull, but is also actually necessary in order that tbey may be able topat into practice those wrigglings and twistings whioh every AustrlIan bullock dtiver knows is so effectual In extricating his dray from a bog, 6r working it up a mountain aide. They are drawn by four, six, eight, 10, or 12 bullocks, according to the weight of the loading, or state of tho road to be travelled. Buiooks are found to answer better than horses, as horses are never found to ba thoroughly stanch In a bog; keep the dray moving but ever so little, and they are all right, but onoe get bogged, and they will either pau by suddon andi frenzied jerks, and consequently smash all their harness, or else they wiil become stubborn, and refuse to puU at all. Whereas bullocks rarely or ever object either to asoend or descend the most precpitoaus hills, and always plU steadily and faithfuly until they drop dead. They are generally yoked two abroast to a very strong pole, attached to tha oentre of the dray; the yoke being of the most simple construction, consisting of a beam of wood placed on the aui. mals' necks, through which two iron or wooden bows pass, encircling the shoulders, the end of the pole passing through a ring attached to the oentre of the yore, and ocured by iron pins passing through the pole, one on each side of the ring. But when shafts are usedonly one bullockis put into tbem, and he is harneised exactly the same as a horso, but the leading ones are coupled two abreast by means of the wooden yoke. The advantage of the pole and wooden yoke consists in its simplicity, so that In long and rough journeys, should the pole or yoke break, they can be replaced by tho driver himself cutting down a tree, and with hIs axe and augro immediately replacing them. I bave my. self, wnen very many miles from any settlement, taken out the broken pole, and put in a new one in a few hours, with no other tools than an axe and augre Should the dray upset the pole does no more than revolve in the rlug, the pins drop out, and the bullocks walk off uninjured. Breaks are also attached to the back part of the dray and efficlently applied by means of a screw and lever. But the adrantage of harnemsing tho shaft bullock consists in his being able to throw the whole weight of his body into the breechinz in desoending a mountahx side, and consequently he has the advantage of those yoked by the neck, as they can only hold back by their heads, and are thus in mountainous roads knocked up much sooner than the harnessed and shafted animaL A dray drawn by eight bullocks can easily be managed by one good man. The buolocks are turned loose at night to pick tbeir food from the grsw, which even in the hot weather, so hardy are these animals, is rarely found inmufficient to support them for a journey of many hundred miles, no corn or food of any kind being carred for them; andin the winter, spring, and nutmnthey thus maL-e journeys of many thousand miles and arrive back almost as fresh as they started I have no doubt that something of this kind is very much wanted for land transport in India; and I foel certan that they would answer, and with themo I would undertalke to travel in any part of India, even during the dopth of' tho Wetseason, the swimming them over rivers being a very slight obstacle. In Australia, during the winters 51 and 1S5% no roads being made to the goldfields, and the bridges s#ept off by 'the floods, the carriage to the fields was entirely eonfined to these drays, the drivers having to swim theym 'over several ivers on their journey thither, horses aid horse drays being only available in dry weather and level roads. As you ell remark, any amount of these drays could be made in England and sent out. Having in Australia not only manufactured them, but also used them in the most distant, difficult, and dangorous jounmeys, crossing swvampy p'ains, ascending and descending the most precipitous hills, Ihave the greatest confidence in recommending theml to the attention of the Hen East India Company. Hoping you may deem this aorthy of insertion, and enClosing my name and adiess, I beg to remain, Si Yours resnecfollv COOBY. Sept. 7.

THE BENGAZ ABMY. TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES. Sir,-As soon as the storm which now devastates the north-west provinces of India has subsided the question as to the best mode of re-organizing the Bengal army wil be ono that will demand the deep and serions attention of the Government. Conneoted with this subject I beg to offer the; following remarks, founded on a continuous service of 16 years in the Bengal Presidency. The opinion seems now to be very general, and I thn there can be no doubt that it is the true one, that the present deplorable mutiny owes its origin to the intrigues of the Mahommedan portion of the population, working upon the elements of disaffeotion which have been known for a long time to exist in the Bengal army. How comes it, then, that of the three armies of Bengal, Hadras, and Bombay the first only has been tainted, while the last two, of wich the conditions are apparently similar to those of the first, have resisted all attempts to shake their loyalty I Among the causes which have led to such disarous result3 in Bengal the following are undoubtedly the most prominent:- L The vicious system of reerniting, which draws nearly the whole of the soldiors, whether for the artillery, cavalry, sappers, or infantry, from a limited tract of country east of the Jumna. This system has c onverted the whole of the regulararmy, as well as a large portion of the irregular troops and contingents, into a huge olan, possessing coramon feeliegs and opinions, and enjoying every facfilty for inter. communication and the hatching of plots and mutinies. 2. The suicidal preference given by commanding officers and adjutants of regiments to high caste men. Brahmins and Chottrees or Rajpoots are selected almost to the exclusdon of Hindoos of lower castes, who, though not as a class sufh fine-looking meen as the former, yet have proTed themselves in the Bombay army to be equally good fighting men. Brahmins are known all over India to be most arant 1ntriguers, and there was perhaps not a regiment in the Bengal army in which their insidious influences conld not be traced. It is true that Government orders exist regulating the number of Brahmins to be entertained in each regiment. It Is equally true that commanding officers have been strictly enjoined to take oppor. tunities of enliating Sikhs in certai proportions to every company. But these orders may b said to be dead lotiors. Brahmins, aided by their brethren in the different regiments, find no diffioulty in evading the regulations; and in many eorps the power exerted by the Brahmlns and Rajpoot offioers, commissioned and non-commissioned, over the minds of their commandants and adjutants, has been effectaal in keeping the hated Sikhs out of all participation in service. 3. The miserably lax state of discipline, to which I blush to confess the taun t of the officers of the other Presidencies is but too applicablo, that the offlcers of the Bengal army were afraid of their men. I will not take up your space by quoting from Colonel Jacob's admirable pamphlet the many prcofs adduced to establish thefactthatnodisiplineworthy of the name was to be found in the Bengal army; but I would refer to it all those who wish to be thoroughly enlightened on thispoint. Caustic as his remarks are, and humiliating to us as a body, I cannot but confess that they are true to the letter. From my own personal experience I will glvo two out of numerous instances to show what the " loyal" Bengal Sepoy has been permitted to do with impunity. At the siege of lMooltan, in 1848, more than one Bengag Native Infantry regiment openly refused to work in the trenches, throwing down the tools served out to them, and saying that " they were not coolies to go and dig." While the army under Lord Gough was encamped at Chilianvallah, after the battle of the 13th of January, 1849, it was found necessary to clear away some of the dense jungle that grew in front of the camp. The Sappers were not numerous enough for this duty, and native infiatry regiments were ordered to assist. I saw one regiment (If my recollection serves me, it was the " loyal 70h NaYIve Infantry) in the most insolent and mutinous manneron parade refase to take the abillhooksoffered to them. I bolievetheir officers talked them over into doing their duty, but I did not hear of any Sepoy being called to account for disobodi. ence of orders. 4. The system of promotion by seniority among the native officers, 'whioh leads to the native commibdoned ranks being filled with worn-out and useless men. 5. The tendency to centralization observable in every department under the Bengal Government, but which in lone Is so injurious as in the miltary service. In the regular branches of the army this evil is more particularly traceable. From the constant clipping of the authority, of :ommanding offlcers they have been reduced to mere 1iphero. To such an extent is this carried that I have lcnown cases in 'which Sepoys, tried by regimental courts. nartial and sentenced to be dismissed the service for gross Insubordination towards thoir commanding officers have ippealed by urzee (written petition) to the Commander-in. ,hief, and have been restored to the regiments which they "ad disgraced. Can an ythiDg more ruinous to the welfare >f the service be devised 7Examples of this nature have ccmrred frequently enough to give rise to a feeling among the men that they have only to gain the ear of one Df the great men at head-cquarters to be enabled to upset any order of their own officers. One of the great secrets of the comparatlve efficiency of irregnlar corps con. fists in the greater authotity possessed by the officers attached to them; but even in this branch of the servioe, [regret to say, symptoms have lately appeared of a determination on tho part of the head-quarters officials to iun termeddle in matters In which they have no concern. I Dould give proof of this assertion, but I shall content myself by referring you to any officer of experience in command of an irregular cavalry regiment to bear me out. 6. The paucity of officers present with the regular regiments, whero a much stricter discipline is supposed to be maintained than in irregular corps. Any one may convince himself of the existence of the deficioncy to which I allude by examining the last Indian Army List. Look at the regiments of regular cavalry; see how the late increase to the captains and lieutenants has been carried out I That increase has been hitherto a moro farce, for the pro. motions have absorbed the whole of the cornets, except one each in two regiments, and to fill up vacanies cadots are being sent out in driblets of one or two now and thea. Look at almost every regiment of the line. In how many I is the order attended to which fixes the number of absentees I on staff employ ? Add to these absentees those away on i furlough or sick certificate, and the result in many cases is that in addition to the commanding officer and regimental staff from two to three lieutenants and some young ensigns are present. Among these, the only officers available for; the command of mosb of the companies, and regimental I duty generally, perhaps there are not three who count six years' service, and not two who can speak the language of their men with fluency. 7.-But perhaps not all these causes, combined with others that I have not enumerated, could have produced the mutiny of the Bengal army, whatever their effect in causing every regiment to be rotten to the core, if the insane policy of denuding the country of European troops had not led the Sepoys, who saw themselves in possesdon of nearly every magazine and every treasury, to believe that the I opportunity for successful revolt had arrived. Let us examine for a moment the disposition of the European troops In the older provinces of the Bengal Presidency, from CaL. cutta to UImballa, including the newly-acquired Oude territory. In this immense area, upwards of 1,100 miles inlength, and with an average width of 250 to 300 miles, excluding the recently-annexed dominions of the Nagpore Rajah, and the independentStates of Scindiah,Holkar, and the Rajpoo. tana chiefs, we had when the mutiny broke out two regi- I ments of cavalry and four regiments of infantry-a force of, say, 5,000 Europeans. I have not counted the regiment at the Presidency, as that was required solely for the defence of Calcutta. And how were these regiments stationed ? One infantry regiment at Dinapore; one ditto at Lucknow, 300 miles distant; one ditto at Agra; one infantry and one c -valrY regiment at Meernt; and one cavalry regiment at TTm1a1a. istru, htteewr he oeifnr Umballa. itis truethab th-ere wrere three more infantry corps in the hlll sthtions beyond Umballa, but they wera at the extreme end of the district we are considering, and for overawilg the Sepoys below practically useless. So, then, in the whole of the turbulent province of Rohilound we had not a single European regiment; in Oude, annexed to our enpire butayear and a half ago, one solitary corps, and that drawn sway from the important station of Cawnpore, which, as well as the still more important poet of Allahabad, was intrusted solely to native troop. Contrast this state of tbings with that in the Punjab, where a more adequate European force, combined with Sir J. Lawrence's wise measures and vigorous policy, has kept the country comp^caratively quiet. I beg to enclose my cardt and subscribe myself, 1yours obedientl.y- A BBNGAL OFFIC0R
LO2tVDON, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 187. The breaking up of the ice on the Neva or one of the great American rivers is always described as a marvellous andc fearful spectacle. But it cannot be so marveUous or so fearful as the state of things of which it is the interruption. It is not so wonderful, nor is it so just a reason for apprehension, as a wide and deep river covered with a solid pavement of ice, traversed by innumerable people and vehicles, and even occupied with stalls and habitations. As you walk through the busy world, or sleigh for miles down its snowy reaches, you may reflect that when the mercury has risen a couple of inches in the glass tube before you aU will be gone, and where your horses tramp a running stream will glitter in the sun, or be chafed with the breeze. By tho same rule, what is the real wonder of this sad Indian story? Is it that some fifty millions of people in the centre of India, far away from our own element, have suddenly risen against less than ten thousand people of a remote race, a hated religion, and offensive customs, and in so doing have betrayed the innate treachery and cruelty of the barbaric nature ? Or is it, rather, that these people, and, indeed, nearly all Hindostan, have now for a good part of a century submitted to these rulers in peace and quietness ? Compared with that vast population, and still more with 'cheirsavage natures, their gloomy traditions, and their fierce fanaticism glowing under the surface, the rule of such a handful as we have ever been there has been a goasamer web or the film of a bubble. For forty thousand men to be the masters of forty other thousand is not always an easy affair. But in this instance we have long ruled over two hundred millions, scattered over a vast continent, and divided by great rivers, deserts, and mountain ranges. Elow have we been able to do this ? No doubt, tho Hindoo character is the airy basis of this dominion. Our empire is built upon the ch2ffish levity and feminine inconstancy of the race , upon its ready suspicions and its prone delusios. . on the treachery and ferocity which each rw. thee hides within his own bosom and kncrwa to reside in his neighbour's; and on tie mysterios awe with which they regard a just and b onounsble foreign race. The terrible process now going ea in India is only the rough dissection of a puzle. We now see the rulers, and we now see the subjects. Henoe forth no one can wonder at the places they have respectively occupied. Tb e furious Saturnalia of a people who exult at orner, over their mars and over humanity, over n,,tur, itself, and who, released from thraldora, are monsters, convicts them of natural bondage, anId justifies our rule. Every Indian authority he s maintained the necessity of a stern rule aud axn aggressive attitude, and has hardly been belie ved. We now see what it is to let tho Hindoo imagine for a moment that ho has seen the limit of our power. Wbat we have had to deal with, whether in our ordinary occupation of India or in the present hideoua tumult, has been naturally the more energetio, tie more dominant, and more turbulentclasses. Amid a singularly peaceful and gentle population, Oa the Hindoo agriculturists and artisans are said to be, we find the descendanut of conquerors, hereditary robbers and murdereih ; ."Iudred Royal families stained with crimes, new and old. The daiy will come when the atrocities of this fearful tragedy will be referred to thefv proper authors; and, no doubt, the Hindoo cha&raxr, as a whole, will be relieved from some of the darker shades that now seem to rest upon it. The ier. vanta have often shown fidelity, even at their own risk; the villagers bave been hospitable, even under terror; Rajahs and Zemindars have harboured and conveyed wretchd bands of fugitives; the poor Coolies have still carried those whom they might have pludered with impunity; and, on tho whole, it is remarkable how much the country goes on as usDal, even during the triumph of an insurgent soldiery. Out! affair is not so much with the harmles workdng bees of the hive as with tho drones-the numerous armed clases whom we found dettroying one another, and whom we compelled to respect life, property, and a common rule. The number of these of the baser sort may be estimated from the fact that at every considerable city affected by the Mutiny sveral thousand prisoners have been released from gaol, and have naturally proceeded to overy kind of outrage. Throughout the kingdom of Oude and some neighbouring districts it has ever been the rule to carry arms, and no man, rich or po6r, could safely dispense with them, whether in the city or in the field. Elsewhere, too, there are everywhere families ai,d whole tribes who hold the profession of arms, and claim to be so employed by some master or other. The fidelity of such men to a foreign Power must ever be questionable. From time immemorial they have been selling their allegiance from one cause to another, and it is natural to them to be still looking out for the highest bidder. But what we expect from the mercenary, the military adventurer, the reclaimed marauder, and even the princely pretender, is that they should not make new professions of fidelity and kindness the very engines of a murderous conspiracy. It is this which constitutes the Asiatic character of the Mutiny, and stamps India -as a country which must evet be under the heel of a foreign lord. That which cringes and creeps, and flatters and fawns, at the moment it is preparing to sting wiu always be stamped upon by force or charmed by cunning policy. As absolute slavery is the invariable heritage of hrutishness and base nature, so political subordination is the sure and natural fate of those who want the openness and -honesty of freemen. Not a rival can venture now to tell us that the people we have so long governed in India 'with a large measure of success are fit to gove themselves, or are ever likely to be so. NZiA SAEUB, as we read in one of the last letters sent from Cawnpore, was on terms of intimacy with several of the offlicers there, civil as well as military. Before the Mutiny fairly broke out at that place, and while the British were still temporizing, in the vain hope that the recapture of Delhi would restore peace and confidence, NmxA $SB proposed to bring his fifteen hundred men to the assistance of the British garrison at Cswnpore, and for the dispersion of the mutineers. At the same time he was entreating his " favourites," among them the CihieW Collector, to send their young wives and chidren to his castle at Bithoor, as a place of safety. The writer of & letter before us, who was eventuitUy one of his victims, speaks with the most implicit reliance on his friendship and honoor, evidently without a moment's mistrust of his proffered aid and hospitality. Sho speaks of him, by the wkiv, as a man of immense wealth and power. That such a man, with a considerable army of his own, should occupy a large estate, and a stronghold of very difficult approach, only six milesfrom Cawnpore, not inherited, but actually presented to him by the British ralers of India, certainly speaks for our simplicity, but does not show uis hard masters. Why, however, do we recur to it ? Because this man, whosel crimes seem to surpass even what human nature was thought capable of, is, after all, the aptest type of the Mutiny. A thousand old trusted native officers, men of 30 or 40 years' service, have shown, if not the same brutality, at least equal treachery. At Allahabad such were the men who enticed the officers of the 6th Regiment out of the fort with protestations of affection and fidelity, only to slaughter them all as they sat in their mess-room. Such were the men who at Lucknow turned the guns on their gallant chief, whom they had entreated to lead them out against the mutineers. Everywhere there are the same features of treachery on the one side, and abused confidence on the other. Doubtless, the history of these events has provoked a smile against us now and then in foreign circles. Why have we shown this ridiculous confidence when surrounded by traitors? How is it that they could ever hope much from so transparent a game? The answer is, that in India we are known to be truthful men, to speak the truth, and to believe. We have been credulous. The very artifices thus employed are au appalto our moral superiority. We are supposed to take men at their word, because we are men of our word ourselves, and this has been the secret of our Indian empire.
Open-air preaching is one of those peculiar religious demonstrations which partalke of the nature of a chaUenge to the world at large. It is. an assertion of manorial rights, a proclaraa. tion that you are lord of the soil, that youL are at home on the ground, and that all around, you-earth, air, and sky-is your own. A Chris tian missionary, indeed, on first evangelizing a country preaches in the open air, because he has no church to preach in; bxIs where a religion comes out into the open air freom preference, when it can stay indoors if it likea, it is rather an amertion of lordship, supremacy, and dominion. Skich ank aeb is therefore only in. good taste wben tho. religiou wbich does it is tbny and in fact the domi, nant religion, the religion of the mass. Whatever of slf-amertion is ismelved in this act. in in that case supported by the fadt, and no o:w has any right to complain of ib as an assumption. Protestant oper-air preaching is thus a perfectly fair proed ing in this co-eitry, because Prote&'=xtisxr is tbe religion of the muss. RoImanists may not like it; but, as they are oaly a fraction of the population, it is but good manners, not to say necessary discretion in them, quietly to submit to thi piece of self-assertion on the part of the religion of the nation. On the other hand, while nobody would deny the abstract right of a Romanist to preach in the open air in this country, the act would not have the same excise, and it would to a certainty bring its own punishanent upon it, for no police could secure the preacher an uninterrupted hour. The game rule applies to another kind of open-air demonstration -that one of which Romanists are so fond. Pro-. cessions in the open air are to the Romanist what open-air preaching is to the Protestant,-they are intended as a means of impressing tho population at large; they are his way of bringing religion under their noses, and forcing them to sse it. These Drooeesions, then, are quite in place where Roman Catholicism is tho religion of the mass of the people, and no Protestant, that we are aware of, cornplains of them. As one of a smaIl maino. rity he submits with a good grace-nay, is plemoa enough with the spectacle, and stands half-an.. hour at the corner of a foreign street while the gay train passes. But open-air Romuanist procemions iu this Country would be plainly pieces of impeisti
" Can any good thing in the way of art come out *'of Manchester I' is a question that has often been -asked, and never more earnestly than when the idea of collecting the art treasures of the United Kingdom within a building to be erected in the neighbourhood of that great emporium was first announced. It was a splendid project, and we have borne our testimony to the immense value .of the result, which is most creditable to -an who have shared in the undertaking. .But now that the Exhibition will very shortly close, and almost all of us who have been able to spare a few days have flocked to its galleries, .and have gazed with admiration upon so many treasures that are once more to return to private cabinets and distant couptry houses, where they wil be effectually lost to the public, we may be permitted to express some regret that the advantages which but a very few comparatively have been able to command have not been more widely "diffused by the choice of a more favourable site for 'the Exhibition. We are very much within the mzark when we say that as yet the total number, -mot of visitors, but of visits that have been paid to the Mancheater Exhibition is below a million, the 4*tal number of actual visitors being probably about two-thirda of a million. The wonders of the Mancherter Gallerysurely deserve a much larger attendance. Why, these marvels of art, Which are so soon to be dispersed, and which it is extremely ,doubtM wnether we shall ever see again collected together, have not drawn greater crowds than sometimes in a single year resort to our pert inanett exhibitionu of the BritiAh Museum, aad National Gallery; they have not as yet drawn so large an assemblage as in the year 1S51 went to the National Gallery alone. It is a proof, as we have said, that the site has been ill-chosen. Manchester may devise, and it may produce the best Exhibition of Art in the world; but it has to contend with the difficulty of its position; Never was there any species of undertaking so esentially metropolitan as the collection into one gallery of our artistic treasures. The Industrial Exhibition of 1851 might with much more propriety have been held at Manchester than this, which requires, what is to be fouind only in a metropolis, a large amount of taste sufficiently cultivated to appreciate extraordinary excellence. It is no discredit to the Lancashire population to say of them that they do not possess this taste, for the formation of which such an education of the eye and other senses is needed as they have never had an opportunity of acquiring. It is true that many persons from London have visited and enjoyed the Exhibition in Manchester; but the number who could not sacrifice the necessary time is enormous. Time is, indeed, the heaviest tax which could be exacted from those most capable of appreciating the collection, not less than a week being necessary to see it all; and even the week could not give that facility of becoming really acquainted with the piCtures which frequent short visits might have afforded. If to these considerations it be replied that Manchester, and not London, conceived the plan, collected the funds, erected the building, and took all the trouble, and that therefore to Manchester the reward is due, we must observe, without at all depreciating the merits of the committee who have managed the business, or of the capitalists who have guaranteed it from loss, that it is they who contributed their pictures and other works of art who really are the Exhibitors, and that these would much rather have sent their treasures to London than to Manchester. In point of fact, London alone has probably contributed ten times as many pictures and objects of art as all Lancashire. This noble undertaking has been in the stricteat sense a national one, to which the metropolis has afforded the most important aid; and, should it ever be in contemplation to repeat the experiment, the history of the collection, and the class of visitors which has flocked to it, will prove beyond all doubt not only that it would have been easier in the first instance to form the Exhibition in the metropolis, but also that there alone can it receive adequate'appreciation, be visited in sufficient numbers, and defray its expenses. We should be in some measure reconciled to the great loss to which the vast majority of our countrymen must submit in the absence of the Exhibition from the metropolis if we could be assured that Manchester will greatly benefit by its presence. Manchester in some sort lays claim to metropolitan honours. It is the metropolis of manufacture; and it was, in fact, the very antagonism which seems to exist between Manchester manufactures and treasures of art that to some minds recommended the scheme of an Exhibition in that strangely chosen locality. If the truth must be spoken, however, the Lancashire people do not seem to prize very highly what in London would be regarded with an interest second oIly, if second at all, to that which the GreatExhibitionof 1851calledforth. The undertaking owes its success hitherto principally to visitors from all parts of the country. They come from afar to see rare works which they have often heard of, but which it seemed that their eyes were never destined to behold. By wonderful exertions on the part of the Committee, and by a most honourable liberality on the part of the exhibitors, the artistic treasures of a nation the richest in such possessions are collected in a palace of art; they are arranged, not, indeed, perfectly, but after a clearer and more instructive method than any to which we have been accustomed in this country; the whole is at the very door of the Lancashire artisan. But the people of Lancashire seem to be alone unmoved. It is a universal law thv;t the passing stranger knows more of the sights of a town than the inhabitant who lives among them all his days; and the men of Lancashire seem to extend this principle even to a sght like the Exhibition of Art Treasures, which it' is extremely doubtful whether we shall ever behoid again, which many thousands throughout England have made great sacrifices to see but for a single day, and which it is of much importance that Manchester should come prominently forward to support. It would indeed be a lasting disgrace to that community if through any supixteness on tLeir part the Exhibition should not pr - a to be a complete financial success. Nothing can j. 'fy the selection of Manchester as the site of the Gallery without a great success of this kind.

MURDER IN H[ORsEMONoER-LAI PRLSo.f.-Yesterday evening Mr. W. Carter held an inquest in Horse. monger-lane Gaol respecting the death of John Hodges. The evidence confirmed the account given in Tlhe Tihas of yesterday in the Southvwark Police report, from which it appears that a man named James Preston, a prisoner for debt in the same prison. struck the deceased on the head while in bod with a pail, and inflicted such injuries as to cause his death. Preston, who heard the evidence given, in answer to a question from the coroner, said that the wit nesEes were not far from being correct in what they had said. Thejury returned a verdict of "Wilfal iaurder" against the prisoner.

SECOND EDITION. THE TIMRESOFFICE, Wednesday.Mor7ing. EXPRESS FROM PARIS: I Tho followving is the letter of our Parn cornv spondent, dated yesterday (Tuesday), 6p.m.:- The accounts received here of the disBareement between the canton of Vaud and the Federal Council are thought to be somewhat highly coloured, at least as regards its probable consequences. On the part of the canton the question appears to be chiefly one of ameur propre, and its history may be briefly told. Vaud desired that the railway connecting Lausanne and Berne should pass by Yverdun and Morat; the Federal Council decided for the more direct line by Oron and Fribourg. The Council of State of Vaud, finding its wishes overruled, put obstacles in the way of the execution of the works, forbade the deposit and publication of the plans, and, on learning that ground had been broken on Vaudois territory, published #An arrete, or decision, to the effect that, the niecesry formalities not having been complied with, the works should be suspended. The Cantonal Couneil thus put itbelf in open opposition to that of the Federation. The Oron Company, as well as the rribourg Government, forthwith entered a protest against the threatened violent interraption of the works comrnenced, and the Company resolved to continue them until forcibly brevented. The Federal Council revoked the decision of that of Vaud, and, it is said, will occupy the canton militarily rather than yield an inch. On -the other hand, it has been stated that the Vaudois Executive had called out a battalion to maintain its interruption of the works. It is not eertain, however, that it has as yet proceeded to that extremity, and it is probable that the quarrel will not go further than much excitement in the pleasant Pays de Vaud, and a few furious articles in the NouveUiste Vaudois. Vaud is evidently in the wrong, and to persist would only be to raise a fruit less contest, in which it would certainly be worsted. The worthy Vaudois, excellent people in their way, adepts at making out hotel bills for roving foreigaers, and at producing agreeable wine from -the sunny Elopes that border Lake Leman, are occasionally a little hot-headed and excitable, and, in the present instance, having been thwarted by the great men at Berne, they have evidently made themselves diEagreeable. A little reflection will, doubtless, show them the impropriety and inutilty of further resistance, and we may hope to see this weighty question settled -without display of hostile banners or fratricidal encounter between Eelvetia'a sons. It was quite enough to be electrified by a Royalist erusade in NeuchAtel in 1856, and it is devoutly to be desired that Europe may not be ahocked by the spectacle of a railway campaign in Vaud in 1857. Notwithstanding recent positive statements on the subject, uncertainty still prevails with respect to the exact date at which tha new elections in Moldavia wiU take place. It is not of great moment whether they be fixed for the month of October or for the expiration of 15 days after the reeeipt by the Kaimakan of the orders of the Porte to annul the previous ones. In the latter case they would commence on the 10th of September. The only really important point is, that the dispositions taken by Prince Vogorides with respect to these elections have given satisfaction to all the Powers concerned. There -was some slight contradiction between aecounts recently received from Madrid and informa tion derived from the best sources in Paris, with respect to the exact nature of the intervention on the part of England and France, in the pending dispute with Mexico, to which the Spanish Govermment had agreed. On the one hand it was represented as positive arbitration, admitting of no appeal; while, on the other, it was declared to be 'cofined to simple mediation, which mightbe broken off at any moment by the will of either of the disputant Governments. The truth may be said to lie betweenthe two statentie,a. Strictly speaking, it is the mediation of England and France that has been accepted 'bSpain and propozed to Maxico. But it Is clearlyr *tmiderstood that Spain so far commits herself to th. bands of the mediating Powers that she will not ralse objections to such terms as they, having due regard to her interests and dignity, Shall r-onmmend to her acceptance. It is not dc t dA that Mexico will entrust her intetests to th al Lands with a similas: understanding. The mediating Powers can have M3 wish but to see justice done between the two countries, they can have no interest but to avert a war which, once commenced, might lead to very serious complications. And they had a right to expect, when offering their good offices, something approaching to a cerinty that these should not be exerted in vain. The important point was to arrive at such an understanding with Spain as should entirely preclude all prospect of her coming to blows with MIexico. To this end were directed the combined efforts of Lord Howden and M. de Turgot at Madrid; and I believe I am correct in stating that the French Government considers it to have been fully attained. The dissensions between the great majority of the United Greek Catholics and their Patriarch still continue, and although the affair is not of a nature to excite great attention in Europe, the case of these poor people is certainly a hard one. Because they will not adopt the Gregorian calendar they are persecuted, prohibited the use of their churches, and deprived of the sacraments and exercise of their religion. The consequence is, that many of them are seceding from the Greek Catholic Church, and schisms of all kinds are creeping in. The small minority that had espoused the views of the Patriarch is rapidly dwindling. A letter from Damascus, of the 19th of August, now before me, says, that 220 of these had addressed the Patriarch, remonstrating with him, as chief of their church, on the scandal occasioned by the exclusion of 3,226 of their brethren from the church built at their own cost, such exclusion having for its sole pretext their adherence to their old usages and refusal to accep. the new calendar. The signers of the address further declared, that if they had agreed to the change of calendar, it was only in the belief that all the others would do the same; but that, seeing this was not the case, they urged the Patriarch to return to the old one, the ehange being in no way a matter affecting religion. They added that, if he refused, they themeelves intended to joining the great body of their co-religionists. If they adhere to this resolution, barely 500 Catholics, out of the 4,000 in Damascus, will remain on the side of the Patriarch. The United Greek Catholic- Church of Egypt and the East reckons 84,0M souls. Of these 9,OW at first went with the- Patriarch, but they have dwindled to 7,000, and will, doubtless, furthar decrease in number. Similaz complaints reach us from Alexandria. The chbrch there continues closed; Both at Damascus and at Alexandria the public voice denouwees the French Consuls as encouraging the T'.triarch, by promises of support, to perSever3, in the ohange of calendar so unpalatable to his 'Reok. The Greek COttolhCa live In hopes that the persecution they are subjected to 'wi attract the attention of the French Government, and that orders will be givex to the Coneuls to cease their intermeddling,1wen. it is thought the Patriarch woui no longer bsklv out.

Various reports are current reqpeeti His Majestyxn movements. It is said that Xi will leave the camp on the 21st, which would aTlow JXum to come to Paris for a couple of days before pioceeing to Sbuttgard for theinterview of the 25Wh. Araoqa other floating rumours is one that the K gs of Prmssia and of BaYvia will be present at that interview. The last depatches received by the French Government from Hongkong contradict the announcement in the American papers that the United St4tes xquadrou in the Chinese Seas had taken poesetion of the liland of Formosa. The squadron in q1testion, according to these despatches, const only of the steam frigate Jacinto, of 13 guns, and the corvett,e Levante, carrying 18. tf Pichon, the new French Charg6 dAffaires to tlhe Court of Persia, has received orders to proceed immnediately to his destination.

The mission vwhih the Ruslan Government has kept up at Pe}ln since 1660 is directed by a Greek archimandrite, saisted by a certain number of priests to give spiritual assistanc to such of their co.religionists as may happen to be in the country. At the request of the late Emperor Nicholas, the Russian mission has been muccesdvely increased in number by the addition of several students and other persons versed in geographical acience. Oa the decennial renewal this yesr of the staff of the misdon, the Emperor Alexander thought it advtageous to add to it several mility and cdvil engineers, and wlin the archimandrite presented himself at the frontiers ofZiackta, accompanied by much a numerous body, the MAndarin would not take on himself to allow such a number of forelgners to enter, as they might by travelling by short stag be able to make themsdves geographically and stra. tegilsly acquainted with the country and with the best roadi to proceed direct to Peldn. he mlission is therefore conipe1led to remain on the frontier until the Mandarin re. Oeires instructions from his Government, unless the Russan Government should order them to proceed by sea to the northern provinces of China." The Russian Government has authorized its Consul in the part of Bessarabia recently separated from its frontier to give the inhabitants passports to cross the new Russian frontier as often as they please. The passports are to be valid three months at a titne without a new visa.

From a member of the local committee for managing the approaching meeting of Evangelical Christians from all countries at the instigation of the Prussian Brauch of the Evangelical AUiance I learn, that the number of clergy from Berlin and its nelghbourhood that will take part in the proceedings far exceeds the expectations that had till very lately been entertained. The same applies also to the number of foreignerr who have announced their intention of travelling hither and being present at the meetings. The former statement is matter equally for surprise and gratifc4tion, considering the amount of virulent oppoSitlo.i that had been exhibited here against the movementi by men of standing and ifluence, and the amount of reckless calumny and assiduous nis. representagtions they had resorted to, not without a great apparent amount of sucess at the moment. It would appear, however, that the gradual exposure of their misstatements and calumnies has, at length, produce& a natural reaction, vwhich has also been maievially accelerated by a series of public discourses that have been delivered here gratuitously, with a view to relieving the public min.O from the errors imposed upon it. In addition tr, these explanations and exhortations, one bold id',a has been put forward with great sueccess, and 'is of aDature to captivate the Germanm d, *viz, tb e levessity the Church lies under of rer.dering its c.eedsnd articles, and points of practicr, complete b the itrod'~u, even at this late how, of a little chbi,tian Charity aad tolean6e, ^ sengiment totblly At varianeo with thw bigot zeal with which the Lutherin Clhurch ha5 just of late been pashi4g iWta ueewesover the other less agressive portions of the Evangelical Church in P.Meia. The name ide w already some years aLo bro*ched by Neander in $;very happy form of exymusaion, to the effect that, while churches had g-rwn up in Chaitendom in the names of St. rete and St. Paul, with their respective attri,b*es,. thre was as yet no church that embodied the spiit of St. John. To, do this latter and raise up an edifice on the base of Christian love and tolerance would' seem to be the miasion of Prussia, and it ii one which the King distinctly reccgnizes and is srFivng after with admirable consistency and firmnem rt is to his firm language, as expressed in his recext order to the Ober-Kirecbenrath, and in the artic'e of the PreussisLch. £7onepondenz, which I lately forwarded you, that the change of sentiment and intention, as regarai the approaching meetings, must be attributed; as far as regards the clergy of tne Mark Brandenburg, and this revointion of feeling will be still greater when it is known that His Maijesty intends to be present one day as Da auditor at ono of the meetings, and that he bts requested that the most prominent participators therein may be introduced to him during their stay here. It is also in conformity to the King's lmconDealed leaning towards this movement in Protestant Christendom, that the Consistory of Brandenburg has, in reply to. an inquiry as to what foreign religionists would be permitted to preach in Berlin auring these solemnities, given its perminwsg.ow svery French and Geruma c ymanmwhoo 2aAej waa put forward; and, it the abiseno of any Engag4 lsih names specifically mentioned, the lib6nce to preach has been extended to every and aiir clergyman of the Church of England, and to every clergyman among the Moravian Brothers, without this specification being intended in any way to act 1s a limitation or exclude others from applying ror a licence. The President of Police has also ha3tened of his own accord to inform the Managing Dommittee that all the visitors to these meetings ihall be exempted from all the usual formalities conaeoted with the announcement of their arrival, &c., %nd the taking out of a permission de s6jour, and that he will provide for the unobstructed ingreEs and 2gress of the memnbers to their places of meeting, md that their deliberations shall not be disturbed by lie noise of passing traffic. Our countrymen, theretore, may on this occasion meet together for buiness )r devotion as freely as if on British ground, and Psithout the least fear of police espio7vge, and howwver natural and matter of course these arrange. nents appear to Engtishmen, it must not be lost dght of that they would have cost a great deal of inme and trouble to obtain had they not been so !reely volunteered at once. The severe reproof that the King directed the )ber-Kirchenrath toadministertothe "various clergy md theologians" who had used such cru pulous neans in the hopes of discrediting the Evangelical illiance, and deterring their countrymen from naking part in these meetings, has impelled Dr. 3tahl, the most prominent of the ultra-Lutheran ?arty, and one of its most intolerant members, t.) mend in his resignation as a member of the Supreme Donsistory, and there is no doubt that this resignazion will be accepted by the King, even although Dr. Stah1 Is the leader of the ultra-Conservatives of the flouse of Notables, and the King's own judicia' idviser in matters of canonical law (kron-syndicus). rhis is the " second heavy blot and great disouragement " that has fallen on the dominant and domineering party in the Evangelical Church mf Prussia within the last few months; the first having been the deprival of the Minister of Public Worship of the right of proposing candidates for the King's nomination to any high post in the Church when vacant, it having been 6bserved that it was his habit, in conformity with his 6wot predilections for ultra-Lutheranism, to propose exclusively men of that profesaion instead of using due impartiality towards the various confessions that go to nake up the entire body of the Church. The affection of the eyes which has lately exhibited itself in so virulent a form among the troops in garrison here is stated by medical men to be the Egyptian ophthalmla ; it manifests itself in a number of small white vesicles beneath the lower 3yelid, which, if not promptly removed by a solution )f lunar caustic, increase very rapidly, and soon sxtend in the form of a white crust or scab over the whole eye and dry up its fluids. Although iome entire regiments havel hitherto escaped this infliction, others have had such considerable numbers of their men rendered unfit for duty, that the men of the reserve have been obliged to be alled out in order to keep the regiments even at their peace complement. The exertions of the regimental surgeons have, for the present, succeeded in mastering the epidemic and, if no new outbreak 2ccurs, it may be looked on already as in a fair way to disappear. The same seems to be the case with the sickness which has affected the horses of the avalry in Potsdam. Very shortly after they were iistributed throughout the surrounding villages it. became apparent that they were recovering so rapidly that they will soon be able to be brought back to their own stables and do duty. What the nature of this affection of the horses has beejl I have not been able to learn. In Denmark also the same causes, viz., lengthened irought and excessive heat, bringing in their train vitiated air and want of water, have produced the same results, and the King has found it necessary to postpone the usual military exercises :f his troops site die, and to send back to their homes aU the men of the reserve, &c., who had been called out for the purpose of these autumn manoeuvres. The cholera is also showing itself in considerable force in Holstein and in Sweden, as it has also done nearly aU this year in St. Petersburg; this, together with the very unsatisfactory sanitary state of Copenhagen, which is becoming rapidly worse, gives rise to very anxious apprehensions. The Danish public is even dissatisfied with the above-mentioned wise measulre of preventing the aggregation of troops in confined distrits, by dispersing those. already in barrack-, on the ground that in this way the virus of disease will be most rapidly spread from its foci to the utmost lrmits of the kingdom. The Danish FlyvepUsten states that our Government has inquired of the Danish War-office if there is any number of Danish m ilitary officers of. vari- DUS aOus who could just now be spared, and who would be willing to take service in India on advantageous terms and for a fixed period of five years. To Flyreposteu must, of course, be left the entire responsibility of the statement ; in its present shape its correctness is very questionable. A report now in cireulation, that the Emperor of Russia would arrive, at Halle on the 8th- inst., to be present at the mnanonvres of the Prussian 4th armnie corps iD the province of Saxony, and whither the Kirng3 anad Qneen set off yesterday afternoon, is3 whoub fondation. We know by means of the tegraph that the Emperor left Sr. Petersburg last Thursday for Warsaw, accompanied by Prince G ortsehakof, and that it was his intention to spe'jd several days in the Polish capital before arri viughere on the 14th inst.

THE lILITIA AND T1HR LINE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TllES. Sir,-Wili you pernit me through your columns to call the attention of the authorities to a circumstance which tends very materiaUy to paralyze the efforts of the recrniting partie3 dispersed throughout the country,-viz., the condition upon which men belonging to milia regimentg are permitted to enlist into the regular army ? Under existing regulations, before a militiaman can be enlisted, it Is neces3ary thatthe sanction of the Secretary for War shxU in each case be obtained by his commanding officer, a procoss which usuaUy occapies some three woeek; added to which, if he has not been embodied, he is compeUed to pay the sum of 18s. 6d. for his discharge. I need not point out that this has practically the effect oE preventing the very class of men wvho are not only the most eligible, but the most likely to offer themselves, from joining the ranks of our army. Common sense, surely, demands that every facility should be afforded these men to embrace * sernice for which their previous career may be fairly presumed to have given them a tasto and in some measure to have qualiiled them. Indeed, one would have thought that an additional inducement in the way of boanty ought to ba held out to them, Instead of their being obliged (in some cases) to forfeit nearly one-half of the ordinary bounty, dmply because they had during the late war served their couatry. It has been decided that all the Militia are not to be called out, because, as Lord Palmerston justly rematks, It would be paying a heavy price to embody the Militia of the united kingdom for 56 days on the chance of obtaining a few volunteers. Let an order be issaed directing L free discharge to be at once granted to every militiaman desirous to enlist on his being found I'fit; for the service, and offer a double bounty (41, instead of 24) to such men as have been embodied 12 months, and I have no fear that a sufficient number of volunteers will be obtained to meet the present emergency. I am, Sir, your obedient seovamt. A PRACTICAL RECRUITERL

FOREIGN INTBLLIGEBNB. THE DANUBIAN PRNOWIPA.ITIES. (RoM ou0 ow: coEmsowma.) fA porion of the foUowiDg appeaed in our aod btion of yesterdzy -] BUCHAREST, AuG. 28. Your readers of course imagine that, as the Goverunents of France and Englaind have come to an understanding about the Pzinoiplities, and as even the foreign Representatives at onatantinople have deigned to approve, or rather acquiesce for the moment in that arrangement, things wilM now go on smoothly, and they will hear no more of diplomatic squabbles. Do not let them be lulled into a dangerous security, fcr they may be soon again roused out of it in a most unpleasant manner. One of the first difficulties will be to start the Commission again. It sticks fast, something like a heavy country waggon in this deep alluvlal sql after a few weeks of autumnal rains. The four Cbnni&isoners of France, Russia Prussia, and Sardini have protested against the Divan elected for MKAdavia, and the Austrian Commissioner has protested against this protest. Thus the Commi.ion is bottled up, like the Afrits in the VThoscasd and Onew Nights, and sealed w-ith a double seal as strongly put on as Solomon's, if not quite so wisely. This interdiot has not been takeni oR set. When the Turkish Commimioner received the iaews that the Porte had consented to annul the elections for Moldavia he invited the Coommiioners to a semi-official meeting, as he had important news to communicate to them. All promised to come except the Austrian, who declared that as the protests had not been withdrawn he could not take part in anyact of theCommission as abody. Now, if common sense oould bepermitted to penetrate -such matters of transcendental depth, it wodld probably conclude in its usual blunt and unsophisticated manner that, as the cause which had led to the protest of the four Powers had ceased, the, protest had likewise ipso fadeo ceased, and, as there was thus no first protest, there could be no second protest either. All the Commissioners received the news that the Porte had annulled the elections at the samo time, so Ignorance of the removal of the cause of the protests could scarcely be pleaded. Thix protest and counter protest are thus an intrIcate love-knot, and one or the other party must make the first step to untie it. As neither seems for the present inclined to do so, the proposition'to adjourn the Commission till after the eleclions in Wallachia and the new elections in Moldavia are over was eagerly accepted by all parties. There is, besides, another reason which induced the Commission to look favourably at such a proposal, and this was the false position in which they are placed with regard to the elections. From the time of its arrival the Commision was looked upon by the Moldo. Wallachians as the sole arbiter of their destinies, as an authority which for the time being had superseded aU other authority. Every grievance which arose was brought before the Commissioners, and every wish they had was conmnunicated to hem. While they were thus reg,arded as the centre or suns, they were in reality only like sickly moons, turning round the A mbassadorial sun at Constantinople and borrowing their light from it. They had no real ower, and every question had to be referred to Stamboul, while alL the time they stood a fair chance of being accused by the people here of everything which went wrong. Certainly this was no very agreeable position, and It can scarcely be wondered at if the Commissioners seized the first opportunity to get out of it and leave the elections to their fate; but it may be questioned whether thin was the best way to get out of the existing difficulties. Not only will this suspension of theCommission during the electionsbelookedupon by the Moldo-Wallachians as a desertion of their cause, and as a convenient mode to put an end to all grievances and reclamations which might arie during the elections, but It wiU prove likewise a great drawback in any case of doubt or misunderstanding which may occur. You are aware, for instance, that aceoidiag to the agreement made at Constantinople the Porte consents only to a conditional application in Moldavia of the modifications of the firman made for Waachia-as far, namely, as local circumstances admit of such rn application. Now who is to decide about these local circumrstances ? Unless all parties have been suddenly changed and been influenced by a spirit of conciliation which they have by no means shown hitherto, a new dispute is unavoidable. This can be so much the less avoided as the explanations which have been given do not touch all the doubtful points of the firman. First among these is the question of the Greek monasteriea. As it is probable that you will hear often of these monasteries, it will not be amiss to explain to your readers their position. At different epochs both the Hospodars and private individuals have made donations of landed property to different foreign convents of renown, with the obligation to pray for their souls and to apply the revenues derived from this pro. perty to various charitable purposes. In the lapse of time and its vicissitudes the charitabie purposes -were by degrees forgotten, and only the revenues faithfully kept, so that at this moment they may in both countries be assumed to amount to 60C,0001. sterling. All this large revenue is free from taxes and every other interferen,ce of the local Governments, and is administered by a species of farmers, who mlke their agreement with the convents to which the different properties belong. The firman orders that the administrators of these monasteriesasrepresentingauchlargelandedproperty should have the right of choosing two lay members and natives to represent their interests. This disposition did not suit them at all, as it endangered their exceptional position, and their participation in the Divan implied their subjection to the laws of the country. The Metropolitan of each of the two counltries had to make out the lists of the clergy. Both the Metropolitans, glad to have an opportunity to bring the Greek monasteries,or rathertheirrevenues, under their jurisdiction, put the superiors, or administrators of them, on the list as electors; but the remonstrances of the Greek monasteries, sup],orted as they were by the Patriarch at Constantinople and by Russia, made the Metropolitan of Wallachia waver, and up to this moment, although the elections are at hand, the question is not decided in Walachia. In Moldavia, on the contrary, the Eaimak-an rejected the proposal of the MetropolItan to admit the superiors of the Greek monasterial lands as electors, under the plea that they were foreigners not naturalized, and therefore not qualified to vote. According to his interpretation the firman meant by "monasteries dedicated to foreign holy places" only to represent in the Divan convent property which is not under the control of the State; and, as there are two such monasteries in Moldavia, that of Nyanitz and Vorona, the superiors of these two convents were declared deputies by right in the Divan. The question is of no smaU Importance to the two countries, for upon its decision depends whether such large revenues as those of the Greek monasteries shall remain exempt from all jurisdiction of the country from which they are drawn. If the superiors of these monasteries vote and choose their two members for the Divan, they have vir tually acknowvledged the Divan, and cannot help submitting to whatever may be decided by the majorit there, while if they can escape this. dangerouw franchisethey willhave asserted theirindenendA,uce. I need not tell you that Russia is an- Ons fortJhe latter result, and she comes therefore into collision with the TJnionist party, who are just as anxious for the contrary result. When the hIetropolitan of Moldavia sent in his grievances against the interpretation of the firman by Vogorides, one of the chief points was his interpretation of the article referring to the Greek convents, by which they would have been omitted from the list of voters, and thus left in their independence. This was sufficient for the Russian Commissioner torefuse the presentation of the petition, as he had been requested to do by the Metropolitan, and the French Comilnoner undertook it, but from one or other reason this document has not been presented hitherto. From this specimen you may judge of the intricaoy of any question which arises here, and of the difflerenoe of intereaweven among those who seem to work together. There are elements for endlesa complieations, and you wil see, as the work of the Co1misloin progresses, if it does not come to a pre- mature end, that there will be a continual chaning of aides. Already the signs of this begin to be apprent, and it is not difflcult to see that the affair of the Principalities is on the point of entering a newr phase. I should not wonder if the enene at Osborne would be found in thq 'equel to form thie satng point of this newo cbkbalon; the unnatural combination hitherto existing was baed on the disunion of France and England, and the entenke between the two may form a prominent feature in the new combination. Th1i1s nothing like the union of the two Western Powers to exorcise all evil spirits from Eastem affairs, and no language Is strong enough to brand those who sow disunion between the two. ITALY.

ASUENT OF MONTE ROSA. TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TThEES. Sir,-We left the Riffel Hotel at 2.20 a.m. eon Friday, the 28th of A ugust, and reached tho plateau In two hours. Here the guides took some refreshment, and the real businems of the day began. The snow was in excellent order, and, the day having novr dawned, we walked on at a tolerably rapid pace for three hous. We breakfasted on the snow, under an Impromptu tent, nade of plaida, supported by Alpen-stooks, and after a halt of haif an hour pursued our upward course until we reached " tho saddle." From this point the snow lies on a ridge as steep as the roof of a house. HIere we were tied together, and we had to grind away in the snow for 20 minutes, when we arrlved at the arcte, or orest of the mountain. The rocks which compose this crest are so pointed that the snow cannot lie on them, and occasionally you have to stad on a ledge scareely wide enough to put your foot on, with a precipice of 1,500 feet, on one gide and 3,000 or 4,000 feet on the other. After having threaded our way for some hundred yards 4long this awnte we gained the objeot of our ambition the " Hochste Spitze," at 10.30 anm., and thus reiched the summit in eight hours and ten minutes-one of the quickest ascents, I believe, that has ever been made. Our.party at khe top consisted of Mr. Darroch, Mr. Parker, a French gentleman, and myself; three other gentlemen who started with us we left considerably behind, but two of them eventually attained the summit. The view was glorious, comprising all the high Alps of Switzerland to the north and the plains of Lombardy to the south. The Ortler Spitze, in the contre of the Tyrol, formed a sort of boundary to the eat, the Monte Viso aud the rugged peaks of Dauphin6 to the west. The Italian laks were spread out at our feet, and the excellent eyesight or vivid imagination of our French companion discovered the blue waters of the Adrlatio I I felt none of the inconveniences alleged to be tho fate of those who ascend l1,OOO feet and upwards, ex. cept that one of my hands was slightly frost-bitten. We descended to the plateau in two hours, and at half-past 3 p. m. were received at the Riffel Hotel by a party of friends who had watched our progress with a telescope. As much has been sid about the exorbitant sums demanded and paid for ascending Mont Blano, it may be well to tate the exact sUm this ascent cost us. We had one guide each, which is enough for good walkers who are accustomed to snow and ice; and the whole thing oost us 65f. per head (very little over 21. lOs.b a small sum for such a magnificent excursion-one which I recommend to my mountrymen, but not to my fair countrywomen, although one made the ascent this year. The ladies, I think, had better confine themselves to the Cima de Jazzl, a beautiful mountain, oommanding nearly the same view as Monte Rosa, and ascended without diffllulty,-in fact, a sort of Oaks day as oompared to the Derby. Our chief guide was the celebrated Matthaus zam Tangwald ; our second, Peter Behren, one of the most promising young guides in this nedghbourhood; the third, a man from the Oberland, was knocked up, and oould not reach the summit. The Frenchman had his own guide, so Mr. Parker, Ar. Darroch, and myself had only two guides between us daring the most difiicult part of the acent. B. W. ElUoT FOBSTER. Zermatt, Sop'. L

THE PATRIOTIC FUND AND IVDI" BUF. PEBEBS. TO THE EDITOR OF THEl TIMES. Sir,-Seeing tbhat the kindly feeling of the country Is promptly turning its humane attention to the widows and orphans of those who are being murdered in Upper India, may I ask what are the Commissioners of the Patriotic Fund able to do In such a critical moment? Over 1,200,0001. have been banked for the use of the sufferers by the last war with Russia producing an annual revenue of about 60,0O0O., out of sundry investments, all wIsely arranged. I calculated, from the report of the Royal Patriotic Fand Commissioners, dated May, 185r6, that their pensioners u to that period involved an annual expenze of about 27,0001. -certainly then under 30S,0004-andof coure decreasing every month, week, andl day. Some large sums, unauthorizedl by tho spirit of the QtLeen's letter, were granted by the CommIssoners to milii. tatry and naval scheo&-a piece of liberality I would not object to; only I failed, ashon. seocreary to a local Patriotic Fund Comnittee, in obtaining relief for theo °h daughter of a naval offther whose brother and chie suppoung young officer of great promise was drowned wlea layug out an anchor to save Hler WMjestys ship Polyphemus, wreocked at night in the rnenxth of December on, thle coast of Joitland. The objection mnade to her claim was, that "1the young ladly had another brother a lieutenant in the navy I" I nevex forgave this piece of " red tape," coming from &uch a quarter. I am, however, ready to afford my mite and assistance to the sufferers from the terrible IndiAn 3mutinies; but I want to see how far the plus 30,0001. a-year of the Patriotic Fend will first go to meet the calamity, feeling that the Coimmissioners should be stirred up at once in performing their duty in the matter.

PIous GAMBLMS.-One of the most amusing instances of external piety we remember to have witnessed was in a Madrid club, where every night, towards 12 o'clook, a rouge-ct-oirtable opens. Occasionally it has happened that when the gamo was at the hottest, the table strewn with gold and notes, eagerness to be read on the flushed countenances that craned over the green cloth, there was heard in the street without the tinkle of the bell that announces the passage of the Host. Instanitly the game was szspended, the gmnblers knelt- upon their chairs or on the fioor, and crossed themselves and mumbled prayers while the consecrated wafer passed on its way to some dying man's bedside.

C2ANQADA. LIVERPOOl4 TUESDAY. The Montreal Oeean Steamship Company's steamer Anglo-Saxon, M'Maater, commalade?; has arrived from Quebec, with advices to the 29th ult., and 210 passengers The Royal Mail steamnhip America, hence, had arrived at Boston. On that day ehe puased off the lower end of the Island of Orleans the bark Niagara and the ship Transatlantic, bound down, and off Brandy Pots the ship Birkenhead, also bound down; -and the Inkermann, with emigrants, bound up. On the 30th, at 7.30 a m., off Point de Monts, she fell inwith the brig Louis Ferrier, having on board the passengers of the screw-steamer Clyde, from Quebec to Glasgow, to the number of about seven cabin and 60 steerage and intermediates, which vessel had struck upon the low craggy rocks of the Paraguettes in the Gulf of St. Lawrgnce. The following ara the paticulars relative to the accident, which, fortunately, was unaccompanied by any loss of life:- At 10 a.m. on the morning of the 23d, the day after the Clyde left Quebec, she was abreast of Cape de Monts, distant upon seven miles, whence she took a fresh departure, steering east for the west point of Anticosti. During the forenoon the weather was calm and cloudy, but a fresh breeze from thneeaatward sprang up in the course of the afternoon, and towards night, and it rained pretty. heavily, mostly in a thick drizzle. Darkness set in without the land being made ; but calculating the course steered and the distance run, the position of the steamer was, about midnight, supposed to be near the entrance of the Canadian Channel, and on the Anticosti side of it. Tne ship's head was then hauled up gradually to the south-east; but she had only proceeded on that course a few minutes when she struck heavily on a rock and heeled over to the port side. Three bells, 1.30 a.m., had just struck, the look-out man had reported " All's well I" and the captain was watching on- the bridge, when the concussion, which was very severe, was felt. There was not any fear felt of irnuediate danger, and the general impres3ion was that there would only be a detention. In less than a quarter of an hour, however, after the vemel had heeled to port she was making water fast abaft, and evidently sinking. The captain imnmediately is3ued orders in the most cool and prai-sewrorthy manner for the preservation of the llves of his passengers; the boats were manned and lowered as if nothing amtraordinary had occurred, and the passengers pased Into them without confasion or may, every one being placed in temporary safety before hi left the wreck. Within twenty minut after the vessel struck her stern was entirely under and the cabin full of water, but so slight was the feeling of alarm, especiall amongthe cabin passengers, that they were actually packing up their clothes and getting out their money against emergency, and it was not until she made a final lurch to port, filling that side of the cabin, that- they beguan to consider their personal safety. All being safely packed in the boats, a supply of provisions and water were put on board of each, and they lay off the wreck until daylight. When it was revealed, through a still mist, the position of the vessel was at once apparent, the low craggy rocks and Islets of Paraguettes being visible all round. Tha captainatonceheadedthe line of boatain the lifeboat, and by keeping close order, and steering to the north, in the course of two hours made the mala land, but the surf being too high to land he followed the coast easterly until reaching the Hudson's Bay port at Mingan,! where the party were moat hospitably receine d and sheltered by Mr. Henderson, the agent of the company, who threw open his house and buildings, and placed every article he had at the captain's disposal. A party, headed by the captain, afterwards returned to the wreck to save as much property as possible. That which belonged to the steerage passengers, and which was stowod forward, bieng above water, was saved to soms extent, but all the proty aft was lost. The Louis Ferrier, a smal brigantine of about 70 tons, the property of Mr. James Scott, of Quebec, which happened fortunately to be in the offing, wai engaged to take the passengers and crew to Quebec, and a supply of water and provisions was put on board of her; but the weather proved unfavourable, and she was detained until the 28th ilt., on which morning she got under way with no less than 120 people on board. On the morning of the 30th, about 7.30, the Anglo-Saxon having hove in sight off (Jspe de Monts, Captain- Meikleried immediately put off in his life-boat to intercept her, and, the brigantine showing a signal of distrese at the main, steered acro3s her track. The commander of the Anglo Saxon perceiving that something wav wrong, bore down on the life boat, and shortly after ran alongside the brigantine, from whlch he took all the shipwrecked passengers, whom he amply supplied with many comforts they much re4ulred. It Is stated that the numerous wrecks aun3ually occurring in the Gulf of St. Lawrence might have been obviated if proper lights had beei} established1 along the coast; and that lt isarcatter of regret toallI acquainted with the navigation, that so important a point as the west point of Anticosti, and several others of equal importance, where buildings for the purpose have actually been erected for nearly two years, should stil be unprovided with lights. A rumour,which gained currency in Kingston, to the effect that the 9th Regiment, stationed in that city, was to be despatched to India, created much excitement among the men, and several of them deserted to the United States. On the morning of the 24th ult. the entire garrison guard, consisting of a sergeant and eight men, deserted, carrying five stand of arms and ammunition with them. They got away by taking one of the officer's boats, but before leaving they scuttled all the other boats so as to prevent a pursuit. The Montreal Traipt, alluding to the rumoured departure of troops, says:- " It is stated in well-informed quarters that the wlhole of the regular troops now in this province will shortly be withdrawn for service in India, and that orders from headquarters to that purport are expected to arrive by next rnail. Should this be so, there is every probability that the active force will be required to do permanent duty, or that, failing this, immediate steps will be taken to raise and equip one or more provincial regiments." A St. John's (New Brunswick) paper mentions the failure of Mr. Joseph Fairweather, whose liabilities were estimated at from 30,0001. to 70,0001. The railway between Shediac and Moncton had been opened. At Quebec the timber-market was r-ebdingly dull. The quantity of timber in first hauds for sale was unusually large, but on the other hand the stock in the hands of shippers was moderate. iBusiness in general produce was also dull. At New York on the 28th ult, fiour was dull and declining. Prime wheat was scarce and firm. Stocks were dull and heavy. Money was in good demand at 7 per cent. on call. The New Yorkl Courier anud Inquirer of the 26th has the following remarks on the state of commercial matters - " Some few partie,s who had advanced largely upon railroad securities now depreciated have been compelled to suspend payment in this city. These failures are, however, few, and may be said to be wholly conf'ned to those who have gone out of the legitimate oourse of bankers, and have taken too heavily of one species of public securities. But the effect upon our city is small. Wall-street is not lNew York. Take all the assets of all the guspended parttes and of all the raifroad corporations whoes paper they hold, and the aggregbate i but as I a drop in the buc}et.' TLe r-eal effect O far is to create serious inCOnveDienCe to a clas of bankers in the West, who had entrusted their Niw York funds to the parties under protest Tho amounts held by our city banks and bankers (assuming it at $1,000,000) affect but in an extremely small degree the business of Wall-street itself ; and, as to other part of the oity, it need not be thought of. We should not revert to the great, the important, the all-powerful interestsof commerce, under such a money stringency as prevails At the moment, and at the moment only. We find our manufacturers closelY engaged in filling or executing orders from all parts of the country at large. Every department of internal trade is active and remunerative also. The coountry is abundantly prosperous from the Atlantic to the Paoific. Labonr is in demand everywhere, from Maine to California - and this labour is well repaid. The planter at the Soutii and tho planter at the West iz reaping a rich harvest; and If Wallstreet were blotted out of existence to-day the pormanent interests of the conntry 'would scaroely feel the change. As to the ability of the mercantie olasses to sustaan their crodit, it is conceded that they have never been stronger. Payments from the West and South have been puctual this season, and those regions are fast becoming creditors instead of debtors to the Commercial metro lis. We hear that liberal orders have been received from Enland for breadatuffs from this quarter. Lower pres will, It is true, be realized, but it is well known that thevrin producers of the West can compete with the whole as to quality, quantity, and price of the cereal produots. If our farmers cannot get $2 or $1 75 per bushel for wheat. they 'will realize a profit at $1 or $1 25. All the combined efforts of England to produce cotton in India have faled, and the United States must for 20 years to oome supply Western Europe with this great staple. On the whole, there are no grounds for fear, either financially or commercially. A few weak houses will probably suspend during the week or month, but the city at large is abundautly oiroxg and rich,"

Dove had served his apprentieesbip as a sationer with Mesrs. Newsomo and Lennox, of LeeI, and was sub- sequently an assistant to Mtr.

Stanfield soon suspected the true nature of the transaction, and having communicated with the Low Moor Company, his fears wver confirmed, and he bAfosmed MTr. Leveratt, chief-constable, and deteotive Shuttleworth of the matter. In the meantime, however, another communication was forwarded by rail from Leeds to Mfr.

AocmrN ow TBE Soum-Eas ax RAIwLY. -On Monday afternoon an ccddent took place at the Margate Station of the South-Eastern Railway. The excursion train from the Bricklayers' Arms Station arrived at Ramggate sbortly after half-pust 12, and a few minutes after that hour the Margate portion of the train, consisting of four open excursion carriaSes, left tne Ramsgate Stxtion for Iargate. About 10 minutec before 1 o'lock Sho train was observed in sight of the ticket platform, when Mz. Bamnel the atationmaster, perceived that the train had ascended the inCline towad the sXtaton at this point, and wreg approaching at more than itg ordinry veloc[ He shouted to those whom he supposed tobe in chxrge of the train to apply the breaks, but no response was made, nd the train came daRhing on into the station, and, having reached the end of the line, came in collision with the " bufferm." As the train entered the station th6 occupants of the carriages, which were quite fnll, began to get up and prepare to leave tho train, and consequently when the shock took place they were kno^ked ngainst each other, many receiving severe contusions about the head, face, and various parts of the body. As soon as the confusion created by the collision had subsided, Mr. Barnett, seeing that several of the passengers had received cuts about the head and face, lost no time in sending for Dr. Hunter and Dr. Hoffman, two surgeons of the town, who dressed the cuts and wounds of those who had been injured. It was speedily ascertained that, although the occurrence had created considerable oensternation, no serious injuries had been sustained; some few of the passengers were, however, compelled to remain with their I friends. On instituting an inquiry the inexplisable cilrcum. stance was brought to light, that the guard whose duty it was to have come through with the train left it at Ramsgate, and there was no one to put the breakh on in the train. SoUTrEHA2Prox, Tuesday.-The splendid new Screw steamship Australasian, built for the European and AustraHan Royal Malf Company, of which a fall description was published in Te Timas about three weeks ago, arrived here to-day from the Clyde, and was immediately taken into graving dock. She saUed from the Clyde at 4 o'clock on I nday afternoon, and arrived about midday at this port. The Australasian is a magnificent vessel, and has been Inspected during the afternoon by a large number of nautical men,
COMMODORE KEPPEP IN TEH OANTON ArVBR. We are permitted to publish the following private letter from Commodore the Hon. H. Keppel, O.B., giving ome details of the boat action on the 1st of June, and other particulars, which will interest those who have friends in China. We regret to hear a renewed rumour that the gallant Commodore is ordered home from this sta tion. His late misfortune (as to which he has beenL acquitted of blame) and his later gallant performances againmt the enemy might have been expeoted to scure to him the advantage of continued active employment in the East. " Alliator, Canton River, June 20. "The three weeks of this mouth have been falU of excite. ment, We commenoed on the lst with as pratty a boat action a any ever recorded In our naval history, though It may never be appreciated, because it was fought in Chia. The troops are now, unfortunately, required for India, and I suppose we shal not get them before the summer is over. So much the better for them, as it is broiling hot jnst now. In the meantime we have to keep the Canton river open for them, itbeing their high read to the Ceesftil city, which I euppose they will have to occupy before Lord 1gmin attempt to bring Commissioner Yeh to terms. I am left here in conis mand of the river, the fort of Chucnpee, which I took pos. session of on the 18th, being my boundary at one end, and tbe M3aca Fort at the other. They are about 40 miles apart; Chucapee Is about that distance from Hongkong, ad Mo is tbree miles from the city of Canton; aU the intermediate forts have been demolished, and on the 1st we polihed off the remainder of their war fleet, about 180 Imperial war junks, eo that I now hold uncontroUed possedon Our worthy chief-and a fine fellow he is-remains with his ship at Hongkong, paying us occasional viits in one of tbe smaller steamers. I have 17 ships, containing about 2,600 men, attioned at different distanoes; and, this being the anniversary Of Her Wajety's accesion, they are AU dressed out with flags, and at noon Commissioner Yeh wil be edified by Royal salutes fired the whole length of the Imperla river from Canton to below the Boguo Forts. My poor Ralelgh no longerbelongs to Her Majesty's navy, and the Admiral has appointed my. self and all the offioers to the AlUigator, and given us three vessels to man as tenders. I live in the Hongkong, hut oome here to sleep-when not moving about, this old hulk being a sort of fixture. My steward keeps mes, and wre all grub together-iz., Lieutenant Goodenough, Dr. Crawford Princo Victor, Autey (my secretary), Lord Cbar]es Scott: Montague, and Harry Stephenson. Welae very happy and jolly, and the temporary arrangement is a very good one. We thought we were going to have a little fight the other day, as the Admiral had ordered me to take posession of the Chuoupee Fort. We moved down to do so in good order en the morning of the 18th, but the enemy guessed what they might expect, and very wisely ' hooked it.' I am id this is the last little affair that is likely to occur this summer. I have atationed the veseels under my orders at different distances all the way up. The upper part of the river is not considered so healthy as the wider part down here, so that I have them relieved every fortnight. There are two islands near where we are anchored, where the men and offloers of the ships near assemble every evening, aqd play at quoits and aU sorts of games. In fact, time seems to fly fast, and the mails going and ooming every fortnight keep us all alive. Tumour, in command of the Bittern, is now taking his turn up at the front, whch, aithough les3 healthy, in the favourite poet. They are obliged to be continually on the alert, and look out for fire rafts and all sorts of Infernal machines. 1 generally visit them once a week in the Hongkong. I hope somebody gave you a good account of our boat fight on tho 1st of June. It must have been a beautiful sight to those who witnessed It from the heights. The shallow water obliged the Hongkong to groand, when she wouldother. wise have been in front of everything; bat when bho groundedIled on the boatsinmy gig; but as the tide was rising the Hongkong kept following us as fast as she could The first division of the Chinese fleet were simultaneousl attacked by about 1,900 men, spread over a lArge surfae, and soon gave ray; but I did not take up moro than a quarter of that number to attack their second division, which was three miles higher up the river, in a wllU seIected place, and evidently the daie of their fleet. They numbered exactly 20 in one oompact row; they mounted from 10to 14gunseach, two of them in stern and bow being heavy 32-pounders. I saw that I had all the Raleigh's boats well up, and determined to push on. They fired occasional shots, as if to ascertain our exact distanoe, but did not open their heaviest fire until we wren within 6OO yards and then I soon saw how imposible it would be to foroo our way until I had reinforcements. Nearly the first poor fellow whose head was knocked off was an amateur-Major Kearney. I had known him many years. We cheered, and I tried to get on, when a shot struck my boat right amid. ships, cat one man in two, and took off the arm of another. Prince Victor, who was with me, jumped forward to bind the man's arm up with his neckeloth. While he was doing so, another round shot passed through both sides of the boat, wounding twro others of the crew. The boat was filling with water, and I got on one of the seats to keep my legs out of the water, and just as I stepped up a third round shot went through both sides of the boat not more than one inch below the seat on which I was standing. Many of our boat had now got huddled together, the oars of most being shoI away. A bout of tho Calcutta being nearest, we got in, puling our wounded men with us. MY dog '-Mike' refusing to leave the dead body of the man who had been his favourite, we were obliged to leave him. I then gave the order to retire on the Hongkong, and re-form abreast of her. While we were going down a shot crLt away all the oars on one side. I called to Lieutenant Graham to get his boat ready, a I would hoist my broad pendant and lexd the next attack in his boat. I had no sooner spoken than a shot disabled his boat, wounding him and killing and wounding four others. I saw Graham one mass of blood, but it was from a marine who stood next to him, and part of whose skull was forced three inches into another man's shoulder. When I reached the HoDgkong the whole of the enemy's fire appeared to be centred upon her. She wa5 hulled 12 times in a few minutes; her deck was covered with the wounded who had been brought on board from the boats. I was looking at them when a round shot cut dow a marine, and he fell among them. From the paddle-box I saw that our heavy firing was now bringing up a strong reinforcement. The account of my having been obliged to retire had reached them, and they were pulling up like mad TheHongkong had floated and grounded again. I ordered a bit of blue bunting to be got ready to represent my broad pendant; I called out, ' Let us try the row-boats once more, bos,' and went over the side into our cutter (the Raleigh's), in which was Tmmour, the faithfal Sprrier bringing the bit of blue flag.At this moment there arose from the boats, as if every man took it up at thesame instant, one of those British cheers so fulU of meaning thea I kner at once that it was all up with John Chinaman. They might sink 20 boats, but there were 30 others who would go ahead all the faster. On we went. It was indeed a lovely and exdting sight. I saw the move among the junks. They were breaking ground and moving off, the outermost first. This manouvre they performed in beautiful order. They never ceased to fire. Three more cheers, and then commenced an exciting chas-e for seven miles. As our shot told on them they ran on shore, and their crewsforsook them. Seventeen were come up with and captured this way, three only escaped. It was in this last chase that my poor Spurrer was shot down by my dde. I sAw his bowels proetrude as he lay in the botiom of the boat holding my hand. Ile asked mo .f I thought there was any hope. I could only say, ' Where thero is life there is hope but I had none. Strange to w&y, the good Crawford sewed him up, and the Admiral's lat letter from Hongkong states that Spurrer hoped to return to his duty in a few days. What a long yarn I hae spun you; but as I began the little affair came fresh to my memory, end I have filled no end of paper all about self. My own prospects- for the future I cannot gue at, but, going on with self, I may be allowed to say to you, whom It is so sure to gratify, that the Admiral speks highly of my services in tho late boat affair. Whether ho overrates them or not is not my business, but I do think that they ought to insure my continued employment out here, even should I be on the flag list. There is a fleet out and coming sufficiently large for two admirals. Isee the Fronch have rewarded my services in the Crimea bigher than our own Government has done. " July 7.-These Chinese rascals still give us enough to do. We are supposed not to interfere with the trade, so that hundreds of vessels pass daily up and down the river, but piratical boats and all sorts of rascals get in among these traders, who quarrel and attack one anothor, so that It is difficult for us to distinguish the trader from the pirato. There are other long rowboats carrying 60 men each, and mounting gnns, that are sent out by the Mandarins to intercept the trade to Hongkong. Sunday was a caln, and many of these fellows were out. I sent a gunboat in the evening. Dnring the night sbe returned, bringing two fellows (traders), whom she caught fighting. Yesterday morning I ser.t the gunboat and Hongkong again away; and, as I had the caso of these traders to investigate, I did not go myself, but sent Sir Robert 'ltCLre, the Captain of the Esk-, with his boats. He chased a row-boat up one creek, while the Hongkong, onr tender, went after another. The land was low, so that I could see thelr masts all day, and see and hear their firing. M'Clnre, in his gig and with hik launch, folowed h4 chase up an inner creek, and on his xuddenly coming on a war junk they (tbs junk) opened fire and klled and wounded tenol hb men in the launch. Of omrs, hie ataeked thetn aPain -hen his otherboatscame up, and captured boakts, junk, and *11; so here ha been a small affair md I not in it, bn those re our musementg. "I really do not requir your ladlike caution 'not to be rash.' It is A real fact that your suspected firieater re. tired from a podftion he had taken up, and hi4ought his boataup a second time in reglar ctder, when the ches of our lads would have swelled the heart of braver men than John Chinaman; but all this I shall hope to fight over again w th you at home.

I hope aof:e day to plant it on the walls of the Celoeal city, where the ' Braves,' aa they call themselves> shall respect it. I will now, in conclusion, give you a copy of a letter to me, equally gratifying in its way. I am sure my dear friends at home will agree that it ought to be so:- "F oF RO-ARA3xnmL SIR 3M SzyMo.

IRO.N TIANSPORTS TO THE EDITOB OF TEE TIMES. Sir,-As the question of iron transporth is one of national imortnce, perhaps yo ill permii me to notice the two letters on the subject which appeared in your impresdon of Saturday. It is quite clear thst the Govermoent must takeadvantago of every available ship in the present juncture, and forward troops to India as rapidly as they can be got ready. There Is nothing in my letter of the st which can be construed into an objection to a course so presdng, and I have no doubt the troops which have been despatched in these ships will resch India In perfect safety. That is not the question It is clear that in future we must maintain a foroo of 100,000 men in India. The annual reliefs of such a force will run from 15 to 20 per cent. I think the Government ought to convey these troops in their own ships and that they sbould not be built of iron. There is a wide differenoe between the Government in an emergency employing ships to which a oertain objection applies, and heooming owners of such ships themelve Both your correspondents quote the Great Britain and "3L" quotes the Tyne as examples of the tenacity of iron ships, and being extricated from positions of great periL Now, I submit that neither of these cases is in point. The Great Britain grounded on smooth sand, and, although she did remain there for some months, she was protected from the soa by a regular breakwater, and was evontually saved, at an enormous expense, by the genius of Captain Claxton, and the varied appliance. which her vicinity to Llverpool enabled her ownen to bring to bear. The same observations apply to the Tyno; her vicinity to Southampton enabled her owners tolma3e the extraordlnary exertions which led to her salage; moreover, if I remember rightly, the Tyne did not ran on the rocks xtem on, bntgrounded on arock amidships and there hung, so the injury was con. finedto hermiddle compsrtment. But whore would these vessels have been had they got on shore further from their resources? As far as my experienoe goes, I should say that in 99 wooden ships out of 100 that run on rocks in moderate wether the people are sved, and the ships stick fast till they are either got of or break up on bad weather setting in, whereas I do not recollect hearing of one iron ship under the same circumstances that did not sink at onoe. The Orion sank within a few hundred yards of Portpatrick, when a number of people wero drowned. The Birkenbead has not been forgotten, and now the Transit. On the other hand, I may quote a case pretty nearly parallel to the latter, in which the result wain favour of the wooden ship. Early in 1818 the Aloests, a 38-gun frigate retumlng from China with Lord Amherst on board, at 7 30 am., going about seven knots, ran on a reef in Gaspar Straits, the entranco to the Clna Sea, east of Banca. There was a considerable surf on the reef, the dtaation being exposed to the monsoon; notwithstanding, the mnen were all afely landed, and ther was everyprospect of everything of value being got on shore, when they were attacked by swarms of MLalay pirates, who plundered and eventually burnt the ship; In 1821 her bottom was distinctly visible, and she did not finally disappear till three or four yeas afterwards. I merely cite this case as the occunrence took place in the same locality, and under vory sdmilar circumstances. It is impossible to draw any conclusion from an Isolated case of collision at ea; there are many chances whlch might give impunity to the weaker vesseL In conclusion I venture still to hope that the loss of the Transit will open the eyes of the Admiralty to the defects of iron transports, and that they will lose no time in disposing of those they have, or converting them to some other use, and adopt the plan of fitting line-of-battle ships for transport servioe. I remain, Sir, yours most obediently. J. D. EL ELPHI'STONE. I Wgi Elphinstone, Sept. f

MONEY-M.-BTan-d CITYINT TELLIG asR. TUesds.y Evering. The quotation of gold at P&arbs s about 5 per nlle premium, and the thort exchange ox. London is 25.22k per 11. sterling. On comparing these rates with the English Mint price of 31. 17s. l 4d. p. r ounce for standard gold it appears that gold is about 3-lOths pet- cent. dearer in Paris than in London. By adv;ces from Hamburg the price, *,f gold is 4 per mark, and the short exchange oit London is ]3.4 per 11. sterling. Standard gold at the EngliLsh Mint price iL therefore rather more than 2- lOths per cent. aearer in London than in Hamburg. The course of exchange at New York on London for bills at 60 days' sight is 1094 per cent., which, 'when compared with the Mint par between the two countries, shows that the exchange is slightly ln favour of England; and, after making allowance for charges of transport and difference of interest, the ptesent rate leaves a small protit on the impo:tation of gold from the United States. The English funds have again beeni dull to-day, but a decline of an eighth, which occurred at the opening, was recovered after regular hours. Consols for money which leit off yesterday at90to were quoted throughout the day, np to the official close, 904 to 4* Subsequently some transactions took place at 90, to i, whilo for the 14th of October the last rice was 90) to 91. Loans on Goverument sectrtties can stil be obtained till the next account without resorting to the Bank, but that establishment would make them upon application at 5j per cent. The transfer books of the New Three per Cents. closed to-day, and the last bargains in that stock were at 90k to 91. India Stock left off at 210 to 212; India Bonds, 20s. to 16s. discount; and Excheqjuer-bills, 5s. to is. discount. At the Bank and in the open market the demand for discount is active. The foreign stock-market has shown more animation, the transactions beingf unusually numerous, and prices, on the whole, are fairly supported.

In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rate upon Hamburg was a shade higher; for other places there was no alteration from last post. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 66f. 70c. for money and 66f. 90c. for the end of the month, showing a further decline of about an eighth. The advices received by the Brazilian mail this week appear to have further stimiulated the shipments of specie to that country which have been going on for many months past. The Teviot mail ateamer to-morrow takes out 108,3351. in sovereigns. A return has been printed to-day describing the changes made in foreign tariffs since the date of the similar return issued iu September, 1856. The countries by which alterations have been made are Russia, France, Spain, Austria, the Roman States, the United States, New Granada, Venezuela, Salvador, Montevideo, Buenos Ayres, and Peru. The Russian changes involve somee very large reductions from previous rates, but the new ones are still apparently so heavy as to be inconsistent in most cases with the growth of any extensive trade. The most important alteration is the removal of the prohibition against iron, which is now admitted at a duty of Gd. per 361b. for pig, and of from J.s. 4d. to 3s. on various descriptions of manufactured. The duties on cottons, silks, linens, and woollens have also been subjected to an average reduction of about 50 per cent. ; but whether these will henceforth yield any profit on importation is a point that can be determined only by practical experience. The minor alterations Include sugar, coffee, cochineal, pepper, porter, herrings, lead, tin, copper, quicksilver, zinc, rum, vinegar, earthenware, and china. The French reductions apply only to seven articles-fish, soda, wool, ginger, garance, oil, and sulphur. Spain has adopted several modifications, incltuding a reduction on some minor kinds of iron manufacture and some descriptions of silk and cotton cloth. But the tendency has been rather to impose new duties than to remove old ones, and a variety of mnisceUaneous articles, among which " printing types" characteris. tically figure, have been burdened with imposts which didnot previously exist. Austria haa made only a single alteration-namely, the removal of duty from looms for weaving or spinning. The tariff of the Roman States has been lowered with regard to several kinds of woollen, cotton, and linen manufactures, muslins, embroideries, articles of hair, wearing apparel, furs, soap, and books. The most important feature in the present return is the new scale adopted by the TJnited Stiates; about 440 articles are includled in ', and in all of these there has been a reduction. In most cases this reduction is equal to about 20 or 25 per cent., but in some instances it is as much as 90 par cant. New Granada and Veneztiela have made a great variety of changes, and almost entirely in an adverse direction. Montevideo, on the other hand, has effected considerable progress, a reduction of about 25 per cent. having been made in the duties on about 80 articles, some of them of much importance. In two instances, however, she has resorted to an increase-namely, wheat and linen and silk lace. Buenos Ayre has removed the duty from coals and lime, which are now free. On rat wool and furs she has increased it 50 per cent., while on silk and its manufactures she has lowered it 33 per cent. Peru has declared sugar, rice, butter, cheese, lard, and tallow free; also wheat if consigned to the pot-ta of Arica, Iquique, or Payta, while on flour she has made a reduction of 50 per cent. Salvador (Central America) has reduced her charges on all foreign goods from 24 to 20 per cent. ad valorem, establishing a decrease of more than 16 per cent. On the whole the results of the year may be considered to ahow that the cause of commercial freedom throughout the world is advancing Irresistibly, although slowly. It is pointed ont that if the offer of the European and American Steam Company to establish eight screw steamers on the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, so as to enable reinforcements to be regularly supplied to India by the overland route during the next Aix months, should be accepted, it would afford facilities for a weekly mail from that country, by the departures being arranged alternately with those of the Peninsular and Oriental vessels. The question, It is believed, is likely to be decided this week. The Star of Peace and Californian, which were appointed to leave Sydney on the 4th and 20th of June respectively, will, it is stated, bring, the former 91,522 sovereigns, and the latter 50,000. The following account of the silk-mnarket during the past month is from the circular of Messrs. Durant and Co. It indicates the effect of high prices and of the dulness in the various moneysarkets of the world in checking the consumption of this article The course of afaiurs in silk durinrg the last month has not been les dragging and unsatisfactor than in the two preceding, Buyers stilM hold off most determinedly froml any general business tansag only for their daily requh,. 3meats, notwithstanding the desire Of the importers to be doing iduced them first to be willing sellers Of all classe at the reduction previously egtablished for the lower claEeaes and within the last few days even at a f arther falL TXhe new silk isnowabout to be landed.

Italian silk commands no attention. Some Importers would doubtless accept soene modification upon their high pretenalonB but almost anything they could nameo would still leave their silk far bevond the point of competition with China and Bengal silk.' r

ArILWAY INTELLIGEOCZ. GLASGOW AND SOT_-VVvq r. '1he half-yearly meeting of this company was held on ionday in -lasgow, the Eon. Andrew Orr, lord Provost, The notice calling the meeting was read by the secretary, Mr. Fair(ull Smith, andthe report, an abstract of which ha ap,,ea edin 2c Tim>es, vas held as read. h CUAeTr asid the general business oF the company went on satisfactorily, the traffic being steadily on the increase, showing nearly 17,0001. inexocs, of the correspond. ing period of 1856. This, however, included 2,9(1. 4which Was in dispute as to adjustment of rates, but now arranged. Their Increase for the last two years had been very considerable, July 31, 1857, showing 57,0001. more than July 31, 185o, or an annual addition to theIr traffic return of about 25,0001. (Choers.) This would have placed them in a ver. favourablepositionhad their working expenses not kept pace with the prosperous state of their revenue. The directors felt disappointed at the large increase in this department, the principal items of which were maintenance of way, repair an) up-keep of plant, rates and taxes, and interest, nearly 8,0001. Relaying of part of the line bad absorbed nearly 7,OM ; but, as thi- waS necessary, and was a permanent improvement, it may be held as an addition to the capital of the com. pany. About 25 miles of the older part of the road had beenrecently, and during preceding halfyeart, renewed. They had only about 18 rniss yet to do, which the directors hoped-to overtake gradually out of revenue, on tho completion of which the rails of the line would be nearly as good as new. Bather than hurriedly swell the revenue, the Board thought it sounder policy to put the road and plant in thorough and perfect order, so that, when enabled to do so, any a;vance in dividend might be such as could be per. manentlymaintained and a further increase looked for. Hear, hear.) They had, however, resolved to make a strict.. nveatigation into the ordinary expenses, being satisfied that by this alone could the interests of the shareholders be secared. The high rate of interest still continued, but from the exoellent credit of the company the mortgage rate averaged only 41. p 9id. per centW. The long pending question as to the amount of toll payable to the Troon Rlalway Corn. pany beingnow etQedint eirfavourfrom5,0001. to6,000 wonld come to ths company, 4,5001. of which they had placed to the half-year's revenue, They hoped this adjus-. nient would lead to a more permanent arrangement between the two companies, smilar to the settlement with the Ardrossan, whereby the Troon Railway could be treated asa portion of the mainline, and the interestg of the Dnke ofPortlandand this compny at the mame time fairly protected. This would settl the last of their old difEculties, and give them the means of harmoniously working their entire railway. The directors wonld hive Xse fe ,ving a lare balance to carry forward pyrng the proposed dividend of 5 er oent., but, as the past half.year fqas always lower than the one they were now in, they anticipated greater ease at the end of the ensuing halfyear. ThI dividend from the Dalmellington line Was more han. they had anticipated, being 5 per cent., besides the advantage it brought to the main line. The worls on the Castle Douglas and Dumfries line were prooeeding with vigour, and there was every prospect of this being a valuable feeder to the southern end of their undertaking. The Bntish and Irish Junction (Castle Douglas to Portpatrick) would be commenced immediately, and would, no doubt, add greatly to the traffic of the neighbouring companies. They would naturally feel much more interested than heretofore in the proposed branch from Hawiok to a pointon the Caledonian near their Gretna Junction. From he large amotnt of the Irish and local trafic that would be brought to this point, it wu desirable and fatr that there should be the means of a free interchange, without any undue bar or toll, and this oould only be dcne by making Gretna the point of Junction. This would best serve the Interests of tne public, and bring, the southern counties of Scotlnd hIn direct communication with the Galloway district as wll as the north of Irelandand Portpatrlck. They therefore hoped that some arrangement might be oome toby the two companies who were contending for this project whereby Par.amennt,y conflich might be avoided, and the interests of the neighbouring lines be protected. The works on the laybole and Girvan line were being prooeeded with, and when completed would bring additional traffic over the wr portion of their road. He concludedby moving the Mr. JAMIEso2, the deputy-chairman, seconded the mo. Mr. BovD assked whether the increase of traffic was general over the whole line, or only in particular locs- The Carskxx said it might have increased in a greater degree where the traffic was heavy, but generally it had increased on an average over the entire line. Mr. BROUGH said he did not expect that the working expenses would have increased by an means to the extent they bad done. He had heard it sali that when a company were able to pay a dividend of fire per cent, they generaUy rested on their oa, and thought themselves entitled to be extra lberal; but he thought that it would require watch. ful manafement to enable them to keep 'he position they had gained. The C HAmr3 sald that the directors had reason to thank Mr. Brough for his advice. No one knew better or regretted more heo increas of working expenses than tha directors, and it was quite impossible that an immense traffic over 180 miles of railway cwuld be conducted without great outlay. They would do everything in their power to reduce the expenses, but he thought that the best thing they could do to increas the profitswould be to raise the rates. He thought they were working too cheap. Thereport vwsthen unanimously adopted, and a dividend at the rate of 6 per cent. was declared. It was al agreed that the ordinary capital stock held on behalf of the company, and capital stock which bad not been issued amountlug tO121,5231., be disposed of in terms of the recommendation of the report. TRhe meeting thenL separted. FU1NSS. Tbe report of the directors of this company states that the traffiefor the past half-year wrs very satisfactory, and they bad much pleaure in racommending a dividend at the rate of 8 per cent. per annum. They proaosed that a re terve fund should be estblished, and that 4,0001. be appro. pria'ed to It this half-year. The object of the fund is to meet the heavy outlay which will be required at BarrowPier where it Ig intended forthwith to substitute a wall for za portion of the present wooden pier, and also to meet any further renewals and contingencies that may arIse. The iron ore conveyed during the pest half-year has amounted to 287,000 tona, exceeding by upwards of 60,000 tons the puntity carried durin the corresponding half-year of l8S6. The gross recedpts for the half-year amount to 35,2881. Tho Ulverstone and Lancaster Railway was now open for public traffic, and the greater part of the 50,0001. agreed to be advanced to the uiverstone and Lancaster Company has been paid to them. A portion of the 50,0001. IS to remain deposited until the final settlement of accounts takes place between the two companies. Arrangements satisfactory to both parties have been entered into for working the Mlverstone and lancater Railway, and addi. tional rolling stock has been provided by - the urnes Company for the purpose. The act of Parliament for constructing a line of railway to Coniston, from tho terminus of the Hicrness Railway st Broughton, was granted last session. It Is Intended to proceed with the construction of the line Immediately, with the view of having it opened for traffic in the course of next year. The South Durham and Lancashire Union Railway wil connect the Stockton and Darlington -Railway with the lancaster and Carlisle Railway, and it , in the opinion of the directors, prove beneficial both to the Furness and to the Ilverstone and Lancaster Companies. The capital account showed that S3932l9 had been reoeived and 1009'61. expended, leaving a balance of 3,8367 The authorized capital amounts to 599,9331. The revenue accont for the hlf-year ending the 30th of June shows that 35,289L had beenreceived and 16,9611. expended, including 1,3471. for repairs of steamboats. The interest on debentures amounted to 2Z7241. and dividends on preference shares to 3,9371., leavinga balancec,with 3,9071.from the former account, of 16,5734. avafilble for dividend on the ordinary shares. DEW4AU1Y, OSES, AND WAKEFIEL). On Monda y a numerousy attended meeting of influential landed propHetors was held at Ossett to consider the best mneans of fuithering the appliecation to Parliament next sesEion for an Act to authorize the maing of the above-mentioudrallway.- The meeting had been convened by fr. Te r7, solldtor, Bradford, and others; Mr. Whittaker preside . Mr Terry gave a brief history of the last years efforts to get railway, and alo of the result of an interview of a respectadie deputation fronthe projectorg of the Wakefield and Ossett line last year with the London and NorthWestemRAilwyCompany inLLondon. From what took place there on that occasion, and from what Mr. Terry had been informed, he had the pleasure of stating that the inhabitaxte of the district tbrouah which the intended line would pass would present reqmsitions to the London and North-Western Board, and tht that company would at once put themselves in a position to apply for an Act and construct the line. As, therefore, the oidon and. N rthWestern last year had favorably supported the project with whichhe and others In the room were conected, and Ma that company, he( hid every reason to believe, were now prepared to construct the line, it was hoped the inhabitants of Ossett would render all the sapport they could to the company. Mr. F Bs w said that if It were ihe general wish of the inhabitants of the distric through which the intended line would pass, the Londoti and North-Western Company would, e was sure, rnake the Ifne. The announcement wraS reeived with cheerg, and a reql. sition was signed byJ all i*eeent.

THE ARCrTI EXPEDITIOK. TO TIE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Slr,-I have much plcasure In acquainting you that lettets have been received from Captain hi'Clintock, in the Fox, at Baal's River, in GreenlAnd, where he had put in for the purpose of sending home M. Lewis, one of his crew, who ws seized with spitting of blood, which rendered It advisable for him to leave the arctic regions as soon as poadble. The friends and retivges of thcse embarked, as wel as those who wish sucoess to the expedition, will be gratified to len that thus far the progrces made has exceeded our anticipation, and that In point of time he is 15 days in advance of Captain Inglefield, in his memorable voyage of 1852. The vessel is found to answer admirably well, and by means of steam forced her way through the pack into Frederlckshaal, where they replenished their coal and then proceeded to Baal's River, off the entrance to which they met the Danish vessel bound to Copenhagen. Captain M'Clntock, after touching at Disco, intends pseng through the Wargat Straits and calling at Proven and Upernavic for dogs. The Danesreport that the winter has been a very stormy one, which will have the effect of breaking the Ice up and rendering the head of Baffin's Bay clear. 3May I beg the favour that you will communicate to the public this prosperous commencement of a galLant under. taking, and oblige Younrs trnly, R.

MA. SPtrRGEOx.-A public meeting was helI in Now Park-street Chapel on Monday evening for the pur- eof promotinR the building of a large tabernacle for Sptrgeon. hIr. Spurgeon made a statement to the mbeetig of the success -which had attended the efforts of the ptomoters of the scheme, and the position In which matters at preeent stood. In doing so he alluded to the ser. vices held in the Surrey-hall in oonnexion with his congregation, which were got up with the view of obtaining funds for the enlargement of the building in which they were then aembled, and which were eminently suocessfuL Never &an had more cause to bles God than he ha' when ho look;ed back to the numbers which those services had been the mneans of winning over to the Gospel, and it wras also gratifying to see that, though derided and scouted by rmany at the time, the archbishops and bishops of the Church of England were now foUowing the example then set, and he hoped with equal sucoess. Ele wonld not pdin their feelons by alluding to the untoward circumstances attending thei first meeting at the Surrey Music-hll. It was a paintulpro. lude to a most magnificent result, and Stan never met with a greater failiure than he did in that attempt At coercion. Hdit notbcen for the lamentable accident which took puce on that occasion, so many thousands wonld have never been brought within the sound of the GospL That acddent wa the means of causing their meeting there to be known among the highest of the land; and, although ho considered it btt of little consequence, many of these had since attended their serTvios and heard the Gospel in its simplicity. Referring to the want of a large building, Mr. Spurgeon said some three montbs ago he had the honoux of breafasting with Sir S. IL Pet, who promised him 100l. dorAtioL When thihe foundation atone of such a building Was laId, Aau nother lOOt, ;bon it was fintshed, besides a Promrile of further -aiauae., He also told him tht he wold cause his tage t look out for a site suitable for the ertiosuc~aetrmn~p~ of whichx he wagto eopiniunlemte *lththe ;euiiuistee; but as be understoo4 SinM.

The Apostle Orson Pratt.then gave the "Sisters " some advice on the subject of marriage. He said that mariage if celebrated by the Mormon Church, which alone had ?l autkority, extended not only tlll death, but tWougoult eternity. He urged them not to marry men not Mormons, or else when they awoke in the Day of Judgment the' would lnd themselves without husbands, and be oblg to remain dngle througheut eternity. This he de.- sornbed to be a horrible eventuality, and propounded the doctrine that a propagation of spirits would go on in a fature world, just as the propagaion of our species goes on In this. Ezra Benson, another Apostle front the Salt IAke Valley addressed the audience in his shirt sleeves. his. speech ws full of Yankee humour, rather coarse, but it. toldwellwiththesaints.

He referredtotho subject of marriage, and to his eown wie and children-whom he had left in Utah, and said he believed that al his -wves 'would not apoetatie, and that therefore he-would not be likely to underLo the misery of remainig single In heaven.

Fronl -2 o'clock in the afternoon crowds 'f smen weere seen comini ,towards the Cestom- house from thoc entre of thetown, and, Ilest they inigtt be suspected of soncert in the matter, the3 filed off isn differeat directiots around the strtcture ir *question, and met each other gain on the quay. Uhis bodj of men, othoever they were, began to mix up with anothei party who were evidently residents in the vicinity of ths dook, and although there did not seem to be a harmony o: feelig-among them no breach ef the peace occurred. "Por a time the great oMhet of attraction was the Ca% torn-htouse atep?s, on whic,aboout 4l0 young men'hadtakes their sand; but rhos tby after'S o'clook p.m. a body of younl 'fellows, nuambering about 30, marched amnong the masses ii front of the Custom-house, and, pawingO on, mixed witl the crowd further duwas on the qumys, and 'which nltimatelJ con contrated before the Harbour-office, Queen's-quay. "The crowd increased in that directio, and about half .past 3 it amounted to several thousands. The borougi *constables were marched in r body to this point, and toob up a position in front of the auniorne ftiltworks-ffice From this time up till 4 o'clock the crowd increased anti 'the whole space, from the shed at CLarendon-dock to Vic toria-street, wes covered with human beings. The greal 'majority were respectable., and many womaen were present, "At 4 o'clock exactly the Rev. Hlugh Manna, carryingan aumbrella, walked down Corporation-street and into Queen. square, and, mixing anmong the crowd, gained the .platform .erected for his accoanmodation at the side of the Harbouroffice rails, without atracting attention. Once there he speedUy moanted the rostrum, and began to address his auditors, but was stopped by Mr. J. Clark, J.P., chaiman of the Harbour Commissioners, who, as we are informed, appealed to his good sense whether he considered it prudent to proceed. Mr. Hanna inquired if he prohibited him, adding at the same timse that he had a eonsti.tutional right to ;preach, which right he meant to exercise. Mr. Clark said he did not prohibit him; but, while admitting the right, said it might be expedient net t persist at preeent. Mr. William Coates, J.P. (it has been ast stated), then remnarked that he wvould hold Mr. Hanna responsible for any consequencem vhich might ensue, in replSv to which that gentlemnan said he was determined to vndicat the right of Protestants to preach the Gospel. " At the conclusion of this conversation the Rev. Hugh Hanna commenced the devotional services by givng cat a Psalm, which was sung, and praying. He then took for his text the words of St. Paul, in Hebrews, 1st chapter, 3d verse,-' How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?' The rev. gentleman proceeded to deliver a temperate evangelical address fromn these words, but he was notlong so engaged when a whistle was given in the crowd towards the Clarendon-dock, and a second in another part of the crowd, which bimediately divided, each parby taking its own tde. A voUey of stones came from the party next the dock, accompanied by a cheer, which was answered, and in less time than it takes us to narrate it the conflipting parties were fighting, Those nrext the docks gave way, pursued by men who, it afterwards sppeared, were Princpally hipwrights brandishing wooden bind eons used in their trade. The fighting portion of the mob, went up Donegall-quay, and in a short time afterwards about 40 young men and boys ran into the shipyards at the quay, from which they speedily returned with a further supply of the weapons already noticed. In the meantime their opponents were reinforced, and came towards the ecene of action, driving the stragglers beforethem in no very tender mode, when a conflict ensued, which ended in their retreat in &al directions. The treatment some men then recelved was dreadful. When the Catholic miob sought safety in flight, they were knocked dow in all directions, and brutally treated. One man especialy received such abuse that, if he survives, it may be said a man's skuU can resist anything. The bellgerents again 'went up the quay, but wers stopped about Gamble-street by the constabulary, under Sub-Inspector Bindon. The two parties were then separated, and woe to the unhappy man, whEether Protestant or Catholic, wFhose basiness or pleasure left him within the power of either mob. Msany mnaocert persons oE both sides, who knew nothing of the disturbance, have been the sufferers, and it will be wfell if loss of life does not result from the brutality of these mis- While all this was going forward the rev. gentleman 'was discoursing to a congregation of some 3,00 or 4,000 people withouzt molestation. At the conclusion of the aervice he said that he had been in communication with several respectable men of the industrioas classes, who 'were anxious that the right of their ministers to open-air preaching should be vindicated. He had eousented to viniLca&te that right, and he hoped they would submit to insult or injury rather than retaliate. The authorities were their le,lProtectors-the authorities of the town were quite aequate to maintain the peace; and he hoped they would now let all see tbat their conduct accorded with their profession as Christian men. HIe would ask them, therefore to retire to their own homes and not to be seen in the streets, lest they might render a tumult probable. He had Inaturely considered the matter, and was prepared to vindicate their rig ts. ie believed that that day would hxve a mighty influence. He made it manifest that he would unflinch. ingly maintain their rights; and he hoped they would ofuer no opposition to any one that would lead to a breach of the peace, but by their peaceable demeanour disarm a opposition, and leave to their enemies no opportunity of finding fault. IHe would maintain their rights, but it was possible for men, right-thinking men in other respects, so to act As to make their cause such as he could not defend, ard thus frustrate the objects be had In vaw. Mr. Hanna concluded by advising aU who heard him to go home peace. ably-an advice which was generally taken. "While this was going forward in one place the Riot Aot -bad been re-ad elsewhere, and the COnatabular-y, under the suPremne command of Mr. Hunt, resident magsrae and the miitary, inder the command f ol trate, appearoed upn thoe eene, anTd measures wereaken t cle thse streets. pat, desPito thir vigilamce, ti going on elewhere, tilu the rain set in.reav and,alot Inces ant showers drover the rufficns er coverf but, as an obnoxious Person Popaed a door or entry in wh eha were lo ated, theY rushed out and Pelted thi ore m erc lessly than the pitiles storm. pvlone.

"Baffled at the quayo, the mob retired, and, when at Donegall psace, a young mawn named Davison was brutally attacked, and beaten fromn the corner of Castle-place to Messrs. Lindsay's warehouse, inL which he sought refuge. One fellow held him by the necf, and beat the poor yo an on the head with a pamving stone. A gurgeon DJre=s his wound, but his life is in great danger.

The correspondent of Sa&htdeiS's Neusletter supplies a few additional narticniar,, - " Belfast, Sept. 7. " You have heard frorn the Belfast papers of this morn lng the result of the party riots yesterday in tho town, and you are niow prepared to hear what was done with the rloters at the police-court this morning. Butt before I tell you anything about the polioe business I may state to you that the feverish commotion among the people generally of this town, consequent upon the riota of yesterday, has not been equalled here for many years past. In the first place, aU classes of Protestants are justly indlgnant at the audacious conduct of a Popish mob in attempting to put a stop to Protestant ministers preaching in tho open air, and there is a strong feeling also manifested against the local magistrates for not affording the necessary legal protection to those ministers engaged in street preaching. The church of England clergymen, however, advised by Mnr. R. AC. Cairns, 'U.P., have resolved to abstain from street preaocing for the present, and they had nothing whatever to do with the proceedings of yesterday. The only gentleman who was preaching when the riot commenced was the Rev. Hugh Hanna, of Berry-street, and,thoughhewas alone yesterday hisbretiren of thePresbyterian ministry sympatize ewith him, and intend totakein their turn their part in open-air preachiDg in future. With regard to the proceedings of yesterday, I may tel you that a great many persons have been seriously injured during the riots that took place, not only in the day time, but also at n2ight. It is even said to-day that some personB have lost their lives, havlng been shot last night by the constabulary, 'who, in self-defence, were obliged to fire upon the Popish rioters in Barrack-street. It is certain that many are wounded, but when they fell they were carried away by their frlends, who now try to conceal aU knowledge of the faet. One person, namaed George Walker, who was talding no part in the riots, was shot in the left jaw, the ball passIng out at the back of his neck; he is now in a dangerous condition. Unhappily two of our magistrates, Mr. William Verner and Mr. Stevenson, were out oem the head and face by blows of stones from the Barrack-street mob last night, but they are not seriously hurt, as both gentle nen were on the bench to-day. "With these prelininary statements, I now proceed to give you a summary of this day's police- court. The magistrates on the bench were S. G. Getty, sq., Mayor; Charles EIunt, Esq., R.M. - W. J. . Allen, Esq, RobertThomson Esq., Thoias \rernor, Esq,, William Verner, Esq., Jon Clarke, Esq., and Robert Stevenson, "-The court was crowded to excess by the publ$c, and there was great interest taken it the proceedings. "There were nine prisoners in the dock, and they were all Roman Catholics. Their names were Bernard Gallagher, John Mullan, George Mann, Patriok M'Alster, George Shaokey, WdiamF Johncton, Thomas MIagann, James 'Iahoa, and Francis If atgee, They were all tried separately, and the charges were for boeng In a disorderly mob and throwing stones. They were all convicted, with the axception of George Mann, and he was ordered to be discharged, as the evidence was not strong enough against bin. "The 3Mayor delivered judgment. Se said the magls- trates were unanimous in their decision, as they believed theI prisoners had takon part in riotous proceedings calculated to disturb the peace of the town. The authorities were determined to put an end to snch proceedings if possible; and though it happened that all the prisoners belonged to oue class in the community the magistrates were determiined to know no party, and all persons brought forward as Implicated in party riots would be dealt with in the severest manner. The prisoners, therefore, must pay a fine of 40e 1 and ctohsts eac, or in default be committed to gaol for two "Immnediately after the above cases were dis,posed of, ":Mr. James h'iLean, solicitor, said he VwVa instreted toi state that a great many persons who had uothing whatever to do with the mobs yesterday were beaten severely in dif- .erent parts of the town. One young man who was in thei employment of the iesrsm. Lindsay, of Donegall-pl%ue, wasI proceeding with his Bible and Prayer-book in hand to the Sabbath-school, when he was assaulted and violently beaten by the mob in Donegall-place. The Messrs. Lindsay instructed him to say that they would give lOOI. as a reward to any person whocould identify the parties who committed the outrage upon the young man. He might also say that away by the mob, and had noot sihnce been wicoered.Me "* Mr. H unt, R., said all that the magistratea could do in the mcatter would be to issue summonses if the parties who committed the oflence could be found."

He was lnot afterwards seen alive. On the following day (Thursday) about 5 o'clock, William Adams, who is 21 years of age, also left home, as is alleged, shortly after having had An alteration with his father.

The evidence which has been already detailed went to show clearly that the wouna was inffictea by the prlsoner, and it was further corroborated by the deeeased, who made a statement to a similar effect, shortly before he died, at the University College Hospital. Mr. Handley, from the office of Mdr. Muedy, as on the former occasion, attended for the prisoner. The follo wing additional evidence was taken Thomas Shadgouch, aged 18, residing at 8, Denton-street, sald that he saw the prisoner and the deceased in the street.

He also produced the stick which was in the possesion of the deceased when he was stabbed. MIr. BROUGHT2ON said it was a most serious charge for a man to draw a knife and stab another, and that he would commnxit him on the ch-ae of wilful mnrder. Mr. Haudley observed that he should reserve his (the prisoner's) defence. The prisoner was then fully committed for trial, and the witnesses were hound o ver toi prosecute.

The airst part of the case occurred on Tuesday week, when a well-built, good-looking yoDng fellow, named Reuben CoID8s, was charged on suspicion of being a deserter. The charge almost solely rested on the evidence of a dirty-looking man named Elias Benjamins, describing himself as a dealer in Houndsditci, And wbo, giving his evidence with the greatest apparent trutbfulness, said that while passing through Whitechapel on the preceding day he saw Collins, who bad then pn military clothing, talking to a loose woman, who induced him to go into a heershop ;thth,spein sometbing wronLg, foilowed them into thezhue weebete saw the soldier engaged with te about buying his clothes, which apparently ended in an agreeament to that effect, as theyathe came out together, and adjoun=ed tarvto house next door; and that after Watching tbere some time, the three men left, the soldler dresses in the clothes he now worse while each of the Jews had a bundlle. The witness charged Colln withx being a deserter, which he dentied ;but he gave him into custody notwithstanding. On heuaing this ce Collins at ozce acknowledged that he beloniged to thRoa Artillery, but that, as his company was under orders for India, and he bad a wife whom he did not like to leave behind bhim, he had absconded from Woolwioh garrison that nornkg,n,asdmadehis way up to town in thelhopeof escAping. With this confession the m1agistrate sent the soldier to the House of Detention, that he might be given Up for punish ment to the military authorities, and, having as eased regrt that the people who had purchased the medal and clothing could niot be found, Beujana at once said he knew them and would endeavour to find them. On Saturday Phillips was brought up, charged with beine one of the men who hd purchased the accoutrements, aIn Benlamiirn repexted the e"idence he had given in the previous case against Collins. Phillips earnestly protested that he knew nothing 'whatever of any such transaction and declared that Benjamins was a convicted thief; this the latter denied, and, there appearing 'no reason to doubt his testimony, Phillips was convicted under the 18th of Victoria, cap. 11, and sen'enced to pay a penalty of 51, or undergo a month's imprisonment in the House of Correction in defauit, and, aa he could not pay the penalty, he was committed. Yesterday the third defendant, Samuels, was brought up at the instance of Benjamins, charged with complicitytin the oahar aen's misconduct, when Benjamins deposed to the above particulars in the same cleAr and coninected mannet as he had done bef ore. This prisoner said, " I really am accused innocently. Sir; I ma nothlng whatever about it;" and three or four per son& in coutt simultaneously called out that they kneow im sO well to he a respectable man that they would willingly be come bail for him. ' . Mr. (seen, a lced isedvlctuer at' Whitechapel, here stood forward, and expressed such anxiety to be examined against the testimony of Benjamins that the m agi'sAe ordered him to be sworn, and hMr. Green thenAd.Uafn Mon day week the witness Benjamins, whom he X"lito be a bad character, while Samuels he as well knew to be an honest man, brought the Artilleryman to his house, and sked him if they could be accommodated with a Private room, as the soldier had left the army and wished to ex: change his uniform for a suit of Private clothes; but he felt so satisfied therea was something improper between them thast he without hesitation refused them the room and or. E.ted them out Of the houe. He heard no more of the matter till the previous night, when he heard that Phillips had been committed upon the evidence of BeDjamlus for purchasing the very clothes Benjwmins had brought the soldier to bis house in, and on coming to this court and finding Samuels also under examination on the same charge be felt It would bewvrong for himato conceal what he nlew of the witness's conduct. Benjamins declared that he owa not in Mr. Green's ; remises, as hehad stated, but hlr. Green adhered decisively to his evidence, and MIr. DEYsNCoUrT said that after Mr. Green's statement the case had assamed such a very differeut appwaranoe that be should order Benjamins to be detained in custody, and in the meantime inquiries must be made by the polce, and every witness adduced whose evidence was necessary to a thorough and earching investigation of the whole matter. Bnjamins expressed gret astonishment at finding him¢-I self in custody, and protested that all he had stated was! nothing bute thetruth; btbCe was removed in the midst of1 his asseveratloDn by the gaoles, apd afterwards transferred to| Se ySTAL P ArACE.-ON SHILLUnG DAY, Tuesday, Sept.. 8 .-AdmiWons on payment, ,248; by season ticket4, 181; to4i y Yidtps, 4,429,
