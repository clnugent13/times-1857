EPIDEMIC CHOLBRA. The following precautionary advice to local boards of health with reference to epidemic cholera has been issued by the General Board of Health, Whitehall:- " General Board of Health, Whitehall, Sept. 29. "Cholera has again become epidemic in several of the Baltic ports, and at Eamburg. On each of the three former occasions, wheu the disease has visited England, its first appearance in our eastern seaports foDowed closely on its epidernic outbreak in the last-named city. " During the past three months there has beexxobserved ina London, and in some other parts of England, a very uausual fatality from diarrhoa; and this derangement of the public health is such as, on the previous occasions referred to. preceded the commencemeat of the epidemic periods of cholera. " The General Board of Health deems it expedient to call the attention of local boards of health to these facts, and moat earnestly recommends that the power vested in sach boards for the protection of the public health be exercised from the present time with especial vigilance. II As regards the exercise of these powers with particular reference to the prevention of cholera, the most important security for the public health is to be found in the fulfilment of two conditions :-First, that the air within and about dwelling-places be not contaminated with offensive organic effluvia, such as arise when the houses themselves are ill ventilated, overcrowded, and unclean, or when their refuse is not properly removed from them by drainage or otherwnse, or when any filthy accumulations exist in their neighbou:hood, or vwhen the local sewerage is defective. Secondly, that the public supply of water he, as far as possible, unpolnuted by any kind of animal or vegetable inpurty, for where cholera is present or impending no house can he considered safe for habitation in which there is any offensire smell of animal refuse, or of other putrefactive anim;al or vegetable matter; and no water can he considered safe fer drinking into which there Slows (as is often the case with rivers and with wells in the neighbourhood of houses) any habitual discharge of town refuse or any accidental soakage or leakage from drains or cesspools "An abstract is subjoined (see below) of those more important provisions of the Pablic Health Act, the Nuisance Removal Act, and the Common Lodgieghouses Acts, under which local boards of hoalth are able to provide for the sanitary improvement of their respective districts in the various matters referred to. " In proceeding to the exercise of these. powers at the present juncture, it is desirable that early and special attention should be given to those parts of each district which have hitherto been unhealthiest, particularly to those where cholera has prevailed on previous occasions, or where diarrhosa has been most frequent; also, that thelocal board should be kept woll informed as to the amount of bowel complaint prevailing from time to time within their district, and that intelligence should be given to the General Board in casa of any notable increase in the prevalence of such disorder. " It is to be expected that the officer of health (where one has been appointed) will inquire with more than ordinary minuteness into the state of premises, and into the quality of the different sources of water-supply, within his district; and that sanitary inspectors and mspectors of nuisances will use the utmost vigilance In every department of their duty-especially in reference to public eeavengin-, to the state of sewers, to the removal of house-refuse, to tie keeping of slaughterhouses and cattle sheds, and to the fulfilment ofsuch orders for sanitary work as the local board mnay find it requisite to issue. *Two cases-furnished by the experience of the last epidemic-peculiarly deserve the consideration of local boards, as iliustrating what may reasonably he expected from sanitary improvement in averting the ravages of cholera. " 1. In September 1853, the most devastating outbreak of cholera experiencedyet in England occurred at Nvcastweupon-Tyne, which is near to Tynemouth, and connected with it by arailway. In Newcastle and Gateahead, within a few weeks, nearly 2,000 people died of the disease; and the cost (direct and indirect) of this visitation was estimated ataboat 40,0001., over and above the large losses sustained from the temporary stoppage of trade. In the neighbouring borough of Tynemoutl, during the same epidemic period, only 12 deaths from cholera occurred, of which but four were indigenous cases; and yet diarrheaa was generaUy prevalent at Tynemouth, while cholera prevailed at Newcastle and the adjoining town of Gateshead. Many thouand persons from the latter towns fled to Tynemouth, and many continued to pass daily between the two towns during the whole time of the vitation. This comparative immunity of Tynemouth is the more remarkable from its contrast with the heavy mortality experienced during the outbreak of 14S-9, for on that oocasion the deaths in the parish from cholera and diarrho3a amounted to 463, and the contingent expenses for the maintenance of widows and orphans due to that four months' visitation appear to have amounted within the next four years to 7,001. " The great difference between these results seems to have been entirely due to sanitary improvements effected in Tynemouth during the interval between the two visitations. Dr. Greenhow (who at that time was chairman of the local board, and took an active part in promoting its sanitary measures) has written the following eccount* of the course which was adopted:-' The Public lHealth Act was applied to the borough of Tynemouth, on the petition of the town-council, in the summer of 1851. The provisions of the Act relative to the registration and regulation of common lodginghouses and slaughterhouses and the construction of new streets and houses were imnmediately put in force. Care was taken to prevent the erection of houses without proper conveniences, and provision made for ventilation. rNo ashpits were allowed to be made against the main wals of dwelinghouses or without proper doors and covers. Wherever se wers existed drains from the houses were insisted on, and all persons laying out new streets were compelled to have ack entrances to the houses, and to provide for the construction of drains from the backs of the houses, Instead of carrying them underneath the basement story, as was previosly usuaL In the auatmn of 1852, when the reappearane of cholera in this country was considered probable, an active inspection of the town was instituted by the Public Health Act Committee; the bycourts and lanes were thoroughly cleansed; the gully grates trapped; the foul open ditch behind the North-street was cleansed and filled in; and many other local nuisances throughout the borough were removed. On the report of the first death from cholera in Newcastle, in 1853, the like measures were again resorted to. The courts, lanes, and common lodginghouses were inspected by the health committee, aided by other members of the town-council. Every common lodginghouse in the town was peremptorily ordered to be lime-washed and cleansed within 48 hours, an order which was strictly obeyed. A large staf of carts and men were at once employed to cleanse aU the courts, lanes, and back passages in the town, which, after the rough dirt was removed, were sluiced with water thrown into them by a powerful fire-engine afloat on the river. All the courts and smaller streets, after being thus perfectly cleansed, were lime-washed. Dep,ots of quicklime for the use ofthe poor were placed in convenient places throughout the borough, at the expense of the Board of Health, and to induce them to make free use of it the local authorities personally visited the inhabitants of the localities in which cholera had formerly prevailed. Ruinous channelswere repaired,and wherethe gullies wereimperfeetly trapped this was rectified, and chloride of lime, of which a ton was speedily consumed, was profusely used for the purpose of disinfecting them. In the course of 14 days the town was brought into as good a sanitary state as possible under exsting circumstances, 1,500 cartloads of {manure having been removed in that short period from the viciaity of human habitations. The entire expense incurred by these operations amounted to 2301., which was afterwardl reduced to less than 2001. by the sale of the manure.' "S8econdly the onthern districts of London (comprising nearly afit of the entire population of the metropois) have presented a complete proof of the importance of a pure water supply in relalion to the ravages of cholara For throughout those districts, during the epidemic of lS.53-4, there were distributed two different qualities of water, so that one large population was drinking a tolerably good water, another larze population an exceedinglyfoul water; while in all other respects these two populations (being intermixed in the same districts, and even in the same streets of these districts) were living under precisely similar social and sanitary circumstances. And when, at the end of the epidemic period, the death rates of these populations were compared it was foand that the cholera mortality in the houses supplied by the bad water had been 3A times as great as in the houses suxpplied by th: better water. This proof of the fatal influence of foul water was rendered still stronger by reference to what had occurred in the epidemic of 1848-9; for on that occasion, one of these companies (which soon afterwards improved its supply) was giving even a worse water than its rival - and the population supplied by it had at that time suffereL a proportionate cholera mortality. So that the consequence of the improvement mado by this water company in the interval between the two epidemics was, that whereas in the epidemic of 18-18-9 there had died 1.E25 of their tenants, there died in the epidemic of 1S53-4 only 611; while among the tenants of the rival company (whose supply between the two epidemics had become worse instead of better) the deaths, which in 1848-9 were 2,880, had in 1853-4 increased to 3,476 t And when these numbers are made proportionate to the popalations or tenantries concerned in the two periods respectively, it is found that the cholera death-rates per 10,000 tenants of the companies were about as loUows:-Foor those who in 1848-'3 drank the worse water, 125; for their neighbours, who in the same epidemic drank a water somewhat less impure, 118, for those who in 1853-4 drank the worst water which had been supplied, 130; for those who in this epidemic drank a comparatively clean water, 37. The quality of water which (as is illustrated in the first three of these numbers) has produced such fatal results in the metropolis-causing two-thirds of the cholera-,deaths in those parts of London which have most severely suffered from the diseaso-has been river water polluted by town-drainage; but in other instances there is reason to believe that some of the most destructive outbreaks of cholera which have occurred in particular groups of houses have depended on the use of well-water into which impurities had either been carelessly thrown, or had drained or leaked through the adjoining soil. " The General Board of Health would earnestly direct tho attention of local boards to these'. cases. They (with many similar facts) support the conclusion' which, at the close of the last epidemic, was adopted by the Medical Council of the General Board, to express the present stato of scientific knowledge as to the causes of cholera:-'The doctrine of epidemic cholera which has gained almost universal acceptance does not affect to explain what may be that power-the exciting cause of the epidemic manifestation, which at intervals of time has forayed from place to place about our globe, sometimes vaguely spreadlag over a wvidened area, sometimes seeming to move in more defined prosession, and which now for the third time has shed its fatal insluence on our land, But, with this mystery still unsolved, there has grown more and more into shape a doctrine wvich is both intelligible and practical,-that the undiscovered poveer, in its wanderings, acts after the manner ICObolera in 1,nc6month In 1831-,2, 1848-49. and I853.

" It is possible that no human efforts may suffice to avert the course of that apidemic ferment which thus, at certain Intervals of time, comes, as it were, to test the sufficiency of our sanitary defances. Bat public authoxities, arrned vith the existing Po wers of the law, can do almost everything to render the mysterious influenee innocuous by removing those local eosiditions through which alone it is enabled to destroy life In this climate. " Local boards may be well assured that, if any precautions adopted by them against cholera should hereafter seem to have been superfluous in relation to that epidemic -if the suggested possibility of a fourth visitation should happily not now b re ed-the pains and cost which may have been given to sanitary improvement will in no degree have been wasted; since undoubtedly such exertions -vili have borne fruit in preventing other disease, and in essening both the miisery and the expense, the waste of life and the waste of money, which are now the consequence of defective sanitary arrangements.

TO THE BDITOB OF THE TZJfES. Sir,-I should eondder It a great favour if you would allow this short letter to appear in the colun=s of yoar newspaper. Undor ordinary eireumstances I should not have veatured to make such a request. In your paper of October 2 there was an extract from an Indian paper called the Overland fail, and therein were mentioned the casualties which recently had taken place in the army before Delhi. Among the Dames of the oflicers to whom somre casualty had happened was one in whom I a n deeply interested-Philip Sydney Yorke. From the man ner m which this name was nuentioned all yonr roader, must have supposed that he has been killed. This, I a n thankful to say, is not the case. By the last mail I bear i from him that he was obliged to procure viok leave of abeence, and go to the hills for his health; and this, there fore, is the easualty alluded to.

WESTmT.STE:r HOsPrrAL.-The wrinter session of the Westminster Hospital School of Medicine was opened on Thursday last, the 1st of October, with an inaugural address by Dr. Radcliffe, and after the lecture a crowded conversazione was held in the board-room of the hospital, and the prizes were distributed to the students who hzd be'n successful in the previous winter and summer sessions. In the address Dr. Radoliffe spoke of the present state of science, and of the medical science in particular, as one in which there was too much simple obser;ation and too little thinking upon the things observed, and he urged the iecssity of studying with a view to the discovery of principle and law, and at the same tinie he endeavoured to show that there were even now sullicient reasons for believing in the existence of a general principle by which vital and physical phenomena were alie governed.

HANTS AND ;FrLT3S EDUCATIONAL SOCIETY. BASINGSTOKE, MONDA Y. The annual conference of this sooiety was held in the Town-hall this day, and it was attended by a large number of the clergy of the two counties. The Very Rev. the Dean of Salisbury occupied the ohair, anca there were seated near him the Lord Bishop of Salisbury, the Earl of Carnarvon, PLev. Cauon Woodroffe, of Vinchester. Sir Edward Hulse, Bart., Mr. G. Sclater, LP., Mr. W. W. Beach, M.P.. HIon. and Rev. S. Best, Ir. W. L. Selater, Mr. Chute, Rev. S. Chermside, Dr. Booth (of the Society of Arts in London), }lev. J. Temple, inspeotor of schools, &c. The Dean of SALiSBURY said,-I cannot occupy this seat without expressing my deep sense of the honour you have done rne by asking me to take the obair on this occasion. In opening the business of the day I fee: that it will be my first duty to congratulate the fotud,rs of this association upon the success which it his alr' a ly attained-a success 'which we aU know is mainli due to the sound principles on which it is based, and to the abdity, zeal, and energy with which itsoperatfons have been conducted. Its object, I believe yon all know, is to promote the mental improve. ment of the adolpscent and adult classes in the two counties of Hants and Wiltg, This assocition was, I believe, the very first in England to attempt to introduce anything like literary institutions among the rural part of the population. But the establishment of this, I may call very valuable soeiety, is not the only service whioh Hampshire has rendered to education. It was in a small obscure village of this county that we have the earliest specimen, and it may be well called the first model, of a thoroughly efficient parochial education. (Hear, hear.) By elevating what tMi then was a very low standerd of education, and by making the system of educatlonuseful and practical, parents were taught to set a value on the education of their children. The prejudices of the farmers-a class most strongly opposed to She ineruction of the labourer-rwere gradually overcome, and they soon saw it was to their interest that their children should be educated ia common with the children of the labournng classes. The school after a time became selfsupporting, and was the means of effecting a great moral, socala, and spiritual revolution in the midst of a once dis. orderlyparish. (Hear, hear.) This meeting need not he told howv beneficial an influence the Dean of HTereford exercised, and I rejoice to say continues to exercise, on the progress of the education of the people. (Hear, hear.) I may he allowed to mention another circumstance which redounds to the honour of Eampshire as an educational county. It appars from the financial statement published in the recent volume of the minutes, that thls society has derived from Parliamentary grants no less a saun than 49,000.-n sum lrger in proportion to the population than any other county ,n England. These, then, are very grest services which this county has rendered to the cause of education. But in offering what I feel to be a ist tribute to this educational county I may be allowed to claim for the county of Wilts the honoar of having been a wvorthy associhte in the same sacred cause, In proof of wrhich I may allude to many excellent schools which have 'ceen established in Wiltshire, and more especially to the admirable training school in Salisbury for schoolmuistresses, which is among the most flourishing and best-con. ducted estabishments in the kingdom. To promote tho educational object for which we have met we have bat to supply the deficiency of early tending, and, if possible, to enlarge the scanty stores of knowledge that may have been acquired at schooL This, of course, will bo very much fad. hitated by the improvement and extension of elementary education, because I need hardly say that a day school ought to be a preparation for the night school, and the class in literary and mechanics' institutes. To make the day school, therefore, what it ought to be, and what I believe It is capable of being made, is directly conducive to the ob-ect we have in view-namely, the successful working of an association like this. Mow, there is among the promoters of education an unanimity of sentiment on one polnt,-that we ought not to go on wasting valuable time in fruitless discussion, but we ought rather vigorously to Eet to work to grapple with the substantial difficulties that interfere with education, whatever parties or denominations we may belong to. (Eoar, hear.)) 'he great object we ought to have in view should be the improvement of elementary education. (Hear, hear.) Now, I think the object we ought to have in view should be to adapt the day school to the circumstances and condition of the people. We ought, in the first place, to introduce a practical and useful system of instraction. and one which bears directly on the trading and agricultural pursuits of thelocality; andthen we ought to introduce as much as possible the combination of industrial work, yielding wages, in connexion vwith school teaching. Now, It wiiU never do to shut up within the walls of the schoolroom all the day long a boy who has to get his bread by the sweat of his brow. Re ought to be accustomed to give a portion of his time to manual employment; he ought to be early inured to hard work out of doors, and to the vicissitudes of the weather. It therefore should be our object to induce the employers of labour and parents to concar in some plan by which school teaching shall be combined mith industrial employment out of doors. How to effect this is, of course, a subject of very great difficulty. At the recent meeting of the Educational Conference of London the chief subject of discussion was how to remove that great difficulty in the way of the plan of elementary educationthe short and Irregular attendance of children at schooL In the first place it was necessary to ascertain clearly the cause of this short and desultory attendance. It was generally admitted that that cause was to be ascribed to the indifference and immorality of parents, but chiefly to their necessities and the demand for juvenile labour. Now, in the present condition of the labouring clssses, withlow wages and high prices, we can hardly wonder -rather I would say it is no matter of wonderthat the labouning man should remove his child from school as soon as he is able to earn a trifle, or 2s. or 3s. per week, for his work. Mr. Cook, in his very in. telHgent book on labour, says a boy may earn from 3s. to is. a-week in London and the manufacturing districts, but in agricultural parts from 2s. to 3s. a-week. Now, to ask a parent to keep his children at school beyond tho age they are now allowed, and when by their work he would make an addition of about one-fourth to his own earnings, is something like asking a parent to pay so much for his children's education. Now, let us be just to a poor, hard-working man, aud ask whether there are any persons in the middle or higher classes of society who would like to pay so large a portion of their income to educatl in ? We must therefore adapt our system of instruction to the circumstances of the poor. But, in fact, we are, I fear too apt to use an unreal and lofty language In talking to the poor about the blessings of education. Beyond all doubt we cannot insist too strongly upon education exerting a loft;F influence, and that it is of immense importance to tram up the young early in habits of morality and religion. But the working man requires something more than that. He requires that the instruction to be given to his child should be that which would bear on his future calling-that it should, in fact, be productive of solid and tangible advantage. To recur to the upper classes for one moment, we shall find that the children are educated with special reference to their future professions or positions in life; why, therefore. should not the poor man, in like manner, desire his child to be fitted to pursue his humble caUing? The union of school teaching with industrial employment has been carried out most successfully, as we all k-now, in parts of London and the manufacturing districts, especially in cotton factories, by what is called the half-time system, where children from eight to 13 years of age are required to be at school, not half of the whole of the day, but half of the time required for work-namely, they are required to be at work six hours and they are required to be at scbool at least three hours per day for five days a-week. In theory the system appears to be perfect, but the law Is defective. The law prescribes attendance at school, but it has tak-en no pains to ascertain or insist upon an efficient system of education or of teachers. Any failure, therefore, in the half-time system, is attributable to the law, and not to the svstem itself. Where the employers of labour have been and are still earnest in urging forward the education of children the system has been successfuL The question is, can this system be applied generally ? To determine this point we have a simple test. It is es%antialtothe successful working of a half-time systemthatit shonldbe subjected toconstautand vigilant supervision. Where such supernisionis practicable, as where a large number of children are congregated together suited to regular employment, the half-time system may be introduced. It cannot be introduced where there is not. i state this onthehigh authorityof oneoEHer Majesty's inspectors of factories, Mr. Horner, whose extensive experience, sound judgment, and zeal in education, entitle his opinion on that subject to the areatest weight. Though the system is not capable, perhaps, of being carried out as well as many might desire, we have abundant experience to show that this may be most successfully employed; that principle being, as I have already alluded to, a combination of select teaching to a greater or less extent with industrial employment yielding wages. There are many instances of its successful operation in large towns, but I may be permitted to mention two cases only. The first is that of Price's Patent Candle Company, and the other that of Messrs. Spottiswoode and Eyre, printers to the Queen. With regard to the latter establishment, there is a remarkable corroboration of what I have said of the imtnense advantage of having education combined with regular work. In that estabhshment there are four classes of lads employed-all of whom, to the readers from 13 to 15 years of age, are required to supply the places of anprentices -the highest order of Iads employed. The readers are empsoyc iom ~ O'loc in the day,bTtheyeare'olgdt PIO.Yed from J o'clock in the day, -but thbe-y a~re o"b e'd-to attend school from S to 9 o'clock in the morning five days in the week. The present Bishop of London, who at the beginning of the year examined these lads, exprORSed Lot oly his satisfaction but his astonishment at their proficienrcy under such circumstances. (Applause.) It becomes an exceedingly interesting question how far any modification of the factory system, or the half-time system as it is called, can be applied to the agricultural districta. The system of alternate days for work and school has been strongly recommended, and we have ihb rosult of an experiment tried by Mr. Paget, the member for Nottingham, who has carried out this plan with admirable success; but this may have been uneer exceedingly favourable circumstances, and we must not from this rashly deduce any positive oonclusioDs. (Hear, hear.) We bear it constantly alleged that the movement of the halftime system will be opposed by farmers. No doubt they wil, until they see tho practical benefit of it. Once satisfy the farmer of the superiority of educated over unedtcated labourers, and we shall have aU opposition cease, as the opposition did cease in the remarkable instane of the parish of King's Sombre. We all know the opposition the former excellent vicar-the D oen of Hereford-reeeived fromn the farmers, but when they saw the success of it their prejudices died away, nud they became his heartiest sup. porters. (Applause.) I ought to mention a circumstance highly honourable to the farmers of that parsh, and which deserves to be generally known About two years ago there occurred a deficienoy in the school fund. The farmers actually voluntarily assessed themselves to the extent of 6d. in the pound to meet that deficiency. (Eear, hear.) That was the fruit of the seed, long ago sown, and I think we must all sympathize with the delight the Dean of Hereford must have realized in WitneSSing such successful resalts of hisLabonrs, (Applause.) Before Sitting down I must ad. ve b Heflyro thne brightenihg prespectswe now happily have of national education (hear), of national education in its widest sense, comprehending the education not alone gf the laboung classes, the vagrants, and the paupeN, bnt of the hlgher classes, the mercantile, nd others. (}ear, hear.) How mauch need there is of some improvement in the rudl. mental Instruction of the middle cLasses has been plaia2lyr evinced by the significant faot sorne tie ago made knowrt the public-namely, that out of 680 persons nominatd io public officeg on the Civil Servioe Commission no less than 425 were rejected for bad spelling, and 147 from ignorance of the simple rules of aithmetic. (Hear, hear.) This system of examination into the qualification of penons for publio (offices, although carried out but imperfectly at pre. sent, has already produced very important resultR. (Hear.), Parents in the middle and upper classes of society are nowmore anxious to give a superior education to their children - teachers in all ranks are stimulated to greater exertion; thef youths are incited to greater steadiness and industry, now that they know that upon their own exertions must depemd their own advanceir ont in lifo. Only apply this principle in its full extent-only let grpat public oompmaies anI employers of labour insist on a certain amount of educea tion as a condition of employment, and we shall have accomplished as much as we can expect to do in the matter of education in a free country like this. By such gettle such judicious pressure, we shall apply the only mode ;E compulsion which England is ever likely to submit to in pro. moting the education of thepeople. Withregard, however, to the middle class education, It has received recently an in. mense impulEe by the proposal to hold periodical examins. tions of ponons at proprietary and large schools, and to erras certifcates to those who have atained a certain Amount of proficiency. The principle of testing by examination, aas thereby improving the middle-clas education, was flirst ape plied by the Society of Arts in the case of pupils edu. cated at mechanics' institutes, and subsequentl adopted X particular, though the strenuous exertions of Zr.Ack1andw by the Aoricultural Society of the West of England, and t is now going to be carried out, we shall all be most happy to hear, by Oxford and Cambridge. (Applause.) It is im. possible to overrate such a movenent on the p art of nar ex. cellent universities. By thus nobly and boldly taldng thes lead in meeting the new requirements of the times, ther will add immeasurably to their influenoe and usefulner and will gradually become again what ther originaIly were, thorough national places of educaton. (Applause.) But, am, our present purpose is more wth adolescent and adult education generally, I will not trspass further on you! indulgence. (Loud cheers.) The report of the cornmittee wa read, after which sever,* subjects were introduoed for dis cussion. One which engaged the larger portion of the time of the conferenoe w&-- -" Can the evening school or the half-time sstem in the day.school, combined with the Sunday-school, be rendered a sufficient substitute for the more regular teaching of theday-school, and under what conditions?' Sever3lclergy. men addressed the conferenoe, and some speakers expresael a confident belief that even in ruial districtg the hlf-time system might be advantageously adopted, though there were others iWho maintained that there were almost insuper-. able objections to it. The Earl of CARS ARVO sdil the question under discus. don was the practicability of the half-time system. It was a question-though he was not present himself-that was discussed with very great interest, and with a good deal I keenness on both sides, at their lAst conference, and on that; subject he ventured to offer theobservations he was about to snake rith very great reluctnce, because he believed from those opinions the hon. and rev, chairman some. what differed. He was quite sure of this, that all of thema who had in any way considered the question would only look at it in the light of what was feaible. If it wasfeasible they were all prepared to go along with ther measure and assist it to the utmost. (Applause&) If it was racticahle, he would go so far as to say that then it would e eminently conducive to the ben efit of both the employer and theoboy himself. (Hear,hear.) Hiebeleved, if the boy wasat school three days and at wotk three days, that then ho would do as much work in the three days as he did formerly In the six. But then came the question, could itbe appll. to rural districts? The general argument that he hsdlmeard used had always been one referring to the operation of the Factory Act. He did not believe that that Act would apply and work in the rural districts, and for one or two reasors. In the first place, the half-time system started with thesupposition of a superfluity of labour. Now, in Ilampshire-to speak of their own county-there was really no superfluous labour whatever. (Hear, hear.) He h4iled this fact with satisfaction, inasmuch sa he hoped it might be taken as an index of tho sound prosperity of the county. (Applause.) Then, inthe next plaoe, ft must be remembered that In the great towns the employed. clustered round the employers' factory at tba distance of *. few hundred yards, so that there was not much difficulty im. getting them together,while in the country they had exactly the reverse. Many agricultural labourers lived at great distances from their work. Some, from his own personal observation, he knew came every morning five or six miles to their labour; or they had them, asi is the custom, hired at the farms and continually residing with the farmer, which. wouldinvolve, of course, not only a double supplyof workmen, but a double supply of accommodation for them. Again, they must remember that in manufacturing towns the employerswere generally men of large means, and though inthe country there were men of capital and substance, stil the majority of those upon whom they would have to try their system were men comparatively of small means, and who could. hardly be called upon to make an eXPeriment of the system.. (Hfear, hear.) It had been said that the farmers wouldE readilys acquiesce in each a scheme, tleoae they wnulI he fully alive to the importance of having a choice of skiUed and unskilled labour. He believed the farmuer would gladly employ skilled labour in preference to unskiUed. Last year there was a declaration read from some agriculturist;, wherein they promised they would give a value to the certificates of the Hants and Wilts Educational Society. But, on the other hand, boys who more immeditely came under the influence of that society, after 9, 10 and up to 13 or 14 years of age, were not skUlded labourers therefore the areu mentseemedtofailinthatcase. TheFactoryA appliedto children under 13 years of age. The half-time system would apply to boys from 12 to 15. The Factory Act had a double object in view. It proposed primarily and mainly to prevent; any over-working of children themselves at A very early ageand, secondsrily, to enforce an attendaLce upon Fcto l- But the whole object of those who prop3ced the half-time system was not to prevent oner-working of chlldren, but to compel them to attend a certain number of hours in school. Now it had never been said that there had been any ph.ical hardship in agricultural employment. (Hear, hoar.) Thez were bound to remember what the position of the agriculturaL labourer was. He started from no very high intelletual level, and just at the time when he thought he had done with the main expense of his child, they pro. posed he should pay for additional schooling, and also forego the labour of his chlldjust at the time when he was looking to be repaid. In fact, the plan seemed to bring into coUision two very important principles-first, the principle of a love of knowledge; and, secondly, the principle of marketable labour. And, much as one would wish it to be the reverse, when they put these two princinles to. gether, their strength was so dispro ortionate, that, li-e the old fable, the earthen pot, when dashed against the irort pot, would be the first that went to the wall. At the same ! time he did not deny that there was a difficulty in the case ' ithat there was a considerable grievance, if he might so cALf iit, on the part of labourers' children to be remedied. It I was shown that between 5,000 and 6,000 children, who were mere infants, were employed in agricultural opera, tions, and some hundreds of thousands below 15. Also, it was shown that not above one-half of those who coul f attend school did so, and of that a half or a majority of tha; half left school before 11,and almost all had left it before 1l i years of aye He believed the real remedy, as far as remedy I could be round for this evil, lay in a succession of small I successes, such as night schools, book-hawking soeietie>, attention of the clergy, Ac. It these plans were well carried out, ke believed they would have proceeded a very considerable way in solving the difficulty, which he admitted ta be a very great and a very pressing one. (Applause.) Other members addressed the conference, after which a, large party dined together at the Angel HoteL In the evening the Earl of Carnarvon delivered a lecture at tle Institution on the "Later History of the County c. lants."
TO THE EDITOR OF THB TIFEX& Sir,-Being late last night at Seskar, an island about 41 miles below Cronstadt, in the (Glf of Finland, I undertook. at the request of a shipwrecked mariner (the owner of the ship Nile, 3,S tons register, Stephens master), to commnnit cate to you, and request you to be so good as to pablish the fact, that the said ship, from Hartlepool to Cronstadt, with a cargo of coal, was stranded on the north-west reef oE the island of Seskat during a very heavy gale, on the morning of Tuesday, the 2$d of September, at .' SO am., and will become a total wreck. The vessel is on her beam ends and cargo gone crew saved, the whole of the crew having experienced the greatest kindness from the inhabitants. I know not whether the following news umay hate reacli-d you or not, but on the same mnorning, about S o'clock, tho Leffort, a large SO-gun Russian ship, with two other smaller Russian men-of-war, on their w;ay from Revelto Cronstadt, were, when off iogland, caught in the same storm. The effort was, though under the smallest sail, seen to heel orer soddenly, then right herself, and in less than 1(I minutes went down wn deep wator with Sl, souls on board, being 750men,50ome and 17 childn. Not one wa saved or even seen. Those vessels were bringing a numbet of Russian families from Revel to Cronstadt for the winter. About 50 families are supposed to have been on boad. The other two vessels arrived safely on Friday last. The churches of Cronstadt had offices for the dead performe t. which were attended by the Grand Duke and the authorities of the port. I have tho honour to b, Sir, your obedient servan*. A N ENGLISHMASN. St. Petersburg, 15.27 Sept.
THE LATE BRITISH M rINISTRE AT L1uvA.-This; unfortunate gentleman, whose atrocious murder by son* unknow n assassin is confirmed by the last mail from Pern, was the eldect son of the Right Hon. Lawrence Sulivan aum! the Hon. EUz7abeth Sulivan, youngest sister of Vfsco.iut Palmerston. He was educated at St. John's CoUege, Cam. bridge, and from there appointed to a clerkship in the Foreign-office, where he was successively Precis Writer and Private Secretary to Viscount Palmerston. After a 1 -u< course of diplomatic service at the Hague, Lisbon, Turin, and? Munich, and a successful settlement of the sulphur questiort at Naples, in coniunction with Sir Woodbine Parish. he was appointed Charg6 d'Affaires and Consul-Generat to Chili in 1S49. Tnis appointment he exchanged in 1852 for a similar one in Penu. During the five years that he, continued at Lim, he performed the duties of his st3tlon, with energy and success, and the sudden and mysterious ter. mination of his career, at the early age of 44, has oa%Uez !orth the deepest expression of sympathy and regret among. all classes of the inhabitants. He was buned in the British cemetery at Llma on the 15th of August, with every honour thut the Pernvian authorities could bestow, and no pains or expense have been spared to detect the anthora of the atrocious deed. Besides the enormous local rewards offered, a further reward has been offered br the British Government, and we still trust that so execriblea crime will not long go undliwovered and unpunished., GIo"
M0ONEY-MARKBT and OITYINTEBLLIGENO. Monday Evening. The funds opened this morning at the dull prices ,of Saturday, and a slight tendency to recovery subaequently manifested was not nuaintained. Consols -for money were firtst quoted 90 to i, and after liavinig touched 90 they returned to 901 for zoney, and 901 to J for the 14th inst. For the new account, the 10th of November, the last transretions were at 964. Towards the end of the day It transpired that the Bank have just granted to the East India Company a loan of a million sterlilg on India Bonds. The continued drain of go]d to the continent, the prospect that the delay in the resumption of specie remittances from the United States will be increased by the loss of the Central America, the uncertainty with regard to the further financial requirements of India, and the knowledge that among the European :Powers Austria, Russia, and Turkey are each in waist of money, and are merelv kept from the sul1arlket by the general pressure, also tended to check every sign of improvement, and to establish an -mpression that an adverse alteration in the rate of discount may be imminent. Before the receipt of the present advices from New York the best that could have been hoped was that the prevailina heaviness might not increase, and the prospect is now considerably more unfavourable. India Stock left offat 208 to 210; India Bonds, 24s. to 17s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, Ss. to 4s. discount. The rate for loans on Governmenteecuritiesin the Stock-exchange remains at 5 to 5A. per cent. In the discount market, although the 4th of the month isjust over, the inquiry is active, and a great demand is expected to-morrow to meet the double engagements which will fall due owing to the suspeDsion of all busineas on Wednesday. It appears that the next Indian news may now be expected at any moment. The homeward mail from Bombay last year arnived at Suez on the 29th of September, and, should it reach that port at the same date on the present occasion, despatches might be re ceived by the Government, supposing a steamer to be in waiting at Alexandria to proceed to Cagliari, in the course of to-morrow, or even this evening. The transactions in foreign stocks have been of an uninmportant character, but the market generally is well supported. Turkish Six per Cents. were negotiated for the account at 952 and J; ditto Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account, 99i and I ; Yrench Three per Cents., 8,J and i; Sardinian, 90 and 89 ; Spanish New Deferred, 25 ; Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 98 and 98i; and for the account, 98. The corn market was heavy this morning at the rate* of Monday isat. Ihe final quotations oftheFrenchThree perCents. on the Paris BeurLs this evening were 68f. 25c. for -money and 68f. 55c. for the end of the month, 6howing a decline of an eighth. The further large sum of 64,0001. in gold was withdrawn from the Bank to-day for exportation. The commercial accounts from New York to-day describe another fall of about 5 per cent. in all the leading speculative securities. Erie Railway was quoted 17 to i, Reading 4l , Michigan Southern 19, New York Central 66-, Panama 81, and Illinois Central 88, the Bonds 82. New failures had been reported from most of the important cities of the Union, especially at Boston, Philadelphia, Cincinmati, and St. Louis, At New York the chief addition to the list consisted of the firm of Cyrus W. YField and Co., connectel with the paper trade, the -chief partner in which has lately been in England as the most active promoter of the Atlantic telegraph. The house enjoyed a large business and good credit, and the stoppage is said to have been resolved upon in the absence of Mr. Field to prevent ruinous sacrifices. The rate of discount still ranged from 18 to 24 per cent., but the banks had greatly strengthened their position, and the ruin now aaily taking place seemed in most cases the result of blind alarrm Owing to the principal stoppages having been among manufacturing firms several tho,usand artisans had been throwrn out of employment. On the New York Exchange the Board of Brokers bad resolved by a large majority to maintain the wholesome regulation recently adopted for limiting the period for speculative transactions to 30 days. The stock of the Ohio Life and Trust Company was quoted Si, ancd it may therefore be preeumed a surplus is stiU expected after the creditors ehall have been paid in full.

Little hope, however, seems to be entertained that the assurance of peace -will lead to any improvement in the administration oif the Mexican finances or the prospects of the Engbssh bondholders. The question had been raised -whether England and I;rance in stepping in to adjuist the quarrels of the country, and thus to trenathen its independence, would not feel moraUy bouna to insist upon the claims of its foreign creditors beina duly provided for. Under existing circumstances their position could not be nmade worse, but might be benefited, by any violent change conrsequent upon the exhaustion from war, su::h as a dismemberment of the territory, a reorganization of Sts provinces, its absorption by the Ulnited States, or a return to a military dictatorship. The argument is that if otber Povers conme forward to avert these consequences and thus to deprive the creditors of such last chances as even anarchy might bring, the obliHation is involved of taking up their cause. he manner in which the leading Governments of the world continuo to hold terms 'with such States as Mexico, Venezuela, &c., is a blot upon the age. lf a private individual wvete to negotiate with blacklegs he would at once be disgraced, but it seems not to be thought unbecomning either for the Sovereign of Eng.land or F'rrnce or the Prosident of the United States to an?mit to their receptions the representatives of ilatioms for whose infamy and meanness it wvould be bard to find a parallel amoong the lowest choats of the turf or the gaming-table. Even apart from the toleration shown to the denial of justice to our bondholders, who have primarily no absolute claim to intervention, however justly they may complain of countenance bein,g afforded to their plunderers by the diplomatic courtesies from which ihey should be outlawed, there appears to be no -vOour in enforcing those rights which have actually be-en a subject of political arrangement. Thus, a convention entered into by Mexico in 1851 for the Oatisfaction of certain demands of British subjects. and whiach received the signature -of- _kr.

It is evident that from the action of their own Govern.3ent they get nothing but damage, and that a further illustration of that fact will now be afforded if 3Mexico is to be preaerved from the natural conse- <iuences of her career, withouit being at the same ±nn compelled to amend it. Annexed is an extract of a mercantile letter:- iThe news of the difficalty between Spain and Mexico aving been referred to the arbitration of England and 3Prance has given very great and nniversal satisfaction. Sor can It be doubted for one moment that If a war had been the consequence of such difficulty it would have proved dissons to both of the contendin parties, more especlly pehaps, to Spain, forshe has a large naanber of her esubjec3s spresd throughout thls republic, who are mostly men of property and more or less dependentuaron ths weal ef the country for theirowvn welfare.

' One of the leaders engaged in the San Viceate murders teyte by naim,e) was seized a few days since, and his conressions have thrown great light upon that Tnelancholy affair, at the same time that they have served also to detect one of his acconiiplices. The authorities are now in search of the latter, anid the chances are that the trial and exeaution of these crinuixlalU will remove at once the main cause of complaint held out by the Spanish Government. l" The time appointed for the meeting of the new Congress Vill now conme in a few days, but it is doubted if such an event will really take place. A considerable force has lately been congregated in the capital, and it remains to be seen if such mneasures have been adopted simply by way of precaution, or if Comonfort is really thinking of a coup detcat. " One of the incidents that have attracted public attention lately is the arrival in Mexico of some Americans, who l were knowvn to bring out instructions from their Govern- ment for a new treaty with Mexico, at the same time that they were to settle aU pending questions relative to Tehuantepec, and to make arrangements for the transit across that isthmus. The chief commisslonler is a senator (Mr. Benjamin) who is said to possess Mr. Buchanan's full confidence, and his negotiations with the Mexican Government are so far advanced that they are expected to come to a satisfactory termination every moment. It is said that the American Minister, Mr. Forsyth, will then have to begin fresh negotiations for a formal treaty; as a natural consenuence of which some few millions of dollars will have to be received by the Mexican Government." In the geineral business of the port of London during the past week there has been an increase. 'The total of ships reported inward Was 227, showing an increase of 29 over the previous week, These included 2S with cargoes of corn, rice, &c., 20 with sugar, 12 with fruit, 3 with cofibe, and 3 with tea. The number of ships cleared outwared was 123, including 20 in ballast, being a decrease of 1. The public debt of Russia is stated by the Patric to amount to 6,933,000,000f., about 277,320,0001. sterling. From a circular issued by the London directors of the Norwegian Trunk Railway it appears that the receipts for the past year have been $176,278, agaist $144,221 in the preceding year, and that after paying the interest on the 5 per cent. preference shares there will be a dividend of 3 per cent. on the non-preference and a small balance to be carried to a reserve fund. The Glencoe has arrived from China with 917,oOOlb. of tea.
RAILWAY IN2'RLLIGpaYCB. DUJBLIN AND DROC4nIT)A A speca1 meeting of this company was held on Friday in ; Mr. J. W. Murland in the chair. The Secretary, having read the notice convening the meeting, The CHARMSAY said, they had called the meeting for the purpose of obtaining authority to create and issue a certain amount of shares for the purchase of preference shares in the Dnndalk and Enniskillen Railway Company to the amount of 30.0001., and also to complete the purchase of the N avan brancb. At the last meeting of the proprietors a resolution was unanimoussly passed, giving the directors authority to purchase and hold 5 per cent. preference shares in the Diundalk and Enniskldlen Railway Corp fany to the extent of 30,0001. The diTrectors also proposed tossue shares to pay ofl the debt due to the Belfast June'don Company for the purchase of the Navan branch railway. In the year 1852 the directors -were authorized to issue 4 per cent. preference shares to the extent of lS5,0001. for this purpose. but it unfortunately happned soon after that the value of nmoney increased, and only about 45,0001. of these sbares were issued. They now wished to have the anthority of the meetig to issue the remainder of those shares at such i n rate of interest as would enable them to raise the monoy ! and pay off the debt due to the Belfast Junction Company in the course of the next two years. They were at present paying interest to the Belfast Junction Company at tlle rate of 5j per cent, for that money, and they were bound to pay the principal In r?ebruary, 1860. The total amount of shares they proposed to issue was 140,0001. worth, for paying off the Belfast Junction Company, and 30,0001. to pay for shares in the Dundalk and Enniskillen Company : together, 170,0001. They proposed that those shares should be issued at a fixed rate of o per cent. per annum, with power to tho company to redeem them at par at any time after the expiration of seven years, on giving holders of those shares six months' notice. They also proposed to give the bolderspower to convert those preterenceshares into ordinary shares of the company at any time during the next seven years. They were at present enabled to pay 4i per cent. on their ordinary shares, and if only one-third ofthe improveinent which bad taken place in their traffic during the past seven years should take plaoe in the next seven years it would be very much to the interest of the holders of the proposed preference shares to convert them into ordinary shares of the company. The proposed measure would not increase the preferenco charges of the comnpany. He coneluded by movinlg a formaF resolution authorizing the directors to create and issue the preference shares on the terms mentioned. After some observations f'rom Mr. WORKMA?q and other shareholders the resolution was adopted, and the meeting separated. | N~~~,ORWEGIAN TRUNK. The London direotors of this company in their repor' take the opportulnity of congratulating the shareholders on the already increasing traffic, which is shown in the follow. log summnary of receipts :-In l855, 1l9,946 dollars,- in Iq186, 144 221 dollars; and in 1857, 176,278 dollars. This development of the traffic is entirely attribut. able to the natural resources of that part of the country in which accommodation is provided by the railway, hot the contemplated extension of the railway system in Norway must prove highly advantageous to te shareholders by giving access to ,produotive and populous districts, and by making the line a means of direct communication between Stockholm and Christiania. '3 hese extensions have been determined upon by the Government,i anhd apbprovveOd sby the ptortoehfaing, n a line from Stromlmen, on the Norwegian Trunk rai1way to Kiongavinger, a distance of between 70 and 80 miles ; and thence to the Swvedish frontier at MTorast, where it will join the Swvedish line to Stockholm, formning a total distance of about 350 miles. A further line runs from Storhammar, on the Mlosen, to Elveruni, in Ostiodalen, the principal timber district of Norway. All the traffic on these lines will flo w into the Trunk Railway, and rennet fail to add considerably to the value of the under. taking. The revenue account shows that 17.5,653 dollars had been received, and 0°, 733 dollars expended, leavinga balance of 84,91¶l dollars (equal to 19,22,--.), which, added to 625 dollars from last year, makes 85,545 dollars * out of thisis deducted 49,875 dollar (11,2501. ),for dividend on preference shares6at 5 per cent., and 30,375 dollars for dividend on ordinary shares at 3 per cent., leaving 5,29t5 dollars to be carried to the reserve fund.

LAILWYAY AND MINING A3RHABS. Monday Evening. In railway shares a considerable decline has taken place in nearly all the speculative descriptions,which continued nfter official hours, the maarket closing without any sign of recovery. Caledonian, however, and Great Northern B stock exceptionally improved. Canadian shares were again filat, Grand Trank receding 17. and Great Western of Canada 15s. French were generally better, especially Paris and Orleans. Lombardo-Venetian also slightly improved, and Great Luxembourg were a shade lower. Notwithstanding the demand for Anerican securities, caused by the late heavy depreciation, the shares of Michigan Central and New York Central receded, and New York and Erie show increased weakness. In mines there has been a moderate amount of business, the chief alteration being an advance in Wheal Trelawney. In joint-stock banks a reduction occurred in Ottoman and Bank of Egypt. In miscellaneous securities a partial recovery took place in Canada Land, and London General Omnibus improved. On the other hand there was a decline in Netherlands Land preference.

THE COAAr TRADE. MAILK-LA1E, OKDkYAmRURvnnv nOm. n Last week's supplies were moderate. The oxports vwere 1,625 quarters of wheat, 334 quarters of oats, 10 quarters of beans, and 11 sacks of flour. The receipts of English wheat were 6,56G0 quarters ; of foreign, 5,814. There was a good show of samples from Kent this morning, but not from Essex. Full prices were first demanded, but former rates eventually taken, the basiness in red qualities being very heavy. The demand for foreign was limited, and prices unaltered. Of country flour there were 15,309 sacks; of foreign 371 sacks 130 barrels. Norfolks, being less plentiful, were about Is. per sack dearer. Town-made and foreign were as lastquoted. The quantity of English barley was 2,720 quarters, of foreign 2,101 quarters, The whole trade was quiet, there beirg most done in grinding samples. Malt found a steady inquiry at unchanged quotations. Of English oats there were 1,728 quarters, of Scotch 5.52 quarters, of Irish 6,930 quarters, of foreign 15,622 quarters-in all, only 24,832 quarters. The only change to be noted ivas in fine Irish samples, which, not being readily placed to distillers, scarcely sold so welL Of beans there were 908 quarters English, and 160 quarters foreign. Of peas 140 quarters foreign, aud 326 quarters English. I-Tew beans were dull, but old and all sorts of peas remained without variation of value. Linseed was more plentiful, there being 11,940 quarters, chiefly from India. The exports were 1,834 quarters. Without much animation, the market for seed and cake was firm. In the seed trade but little was passing, the inquiry for oloverseed and trefoil having for the preseut coeased.

He oommeneed by expressig his deep regre; that the defence of his olientihad not been intruatedto abler hands than his own. He, however, woel eadeaveer faithfully and fearlemsly to discharge his duty, and he had no doubt whatever that having done that the Lord Mayor -would immediately dismiss the summons. The whole of the case must depend materially upon wbhether his Lordship should be of opinion that the present summons had been applied for as an electioneering naue instead of a, bon4 fidc prosecution. He (Mr. lewis) would read from a newspaper the address of Mr. Humphreys -on the application for the summons, and should contend that it abounded with misstatements, acne of which he could not help thinking must have been knowa to the prosecutor. He hoped he should be forgiven if, in his anxiety to do justice to his client, he was compelled to make observations of a disagreeable nature; but, at the seme time, he was quite sure that Sir B. Carden would not think weU of him if he omitted any portion of bis duty. (Mr. Lewis proceeded to read the address of Mr. Humpbreys, as reported in this journal of the 28tk nlL, and to comment upon various passages, contending that the statements therein contained had not been justified by the evidence). It was clear fzom the evidence that the defendant bed for years been considered the fountain head in the conduct of aU contested elections in the city, and that Mr. DeputyKebbel andMr.lMillard had throughouttinduced'him to believe that he would be retained as the agent of Sir I. Carden until that gentleman repudiated the steps that bal been taken to insure his election. Mr. Millard had given his evidence in a manly way, and had worked in a most disinterested manner for Sir R. Carden. Mr. Kebbel admitted that he bad requested the defendant to call on him day after day for nearly a week, tickling and fiddling hin, and leading him to believe that he would be engaged as the agent for Sir Robert, till the worthy alderman had refused to sanction the projected measures for securing his return. Under these circumstances, it was not unlkely that when Mr. Deputy Kebbel at last said to the defendant, "Sir R. Carden will not do anything," the defendant, vho found be had been trifled with and prevented from seeking employment by the opposite party, said, " Then this (alluding to the placrd) nill go up to night ;" but he (MrLewis) could never believe that his client would have been such an asa as to use the words " Then tkis shall go up tonight "-words which no skdlful election-agent would ever have thought of uttering, especially in connexion with the election of Lord Mayor. No sum of money had been mentioned at the interviews between Mr. Deputy Kebbel and the defendant, and the latter, therefore, if he did use the words " Then this will go up to night," meant that as Sir R. Carden's party refused to retain him he would not use his influence to prevent the publication of the obceotionable placard by the opposite party. Mr. Lewis proceeded to contend that the placard was not a " matter or thing" within the meaning of the Act of Parliament which had been framed for the express prpose of preventingthe publication and circulation of malicious, defamatory, and wicked libels, and not for the purpose of preventing persons from issuing election squlbs. Time threat to publish must be made with intent to extort, before the presentcharge could be sustained against the defendant, who after having been played. the fool with for a v eek, had had an unfounded accusation made against him. The defendant felt that from first to last he had done no act to warrant the proceedings wrhich had been instituted against him, and that his character had been impugned by the statements that had gone forth on the application for the summons.- He had been made the victim of an electioneering juggle, aAd the only way in wvhich justice could be dealt out to him wfas by the dismissal of the summons. MIr. Huxnphreys said he claimned a right of reply, on account of a letter from Sir L Carden to Mr. Kebbel, which hadl been put in evidence by Mr. Lewis. Mlr. Lewis said he did not call for the letter, although itv;as produced in his cross-examination of M£r. Deputy hebbel. The LORD MAYoP.-The letter wvas read, and therefore I SUppOSB Mr. Humphreys is entitle to reply. hir. HIumpbreys said he was entitled to a reply, not only on account of the production of the letter, hut alao on account of his friends having read his (MIr. Elumphreys's) speech on making the application for the summons. Strong as the case wv3s before Mr. Lewils addressed the Coulrt in the defence, it wvas much stronger now, in consequence of the arguments he had used. There ws a very great deal of matter upon which his friend mnight have cross-examined SirR,. Carden, unless he had been perfectly satisfied tha' the answers of that gentlemnu wrould have been very disagreeable and uncomfortable to both himnself and hbs cieont. There were matters which Sir R. Cardent would have been very glad to have expiained, and which- he hod asked the Lord Mayor to alow him to explain the other day, but which his Lordship in the exercise of his disIcretion, and legally, refused to alow him to do. and w hich he wrould have explained to-day had Mr. Lewis given him the opportunity by asking him questions. HIe regretted ex-tremely that Sir K Carden had not been crosa-examined, because if he had been he would have put a diffe,-ent complexion upon some matters v;hich he (Mr. Humphreys) had no power to inquire into. The Act of Parliament said, " If any person shell publish orthreaten to publish any Hlbel upon any other, or shalll directly or indirectly threaten to print o2 publish or shall directly or indirectly propose to abstain from. printing or pnbliahing, or shall directly or indirectly offer to preventi the printing or publishing of any matter or thin,g touching any other person vwith intent to extort any money or eecunn for money" be' should be liable to punishment. Wht the deFsndant had said to Mir. Deputy Kebbel. in respect to the placard and his |threat in consequence of his not being employed, " Sirlieheri, (.ard en is out, and no mistake," together with the posting of the placard on the same evening, clearly brought the erfend ant within ths meaning of this Act efKlarli,unent. Tholer Lom xO;-I. feel satisfied in my own stlnd that al parties in this case are most anxious that justice should he done to each other. It is a case which I cm net inclined to decide upon, and I would much rather leave the whole rmatter in the hands of a superior tribunal. Therefore the better couerse for me to adopt is to send it for-trial, and then the judges wrill deoiAe whetheu there baa been any attempt to extort mnoney or not. Whatever tbe result o£ the inqjuiry, all pcartie6 wiL:then ho s&tisfied with it. The Lord 3Mayor then gave the defendant the usual caution, and a~ied him whether he wished to say anything£i answer to the charge? The lDefendant.-I am net r,iiltv Mr. Lewis. -I suppose the dofendanVa ovm recognizances will be sufficien 1?

LONDON, -TUBDA Y, OCTOBA?R 6, 1857. The nation has now been called upon, several timec within a very few years, to self-humiliation awl prayer on account of great sufferings and diafl. culOes. We have had visitations, as -we religiously a"l tem, of pestilence, of famine, and of war X ,* evAble scale, and of a heartrending character. Ee wocsion on which we are summoned toe ,nowr in one important respect comes much more home to us all as members of a powerful, wpiring, and self-respecting people. Rather in accordauce with uJage, perhaps, tban common sense, we affixed a certain arbitrary and purely judicial force to pestilence, famine, or war, as c4lamitiee having no sp>cial respect to any particular errors. In saed story we read that the Jewish Monarch was offered a choice of these evils for a crime which had no natural tendency to induce them; and it is euxtomary for religious people, on this and similar precedents, to expect public chastisements and warnings, the 'provocations of which are found in ordinary "besaetting sins" or the general catalogue of public scandals. In the present instance, Idwever, we are afflicted in one particular relation and in one function of our Peial.power. 1Zpe mutiny of an army which we had created _vyex, of which we were justly proud, and which W.e q*pectedto fiad our wiling aid in future achieve- is a calamity that does not send us far to - s'i for pomible causes and matters of self-accusation. It comes under the same Olass as the ingrati- tude of children or servants, the breaking up of families, or the discovery a man might suddenly make that he had not the love of his neighbours or the confidence of his fellow-citizens. Certainly, it was a great and honouirable feat to have won India, and held her so long, by means of her own best soldiers ; no less that from the other side of the world we could add new States, almost year by year, to that far distant dominion by the same means; that with it we covld terrify other powerful States into justice and peace; that we could therewith menace our most barbarous and most civilizedfoes; and find adependencyof 200,000,000 not a burden on our resources but an accession of power. All at once this pride, and this security, these splendid recollections, and this glowing future, have received a rude check. Near 100,000 men have turnc-d their arms against us, if not all at once, or with certain proof of conspiracy, yet with a readiness and accord even more mortifying to the self-esteem of their masters. Instead of confidence in us they have listened to the most preposterous inventions; in return for our confidence they have practised the basest treachery. When we supposed we had a good place in their social affections they have committed the most ruthless acts of cruelty. If all have not been equally forward in these outrages, all at least have acquiesced. The result has been one of the most horrid massacres to be found in history, plunging many hundreds of British families in grief, and distressing, mortifying, and perplexingthewholenation. The worse the conclusion we come to as regards the mutineers, the more it reflects on ourselves, and the greater the burden now cast on the political genius of the nation. What shall we think of all this? What are we to expect? What shall we do? What are we to blame in this matter? W'hat amendment shall we make? The calamity being of this special character, confined to our relations with one body of men, employed by us for one particular service, though, of course, exposed to a variety of influences, we see no reason for trave3ling beyond the circumnstances of the case, and imagining for the present purpose other sins and wickednesses than those which very naturally have led to the disaster. Grant that we have many social faults and national errors and shortcomings-grant that for many reasons we deserve all that we auffer, and require solemn calls to our duty; it appears to us, however, much more consonant vith truth, and much more doing what an overruling PRoviDzNc expects from us, to insist more on the faults and defaults of our relations with India, and in particular with its army. WVe see what has been often suspected, but, on the most convincing and lamentable of proofs, can no longer be denied,--that we have not succeeded in winning the confidence, the respect, and the love of the Sepoy, and of that large part of the Indian population connected with the army. We have not won the reverence due to ourselves as a nobler race. Our vast superiority in knowledge has gone for little or nothing. Our services to India have not been understood. The justice of our rule and the integrity of our judicial system have not enjoyed the appreciation we ought to have obtained for them. The superior beneficence and purity of our religion have not been so vividly and transparently exhibited in practice as to constrain the admiration and love of these miserable heathens, the dupes of the most ridiculous inventions and the foulest idolatry. We have not converted the people who have witnessed the everyday life of British gentlemen and ladies, we will not say to an acceptance of our religion, but even to any high regard for it. The highest religions of India, the purest professors of those religions, are to be found in the followers of MAuocmET and in the Brahminical castes. 13oth hold the most extravagant fables; both have one common feature of the grossest sensuality, and that kind of it which most debases the soul; both have ridiculous prohibitions; both are evidently doomed, soon or late, to disappear. The one are persecutors on principle, the other brutishly selfish and indifferent to the welfare of the rest of the world. Surely by this time Christianity, even under the prohibition of proselytism, ought to have shone out so conspicuously as to overshadowr and shame away the coarse stupidities and vile driveilings of either Mussulman or Hindoo. At all events, even conceding that a long established superstition, embodied in a social system, requires time to wear away, we ought to have stood high in that land of many religions as a consistent, believing, just, kind, and holy people. That we have not even done this, and that we are regarded simply as unbelievers, with little religion except a few negative tenets which we find convenientforpolitical purposes, must be deemed to prove a shortcoming in our practice. It must be our fault that we Christians stand so much lower in the religious scale of India than we did in the scale of ancient paganism. But, if we venture to say what ought to have been accomplished, and if we hold this fearful outbreak to prove an insufficient discharge of social and religious obligations, it does not follow that we are to fix the charge exclusively on the servants of the East India Company, or any porftion of them. On the contrary, we doubt if there is any class of perxons who so thoroughly represent the prevailing tone of English society, the standard of our morals, and in particular our mode of dealing with dependents, as the Anglo-Indian community, whether in the civil or the military service. It stands to reason, of course, that they must do so. They are fresh from our firesides; they are generally the best, the most promising, the most genial, the most loved, the most favoured of the youth in that very large and comprehensive body called the middle class of British society. It is from the higher mercantile and the professional classes that the Company's servants are chiefly selected; and from these sources they derive their maners, their mrorals, their religion, their politics. There is no need to inquire how far a different result would have been obtained had the range of selection been wider above or below. It is her middle class that England is proud of, and in it she finds her most characteristic development. That is the section of England that has been most established on the banks of the Ganges and throughout that vast continent, whether in its courts or its campe. We feel very sure that if no other country than England could obtain so quick, so quiet, and so complete a possession of that vast empire, so no other clasa but that we describe is so qualified for the undert3king. Indeed, aa we have said, it is pr&e eminently England, the England of politics, of enterprise, of freedom, of philanthropy, of justice and trutb. So, then, whatever the faults of the Anglo-Indian community, they are the faults of England, and, if we confess, it must be for ourselves. But we have only to look at home, to what is passing around us, even in this metropolis, to feel how miserably England belies her own lofty pretensions. What a gulf between the rich and the poor, the master and the servant I How little doea the one know of the other ! What sullen antipathies, what contemptuous exclusivenes, on the one side, what envious ignorance on the other, utterly alienate men bound together by their occupations and the neeeasities of existence I Securely trusting to the permanence of the soial fabric, and to the common instincts of private interest, wealthy, enlightened, and even kind-hearted men allow gloomy resentments, angry passions, and, sill worse, grovelling brutality, to go on below them, unchecked, unimproved, unheeded. We have only to suppose the actual relations of ,h4 classes the oame in India as at home, an&t there is quite enough to account for any amount of mutual ignorance, misunderstanding, alienation, and ultimate revolt. It is unnecessary to bring into the queation any particular measures or acts of the Indian Government. Governments only reflect opinions as they are composed, indeed, of the best accredited or most popular nlen. In this instance it is not the Governmert so much as the community that is reponsible, and that community only represents the moat energetic, and, so to speak, the most English, part of this country. We may, then, safely and reasonably interpret this most grievous and humiliating catastrophe into a general caU to a higher discharge of all our social and political duties. Such duties, of some sort, and in some degree, we all of uts have; for there is nobody whatever -who has not some one looking to him or dependent on him for sympathy, for guidance, for instruction. There are few persons of any modesty whose conscience has not whispered, " Look at " home ! " when they have heard of our Indian neglects and our Indian disasters. The merest accident or fatality, the strength of custom, the powerful fabric of opinion, the favour of PROVIDENCE, the inscrutable wisdom of an Almig,hty PowBB, may crown the same causes with very different consequences. British Christianity is much the same here as in India. It is exhibited by its professors in much the same practical colours. If the Christian rulers of India, as a class, are said to be selfish, heartless, luxurious, frivolous, indolent, sensual, and so fortb, aud if it is added that religion can never make mucn progress where it is so exhibited, what are we to say of the exhibition made in the same quarters at home? We cannot honestly say that there has not been any matelial difference of a sort to tell on the Indian mind between the English at home and the English in India. It is a fair specimen and an integral part of England that is gone out there. With a slight variation for circumstances, it is the same thing in both places. So let us join, if we please, in the summons to the East India Company and the Anglo-Indian community to act on higher principles, to rule India more for her good, to show a better example, to illustrate their holy faith in their I lives, to reconcile classes, to elevate the degraded, to enlighten ignorance, to melt the savage heart, and win back the bitter foe, Let us suppose the servants of the Company as idle and dissolute as we please, and trace these miseries and horrors to the hatred and contempt that they have brought on themselves. In such charges there must be some truth, so long as men are the subject. But let us remember that these are Englishmen, and of ourselves; nay, they are select and meritorious Englishmen; they are better than most of ourselves; and the call solemnly addressed to them is not less for our own hearing.
We do not know that there is any particular use in giving advice to a certain body in Sheffield which calls ibelf the " Foreign Affairs Committee," because we do not know that it is of any remarkable consequence what this body says or does. If it conducts itself absurdly, extravagantly, and impertinently we do not know that much harm is done. On the other hand,we do not know that much is gained by this body behaving with ever so much wisdom, temper, justioe, moderation, sagacity, and benevolence. It is a matter of entire indifference to the commulinity at large whether it is one thing or another. No consequences flow from either alternative-of wisdom or the absence of wisdom. We know nothing about this body. Its name and title will probably not have reached the world at large tiU we have communicated it. From this title it appears to be a self-constituted Foreignoffice, set up in rivalry to the one in Downgstreet; whether in harmonious rivalry or discordaut rivalry we cannot tell. The Sheffield Office for Foreign Affairs is, at any rate, an institution apparently meant to work side by side with the Secretary of State's Office, to correct its mistakes and supply it with instructions when needed. But here, again, we are puzzled, for what has a " Foreign Affairs Committee" to do with the Indian Mutiny? The Indian Mutiny is not a foreign event, but an event which has taken place withia the limits of the English empire, and upon soil governed by English laws and magistrates. However, the Sheffield "Foreign Affairs Committee" considers that the Indian Mutiny falls within its scope, and to that we have no objection, because how large a scope or how small a one is quite immateriaL Only, as it hss taken in hand the subject-matter of the Board of Control, we would advise it to insert that addition in its title, which would then be "the Sheffield Foreign-office and " Board of Control." The Colonial-office and the Home-office should also be inserted as fast as the Sheffield Committee appends these fresh materials to its domain. The Sheffield " Comimittee of Foreign Affairs,' then, has juist been carying on a correspondence with Mr. MUGxe, a clergyman of Bath, on the subject of an expression used by the latter in a speech at a public meeting at Bath. The expression used by MIr. MYAGm was, " We have to do " justice-needful justice-upon those wretches " who have so barbarously butchered our country" men and countrywomen." This is objected to as a sanguinary and abominable sentiment, and they recommend as a substitute for the execution of justice upon the murderers, "an investigation " into the cause of the revolt, and, if we " find any persons guilty, the execution of justice " upon them." Now, upon this substitution only one remark, perhaps, is necessary, which is, if auy punishment at all is to be awarded for these Indian outrages, the perpetrators of the outrages themselves should not be whoDy omitted from it. We do not know what new revelation on the subject of justice the Sheffield Committee may have received, but we apprehend that this is the true and natural idea of justice. The " Committee " appeas to allow that punishment is due for these barbarities; they do not stand up for them, they give them as indefensible, and admit that justice must be done upon somebody or other, only they feel an insurmountable difficulty against fixing on the criminal hiraself as tho object of it. This is strange and unaccountable. We can sympathize with many difficulties, but we are fairly puzzled how to argue with the Sheffield Committee, and penetrate to the grounds of their hesitation and get at the secret basis of their very esoteric philosophy of justice. We can easily understand that in the came of a large, a disastrous movement, likf, this Indian Mutiny, other men and other bodies of men may have incurred responsibility besides the actual mutineers. There are different kinds of responsibi' . There is the responsibility which is incurred by the burglar who breaks into a house, and there is the responsibility of the police in having kept such careless watch that he was enabled to do so. There is the responsibility of the rebel, and there is the responsibility of the authorities who comrittea the blunder which gave the occasion and handle to the rebellion. Our Indian Government has doubtleu not been free from mistake., and itwould have been a miracle if it had been. There have been indisputably great blunders committed by the authorities in India, and we may mount further up, and say that probably our general policy with respect to India might have been better, wiser, larger than it has been. Thtre are maistakes chargeable doubtless, more or fewer, to any Governor-General of Ind'a from COrvE downwards; there are mistakes which Courts of Directors have made, which the Board of Control has made, and which Parliament has made; still it is a new thing to hear, when one of the most horrible butcheries recorded in the annals of the human race has just taken place, and English blood has been shed like water, that we are immediately to dismiss the perpetrators of those barbarities from our thoughts, and commence an "investigation" into the conduct of the India Company and anybody and everybody who have had anything to do with India for the last fifty years. We must avert our eyes, forsooth, forthwith from these wretches for fear we should harbour one unkind thought against them; but we must erect a gallows fifty cubits high, on which we must hang all the present or quondam GovernorGenerals of India who are now alive, all the Director3, and all who have had to do with the Board of Control, not to say the English Legislature. There have been mistakes made about India, and, if there have been, these are the persons or bodies who have made them, and there;ore the justice of the Sheffield " Committee of "Foreign Affairs" selects them for its victims. This is true justice,-long-headed, far-seeing, soteric justice. That popular received theory, so celled, fixes on the criminal himself, and makes hiim ,mart for his crime;-short-sighted, blundering process indeed, simply to transport the actual personal stealer of your plate, the very ruffian who stopped you on the road and demanded your watch and purse ;-low, coarse, superficial justice to engage in a conflict with the " ipseity," as the Germans call it, of a housebreaker. Dismiss him from your thoughts, and punish the law instead. Justice should not be so mixed up with personalities. Depend upon it that the state of society, that Acts of Parliament} that the currency, or the Law of Settlement, or the taxes, are really responsible for his crime. Hang the Statutes at Large, they are the real offenders ; but do not wreak your " vengeance" on the miserable man who has only followed in thle wake of circumstances. Such is the justice of the Sheffield Committee. There is a massacre, and before a single act of punishment takes place on the perpetrators of it they demand an investigation into all the causes, near and remote, which led to it. A Board must sit-we suppose the Sheffield Conunittee is the most suitable one for the purpose-and conduct a general inquiry into the Government of India for we do not know how many years past, haul over all the minutes of all the Courts of Directors, and cross-question Mr. VEaxox; SmiT} and all his I redecessors now alive. This, we need not say, will be a long proceeding, and it will be very difficult to arrive at definite results; but when the criminals are got, and a number of a espectable old merchants, generals, and experienced legislators stand in the dock, we do not know what the Sheffield Committee, on its own principles, will be able to do with them; for exactly on the same rule on which the Indian mutineers can transfer their responsibility to these legislative culprits, these legislative culprits can transfer their own to some further set of culprits, whose maxims they followed. They will say, with great truth, that they did as well as they could, and adopted the best guidance that came to hand. Thus, one generation will hand on the guilt to another; all that people may choose to think harsh, or grinding, or rapacious in English policy will go back from son to father, from succeeding Parliarent to preceding one, from one whole generation of Englishmen to another, till, passing by Norman, Saxon, Dane, and Druid, we shall be thrown at last upon a very unknown original of all this disorder. In short, we cannot tell where the Sheffield Committee can stop short 'of the sin of our first forefather, and the conclusion of the "investigation" will be given very much in the form of the sudden summons with which Mr. SPUaaEoxN astonished his audience the other day, when, looking straight to the gallery, the preacher called out in a loud voice, " ADAMI, come forth, and answer for yourself." It is simple fatuity to think that justice can wait for the examination of all the possible remote causes which led to a particular act, or acted as an inducement to it, before it can punish a criminal. Such a rule as this would simply destroy society. It is sufficient for justice that a maan is guilty of a crime which he could have avoided committing. The most horrible crimes have never been without some or other stimulus or temptation from without. The Sheffield Committee asks triumphantly whether we should have any right to kill " a dog inten" tionally driven mad ?" The illustration is an unfortunate one, because, as Mr. MAGZE says, we undoubtedly should have; but, though this is certainly an instauee of the danger of trusting to an illustration, we wil notltake advantage of our luck. The ilustration is altogether a piece of nonsense. The Indian mutineer is not a "dog " driven mad" intentionaUy or unintentionally; he is a person who, after the best treatment, in cool blood and in the full possession of his reason, turns round and murders his benefactor."
About the 10th century of the Christian era there prevailed a general impression that the world was rapidly coming to an end. The prospect of approaching and almost palpable responsibility terrified the population of Western Europe into a -material amendment of life. Dissolute Princes forsook their evil courses, feudal Barons founded monasteries, and every petty potentate invested with authority employed it for the time under the salutary belief that an account of his doings impended over his head. The delusion soon became apparent, but the results were none the less real. The institutions established during the period of alarm produced their fruits in aftertimes, and aU classes of society derived advantages from a oonviction which, though mistaken in itself, represented in its general import a mighty truth, and created only a desirable state of mindl Much the same effects in another department of human duty may be ascribed to the terrors of the cholera. As a matter of fact, this dreaded malady is by no means so destructive to mortal life as others which are more silent and more ceaseless in their operation. It is even questioned by some authorities whether the novelty of character attributed to the disesse has any real existence, for the autumn seasons in this and otber countries have been distinguished by epidemio disorders of a similar kind time out of mind. Moreover, its attacks admit of prevention, and, in the earlier stages, of management, more effectually tban those of most other complaints, so that, upon the whole, if its victims are compared with the, victims of fiever, they will not appear numerous enough to account for the formidable attributes with which the former of these tvro plagues is invested in popular apprehenBion. Yet it is a fact, nevertheless, that the name of cholera will accomplish what cannot be done by the terrors of smaUpox or typhus, that it will drive us to set our houses in order, and will bring about improvements in the common arrangements of life which would not have been undertaken on any less compulsion. The General Board of Health z.mems to be wisely cognizant of its own opportuni. ties and of the popular disposition. As it happens, the fatal epidemic haa shown itself this summer or, the shores of the Baltic, so the Board improves tb*e. oceasion without loss of time, and brandishes, in the face of the British public that particular we,eon; w'nich alone is liksly to command respect. There is prohA2bly little ground fer alar4, it there is certainly every reason for action. It is true enough that parts of Denmark and Northern Germany have been visited by cholera, but if the facts of the case could be ascertained we should learn, in aU likelihood, that this malady has rarely been absent from the North of Europe. It seems to be almost as much naturalized in St. Petersburg as in Bombay; and we may cease now to believe that it is generated for each occasion in the sultry plains of Asia, and transmitted across the continent on a definite track until it strikes the shores of England. More or less it is probably always near us, though the accidents of a season may be necessary to intensify or disseminate the poison. We approximate insensibly to the truth of the case -when we speak of " English" cholera. Cholera is of all countries and of all climates, nor is its tendency to become suddenly epidemic or destructive at all a peculiar one. Almost any diseases may become epidemic under certain conditions, as we have seen in the prevalence of influenza, of ophthalmia, of neuralgia, or of boils on the skin. But beyond the single fact that there is cholera in Germany there does not seem much ground for apprehension at present. If complaints of the bowels have been common this summer, the fact is nothing more than was naturaUy to be anticipated from the severe and protracted heats of the season. If choleraic disorders are contingent upon the operation of autumn suns they would, of course, be more universal in proportion as the features of the season were more strongly declared. The truth is, however, that they have been rapidly decreasing of late, and that the weekly barometer of the REoIsTIAR-GExmSAL shows a steady decline at this point. Yet, notwithstanding all this, -we must needs urge upon the public the propriety of conforming to the behcsts of tho Board, and for this simple reason,-that those behests enjoin nothing more than common decency and common prudence demand of themselves. Though the world may not be comning to an end people ought still to lead godly lives. The " suggested possibility," as the Board mildly describes the present ocasion, may not become a serious reality, but the measures of cleanliness recommended should need no extraordinary terrors to enforce them. They are precautions not merely against cholera, but against aU the worst forms of other diseases-they are directed against habita which make life at all times unwholesome, painful, and precarious. If they have any special bearing upon the particular malady in question it is because cholera is at once unusually abrupt in its visitations, and unusually amenable to preliminary vigilance. The epidemic occasionally manifests itself with such terrible violence that there is no room left for resistance at the minute, whereas actql experience has proved that precautions adopted beforehand suflice frequently to rob the pestilence of its poison and send it harmlessly away. The circular now issued by the Ceneral Board contains two of these encouraging iUustrations; one referring to the ordinary purification of streets and dwelling-houses, the other to improvement of the water supply. At Tynemouth, in Northumberland, the visitation of cholera in 1848-49 fell so heavily as to occasion serious losses both of life and property. In 1852 sanitary improvements were instituted and prosecuted with great vigour, and at the very first manifestation of the epidemic at Newcastle in the ensuing year the policy thus happily established was enforced without a moment's delay. The result was that the town, which five years previously had lost 463 of its inhabitants, then lost but four; while Newcastle and Gateshead, in its immediate vicinity, were ravaged by the scourge. The importance of pure water to a population is shown by statistics of a most striking character, drawn from the southern districts of this metropolis. Of the tenants of two particular water companies there died in the epidemicof 1848-49 thenumbers,respectively, of 1,925 and 2,880. One company, represented in the former of these sums, improved its supply considerably before the next visitation of cholera in 1853-54, and of its tenants there then died only 611. The other permitted its supply to become worse in the interval, and the deatbs among its customers amounted to 3,476. These are broad facts, but smaller incidents, almost equally instructive, wvill suggest themselves to the reader's memory. One of the most violent local outbreaks in London seemed to be associated, as far as it was traceable at all, with the water of a particular pump; and it was matter of common remark that a good model lodginghouse, well built, well ventilated, and properly tenanted, secured impunity to its inmates even in unhealthy situations. With such evidence before us, It would be worse than folly to remain inactive, whatever may be the probabilities of another visitation. Although, indeed, we do not descry any reasons for present alarm, we regard the contingency as one to whicb we are always liable. We are disposed to look upon cholera less as an imported plague than a natural peril. The seeds of diseases, cholera included, are always about us, and may at any time be developed into epidemic maladies. But, though the terrors attaching to any special transmission of the disorder from Hamburg may be groundless in themselves, they may render good service to the community. We have heard that the apprehensions entertained of the comet some months ago produced a visible improvement in the morality of certain districts, and perhaps the phantom of the cholera may be relied upon for effects equaUly salutary and a good deal less transient. Visitations of pestilence are matters beyond human scrutiny, but when the precautions against them amount only to simple and self-evident duties we ought never to be found unprepared.
Tis FAST DAY.-It is our intention on Thursday next to publish the texts and a short summary of the sermons preached on the day appointed for prayer and humiliation at the most important of the metropolitan and provincial churches. WYe have taken measures to obtain reports of some of the principal congregations; but, as it is obviously imposible for any establishment, however extensive, to do justice to all the discourses delivered on such an occasion, we shall be glad to receive from the preachers themselves a short account of their sermons, and of the amounta reoeived from the congregation wherever a coUection has been made. It is obvious that where so many sermons will deserve notice none can be reported at length, and we must therefore urge on our correspondent, the importance of extreme brevity in- any reports with which they may favour ua.

THE LATE BABL .FITZWILI.AM, K.G. The Right Hon. Charles William WentworthFitzwilliam, third Earl Fitzwilliam, Viscount Milton, of Norborough, county of Northampton, and Baron Fitzwilliam in the peerage of the united kingdom, and also fifth Earl Fitzwilliam and Viscount Milton in the peerage of Ireland, whose death was announced in our impression yesterday, was born in Grosvernor-square, London, May 4, 1786; so that at his death he was in his 72dear. He was the only son of William, fourth earl (sone time Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland), by his first wife, the Lady Oharlotte Ponsonby, a daughter of the second Earl of Besmborough, and great grandson of Thomas, Marquis of Rockingham, whose title it was at one time rumoured was intended by Earl Grey for the deceaed Peer's father. The nobleman so recently deceaed was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and represented the county of York in the Lower ouse in seven suCcessive Parlianments, between the years 1807 and 1833, and succeeded to the Earldom on his father's death, February the 8th, 1833. In the House of Lords he was a stanch but not indicriniinating supporter of the Liberal Government, which, how.- ever, he occasionally opposed by both voice and vote, as on the debate stirred at the commencement of t}e present year relative to the China question, and the conduct of Sir John Bowring inregardto theArrow. In 1853 he was appointed a deputy-lieutenant for Northamptonshire, and in 1856 received the Royal license authorizing him to adopt the surname of Wentworth before that of Fitzwilliam, as it had been previously used by his father, to mark his descent from Thomas, first Marquis of Rockingham, to which we have alluded above, his grandmother having been sister and coheir of Charles, the second and last Marquis. He was honoured with the blue riband of the Garter in 185L Earl Fitzwilliam married in 1806 Mary, fourth daughter of Thomas, first Lord Dundas, and sister of the first Earl of Zetland, by whom, who died November 1, 1830, his Lordship had issue-first, Williar Charles, late Viscount MTilton, who was born ia 1812, and who died in 1835, having for a short time represented the Northern Diviion of Northamptonshire, without leaving male issue by his wife, Lady Selina Jenkinson, a daughter of the Earl of Liverpool; second, William Thomas Spencer, the present Viscount Milton, who was born ia 1815, and married in 1838 Lady Frances Douglas, eldest daughter of the 18th Earl o£ Morton, by whom he has a numerous family; third, George, M.P. for Peterborough, who has represented that borough since 1841; fourth, Charles William, who has sat for Malton since 1852. He has also left four dargahters, of whom one ig Lady MIackenzie, of Scatwell, county Boss, and the youngest is the wife of the Right Hon. R. Verr on Smith, M.P. The present Earl was M.P. for Malton from 1837 till 1841, and again from 1846 to 1847; he wras elected for Wicklow i the Parliament of 1847, and reelected in 1852 and in the present year. He was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel commanding the Weet York Yeomanry Cavalry in 1846, a Deputy-Lieutenant for the West Riiding of Yorkahire in 1853, and Lord-Lieutenant of' the West Riding on the death of the Barl of Harewood early in the present year. In 1565 Hugh Fitzwvilliam, Esq., of Sprotburgh, in the county of York, collected the records of the ancient family of Fitzwilliam, from which it appears that they trace their pedigree up to Sir WVilliam Fitzwilliam, Arnbassador at the Court of William, Duke of Normandy, who attended that Prince in his invasion of England as marshal of his army, and for his valour at the battle of HIastings was presented with a scarf from the arm of the Conqueror. His son married the heiress of Sprotburgh, which continued in the posseion of the family in a direct line of succession down to the reign of Henry VIIL In that reign wve find his descendant, Sir Willism Fitzwilliam, of Milton, Northamptonshire, and of the city of London, serving as Sheriff of London ine 1506, and subsequently alderman of Bread-street Ward. He had been for some time in the retinue of Cardinal Wol3ey, and, retiring to his house at Milton, there gave his old master a kind reception in the hour of his disgrace. For this conduct he was rebuked by the King, but replied that he had not acted out of contempt for his Highnees, but out of gratitude towards his fallen nmaster. Satisfied and pleased with the answrer, King Henry knighted him on the spot and made binm one of his Privy Council. His grandson, Sir William Fitzwiuiam, was Lord Deputy and Lord Justice of Ireland from 1560 to 1594, and is thus noticed by Fuller in his UWorthies of England:- " Sir Wiiam was Sive times Lord Deputle of Ireland,-a suflident evidence of his honesty and ability, Queen Elzabeth never trusting twioe where she was once deceived in a Minister of State. And she also preserved him in the power of his plaoe In that sendlng over Walter, Earl of Essex, to be Governor of Ulster, the Earl was ordered to take his commission from the Lord-Deputy." The grandson of this Sir WiUiam wa raised to the Irish Peerage in 1620 as Baron Fitzvilliam, of Lifford, county Donegal, and his successor, in 1716, was advanced to the earldom of that kingdom. The third earl of the Irish Peerage who was made an English Peer in 1742, and advanced to the English Earldom four years subsequently, was the grandfather of the nobleman whose decease it is now our painful duty to record in these columns.

TUE LOS3 OF PHE TRASIT. The foUoving is written by an offloer who went out in the ill-fated Transit:- "Islaad of Bans, 2'20 miles iroa Singaporo, Sunday, July 12. "Long before this reaches you the telegraph will have unformed you of the total wreck of Her Majesty's ship Transit, on which I was a passenger. " The casualty took place at half-past 9 am. on the 10th; she struck on a sunken rock two miles from a reef, a por. -tion of which is discernible at low water, and eight mniles 'from the mainland; the sea was like a mirror at the time. "The commander, Captain Chambers, and the master, were on tha bridge; the ship was steaming slowly, about four knots, and the leadsman had just called out nine fathoms. We had not at first any just conception of the extent of the Mdanger, but hoped that by throwing all the guns overboard -we could possibly get her off. About five minutes elaped, and I was proceeding along the troop deck to visit some -alak men and offilcers, when I saw the water rushing with -reat violence along the floor of the engine.room, and in about another minute the fires were extinguished. I ran -forward nd ordered all the sick men out of the forecastle, 'that bhey might be at hand in case things tarned out badly. -On my reaching the poop it was evident that she was settling down on her stern, leaning a little to the starboard; -nd, though the soldiers worked like lions at the pamps, the -water rose to the troop deck and rushed iato the saloon -and cabins. Meanwhile efforts were being made to secure some biscuits, pork, and rum, which were passed on to the -forecastle, as it was evident that the ship should be aban-doned. " While the soldiers were thus occupied under the direetion of their officers the ship's cre-w were getting out their '-boats, and in about two hours they were aU lowered. It took this length of timne to effect this, as the heavy boats -were midships and the Transit was fearfully undermanned. " The first boat lowered was despatched with the Second Lieutenant to Aminto, a Dutch settlement 16 miles off, to -solicit assistance and a despatch boat to proceed to Singas -pore for a vessel to take as from this. "The remnainder of the boats were now ready. The firs' -'ombarked were the sick, a oompany of the 90th, and a oom <pany of the 59th, and they were, landed on the reef. They bad to be landed there, as if they proceeded to the island -those on the ship would, in all likelihood, have sunk before the return of the boats. These were four times fiUed before all on the ship were in safety. The ship's crew, wbo were ,the last to leave, went at once to the island, and the boats ithen made three trips to the reef for those of us who wera 'on it. It was dark before all were lauded. This was not attained too soon, as the rock on which we stood gradually became covered by the rising tide, and was totally hid from .sight before the last of us had reached the land. ' Except the clothes in which we stood, everything was tost, except the firelocks of the soldiers, which they carried vith them. It was impossible to save the knapsacks. "30 tons of powder, all the shot and shells and small arm -ammunition, all the stores, the mediiesl comforts, commis-saist tents and baggage, in fact, everything has boen lost. *The vessel, however, has not yet sunk, though under water *rom the funnel sternmost, and split in half both on the port and starboard. The rock on which she split holds her securely until a gale of wind shall scatter her to pieces. " You will, as an old soldier, be glad to hear that nothing -eould have been more truly heroic than the conduct of the 'men; it was splendid, and worthy of antiquity, or shall I say of the Dritish soldier ? When first the crash came all -the men on the troop-deck nmade a rush to the gangway, 'but Major Burnston, 90th, ordered every man back to his mes. This command they initantly obeyed, though the ship was trembliDg like a frightened child, and they could hear -and see the water gradually rising to their feet. Had this order not been given and obeyed, no biscuit or pork could 'have been saved; and when at last the men were ordered on "the quarterdeck to embark there was no rushing or confusion, the first party moved off and the remainder stood a: -ease with the order and precision of a Sunday parade, though they could see and feel the ship gradually sinking "Some who could secure nothing elss succeeded in securing -their Bibles, and this morning, in the presence of the wreck, -we returned thanks to that Almighty Saviour to whom we 311 feel indebted for our safety. " We have much to be thankful for. Had there been a a rough sea the ship must have gone to pieces, and it must bave washed off the reef those who could have reached it. Thank -God ! we are all alive, weeU, and on a very beautiful island. abounding in fresh water, pine apples, cocoanuts, and bananas. This day she pork and also some sails were secured and we are aU under canvas. Colonel S- -, Scott Fusileer Guards, is in command, and there is, in my opinion, no man better fitted for high comnumand, as, with a temper most enviable, he has a calmness, firmness, and self-possession 'which has proved of essential service to all of us. He -was the last of our party to leave the ship. " I trust that this disaster may lead the Admiralty to consider the propriety of sending out no more troops In transports not seaworthy, and the necessity of providing some means of loweriDg the boats speedily, and of having a sufficient nuamber to rescue all on board, as, If we had not been so close to the shore, not a third of our nu.nber could ltave been saved. " From the hour we left Portsmouth we wer', in danger, as on leaving the dock the fan of the screw, wvvich had not 'been raised. came into collision with the doek. The fan was positively broken, and the concussion caused a leak aft which could not be stopped. The Transit ex-ecept the wind was on the quarter or beam, would zot answer her belm ; the sails did not fit her, and were very old. On the 22d and 23d we lost tho foresail, foretopsail, the mainsail, ard maintopsail The mainyxrd, made of indifferent timber, broke in half like a rotten stick, and one of the plates of iron of which the ship is built broke in two below water mark. I need not toll you that it was almost impossible to prevent the vessel from foundering ; indeed, I-ad the gale not abated nothing could have saved us. You cannot conceive the extent of the danger. It may belp you to do so when I teL you that on the 24th we pumped out of the wretched ship 600 tons of water. 600 tons ! At home you will esteem it a most unfortunate and disastrous occurrence that we should be lost. I believe there is not a soul among us who did not thank God for our being wrecked wbere we were, as if we had proceeded to the Chinese Seas and met a typhoon, or even a heavy gale of -wind, the Transit must have sunk, and all of us been lost. For my own part, I esteem it a most merciful occurrence. " There is no doubt that we shall all have the sympathy of the pesple of England. I trust thev will be not only merciful, but be as they ever are, just, and not hastily blame the captain or the master. It may not be right in a landsman to pronounce an opinion, but, as I have now bad some experience, I can safely assert that no two men could have displayed more vigilanoe and anxiety-I imight say painful anxiety-from the hour we left Port. mounth. They kneow what we did not-our fearful danger, but always displayed somuch cheerfulness as really to lead us at times to imagine that she was the finest vessel ever Boated. "' It will be remembered that the master navigated the fimala-ya in all the rapid voyages sbe made in the last war, and is weU known at the Adairalty as a most accomplished ;nan. " Perhaps you wi be so good as to have my letter for. warded, as I know not where I shall be, and have written to them to forward this to your offiee. '" I have saved my writing-desk and Bible, and others a low trifles. i have lost to the value of almost 2004"
FRATRICIDE IN LIVERPOOL. Las bght(Snda) instLIVERPOOL, OcTr. 5. Lst night (Sunday) a most :unnatural muder was com*nmutted in Trowbrldge.eet e AtNo.48 in that atreet lived a family auwsed Jones, butchers, consisting of the mother, Mmbeth Jones, a daughter, and three men, Robert Jones, the deceased, aged about 40, Wiliam Jones, aged 38, and a yotnger brother named JohnI. Last night, while William and the deceaed were at supper, about haltpsat I1 o'clock, they quarrelled, when WiUiam Jones drew his butcher's abieath.ikfe,a fornaidable weapon, and stabbed his brother in the left breast. The younger brother John, entering at that moment, saw the woand inflictedL Crtes *of " Murder '" we raised, and police-officer 29, 'who was on that beat, came in. He found Wiliam Jones in the passage wih tLe knife atill in his hand, and, in answer to hia question, he said th.at that was the weapou with which he had inflicted the wound. Officer 11 (Dixon),) who accompanied officer 29 took the prisoner to the BrideWrell, and the deceased, who wa Tying tho bottom of the atairs, apparently dead, was -conveyed by officer 29 to the In6rrnary, where Dr.Alea )rono.nced life to be extinct. The decemed was not a tbter himself, but drove a butcher's cart for a Mr Smitb. Some time before the murder the deceased and the sinsoner 'were at high WrOIds, the neighbourhood was thrown into disorder, and the two officers had been ordered to remain nearthe bouse by the inspector. They wre therefore in the immediate neighbourhood when the blow waa struck. The prisoner was brought before the stipendiary mag3strate 'to-day.

M ThIITARY AND NA AL INTELLIGENOB. On Saturday 50 uon.cor0or e1d officers mad mne;, belonging chiefly to the 1st RoY-Is, the 31st, nd the 92d HighLanders, arrived at St. May's Barrcn, Chatham, in chargo of Lieutenant F. Y. Caseidy, the 31st Regiment having been sent horns from Gibralat on account of their unfitness for further service. As soon as the troops have been in-pected by a Chelsea board of officers they will be diseharged from the service. Her Majesty's paddlewbeel steam veieel Avon, tender to tho flagship at Devonport, arrved at Woolwich on Sunday evening, bringing Captain Charles M'Arthur, First-Lieu. tenant John Cairncros, First-Lieutenant Albert Higma, Second-Lieutenant C. E. Stanbridge, and 40 rank and file of the Royal Marine Light Infantry, paid off at Plymouth from the scraw steamship Orion, 91, late from North Axerica and the Wst Indies. The Avon is to return to-day to Devonport. The Diligence naval transport having discharged her cargo at Woolwich, from Gibraltar, was yesterday docked for repairs, and the harbour-service frigate Bacchante was yes. terday despatched to Chatham in tow of the steamers Moakey and Widgeon. With a view to extending the use of Clifford's boat lowering gear in the naval service generally the Lords of the Admiralty have ordered models of the necessary fittings to be received at Woolwich, so that the system may be carried out in Her Majesty's shipa. Two re markable cases of the efficienoy of the system oc. curred on board the screw frigate Shannon, 51, Captain Peel ; when under full sail, and with heavy press of canvas, the boats were lowered and lives were saved without staying to round the ship to, or in any way slaoken her speed, as in the case of the Transatlantic, narrated in Ti%c Times of yesterday. What was looked on as foolhardiness in the inventor nine months since by naval men of any experience, when in the gale of January last he manned a boat with a full crew, and taking his place with them lowered It from just behind the paddlewheel of the steamship Dee, the vessel being then at full speed, has now become a matter of repeated practical application and utility, shown to be the mere result of simple mechanical principles. Mr. Clifford has exemplifaed his principle some hundreds of times, by beinig lowered from vessels of all kinds at most of our seaport and dockyard towns from Aberdeen to Plymouth. The following appointments were made yesterday at the Admiralty:- Lieutenants Hl. Hand and A. H. Webb (additional), to the 'Vesuvius, for disposl ; Charles G. Jones, mate, to tke Excellent; Edward Denny, mate, to the Cornwallis; Henry R. J. Pearch, acting second-master, to the UIrgent C. R. R. Smith, midshipman, to the Styx; Walter Stewart, midshipman, to the Diadem; S. S. Smith, midshipman, to the Hastings; C. E. D. Wilcox, midshipman, to the lIawke. THE MJILITIA. The La icasbire Militia Artillery assembled at the Islington Barracks, Liverpool, yesterday morning. The musterroll was considered highly satisfactory. The 7th Lancashire Riifes are becoming a most efficient regiment. On Friday the officers waited on LieutenantColonel Madocks, commanding, to atate that they and their men were anxiois to be embodied and willing to go wherever their services were required. Their gallant chief promised to represent their -wishes to the proper authorities. The corps is armed with the new rifle, The Cardiganshire Militia has asembled for training. The regiment is in an efficient stle. The Rtoyal Carmarthen Rifles have just concladed their period of training. The regiment numbers 200 men.

Slr,-I have read with surprise a letter in phe imes of the 3d inst., signed " An Anglo-Indian, not of the Old School," in which the writer takes the liberty of associating me with a correspondent of The 71mes under the signature of " P.," as having a common opinion 'with " P." in his advocacy of what he designates the traditional pol¢y in the administration of the affairs of India, and which policy the " Anglo-Indian" pronounces to be-among other allegations that of-" the entire negation on the part of the Government of -ts Christianity," and also its "encourage. ment of Hindooism and Mahornedanism." I shall leave the glaring contradictions in the letter to those who handle syllogisms, and limit myself to the personal reference,-I am said to approve the traditional policy ; ergo, I am implicated in the "entire negation on the part of the Government of its Christianity." There are parts of our traditional policy, as construed by " P.," in which I never have concurred; but the policy of keeping faith, as pl&'ged by treaties and proolamations to give perfect i toleration to all religions-Hlndoo, Mahomedaz, Catholic or Protestsnt-has ever had my entire approvaL But the assertion of " Anglo-Indian" that we have denied our owV religion is utterly disproved by the facts of the organization of cathedral establishmenta and bisboprics at the three Presi-1 dencies, of new churches having been built and chaplains appointed to every military station from the Himalayas to Cape Comorin, and of the entire freedom given to missionary labours of all denominations throughout India within the last 50 years. In the face of these facts, how does "Anglo-Indian" venture to assert that we deny I our Christianity in India? Indeed, among his contradictions he himself states the reverse, for he says the demonstrations of our Christianity frighten Jindoos and I Moslems. The denial of Christianity, therefore, has been no part of our traditional policy ; certainly no part of the policy I have advocated. Bnt I have advocated the non-r interference of Government with the religion of its subjects, on the gronnd that where argument and discussion could not prevail between man and msan compulsory in. terference would be tyrannical as well as dangerous, because, as Enrorean in India are only as ons European to 4,5O of the natives, we must necessarily go to the wall iu any physical conflict with them upon religious grounds. Bnt, says " Anglo-Indian," there never has been compulsory inter. ference; and my reply is, that his assertion is unfounded, in fa4t, that the mutiny in the Madras army in 1800 and !macre of Vellore were occasioned by an attempted compulsory interference with the religion of the Sepoys, and that the presont lamentable revolt of the Bengal army has beea occaioned by the frantic delusion of the Sepoys that they were to be deprived of their religion by an act of tho Government; and I have no hesitation in publicly stating my thorough conviction that, but for the fatal punishment of the 85 troopers at Meerut to ten years' confinement in irons, with hard labour as felons, for reaisting the compulsory use of the suspected cartridges, the first instance in 100 years in Bengal of Sepoys, in combination, irmbruing their hands in the blood of their offloers vould not have occurred. In short, hbad the policy adopted by Colonel Montresor in the contingent force at Byderabad in 1806, in abrogating a dangerous order upon his own responsibility, been adopted at Meerut, we might still have bad a loyal Bengal army as we still hav a loyal Madras army, although the latter had, 51 years ago, revolted upon religious grounds. The new school " An glo-Indian twioe ask in a triump. hant tone, "Whst has been gained by thi traditionay polioy r My reply iY, that the " traditlonal policy," whatever it may have been, has expanded two small mercantile factorie4 upon the banka of the Hooghly and the Taptee into an empire, as an appendap of the British Crown, which would have excited the envy of Alexander the Great and Augustus Cscsar; and I affirm that the East India Company is entitled to the Iseting gratitude of their countryme for such a marvellous reeult vf their administration. In conclusion, I would saggest to the " Anglo-IndIan," who professes to have had an offical connexion with India, that he should have omitted my name from his imput tions, or had the manliness to put his real name to his letter.

IRELAND. (FuoMX OUR OWN CORR15RPOr - DUIBLIN, -oMN&A MosmoG. EDtUATIO.I-THE QUEeS UNIVERSITY. On Saturday afternoon the degree examination o f students in the Queen's University in Ireland wat4 held in St. Patrick's-hall, DIublin Castle, before the Lord Lieutenant, the Chancellor, and the other members of theSenate. The general attendance waz large and influential. At S o'clock a procession, consisting of the students, profewors, members of the Senate, and Vice-Chancellor, entered the hail, and proceeded totheir appointed places. The LordLieutenant shortly after arrived, and was received by the Vice-Chancellor, who conducted him to his place, which was on the right of the Vice-Chancellor's chair. All gentlemen belonging to the University appeared in tbe robes and academnic costume proper to their respective positions. The proceedings were opened by the Lord Chancellor, as ice-Chancellor of the University, -who, in a ver able address, furnished the following statistics wit regard to the progress of the institution:- "On this the seventh occaaion of the assenmbly of the Senate of the Queen's University to confer degrees and honours on the students of the Colleges of Belfast, Cork,and Galway, I have the gratification of announcing an important increase in the numsberof thecandidates forthese distinctions above those of the classes of 1855 and 1856. Eleven studenta blivepassed the required examinations for the degreeof Doctor ci Medicino,and an equal number have passed the first medical examination preparatory to their proceeding in a future year to that for this degree Nine have passed the e-mination for the degree of mster of Arts, 27 have been considered qualified by the examinersfor tie degree of Bachelor in that Facalty, anid three for that of Bachelor of Laws ; one student is deemed worthy of our diploma of Elementary Law, one of that of Agriculture, and one of the dipiona of Engineering, making altogether the number of 65 collUedate students whose names are to be placed on the records of the University, a number considerably exceeding that of the higbeet former ear, 1853, when 46 were so preeented, and more than double that of last year, which was only 32 We have also on this occasion one candidate from Trinity College for admission to the ad eunde degree of Doctor of Laws, and which the senate has authorized me to confer npon him pursuant to the powera of our University Charter.' The Chancellor next touched upon the question of competitive examination, referring with just pride to the success of the puDils from the Queen's Colleges at the lsst examination for Civil appointnients in the Indian service:- " In addition to this progress of the membersof the University, I have greatpleasure in notioing at this meeting the marked success of some of our students in the competitive examination held for publicdepartments. I allude more especially to three young gentlemen-hess. Beveridge, Bartley, and Smith, all students of the Queen's College of Belfast, who succeeded in obtaining appointments in the Civil Service of the East India Company at examinations held in last July for those very importaut plAces; and I may fitly mention here that I beheve It will be found that since the establishment of competitive examinations for the public service a larger proportion of the students of the Queen's Colleges, as compared with the *ctual number of the entire body of those stnenb, has been successful in obtaining the appoiltments so competed for than in any other university. This success is of peculiar value in estimating the true quality of the education given to their students by the respective colleges The degrees and honours of this University are sought and competed for by those students, as it were, among themselves, and might be said to give but a positive test of excellence resting on acquirements in course of study which are almost uniform in the three colleges. In the competitive exansintions for the public service they encounter the students of other colleges aud universities; the test is compuative, and it isa trying one, and each college may justly feel honoured in the triumph of its successful student." This portion of the address necessarily suggested some reflections upon the present unhappy state of affairs in India. "The topic caUs before our minds the responsible duties, the high destinies, perhaps, which may be the lot of these youthful students, and of those with whom they will be associated, in the future maintenance of British dominion In that dstraed portion of theempire, We are now suddenly plunged for its preservaton in the throes and agonies of the $rsngest and most aw ful conficlt that ever in human memory has raged upon the wide surface of the globe. Every page of daily intelligence, every massage that rushes on electric wings from the Eastern world is fraught with tidings of death and desolation, of horrors the most ap. palling. We tremble as we read, fearinR that the next senen.e may announce not only the loss of thousands of our countrymen and countrywomen, but the utter wreck of all the great fabric of dominion which we have been building up In the vain hope of establishing peace and civilization n lands long torn by the cruelty and oppression of barbarian conquerors. While thousands of families are either pining in hitter Affliction for the cruel destruction of near and dear ones, or listening with agonizing terror for some faint sound of assurance tbat those! they love may yet be found amone the Hymn sam thn, reeP_nn 5i.h .4 pressure of publia calamity and private misery, to do or tbink of ought savo the arousing and display of aU the energies of the realm for the restoration of sovereignty and peace, or the practical direction of the means at our disposal to the relief of the dread mass of snffering in which such multitudes of the tnnocent and the helpless have been involved seems almost to require an apology and scarcely to admit of an excuse. There are, however, duties to be discharged amid all this absorbing ireight of synpathy and sorrow, and In the success of which it is right me sbould rejoice. Such bas been the duty of those by whom our students have been prepared for the services they have EO honourably attained to. Such is the duty we are to-day engaged in, and such is the duty of all In university, academy, or school, who are, or shali be engaged in training thbe youth of our country tO the sevice and honour of the State or the general businss of active life, imbuing their minds with the severer learning, science and knowledge of collegiate studies, or refining and ado:. - ing them by the more ornamental but still honour. able and useful teaching of the fine arts; and then it is, I think, permitted to us more especially to rejoice in the prospect that from our coleges we are able to send forwalrd to the duties of that Indian service, for which too much cannot now be done, men qualified to take their part in it with a sound preparation of requisite knowledge. feel convinced, however, that this struggle must end in the triumph of Britibh arms. But a great enterprise will remain to be undertakenwhen the battling shall cease. The reconstruction of an empire is perhaps now to be before these youthful servants of the Easternx realms ; and w hatever task in this mighty vro2k may he their allotted portion. I believe I may with confidence anticpate that they wil perform tt with advantage to the State and with credit to themselves and to the college from which they have proceeded." The Chancellor having concluded, the degrees, diplomas, and certificates were conferred upon the several candidates by the Lord-Lieutenant. His Excellency subsequently delivered an eloquent address, in the course of which he made special reference to the success of the pupils from the Belfast College, concluding with these marked observations:- I am tempted by the mentionA uf that pisce to remind my young friends now here who come from it that we must look to them as called upon in some measure to redeem as well as to adorn that celebrated and thriving community. It has been very painful to find in these modern times of enlightenment and progreas-I must add, too, in these days of national emergency and sterner pressurea polished city like Belfast disfigured by unseemly exhibitions of religious discord, and, if such a flagrant contradiction in terms may be allowed, of religious hatred. We bave heard, indeed, Belfast occasionally termed the Northern | Athens, and I hope the future career of some whom I now see before me, will do much to justify, to secure, and perpetuate that title. But if we were only to give attention to some of the statemnents we have been lately perusing, the outburst of strife and contention among those who ought to live as brothers would make us think that we were rather reading not so much the annals of Athens as of Thehes. (Applause.) One further reflection touched upon with great feeling by the Vice-Chancellor is suggested by the special sphere of action to which some of your late agsociates are on the point of being called, and whither I hope some more among you will follow them-I mean the civil service of India. (Applause.) Other associations, alas ! are now mingled with that name, besides those of peaceful duties quietly performed and substantial fortunes comforUbly amassed. All who are now sent to that stirring theatre, whateve, may be the precise character of their mission, must be prepared for hardship, for danger, for much patient eadurance, possibly for high. strungcourage; at all events for sustained and strenuous exertion. In the great drama of the Indlan recovery every one must play his allotted part to the top of his bent (applause); and I fervently hope that among the honourable and enduring successes of the Queen's Colleges in Irelod, it may come to he recorded of them that the young men whom they will have trained for the business of active life have borne a conspicuous and distinguished part in the Imperial tasl whlch nowr derolves on us as a people, of restoring upono a firmer, a purer, a noler .a than it ever yet rested on, the hold of civilized and Chrstin England upon the regainedmillionsof India. (pplause.)" The proceedings then terminated. BAs;rXASLOE GREAT FAIR. The correspondent of Sasuders's Newrieiter writes as follows, under date of Ballinsaloe, Saturday Night - " The approach of our grast fair hs been looked forward to with considerable interest on the present ocason. The prices of stock for the last few years have ruled extremely high, and our fairs have been lorgely supplied. It would appear, however, that by the statistcs collected by the legistmr-General there is 4 deficleney throughout the kingdom in some classes of live stock, especially sheep. A falling off is, tberefore, exped in the number of sheep to be offered for sae at our fair on Monday. As a matter of course this wocudoocsioan advance in prices At the neighbouring fair, from whih manyof ourgrazers makeup their lots, sheep brought bigher. prices than usul, and at the fair of Monday and TU a proportonate advance is confidentlyanticipated.

One of the Belfast papers has taken the trouble to eatiraate the expense cd the recent Commission of Inquiry, and the result :is tated to be this .- "-The two commissioners, at five guineas each per day, for 16 sitting days, wil net iG) guineas-16.; a Government reporter, at two guineas per day, 331. 12s., and for say, 25 days in tranYlrbing his 3otes, 52Z 1s.; two counsei (Messrs.

On the town will fall, however, halfthe expense f the additionsl constabular dranghted to Belfast to uppress iets that had no longer an existence, and who aire Xo be billete upeei us, we suppose, until the 12th of July conies round agan." EXTRA&ORDINDAY Fs'UD) ON 'rM cuWOsss A discovery of a rather extensive tea robbery and fraud on the Oustoms, which has jut been brought to light in Belfast) has created no small exciemnent in that mercantile commlunity. The-ansner of Ssaturday gives the following account of the imatter - " Yesterday the commercial Public and general comnunity of this town were started by the discovery of one of the most extensive and systematicslly fraudulent affairs that a.Tve ever occurred in this country. It came to IigAticlearly that a person engaged in the tea trade, undef-the farm of John James Moore and Co,, had been in the habit of replenishing his stock for a considerable period past by an ingenious process slil. fully artful and recklessly Illegal. His coneern was situated in Skipper-street. At the rear of it there are several storehouses in which bonded teas were plaoed. Moote had I$ this concern to the authorities for this purpose. He was unmarried and lived upon the premise; out of his back office a doorway led to the bond store, which is closely adjoining the office. Moore managed to get a key fitted to the lock of the bond store, and by that meanwould effect an entrance whenever he ploased. How he got thi5 key forged and fitted to the lock of tbe store is, as yet, a mystery, and there are a number of other circoumstances in connexion with the occurrence that, for so far, are unexplained, if at all explicable. A slight contemplation of the cool, artful nature of the whole performance is at once suggestive of the great English gold robbery. On Thursday P slight bu= arose in the matter, and the party at zresent principally implicated, against whom we do not Wish to utter a word that might hereafter turn out to be incorrect, talked pretty freely about semething belng wrong 'in a house engaged in the same business as himself.' To others it would appear he was still more com municative, and more than one peraon knew, it is said, all about the affair before the facts of it got abroad. A rumour or private information, to the effect tbat ' a screw was loose' in Skipper-street induced the authorities of the Inland Revenue to send on Tharbday morning officers to examine stack 'I of the bonding warehouse, owned by Messr. Moore and Co., of Skipper-street. Ths examination led immediatelyto the disoovery that an extensive fraud had been praotised, bat by whom was not very dearly apparent; benoe the individual believed moet guity got plent of time to make his arrAngements and effect his escape. The examination was continued and concluded yesterday, the result showing that 732 packages according to one account, and 960 according to another, chiefed chestsworth, including duty, 10,000o. or 12,0001-had been removed from the store, and 'dummies,' or false packages, substituted for them. The covers of the original pckagea had been taken off and placed on the false packages which were substituted. The 'trade,' for such It would seem to be, had been going on for upwards of a year, which accounts for the large number of chests missing and the extent of the property made away with. Yesterday forenoon a formal complaint was made before the magistrates at the police court, aud Mr. C. Runt issued the following warrant:-' From information I have received, I authorizo Detective Hugh 3r'lroy and assistants to proceed to the house and premises of John James Moore and Co., Sktpper-street, and search the same, as well as the bond store attached, to secure all parties vithin the said concern, to be brought before me for examination.' Armed with this auLthority, M'lroy and hPKirtrick, acting with their usual crity, in a short time brought before Mr. Hunt a young men named Andrew Harbison, who had been for. merly employed as a traveller in the house; John Robb, a porter; William Kennedy, a clerk in the concern; and an old housekeeper named Anne M'CIelland. These parties, against whom no accusation was preferred, were examined, with several others at some length. The investigation lasted for several hours. John Robb, we understand, deposed that he had been a porter in the employment of John James Moore for the lut two year A considerable time ago Moore commenced the practice of entering the bond store by means of a false key, and bringing out from three to Eve chests of tea at a time, telli'g witness that he would pay the duty or retura them. He and Moore then packed up empty chests with brickbats, atr;w, and t-urf, and as soon as possible placed them In that pait of the store from which the packages of tea had been taken. The practice had been going on till within the last eight days. Mr. Harbison stated that he knew Moore to brng tea out of the store by means of his false key; and Kennedy, the clerk, stated, with some hesitation, that tea had been brought into the concern, the duty on which he did not know to be paid. Telegraphic despatcheg, at the termination of the investigation, were forwarded to London, Liverpool, and Glasgow, in hopes of arresting Moore at some of these places, and a warrant for his apprehension was issued, in the following terms, by Ylr. Hunt: -' Whereas a complaint has been made on oath and in writing, that John James Moore, late of Skinper. street, in the town and borough of Belfast, tea-merchant, did,j on the 2d day of October, and previous day, feloniously and framdulently take, and carry away a number of chests of tea which were bonded in the bonded store situated in Skipper-street, in the town of Belfast, which store he entered by means of a false key, and did then and there substitate, and place In said store, several fraudulently made-up chests, representing chests of tea, which, on being opened, are found to be filled with briokbats, turf, and straw, against the peace and statute.' This warrant concludes in the usual terms, authorizing the arrest. The witnesses were bound over to prosecute, and all, with the exception of Robb, were enlarged, and he was directed to be detained and kept from all communication with parties who might attempt to tamper with him. The premises in Skipper-street show that an evacnatton of the tenement had been for some time in contrmplation. The stock is very trifling-in fact, worth aimost nothing. There are a number of empty tea chests, b icks, and turf in what wrould appear to have been the room employed in packing the ' dummies,' and several pieces of canvas are lying about. The remainder of the stock of raw material used in the deception proves how fully estblished the fraudulent practice had become on the premises. The occurrence is one of an unparalleled character, at least in the north of Ireland, and has excited the indignation of the entire trade. A subscription was last evenin' set on foot to assist in tracing out the transaction in a0i its ramifications, and that a reward may be offered for all information that may bring all parties concerned to summary justice. The offence is a felony, and will render any one convicted of it liable to 14 years' transportation. The warehouse was secured by a general bond for 3,0001. Government have, we believe, laid their embargo on the remnainder of the stock in the stoze, that the duty may not b, lost to them. It wil amount to up wards of 4,0001. Several gentlemen in the tea tirade will, of course, suffer considerable loss by the robbery, and here we oannot refrain estresiing some surprise that more effective measures have not teen adopted to arrest the person charged as principal In this most extensive and daring fraud. He may be taken by the assistance of telegraphic despatches, btut the chances arc that he wiU avoid bringmng himself into contact with those ficers liely to receive such communications. Moore, we are glad to say, is not a native of the town. He came. here a fewv yean ago as the representative of London, Livenpool, and Glasgowr houses in the tea trade, and "Iinately started in businesson his ownaccounti. The istlgationwill be r.tsumed to-da y at the police-court." The Northern Wthg of the same date supplies sYome additional particulars:- "Since the above vras written we have leant some further particulars with respect to this extrsordinary fraud, We believe that Mr. Harbison entered the smployment of Moore on the 5th of September, 3856, and left it about two months ago. During the period he was connected with the establishment he !sad severel opportunities of observing the character o9 the fraud, and be repeatetUy remonstted with Moorexen the infamous nature of hs conduct.

Mr. Co rovKauid, there yas no doubt but that the' feel. ings and objects ofkth, directs en calling. this-meeting were wholly mnisunderstood, for omn behalf of hineelh and colleagues he challenged and demuanded the strictest inquiry. (Hear.) He denied that the directors had d:7ne anything wrong, they had merely committed an error of judgment. They had been tated shamainlly. they had been charged with everything ;,but still he.snet them with the, greatest self-gratificasion. The directors had been a2sled wrongfully. They had never put theiir hands into the ppckets of any of the shareholders, and therefore they dessrved the support of the sharehelders.. Elbelieved that if they had that support, and the views of t:e. shareholders. wore. met, t9e concern might,y't.bo.made to pay. Be coiud never undewstnd what they had done to iatify the great amount of personal opprobrizux which ha!d been cast upoa them. They ad always endeavoured to do their beet fcr the Gardens, and had always ione. that wbieh vas felt. onsoientiously to be teo- boat for. the- interest cl the shareholders. They had, prepare4 a report for the viidication of their' characters which he s-mId read. Re then read the report, whish stated that- although the directors were not able to comgratulate the sharehoMers upon the pressut conditiots of the company, they were unwilling to abandon the undertaking as hopeless. They believed tha mneans to cacry out the origiLal intant of the company, and to render it both useful and profitable, could be devised. Tieir short exTrience of trs season of 18%6 deceived them, and when It was stated that a singer, who on one night in 185d brought 61l51, in 1SoK,.ouly brought 441., others besides the directors might have been e'jually misled. The igitly reesiptdidlnot meathe expenditure, and the directars made advances and incurred personal liabilities in the hopesof largerrstuns, butwhesstheir own director of music, ML JUllien, was fse firat to :ake hostilo stepe, and instituto.. proceediugs-which would,,haae thrc.wn the entire .prope-y of the coraplay into the hado of hinvel and idB advisers, they saw that to go on a 1 lunger wao imppssible.

FORBIGN IYTELLIGENCE. FRANCE. (FROM OUR OWN CORRPESPONvvv I [A portion of the following appearod in our aecond dition of yeaterdav:-1 FARIS, SUNDAY, OCT. X, 6 P.M. The echoes of Imperial greetings are dying away, and the lively interest attached to the late interviews begins to subside, although their importance, variously estimated, stil remains. If any particular questions have been treated and decided upon at Osborne, Stuittgart, and Weimar, time will show it; at any rate, it may be hoped and believed that this friendly Intercourse and rapprochement among Sovereigns will not be sterile of good fruits, nor fail to contribute to future harmony among the Governments of Europe. To-day's newv that has reference to those meetings may be condensed into a few lines. M. uiibner hb had a long interview with Count Walewski, at which the most friend]y assurances were interchanged with respect to the meeting at Weimar. The arrival in Zaris is announced of an Aide-do-Camp of the Kiing of Prussia, bearing an autograph reply to the letter writtentothatMonarch bytheEmperorNapoleon and sent by the hands of young Murat, who has been promoted by his own Sovereign, and has received from the one to whom he was deputed the cross of Commander of the Order of the Prussian Eagle. Mean- while the Emperor remains at his camp, and there, are complaints in official quarters that his prolonged absence inpedes the progress of business. People here are sick of the very name of the ChOions Camp, so we may imagine what the Imperial Guard must be, now that the days are getting short and the nights cool. There is no appearance, however, of its being raised before the time fixed, although Idare may two or three days of heavy rain might damp the Emperor's military ardour and dissolve the martial assemblage now wearying and grumbling on the banks of the Cheneu. Those Marshals who have not yet visited the camp bave received a special invitation to attend there between the 5th and 9th inst. According to the latest despatches received by the French Government from Hlongkong, the Court of Pekin had returned no reply to the demands for satisfaction addressed to it by M. de Bourboulon, the French Minister In China. At the head of the griefs set forth in these demands is the murder of the Abbc Chapdeline, put to death by the Chinese authorities. There is a talk here of operations being commenced as soon as Baron Gros shall arrive at his post. The Constitutionnel considers one of the most fatal consequences of the Sepoy revolt to be the interruption in India of public works, and especially of railroads, the completion of which would, as it believes, have produced one of those commercial revolutions that often have great political results. The supply of cotton from Behar by means of the railway already corimenced to connect that province with Bombay would, thinks the Oonstitiutiolel, thave emancipated the cotton manufacturers of Europe, and especially of England, from their present dependence on the United States whose chief element of influence in the old world would thus be sensibly diminished, whilst the consequent diminution of American cotton-growing would be a blow to the institution of slavery, and give preponderance to the northern over the southern States. Considering that the Indian revolt will necessarily not only retard the anticipated increase in the cotton export from that country,but diminish in amount the supply it has hitherto afforded, and that the cotton markets and manufactures of England, France, and the continent in general wiU doubtless feel the effect of this-the supply from the States being far from sufficient to satisfy the want- of the world-the ConstitutionneZ looks about for countries where cotton culture may be encouraged and extended. Foremost among these it places Algeria, French Guiana, and the French West Indian Islands. The k;overnment has already held out great encouragement to the production of cotton in Algeria, but as yet without any great result. This is partly attributed to cotton-growing being an indolent occupation, well suited to negroes, but uncongenial to the activity and superior intelligence of the French settlers in Africa, as also to the restlesr, roving habits, of the Arabs. The recent conquest of Kabylia will, it is thought, afford precious sourcea to the Algerine cotton planter, who will find cheap and abundant labour among its numerous laborious and sedentary population. But it is chiefly upon the west, upon the French Antilles and Guiana, that the Constitution0el reckons for an increased supply of cotton. The hope may appear rather over-sanguine when we learn that the utmost quantity as yet produced in a year by the combined plantations of Martinique, Guadeloupe, and Guiana is l,SOO,000 kilogrammes, while France alone annuaUy consumes nearly 40,000,000. Cotton, however, has been much neglected in those colonies, where r,ugargrowing is preferred, as more lucrative. The two are quite compatible, since a different claos of soil and of labour is required for each. Arms too feeble to toil among the sugar canes can beusefully employed inthe cotton plantations. Understanding this, the French Government has endeavoured to stimulate the production of cotton by abolishing the duty upon its import into France, and by offering premiums for its cultivation. Thus, in Guadeloupe every inhabitant who plants 50 ares of land with cotton is exonerated for five years from certain taxes. There and in Guiana the Colonial Government supplies the planters with mills, and in the latter colony with seed of the best description; and latterly the French Government has adopted, with respect to those colonies, the same plan that had been already applied to Algeria-that of authorizing the local authorities to purchase, at a remunerative price, the whole crop of cotton of superior quality. This is afterwards to be sold in France, and the colonial freasuries -will pay the difference, if any, between thes price of purchase and that of sale. A parcel of cotton from Guadeloupe, puirchased in this way, will shortly be offered in one of the French markets. 'By these measures of encouragement it is hoped that France may become more self-supplying in respect of cotton than she has hitherto been; and, although she cannot hope ever to obtain from her own possessions a quantity sufficient for her consumption, the quality of her West Indian produce its said to be particularly well adapted to some of her delicate and tasteful manufactures. The Uniorn, apparently In an extremely bad humour, has a violent and abusive article on English misgovernment in India. The rule of the Company, whose sole object has been to extract from the Indians their substance and their toil, is denounced as contrary to civilization, and it is declared immoral to desire the duration of such a conquest. The Union says that it has already brought forward this question under another form, and "the democracy has not replied." Perhaps this is the secret of the IUnion's il temper. People will not take the trouble to reply to it; so it quotes Tacittes in justification of the Sepoy revolt, and in condemnation of English tyranny. Of all nations, it says, that which least succeeds in assimilating and obtaining the sympathy of others is the English, and it cites as an example Canada, " where French manners and even French laws have remained inveterate, under an organization which, during a century's existence, has been only able to make itself hated, without knowing how to get itself pardoned." I am tempted to quota some longer passages notable for their rabid folly, but the effusions of the Union can be considered to represent the views of such an extremely small number of persons in France besddee their writers that. such an mtrusion on your space would hardly be justified. The Union should try to be as amusing as it is malignant; otherwixe, as its opinons are really not of the slightest consequence, it can hardly hope to obtain the notice of that "dempcracy" under whose mute contempt it evidently painfully writhes. Asmailant there are not even worth whipcord. Our old friend the Assemblee Nationale, tolerably well-behaved for some time, after being permitted to re-appear as the 4sectateur, but which now again begins to snarl, comes under this head. It sneers at the grant of some Orimean guns to an English town, and deems such distributions highly out of saon, when each arrival from india brings tidinegs of mourning and consternation. Spealing of the Miauritius-its cry of alarm ab to whose unpro tected state it wronders should havre found no echo in- the French press-it says that the whole world knows that island as the "Isle of Franes," but that it does not grudge to the English the puerile satisfaction of effacing, when fortune favours them, names that history has consecrated. If .history were rather more familiar to the speeatcur, that hypercritical journal would not require to be told that the island of Mauritius, so called by its Dutch possessors after Maurice, ince of Orange, bore that namue before the Frenc!s ever held it, and for a longer period than it aver Tmonged to them. The Congress for the definitive organ1ztiWn of the Danubian Principalities is expected to meet In Paris early in the month of November. It ia reported that no very long time will elapae before the convocation of the Corps Legislatif. Its President, Count de Morny, Is at present at his country-house, in the department of the Alier. There will have been coined at the Paris Mint in the year 1857 not less than 600,000,000f. in gold. According to a telegraphic despatch received here, the Austrian corps whose evacuation of the Roman States was lately announced marched from Bologna on the day appointed, the 30th September. Its departure will be an important diminution of the expenses of the Papal Government. Mademoiselle Rachel is reported to be rather better, but there can be no hope of her ultimate recovery. The following private telegraphic despatches have been received:- " MARSEILLES, OCT. 4. "The Emperor will probably come to Marseilles between the I1ith and 20th October, to examine several projects re]ting to the port and roadstead, to the establshment of docks and graving-docks, which would bethe consequence of the cutting of the Isthmus of Suez, the construction of the Imperial palace, that of the barracks, of the supply of manufacture of tobacco; and, finally, the prolongation of the Can6bl6re, the enlargement of the street, of Aix, and the cleansing of the old town." "MADRmD, Ocr. 3. "A Royal order declares that the pensions granted for the events of July are to be continued." A letter from Lyons announces the arrest in that city of a retired grocer, now a wealthy landed proprietor, who has been for some time suspected of forging bank-notes. The police succeeded in laying their hands on a complete apparatus for forging notes in imitation of those of the Bank of France for SOOf. each. The forged notes seized amount to the sum of 500,0001. The appeal of Captain Doineau, condemned to death by the Imperial Court of Oran for having planned the assassination of Abdallals Aga, travelling in a stagecoach between Tlemcen andOn, was argued before the Court of Cassation in Paris on Friday by M.

The Court delivered judgment last evening, and rejected the appeaL That of the Arabs who committed the murder, and who were found guilty with extenuating circumstances, was likewise rejected.

It is totally imposible to get a correct idea of the physiognomy of a town, or of the habits of a population, if one visits it on such very unusual occasions as that which has brought me hither. In the few days I1 have been here the main features of the pasengers in the streets, in which, of course, the strangers at the moment staying here form the most conspicuous feature, have altered four times completely. At first was to be seen nothing but black coats and white cravats, men of retirement and study; then dashing ofiicers and well-dressed diplomatists, men of the world and of action; then pale-faced but bright-eyed artists, men of poetry and imagination; and, last of all, the stalwart frames and sunburt faces of the peasantry-men versed only in the simplest realities of this mundane life. The sellers of prints and books, too, have been obliged during this period to tax the very superficial capacities of their shop windows to the utmost to gain space for the rapidly varying exhibition of those subjects interesting at the moment. Luther, Melancthon, and all the worthies of the Reformation have been arrogantly jostled from their places by the portraits of the Russian and French Imperial couples and those of the Wurtemberg Royal family, as they again have given place to the notabilities of art, science, and literature, which I take to be the normal manifestation of Stuttgart tastes. The population of Stuttgart is generally reckoned to be under 60,000, but there must on Sunday evening last have been fully 80,000 persons within its precincts; for, in addition to the theologians \vho remained over from the Kirchetag, there were the suites of the two Emperors (the Emperor Alexander's was 80 odd, that of Louis Napoleon 70 odd), and the other great folks here, the artists from all parts of Germany, the peasants from all parts of Yurtemberg for the Vol:s Jest on Monday, and the men of the rifie, who had streamed in by ahoals from the mountainous country around for the approaching &huttzenfcst. Another numerous body not mentioned above was that of the French police agents, who swarmed all over the streets and invaded every hotel and table dh6te. These were organized for the most part into smaller bands, imder the leadership of some Stuttgarter of French sympathies (generaUly men who had served under Napoleon I.), and acquainted with the two languages as well as the localities of Stuttgart. Their zeal succeeded in procuring from the local police that an Italian family which had put up at a thirdrate hotel was packed off from Stuttgart and the kingdom of Wurtemberg, as also tlaat two Italians, one of them disguised as a woman, were arrested here on getting out of the railway train. The telegraph from Ulm had given intelligence of these auspicious individuals, and their stay in Stuttaart was confined to the time that was necemary for the train, which had rmn into the station, to be backed out again. A good deal of stress hasbeen laid on the fact that at the French Emperor's arrival a cry of " Vive i'Em,percur I" was set up in different parts of the crowd; but the circumstance is clearly traceable to these swarms of French police agenta, who were almost numerous enough to effeet a coup d'6tat in this little place. It has even been stated that the whole troupe of French actors and actresses was also in the service of the police; if so, it is to be hoped that they performed better services as such than they did as votaries of Thalia and Polyhymnia, for their talent as actors and singers was very mediocre indeed. This town recommends itself to the notice of those desiring to pass a summer in Germany by the beauty of the surrounding country (every street you look up presents a fresh view of a different vine-covered mountain), the salubrity of the air, the moderate cost and the easiness of livinghere,itspropinquityto bothEngland and France, and particularly Switzerland, which can be reached in a few hours. In the immediate neighbourhood, too, there are adrmirable mineral waters, and establishments for taking them either internally or externally, and everything else requisite to make a summer's stay agreeable. Those who repair to an hotel cannot do better than follow the recommendation of the infallible Murray, and stop at Marquardt's, where the treatment is good and the charges moderate, even at this conjunction of so much Royalty being concentrated here, when the public has been totally at the mercy of landlords. His house, moreover, presents one very great attraction to Englishmen, though not mentioned in dVturray,-viz., the ironwork of the balcony is made out of the i'on cage in which the body of a former Finance Minister of Wurtemberg-the notorious Jew, Sas Oppenheim-was kept confined till it dropped to pieces, after being hung by the populace in 1738. The contrivance of the iron cage was resorted to to prevent the body being taken down from the gallows and stolen by the Jews which would have in a certain measure defeated the object of hanging him,-viz., that of making him a lasting example pour decourager les autres. At that time the doctrine of Ministerial responsibility was better understood than it is now. During the first days of the Emperor Louis Napoleon's stay in Stuttgart he was always accompanied by a military escort, which the Emperor Alexander was not, and when he drove toWilhelma on Saturday afternoon, accompanied by the Kinfg, two officers, in addition to a guard of about a dozen men, rode at the side of the earriage. Subsequently he dispensed with all escort, and walked and drove out among the people with no other retinue than one Wurtemberg officer, appointed to wait on him during his stay here. At a former period of his life Louis Napoleon, or, as he was then called, Napoleon Louis, lived in Stuttgart as a political refugee, and it was there that he published many of* his anony*mou.s works. Even as far back as that he was a great favou±lte&with the present King, who screened him fr6m the persecution of Louis Philippe, and refuseed to expel him over the frontier. WETMhaR, OcT. The Emperor and Emprels of Russia, Pijrlce Alexander of Hemse, and Prince Gortakhakoff arrived here yesterda' 3 9g at 9 o'clock from Darm- stadt, accompanied ie, L.o Grand Duke and Duehess of Weimar, who hadgone out to meet them as far as the Wartburg, where they had all dined together. Thence the entire party drove to Belvedere, the country seat of the Dowager Grand Ducheso of Wei- mar, an aunt of the Emperor of Russia, where they were received by her, the Dowager Queen of the Netherlands, another aunt of the Emperor's, and Duke Bernhard of Saxe Weimar, the uncle of the present Grand Duke. This morning, at 9 o'clock, the Emperor of Austria arrived here from Dresden, accompanied by the Grand Duke of Weimar, who had gone to meet him at the frontier station, and attended by General Count von Griinne, the Austrian Minister at Drosden, and two Adjutants. He was received at the railway station by Duke Bernhard of Saxe Weimar, Prince Alexander of Hesse, General Count Clam, the Governor-General of Bohemia, and a numerous staff of Austrian and Weimar officers. The guard of honour presented, and theband played the Austrian national hymn; and, after but few preliminaries, the Emperor drove off to the town, accompanied bythe GrandDuke, and followed byCount Gr-anne with Duke Bernhard. Almost immediately after, having been introduced to the Grand Duchess, and having had the various officers of the household presented to him, the Emperor drove off in the same carriage that had brought him from the railway, an open barouch with six cream-coloured horws, to pay his visit to the Dowager Grand Ducheas and her gests, the Emperor and Empress of Russia. The EImperor Francis Joseph had for the occasion assumed the uniform of his Russian regiment, and the blue riband of the St. Andrew Order. On the arrival of the Emperor Francis Joseph at Belvedere the Dowager Grand Duchess came to meet him on the steps leading up to the house, led by the Emperor of Russia; on which the two Emperors embraced and kissed each other. After they had each of them presented their retinue to the other, the two Emperors retired into a room apart, and conversed for some time alone; they then drove back into the town, stiU alone, and without a single attendant, the Emperor of Russia seated on the right, which is by no moans his customary seat when he is free to choose. To judge by the expression of the countenances of the two young Emperors, who by-the-by were both looking in very good health and spirits, matters must be going smoother and more rapidly here than they did at Stuttgart. Shortly afterwards the Emperor of Russia returned to Belvedere, and then went out shooting. The Emperor of Austria, on the other hand, went on foot to pay a visit to Duke Bernhard at the FiGrstenhaus, and then took a drive with the Grand Duke, who himself drove. This meeting of the two Emperors of Russia and Austria in this town has a precedent in the meeting of the Emperor Alexander I. with the Emperor Francis II. after the battle of Leipsic in 1813, when they met at the head-quarters of the alied army under Prince Schwartzenburg. The dinner at the Palace consisted of about 140 persons, many of whom were visitors from the neighbouring Courts. This evening there was, as unsal on these occasions, a gala opera, for which all the great world of Weimar and the neighbouring towns and principalities have been struggling for some days past to get tickets. It was the same seene over again that I lately described to you at Stuttgart, only on a smaller scale, and with a less extent of courtly pretension, and was only in a very small degree to be called splendid. The house, smnall as it is, was too large to be occupied by the Court only, and even the first tier of boxes contained a number of persons not attached to the Court, and not even in fall dress. The Empress of Russia sat in the centre, with the Dowager Queen of Hollanid and the Dowager Grand Duchess of Weimar, her husband's aunts, on either hand, one of whom was flanked on the right by the Emperor of Austria and the Graud Duke of Weimar; and the other on the left by the Emperor of Russia, the Grand Duchess of Welmar, and Prince Alexander of Hesme. There was nothing of that beauty of toilet and splendour of ornament that was visible at Stuttgart; but, on the other hand, there was a total absence of that restraint on the part of the Russian Imperial couple which was evident at Stuttgart in the presence of Louis Napoleon. We had the renowned Liszt to conduct, and the much-talked-of opera by Richard Wagner, TannhUiuser, to listen to. The great folks bore this for two acts, probably on account of their curiosity to hear this dawn of a new school of music and to see the very splendid mannerl in which it has been put on the stage. The storf of the eontest of the singers on the Wartburg being one of historical and local interest to this Grand Duchy, the opera has nowhere been treated so well as here. Nevertheless, no amount of care and splendour in the getting up can save such a production as a dramatic composition, constructed on the principle of anti-climax, like an inverted pyramid, with the apex of interest vested in the beginning, and languishing rapidly into insipidity as it proceeds. As a musical work, possessing stray claims to admiration by sporadic passages of beauty, but on the whole a wild screaming jumble of inharmonious instrumentation, snatches of melody that never amount to a tune, and a constantly recurring succession of forced modulations, interrupted cadences, diminished sevenths, and fearfully impressive passages for the whole orchestra in unison, all about nothing,-it may be true that this is the music of the future, but the more remote we calculate that future the more correct will be our judgment; and it may also b3 true, as Wagner's admirers say, that this music will be heard with delight when that of Mozart and Beethoven is forgotten, but it certainly will not ba before. OCroBEP 2. On leaving the theatre last night the great folks proceeded to Belvedere to supper, and enjoyed on the way thither the spectacle of the rather pretty scenery they passed through, lit up by the fitful light of numerous torches burning with a red fiame (rather a favourite accessory inWagner's Tamlhinser, by-the-by), carried by the outriders and mounted attendants. The two Emperors have left this morning by separate trains-theEmperorFrancisJosephfor lschl by way of Dresden, and the Emperor of Russia also for Dresden, to pay his promised visit to the King of Saxony. It turns out now that there never was any ground for expecting the King of Saxony here, who has plenty to do at home just now with his manceuvres, has nothing to do here, had just had the visit of Francis Joseph, and was about to have that of Alexander. The Empress was to have followed at a later hour, and joined the Emperor at some railway station between Dresden and Berlin, where they are due to-morrow. Their little daughter Olga has, however, fallen ill, though not seriously, I believe, and the }Empress remains here for the present, and the Emperor will return hither in the evening. Their further movements will depend on the health of their child. As regards the results of this meeting of the two Emperors of Russia and Austria, I am led to conclude that if the object of the meeting was simply to remove the acerbities left by the late war by means of personal intercourse, that object has been attained, and a very amicable personal. feeling established; on the other hand, I hear nothing which suggests the idea that any diplomatic basiness at all was transacted. How it has fared witi the fate of Count Buol I am not in a position to report: my own unpression is that Francis Joseph iS niot likeiy~ | to give up his Minister for any but a very weighty reason, and that Alexander is not,as yet, so far "master of the situation"' as to be able t;o demand it, nor Austria so far isolated as to mke it imperative for her to pay that price for readmission to amity with Russia. AUSTRIA. (moM Ovn OWN CoBEzsr-PoNDzliT) YLEN.NA, O0r 2. The French and Rusian diplomatists agree in thinking that the meeting of the two EmTperors at Stulttgart is not likely 'to lead to any gr.eat intimlacy between them. An inhabitant of Stuttg,art, s: must be well aware of what pased in that cic~y during the brief sojourn of the two foreign potentates, says that the impression produced on those persons who had an opportunity of seeing thes Emperors NEapoleon and Alexander togesher wrasi that both of them were playing a part 'Yhich * osI not to their taste." .The correpnwne -'hen ro ceeds to say, that the sudden, and 1.^ - 4 th.e Monarchs unextpected, appearnco of 1 'ress of Russia produced a dfr*g sable *. ioi as it was felt by all ' -dat after whia had passed in regard to the Empress Eugenie her iRussian Majest ought not to have paid a visit to the C.urt of Wurtemberg while the Emperor of the French was there." In such a mall capital as Steuttgart almost all the inhabitants are known to each other by sht, and it is therefore imposaible to doubt the correctness of the statement adet by several of the thth ththe fewr persons ho cheered the Emperor of the French on his arrival wiere foreigners. The a oran Meour, a aemi-offhcial paper, says that a "1 dead silence ' (lautlose stiUe) prevailed as the French Monarch drove to the Palace. The King of Wurtemberg is accustomed to walk through the streets of his capital alone, and the honest Swabians were therefore greatly astonished to see the close carriage in which the French Monarch sat accompanied by a guard. Several French police agents were in Stuttgart while the Emperor Napoleon was there, and they received permission from the local authorities to arrest any person or persons wlhom they might suspect of harbouringan intent to do mischief. The illy swvaggering of the Paris papers has rouased the spirit of the Germans, and the language of the press is calculated to impress Count Walewski with the idea that all the German States would enter a protest against an aliance between France and Russia. For the first time since tho year 1840, when M. Thiers talked about crossiDg the Rhine, there is unity of purpose in Germany. The Neue P1reussische Zeitug, which is notorious for its bias in favour of Russia, declares that it is resolved to asFiSt in maintaining the rights of Germany, and the other influential Prussian papers use exactly the same language. The Austrian papers join in the cry which is raised against France, and on the 30th September-the day on which the Emperor and Empress of Russia arrived at Weimar-the official organ of the Grand Ducal Government expressed itself to the effect that the meeting of the Emperors of Austria and Russia might be considered as a guarantee that harmony was restored between the great Powers. "When a good understanding pre- vailsbetweenallthePowers," saysthe Weinar aazette,I II it is much less likely that the peace of Europe will be disturbed, and that powerful States wil endeavour to aggrandize themselves at the expense of their weaker neighbours, than when separate alliances are concluded between them." When the Emperors! Napoleon and Alexander met they simply shook hands, but the Viennese attach importance to the fact that the kiss of peace was exchanged between the latter and the Emperor of Austria. The Wiener Zeitung of this morning thus announces the circumstance to the public:- "WEIMAr, OcT. 1, ATrNooN. *When Bis Imperial Royal Apostolic Majesty went to the Belvedere to call on the Emperor Alexander, the latter went to meet his illustrious visitor on the stairs. Their Majesties embraced and kissed each other in the most friendly way. After having conferred alone for some time they drove back to the city together." According to private advices from St. Petersburg, the organs of the Russian press have received orders to discontinue their attacks on this empire, and instructions have been given to the Austrian papers to refrain from inserting anything in their columns which could give umbrage to Russia. Some weeks since mention was made in my correspondence of the disappointment of the Pope at not receiving a visit from the Emperor when he (the Pope) was so close to the Austriau frontiers, and I now know why the openly expressed wish of his Holiness was not gratified. The Pope claims a right of precedence over all other monarehs, and when the Emperor's visit to his Holiness was mooted the Austrian Government was given to understand that on all occasions His Bajesty would have to give the place of honour to the head of the church. The reply was, that if the Sovereign Pontiff should ever come to the Austrian Court he would have the place of honour, and that the same privilege must be granted to the Emperor at the Papal Court. The Roman Government positively refused to yield, and when the negotiations were broken off the Governor-General of the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom was sent to pay a visit of ceremony to His Holiness. The three Russian sloops which some 10 or 14 days since arrived at Constantinople are gone to blockade the Circassian coast. Two Russian gunboats, of the dimensions mentioned in the Treaty of March, have also passed through the Bosphorus on their way to the mouths of the Danube. The following fact is related for the benefit of the masters of vessels trading to Galatz :-About 18 months since an English vessel arrived off the Sulina mouth of the Danube just as it beg-an to blow hard. Al the pilots declared that the ship could not be got over the bar, although a vessel drawing more water, which belonged to the Austrian Lloyd's, had been taken over it just before. My informant gave me to understand that, if any French or English company should resolve on navigating the Danube, it must have its own pilots at the mouth of the river. The Festh Lloyd has received a letter of the 24th August from Mekhiamia Sebik, the head-quarters of Sefer Bey, the Comm ander-inChief of the Circassians. On the 3d of September a " General Circassian Diet" was to be held on the plain of Dagaj, near the river Sehepsch. The Circassians, having succeeded in getting their crops of bay and corn into the mountains, have also retired there, leaving the Russians in the low countries, where they are exposed to the begfever, which carries offthousands of them every year. The writer of the letter, who is a Hungarian, asserts that the troops under his commnd have been reinforced by about 150 deserters, Poles, Kazan and Crimean Tartars, and Russians. Towards the end of the month of August you were informed that the Russians had desecrated the graves of the British and French soldiers who fell in tho Crimea, and we now learn that the Emperor Alexander has sent Prince Galitzin, one of his adjutants, to examine into the matter. Some time ago a very large sum, more than 40,0001., was subscribed for the establishment of a commercial academy in Vienna, but the whole affair is likely to fall to the ground because the Minister for Ecclesiastical Affairs insists on appointing a Catholic director and professors. The principal subscribers were Jews and Protestants, and, as they made it a condition sine qu4 mno that Jews and Protestants should enjoy the same privileges as Catholics, they are about to withdraw their subscriptions. Whenever the Austrians attempt to do anything they invariably feel the Concordat galling their withers. The following is a summary of the balance sheet of the Bank for the month of September:-The metallic reserve is 96,150,301fl., and the nominal value of the bank-notes in eirculation S99,705,128fl. The bill portfolio is 90,632,722fl., and the sum advanced on Government stock 88,500,000fl. In the month of August the stock of specie was 95,175,391fl, and the bank-notes in circulation 395,428,062fl. The &usterreischce OorrcspondenWz yesterday contained a short article, contradicting the various reports relative to the projected financial measures, which was so clumsily written that it caused a complete panic on 'Change. Prince Richard Metternich telegraphs from Weimar that the two Emperors were evidently much moved when they embraced each other. The Constantinople news of the 26th of September is as follows :-" Prince de Joinville is in the Turkish capital, with the Princess his wife. Issan Bey, the new Minister at the Prussian Court, has gone by way of Galatz to Berlin. Mehemet Ali Pasha has been appointed MIinister, writhout portfolio." TURKEY. (FROM Oix O OWwN COESrPONDMM) CONSTANTINOPLE, SEPT. 26. There can be no better evidence of a weak Govern- ment than frequent changes in the Administration. In Turkey scarcely has a Ministry been formed than its overthrow can be predicted with certainty at no remote period; six months is a long tenure of office; few men can spin out so long their lease of power unless they are of the Imperial family, when their permanence in office becomes a matter of course. There is no trace of principle, no followed purpose in a Turkish Cabinet. There are no political parties based on a common belief in any fundamental political principle. When it i* said that such a Pasha is of that or that party, to which one of the European Powers lends its name, it does not mean that he understands and prefers the policy of that nower in the East, and uses his influence to support A. ThePashaisquite hxthe dark on such mattera, and cares very little about them; he is cunning and ele er, and may persuade an unwary Ambassador sh '~ he favours his views, but in reality he merely seeks his private Interest, and hopes the goodwrill of the E31chi w/ill secure fBor him a good berth at the coming Minlsterial change. Indeed, it would require far greater penetration than a Pasha or any one else possesses to discover what is really the polcyand intention of thevarious Powers the representatives of which battle for influence at StambouL I leave Russia aside; her aim became sufficiently clear from the cireumstances which produced the last war; it will not be abandoned, although for a time its pursuit may be less active. But Prussia, Austria, France, England, have they any definite views, any well-ordered system which they are strIving to carry out t Is it different ideas and opposite interests which every now and again come into collision and produce complications dangerous to the pesce of Europe ? A very slight glance at the history of the last 30 ,ears will prove the contrary. The urkish queetion only comes to the surface every now and then, when for a short time it becomes foremost in the preoceupation of statesmen; but the crisis over, and by mutual consent it is dropped; everyone is glad to have done with a troublesome and ungrateful subject, and nothing more is heard of it till some new complication brings it up again. There is one point, however, which is not lost sight of, but it is of local more than general interest. All the Powers agree in considering as a conceded right that their representative at the Porte shaU enjoy a certain influence in the councils of the Empire. The degree of this influence, the objects it shall be applied to, are undefined; but it must exist-it is a necessary consequence of the friondly alliance existing between the Sultan and the King or Emperor-on it depends the diplomatic reputation of the ambassador. But every ambassador does not require influence for the same purpose; each has his own specialty, which the Turks well know, and they humour him aecordingly, but they would be takeu aback if he came to want anything out of what is his proper line. Thus Prussia, a nation of drill sergeants, has long had the privilege of drilling Turkish recruits; the Prussian Minister, if he could always get his protSggs admitted as instructors for the army, would require nothing else. Austria has been content with influence in another equally modest sphere. She has the monopoly of supplying profe-sors to the Military Medical Academy; the internuncio imports them from Vienna as they are required; this is her way of assisting the " sick man." Prussian and Austrian representatives are frequently changed; there uever has been among them any diplomatist of marked superiority; they seldom have interfered with the internal polity of the empire beyond what was necessary for the defence of the immediate interests of their subjects; in general they seem to take but little interest in the country and imagine nothing to promote its welfare. The r6le of British representatives in the East has always been far more important. Parliament or Ministers at home have not in general given more time to Turkish affairs than they could help, but our Ambassadors seem to have always been attentive to the destiny of Turkey and anxious for the development of its resources. Whether accident or design, they have generally been men distingished for their superior talents,and having always remained a very long time at their post they have necessarily become famillar with the country and its requirements. They seem to have takenat heart its interests, whether by protecting the oppressed classes, drawing the attention of the central government to the tyranny and exactions of distant governors, or pointing out plans of administrative or social improvement. From their knowledge of the country and of events taking place at its most remote corners, knowledge often, especially in a few years, far more accarate than that of the Government itself, they have commanded the attention of every succeseive M-inistry. Here alone there has been any evidence of desiga or policy, and this is the reason why the only Turkish Ministry which also has a principle and a policy, that of Redschid, has so constantly received the support in this quarter. Remove Redschid from power, and aU definite plan of government disappears. France has not a more definite policy in Turkey than Austria or Prussia. Her representatives have always been remarkable for their ignorance of the men and country, they have never remained long enough to acquire much information, and, besides, Frenchmen have peculiar difficulty in making themselves at home in a foreign country; they also require influence, but, having no object of their own to attain, their plan has been to oppose anything, however trifling, originating elsewhere. They seem aU to have heard, before leaving France, that ambassadors may acquire great influence in the councils of the Stiltan, and from the day of their arTival they set about to secure this; but influence without an object to gain by it is nothing, it lacks the ailment which keeps it up; it results in a meddlesome and mischievous spirit, interfering without reason at every time and every place; it is the source of aU difliculty. It is far wiser to be led than to attempt to lead when the qualities which make a leader are wanting. Such have been the state of Constantinople and the relations of the several Powers to the Government for many years, and such it is likely to be as long as the power is in the hands of a weak and incapable monarch. When at a lucid moment under favouring circumstances a useftul measure is adopted, as the last hatihumayoum, it remains a dead letter from the indisposition to enforce It. To obtain any permanent good from such measures it is not merely necessary to devise them, but also to keep an everyday watch on their faithful execution. THE BALTIC. (FROM OUR OWN CORRWsPO?E-DENT.) HAMBURG, Ocr. 3. We learn from St. Petersburg, rid Lubeck, on the ist inst., that a very awful catastrophe happened to a Russian line-of-battle ship between the 21st and 23d ult. in the Gulf of Finland, during a violent storm, in which it foundered, with a crew of upwards of 1,000 souls on board, all of whom perishf.d. About 150 were family men, which renders the misfortune stiU more calamitous. The vessel had arrived near the island of Hogland, from Revel, and her dangerous situation was apparent to t:he crews of several large vessels of war in its vicinity, but, unfortunately, they were not able to render any assistance. The opening of the Danish Diet, which took place in Copenhagen on the 30th ult. by commission, was effected without much noise or bustle. After the ceremony had taken place, and the Royal rescript been read by the Minister of the Interior, declaring the Parliament opened, the members of the two Chambers, or "Things," proceecded to elect the Presidtnts and Vice-Presidents, which was accordingly done before the Assembly broke up. The memorial of the Holstein Provincial Diet relative to the rejection of the constitutional project laid before it by the Danish Government has been published in the shape of an address to His Majesty the King. During the past nine months 3,S45 ships of all descriptions have left, and 3,963 arrived at this port, of which 881 of the former were steamers and the remainder sailing vessels, and of the latter 960 were steamers and 3,003 sailing ships. The number of 938 colliers proves that the coal trade has been in a flourishing condition. SPAIN. Letters from Madrid of the 30th ult. state that it is expected a violent attack will be made on the Ministry at the opening of the Cortes, on occasion of the election of the President and officers of the Chamber of Deputies.

Thns Nagpore means the ToWn of Serpents-a definition, by the way, sufficiently appropriate when we reflect on the treacherous character of the Sepoys by whom it was so reoently ga-risoned. " babd" and " patam" also signify town; Hyderabad being Hyder's Town,and Seringapatam-from Sreringa, a name of a god Vishuro-being the town of Srerluga. Allahabad, from "AUah," God, and " abad," abode, means the Abode of God; that city being the capital of Agra, the chief school of the Brahmins, and much rsorted to by pilgrims. Pan jab is the country of the Five Rivers, *nd Doab is applied o a part of a country between twvo rivers,
TO THE EDITOB OF THE TIMES. ISir,-I yesterday received Thc Time of the 30h ult., con I taining an exceUent artiole on the future organi2ation of a native or other auxiliary for"e for service in India. It appearn to me to take a calm and very comprehensive view of the question, and to embrace fully the various considerations to be borne in mind in discussing it. As you very plainly point ont, the whole gist of the inqnlry lies-first, in our necessities for such a foroo; and next, in the character of that force, as best calonlated to meet those neceas dties. We must first ascertain what the real wants of the country are for her efficient internal government, in the security of life and property, and for her effectual protec. tion against foreiga aggresdon, and thon determine upon the means bost calculated to fully supply these wants. In that article you have done me the honour to allude to the opinions expressed by me on this subject in the several letters which have been favoured with a place in your columns nuder my signature. And, while it is admitted that up to a certain point the argument I have used is unanswerable, you add that the inquiry extends beyond that point, aud involves other and serious obligations. ThAse obligations are fully and plainly stted by you, aud are derorving of the most careful and serious consideration with reference to the question under discussion, because it is upon the existence or non-existence of thesc that the inquiry mainly hinges The first point named by you is that both in the native States and in our own there are " at all times the materials of social and even political disturbances ;" and the Nizam's dominions are specially pointed to as containing a population made up of a variety of dangerous elements, leading to constant caUs upon the military force for the preservation of order. To this I reply that, like every other country, India is doubtless exposed to social disturbances, but I firmly believe that she is far less exposed to political disturbances than any other portion of onr dominions. Ia fact, those very csuses of social disturbance-namely, her various and conflicting castes and races-form the strongest security against all political movements or plots, and certainly against any such of an extensive or dangerous character. And, as far as my recollection serves me, the disturbances which, as you very truly say, every few months break oat in the Nizam's dominions have been entirely, or nearly so, confined to the mercenary troops in his Highnesw's employ. If we look back we shaU find that mutinies and disaffection among the Rohilla or Arab levies composing part of the Nizam's armuy have been the great, if not the sole disturbing element in his territories. The population generally, as in aU other parts of India, are peaceably and quietly disposed. The armed men there, as now, alas, with ourselves, have ever proved the dangerous element of insecurity, and it was one portion of the military force of the Nizam that was so frequently called out to reduce to order, not the insurrectionary population, but, as in our own case now, some other portion of that very force, The next point referred to is the Santhal rebellionThis I consider a very exceptional case, because there exist bat few such tribes of aboriginal savages in our dominions, and where they do exist they are very insignificant and perfectly powerless for evil of a grave character; and when any such outbreak does take place we must look to the European arm to subdue it. Perturbations in the adminAs. trative system such as you refer to may occasionally take place, but what are they compared to the present terrible volcano, and generated by ourselves in a measure ? Can any such perturbations as the exploit of the Moplas, against whom, by-the-by, the Sepoy proved useless; a Zemindar holding out against authority in a mad fort,-a thing never heard of now; or a leader of banditti shooting a coUector, call for an organized nativo army ? Surely we can deal with all such events very well without this most expensive infernal macbine, and more especially so seeing that this machine explodes most effectually against those who have constructed it. Such social disturbances as those alluded to must, of course, be instantly quelled whenever they occur, and means can no doubt be easily devised to secure this far better without than with a native Sepoy army composed of the conquered race, and having too many sympathies with the authors of such disturbances. The next point referred to was the necessity of a native force to defend our north-west and eastern frontiers. These were not overlooked by me, but they cannot weigh against the overwhelming objections to our ever again creating a monster which at any time may tarn upon and rend those whom It Is intended to protect and defend. Neither on the north--rest nor on our Burmese frontier is there any army worth a moment's con. sdderation. One European regiment near enough will offer greater seourity against any indignity or aggression than 20 Sepoy regiments, after what has nowr happened, As to 20,000 wild horsemen crossing the Indus on a raid into our territories, I know not whence the horses are to spring ; but, if such were to appear, it would only be to court destruction. We must mnaintain strong European garrisons on the Indus and the Irrawaddy and at other points of our empire; but I believe that, once this mutiny is suppressed, the whole of the vaUey of the Ganges and Bengal Proper will be as effectually controlled and as peacefully governed, with the same amount of European force as hitherto, without our native army as it has been with it. I ask any man acquainted with India to say where the elements of insurrection are to be found among the population of those provinces ? Who are to rise ? Who are to provide arms, ammunition, and the other material of an effective popular revolt? Where are the arms to come from?? Where are the funds to be found to sustain a rebellion ? We have only to look at the population now stimulated as they are to insurrection by every possible inducement to be satisfied that we have indeed but little to fear on that score. It may be desirable to disarm the Mahomedan population generally to render matters more certainly secure, but even without this my experience of the country forces me to the con. viction that India possesses fewer elements of serious insur. rection-for the present mutiny Is not such-than eTen England herself. As to the vast police force proposed by your able correspondent "Indophilus," if armed and disciplined, this would, as you say, be only another Sepoy army,-a sort of hybrid animal, half soldier and half policeman, and spoilt for both. They would be worthless for external defence, and yet 6qually open to seditious tampering and equally explosive for evil as the late Bengal army, with the one exception of not having the same confidence in their own strength. Let it be clearly shown for what such nn Immense force is required, and, if absolutely necessary, let it be composed of races alien to Hindostan. For my own part, I consider it unnecessary. It is not the want of strength in our existing police, but their gross inefficiencyfor their work, that we have to complain of; and when we remember that it has been a daily thing for ladies with chUdren wholly unprotected to travel in a palanquin both night and day from one extreme of India to the other, I think it must be admitted that hitherto life and property have been as secure in India as in any country under the sun. I did intend to notice at length and in a separate letter the second manifesto by " P.' which appeared in your Wednesday's number. Bat as I came southward I met Th T,nta of this day containing an article on your correspondent's opinions which renders my doing so perfectly unnecessary, for your exposure of them is complete. Two foul streams of error run through the whole field of his argument, and render it wholly worthless. The one is the assumption that toleration necessarily implies the Ignoring of one's own religlon-a disoountenancing of tho truth, and recognizmg and even encouraging what may be abominable superstition. The other is the supposition that our duties as rulers of India have reference only to the natives and their religion, and that we have no duties binding upon us in relation to ourselves and our own holy and true religion. We are to tarn our backs upon onrselves and our faith, and act only with reference to the tender consciences and earnest faith of the Eindoo and Mussulmanl And all this to obtain an easy and quiet tenure of T-ncusI Lus is th .'raitonr poic" dvcaedb India !

Your correspondent appears to me unable to distinguish between toleration and proselytism, and argues as though to avow one's religion was to forcibly proselyte, He would also have deferred the abolition of Suttee and the late alterations made in the Hindoo law until the "Eindoo mind was fully prepared for suoh changes," W il "P." explain how that is to be accomplished, and how many more centuries are to be expended in the operation?

THE INDIAN MUTI.WtS. The foUovwiing is from Diuapore, &tod August -the 15th:-l Oa Saturday, the 25th of July, the thnr.e native i regiments (7th, 8th, and 40th) mutinied at lilnapore, but held in check by Her Majesty's 10th 1 oot and; a field battery of six guns they were 1 sYe to do any violence or harm in that station, althouglh they sueceeded In marching out intact with all their armi. aammunition, and accoutrements. On Sunday they croed the river Soane, 16 miles from Dinaporeand eight miRs-s from Arrah, and upon Monday morning, the 27th of July, marched into Arrah, where they released the prisoners, ahu-t 400, and joined by the guard over them, many hundreds also of armed I deserters and men on leave from other regiment4, they num- . bered 3,000 discipUned troops. These were joined by an equal number of dependents of Koor 8iugh, a native of large property and influencein the neighbourhood, and the combined army took possession of the Governmeat treasury. I should here remind you of what I informed you in a letter, that some weeks ago I had taken the pre- . caution to fortify a small detached two-story house, 50 feet square, with a flat roof, which was in the compound with my main dwellinghouse. This I had done that in case of our being surprised we might have some defenisible place of refuge. It was provisioned with meal, corn, hiscuit, water, wine, and some beer, aU of which I had placed there, with a few other necessaries, some weeks previously; and my preparations almost excited a smile in some of those who were afterwards among the first to acknowledge the value of them. On Sunday the 26th we heard that the muatinous Sepoys were crossing the river Soane in large numbers at a point eight miles from As-ah, and were on their march towards ns. One of the Government officers and I rode out half way, but could not get any positive account or intelligence of their numbers, and, as the despatches sent from Dinapore to warn us had been intercepted, we did not know whether one, two, or three native regiments had mutnlied, and we hoped, but vainly, that they would immediately be pursued. We had 50 Sikh soldiers in Arrah, and, being 16 ourselves, resolved to make a stand. Accordingly, on Sunday night we occupied the bungalow, and the mutineers, after securing the treasure on Monday, attacked us about 9 o'clock a.m. Most of the Europeans, besides revolvers and hog spears, had two double-barrelled guns, or a gun and a rifle, with abundance of ammunition, and providentially a large surplus, from which (when the SikIs supplies began to run short) we made some thousand cartridges. To describe the repeated attsaks, the almost incessant firing, and the hairbreadth escapes we sustained until Snnday, the 2d of August, at sunset, would form a lengthy narrative, and, as I have by me a copy of an official description of it, it occurs to me that the perusal of It will interest you, and save the time It would take me to write more at length. On Sunday afternoon (August 2) we saw an evident commotion among our assailants, and soon after heard faintly the firng of cannon at a distance to the west ward. This afterwards proved to be a 'relieving force, which had marched from Buxar to our assistance, and which the main body of the insurgents went out to meet, but the latter being wholly defeated we passed Sunday night unmolested, and next morning marched out of our shattered but stil stronglittle fort triumphant,but Ihope notvainglorious, in havingkeptatbay foraweeka hundredtimesournumber. Our miraculous preservation should be ever a continual cause of the deepest thankfulness to us all, for excepting some scratches and bruises not worth mentioning but one of our little garrison (a Sikh) was dangerously wounded. Numbers of the enemy were kiUed around us, and in my own dwellinghouse, which was gutted and partially burnt after, everything of value was either destroyed or carried away by the back approach, which we could not command. What we were most apprehensive of for somo days was disease from the odour of dead bodies, and four or five of our own horses (including my best Arab riding horse) were shot and in a state of decomposition within 50 yards of us; but neither was this allowed seriously to affect us. I should now tel you of the terrible disaster which befell a force of nearly 500 men sent from Dinapore to our relief during the middle of the siege. They had on Wednesday night (July 29) incautiously approached Arrah, and fell into an ambush, and there and in the retreat to the Ganges lost one-third of their number kiled and a large proportion badly wvounded, there being but a very few who escaped unscathed, When we heard from our fort (not a mile off) the sudden and heavy volleys about dark midnight we guessed too truly what had occurred, and I believe there were few among us who did not feel far more deeply the reverse which (as the firing grewv fainter) we knew must have befallen our countrymen than that by their defeat we had lost our best and almost only hope of succour. " The nightly treacherous harangues made to us by the mnutineers from the cover of my dwellinghouse, 60yards off, were answered only by us, when there was a pause, by a volley of bullets directed towards the speaker's hidingplace. It was agreed no other answer should ever be given them, and I do not believe there was a man among us who would have allowed himself, If possible, to fall Into their hands alive. The Sikhs have asked me, and I have promised, to baild the well into a permanent one as a aemenLto of their services, and that our little fort shaU have affixed upon It the name of 'Futtehgur;' or, 'house of victory.' For some days after we had been relieved I was engaged in erecting some bridges that had been broken down by the mutineers and restoring the main lines of communication, as field-engineer to Major Eyre's force, when, iu re. turning to Arrah, I received a severe kick from a vicious horse belonging to one of our party. Luckily no bone was broken, but I was laid up for two days, and on the force preparing to leave Arrah I had to be carried into Dinapore. I am now able to go about a little, so that in another week I hope to be as well as ever." The following is a copy of the report by Mr Wake alluded to in the above:- " Sir,-I have the honour to forward for the information of his honour the Lieutenant-Governor the following narra. tive of our extraordinary defence and providential ecape. On the evening of Saturday, July the 25th, I received an express from Dinapore warning us that a disturbance was apprehended on that day, but giving us no other information. On the' morning of the 26th of July a Sowar whom I had at Koelwar Ghbt on the Soane came In and reported that numbers of Sepoys had crossed, und that many more were crossing. I found that Mr. Palin, the railway engtneer stationed at loelwar, had aontented himself with sending over for the boats to the Arrah side the night before, but vwhen leaving had failed to destroy them, as he had promised to do. The police, I imagine, bolted at the first alarm. AUl efforts to ascertain the amount of the force of the rebels were unavailing, and the polieeleft the city on Sunday, the 26th. Thinking it highly unadvisablo to abandon the station when the rebels might be few, and having 50 Sikhs on the spot, and finding the rest of the officers of the station of the same opinion, and that the few residents of the district who had come in were willing to remain, we on the night of Sunday, the 26th, went into a small bungalow previously fortified by Mr. Boyle, the district engineer of the railway company, Our force consisted of one jemnadar and two havildars, two naicks, 45 privates, a bhisti and cook of Captain Rattray's Sikh Police Battalion ; Mr. Litthdale, judge; Mr. Combe, officiating collector; Mr. Wake, magistrate; Mr. Colvin, assistant; Dr. Halls, civil assistants-surgeon ; Mr. Field, sub deputy opium agent; Mr. Anderson, his assistant; Mr. Boyle, district engineer to the railway company; Synd Azimoodeen H. Khan, deputy collector; Mr. Dacosta, moonslff; Mr. Godfrey, schoolmaster ; Mr. Cock, officiating head clerk of the collectorate; *Mr. Tait, secretary to Mr. Boyle ; Messrs. Delpeiron and Hoyle, railway in spectors; and, Mr. de Souza. We had enough ottah ani grain for souse days of short allowance, and a good deal of water for ourselves; but, owing to the shortness of our notice, nothing but the barest necessaries could be brought in, and the Sikhs had only a few days' water; btt as we expected the rebels to be followed up immediately we had not much anxiety on that score. " On Monday, tbo 27th of July, about 8 a.m., the insurgent Sepoys, the whole of the 7th, 8th, and 40th Native Infantry,arrived in the station, and having first released the prisoners, rushed to the Collectorate, where they were at once joined by the Najibs, and looted the treasure, amounttng to 85,000 rupees. This did not take long, and they then charged our bungalow from every side, but, being met with a steady and well-directed fire, they changed their tactics, and, hiding behind the trees with vwhich the compound is filled, and occupying the outhouses and Mr. Boyle's residence, which was unfortunately within 60 yards ofOar fortification, theykept upan incessant andgalling fire ou us daring the whole day. They were joined by numbers of Hoer Sing's men, and the Sepoys repeatedly declared they were acting under his express orders, and after a short time he was seen on the parade, and remained during the siege. Every <endeavour was made by the rebels to induce the Sikhs to abandon us; heavy bribes were oilered to them, and their ow2 countrymen employed as mediators. They treated every ofefr with derision, showing perfect obedence and discfpline. " On the 2tStb two small cannon were brought to play on our bungalow, one throwing 41b. shot, and they were -daily shifted to whaa5 the rebels thought our weakest spots. Finally, Ahe largest was placed on the roof of Mr. Boyle's dwellinglouoso, cmpletely commanding the insids of our bangalow, ad thesrniallest bebind it at a distance of 20 yards. Nothing ^* cowardice, want of unanimnity, and only the ignezoas o.f our enemies prevented owrdor - tification being brought down about our ears. During the entire siege, which lasted seven days, every possible stratagem was practised against us. The cannons were fired as frequently as they could prepare shot, with which they were at first unprovided, and incessant assaults were uade upon the bungalow. Not only did oar Sikhs behave with perfect coolness and patience, but their untiriug labour met and prevented every threatened disaster. Water began to run short; a well of 18 feet by 4 was ius'antly dug in le,s than 12 hours. The rebels raised a barricade on the top of the opposite house; ours grew in the same proportion. A shot shook a weak place in our defence. The place was made twice as strong as before. We began to feel the want of animal food and the short allowance of grain. A sally was made at night and four sheep brought in, and finally we ascertained beyond a doubt that the enemy were undermining us ; a counter mine was quickly dug. On the 30th troops sent to our relief from Dinapore were attacked and beaten back close to the entrance of the town. On the next day the rebels returned, and, telling us that they had annihilated our relief, offered the Sikhs and the women and children (of which there were none with us) their lives and liberty if they would give up the Government offieers. August 1 wo were sall offered our lives and leave to go to Calcutta if we would give up our arms. On the 2d the greater part of the Sepoys went out to meet Major Eyre'S field foree, and on their being soundly thrashed the rest of them abandoned the station, and that night we went out and fonnd their mine had reached our foundations, and a canvassed tube flled with gunpowder was lying handy to blow us up, in which, however, I do not think they could have succeeded, as their powder was bad; and another stroke of the pick would have broken into our countermine. We also! brought inlthe gani which they had left on the top of the opposite house. Daring the whole siege only one man, a Sikh, was severely wounded, though two or three got scratches and blows from splinters of bricks. Every. body in the garrison behaved well ; but I should be neglecting a duty did I omit to mention speeially Mr. Boyle, to whose' engineering skill and untiring exertiGns we in a great measure owe our preservation; and Mfr. Colvin, who rendered the most valuable assistance, and who rested neither night nor day, and took on himself far more than hIs share of every disagreeable duty. In conclusion, I must earnestly beg that his honoar the Lieutenant-Governor wil signaUy reward the whole of our galknt little detachment' of Sikhs, whose service and fidelity cannot be overrated. The Jemadar ehould be at ence made a Soubadar. Many of the restlare'fit for promo. tion, and when required I will submit a list with details." The following is the copy of a letter dated Almorah, August 4:- " You wiU be astonished to find I have left Nynee Tal. The fact Is all ladies, to the number of 90, and as many children, have been ordered away from the Lake, as an attack is expected there-not a very formidable one, hovw ever, but ladies are always best out of the way at such times, and Captain Ramsay knows wel that if a panic did occur every coolie would rush away to his home in the mountains, and then there would be no getting away for any of us. Khan Bahadour Rhani, the Bareilly wretch, has got together such an army as he could raise; it must be a mere rabble, utterly untrained; still they have the effrontery to propose an attack on our fortress, and 3,000 men were reported to have crossed the Kitcha, and reached Huldwanee on Sunday, the 2d. There are now 500 brave little Ghoorkas at the Lake, besides gentlemen to the number of 100. The roads both by Kaleedoongee and Huldwanee are barricaded at intervals for several miles, by means of high stoue walls, which only admit of one man passing up at a tisme, and wehave guns in exellent positions to guard each pass. I believethe present scheme is to allow the besiegers to come up beyond Julee, and then when theyfind themselves with a good steep hUl a-head the Ghoorkas are to get round behind, cut off the road, and so render retreat Impossible. " The Mahomedans in Rampore have found out that their Nawab is friendly to us, and has helped us in sending up supplies &o., though he has not of course been able to take any active part. A powerful party against him exists in his own city, and there is a great chance that the poor man will have fallen a victim on the day of the festival Buckre Eed. If the Nawab's life be taken hisforce of 5,000 will assuredly attempt theKaleedoongee pass; but evenfor thisemergency, though greater than the other, every one says we are pre. pared, and than there is scarcely a probability of any one getting up to Nynee Tal. "M brs. Edwardes has recelved a letter from her husband (Mr. Edwardes, C. S.), which was brought up concealed in a hookah by a native. It is a scrap in pencil, scarcely legible but says he is sWfely concealed by a Ilindoo Rajah in Oude. 14 miles from Futtygurh. The man has a fort and a few guns of his own; consequently powerfuL Mr. and Mrs. Probyn and four children from Futtygurh are also with this Rajah. Theyaxe kindly treated and in safety ;for, though the Nawab of Futtygurh has several times demanded the English whom he conceals, their protector refuses to give them up, and challenges his enermy to get them if he can." The following is from the Camp, Kolapoor- " In my last letter I could only give you a very short account of our little mutiny here. I shaU now tell you all the events that have occurred. On the 1st inst., at half past 8 p.m., Stubbs, Dr. kBroughton, young Heathfield Keith, and myself, after having dined at mess, were playing a game at biUliards, when suddenly there was a violent knooking at the door, and ia rashed the native adjutant and a drill havildar, and! as soon as they had recovered their breath said there was a mutiny in the lines. We were all so excited, and everything in suchl a state of confusion, that I cannot well describe the events of that night, only I know that at 3 o'clock in the morning the Major, Captain M'Culloeh, Stubbs, De Lancey, Keith, and myself took refuge, with 100 men, in a little school. house near the Local Corps' I{nes, after having walked the whole night through pelting rain, among ploughed field., dressed in white mess jaokets and trortsers. At 5 o'clock in the morning we marched down with our 100 men, all the local corps (about 600 men), and 50 of the Southern Mahratta Irregular Horse, to our regiment's lines, where we expected the mutineers would defend themselves. We found, however, that about 210 men had gone away, taking their arms and lots of ammunition with them. The rest of the regiment either quietly joined us in the lines or had run away and hidden them. selves in the fields and villages about, when they he ard the firing. The mutineers had broken into the treasure chests and taken away about C0,000rs. They had torn the regimental colours, and trampled them in the mud; they had taken away or destroyed all the arms and ammunition in stores; they had kiUed one old woman, the native adjutant's mother, and she had only saved his children by hiding them under the beds; they had riddled the major's door and windows withballs, and broken open several of his boxes. The Resident got information that the mutineers had shut themselves up In a strong square building, with loopholed walls and flanking towers at the corners, near the city of Kola poor. He accordingly marched all the local corps out to attack them. When they got there, however, they were greeted by a voUey from inside, fired through the loopholes in the wall He then marched the Locals straight home. This was on the morning of the 2d inst.; from that until the 10th nothing was done. Our men were kept under arms aU day ready to turn out the instant the bugle sounded, and small parties of cavalry -were continuaUy scouring the country to get intelligence of where the mutineers went, and to warn the headmen of villages not to give them food or shelter, On the Oth a party who had been out at a vilage about 16 rmiles off said that the people of the viUage had told them that the three unfortunate young officers who bad not been heard of since the night of the ro w had bean caught and murdered here by the muttineers, and they showed the marks of bullets and the blood on the floor of a native temple. They said their bodies had been thrown into a river that runs near the place; but they have not been fotnd. On the 3d a man named Hossain Ali came in from the city to our lines, where he went to out soubedar.major's house and said to him, I Al the Englishmen in India are to be kiUed. Got the regiment to rise; the city will join you. We will kill the officers, and then the 'Iussulman religion will again be the religion of India.' He also said that a native officer of the S. M. horse would join them with 100 men, The old soubadar put food before him, and said he would go and call some other native officers, and they would consult about how it was to be done. He got two other faithful officers into the house, and told them quietly to keep the man engaged in conversation, and not let him go, while he himself ran up and told the major. Eo then went back and brought the man quietly up through the lines to the major's house. He was then tied and sent into the city, where he was put in Irons in the gaol. The next day four of our officers and I went into the city and tried him by court-martial, after having his irons knocked off. He was then taken out, and shot by six of the S. M. borse in the gaol-yard. The man who commanded the firing party was the native officer who he said was to join them with 100 men. In the meantime about 90 men had come in frem the fields and villages about, who sald they had only run out there on hearing the firing to place their wives and children in safety, not knowing where else to go to; several men had also been brought in by the vilage authorities and by tho parties of irregulars who were riding about the country. They were all sent into the city of Kolapoor, where they were put Into ihe gaol in chains, and guarded by tie Rajah and his people. At night we all sleep at Mughus, wrh them Is -a zry ptrong gnuad kept4 we J awe0 o4tlyng FWikets of borse and foot in every direction, and a regular chain of videttes all roand camp. "We telegraphed on the night of the 1st to Sattara about the row; Kerr, the adjutant of the S. M. Irregulars, started on the morning of the 2d, and was with us, bringing 50 men, on the morning of the 3d, having ridden with his men the 80 miles in 24 hours, and swam their horses over three very deep and rapid rivers which in the rains are considered quite impassible. He is a very fine fellow and a capital speoimen of an irregular horse. man; the other day he rode 240 miles without stopping. Immediately the row occurred Maughan telegraphed to Bombay for Europeans, but they have not been by any means Bo expeditions as Kerr, for, though a steamer was despatched from Bombay immediately with 200 of the 2d Enropeans to Wargoten, and they arrived there on the 3d, they have not been able to get here yet on account of the nullas and rivers being all so flooded. A troop of Horse Artillery, too, started from Poonah, butthey have not arrived here yet for the same reasons. It was at one time feared the whole country had risen ; we might have been all oat to pieces for all they knew, so that they are very much to blame for not having made more haste. Up to the 10th the mutineers had met with no check; on that day, however, we had the great pleasure of doing for a few of them. On the night of the 9th 3aughan received intellgence that 25 of the mutineers with muskets in their hands were coming back in the Kolapoor direction, from a place 16 miles out on the Wargoten road, where they had all gone to at first. Kerr mounted at 12 o'clock at night and set off through the rain with 30 men to meet them. He rode out about 12 miles, and caught three men, but he heard from them that at half-past 11 o'clock the main body of them had marched in and ocoupied the same position which 3raughan had tried to take before. Kerr left his men round about thelplacc to see that they did not go away during the night, and rode in to ask Maughan to give him some more men, and let him try to take the place. Accordingly at 10 o'clock next morning Captaia MXCulloch and I set off with 30 volunteers from our regiment, and Kerr brought out 30 more of his Irregulars. When we got there we found the fellows inside all ready to receive us, with two sentries walking up and down between the wall and the lake, and a man at each of the corner towers, who occasionally fired when any of us came too near. We passed behind the little native huts which lie the road, to a little stone temple, which they had not been able to ocoupy, as it is solid stone, without a door or window; in fact, it is a monument, and not a temple. From here we could see what sort of a place it was. It was a double square, hollow in the middle, like a farm square in Scotland, with a low, tiled shed inside the wall, for putting horses and cattle in. The four doors were all of tremendously hard wood, into which a musket ball did not penetrate half an inch, and the main gate was of the same wood, bound and studded with iron, and about eight or ten inches thick. The two men who were walking up and down the place in front of the little door which looks out towards the lIke began firing at us behind the monument, and our fellows returned shot for shot, but, as neither of them hit, it was not of much use, orly keeping our fellows lirom going nearer. M'Culloch then told me to take some of our men and some of the S. 3L Horse round the lake to a place neat the Rajah's house, where there were trees and bushes which afforded capital cover for skirmishers. From here we soon dislodged the two men, one of whom was hit on the thigh, and they ran inside the square. We could not, however, get very near the square, as there was a little temple at that corner which they had occupied, and from the little window; of which they fired at us. We remained here behind the trees for a longtime, answering their shots, on the chance of some bals going in through the loopholes or veindows. After a while a feUow came riding round the lake to say that all our officers had come down with 20 more men, and that they had got two of the Rajah's guns and were going to blow the main gate open and storm the place. I was told aocordingly to collect my men and prevent any of the felows escaping by the road towards our camp. I thereforo formed my men up and made the horsemen mount so as to be ready to chase them if they came pest, I was here concealed by a bank from the fort, The fellows with M'CnUoch then began blazing away with the guns at the main gate, and I expected every minute to hear that they had broken the gate open and gone in, and was feeling very much disgusted at not being able to go and see the fun, but I felt obliged to stay and watch that road. The gUns soon stopped firing, and I supposed al was over. However, I was soon undeceived, for Kerr and the major came round to the lake where I was, and said they were going to bring the gans there to see if they could open a way in. They said that the guns could only be brought to fire obliquely, and therefore did not have muob effect on the gate, for the balls merely went through, leaving only a mall round hole in the wood, but not breaking It so as to make it passable. The guns were then placed in a nevw position, and we began firing at the little side door. Two bals went through it, but only left little round holes, as in the other door, and no two balls hit on the same spot, for the balls were too small for the guns, and the fellows could not aim them at all-so much so that several balls went right over the place and did considerable damage in the city. While here a native gunner was Idlled from the wals, and one shot Cut my trousers on the left leg, but did not touch the skin. The major, seeing that the guns were not likely to open a way into the place, said to me, ' Wll yoa take a party and turn these felows out who are firing out of the windows of that little temple 9' I got 12 men to volunteer, and we rushed up the road with a shout, six of the men firing their muskets at the windows while running up, the remaining six reserving their fire for closer quarter. I ran up to one window and fired a cavalry carbine wlhich I had used all day right into the place, and one of the men did so to the other. We found, however, that the feUows who had been there had left it, and gone into the main buiding. From round the outside of this temple we could keep them almost entirely from firing from that aide of the buUiding, for if one shot was fired from a loophole it was immediately answered by a dozen, and we were so near that a lot of our balls always went in. The biggest gun was here hauled up close to the lttle door. Herotwo natives were killed; one was bit on the mouth, and the other had the whole of the back past of his head carried away; a ball graued the toe of rmy left boot, Here seven men came out of the plae and gave them. Selves up; one of them had his eye shot out, and another his left arm broken by a cannon-baL All of a sudden we heard a whole lot of shots inside the place, and were told that Kerr had got in on the opposite side by a gate, which they had neglected to guard. We should have bat" tered the little door down in a few more shots, but we could not get It opened at once, as they had piled a lot of big stones inside against it. We rushed at a Lttle door whioh had not been tried before because it was so difficult to get at. We found it not !so strong as the others, and broke it In with a pickaxe and the buts of our muskets. Seoeral men were shot down inside, and three prisoners taken. It is very extraordinary that not one of our men was touched, though they fired a lot of 'hots at us. Six men took refuge in a little room in the middle of the square. This was made of immense blocks of solid stone. There was a small door looking towards the main gate, up to which there were four stone steps; there was a little stone verandah round it, to whdch tho window looked, and which was raised about four feet above the ground. The window was about two feet above the verandah and about four feet square. The door and wooden shutter of the windows were shut. We sent a lot of balls through the door and windows, and they returned them each on the chance of hitting the other. They hit one colour-havildar on the head and one Sepoy on the knee. After a while, finding we could not turn them out without having scme of our men hurt, which we did not wish, we resolved to smoke them out, and accordingly threw a lot of lighted grass before the door. One man, seeing that they were to be burnt out, sprang out of the little window like a tiger with his loaded musket in his hand, evidently resolved to sell his life dearly. I happened to be standing clo3e to the window, and shot him through the head with th.' carbine I had used all day. He fel aU in a heap stone dead. On finding the smoke insufferable they came out one by one, only to be shot down by our men immediately. The square was now an awful sight, with eight or ten dead bodies lying on the ground and the whole place streaming with oblood, and the prisoners some of them frightfully wounded." The following is written by a gentleman in the 3engal Civil Service:- h Calcutta, Aug. 23- "Whert I last wrote Arrah had just been relieved by Major Eyre and the detachment of the 5th. Since that Koor Singh has been welU thrashed at Jugdespore and driven to the south. He has committed some plundering about Sasseram, and is said to have betaken himself, with a sma rabble of followers, to Rotas, or its neighbourhood. Order will, I trust, soon be restored in the Shahabad district. " In Gya there haq been nothing more than what would occur anywhere at any time if all the Cvil authorities were suddenly to withdraw, as was there and elsewhere done under orders, The thieves and robbers of the neighbour hood plundered the kutcheries and some private houses, and those who had grudges agaist their neighbours began to hope and prepare for an epportunity of vengeance. But all this has been arrested by the immediate and stern disavowal of -'a at and the prompt return of the autho- rities. I do not think that we shall have any more senrous matter In the Gga district " Mozufferpore, which was as quiet ana unthreatened as Calcutta, has escaped wonderfully, and the anthorities having returned all is going well. The gaol and treasury guards did their duty stoutly, and the townspeople stood up for themlselves. There were eome 16 of Holmes's Sowars in the place, who were too few to have attempted misehief if the civilians had remained. When theselatter were ordered away the Sowars robbed their stables of all their horses and made off. They tried to liberate the prisoners and to plunder the treasury, but were fired on and driven back by the guards. They tried to do a little loot, also, in the town, but were beaten by thetownspeople. Nine laos of rupees were in the treasury, and all has remained safe. " Chuppra was abandoned with somewhat more reason, because it was really threatened bya strong party of Holmes's Irregular Horse. Still the flight was very hasty and precipitate, and, had a little more courage existed, it is probable that the station might never have been a&-andoned. "There has been no outrage and no plunder there because of the spirit and loyalty of a Mahomedan resident, well known in those parts, and (hitherto) always doubted-a cert ain Cazee Ramzan Allee. He assumed the command on the departure of the Europeans, kept everything quiet and loyal, and has since delivered over his charge, prisoners and all, In perfect order to the returned civilians. He and others who have similarly behaved will, you may be sure, be handsomely rewarded. "At Patnah all Is in order. "The houses, publie and private, at Gya and at Arrah have been gutted, and in some cases destroyed; in Arrah by the mutineers, in Gya by the prisoners released by their guards. " All the Ramghur Battalion (except the cavalry) have mutinied aud driven off the authorities, but the country and the Zemindars are thoroughly quiet and loyal. The following is a sketch of tho state of affairs in those districts:- "H-anchee or Doremda.-The clvil and military authorities were obliged to retreat, having remained til the latest moment. The muiAneers, having four guns with them, have remained at Doremda, from some motive not yet understood. Some say they are waiting for the arrival of their out-detachments from the other stations before proceeding westward; some that they are endeavouring, vainly, to get some local Zemindar to join and head them. They are viewed with no kind of sympathy by the people and iD we conld move speedily upon them would be scattere,. But our want of men and means has hitherto prevented us (most unfortunately) from taidng the promptmeasures so greatlyrequiredfor theoccasion. A brigade is, however, in preparation, and will march some time this week ri the Grand Trunk-road and Hazareebsgh. " At the place last named there was a detachment of the 8th Native Infantry. These mutinied and comnitted some destruction, the prisoners here as everywhere else being released. The mutineers have gone off (no one yet knows whither), and the commissioner is about to reoccupy Hazsreebagh with a small party of Rattray's Sikh corps, "At Peurulla (Maunbhoom) the small detachment of the Ramghur battalion mutinled and went off after plunderIng and destroying the houses and pazt of the town. "Chyebassa (Singbhoom) was hastily abandoned by - before any show of mutiny had taken place. But the liajah of Sereikhrla, a powerful and very loyal rajah of that country, has stepped forward to protect the station, and as far as we know has entirely suceseded. Both Peurulia and Chyebassa will be immediately reocoupied by eivil officers backed by a small force of Sikhs. " From Bhagulpore, which is quite quiet, the 5th Irre. gular Cavalry have decamped without beat of drnm. They have gone to Dooghur and Rohnoe, and thence towards Gya, where they will fall into a trap, as they know not that Gya is reoccupied both by Europeans and Sikhs. " These runaways tried to raise the 32d Native Infantry at Bowsee, but, wonderful to say, were resisted and fired upon. They have plundered a little here and there. I fear from the wretched weakness of our means they will con. tzive to get away to the westward uninjured. " The santhals are perfectly quiet. " At Julpogoree, the 73d Native Infantry and two troops of the 11th Irregular Cavalry are a subject of much anxiety. There have been several attempts to get up a mutiny, but on each occasion the persons concerned have been apprehended and sent away prisoners. On the last occasion a Brahmin Sepoy of the 73d armed himself and defied authority, calling on the other Sepoys to join him and destroy the Feringhees. At the order of the officer of the day he was shot without hesitation by a party of the quarter-guard, and his body thrown into the Teesta. " Young - has been evincing great judgment and courage as joint magistrate of Julpogoree. He has for many weeks carried his life in his hand, and isyet I fear in danger, " All the rest of Bengal is quiet. " The opium advances are about to be made, and we look for quiet and good order to insure the crop. With very few exceptions the Zemindars of our provinces are very loyal, and the people in no way disposed to tumult."
THfE PR&SBNT CRLSIS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Are we as a nation putting forth all the energy the present crins demands? Is it possible to magnify the real importance of this Indian rebellion ? The press o'erfows with expressions of opinion as to the origin of the evil and the means when we are at peace again of preventing its recurrence; three men out of every five you meet will tell you, "It was just what was to be expected." Lord This, General That, Civilian So-and-so, and Missionary The-well-known had all prophesied the Sepoys would rebel; in vain had these able, experienced, and despised men warned successive Governments; their advice was rejected, and now behold the consequence ! No man ever yet had his house burned down without being told an ho looked upon its ashes that had he long since done thin or that he would have been spared the conflagration; and he is fortunate indeed if he is not further reminded how he had been warned of the dangerous nature of the hall stove, the library chirney, or the kitchen flue. Of one thing alone does he feel certain, that he must build up again if he can. Surely, Sir, we should do more wisely if we weie to look for the present at what the present state of thiugs demands of us, and postpone for a while our theorizing on the original causes which have brought us to our present grief. One duty lies at the door of all-deep sympathy with those who mourn their dead, done to death under circumstances which, thank God, I lelieve have no parallel in history since the world began. Those who have looked on war's work, and seen men as sabre, bayonet, shell, and bullet deal with them,-who, turning from the sight presented to the eye, have dwelt for a moment on what mothers, wives, andisisters would feel, saw they that sighthave learned to regard war in its true light; they have eeen and thought on the price paid for glory in the field. I have considered in my folly that in such a scene I had read one of the worst pages in life's history. I can now combine all I ever saw or read or conceived of what war, pestilence, and fanine could do to afflict the dying, and those who, loving, would mourn them; the scenes in India as only partially in mercy revealed to us throw it all into shadow. We must borrow from the poet's conception of hell's work, were it possible to picture it, could we paint the work wrought not on men alone, but on women, girls, children, infants ! What man or woman lives, possessed of the commonest feelings of humanity, whose heart can find vent for the pity felt for those who in the bonds of relationship, or by the ties of friendship, owned but one sufferer in this weak band of martyrs to a ferocity which would be a libel on the brutal passions and savage cruelty of the worst of brute kind ? I read with joy of the noble gift of the Ecaperor of the French. I hail with exceeding joy the gift of the Sultan to the fumd now raising for the sufferers by the mutiny in India. I should augur ill of blessing to the rule of the ruler of any nation who from any cause whatever withholds his tribute to this fund. No money can heal the wounds of those who have been heartstricken, as connected with the victims of these awful massacres. Still, such misery may be preserved from the aggravation of added penury. I would appeal to every nation, not for the mere value of the gift in money which can be bestowed, but because I would count the gift as proof of thu utter horror of the donor at the cruelties worked on women and children. It is not a case of war's usual horrors, nor is it simply a rebellion, a civil war; on these different nations might hold different opinions, and in the eye of some nathres the enemies of our rule might be right. It is the case of deeds done in wanr, which cry aloud to every nation for an expression of feeling that In no war, in no conrdition of strife ans between man and mnan, can such deeds be done and not call for execration at the mouth of every people claiming the leat semblance of civilization. I would pray to see the Ministers of every form of Government which marks man's rule in any part of the globe specially ordered to exprem sympathy with those who suffer from these atrocities, the indignation of their several Courts at the perpetrators of them. I would pray that this age in which we live should testify from every clime, in every language, to one common feeling of just reprobation of practices in war that defile even the basest picture history has ever given of man at his worst in lust and cruelty. Tell me not there can be no real demand for such vast sum of money. Is this a time, is this a call on our charity which should raise up that huckstering spirit which would appraise the want we seek to relieve to the very letter, lest we should waste a shilling on it? The roll of our contributions should tell of the depth of our feelng for the event which has called for them; it should not be a mere record of our conviction that there is want which should be relieved. When the poorest man gives his penny, or the less poor give of their silver, when the gold of the richer is given, I would accept it in the belief that in every penny I read the giver's solemn condemnation of the wickedness that wrought the misery, with a desire to lessen that misery where it has fallen. I would make this fund a vehicle to express, not only this nation's feeling, hut the feeling of all of every nation, who by showring their sense of what has happened would give to history proof that the fiendish conduct of these mutineers and their _bettors was to the rest of the world a foul and cruel abomination. I will only now add a word or two on one other plain duty. The hands of our rulers must be strengthened; it is no time for recrimination, it is an hour for action. Our trained fighting men must be sent, if not to regain what we have lost of " possession," to protect and save those loyal to us-all who are threatened by these miscreants. No Government can part with its army frorn homa unless it sees good cause to txust to other means of upholding order there. 'We have not only to recruit the army, to fill the ranks of the Militia, but we have to kindle and keep up that feeling which should make every true Englishman sensible of the fact that at the present crisis all have a part to play. In the fulfilment of every social duty, in extra jealousy on the side of order and true loyalty, as shown by every good citizen of the State, must depend for a long time our hope of passing safely through this crisis. If there is an appeal to the chivalry of the young, the healthy, and strong to take up arms in the cause of insulted, outraged humanity; if the cry that rises from the "w well" at Cawnpore appeals to manhood to see justice done upon the base butchery which there scarce sought to veil its horror; if to that cry there are yet found I trust thousands strong in heart and arm to respond, I also trust that in every class to whom it is denied to take this active service there will be found a strong conviction that in the preservation of order and peace at home, in the rigid fulfilment of social duties, we too shall lend no little aid to the nation's great work. May we be a nation whose conduct shall be in consistency with its profession of Christianity I Let us not stint our charity, be slack to do justice before God and man; but let us be careful so to act, even under the worst provocation, that we may with confidence seek God's blessing on our armies at the scene of -war, on our every national source of Atrength at home. S. G. o.
TO THE EDITOR OF THB TIME& Sir,-I should be greatly obliged by your publishing the accompanying letter from the secretary of a certan " foreign affairs committee' in Sheffield, and one from me in reply to it. I ask this favour, not merely for the eake of clearing myself from a false accusation, but because it seems to me that there are a great !anhy persons just at present who seem, like this Sheffield committee, to have overlooked the distinction between justice and vengeance. I am. Sir. annh in,,+ r W. C. MAGER. 11, Henietta-street, Bath, Sept. 30. " Council-hall, Sheffield, Sept, 26. "Rev. Sir,-I am directed by the Foreign Affairs Com. mittee to send for your consideration one of their letters to the vicar of Sheffield, and also a letter signed ' Caritas' thereon. '- You say-' We have to do justice, needful justice, upon those wretches who have so barbarously butchered our coun. trymen and countrywomen.' "You are a minister of religion. Why do you ' preach vengeanee?' If a dog was intentionally driven mad, and during that madness had committed acts of violence, would you punish the dog, or the man who had driven the dog mad I " 'We have fearful dangers before us, and difficult duties to perform.' Yes, ' we have to do justice' on tho3e who have driven the Sepoys to revolt. That justice can be had in England. It is, therefore, your dsty to investigate the cause of the revolt, and if you find anyone guilty to demand justice on them. "II have the honour to be, Sir, " Your most obedient servant, "The Rev. W. Magee, x iA. "C. NUTTAULL, Sec." " 11, Henrietaotreet, Bath, Sept. 28. Sir,-I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter on behalf of the 'Foreign Affairs Committee,' In which, after quoting an extract from a speech of mine delivered in Bath, you ask why I, ' a minister of the Gospel, preach vengeance.' In reply I beg to say I do not and never did ' preach vengeance.' In the very speech from which you quote I used these words,-' God forbid that I, a minister of the Gospel, should speak of vengeance.' I did say that we had to do justice on murderers. If the 'foreign affairs committee in She'field' cannot distinguish between justice and vengeance I hope that I can. "I belive that murderers should be put to death, not from any desire for vengeance, but for the seourity of society and in obedience to the law of God. I trust that I caa forgive a criminal wvho has injured me, and yet I do not hold that my forgiveness of him as an individual Christian is any reason why the State should pardon his crime. You seem to me to confound the obvious distinction between the duties of the State and those of the individual. The State must punish crime; it is a 'revenger to execute the wrath of God on those who do ill.' Tho individual ought from his heart to forgive aU offences. If it be ' vengeance' to punish criminals, or if the State is to forgive as freely and fuUy as the individual Christian all offences, there is an end of all society. " Your illustration of the mad dog driven mad by illusage is a singularly unhappy one. I would certainly punish the man who had driven it mad; but I would as certainly kill the mad dog too, to hinder him from killing me or others, and, moreover, I would kill him first, and I should thinkc the man a mischievous fool who tried to save him by sending me and others off on a hunt after the man who had driven him mad. Just1.ce noon negLgent or tyrannical Englishmen does not imply pardon for Sepoys who have ravished and burned women and hacked little children into small pieces. "If you had taken the trouble to read to the end the speech you criticise, you would have seen that I did speak of the duty incumbent on us of 'searching into all the causes of the recent mutiny,' of ' discovering and punishing aU wrongdoing, and of reforming whatever we might have done "It is somewhat singular that the clergyman whom you have selected to hold np to opprobrium, and afterwards to remonstrate with for preaching vengeance in Bath, should have been one who on two occasions preached most earnestly against vengeanee, reminding his hearers that it was their duty as Christians to endeavour to forgive even their cruel and bloodthirsty enemies in India, and strongly warning themn against giving way to the cry for savage and indiscriminte vengeance now raised by too many in Eng. land. "That I had done this you might have known had you observed the ordinary courtesy of inquiring whether my speech was correctly reported before printing an extract from it, with what I must caU the false heading affixed to it of ' Clergymen calling for Vengeance.' There are other duties enjoined upon Christians besides that of not preaching vengeance. The same word which commantls us to ' love mercy' commands us also to ' do justice.' " Yonr foreign affairs committee, in their zeal for teaching 'ministers of the Gospel' the duty of remembering the former precept, have forgotten their own duty of obeying the Latter. " And now, as you have asked mo one question, I will ask you another. W,hat course do you think ought to be taken with the Indian mutineers ? If thev are the inuocent and injured party-if, as you say in your Free >1r.s, even those EnElishwomen and children they slewr were ''not Innocent,' and therefore deserved punishment, we are bound to admit our wrong, withdraw our troops, and leave our guilty countrymen and women in Lucknow and Agra to their merited chastisement at the hands of those they have oppressed. But if we are not to do this-if we are to put down the revolt, and to rescue our endangered countrymen and women, then I should like to know how this is to be done without kiUing a great many of these same Sepoys whom you say it is unjust to kill, or even to 'pursue. Will you therefore distinctly avow your sentiments upon thispoint? Is theIndian revolt to be sunpressed, or is it not? If it is not, what is to become o the English in India? If It is, what do you mean by deprecating as unjust any punishment or pursuit of the revolted Sepoys? "I am, Sir, your obediont servant "W .MA.GEE, "To C.

RECRUITING. TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I was standing with some curiosity before a very taking placard, headed with the Qaeen's arms, and urderneath the bold legend, " Britons, arise I avenge your laughtered countrymen and countrywomen in the East" (all in bold capitals); then " The Indian Mutiny I" beneath -which there was a very glowimg account of the glorious life of theBritish soldier in India, which on the whole was not much exaggerated, for it merely stated that he was generally carried in a palanquin if indisposed for marching, and that he had a servant to attend to him when in camp or cantonments, with a constant service of hotcoffee,tea, andereature nouriahmentewhen on duty, when I observed two young men approach the wall on which it was placed and begin to read it. They were well-dressed stout young fellows of the middle ranks, and very good stuff for soldiers-at least they would have served willingly with Cutts or Lygon in the old days, and no disgrace to them. But as they read they laughed; and Sergeant Twiggs, who was lying perdu in a little nook close by, and who popped out hio much be-ribanded head at the sound of their footsteps in the quiet cloister-angle of the old cathedral yard, at once began to grin sympathetically with them, and gave a maonic nod, which plainly said, "Ah, you're too good forme,-you see through poor Twigga's flununery," and then he popped in again. The young men laughed heartily when they came to the end, and then went in to visit the cathedral. Now, why did they laugh t Because they knew the placard was a lie and its promises humbug, and that Twiggr the moment theytook the shilling would laugh in their faces, and send them off to try their hot coffee and palanquins and native servants at Brompton Barracks cheek by jowl with the general steepings of society, which constitute a proporton of the rank and file of our-as of all-soldiers. I watched on and very soon came three lads of the bumpkin order-two hobbledehoys who would grow into fine stout five-nine men-one a sinewy youngster the beau ideal of a light cavalry man, and evidently used to horse from the peculiar curve of his leg and absence of calf to it. One of them read the placard for the others. Twiggs advanced hopefully, his face radiant with smiles, a veritable Mars t-iumphlns. "Now, my lads," he began, but be was cut short by a horse laugh, " None of yer gammon of us, Mister Sergeant, don't you think we knows 'ow you served the Militiers ?" And so they departed. Now, what Sergeant Twiggs ever did to the Milith I don't know, nor could he teU me, but it was evident tt on the mind of these young men was engraved the permanent idea thatTwiggs was a deceier and a liar because he wore a red coat and wanted them to enlist, and because faith had somehow or other been broken with some friendc of theirs by him or his like. And this feeling is, I fear, very common. It has arisen greatly, I fear, from the false pretences under which many recruits are entrapped; but, above all, I believe it is to be traced to the exasperation prodnced in men's minds when they have enlisted by finding that their bounty is a mere myth, and that their pay is absorbed under all sorts of forms and excuses What would mv friend Titmarsh's very elegant domestic have said, if the day after he had covenanted to shed round the said Titmarsh the glories of his presence, and to give him aid and succour in the affairs of his mansion at 301. per annum, he was told " Your livery cost me 201., and I pay a guinea a-year for the powder in your hair, and the beer costs me -" ioulm not Jseames, ere he got thus far, have given him instant warning and commenced pulling off his smallclothes instanter ere the sentence was finished, and have told all his friends Titmarsh was a scoundrel and no gentleman ? But John his brother who 'listed in Consequence of the parish constable having something to Bay to him from the guardians, and who has made up his mind to do something very handsome for the poor thing out of his bounty, and to save 6d. a-day out of his pay for her-he can't give warning, he can't get away when he hears that all bounty and most of his pay are mere figments of the recruiting sergeant. But he too tells all his friends. Depend onitwe must do away with the present systemofobtainingsoldiers underfalsepretences, and our excellent clergymen would do good service if they promised, aa no doubt they wrill be justified in doing on Humiliation Day, that the country will deal honourably and generously with those who come to her assistance In the hour of need. Let us not be deceived by the talk of 1,000 men recruited per weekr. Ak any offlcer of experience how many of them he would take if he was not compelled? "Why," said an old officer in oommand of a regiment to me the other day, "out of 20 men I'm compelled to let into the regiment there are not five who will ever make soldiers fit to fight; the old sort somehow or other are not to be had." How many do you think of the Tipperary Militia, whose dismissal was attended with a riot, because the men, right or wrong, thought themselves badly treated when they were stripped of their clothes by the Governmient, will go into the Line now? And yet, If names afford an index of nativity, it is not the Scot but the Irishman who is fighting hardest, and getting most knocks, in India just at present. Emigration has dried up many a prolific stream w hich went to swell the current of our armies formerly in the Highlands and in Ireland, annd I much fear that a similar effect wil be produced in Wales and England. A most intelligent ironmaster told me the other day at Wolverhampton that it wras scarcely possible to procure hands because the ablebodied were emigrating-to escape what ?-the enrolment in the Militia. At the bottom of all this aversion to military service I am satisfied there is not only the feeling that the profession of arms is not " respectable," but the persuasion that those who follow it have begun by being dupes, and then close it ingloriously by duping others. Keep faith with the lower classes as well as with the higher. Make the word "soldier" synonymous with " armed citizen paid for his services by the State, with prospects of rank and money," and you will get abundance of the youth of the middle classes to eerve in the ranks, especially if there are regiments which get a name for being composed of that class. Let us make any sacrifice, pay any millions, ere we resort to foreign mercenaries. Your very obedient serant. W. EL F4

Mr. X.ARDIz acid it w;as a very proper regulation, but umest he overrilel by the mastrate's o der in criminal cases. Mrs. Leach, the complaWmt, was then sworn. The message produced wvra not in her handwriting, nor had it been si5ned by her *tholity. Both the body of the dooument and'tbe slgnaturs were in the hxfvdwritirg of the defendant. It wa. addressed to witness's+brotber, Mr. William Thomas Billings, at- Yarmouth. He -was staying at Yarmouth at that time. He was a surgeon. His mother was in-perfect heath. Mr. Sletgh.--But it is noi, signed " Emily Leach ;" It is *Elriabeth. Complainant.-It is " Ell'eah." '-&r. Sleigh-Have you been on rny terms of'intimacy w-ith her? Complainant.-Cn dear, no. I !have known her about a t'velvemonth. lir; Sleigh.-Has she not been frequently at yourhouseyour mother's house? Conaplainant.-Not fteqoently. She hae bee-ihere. She -was under my brother's.proection. Mr. Sleigh.-Did sbe not live -with him as his 'wife? Complainant.-No, Sir. MIr. Sleigh.-Did heo.ot take her with him as-his wife? OomplaLnant.-Not w.th him. She followed'im. She is not his wife. She hs been living 14 years with a foreign gentleman. Mr. Sleigh.-Has he not, to your knowledge, promised her marriage? complainaUt.-Not to my inowledge. I have a letter here will show her chbacter. Mr. Slelgh.-It is not to- yoszr credit to show-such feeling towards one of your own sex, but I hope you don't know all the infamous treatment she has received. -Sir, my client is a lady by birth and education whomi the complainant's brother induced to go abroad with him, and passed her as his wife. He then deserted her in a foreign-country, aud lef t her to find her way home as she might. Now, Sir, this is a family dispute for -where a man seduces a woman under apromise of marriage I consider she is his wihinin the sight of God, if not of tbe- law. Now, under these circumstances supposing they had proved to your satisfaction .l -that is aleged, can it be -said -that to resort to- such an e>-. pedient to ebtain an -interview is a forgery? The essenco of the forgery is the intent to defraud, and I think if you apply your mind to that point you will not say that any -such felonious intent is shown. I defv any one to sesreb all the books -and produce anything like a Parallel case. It would lead to most fearful abuse if such -a precedent were establshed. We should have persons punished for sending valentines in a false name if it came to that. -Mr. JARDSIE.-W'hether it is a forgery at common law Is very doubtfml, but it cannot for a moment-be spoken of but as a very serious offence in some way or other. It is as gross a fraud aG one can well conceive. Mir. Sleigh.-Of course, Sir, it is not to be justsifed. But I am prepared, if necessary, to produce evidence which will disabuse your mind of any impression that there has been anything like moral turpitude on the part of the defendant. She may be sued for any expenses the parties may have been put to, though I believe the fact is lhe did not come, and nobody was put -to any inconvenience. But as for there bcirg a case for a criminnal charge it is out of the question. Mr. JARDi-iN-& think you are right there. The tech. nical defintion of fergory involves the intention to deceive anl defraud. Hero-is the intention to deceive -for the pur- ,ose of brlnging him to towI, but that does.not amount to defrauding him. -Still I would caution her not to attempt such a thing again. Mr. Sleigh.--She will certainly not do so again. Mrs. Leach here expressed a desire to read a letter which she said would throw some light on defendant's character. Mr. Sleigb.-Thees people have used my client nmost shamefully, and I am driven to say that Mr. Billings brought her to hisown mothde ishouse and introduced har there as his wife. -The surmmons was then dismissed. AIr. E. A. Bennett, -of Charing-cross Hospital, attended to explain an error which he said must have arisen either from an error in the statement he made at this court a, few days back, in reference to the case of Ellen Harvey, or fromn an inaccuraey in the report. He did not say, or, at all events, did not intend to sav-tsthat It was 1 o'clock when the girl was brought to the hospital, but 11 o'clock, as correctly stated by Mr. Sprague. Mr. Bennett certainlv did say 1 o'clock.] In the course of the day the girl was again brought up, when-her mother attended and stated that she had been decoyed from her home by a person who kept a house of bad repute in Eagle-court, who was constantly seekinr to regain her control over her. If -the magistrate would send an officer to caution this woman against any further inter. ference she (the mother) would undertake the charge of the defendant. Mr. JA rtmii accordingly sent an officer to caution the woman, and the prisoner was given up to her motlher.

He ran across the street, and was informed by Mr. Holdom that his little boy bad seen two men go into Mr. Whitehead's house, and he feared that something wrong was going on. The witness went to the door and gave four loud knocks, but received no reply, and, consequently, be placed Mr. Holdom to watch Mr. Whitehead's private door, while he (witness) placed himself at the shop door. In a few seconds the shop door was opened very cautiously and the two prisoners came out. Davis was first, and with him the witness closed, saying that he had been waiting for him.

I EUROPEA2N CAVALRY rB IrDIA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Your remarks in a recent number on the European Cavalry of India are, indeed, well timed. Having been employed with them In India in a civil capacity I venture to state the result of my experience. Brought fresh into the battlefield our Dragoons are terribly effective, but the tall men, with their cumbrous accoutrements (often comprising in marching order head and heel ropes and clumsy tent-pegs), form a load so heavy that after a journey at ail fatiguing the horses are knooked up, and often put for weeks together hors de conbat from sore backs. In marching equipment the weight of our Dragoons exceeds, I believe, 18 stone, and, while a hot climate tells against the horses, they are smaller and weaker than those of England. Nothing to be conceived would increase the efficiency of our Indian army more than a body of active, well made, and well mounted young men weighing from S to 10 stone, and not taller than oft. 8in. Our smaller class of grooms (already good riders) might be speedily converted into "superb troops," and no doubt men accustomed to horses, and other recruits of light weight, might be speedily obtained in this country. On arrival in India these men might be officered by the Company's officers that belonged to the mutinous regiments, and sent in the first place to complete their dril to the I nearest cavalry stations. If sent to Bombay, Poonah (a fine climate) should be their first destination. There they would be drilled under efficient European superintendence. Under a similar system another larger body might be despatched to Bengal, and perhaps another to Madras. Bombay is the greatest horse-market in Asia. Supplied with horses from Arabia, Persia, Bagdad, Muscat, Bareen, Cabul, &c., horses are more easily procured at the capital of Western India than at any other place in the East. Some pretty good horses might also be obtained from the immediate dependencies of Bembay, and the co-operation of the civil authorities in the Deccan and Kattewar might be called-into requisition in such an emergency. The Poonah and Southern Kabratta Horse are not badly mounted, and from the districts where their horses are bred others might be procured. Should Government decide on raising really light European cavalry orders might at once be transmitted to the Governmento at Calcutta and Bombay to procure horses, so as to have the men mounted as soon after their arrival as possible. Cavalry drill-sergeants might be held in readi. ness, and instruction commenced immediately the recruits arrived. The Arab are, of course, the hest4zorses, but those of the highest caste are very small, and, being highly prized, are very dear. A coarser Arab used in the Madras and Bombay cavalry would answer this service admirably. These and other well-bred or stoutly formed animals might be accepted from the height of L4 hands . inch, but what are called country bred should not probably be under 14 hands 2 inches. The stud-bred horcbs of Be-gal are large and showy, and superior to country horses; but, judging fronm the little I have seen of them, Iapprehend they are liable to be nervous and vicious. The greatest ecare should be taken to haveaike saddles and accoutrements as light as possible. The saddle-trees should be carefully adapted tothe backs of cmall horsos, and several sizes provided for. It is so mntimes forgotten t}lat what is a small horse in England is a %arge o%e in Indiz.

No lives have beea lost, nor kas any one been seriously injured. When the mail train, which left Lime-street, Liverpool, at 23 minutes pad, 10 on Sunday night, had reached within a fevv miles of Rugboy, at 2 o'lock this morning, the passengers experenced a very severe shoek. The carriage next to the guard's breakvan had its windows broken, and was otherviee so much injured that it was taken off and left at Rugby. The guard was very much b.uised about the head and face. He was, hovwaver, well enough to come on by the train, but not in aharge of it. Only one gentleman, who received a severe contus!on on the forehead, remained at Rugby; the other passeAgers were bruised and much shaken, bat aU went forward. No bones were broken. The engine driver and stoker were injured. On investigation it was found that no lesg than three coupling irons were broken, those which attached the engine to the break vans. The engine, being thus released, went forward with great speed, and it was 15 minutes before it returned. The cause of the accident is unknowni,-Liverpool Daily Poet of Monday,
