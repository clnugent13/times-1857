3rlAC4DBSTER BXHIBITION OF ABS' TRBAhUBj. 'Continued from v%cTm, a Friday, may 22.) A very few years 2go eystematic study and illuslZration of the Spanish schools of painting by help -of materiala accessible in this country would have teen equally Impossible. Thanks, however, to the BLbours of Iord and Stirling, and the examples of Spanish art which have of late been collected here, -owing principaDy to the dispersion of the Spanish gallery of Louis Philippe, both the literary and pietoxial materials for estimating the painters of the Tenimnula are now within our reach. The treaeures of the Spanish school in this country have Been liberally contributed by their poasessors to -the Manchester Exhibition. The Duke of Wellington anight have materially enriched its walls by the loan -of his fine example3 of Velasquez; -but the contribu-tions of the Duke of Bedford, the Marquis of Hert-lord, the Earl of Elgin, Lord Overstone, Mr. Stir.ling, Colonel Hugh Baillie, Mr. Hoskins, Mr. MIorritt, and others have done much to make the absence of the Duke's pictures immaterial. We -could have wisbed, however, that-the Spanish de.partment of the Exhibition had been arranged with. -ome little regard to sequence and schools. Owing to the irregular way in which the examplec to which we have referred in this article are scattered about the gallery, it is equally difficult to examine the pictures in their order, and to find out their numbers in the catalogue; our numbers are thcse of the second edition, just issued. Twenty years ago Velasquez and--Murillo were lor us the sole representatives of the art of Spain. 'We are now enabled to estimate more adequately -the merits of those great masters by comparison -with the works of their teachers and of contempo:rary painters of their respective schools. The Man-cheater Exhibition furnishes examples of each of the thr*e great divisions into whichthebest writers on the subject have distributed the Spanish picturesthe school of Castile, to which among the Spanish painters here represented belong Juan Fernandez Wavarrete, commonly called El Mudo, from his being deaf and dumb; Theotocopuli, called El Greco, from his Greek origin; and the greatest of all, Velasquez;-the school of Valencia,fhere exemplified by Joanes (215, 893S, and Francisco de Ribalta <230) ;-and the schoo of Seville, most fertile of all, ror it nursed the incipient powers of Velasquez, and is here represented by examples of Francisco Eerrera (238, 965) and Pacheco, his two masters, -and their predecessors Campana (208) and De 'Vargas (240); of Juan de las Roelas (529, 530), and Ehis greater pupil Z%rbaran (790, 793, 796, &c.); of Alonzo Cano (748, 762, 923); and, crowning ;glory of the school, of Murillo himself. Spanish -art, though it grew np when Italian art was srapidly on the wane, so that the prime of the one ¢corresponds nearly to the lowest decrepitude of the other, mnaintained throughout its activity a robustnesa and power due to its devotion to religion in a -country where faith never lost its earnestness, and to its consecration to portraiture among a race which, -with all its faults, was always serious in outward -aspect and dignified in bearing. The almost exclusive dedicatioll of art to reli,gion in the Peninsula was, no doubt, partly owing to the passionate fervour of Spanish Catholicism in the 16th and 17th centuries, still more to the -aleepless control of the Inquisition, which laid *as strongly repressive a band on the painter's penciR as on the writer'sper or thetongue of the preacher. :Religious art in Spain, moreover, was eminently ccealistio, It took the nuodels of its saints and martyrs from the churches, convents, and monasteries; its personages and scenes of New Testament history from the field and the wayside. In this way it was preserved from sinking into the effete mannerism of the Italian eclectics. However heavenward its aim and aspiration, its foot was always planted on com3non earth. The rise of Spanish art dates back to the middle -of the 15th century, but its true prime extends from about 1590 to 1680, the period which includes Zurbaran, Velasquez, and Murillo. What precedes this is of more autiquarian than artistic interest. What follows is comparative weakness. The school of Castile was founded in Toledo -during the 15th century, and flourished under the :prelates and religious foundations of that city tilL 4he close of the reign of Charles V. In Toledo are -atill to be seen the masterpieces of El Greco (A.D. l.548-1625). Of this painter the Exhibition has two examples-the portrait of Pompeyo Leoni, the ,sculptor (518), interesting as the collector from the sale of whose gallery our Charles I. acquired -the nucleus of his great coUection of pictures at Whitehall; and the portrait of the painter's -own beautiful daughter (234), contributed by Mr. Stir]ing. El Greco was a native of Venice, bora -of Greek parents, and probably studied under Titian. As a painter he was of great but un-equal merit, recalling in his best works the splendid colour of his Venetian master, in others resorting to a mad play of brush, which makes his -canvasses disagreeable agglomerations of patchy -colour and thin darting lights. His portrait of Leoni is a modified example of this worse -nanner-the charminL- head of his lovely daughter -3 specimen of his more pleasing style. The briltiant complexion and bright black eyes of -this sweet face are set off by the nun-like -white drapery drawn over the head and fastened under the chin; and few who pass along this gallery are likely to go by the picture without pausing to enjoy its loveliness. The visitor should not pass by the " Magdalen 'taling off her Pearls" (208) of Campana (A.D. 2503-1570) without notice, due less to the merit -of thepicture than to its interest as the work of -one of those Flemings naturalized in Spain who brought to that country the tradition of the ItalicoFlemish school of Van (jrley and Coxcie. In " The Virgin and Child adored by Saints" (240) of Luis de vargas (A.D. 1502-1568) we should look for the -expression of that austere fervour of belief which marked the life of this Sevillian painter, who often prepared himself for his work by a penitential scoluging, and from time to time lay down in the -coffin which he kept at his bedside to remind him -of his latter cnd. The pictures of Juan de las Roelas --" The meeting of St. Elizabeth and the Madonna" (530)and his owII portrait(529)-derive their interest for us, we confess, chiefly from the fact that their .author was the master of Zurbaran (A.D. 15981662), the painter p'i- exccdlence of the Spanish Friar, as Velasquiez was of the Spanish Caballero, -and Murillo alike of the Spanish Beggar Boy and ihe Spanish AMadonna. There are no fewer than six -pictures of Zurbaran here; among them one of his characteristic " Queens of Heaven" (778) (contributed by Mr. Stirling), crowned, with clasped lands, and encircled by cherubs; but in the surrounding glory, and in the principal figlure, equally 1acking the splendour of colour and the earthly loveliness with which .murillo invests the same subject. This picture may be compared with that by the same hpainter on the same subject (793), contributed by Lord Elcho. The " Standing figure of St. Francis" -(790), from the collection of Mr. Hoskins, is the grim dark monk with which the name of Zurbaran is for ever associated, though this example has not the ecstatic fervour of the kneeling St. Francis of the Wational G lery. The " St. Peter" (2°8) of Francisco Herrera (LD. 1576-16506) is a good illustration of the daring, -dashimg manner, of that impetuous painter, the first teacher of Velasquez. When he had driven all his pupils out of his studio by blows and curses he ,.,ed, it is said, to employ his servant girl to smear oun the colour, which he afterwvards modelled into his coarse impasto and vigorous light and shade. It is to be lamented that there should be no example here of the second master and father-in. law of Velasquez-Pacheco. It would have been -curious to see what inference could be drawn from his works as to the influence on Valasquez of the instructions of this learned painter, one of the earliest Spanish writers on the theory of his art, a Familiar of the Inquisition, and one of the censors -of painting appointed by that awful body. The only work of the deaf and dumb Navarrete here is his own portrait (2]6), showing but little of that power gained by the studv of years in all the chief schools of Italy, whieh gave so many moble pictures to the Escurial in 1571, and which .five years later did not shrink from undertaking a -commission for 32 large pictures for a single church in Madrid, of which the painter lived to finish -only eight. In this portrait there is something of tbat blunt and heavy character of feature geneTally observable in the deaf and dumb. Of Morales 4(A.D.lffO9--1586), one of the most intensely devotional in expression of the Spanish school, we have ere, a" Pieth" (ffO8), in which emaciation and otiffnas of tha figures are united vwith much both of leauty and tenderness in the faces, and a " Head of Our SaWviour " (801), which is not inferior in painting or expression to any version of the same subject even by Murillo. With a deep expression of resignation, there is nothing in this head of the wanness and weariness which stamps on most of the works of Morales so peculiar and recognizable character. We now come to one of the two real champions of: Spanish art, Diego Rodriguez de Silva y Velasquez, whose biography has been so elaborately and g4nially written by Mr. Stirling. Thanks to Mr. Stirling's volume, we can trace the painter step by step through bis whole career. Born at Sevillet in 1599, of gentle blood, the passion for painting showed itself in Velasquez from his boyish days. From the daring, rough and ready school of I Herrera the painter passed to tho timid tuition of the learned Pacheco. The cold conventionality of the second master no more checked the vigorous genius of Velasquez than the coarseness of his earlier teacher had taught bim contempt for close and accurate rendering of facts. He left the rules and methods of both studios for the school of nature, devoted himself to constant study of a model who wvas at the same his servant, painted pots and -pan fish and.] fruit, game and vegetables from the market-place,1 the peasants who sold them, the water-carrierstand muleteers of the Feria, the beggars and gipsies of the Trisna. It would have been highly valuable for this period of the painter's career could we have had bere the Duke of Wellington's picture of thevendorof agua fresca, serving outthe coolcontents of hisbrown jars to a couple of tbirsty boys. The " Adoration of the Shepherds," in the National Gallery, illustrates another direction of the early studies of Velasquez towards imitation of Ribera, of which more traces are observable in the later style of the painter than of the influences of either of his Sevilisan masters. He himself always acknowledged obligations to Luis Tristan, the favourite pupil of El Greco. While still a student at Seville, Velasquez married the daughter of Pacheco, who survived her husband only a few days. He was 23 years old when in 1622 he first visited the court of Philip IV., then a youth of 18, in the second year of his reign. We have no record of the Kieg's having sat to the young painter on this his first appearance in the capital. felasquez remained only a few months in Madrid at this time, returning to Seville and his family. A. year elapsed before he again visited Madrid,-this time in odedience to a snmmons from Olivarez, thefavourite and Prime Minister of the King. Immediately on his arrival he painted the portrait of his friend and first patron, Don Juan Fonseca, Usher of the Curtain to Philip. The same evening it was finished the portrait was carried to the Palace, seen by the King and his brothers, and the painter was straightway received into the Royal service vwith a mnonthly salary of 20 ducats. Henceforwar1l his pencil was devoted to the commemoration of the King, his wives, his brothers, his children, and his nobles. Succesively Painte;r in OrdL-;ary, Usher, Gentleman of the King's Chamber. Quartermaster General of the King's Household, Knight of Santiago, and his time was divided between painting, travelling to collect works of art for the Royal galleries, and the labo. rious duties of his last office, which required him to provide quarters for the King and his retinue on the Royal progresses. It was during his first year's residence at Madrid that Prince Charles and BuckinRhani paid their romantic visit to the Court of Spain, and the oung Prince sat to the young painter. Our readers may remember the litigation between the trustees of Lord Fife and Mr. Snare, a bookseller of Reading, on the subject of a portrait maintained by the latter to be the very portrait of Charles painted at this time. It is not easy to enumerate the portraits of Philip IV. from the pencil of Velasquez. In this exhibition there are two, besides two of the Minister Olivarez, three of the Infante Balthazar Carlos, one of the first andI one of the second Queen of Philip, and one of the Cardinal Infant Don Ferdinand of Austria. Some of them may be repetitions or copies by the painters scholars-perhaps by Carrenio or Antonio Puga. Thanks to Velasquez, there are few regal physiognomies better known than the stolid, heavy, impassive face of Philip IV. One can understand, after studying the ful-length (728), here hung near his first Queen and his Minister, the accredited story that he was only known to smile thrice in his life. Impassiveness is the one characteristic of the face, with its lacklustre blue eyes, always star-gazing, heavy jaw, and projecting Austrian lip. Velasquez, Court painter as he was, certainly never flatters HIis MIajesty. Whether it is the King standing in his closet, or, booted and fowlingpiece in hand, engaged in his favourite amusement of shooting (779), or caracolling on his Andalusian horse,-young or middle-aged, in business, or pleasure, or war-we always see the same immovable, inexpressive, deadalive physiognomy. Nor was the painter's pencil more gallant to the Queens of Philip than it was courtly to the King. His portrait of Isabella, Philip's first wife (738), as we see it here, scarce bears out the lady's reputation for beauty. And the second Queen, Mariana, in the sketch of her here (628), is absolutely hideous, owing in some degree to the thick plaster of ronge and the grotesque frizzed out locks of that ugliest of all fashions-the Spanish Court style of 1650. " Olivarez" (737) is a masterly portrait of this ambitious, unprincipled Minister. It must have been painted before his fall inl143, andthree duplicates of it are known; one formerly in the King of Holland's collection, another in the Louvre, and a third lately in the possession of Mr. Farrer. The one here (from the gallery of Colonel Hugh B3aillie) is little, if at all, interior to the first-mentioned and best of the four. And what a model of unaffected, manly portraiture it is. The Count Duke stands before us in a plain black dress, with the green cross of the Order of Calatrava on his breast, one hand on his sword hilt, the otherresting on the table and holding erect a long slender liding-rod-a badge, perhaps, of the Minister's office of Master of the Horse. It is impossible to conceive a work with less of painter's trick or invention; the hand on the swordhilt is allowed to sway the sword up under the cloak, at an angle which by every painter's rule should be ungraceful, but which is not here felt to mar the charm of the natural and easy attitude; and the riding-rod held perpendicular is equally opposed to the received rules of pictorial arrangement. But who perceives these in presence of this life-life presentment of a man-keen, selfpossessed, ruthless, inscrutable? It is one of the most formidable pictures ever painted. Here, too, we have an admirable study, contributed by Lord Elgin, for the celebrated equestrian portrait of the same Minister, in the Royal Gallery at Madrid. In that great picture the horse is bay instead of gray as in this study. The Count-Dulke in balf-armour, a broad-leafed beaver on his head, sits truncheon on thigh, looking round out of the picture while his stallion caracoles as if eager to mingle in the battle, of which the smoke rolls up in the background. The two portraits of the King and his brother in shooting dresses (779 and 785) are repetitions, if not copies, of the same subjects in the Royal Gallery at Madrid. They are in the earlier manner ofthe painter before his journey to Italy had made nun acquainted with the master-works of Florence, Venice, and Rome. Both of these pictures are in bad condition, but enough remains to show the admirable ease and naturalness of the action, and what is left of the dogs may give an idea of the master's great power as an animal painter. We cannot find any record of the personage whose portrait hangs between the Royal brothers. He is called in the catalogue " Henri de Hamale," a Flemish seigneure, as we infer from the name I no less than from the bluff, jolly character of face and figure. He has just dismounted from his heavy gray Flemish horse, which a servant is leading ofl. The picture is a thoroughly manly version of a manly subject, painted with a robust carelessness and easy certainty of hand that reminds one of Rubens. Here, too, from the Duke of Bedford's gallery, is one of the two known portraits of Don Adrian Pulido Pareja (727), Knight of Santiago and Adniral of the Fleet of New Spain. The other is in Lord Radnor's collection. We do not find in this picture the signature of the painter and the date of 1639, which would aathenticate this as the very portrait of the stalwart admiral which is said to have deceived Philip, who, seeing the picture as it stood in a dark corner of the painter'es tudio, took it for the admiral himself in the flesh, and sternly reprimanded him for not having joined the fleet. God help heretic or native who should fall into Don Adrian's hands in his government of New.Spain I Bluff,brutal,beetle-browed--truncheoa aud M-Oer in hand, the sails of his galleons crowding the sea behind- him -he looks the -very impersonationi of the Elizabethan English conception of the-Spaniard, as the bloody.minded{1 persecutor of the Protestant and the ruthlel oppresr of the Indian. Before this picture one feels indeed what a necessity. lay upon this painterto represent the very man who sto d before hin-connely or coarse, brutal or benevolent, without fear or favour. Velasquez was worthy to have painted Cromwell. Another of his works of inimitable character and unshrinking conscientiousness here is the faUlllength called " The Alcalde Ronquilla"' (804), from the collection of Mr. Hoskins, an honest-looking, somewhat red-nosed old man, in a black dress. This consummate work was brought from Spain by Sir David Wilkie. Here, too, from the King of Holland's collection (contributed by Mr. Brett), is a charming full-length of a bright-haired, bright-eyed little lady in green satin, with a feather fan in her dimpled hand (786), one of the meninas or Maids of Hionour of the Infanta, as Mr. Stirling conjectures, and reminding one irresistibly of Rubens in manner as well as mastery of painting. Then here are-three porrais -of the Infanta Balhazar Carlos, son of Philips by his first queen,-one from the. Marquis. of Hertfozid's, showing the child at the age of four, scarce able to toddle under the weight of the steel gorget alreadyencircling the poor little neck (10); another, from Colonel Baillie's collection, a half-length, in black and silver, taken apparently about four years later (626) ;and the third (also in the Hertford Gallery) (11), as a boy of 12, in cuirass, crimson scarf, and plumued beaver, gallopping on a bay pony. This masterly sketch was formerly in the possession of ]r. Rogers and there is a repetition-of it on a sraaUer scale at Dulwich. The ori nal picture, life-size, isinthe Royal Gallery at Madrid. The Inquisition sternly prohibited the Spanish painterfrom all mythological nudities. One of ihe few works showing that the artist sometimes dared to brave the Holy Office is the " Venis " of Velasquez (1079), contributed by Mr. Moritt, who purchased the picture by advice of Sir Thomas lwrence, when it found its way to this couutry after the War of Independence. -In such work Velasquez wil not bear comparison with Titian, eitber in the painting of gesh or of the draperies employed to enhance its effect. Of his treatment of sacred subjects the II St. John" (795) is a not very satisfactory example. His powers as a landscape painter are indicated rather than vouched -by two small but suggestive sketches with figures, contributed by Mr. Stirling (624 and 625), and reminding ns of similar memoranda at Bowood. As a portrait painter Velasquez takes rank among the very first of his brethren, by the side: of Titian and Tiptoret, Rubens, Vandyke, and Reynolds. By -none of these have men and women been more vigorously or honestly paint9d. Indeed, we do not know if in the quality of honesty Velasquez should not be set above al the pain.ers we have named. Of his pupil Carreno there is here an excellent example, a full length of Charles II., the weak and sickly successor of Philip (739), in his boyhood. After Velasquez, Murillo is perhaps more satisfactorily represented in this Exhibition than any other single master. The rich galleries of Lord Hertford and Lord Overstone, Mr. Stirling and Miss Burdett Coutts, have aU furnished choice examples, and Mr. Miles, Lord Elcho, Mr. W. Wells, Mr. Anderson, Mr. Burdon, Mr. Darby, Earl Spencer, and Mr. W. Marshall, M.P., have also sent works of this great painter. Born at Seville in 1617, of poor parents, whose relationship to the painter Juan de Castillo enabled them to place in his well-frequented school their son, whose bent for art declared itself -in childhood, Bartolom6 Estevan Murillo found himself at two-and-twenty compelled, on the departire of his master to Cadiz in 1639, to earn his bread by painting slight daubs for the Feria, or Thursday market, held in front of the church of All Saintswat Seville. At this sorry work he managed by 1642 to save enough to defray the cost of a journey to Italy, the pilgrimage of every Spanish painter who could scrape the means for it together, and on his way, halting at Madrid, ventured to knock at the door of his townsman, Velasquez, then in the full flushof fame and Court favour. Valesquez. saw and que3tioned the young painter, received him into his oWn house, and opened to him the Royal galleries. Here he worked for two years and in 1645, instead of pursuing his journey to Rome, returied to Seville, which he never afterwards quitted) closing there his happy, honoured, and laborious life in 1682, in the midst of his children, his scholars, and his friends. There have been few less eventful or more lovely lives in the history of art than Murillo'a, andte nd Christian character of the mau seems to be reflected in his pictures. His noblest works were those executed for charitable and religious foundations, and he seems never to have been so happy as when devoting his pencil to some enforcement of the great Christian cause of peace upon earth, goodwill towards men. Those great achievements of his hand, which once fiUled the Hospital of Charity, the Cathedral, the Franciscan Convent, andthe Hospitalfor Superannuated Priests, at Seville, of course attracted the arch-plunderers Soult and Co. during the French occupation of the Peninsula. Many were carried off; one of them, which, to the shame ofthe allies, the plunderers were allowed to retain, is now in this Exhibition,-the "St. Giles in Ecstasy before Pope Gregory IX." (620), stolen by Fabvier, aud now the property of Mr. Philip Miles. Here, too, is a sketch of a woman drinking (629), no doubt a study for one of the groups in his great picture of " Moses Striking the Rock" in the Hospital of Charity. It is pleasant to stand before the two admirable portraits of Murillo here, the one (Mr. Marshal's) representing him at about 30, soon after his return from Madrid, the otber (Lord Spencer's) painted, as he has recorded in the picture, expressly to preserve his memory among his children, and in performance of a vow. Both are noble portraits, but the second, especially, shows that had not the painter's pious and loving character kept him to the ilustration of God's dealings with man, as set forth in the New Testament and the legends of the church, he might have contested with Velasquez the palm of Spanish portraiture. There is even a completer revelation of character in the face, and a more delicate cunning of hand, in this portrait than in any we have ever seen of Velaaqpez-something which reveals a higher and deeper nature, such as all we know of Murillo's life leads us to infer his to have been. 'We have not space to do more than rapidly direct attention to the principal among some 30 pictures of the painter here shown. First in excellence among them aUlis the "' Nativity and Adoration of the Shepherds," from Lord Hertford's collection (1), in which, with a homely Spanish conception of the whole subject, is combined the intensest and truest reverence in the shepherds-especially in one old man, with hands crossed on his breast, at the foot of the mangerand the most simple and serene loveliness in the Virgin Mother. In point of technical skill nothing of Murillo?s here equals the group round the Divine Child, and the child itself. Here, too, is a fine picture of Murilo's subject of predilection "The Charity of St. Thomas of Villanueva" (2)- so often painted by him with variations of tirelatment. Here, also, is the picture of "Joseph sold by his Brethren" (3), full of dramatic expression, with an " Assumption of the Virgin" (4), and a "I Holy Family" (5), both possessing the painter's merit of a pure and tender, if homely, conception of his subject. Instead of regarding it as a reproach to Murillo that in these works, and in the many others of similar scenes and incidents here exhibited-as the "Flight into Egvpt" (643), Mr. Staniforth's "Holy Family" (639), where Joseph is giving the child to his mother, and she looks up to receive tho beloved burden with such exquisite maternal yearning-the painter took as models for his personages the peasants round about him, we rather would contend that this fact is evidence of the genuine, truthful, unconventional nature of the man. For, homely as these heads are, there is no coarseness in them-nothing in this Virgin to render her unworthy to be the mother of the Saviour, nor in this St. Joseph, that he should be umfit to bear the blessed babe in the rough nursing of his hard hands. How Murillo could enshrine tenderness in this common humanity, let that lovely little sketch of St. Joseph embracing the infant Saviour (635) bear witness. How he could rise to the conception of the Man of Sorrows let those saywho feel the tears rise to their eyes before that meek head of the Saviour (623), in which serenity and suffering are se tenderly attempered. We are quite ready to rest the question of Murillo's fitness to treat sacred subjects-even the highest that Holy Writ can furnish-up. thle pictures of his here exhibited. And if his reputation for versatility Buffer by the ablence from this gallery of any of those Deggarboys or gipsy girls with whose picturesque raggedneu and hungry enjoyment the name of Murillo is associated in so manyminds, we cannot feel sorry, seeing that it leaves us to the unmarred influencea of his sweeter and higher nature. It wouldbe a hard heart that could learn to know Murillo here without loving him. The Exhibition of Art Treasures was the centra of a series of attractions yesterday, which drew together a great number of people. At 12 o'clock there was a review of troops by Lieutenant-General Sir Harry Smith, in honour of Her Majesty's birthday, at Old Trafford, including the 7th Dragoon Guards, the 25th Regiment of infantry, and two companies of Pensioners. The troops were. put through a number of evolutions, and at the conclusion Sir Harry Smith addressed Colonel Bentinck in complimentary terms on the appearance and efficiency of the men. Next came a floral and horticultural fitc at the Botanic Gardens, and, a very considerable portion of the conmpany baving previously asembled at the Alt Treasures xhibition, availed themselves of the entrance totha gardens; fromzthat building. The weather was fine, and the two Exhibitions aiding each other brought together a very large assemblage. The u h6rticultural exhibition is the finest that has 1eihaps ever been held in the gardens, and besides plint* contributed bythe Dukeof Sutherland from Trentham-ball, and by othbr noblemen- and gentlemen in the neighbourhood,' there were some splendid collections sent by Messrs. Lucombe, Pince, and Co., from Exeter, and by Mr. Skirving, of Liverpool...
COLOGNR CEROBAL UNION. Another visit from this celebrated choir of male voioes under the auspices of Mr. MitchelL could hardly fail] to excite the interest of all lovers of Tocal part-music, and the brilliant audience that thronged the Hanover-square Rooms at the first concert, on Monday afternoon, was no more than what every one had anticipateL .Mr. Mitchell has engaged the Rhenish minstrels for a fortnight, at the expiration of which term their return to the city of the Three Kings is indispensable; so that it behoves all who are desirous of enjoying the treat presented by their wonderfully finished performances to lose no time.1 The Cologne singers are neither better nor worse than vwlen we last heard them; and, indeed, it would be as dif'. qult for them to improve a it would be unlikely ior thelm to retrograde. Their precision is the same; their perfect management of the gradations of tone, their command bf sudden transitions trom loud to soft and vice eversd, their provoking unanimity, are just as were described before, anid created the same union of pleasure and surprise in the audience. The fact is that the members of the'choir aie always practisng together, and by this means are enabled to reach a degree of excellence attainable in no other way. A more able and vigilant director than Herr Franz Weber it would be hopeless to seek; and how mueh of the credit attuched to the performances is due to the ereful training, unflagging zeal, and nice musical discrimination of this gentleman we need notsa7. I It is strange that with such elements as are offerdd throunhout the length and breidth of Germany by the choral societies- of which there is one: or more in almoit every town, great and small-the art of composing.artsongs for voices should be in a declining state. Such, however, is the case, and the programmes of the society nol under notice afford abundant proof that there is not much of that solid stuff in the compositions of living writers which helps to make good mtisic From Weber and 3endelssobn to Kreutzer, Otto, Kilcken, and the like there is a terrible distance, and, unhappily, little or nothing be tween. It would, we think, be wise on the part of the Cologne Choir, or at lesat show a consideration for the advancement of genuine music, to discard some of the r and weak effuasins of later times in favour of the old Itlian and IEnglsh madrigals or English glees (those of Bishop especially). Such a policy would materially enrich their repertory, and in a great measure revive that vigorous and manly tone for which the German liedertafel was once preenminent, but which, for some reason or other, it has been gradnally losing. Serenades, bell-songs, danee-ballads, &o., are-all very well now and! then; but why a surfeit of them? The choral unions were surdy instituted for a nobler putr pose, and though the expression of political feelint, even through the medium of song, may be stifled ampng t e Teutonic nations, there is an inexhaustible vein of poetry yet to be opened-poetry which, wedded to musio worthy of its might serve the ends of art and civlization a thousad tiues better than such petty trling as has recently becomethe node. We are enemles to everything that aims at effect tbrough the agency of trickery, or which seeks to grAtify vulgar and uneducated minds at the expense of what is dmple, dignified, and true; and7woe have remarked with pain a owing tendency towards such puerile subterfue where to seta good example is a bounadei duty. Art is a sacred thing, or it is nothing. If itsmiseion be not to reine, it may be to debase, nd the really great men, will then havelivedin vain, snce the' have worked with a wholy opposite end in view. Nothing is easier than to create a puerile taste, and afterwards pander to it; but, if in places where art has a right to be fostered and cherished we fnd it ministering to triviity and clap-trap, what can be expected elsewhere? A glance atthe series of progranmes which the MUannea-Gesang.Y-Vcren of Cologne-one of the most eminent in Germany-is announced to performn has unavoidably led to these reflections. Year ater year only goes to prove that while executive art is progressing the creative power is on the wane. The deduction. is a sad one, but it is the duty of all who hold nusic in esteem to weigh the probable conseanences and endeavour to trace the origin of a fallingoff so much to be lamented. Is it that, in our admiration for the excellence of performers, we are beginning to lose all consideration for the merits or demerits of that which is to be performed? It is much to be feared that this is the caPe ; and, if so, what must eventually become of art ? We will make bold to say tha no company of English gleesingers assembled together for public exhibition conld ever, by any possibility, have made a selection out of more trivial materials than that which this magnifLcent choir offered to an English public yesterday afternoon as a specimen of modern German art. " hMnheer Van Dunck" or The Chough and Crow" would have been a godsend. To attempt a description of the ballads in verses, serenades, &c., of MM. Kilcken, Otto, Becker, Schirtlich, Girachner, Silcher, Reichardt, Koliner, and others, of which the programme consisted, would be simRly a loss of time and a waste of space. With the exception of one single piece, by a composer who never did anything to authorize his being named in such society, there was scarcely one part-song of the slightest musical value, and yet upon all this barren emptiness was brought to bear an executivetalent bordering upon the marvellous. The choral singing, as of old, was vastly superior to the solos-which, in KlUcker's " Jungen hlusikanten," where the quartet was damaged by the false intonation of the upper voice, in Schbirtlich's " Mein Wunsch," where the tenor solo would have done little credit to l-r. Henry Leslie's (English) choir, and in the so-called " Spanish Canzonet" of Reichardt (which has about as much of Chinese as of Spanish in character), where the barytone, though correct, might have been better without any great demand upon the resources of the Cologne choir, left much to be desired. In all other respects, however, the performance was magnificent - and, trifling as was the music in the abstract, no one conid possibly object to the "encore" that greeted the termination of Silcher's " Drei Roslein " which commences very much in the same strain as the old English baUad, " Where are you going, my pretty maid?" True, the audience had already heard the same phrase six times over (since, in spite of the artifices of the singers-who attempted, not unsuccessfully, to obtain viriety by giving one stanza soft, another loud ; one stanza quick, another slow-every verse is precisely the same); bat so magically perfect was tho execution that the repetition of the last three verses afforded unquaUfied pleasure. Of pure vocal part -singing we had scarcely an example. Two pieces, however, by no means universally known, appeared in favourable contrast with the mass of commoaplaces by which they were surrounded-viz, Girschner's " Bilte dich," and Kilcken's "Derk leine Rekrut," both of which, the first especially, possess marked and individual character. The audience was not what the director of the Musical Union, in his peculiar jargon, terms "demonstrative " but there was an evidence of quiet enjoyment that could not be mistaken. The very last notes of the choir were heard with attention; and had there been a dozen pieces more we believe the majority would bave remained to the end. Such is the charm invariably attached to faultless execution. Two pianoforte displays varied the performance-a curious fantasia based upon some of the popular themes in Mleyerbeer's Prophte, and an "arrangement" of the march from Mendelssohn's 3iclsmnea-r Njht's Drcana The composer and the executant to boot was 31 Loais Bras3i, member of the society-a young artist who ciQ boast of considerable mechanical proficiency, if of nothing else. About his music the less said the better.
BOROUGH OF FALIMOUTH Ma-D PEiRmHYx.-On Saturday a writ was received for the election of a membs r for this borough, rendered vacant by tbe appointment of Mr. Thomas G. Baring as a Lord of the Admiralty. The nomination has been fixed for Wednesday, the 27th, and no opposition is likely to occur to Mr. Boring's re-election, altbough a report is in circulation that a requisition hLs been sent to Mlr. Gwvn, in Wales, solicitinig his araia offering himself. If a poll should be demanded it will be taken on Thursday. THE CROPS iN = W sV.-The weaeher of late has been favourable for the growing crops, which in every part of DevoDshire are exceedingly promising. The wheat and barley present a most healthy and luxuriant appear. ance, and grass is abundant in the pastuTe felds. Potatoes have como up vigorous and healthy, and largo quantities have been sown this year. If the season continues favonrable there is every prospect of a bountiful harvest. The apple crop in Devonshire was a total failure last year, which has been much felt in the county, in consequence of the large quantity of cider which is made for exportation and home consumption by the labouringpopulbtion. This year, however, there is every likelihood of an abundant crop. The cold weather in the early spring gave a wholesome check to the bud, but the genial weather of the last fewr weeks ha caused the apple trees to blossom most luxuriantly. Tho fruit in many orchards has set well and, with a oontinuance of recent fine weather, the bearing of apples throughout the oounty will, in all probability, be larger than has be known for sevqi4 yeams
THE PUBLIC &rXALT,. (From t*bA&gistrar.Gueral's We.kly Retum) Thb mean temperature of the air during the last fortnight bas been 14 dog. higher than that of four weeks preceding. and the salutary, effect of the chAnge is distincily aeen in the present return. The weekly deaths registered in London had been, in Apriland in two -weeks of May, generallyabove 1,050; in the week that ended on Saturday the number was 948. In the ten years 1847-56 the averap number of deaths in the sweeks corrssponding with last week wis 1,007. But a-3 the deaths of last weekoccurred in an increased populatibr, it is necessary, with a viewto compaison, to raise the average in proportion to the increase, whereby it will become 1,108. The deaths of last week were lees by 160 than the number which would have occurred under the average rste of mortality in the third week of May. In some recent returns it was seen that the deaths attri. buted to diseases of theo-organs of respiration were about 200; a warmer teonperature reduoed them last week to 167. The average derived from corresponding weeks in previous yeas is wh.n corrected nearly the same-namely, 1¢5. Fatal cases of bronchitis declined in the last two week from 102 to 84; those of pneumonia from 75 to 66. The deaths cganted by zymotio diseses,declineilin the same period-from 194 to 168, and the mortality oft4his class is unumuallyloJv, for the average is 253. A third purt of the deaths enumerated under this head- was caused by hooping cough, which carried off 56 children. Typhus (includiag common fever), which at this period in former yeJrs usuas y carried off about 50 persons, Was fktal last week o 33. Scarlatina and smallpox exhibit a imarced deocreA4; the former was fatal in only 12 cases, the latter in onl; one, which occurred inafamily in Somers-town, in which four children were attacked, none of them having been vaccinated before one ohild had discovered symptoms of thy disest Agirl of 16 months die' of "varioella,psja monis," in Princess-street, Marylebone. No lees than eigt persons died from.syphilitic diease, at agea varying fNrmone )0onth to 67 years. Two persons died of intemperanje. The oldest person recorded in this week's returns is X canteunarin, who is stated to have lived to the age of 102 yeats. She was a widow, and died on the 17thof May, at 5, Quepa Elizabeth'sCollege, Greenwich. A carpenter died on t)se 16th at 6, Golden's-place, Lambeth, at the age of 79 yeans, who is repsrted to have been a great-grandson of Defoe. Last eek the births of 5boys and 748 g inr all 1,633 children, were registered in London. In the ten cor e sponding weeks of the years 1847-56 the average number was 1,489. At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean height of the barometer in the week was 29-706 in. The barometcr was at its highest point-29S96 in.-atthe beginning of.tha week, and fell to 29-36 in.at the end of it. The mean tem-l perature of the week was 589 deg., which is 5-3deg. above the average of the same week in 43 years (as determined be 3Mr. Glaisher). The mean temperature was above the average onevery day eept Friday, andon the firsttwo days the excesswasabout9deg. Thehigheattemperture occArred on 3ronday, andwas 79 deg.; the lowestalsoocurred on thit day, and was 4b deg., giving a range df 34 deg. The mean due point temperature of the week was 505 deg., and tie difference between this and the mean temperature of the air was 8-4 deg. The Wind blew on every day from t6se south-west till Friday afternoon, when it changed to nor4ieast. Rain amounting to 0 35 in. fell on the last two days. None fell on any of the previous days, with the exceptfln of some light showers on Thursday. (From the General Board of Health.) RBSE AND DECZIa OF DISEAS..-CpOMprjL PtROX T}m DISTRICT RLZTURNS, WITH RMARc Br CONWAY EVAwS, XB., LONDON. ; The institutions from which returns were received forthe week ending Saturday, May 16, are, with two or threo exceptions, the same as those by which information was sua. plied the preceding week, They consist of 27 workhousos, the outdoor poor of 33 districts and sab-districts, 9 general hospitals, 5 special hospitals and asylums, 27 dispensaries, 15 lunatic asylums, 1 lying-in hospital, 1 school, 1 military asylum, 1 prison, and lhospital for foreigners. In these institutions there came under treatment during the past week no fewe9than 6,685 new cases of disease. Of these 6,685 ne1Wcases of disease 1,057 oecurred in tbe west diviaion of London, 2,224 occurred in the north division, 1390 in the central division, 831 in the east division, and 1,183 in the soath division. In the 27 workhouses 392 new casee came under treatment; among the outdoor poor of tho 33 districta and sub-district 2,055new cases; in' t4e 9 generalhospitals 2,516; in the 5 special hospitals a4d Asylums 161; andin the 28 dispensaries 1,419, The weather, which had lately been remarkably cold for the time of year, became uxusually warm during the p4t week. The wind, which had been almost constantly in tl e north-east, changed ain the early part of th, week to tl e Vouth; and during the last days blewfrom the south-west aud west, The rise in temperature commenced in the lattor. part of the previous week. It increased steadily, anrd, Saturday Was a very warm day, the thermometers having stood above "summer heat." The nights, however, webe comparatively old, and consequently the daily ranges 6f temperature were great. At Greenwich - the thermometer oseto 80 dog. on Saturday, having stood at 39 dog. tl,e preceding Suaday; thus giving a weekly range of 4. deg. At St. Thoma,'a Hospital the weekly range was only 29 dg. (74 deg.-45 deg.) The mean batometric pressure wgs 29-876 in. At Hackney the air was much drier than jt the other stations, and the amount of ozone observed thezte was unusually large. There were showers the first throe days of the week, bat the quantities of rain collected at the several stations varied considerably. Thus, at St. Thomas's IIospital the amoant which fell was *33 in., while at Iacknoy it was only -10 in. At Fulham a little thander, accompanied with rain and hail, occurred on Monday afternoon. It is interesting to remark that the quantity of water flowing down the streams which supply London appears to te rapidly diminishing, as evidenced by the results of obFervations on the river Lea. Bronchitis and catarrh continue to decrease, the total number of new cases of these diseases being less by 51 than that registered the previous week (543 as compared with 594). This decline will probably be more marked during the next week or fortnight, if the present warm weather should continue. - Of smallpox 11 cases are recorded. It is remarkable (as, indeed, happened also last week) that more than two-thirds of the entire number occurred in the northern districts, and more than one-third (4) in the parish of St. Marylebone. The number of cases of chickenpox, as coumpared with the preceding week, has nearly doubled (21 against 11), the principal increase having taken place in the central and eastern districts. eMeasles is slightly on tbe decline, the total number being less by 13 than that returned the previous week. This -alady prevails at the present moment to a considerable extent in the eastern portion of the Strand district. Bjch scarlatina and whoopingcough exhibit a decided increase in all thb divisions of London, the former having risen from 25 to 43, the latter from 92 to 122. Diarrhoea is also on the rise, 22 cases having occurred this week in excess of the number registered the preceding week. The officer of health for Marylebone states that a case of diarrhoea, " accompanied with vomiting and cramps," occurred during the week in a patient of the St. John's-wood Free Dispensary, and that a similar case came under treatment at that institution the previous week. Respectingthoother diseases enumerated in the tables but little variation has taken place in the numbers registered, except in the ease of pneumonia and rheumatic fever, both of w ich maladies, as might have been expected, show a marked decrease. Of the 52 cases of ague recorded this week nearly half (23) came underetreatment in the districts south of the Thames.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In your paper of the 18th inst., under the head of Naval and 3tilitary Intelligpnce," a sbort notice was given of the Abbe Pauvert's invention for making steel. but, as that account was scarcely specific enough to enable the publio to judge of the importance of the discovery, perhaps, with your accustomed liberality, yoa will allow me to add the following particulars. The Abbe Pauvert, after long and laborious researches into the nature of iron and its varied combinations with carbon, has found that in order to obtain differejit quali. t:ts of stecl from iron regard must be had not only to tho purity of the iron and the quantity of carbon cemlbined with it, but also to the mode in *vhich the carbon exiting in the II on enters into combination with it, and to the mainuer in which crystali2ation takes place. ]lL ooer, therefore, to obtain steel of superior quality from all kinds of iron manufactured by means of coke it vas indispensable to ascertain the manner of purifying the xr.z,n of regulating to a certainty its combiination with the carhon and itS cryatl lizacionw. Chaxt thu Abbe Pauvert has arrived at these results was ly attested by his experiments at the Royal Dockyard, The advantages of this invention may be gathered from the tollo wing facts:- Steel of superior quality has onlybbeen fabricated hi'therto fromn Swedish iron, which, according to the current prices of the day, costs between 141. lOs. and 161. lOs. per ton; whereas by the Abbe Panvert's process the same is procured from British forged pig iron, varying in prioe from 41. lOs. to 51. per ton; or even from old refuse or scrap iron. Theomanufacture of the steel does not require the sUig'test change in the actual arrangements of the smelting and cementing fnrnaces, orucibles, or other apparatus. 'The conversion of the metal is simply effected by chymical ingredienta and electric agency, at a cost not exceeding J1r s. to the ton, nor is there any lo.s of material whaterer as one ton of the worst iron yields one ton of rawr steel ' I have no doubt but the vast advantages of this wonderful discovery, 'chio has already been- brought into osperatio by the Messrs. do Beauchatup, M.

TI!E U.IZTXD ZINDOAMALT*NwrCZ A mneetin oft-the membi er4 frid e dU tho Ujldti ingclom Al ianoe "1 for the totl suppression of the li'r traffic" was held last er.ening at Ert&er halh It lad fiee announced that the Hon. Kel' Dow, ef' `ortlaud. A4;in would address the meeting, aud at the time fixed for tb; commencement of the proceedings th.e lare room was filled by anaudienoeconsistdigingres put of member of the gentler sex. In the absence of Mr. E. Ball, M.P:E., who had peoiss4 to preside over the meeting, the chair was taken by the Hon.. Judge Marshall, of Nova slcotia, who, in opeuing the proceedings, saidthat the onilymeans of freeingEnisanc± fromthe scourge of intemperance which afflicted ocietr throughout the length and breadth of the land was to eaae a law prohibiting the traffic in intoxicting liquos (Cheers.) The Rev. Dr. BuwNs moved a resolution welcoming the Hon. Neal Dow, and expressing confidenoe in him,ns, a statesman and a social reformer. The resolution was seconded by Mr. BEGGS, sepporte: by the Earl of HARUIN GTON, and carried by acclamation the audlieace riing audeheeing most heartily and enthusiasti- The Hon. Nts.L Dow. whose riuing was the signal for & renewral of the cheers, thanked the meeting for ehe enthusiastic reception which they had given to him, and which he took as an erneet of their sympathy with the c which he dvocated and'atestimony of the good feSll entertained .by the people of England towards thow of America. He asured them . that that feditng was, fally, reciprocated by his feUow-countrymen, who considered themselves the brothers of the peopl6 of England. (Cheers.) The temperace reform was of in6lnite importance to the honour and glory of 'England an4 so tbe welfare of her people. Why was it necemsary to argue and strive for thatcause? -Because members of the inflaential classes generally kept themselves aloof f;vom it. Moutn the appearance of the noble earl onthe ilatfor an he area that this cause would before long triumph in England, Th. reason why the influential clamses did riot keneraly jo'm this movement was not that they"were indifferent to the welfare of their fellow subjects, but that it involved-personal acrifioes which they were unwilling to make. (Elesr, h*r'X At present member of Parliament did not know about this movement; buf the time woiual shon come when, taught by the votes of the people, the' would recognise its importance, in all countries, instanced o' great personal sacrifioee were to' be found'chiefly anorng the mniddling clase of society., in Maine the tempeane mnvement had boeen carried on almost excliuively by the middling and lower clas, nntil it becaule a questied of abolishing the trffc in intoxicating drinks. It wasresolved, to bring, it into, the political arena; and after a sere struggle -the people were taught to believe that this wa more important than all,otherqunestionsiof tbe day. So it. mnstbemEngland. Thisqueition was infinitely morel.. porent than all other political questions At the lest elc tion in this country much stress was laid upon a saving of, 6,000.000C., which it. was aid the, GCoverament migh; efect.- Tho suppression of, the liquor traffic would ave 75,000,0001. per annum in mone,. in addition to an equal saving in time; sv that the whole saving *ould amount to L50,00,000L In addition to this the- suppression of this traffic- would greatly increa and. improve sbe physncal strength of the nation. -And yet the memBers of Parliament did not know about it, (Cheers.) Unltes England put down the beershops, ibse. could not ret'ain'er position in relation to the. continental Po ! (Cbeers.) The grogshops slew 60,000 Englishmen every year-more than twice as many as fell in the Crimea ;ndu there were at this day more than 600,000 drankards, more than 600,000 starving women, and more than 1,00D 00m children growing up in vice and crime ci account of'the trifflo in intoxicating drinks. (Cheers.) With all this aginst the amount of this traffic what bonefit were they to set to its credit? The man did not-live who c^ould mention one single item. (Cheers.) Yet it 'was said ihat a &!ain Law for England was impossble, and that the Gbvernment would hold fast by beershops and gisshogs! Unless the beer"bops were suppress in England. America wounld outstrip her in the race for naional wealth, national honour, and national power. And wiy ? Because America, which had lost 3,000,000 and 30X000 men a-year by it, would put down this traffic. The statesmen attempted to resis" the movement, and the people put thon down. Let Englsh statesmentale warning by t t example. He predicted that before long the statesmen of this countrywould feel themselves driven to take oognizanoe of the demand for the legislative prohibition of thesaxle of intoxica. ting drinks. This was properly a political question.' It was said that the movement involved an interference 'with the rights of' the subject It did nothing of the kind. because the subject had no right to do, anything which ras inconsistent with the general good. Saits popzli suprzm. Zen. All laws wero founded on that principle. and that pnciple would equally justify this prohibition. There were both 'in E ngland and' Anerica laws that inen should not build housis except ipon certiin fixed cQuditions which wero necessarj' for the public good; and yet it was sid that we had no right to interfere with thedale of intoxicating drinks. o, also, in the cases of fire in Americs, the rightsof indiviauals were often sacrificed to thegen4ral good, A man's house wAs his castle so longas the genepl good permitted, but no farther. Among the most manificent buildings in England were those erected to take carer bf those 'who were ruined by the grogeops. These men had been deprived of their personal liberty, as some otWers were deprived of their live%s because their 'liberty or tHeir lives, as the case might be, wereinconsistentwith the puiluic goo; and wets with aU. thit, interference ifJith personal rghts it was said that we musi not touch a single grogn shop This 'trafic had about it the elenienteof a great crime,. The essence of crimw3as an intelferenoe with the general welfaro; and crimes 'were classed as less or greaer accordingasthey interfered moreorless with the general good. Once the slave trde was no crime in England cThe suppression of thatitrde irws at first declated by almost a the press and by the influential claes of England tobe impossible, but it was now-an accomplished fact. (Cheers.) Carrying on that trade was now a crime punisbable rhy death.. He did not hesitate to ssy that the traffio in intopxeating drinks interfered with the publi good more in one year than did all other crimes, marders, robberies, house burnings, and forgeries in a quarter of a century. -The remedy for this was, when the opinion of the people should be prepared for it. to enact a law for the snopression of this traffic, The objecet of this asqociation was to prepare public opinion for this change. We had already 39-fortieths of a Maine Law in England, becaus only 39 out of every 40 peoplo were licensed to sell intoxicating drinks. (Cheers.) This movoment was going on, and would go on, and when it reached the " dangerous classes," who were made so only by these liquorshops, the vroild be thefirst to demaud protection for themselves. "ere the traffic in intoxicating drinks abolished there would at alU times be food enough for all. He supposed that no one would deny that the people of England had a right to mike this question the test of voting for members of Parliament - but some might say that you could not make men sober;by Act of Parliament. That question was not involved in this movement; it went not to the drinking, but to the selling of in.oxicating drinks. He had no doubt tht a Maine law would bo passed in England. (Cheers.) 27he times had aid that in Maine this lquor law had been a failure. What were really tho facts? The law had suppressed both the wholesale and retail trade except in a few places, where it was carried on secretly. It had emptied' the gaols, almshouses, and watchhouses, and had removed from the streets to schools the swarms of children oF drunkards who infested them before this law was passed. It had greatly improved the condition of the working. classes; many of whom formerly spent their wages upoa drink, but who were now saved from that temptation, and expended their money upon houses, clothes, and land for their families. The law had been repealed in Maine. but that had occurred only in obedience to thb law under which moral progress was effected by alternate advance and retrogression. A political party which had for 30 years held power lost it in consequenceof their opposition to this law. At the election of the year before last that party formed an union with the strait Whigs, and abolished the Maine Law. They introduced a Icense system; the result was a revival of intenuperane and at the last annual election the people swept the Anti. Maine Law men from their places. (Loud cheers,) In New Hampshire and Rhode Island the Democratic party had 8ipposed this law, and had been in consequence crashed opt. in the constitution of Ohio there was a clause that there should be no license system in that State. In Michigan the Mdaine Liquor Law had been enacted by a popular vote. In Pennsylvania the enactment of a similar law had been prevented by a majority of only 4,000 votes; given by the German counties, and in Indiana there was an equally strong feeling in favour of such a measure. Could the Queen of England only see this question in the light in which it -was regarded by the members of this a-s suciation she might by her influence suppress the traffic'i. intoxicatin drinks, and might thus earn a loftier fame than that Roman Emperor who boasted that he found Rome built of brick and left it built of mlartle. Upon resuming his seat the hon. gentleman, who had been most attentively listened to throughout his address, received a fresh testimony of the sympathy and sdmiratit n of btis auditors, who rose from their eats and cheered Various resolutions erer adopted in support of the objects of the association, and the proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the chadtman.

ONDON, WEDNESDAY, MAY27, 1857. It may serve to show our neighbours the permanency of British institutions and the constancyof the national character that the Minister who moved the Army Estimates in 1809, when NAPOLEON was still in the height of his power and success, when the Duke of WELLINGTON was just commencing his career in the Peninsula, and before scarcely a living Sovereign in Europe was born, repeated the office last Monday. It must be added that Lord PAL1frssSTo exhibited even more than his youthful vivacity, and clothed the dry figures not only with bodily significance, but even with airy grace. The country, and the cause of representative institutions, are something to a man who can make his duty to them a labour of love, as Lord PAiiEPnsTox did in this instance, after half a century of incessant official and Parliamentary toil. Yet, when we have done full justice to this marvellous and gratifying speetacle, and to the immense efforts shown to keep up with the age, we are bouud to say that in the Secretary-at-War for 1809 we do not find all that wo expected in the explanation of the War stnimates for 1857. We do not challenge the' figures at present. We acquiesce for this year in 6,917 more men than in the year before the war; in 636,0001. more charge on the land force. We are glad to hear that after the recent reductions we have still a conniderable increase of Artillery and Engineers. We expectedto bear of some heavy remainders, or ominous demands for the defence of our arsenals, dockyards, and ports, and for more healthy and comfortable barracks,-these two iterns amounting to a quarter of a million; we were prepared for a large item for our new manufacturing establishments, and can testify to their beauty and apparent completeness. We do not expect our soldiers to be better clothed, better housed, better fed, better armed, better trained, or better cared for in respect of medicine, or a new arm of the service, such as the Transport Depart-' ment, to be added for nothing. Taking all things into account, we do not complain or wonder to hear that on the now united Estimates for Army, Ordnance, and Commissariatthere is an increase of more than a milion and a-half. We have already given our tribute to the resolution which has cut down the Estimates so low as they are,-lower than we and far lower than certain gentlemen in and out of Parliament expected them to be. Yet, after making these admissions, we must say that even that increase of expenditure would have been more readily complied with had it been more thoroughly explained; and, increase or decrease, we still want to be thoroughly assured that the army of 1857 is in a much more effective condition than the army of 1854. For instanco, we should like to have heard more as to the working of the great military experiment of the age-the "Camp " at Aldershott. Before the late war we had just made the discovery-a timely discovery, as it appeared to be-that our army had no training for field operations, that the officers could not handle large bodies of men, that the eoldiers had no idea of roughing it, and that altogether they would find real soldiering very different from what they expected. So we had Chobham, that grand military picnic, as it was called; and, had people's wits been at work, it migh' have suggested some hints for the Crimea. That experiment and the stern reality of war which succeeded were both so suggestive that we set to work in earnest and established a grand camp, or school for field operations, at Aldershott. Now, everybody knows how things am apt to grow, and to grow into something quite different, and we cannot help fearing it has been so in this instance. The " Camp," as it is still traditionally called ia maps and railway guides, is a wooden town, and, of course, a very bad town, as far as the structures are concerned. It is a vast aggregation of indifferent barracks in a verybleak situation, and out of the way, forgoodas well as for bad purposes. It answers no object thht a military town such as Potsdam, or the immense barracks at VersaiUes, would not equaUy answer. ln a word, disguise it not, Aldershott is a town, and there are certainly advantages in banishing our army to a Hampshire heath, as there were in sending our convicta to Dartmoor. But we should like to hear, on honest, official, and profesional authority, that the camp is doing the duty of a camp, and that all our army, all branches of the service, including, of course, the Commissariat, are learning the art of war. Are they marching across country, encamping, bivouacldhg occasionally, manceuvring, crossing streams, going out with three days' food and forage, cook'ng their own dinners, and otherwise rehearsing the duties and incidents of a campaign? We hear on all sides many complaints of Aldershott, but they generally proceed on the hypothesis that it is a town, and of course the most uncomfortable, inconvenient, and ugly one in the kingdom. Nobody complains that it is a bad' camp, for it is a very substantial one, and bids fair to become still more substantial. The truth is, like mere book scholars, we learn all our lessons in a very parrot-like fashion. Sebastopol dispelled a host of delusions, but we slavishly follow the letter of even that dreadful lesson. It was not a camp we pitched before the Russian stronghold; it was a town we built against it, like that which the Athenians built against Syraue, and on some other well-known occasions. So what do we do but go into the country and build a town, the very model of that we sent to the Black Sea. But what is more likely than that the first time the troops now at Aldershott shall be engaged on real service it will be in open country, or in forced marches, through difficult passes, hundreds of miles from ships, huts, stores, coals, canteens, hard roads, or anything to remind them of "Aldershott Camp V" But with respect to this and all other explanation8 of a similar character we would rather hear lems about bricks and mortar, materials and establishments of all kinds, and a little more about that very important unit, the British soldier. Grant that he is better housed, fed, clothed, armed, and so forth; is he a better soldier ? He ought to be the best soldier in the world, not only for the manifold external advantages which the national solicitude accumulates about him, but because he has, as we honestly believe, the beat body and soul in the world. We should like to hear not only that he is better provisioned and accoutred, but that he can manage better for himself, has more mental resources than he had, can move about with less suffering, and make the most of his means. We should like to hear not only that he has a good Enfield musket, but that he is frequently practised in its use, and can take better aim at the requisite distances. In the continental armies the Rifle Brigades are continually recruited with those who in practice show themselves the best marksmen in the Line. Have we any practice of a nature to distinguish good marksmen, and do we make any use of them when they show themselves? HIave our regimental officers either opportunity or inducement to display qualifications for higher command? It would be something not only to know that our soldiers were in better health, bat also to be informed particularly of their marching so many miles in a day or a week, undergoing so much fatigue, or going through a certain course bearing some resemblance to a veritable campaign. From the earliest history the art of war has been one series of innovations and improvements, and the greatest Generals have been those who innovated the most. They were also invariably remarkable for their personal attention to the men and officers, and their anxiety to raise the standard as well as to win the confidence of all ranks. With Lord PALMERSTON, we give up the idea of rivalling the great continental armies. We have too many other drains on onr population, for the simple reason that we are too great, too widespread, too industrious, too maritime, too mercantile, too manufacturing, too colonial, too emigrating a people, to spare money for the unprofitable employment of playing at soldiers. But we have no lack of spirit, of strength, of money, or of skill. We must, then, make one British soldier do the work of any two others, if we can; and this is only to be done by gihing him not only good meat and drink, aras and accoutrements, but also the best training and education in our power.
If the truLth of history, as some people have thought, is to be looked for in finance, the speech of the CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER on Friday may furnish something resembling an epitome of the reign of OionRa dII. Itin,indeed, remarkable in the extreme to observe the variety of conclusions suggested by the figures which were laid before the House. Every separate item tells its own story of manners and customs, and the final inference gives us so much reason for satisfaction with our own times, when contrasted -with thoso of our forefathers, that we can peruse and reflect upon the lecture without the least Idegree of tedium. The general result of a com! parison between the expenditure upon the Royal House in the reign of King GnouGP III. and that applied to the same purposes under Queen VICTORU is, as the country has already learnt, greatly in favour of the latter; but the contrast afforded by the particulars of the two accounts is more striking still. The Civil LiBt, or gross amount provided for the purposes in question, during the former reign, was 447,4361., whereas the corresponding provision in the present reign is only 385,0001. This, however, by no means represents the whole difference-in fact, it is the least part of it. Oar readers are aware that the settIement of the Civil List is in compensation for the hereditary property of the CRowy which has been given up to the country; but in the time of GEORiGE III. this bargain had been left very incomplete, to the advantage of the Sovereign, who enjoyed full receipts without having made a full surrender. Duhring the reign in question a sum exceeding 12,000,0001. of hereditary revenue was still left at the disposal of the Caowv, and of this nearly 7,000,0001. was directly applicable to the Civil List expenses. We may add, therefore, for the 60 years of this Monarch's reign something like 100,0001. a-year to the figures given above. Then, twhereas the PRINCE CONSORT of Queen VIcTORIA receives but 30,0001. per annum, theQUEEN CONSOXT of GEORGE IIL received more than twice as much, so that the account, even in its first shapo, would stand as follows . GEORGE IIL QuZM VICTORIA. Civil List ... ... 447,436 Civil Lit ... ... 385000 Portion of heredi- Princes Annuity 8,000 tary revenue ... 100,000 Queen's Annuity ... 60,000 £415,000 £607,436 These figures show that the expenditure upon the Royal House at present is little more than twothirds of what it was at the period referred to; but the comparison must be pushed further before we can obtain its most instructive results. The payments made under the head of the Civil List in these times are applied with regularity and punctuality to their respective objects, and suffice for the purposes designed. No deficit accumulates, no debts are incurred, no supplementary estimates are required. But in the days of GEORGE IIL the amount of the Civil List did but nominally represent the expenses of the Sovereign. It was treated, as the CnANCELRo of the ExcEIQuxEa expressed it, "as a very elastic fund," nor was it thought either extraordinary or unbecoming that application should be made for fuzther grants in liquidation of debts or for special occasions. The excess of expendituro in King GEORGLas reign, for debts alone, averaged upwards of 50,0001. a-year, in addition to which allowances were constantly made for the Royal children separately. The whole system, in fact, was defective in those very points to which in the present day we should zttach the highest importance. A few thousand pounds more or less in a fixed allowance may be of no great consequence, but it is of the utmost consequence that expenditure should be adjusted to income, that economy and regularity should be obaerved, and that the highest household in the kingdom should set an example of those virtues without which neither nations nor individuals can thrivo. It is here that the contrast between the two reigns tells so signally in favour of the, present. I There is another point, however, which has, no doubt, occurred to some of our readers as involving matter in no small degree surprisng. The reign of GEORGE III. waa selected for especial comparison the other evening, because the position of that Sovereign, as the head of a large family, offered the most obvious analogies; but it might have been appealed to for other reasons. Strange as it may seem after the observations made above, the reign of GEORGE III. was eminently a moral and decorous reign. Notwithstanding the expenditure and excesses referred to there never was a King who lived with less ostentation, in greater privacy, on a more frugal scale, or with less personal extravagance. The whole country pointed with pride to a monarch who, in an age when dissipation and profligacy had become almost natural characteristics of Courts, was content to live like a private gentleman in the exercise of domestic virtue. We believe, indeed, that the personal character and family life of GEOEGE III., reflecting as they did the habits and even the prejudicea of middleclass Englishmen, had no trifling influence in preserving this kingdom from the convulsions by which Europe was shattered. How, then, are we to explain all these excesses and irregularities of finance in a household apparently of so excellent a stamp ? Queen VICTopL visits every province of her dominions, graces with her presence all the chief festivities of the time, extends her travels even beyond the bounds of the kingdom, ancd yet sets an example of economical virtues. GEORGE III. lived apparently in the plainest manner, entertained nobody, never travelled, and yet consumed half as much again as our reigning SOVEREIGN, without being able to make even that amount suffice. Where are we to look for the solution of this enigma? Something, no doubt, as was intimated in the debate, must be set down to the confusion still prevailing in those days between the expenses of the Royal Household, strictly understood, and other disbursements of a more public nature, which had been originally defrayed out of the Crown revenues. Considerable sums, included under the general head of "Court expenditure," were probably applied to the service of the State in some direction or other. Even this deduction, however, will still leave the main results to be accounted for, and the explanation, we think, will be found in the general spirit of the time., with which, in fact, such things were perfectly in accordance, though they were not so with the habits of the Sovereign. The economy of GEORGy III. was practised instinctively, and was purely personal. Everything around him reflected a different state of opinion. It was not thought improper either to run into excesses of the kind described, or to apply to Parliament for the means of meeting them by extraordinary grants of money. Fees, perquisites, and sinecures were still in full operation, a special license of expenditure was still thought to attach to Royalty, and consequently, tlough the Kinig might be frugal, there was nothing to keep the Household from extravagance, or to inculcate the abstract obligations of economy. The result of such notions is what most people have had opportunities of observing. Money is simply muddled away instead of beiDg openly spent, and the sacrifice is incurred without even the benefit of ihe show. True economy consists not so much in abstinence as in well-regulated expenditure, and the advantage of one system over the other can hardly be better shown than in a household which, like that of our present SOVEREIGN, exhibits the virtues of good management without any abdication of the dignities of Royalty.
Mr. BRIGh-T does not write from Geneva in gooi spirits about the present state of public affairs. It is not to be expected that he should; but, certainly, he does not make the best of things. Every. thing is going wrong,c "retrenchment har become " an obsolete word," free trade "haa made little progress for some years puat," and PriaTneftUr Reform is in tho worst hands it could possibly be-viz., in Lord PArMERSTON'S. In his glootrui about tlle present he has even grown 8 a,tor temporis acti, and goes back in memory to the good old days of Sir ROBnBT PFn and the Duke of WERLfNGTON, 44 when the military "expenditure was only half the amount that it "is at present, although a large army is no "longer necessary to maintain tranquillity in "Ireland." Things must be very bad indeed to make MIr. B=IGHT recur with fond regret to the past, and throw a last long lingering look behind upon the reign of the old Duke. But any reign is better than Lord PALMERSTON7S. LordaPAsNERSTON can do nothing well. He is the very genius of misrule, and a cheat into the bargain. Do not trust him. If he gives you a Reform Bill, be quite sure that there is some dodgo at the bottom of it which will let in the enemy. " It " would be easy to double the number of electors "and at the same time to increase the aris. "tocratical influence in Parliament." There will be poison in the cup if Lord PALMERSTON is chief butler; do not put it to your lips. He is a magician who has contrived by his charms: to fascinate the English public, but they will knowr what his gifts are some day, if they accept them. Mr. BaiGHT has an indefinite estimate of the capacity of the English public for being gulled. Such a belief is not, indeed, much more complipnentary to the English public than it is to Lord PIAxMRSTON, representing, as it does, the two in that well known and surummary relation of knave and fool; but this in substance is very much the relation, in Mir. BnrGon3s eyes, of the English people and the PREMrm to each other. We hope that this melancholy view of the present state of public affairs arises in part from Mr. Bniaxois distance from the scene of action-a distance which none lament more than ourselves. Things often sound worse at a distance than they really are. There is room for a morbid imagination to work; she has it all to herself, unchecked and unbalanced by the natural cheerfulness of action and a share in the busines and realities of the scene. One part, however, of Mfr. BRIGEres criticism on public matters certainly deserves the praise of disinterestedness. Ho " protests against any trick "to obstract the free action of majorities, such as "that proposed in Lord Jo.N- Russnnes first Bill, "as calculated to undermnine the very basis of " representative iustitutions." Such a protest, i we say, most disinterested in Mr. BRiGHT, because, as it happens, he has just now lost his seat from the very action of the principle which he so stoutly vindicates-" the free action of ma" jorities." Had Manchester returned three members, while each elector could only vote for two, :Nr. BRIGHT would probably at this moment be member for Manchester. As it is, the 4,000 votes that have been given for him have done him no more good than 4, and all those thousand voters are unrepresented in this Parliament. Is this result of the " free action of " majorities?' a very fair one ? And is the representation of the people more faithful and more complete in this way than if those 4,000 had had their smaller share of the representatives of Manchester-one out of three ? It certainly appears to us that the latter would have been the more exact and more faithful representation, and that Parliament would upon this plan be a more true reflection of the public, with all its different sbades of opinion, than it is now. It may doubtless be said that one plan is as fair as another in the long run, that if one portion of a constituent body is wholly excluded from the representation at one election the rival portion is wholly excluded at another, so that, taking one election with another, both aides get fair play. Thus in M1anche-ter itself Mr. BRIGRT's supporters, having been the dominant psrty since 1840, and having monopolized the representation all this time, now find it their turn to take the outside, and the opposite party have their innings. But, even if there is something like fair play in the lODg run under the present system, the mode and form of this representative justice are rather awkward, because justice is attained not by fair division at the time, but by an alternation of monopolies. At every struggle it is a matter of life and death for that session. Every election is a conquest which leaves one party on the field and the other nowhere. There is no quarter given; if you do not conquer, you die. If the chances of things give something like justice in the long run on this system, it is only by an oscillation of life and death,-total extinctions and revivals. But why should time and chance do very awkwardly what we are able to do much better by regular arrangement? Why should our elections be scenes of insolent elation on one side and mortified prostration on the other, if we can by a simple plan produce a more tempered result? There may be some -a good many, perhaps-who like the fever and the stimulus of the alternative which our present system presents, who had rather have a kill-or-cure medicine, who like an election all the better the more it is like a battle and the less quarter is given, who like the sphere of risk and the excitement of the genuine lottery or gaming sable, and who shout "H eads" or " Tails," "All or " nothing," with genuine glee. Elections on a more tempered and balanced plan may appear to these choice spirits rather tame affairs, but the mass of men had rather have more equality and evenness in the working of the representative system, even if it v; ere gained with some loss of excitement. It may be added that the present " free action of majori" ties" gives too much opportunity for the formation of cliques and schools that grow by the long monopoly of the representation of important places. Mr. BErIrG will not, of course, agree with us, and will think this, perhaps, one of the great advantages of the present system; but we do not think that long monopoly of representation has been of anyparticular advantageto the "Man" chester School," which has thus acquired a sort of stiffness and pedantry of its own, and set up its own maxims, in defiance of general opinion. The "M 3,anchester School" had evidently bolstered itself up on the idea that the long monopoly of the great manufacturing capital had made it an established authority, and given it a right to lay down the law and teach the rest of the world on all subjects connected with social progres. As the exclusive representatives of the principal seat of the great movement of modern times, the. metropolis of manufacturing aFt and invention, they have spoken ex catedrd, and invested themselves with a mission to put down war and do many other things; and, in short, regarded themselves as the "lights of the age." Hlad they only had their share of the representation of Manchester they might be more modest teachers, but monopoly gave them overweening confidence. This is only an incidental result of the present " free action of majorities." The great argument is, that a representative system should provide as much fair play and equality, and that as evenly and continuously, as possible ; and with this object we do not think it would be amiss if the larger towns and some of the more populous counties were excepted from "the free action of ''majorities."

Thefts, e.hiefly of horses, by small prowling bodies of Cafifres, were almost daily reported, and several murders had been oommitted, causing a seneral feeling of alarm and insecurity. "The measue adopted by Sir George Grey, on his arrival on the spot, were of the most decided cbaracter. In a Government notice isued tothe chiefs, in his capacity of High Commissioner, he at once declared to them his determination 'to check proceedings which, it allowed to continue, will lead to such lamentable results, which ae unpardonable, as labour is provided for all industrio%well. disposed persons who may be in a state of destitution.' Four Cayree, found that morning lurking in the Crown Beserve (the Amatclas) were ordered to be transported--a punishment of which it is said thespeople have a great horror, and the chiefs were informed that 'all persons caught attempting to oommit, or havingcommitted, robbery with arms in their hands will, when convicted of mh offence, be punished with death' He also warned them hat ' all Caffres foand robbing in the colony or elsewhere will be fired upon if it is foond impossible to capture theea.' " Simultaneously with these severe announcements,whLich were at once sternly carried into effect, offers Were madeto the well-disposed of food and employment at regular-wage on public works, and every facility was given them to enter the servioe of the colonial farmers.

MELAWCHOLY DEATHS.-A deplorable boat aci- dent, by which Ensign George H. Bowles, of the 85th Regimeut of Foot, the depet of wlhich is now stationed at iulwood Garri,on, near Predton, and a nlan named James Cartnel, the servant of Mr. William Paley, suanufecturer, of that town, lost their lives, occurred on the river Ribble on Saturday evening last. Iu the afternoon of that day Mr. Paley and the twvo deceased went in a sailing boat down the Ribble from Preston to Lytham, a marino village about 12 miles distant, which place they reached in safety; and in the evening, when the hour for returning arrived, Mr. Paley suggested that they should all go back by ri'lway. 3Gr. Bowles objected, saying that he preferrefd returning in the boat; and, after some demur on the part of MIr. Psley, that gentlemnct returned by rail to Preston, and the ofiloer anld FerVaDt took the bo3t. Nothing was heard of the two last. mentioned persons till Sunday evening, when Mr. Patey received intortation that his servant had been found drowned in the IRibble, at Naze Point, which is abont aix miles distant from Preston, by a man naumed Rowland QornalL There caD be no doubt that Mr. Bowles has met with a similar fate, but tup to yesterday afternooa (Monday) his body had not been found. Various conjectures are cur. rent with respect to this sad accideut, the most probable of wbich is that the boat was suddeDly upset by a squsU of wind. Mr. Myres, coroner, was to hold an inquest yesterday afternoon on the body of Cartniel, at the vilege of Freckle. ton, near the Naze.

- - SPORTING INTELLIGENCE. EPSOM I RACES. Tr,r,.,, .Uy genulne turfites only is the opening day of the EpsorA Zlcting regarded with interest, becau-e it affords almost the opportunity o0 "squarinlg" their Derby book4, and iacnsa it is not unfrequently marked by incidents which ybe looked upon as the shadow of the great coming 'Ovent. The public, however, apparently deem it merely a Sress rehearsal for the grand performance which in to take Ilace on the morrow. The course, therefore, invariably %resents a somewhat dreary appearance; the police seem t'o form the principal spectators, while booth-keepers and s7aiters loungo outside their " caravansari3,s" resting after i3heir busy preparations to meet the requirements of the =nanynmouthod multitude, and gipsy forttne-teilers and (tlnerant serenaders in unprofession2a costume recline idly on the grams in eager anticipation of a fine Derby day and a zich harvest. The characteristics of the opening day were -on this occasion unaltered. Judging froLa the favourablo auspices under -which the nieeting commenced, the " Isthmian games " are likely to Ibo purs-ed with their wonted success. The weather, which &nd been dreary and unsettled, underwent a pleasant change, -.nd in the place of a driving mist and rain were a clear 4t. xmosphere and a sanny sky. The heavy rain had, howov9r, mot produced the desired effect on the coursv, which is stll very hard; it is never theless as smooth and as level as a 'bowling-green, and, indeed, Mr. Dorling seems to have 'Otmitted nothing which could tend to improve its condition. The result of the first race, the Craven Stakeo, exercisod -n important influence over speculation on the Derby.-Tt 'was won by Blue Jacket, whoso victory over an animal of nuch approved merit as Gemma di Vergy created a sensation. 2!Blue Jacket was immediately after the race backed for the Derby for a large aura at 30 to 1, while Tournament, his .ntnblo companion, was at onco advanced to the position of lreading favourite. Report state3 that Tournament gallopped away with the utmost easo from Blue Jacket iu 3 tri 1&St Monday week, and the rush to get on him was almost general. Blue Jacket was declared not to stat for the Derby at half -past 4 o'clock, and his withdrawal imparted additional confidence to the partisans of Tourna'nent. A list of quotations on the Derby will be found appended Io our repnrt. Except with regard to the principal fravourites tire betting was neither brisk nor important. 'The Saunterer party bore up stoutly for their horse -hroughout the day, and in the course of the afternoon some interest and ouriosity were excited by " Mr. F. Robin8on's" -hallenging them to make a match against Anton for 2,0001. lh. ft.

THE CUBAN SLAVE TARADE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The capture of a Spanish slaver off the coast of Cuba, under circumstances which have revealed the atrocities which are still perpetrated by Spain in violation of her engagements to this country, has re-awakened the public sympathy with a cause which can never lose Its interest with Englishmen. Just half a century ago, in the midst of a desolating war, in which we were contending for national existence, an Act was passed to abolish the slave trade, and in seven years (from 1807 to 1814), while our armies were resouing Spain from subjugation, our fleets redeemed Africa from a scourge which the cupidity of the maritime nations of Europe had for more than two centuries inffioted on her. It was a fortunate coincidence that the United States of America, the only neutral Power which could have defeated our meesures during the war, had herself abolished the slave trade, which France also in 1815 renounced. The expansion of colonial trade after the peace, and the objections of foreign Powers -to coneede to us the right of search, having led to its revival, treaties were made with other maritime Powers which for a long period were imperfectly executed, but eventually Spain has remained the only State who has persisted in violating her engagements. When, it may be asked, was Spain otherwise than a persecutor? Are not her cruelties attested in her treatment of the Moors, of the native races of America, of her subjects at home and in the Netherlands, and, lastly, of the Africans? And, having originated the negro slave trade in her colonies, has she not pursued it, regardless of the aggravated sufferings of her victims, and the wishes and welfare of her colonial subjects, who, like the Brazilians, it left to themselves,would long ago have repudiated it ? Is it not notorious that vessels are employed with slave decks, four feet between the beams, in whioh the negroes are crammed to suffocation-that cargoes of boys and girls are collected who are without African marks to avoid detection in Cuba-that the crews are composed of ruftians and desperadoes of al nations-and that it they escape our cruisers the surviving victims are landed to be worked out by excessive labour and replaced by others? These facts were known when the system of free trade was inaugurated, and it was contended that if slavegrown cotton must continue to be admitted to our markets from America Cuban sugars could not consistently be excluded. But had the United States contractod a treaty with us which they had systematicalUy violated, or did they compel us to maintain a squadron on the African coast, at the cost of 500,0001. annually, to suppress the iUicit traffic which she encouraged.? It is useless to contend that vessels of American build are employed by the slave traders, when it is notorious that the returns for Cuban sugars imported by us are made in commodities adapted to and destined for the African markets, and that we are thus in our conm mercial dealings as deeply implicated in the odious traffic as if we riveted the chains on the unfortunate negroes. In point of fact, to designate as free trade our dealings in Caban sugars, while notoriously raised by means of the slave trade, is to encourage the calling of the Spanish freebooters to the prejudice of our own free colonies, it being Incontesaible that, while free labour is able to compete with slave labour where the slave is taken care of, it Is otherwise where the labourer is worked out and his place can be supplied by another. Comparing the charges on the best managed estates in the BritishWest Indies and in Cuba, the expenses may fairly be estimated at one-third less on the latter, being a premium from the consumer to the slavedealer of not less than 4s. per cwt. when prices are remunerative to the honest producer. The practical question, therefore, is how long, under the pretext of free trade, we are to encourage a system of fraud and iniquity against our own interests and the wishes of the free population of the Spanish colonies, for the gain of a fewr miscreants speculating on the sufferings of the wretched victims of their cupidity, obstructing the deliverance of Africa from the scourge which retards her civilization, the diffuaion of Christianiry, and the spread of peaceful commerce - While we should augment our squadron of small vessels on the coast of Cuba, there are many considerations which must weigh with us in maintaining our position on the African coast. It may even be a question whether some additional expense should not be incurred by the grant of premiums for the rescue of negoes taken in the barracoons as well as in the slavers, whereby their greatest sufferings are prevented, and also the chanee of eluding our cruisers; and to this end the co-operation of the native authorities should bo sedulously encouraged; and, if -with these measures a period should be fixed for excluding from our markets the sugars of those countries where the slave trade is carried on in violation of treaty engagements, the readiest means will be takan to curtail the expenses of our armaments withonu in the end diminishing the supply of sugars, and also o' worthily commemorating in 1857 the jubilee of the abolition in 1807. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. ANGLICUS.

The illuminations in celebration of Her Majesty's birth. day were as general and brilliant as we remember on any former occasion, They were not confined moreover to Her Majesty's tradesmen, nor to the great thoroughfares of the West-end, but were extended to districts where the Royal arms are rarely to be seen. The principal scene of attraction was St. James's-street and Pall-mall, but there were some beautiful contrivances in Regent-street which drew forth cheers from the populace.
THE FALL OF HOUSES IN TOTTENHAM.COURr- ROAD. Yesterday Mfr. Brent, the Depaty Coroner, and the jury empannelled to inquire as to the deaths of the sufferers by the late falling down of houses in Tottenham-court.road; ea~ssembled for the fifth time at Lawson's-rooms, lowecrstreet. Thmas Miller examined.-T reside in George-street. HIamptead-road, and am a carpenter. I was at workc at the roof of the houses 148 and 1849 on the morning of the accident. I was employed by Mr. Hunter. I was on the scaffold in front of the house 148 and I heard a crack. I said, " Good God I what is the matter 7 to a man who was with me on the scaffold, and in an instant after the same man said, " Look I here are all the nouse coming down!" Ithen ranaway. Iraw the stack of chimneys of the houses Nos. 146 and 147 give way fiast, and then the houses followed. I cannot acount forthe occurrence. Mr. John Maples examined.-I reside at Hampskad, and am an upholsterer. The houses 145, 146, and 147, Tottenham-court-road were in my occupation. About three weeks after Mr. Hunter commenecd alterations on his premises I commenced them on my premises. Mr. Raggett was my surveyor. He was recommended to me by Mr. Lockyer, the architect. Mr. Taylor, the builder, was engaged by Mr. Raggett at my suggestion. He had done work for me before, and I had alwvays found him a careful man. One of the works was to raise the flooring of the house No. 147 two feet, to make it level with the floor of 146. A new brestsammer was required to be put ia at 147 to efleot this object. I had no communication with the district surveyor but once, and he then said he thought the party-wail (alluding to hlr. Hunter's party-wail) must come down. I replied, "I hope not." There was an agreement between Mr. Hunter and myself as to the repairing of this party wall. I never heard from Mr. Baker, the district surveyor, that he had condemned the party-wall, but there was a notice from the police, which I sent at once to Mr. 2aggett. I placed myself in the hands of Mr. Raggett, my surveyor, and MIr. Taylor, the builder. Mr. George Parton Raggett, a surveyor, who was engaged by Mr. Maple to superintend the alterations, gave an explanation of them. He said,-I have been 27 years In the profession. I consider the cause of the occurrence was the cutting away of the chimney breasts of the party-wall of the houses 147 and 148, and that the making the two holes in that wall on the morning of the accident. Mr. Joseph Taylor, examined.-I reside at 97, Upper Seymour-street, Euston-square. I am a builder. I was engaged to carry out certain alterations at Mrr. Maples's premises, under Mr. Raggett, the sarveyor. I saw Mr. Baker on the 23d, and told him tho character of the works. He objected to the removal of the chimney breasts. Nothing was done till the 27th, when the works were comamenced, and on the 3'th the new bresbunamer was put in and properly pinned. On May the 4th we struck the first shores, but before we did so iron ties were put up from the brestsrsmmer to the joists, and into the garden. On the Thumday before the accident we had built UD t fo piers from the basement to the ground-floor ready to receive the iron stancheons, and stone corbels were also put into the wall. That, in my opinion, was quite sufficient of itself to carry the superstracture, but I put two pieces of wood in addition, five feet before. I went all round the premises on the morning of the accident, and saw all saie and right till I observed Barnes making a hole in Hunter's party-wall. I asked him what he wasgoing to do, andi he said to underpin it and put in new brick work to the first-floor. I told him to be careful, as it was a very old wall. I saw Mr. Baker, the district surveyor, on the Friday, and he told me to stop my men doing the matchboarding of Mr. Maple's house, No. 147, as he was determined on having that wall (alluding to Mr. Hunter's) taken down; that they were to have a meeting tbat afternoon, and he would have it down. " You have had mny consent." he said, totakeyourchimneybreasts down, but they have taken their chim:sey breasts -down without my consent, and I will have it down." I had got about 165 feet distant from the houses, when they fell towards the New-road. The cornices fell over on to the pavement, and the fronts fell in. I was much amaed and alarmed, knowing my own son and 19 of my men were on the premises. I ran and informed hlr. Raggett, and then came back and mustered 14 of my men. In my opinion, tho cause of the accident was the weak state of Mr. Hunter's wall, rendered still weaker by cutting the holes for the underpinning. I ought to have had notice that such work was going to be done to Mr. Hunter's wall, which they did not give me. There being no other evidence, the inquiry was adjourned till Frday.

I THE CAMP AT ALDERSOTT. ,, As a tener u Aldersholt is nota pieu ntpleeto visit. Like one of DneWs circles it hu no medium iii t.s.' perature; and Is eitber Ms arid and dusty se Sdhr or oold nd cuttingas the Arctic regions. So with the wind, wh is alwmys revelling over tbe plain-it is either a hot, puffy blast, half beath haltf sand, or it blusters with a violence against wkich it is almost uselesacontendiog. Yeserday All thee atmospherie vuiatioac succeeded each other with a rapidity which was tnisngand uncomfortable to the l]st degree. A grand revier in bonour of the Queen'> birthday wag anticipated by the public and, we believe, intended by the authorities; but the very unsettled state of the weatber (which only settled at brief intervals into heavy rain) prevent-d the dispay so fUr as a sham fight was concerned. An unusa number of visitors went down to the Camp by the early trains, theegh the result hardly repaid their promptitude, for nothing took place till ifter 2o'clock. All early corners, therefore, had ample oDpor. tunities Afforded them of inspecting tbe beauties of the Camp, whicb, to do them mere justice, mnay be sen in the very briefest period. To a superficial obsrver the whole beals as stronlg a resemblanco as ever to tbe black-looking sheds round the mouth of a coalpit, and the only ornamental feature on the whole plain is the neat litte clubhouas hedged in, as if taste was impounded for aving strayed so far. Those familiar with the Camp, especiay with its last year's aspect, will however under its general maisk of monotony notice many changee and some improvemerts. The whole ground both between and round the huts is sorupu. lously clean, and the huts themselves kave,a tidy and even a comfortable air. The cavalry stables are great improvements; inside they are lofty, spcious, dry, wel drained and ventilated, paved with stone, and as clean as the huts. Each atable accommodates 70 horses, which sand in rows at both sides, 8s aceustomed to one another's presence S eVen to have givex up kicking. At intervals of every 20 feet or so doors am fixed in the side walls, in order to give free egress to all the hores instantly in case of any accident from fire. Outside the stables Are surrounded with trim little gadens, which though containing nothing beyond a few wild plaint and stone devices, look tateful, and augur well for the discipline and good order pf the Camp. The visitor will observe with surprise that all these ranges of stabbs (than wlich it would be imposible under the circumstances to have better) are formed of roughplanks, roofed in. with eanvas-a means of shelter which, it wil be recollected, was derided as utterly worthless when sought to be applied to our cavalry in the Crimea. Some months experienoe of these stables at Aldershott, completely overturns a the hypothetical objections which were urged aa reaons against their nss in the EAst before the Chelsa Board of Inquiry. In the South Camp (beyond that wretched cal,oompred with which Lethe must have been a purling brook} rdical changes bave taken place. Where the eye luat year only rested upon a dreary expanse of common, varied here and there with a treacherous morass, a town of permAaeat barracks is fast springing into existence. Whole acres of stabling and streets of barracks extend over an intui nseo space. These edifices are 4iistinguisbed by some new and most important improvernents in barrack building, and are certainly the most complete and useful buildings of the kind that have ever been erected in this country. In this brief notice it is impossible to convey a proper idea of thgir extent and fitness, but we shall take occasion to refer to the subject again as the works advance towards completion.. A little before 2 o'clock the troops in Camp were under arms, and, after the usual parade inspection in front of their huts, upwards of 14,000 men of all arms began to move across the common towards the long valley. An immense concoure of spectators had by that time colleted, and were fas pouriDg in from the surzounding neighbourhood. For once the dust of Aldershott had been completely laid by heavy storms of rain which swept over the Camp in the morning, and it was kept in subjection by drenching showers at short intervals throughout the remainder of the day. There were, however, moments when even the dust would have been a reEef to the oold rain. As usual, the most picturesque feature of the day was while the mass of troops were en route to the long valley; the dense sombre columns of the Rifles contrasted finly with the bright hues of the Line Regiments, Guards and Cavalry, while the long trains of Artillery on the flanks seemed like a masive frame to the bright picturb in the centre, Nearly the whole of the troops now wear the uniforms contracted for by the Goverhment, and not by the 7egimental colonels. The importanoe of having superseded the latter gallant clothiers is manifested in the altered appearance of the men. Their ooats are of begatiful material, the privates wering the cloth formerly only given to sergeants, whle the sergeants have the same as the commissioned oficers. Yesterday one or two men could be discerned still dressed in the cId brick-coloured baize, and having n indescribably dingy appearance among their well-clad comrades. All the infantry marched to the ground in open columns of companies-the cavalry and artilery in troops, and troops of Iatterie. With the exception of the usual Camp Guards from each corps there were out yesterday two companies of the Royal Engineers, three field batteries, two troops of Horse Artillery, the 15th and 7th Hussars; two companies of the Grenadier Guards; 1st battalion of Coldstream Guards; the Rifle Brigade, Ist, 2d, and 3d battalions; the 22d, 54th, 66th, 19th, 88th, 20th, and 97th Regiments, with some of the 1st battalion of the Military Train. The whole moved across the long valley, and formed for a short time in the slope of the long hil in dose column, looking at the distance as if rich pastures had suddenly sprung into bloom across the barren heath. When General KnoUys came upon the ground the columns were deployed into a line two deep and nearly a mile and a-half in length, tapering away into a distant streak of red which twinkled with the glitter of bayonets. In the centre of the huge semicircle a double line was formed by the Guards, Cavalry, and Horse Artiery, with the field batteries, in front of alL The latter having fired the usual Royal salute, the Minids of the whole force rose into the air as if by magic, and the feu de joie commenced, at flirst with a confused hoarse rattle, but gradually swelling into one tremendous roar which flled the air and seemed to make the very plain vibrate and throb beneath its thundering din. Three times was this imposing volley given, the echoes of one scarcely dying away ere another was commenced, at Royal salute of the day-the men's hearty cheers-winding up the whole. The latter were often renewed, coming from the extreme right of the line like the distant roar of the see, and sometimes almost, vieing with the noise of the musketry. The line then broka up, and the mosr interesting feature of the day-the marching past the General-began. The force passed the Staff in the foUowing order:-Troops of Royal Horse Artilery, the 7th and 15th Hussars, companies of Engineers, a field battery, the Guards 22d Regiment, 3d Battalion of Rifles, 54th and 66th Regiments, field battery, 19th and 88th Regimnents, 1st Battaltou of Rifles field battery, 20th and 97th Regiments, and 2d Battalion of Rifles. The marching of the Guards was, as it always is, faultleFss. Each company seemed one solid machine, firm as a wall, and not a nman an inch beyond or behind his comrade. After these the corps the most conspicuous for steady movement and perfect formation were the 20th and 88th. The ranks of the latter were cruelly thinned in the late war, and, for the numbers engaged, probably more men of this fite old regiment felL in action with the enemy than in any other corps. At Inkermann more than half of those in action were kiUed or wounded, and the memory of their losses at both attacks on the Redan must be but too fresh in the minds ot many of our readers to need rmcapituticn here. The breaches then made in their ranks have been but iU repaired, and mere lads now represent the fine ccmpanies of picked eoldiers which lauded at Kalaiuita. Nevertheless the marching of the regiment was remarked and admired yesterday. After aU the infantry had passed the cavtlry and artillery again returned and passed the staff at a canter, and with this the day's proceedings terminated. It may save our readers some disappointment if we inform them that the field-da1s now are no longer Tuesday and Friday. Retrenchment has penetrated the Camp, if reform has not, and powder-burning is strictly limited to Wednesdays. They will also be glad to learn that a handsome and commodious station is being erected at Main borongs, which soon promises to be one of the most com forae, as it undoubtedly is already one o naged, on the railway.
THE WAR IN CBZ.IVA. TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Mr. Cobden's letter (written in terms towards me personally for which I feel very grateful) requires me to trouble you with a word of expltnation on my part. The questions on the China war were mere notes for my erwn thought, which might on further reflection and eorretion have been fit to ask oi the Governruent; for surely it is not unreasonable that a Parliament which was called together mainly with reference to, tais question shouald require the Government to.state- What are Lord Elgie's. instrmetions as to the future pesi- ' ;ion of British subjects in China.? What guarantee X& bo be taker for tbe futur faithful performance of treai: engagemetsal Are the prepaiVons,s commensurate -with the objects which it is desiraN3 to attain? These are th. sabstance of my queries, and I see nothing in them iDron,eanb with the principles of free trade; for I do not elliNfree trade to be klicked and cuffed by John Chinam-an baause we are his best customers.

HALL, mx C0oNxsRvATivE 3TmrBEns FoR limns.-A vacancy has occurred in the representation of Leeds by the death of Mr. Robert Hall, who was returned, after a severe contest, as one of the members for that borough at the late election. Mr. Hall, who wasRecorder of Doncaster and Deputy-Recorder of Leeds, suffered sev.rely from an accident, about two years ago, onthe Great Northern Railway, near Leeds, and although: he so far recovered as to be able to resume his professional labours, biR constitntion was undoubtedly permanently iajured, and has given way at last to the labour and excitement consequent upon his recent struggle for Parliamentary honoursm He entered with great vigour into the politicali contest in whichn he was engaged for the representation of' his native town, and was unceasing, for more than a -woek before the day of election, in his efforts to- win his way, often addressing two or more meetinga of the electors in different parts of the borough. thesame day. After the election, when his hopes were czownewith victory, his strength appeared to give way, and hesuffered from the reactiion which followed the severe activity of the contest. He also thought that he received.injury from sitting in the House of Commons near oneof- theopenings for the admission of air. An influenza came- on. and added to the depression of tho system. He was advised to retire to Folkestone for the sake of relaxation, and whoen there he was forbidden even to write. As he grew worse. his medical adviser in Leeds (Mr. T. P. Teale) wa. summoned to Folkestone last Friday morning, and when hearrived he found him in an alarming state from fevers and quite delirious. The case proved to be beyond the power of medicine, and Mr. Hall expired at half-past 3 o'clock on. Tuesday morninz. aged 56. Mr. Hall was born in Beeds in tho year ISOL He was educated at the schoollof, Math, near Halifax, at the Leeds Free Grammar Schoel, and at Christ Church College, Oxford, where he held therank of first class in classics, and second class in mathematics. He had attained a very honoarable, position in his profession, and, as before statod was Recorder of Doncaster and Deputy-Recorder of Leeds. Referring to the death of Mr. Hall, the Lcrd&s Aerrur'y an organ politically opposed to him, says,-"' The eventis one of those solemn admonitions by which Etovidenco sooften teaches us-but so oft-en to be neglected or forgottenwbat shadows we re and what shadows we pursue. Scarcely had the deceased gentleman attained the object of his honourable ambition, to which he had been looking forward 'or many years, when the dart of death was- found to -be concealed among the laurels of victory, and he is. carried almost from the scene of triumph to the na-rrew house ap. pointed for all living. Mr. Halls death will be much lamented by his townsmen,-not merely by. his own.politi{cl friends, who will, of course, have double reason for sorrow. -but by aU who know either his profemsional or his private. character. He was an amiable, honourable,.and relgious man,-sincerely conscientious, largely benevolent, publicspirited, and desirous of doing all tha good-in his.power to his fellow-townsmen and his country. Ae a-lawyer, he was sound and cautious in jnugment, laborious in research, and accoiplisbed in various branches of his profesdion. His judicial duties as Recorder of Doncaster and Deputy-Recorder of Leeds turned bis attention to the important subjects of prson discipline and the reformation of criminials and he vsited some of the best continentaltreformatoriee, and published the results of his observations, with asview to- ractical results in this country. There is no.donbt that iE his life had been spared he would have taken an active part in the discussions of the Houise ef Commons on this question, and alsoonlaw rtform.

.FOREIG1YIrTLLaNFN - NOE. (FROiM om own ymaWn. t (A POA!On of tho fofowing OPP-od La 0u G=ud icU. 0iz of Yveterda:.-I PARIS, MOiDAY, AT 25, 6 n.I L. Walewski returned with the Emperor yesterday from Fontainebleau. Ee presided at the Con. ference held to-day on the NeuchAtel queation. No n-ew objections of any importance were started on either side; the draught of a protocol was, I am informed, agreed to without any difficulty, and the instrument which is to put an end to the ouarrel will be signed on an earl day. The question of the anubian Principalities remains pretty much the sane as before-England acting with Austria, and Austria opposed to the union; France and Sardinia in favour, and Russia "impenetrable." It is said that a commission, formed in Paris,will be aent to these provinces, with the object of examining all that relates to their agriculture, commerce, industry, topography, and military capabilities. A report will be addressed on these points to the French Government, who desire to he accuraWy informed by means of perconal observation on the spot. The commission will not, I believe, be exclusively composed of military men, though it is instituted by the Waroffice. Apropos of military matters, I may add that the Persian Government is said to have ordered, a number of rifles on the most approved plan to be made in France, for the purpose of arming the private guard of the Shah. The Grand Duke Constantine, before leaving Bordeaux, gave a sumof 1,OOOf. to theMayorfor the poor of thetow.m " The state corvette the leinelHortense, having on board the RusmianGrand Duke," says the Courrier de Nantes, " left Rochefort on Thursday afternoon at 1 o'clock, and arrived the next morning at 6 at St. Nazaire. The Prefect, the principal authorities of Nantes, and the heads of t'he works of Indret, proceeded in the Pariden steamer to receive the Duke, who immediately went on board the smaller steamer, and proceeded to Indret, whvere he arrived at 10 o'clock." A letter from Brest states that the Grand Duke was expected in that port yesterday from St. Nazaire. Grand preparations were being made at the Maritime Prefecture and the Arsenal for bis reception. This, day, there being the highest tide of the year, the Prince w,ill be present at the launch of theArdente frigate, one of the eight steamvessels built on the model of the Imp6ratrice Eug6nie, which was so much admred at Toulon by the Grand Duke. The Emperor, the Empress, the Prince Imperial, and the King of Bavania arrived yesterday afternoon at half-past 3 In Paris from Fontaineblean. The Kling of Bavaria dined inl the apartments prepared for him in lthe Pavilon Marsan, at the luierses. lIe afterwards visited the Vaudeville Theatre. General Baron de Beville, aide-decamp to the Emperor; Count Tascher de la Pagerie, Chamberlain to the Empress; and Count de Riaucourt, Equerry to the Emperor, have been placed ast the orders of the King during his Stay in France. His Majesty paid a visit to-day to Prince Jerome at the Palais Royal. He has fixed to-morrow for receiving the Diplomatic Corps. A thuaderstorm, even more violent than that of Thursday last, burst over Paris to-day. The morning was fine, though cloudy, without much sultriness. At 3 o'clock the eky became completely overcast and lowering, and the lightning began to dart from the heavy masa of clouds. The wind rapidly rose, and grew to almost the fury of a hurricane, and the thunder-peals were loud and frequent. The rain rushed down in a deluge, and in a few minutes torrents swept along the streets. This storni of thunder, wind, and rain was indeed most violent, though it did not last more than half an hour, but the thoroughfares were completely flooded. After a short interval the rain again came down in abundance, and continued for some time. We trust it is not confined to Paris, as it was most ,wanted in the country. The retail trade of Paris, which first gave signs of returning life afortnight ago, grew more active last week. The improvement in certain branches is attributable rather to the necessities attendant on the season than to the spirit of speculation. The milliners, dressmakers, and tailors received in the course of a few days more orders than they can execute for three weeks to come, and the shops from which these indispensable professors of the science of fashion are supplied find, of course, their advantage in the sudden change from cold to vwarm weather, which produces an equally sudden demand for articles of light clothing. AlU do not participate in the improvement; the wholesale houses generally have not so much cause to be satisfied -with their sales. Some large orders have, however, been received from the departments forParis articles, and some English houses have made liberal purchases in jewelry and perfumery. The wholesale establishments would probably do more business but for the long credit required by their customers, and which the manufacturers cannot easily grant on account of the tightness of the money-market and the consequent difficulty in discounting. The orders from the departments are much smaller at this season than in the corresponding periods in former years, as the country tradesmen (since the extension of railroads) buy but little at a time, and only renew their stock of goods according as it is exhausted, so that their supply is limited, though always fresh, and of the newest fashion. Under the present system the provincial trades do not require so large an amount of capital as formerly. The rise in the price of sugar in the Paris market, which had heen going on for some time, was checked last week, and it is probable that it has reached its highest point. Speculation appears to have been directed to the purchase of tallow, which rose last week to 73f. SOc. the 50 kilogrammes outside the barrier. The speculators at the Paris corn-market endeavoured last week to create an artificial rice in grain, under pretence that the dry weatber is causing uneasiness to the farmers. The accounts from the agricultural districts are, however, by no means unfavourable, and the provincial mark-ets are still looking down. Allaccounts concur in describing the growingorops as excellent. The only kinds of gran which have at all suffered for the want of rain are rae and oats, and a few such showers as we have had in the neighbourhood of Paris lately 'will set them all right. The wheat promises a third more produce than the crop of last year. The millers succeeded at the last Paris market in forcing up the price of flour If. the sack of 157 kilogrammes, but the bakers were unwilling to submit to this increase, and there was but little business transacted. The reserve of flour in the market stores has fallen to 9,000 metrical quintals. Flour of the best quality is quoted at 75f. the sack ; that used by bakers at G7f., and thirds at from 60f. to 57f. The last accounts from the provincial corn- markets announce that they are well supplied with wheat. The farmers find the necessity for clearing out their granaries, in expectation of an abundant harvest. Oats are in good demand. The Minister of War advertised for a supply of oats, the biddings to be received onWednesday last. He received only one offer of 300 quintals, to be delivered in Paris at 23f. 25c. the 100 kilogramumes. Rye of good quality is likewise scarce, and brings readily 29f. 5Oc. the measure of 115 kilogrammes. The alarm produced in the wine-growing departments by the cold vreather experienced at the latter end of April is now found to have had no cause. Very few vines have suffered, and even those which were affected by the frost have thrown out fresh shoots. It is ex- pected that the present hot weather will remove all appearance of disease. Nevertheless, the price of 'wine is not diminishing; the only change perceptible is that the holders of stocks are more willing to dispose of them. Larae quantities of foreign wine continue to arrive in the south of France. At Bordeaux old wiines are more sought than new. There is no change to be remarked in the price of spirits. 13e.*troot spirit is quoted at 118f. the hectolitre at Arras, and at 128f. in Paris. M. de Parieu, Vice-President of the Senate, is spoken of as the most likely person to succeed Count d'Argout as Governor of the Bank of France. The situation, independently of the consideration attendant on being at the head of so great an establishment, is an excellent one in a pecuniary point of view, as the salary is 60,000f., with payment, besides, for attendance at the sittings of the Board, and a splendid residence; on the whole, the value may be setdown at lO0,OOOf. a-year. The Governor, moreover, has the prospect of obtaining, after his retirement from office, a seat in the Senate, which is worth 30,000f. Count d'Argout has been at the head of the Bank of France since 1834. The Monite-r publishes the official return of the CustohW' receipts for the month of April, which omountedto 16,04,211., being 2,O6S,039f. more than in the corresponding month of last year. The 'Ovmsnarson of the3 receipts for the first four months of 1857 with those of 1856 shows an increaso of 5,25i3,892f. in favour of the former, the amounts being respectively 57,840,664?. and 52,587,A72f.

The Archduchess Sophia Frederic was so much better yesterday that their MIajesties resolved' to' commence their journey to Jasz-Breny, Szegedii, Grosswardein, and Trozal in, the morning of the 23d. When the Emperor visited Waitzen, on I the 20th, M. von R4thy; the burgomaster off the city, assured him " that a se4 of delight had inundated the breasts of the inhabitants of the city when they received the newg of the graciou* iften. tions of his most exolted Majesty towards- them." The florid style of M. von R6thy must have been to the taste of the fathers of the city, for they, cheered most lustily when he had finished bis speech; but the Emperor, whose reply was very brief, did not seem at all edifieds by vbat he had heard. It may be observed that when the emplotjys and civic dignitaries lard the speeches wrhichthey address to His Majesty with bombast and fulsome flattery they prove that they know nothing of the peculiarities of his character. The Emperor Francis Joseph is extremely jealoust of his dignity, and expects to be treated with all that respect which is due to his elevated rank; but he dislikes servility and abhors anything that has the most distant resemblantce to what is commonly called "humbug." It is not many year since an excesively flattering speech was publicly addremaed-to His Majesty, and the signs of impatience and disapprobatiots which he manifested are still present to my memory. When the Emperor made his entry into Waitzen he was preceded by a "BLanderium" of peasants, dressed in the national costume, which, as you have already been informed, is composed of a wide.linen shirt, with a short embroidered jacket over it, and remarkably large linen drawers, called "gatya." If on the head is put a round, low-crowned hat,with a feather, and on the feet a pair of boots (ozismen), with long spur, you have a Hlungaria peasant in his best (summer) clothes, The commander of the " Banderiulm" wvas the notary public of Hartyan, who wore a silk shirt, with gold em broidery and drawers to match The open jacket (attiZa) was cut like that worn by the peasants, but more richly embroidered. As the heat was very oppremive on the 20th, the Emperor reviewed the troops as expeditiously as possible, and then sent them back to their barracks. According to a Vienna Vaper-which, however, very frequently contains icorrect news-150 refugees have already received4 favourable replies to their petitions to be allowed to return to their homes. The appointment of Count von 19adasd to be Minister of Justice is said by the Viennese to be a compliment paid to the Hungarian nationality, but the Hungarians declare that they do not consider it one. Count Nadaid, the chief of one of the most ancient Magyar families, is Lord Steward of the Kingdom of Hungary, and hereditary Lord-Lieutenant of the county of Comorn, but he is by no means popular in Hungary, as he is one of the leaders of the so-called Austrian party. In the evening of the 14th the Pope arrived at Loretto. His Holiness was persuaded by the deputations sent to him from Fermo and Arcola to visit those towns, and he consequently only arrived at Ancona yesterday, instead of on the 18th, as had been originally arranged. The A1ysbusr.qGazette learns from Ancona that the Austrian screw steamer Radetzky arrived at that place on the 14th inst., and that a French frigate was also expected. On the same authority it may be stated that the Archduke Ferdinand Maximiliarn intends to go to Ancona to pay his respects to the Sovereign Pontiff. On the 14th General Count Degenfeld, the Commander of the Austrian troops in the Papal Legations, and Major-General Baron Lederer, the Austrian Commander in Bologna, arrived at Ancona, and left almost immediately for Loretto. According to a private letter from Rome, Pius IX., who is a maost benevolent man, has undertaken his journey in order to see and judge for himself of the real state of things in his dominions. It has already been settled by the Papal Government that a limited amnesty shall be granted, " but Cardinal Antonelli fears that His Holiness may desire to do more than has been agreed on, and consequently he has taken care to place persons who enjoy his (Antonelli's) full confidence in the suite of the Pope." This morning, at 11 o'clock, a document was signed by which the Austrian Government guarantees 8 per cent. per annum to the Danubian Steam Navigation Company for the loss of the privilege which gave it the exclusive right of navigating that part of the Danube which runs through theAustrian empire. The guarantee, which is up to the year 1880, secures to the shareholders S per cent. per annum without any kind of deduction. The Jupiter has arrived from London at frieste, and will soon be followed by the Pluto and Neptune, -which have been built for the Austrian Lloyd's, and are to run between Constantinople and Tleste. RUSSIA. (FRoM oUra BRium connnPoXDir.) BERLIN, MAY 24. The dearth of political news which I lately mentioned as obtaining in the Russian pr amounts 'now to a total sen Ee the cPoerioup and l nw t atotl bsence. Even the contentious and pugnacious Notherm Bee has sheathed its poHtical sting, and the Invalide, in spite of its military character and, antecedents, has betaken itself to the consideration of the British constitution and legislation. The special subjects to which it has as yet devoted its energies are the law of divorce in England, and the constituent elements of the British Parliament. These articles do not offer anything that I can resolve upon offering to your readers. This total cessation of political matter in the Russian press, which becomes remarkable from the fact of a great amount of liberty and expansiveness having been permitted to it of late, is attributed by the faintb hearted to a change in the views of the GovernI ment, which are supposed to be returning to the old repressive and restrictive system, but it is much more probable that the phenomenon is the result solely of the change of the seasons in nature, for we find the same alteration take place at the same time at all the northern capitals-St. Petersburg, Berlin, Copenhagen, and Stockholm. At the approach of winter, when the severity of the climate xmakes all out-of-doors employment impossible, Government and society in these h yperborean regions swarm up to the capital, and devote themselves to the business of the State and the labours of diplomacy,-public offices in the morning and the ball-room in the evening; but when spring returns, which it does suddenly after four or five months of ice and snow, neither legislators nor diplomatists are to be any longer retained in town, and the publio journals are, of necessity, left without subjects for their lucubrations. The new-born Grand Duke, who is the sixth child anid the fifth son of the Imperild couple, has been christened Sergiuv, a nanm which for a very long time past has not figured in the annals of the 'Inperial family. Almst simultaneously with,- his entrance int this wo,ld and his, admisaion into the church he waa nominated to be chef of the Tobolak Regiment of Infantry and of the 2d battalioti oE the Rifles of the-Body Guard; and he is further inscribed on the musterroll of the Preobraschepske Regiment of the Infantry of the Guard,, tbe EmPeror's Regiment of Hussars of the Guard, the lat Brigado of the Artilery of 'the Guard, and the battalion of the Rifles? of the Imperial family. The Tobolrk Regiment of Infanitry is in future to be called after the name of its juvenile chef-Sergius. The Empress appears to be going on well. Some of the bulletins, however betrayed that there had been moments when aZl was not going on as well as could ba vi,hed. Itapears that the Imperial lady on thii occasion met with one of those conretemps "w which sometimea will happen even in the best regulitedc families ;" thesymptoms of the approaching ev,ent were shortly before the birth so totally in abeyance that the celebrated aceoucheur who had come from abroad to assrit with- his professional servicesobtained the Emperor's permission, in company with Lis brother Esculapius, to leave Zar:koe-, selo and go to wee the siglts of' St. retersburg.. No sooner were the two snedici engaged in the pleasures of sight-seeing than the telegraph had to. be put into requisition to call them back to the bedaide of their patient. In the early part of the month the navigation at the ports of Cronstadt and St. Petersburg became, very brisk; Uptof the 13th inst. 286 vesels had already left the ormer port, and 22 bad arrived. Threevessels had been no injured by the floatingjice. that they sank. 0n the I4th, however, large quantitiea of ice came down the Neva from the Like of Ladoga, and the temperature; which had previously been up to 12 Reaumur, mink so rapidly that sleet fell in abundanca every body was obliged to take to fires again, and, if posible, to put,up their double windows. The water communi- cation between St. Petersburg and Cronstadt was,, in consequence of the quantity of ice that caine 'floating lown the Neva, quite interrupted. Since tZe 1st inst. there have been new regulations in force at Cronstadt with regard to the treatmint of travellers arriving or leaving; formerly a traveller 'on ariving at Cronstadt had to undergo a lengthy examaination; his' birth, parentage, education, prospects, and intentionswere enteredintothree different lists, and his luggage was subjected to a very searching investigation by the doftaniets before h copld be allowed to proceed thence to St. Petersburg * now the captain of the vessel has to prepare this threefold list in a simpler form and during the passage. Thesa lists and the passports are examined in (Cronstadt and with very little delay and no unnecesary moestation the traveller is for-warded to St. Petexsburg, where his luggage passes rapidly through the Custom-house. Together with his passport, which he gets back at Cronstadt, the foreigner receives printed instructions drawn up in several different languages as to the course requisite to obtain from the police a permissio,n de sdjour. Persons leaving Russia are also relieved from the necesaityof getting their passports entered at various public offices previous to departing, and their luggage is no longer subjected to a search now that the export of gold has ceased to be prohibited. The Post-office is beginning to take some steps ia the way of reform; as great dissatisfaction ai-res from the lengthy detention of the foreign newspapers by the officers of the Censorship, and the Post-office apparently gets the whole blame of the delay, it will in future impress on each copy a stamp indicating the time of its arrival, so that the public I may put the saddle on the right horse. This institution has numerous sins of its own to answer for; for instance, after proclaiming that letters for foreign parts cannot be forwarded under a prepostage envelope, they leave all letters so enclosed and directed to persons in foreign countries to lie quietly in the post-office, and once a month the addresses of these detenus are published with an invitation to the writers to come and fetch them away. In last month's list there were no less than a round dozen of letters for the Countess Zenaide Graziani in Vienna. Why the officials do not avail themselves of the obvious resources adopted in other countries of opening the letters and sending them baek to their writers is a mystery,-particularly in a country where the opening and reading of letters for foreign parts is the rule, as in other countries it is only the exception. It may be assumed confidently that every letter before it leaves the Russian Post-offlce, if it be not stamped with the seal of a' vrell-known and unsuspected house, or marked with the name of a respected and unsuspected person as the writer, will infalibly be opened and read. The process observed is this. Where the impression of the seal is bold it is laid on a piece of soft metal, and a sharp blow administered to it from the front side of the letter with a mallet; the wax is broken into fragments and dust, but the impression remains sunk in intaglio on the metal, which thus forms a die, with an effigy that is a perfect counterpart of the writer's seal, ready for use. A letter fastened with a wafer previous to sealing it gives a good deal more trouble; in this case a fine jet of gas is directed by means of a blow-pipe against the wax in a circle all round the wafer and the impression, and the wax being melted and the paper being burnt through in that circular line there is no further impediment to the letter being opened, while the impression remains uninjured on the back. When the letter has been read and closed again the gas jet is again put in requisition to fill up the perforation of the wax by fusing the neighbouring parts, and the whole seal looks as if nothing had happened to it. This system of letter espionage is carried on still to as great an extent as under the old rhgime of the Emperor Nicholas, and so notorions and excessive has it become that our Government can no longer trust even our consular despatehes by the Russian post, but the country must be put to the expense of Cabinet couriers to convey them. The Railwfay Nietwvork shares have been already rTn up to a premium of 4i roubles upon the 125rouble share. THE STATE OF NAPLES. (FROM OIJB OW?N CORRESPONDEN.) , ~~~~~NAPLES, LAY 18. The case of the Montesarchio prisoners has been re-opened by a recent visit paid to them by two English gentlemen. Both of them are men of high integrity, and incapable of making any false statements; still there can be no doubt but that they desired to see things otherwise than they had been represented, and that therefore, if not their hononr, at least their bias requires to be watched. Tao honour, or rather the correctness, of your correspondent is deeply concerned in any counter-statements wbich may be made to his, or in any effort made to create an impression of his unfairnes. While, therefore, I defy any one to set aside the evidence on which my reports have rested, I will |give you such details of the recent visit as I have been able to collect, asking you, at the same time, to put perfect reliance on those details. The visit to which I allude was made on Sunday, the 10th of May, and of course was made by superior per- l mission. It was the first time for upwards oi six: years that these suffering men had been permitted to graqp the friendly hand of humane and honourable men, and I believe all were equally moved. The visitors, who were accompanied by all the authorities during the whole time, stated that they had come to learn the truth, and while they were treated with every courtesy by the officers as a matter of course, theycommunicated with egch prisoner separately, in the presence of the authorities, though at a little distance. Of the past whenever tbe prisoners wished to speak they were by the visitors dincouraged to allude to it. Their hearts were swelling with the recollection of imprisonment in underground caverns, where the damp dropped from the walls, of nights passed on the ground, of their being chained two togethersometimes chained to the ground, of injuries and insults, and menaces; but they were told, however, not to allude to the past-bygones were bygones; but these details were a part of tbe history of the past, the suppression of which would amount to a deception on the pablic, and would lead to the honour of the Corre-. spondents of journals being caUed in question. Besides, was it possible for flesh and blo d to forget such physical and moral tortures as thoie wbich bad been inflicted through a long course of years ? But now let us come to the actual condition of the prisoners. We will admit for a moment that they have a' much champagne as the TaM et will allow them; but they drink it with aw chain round their leg-a chain of five links, each link, iE is now an e3tablished fact. They may live on the top of a inouintsain dommtanding a' wide Irange of view, badt it is no less truie thit at the time the statemeut- was made tho -damp was so great that bread became moaildy in alshort time, and that the pritoners auffered severely in their limb3, and that one died of consuliption. They enjoy each bther' saocietyjfor they live four or five in a room,. but parent, or wife, or child; iip to this time, tbey have not been permitted ta see, except through a double row of iron bars aften palms distant. A Royal rescript has been issued, giving special permission to Nisco to wee hisawife alone, and her pas3port is now in course of preparation to make a journey of some 30 miles. They may be in possession of a.s good health as the circumances permit, but . some four or. -.five were ia hospital at the time of the visit. P'ironti was suffering from paralysis of the.limbs ths effect of damp prisons. He wat?t leaning o- cratche and w.ithout them he could not put foot to the ground. He has been suffering for four y^a3. Schixvoni has lost an eye, also from the e f cloe and damp imprisonment, and is in imulient danger of lobing -.another, Garcia is confined to the room,. an invalid, and has become 3o in consequence of 30 lashes. which he received(reducedfroOliis sentence of 50), and which, if report be true, brougtit on hernia and spitting of blood. Such is the state of the political prisoners of Montesarchio, and no one can gainy the stAtement; but I ihouid not be telling the whole truth were I not to ad that-for a month or a little more their sufferings aI' e been in some degree alleviated by the appointment of a neow commander and a new inspector of polie, who, though strict in the execution of their dut, do not forget that they are men. Still, cotamaudeand inspectors have bteen changed 'from time io time, and the afevtations which depend on the petsonal character 0't the superiors haive no great gua rantees. Forgetfulness of the past and hope for the future were recommended to the prisones ,by the visitors. Wha' are the grounds of these sweet illusions t In December last |the authoritiens timated or insinuated that thle political prisoners might have theii liberty for the asking. Men who had never been tried asked bat receivednot. TenprisolersinMontesarchio, of whom I can give the names of Schiavone, Stagliano, Pica, Nisco, and Braica, sent in petitions for indulgeneo, but on the 10th of My they were still enjoying thWe luxurious views from the heights of Montesarchiod, and drinkian the TaUet's champagne with a chaif e 's. Aftei a seaon of painful expectation in the Royal family, Hler Majesty was conflnetl on the 28th of February, but, instead of awakeing compassion for the political prisoners,h decree was publis'hed on the 3d of March by w.hich some of the worst criminals received a dimsnution of punishment, or were let loose on societ5, possibly leading to the melancholy event which ritish sulbjects have so recently deplored. On the 3d of May the Intendente of the province visited thb Bagno of Monitesairchio, and in the Royal name offered the prisoners the choice of voluntary cmigra - tion to the Argentine territory. The offer was not made to Poerio, the Duke, Nisco, Mollica, Donc, Braica, or Pica, but among those to whom the gracious privilege was accorded was the cripple Fironti, and the eyeless Schiavoni. All declined but four Calabrese, whose names are Palermon Garcia, Stigliano, and Barino. I have rui over these events, which have taken place since December last, to show what reasons for forgetfulness of the past, or cheerful looking forward to the future, exist for the prisoners of Montesarchio, especially 'when they were informed that the Bagno will still be their fate. It saves a vat deal of trouble and disquietude, doubtless, to smoothe over the, surface of things, to whitewash tombs and make corruption look quite charming; but corruption is still corruption for all that, and the world never was and never will be improved by such a system. Besides, as in the actual case, it would be false to the Soveregn who is supp d to be ignorant of much that occurs, and to be desirous of ameliorating the con. dition of his subjects, to misrepresent or conceal. facts, and it would be doubly false to that great public who, inthe nameof humanity andohristianityj are called on to look after the interests of their fellow men.
THE WVRBCZ OP THE ZOE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TDE. Sir,s-Yoa td oblige e soby apowring mne to occupy a snial space of your'colnmns to enable me to do an act of jusfice to a very deserving man, the sailingmas6ter of my yacht Zoe, which was wrecked at midnight on Hasborough Sands, off tho coast of Norfolk, on the night of the 24th: I am satisfied, and have so expressed my opinion to the sailing-master in question, that no want of precaution on bis part, or of any of the crew, was the cause of the acci dent, nor was it in their power to prevent it. A fair wind was taking the vessel at the rate of eight knots an hour on her course. We had just made Cromer Light at 10.30, when the wind suddenly fell, and the vessel was in a calm drifted by a very strong tide on to the sandswhichrenders that coast so dangerous. Immediately before she struck the lead, which was constantly hove, gave 16 fathoms. I am desirous that my friends should be made awae of these circumstances, *na I would beg leave to call to the minds of all your readers how powerfully this accident is calculated to make them reflect that while, on the one hand, it may please God to frustrate our plans and our wishes, and to make us remember our entire dependence on Him, He at the same time gives us reason to be grateful and sensible of His great mercies. In this instance He has spared the lives of 20 human beings exposed to the greatest danger, and, in all human probability, beyond the means of rescue. 1 am.; Sir. wonr , hpM,nt! aaua+ YARBOR07UGFcH Ii, Arlington-street, London, MAy 26.

Tas RiGnT oF DIVORCE PMSONS TO RxrAituy.i -As some misconception may arise from the Peculiar forme of our report of the debate on the Divorceo BiUl in the House of Lords on Monday night, as regards the question whethes persons formally divorced should be allowed to marry again, it may be weU to give a precise summary of what really took place. Clause 43 enacts that " when the time limited for appealing against any decree dissolving a marriage shalL bave expired, and no appeal shaU have been presented against such decree, or when any such appeal shall have been dismissed, or when, in the result of any appeal, any marriage shall be declared to be dissolved, but not sooner, 'it shall be lawful for the respective parties thereto to marry again. as if the prioir marriage had been dissolved by death."' T'o this clause an amendment was moved by the Archbishop of Canterbury (not by the Bishop of Oxford) to lve out the words "resnective parties thereto," and insert the words "party on whose petition the marriage shal have been dissolved ;" the object of the amendment clearly being to allow the innocent or aggrieved party to remarry, and at the same time to preclude the divorced adulterer or adul-' tress from the enjoyment of the like privilege. This amendment of the most rev. prelate was carried by 63 to 47, onlytwo bishops (London and Kilmore) voting in the minority,' and one archbishop, -with 13 bishops, in the majority. The Bishop of Oxford then rose and said that, although he thought the clause was greatly improved by the amendment, he considered that it went beyond what was right and exPEdient, and he moved that it be omitted from the Bill. The amendment, however, was not pressed to a division. With the "Minutes" issued yesterday was printed the following amendnment, to be proposed by the Lord Bishop of Oxford, at the end of clause 43, viz. :-" Provided nevertheless, that inasmuch as by the law of this realm and church the bond o,f marriage hath hitherto heen indissoluble, no clerk in holy orders of the Church of England shall, after the passing of this Act, be liable to any censure, penalty, or punishment whatever, in any court, eccleFiaatical or civil, for refusingto perform the marriage service over any person or perso a who, having been married and divorced, shall seek to be married again during the lifetime of the husband or wife from whom they have been divorced under the provisions of this Act." This proviso would appear to give the clergy the option of refusing to carry out the permission granted by the said clause for the innocent (divorced) party to remarry. DAcnSE TRNnSrr DuEs.-Copies of petition% from various persons interested, to the Lords of the Trdaaury on the subject of the Danish " transit" dues, have just been published by order of Parliament. The petitioners pointed out the nece8sity of guarding trade against transit dues on traffic passing by laud through Denmark in lieu of by way of the Sound, as unless this were done no practical advantage would be secured to trade by the abolition of the Sound dues. The result of the appeal to the Danish Government by the Ministers of England has been the abolition of so much of the transit duty as was impos d for the purpose of countervailing the (abolished) Sound dues. more than this our Government did not think they had r right to require, nor did they deem it prudent, for the sake of this point alone, to risk the faUure of a Europea movement for so geat a public object as the sup. premon of the Bound dues.

The Bank will, therefore, most likely receive a further increase. The Board of Trade returns for the peat month have been issued to-day, and again show a large increase in the declared value of our exportationU, although not to the extraordinary extent observable during the three preceding maonthL The augmemtation is 560,9181., or 5 per cent, as compared with thecorrespondingperiodoflastyear, and 1,899,880., or 23 per cent., as compared with April, 1855. The annexed table exhibits the exact incre or decrease under each heado Among our staple manu-. factures linen is the only one on the unfavourable side:- DzorAm VALuj or E9rPovtkrwrnn The total increase in our exports for the first four months of the year has been rather more than 12 per cent. As compared with the corresponding four months of 1855 it iLas been about 45 per cent. With regard to imported commodities a decrease continues to be shown in the arrivals of wheat aud flour. Indian corn, however, has been largely taken. In animals and salted provisions there has again been an increase, consequent upon the advancing prices of meat. The importations of coffee and tea show a reduction, while in the deliveries for home consumption there has been an immense increase, owing to the dealers having waited till the commnencement of the month for the reduction of duties. Of wines, spirits, and tobacco the arrivals have been very large, bat the consumption has not exceeded the average. Subjoined are the quantities of provisions, &c., imported and taken for home consumption:- in thie miscelaneous imports there has been a general and important increase, sufficient with that shown in the above quoted articles of raw material to explain in a great degree the continued demand for bullion. Of dyes and dyeing stuffs, hides, leather manufactures, metals, and timber the quantities landed have been far in excess of those received in April, 1855.

THE PRINCESS ROYAL'S 10wRy.-We do not consider the settlement on the Princess Royal extravagant in amount, but the manner in which it has been discussed and disposed of in the House of Commons seems to us objectionable and puerile. All deliberation on the question appears to have been deprecated and hushed down. To talk upon the subject beforehand was pronounced premature, and to talk upon it after it was mooted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer was decried as disrespectful to the Crown. All this was very unbecoming a representative assembly. In fact, the Parliament of a great and wealthy nationshould have been above the suspicion of illiberality in a pecuniary question in which the eldest daughter of the Queen was concerned, and the utmost scope afforded fur the consideration of the best mode of conferring the public donation. The manner in which the settlement was made involved some very important interests both to the country and to the Royal family. The Queen has more daughters, and the ase of the Princess Royal will doubtless be taken as a precedent in that of all the others. Session after session, indeed, for some years we may expect an application for dowers andannuities, followed by marriages by which the Royal family of this country will become most intimately related to the various Courts of Europe. It is very important, therefore, in our opinion, to consider what pecuniary tie shall subsist in future years between the British people and the children of the Queen. The form of annuity is liable to grave objections, and in the case of war or alienation with foreign States might raise discussions and awaken. bad feelings which all would have reason to deplore. On the other. hand, a sum of money paid down-once for all, and invested, as it probably would be, in the country with which our Princesses intermarried, has the inconvenience of exposing them, in the event of revolutions such as we have seen in continental States, to confiscation and poverty. This diffi culty, however, might be obviated by placing the dowers under trustees, and requiring their investment, wholly or-in. p art, in this country. Under a provision of this nature, a liberal marriagea portion paid down once for all seems to us the best for all parties, and it is to be regretted that thle House of Commons did not discuss the mattsr in a more manly and businesslike way.-Glatsow 41ci4
BAILWAY INyELLImGEcE. - - - M31ONMOuTHSsiuB I'* um" a-Yea meeting of this company was held on Wedneay at Ne.wport, Mr. T. W. B. Biakemore, MP., in the chfr. The rePrt, An abstract of which has appeared in 2%c Tnime was taken as read. The CBAIRMAN, in moving the adoption of the report, congratulated the shareholders on the satisfactory and prosperous condition of their affairs. The revenue was increasing in every department, and the expenditure had been reduced. The total incomo derived fruo the traffic was for the half-year ending December31 1 855,53,4011., and for the half-year ending December 31,1856, it had increased to. 57,9261. The working expenses for the former period amounted to 35,0691., or 65.A per cent., and for the latter period to only 31,2311., or 54 per cent., and he thought they could not reasonably expectthe line to be worked at a lower rate, and if they kept within that percentage he thought no shareholder would have reason to find fault. The working expenses being deducted, there remained a balance of 26,6941. After paying the interest on debentures, preference shares, outstanding debts, and all other ch ,they had a disposable balance of 10,3421., out of which the committee recommended a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum, payable on the 30th of June next, leaving a blance of 1,U1. to be carried forward to the next account. The dividend for the preceding half-year was at the rate of 4 per cent., while they were now enabled to give a dividend at the rate of 5 pe et., after adding to tho reserve fund 3,5001. This shoedr thatbtheir affir were ien- prosperous and progressive state. With regard to the traffic uring the current half-year, it had, kept up at the same rate of progress, and there was every probability that they would be able at the next meeting to. declare a dividend at least equal to that which they -were now about to declare. 'Mr. W. E. SNrow, in seconding the motion for the. adop. tion of the ret t it a most extraorcdinary thing that sly, months should intervene between closing the acounts and recdving the dividend. He thought it wvould be desirable to liave adairect commrunication with Merthyr Tydvil, which would give them a great accession of traffic. They might also do something in respect torunning Sunday excursion trains for the accommodation of the inhabitants of Newport and other places on the line. Mr. C. LYNE bdieved that if the suggestion made by Mr. Snow were adopted it would prove a great boon to the working classes, and would be a most desirable advantage both in regard to their physical and moral condition. The CEnAuLsi, in reply, stated that the period for the payment of the dividend was entirely ifi the hands of the thareholders; they could recommend an earlier date forthe payment of ihe dividend if thev thought proper. With regard to the suggestion for the renewa of the Sunday trafflc system, very erious consideration had been given to the matter some time ago, and the result was that the faes had been reduced, so as to allow the woiking classes an oppor. tualty of making excursions on Sundays into the country. They soon, however, had remonstrances from the clergy and rinisters of all denominations, as well as from large numbers of the respectable inhabitants, in consequence of which the practice was abandoned. The directors would be most appy to adopt any measure that would insure the public Resolutions were passed adopting the report, declaring a dividend at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum on the ordi. naryshares, and authorizing the directors to borrow67,6001 when the shares created in 1855 were fully subscribed for and one half the amount l.aid up. A vote of thanics to the chairman concluded the proceedings. MANCHESTER, SH1EFEIELD, AND LINCOLNSHIE The workng expenses and other outgoings of this company's railways (exclusive of the Manchester, South Junction, and Altrincham, stated below) have amounted in the fortnight ending May 17 to 9,3381. 13s. 6d., while the corresponding period of 1856 amounted to 8,5511. 4. lIld. The sum of 84,1981. Us. 7d., already stated for the first nine fortnights of the half-year, added to the 9,3381. 13s. 6d. as above, makes a total expended of 93,5371.

Os. 5d. in the expenditure. BRADFORD, WAKEFIELD, AND LEEDS. Yesterday theo general m~eeting of this company was held at Brdford; Mr. Firth, chairman, presided. Mr. T. H. Carr, the secretary, read the report, which stated that the principal works remaining to be completed at the commencement of the month were 114,000 cubic yards of earthwork and 3A mhiles of the perm1anent way. The time for opening the line depended upon the completion of the earthwork. There were still 50,000 cubic yards to be removed from one end of the Wrenthorpe cutting, and about the same quantity of excavation to be removed at the southern end of the tunneL. Mr. Hawkshaw, the engineer, went over the whole of the works on the 16th inst, and impressed on the contractor, who accompanied him, as strongly as he could the necessity of using every exertion to complete the works without delay. The capital account showed 163,1521. received and 164,6021. expended, lesving 1,4501. due to the bankers. The CHAIRMAN, in moving the adoption of the report, stated that the line would probably be opened by the lst of August next-. Mr. J. AcrRmToN soconded the adoption of the report, which was unanimously agreed to. A vote of thanks to the chairman concluded the pro. ceedliugs. TILBURY, MAlDON, AND COLCHESTER. Yesterday a mecting of shareholders in this project was held at the Town-hall, Colcheeter, to consider the present position of the undertaking. MIr. Brown was called to the chair. The CHAIRMrAN stated that the project had unfortunately faen to the ground, in consequence of an arrangement enteredl into with the Eastern Counties Company. On Friday a deputation of the directors had an interview with the Eastern Counties directors, and Mr. Love, the chairman, who received them very pohtely, promised in general terms that every facility shouldl be givett for the extension of the trade of the town and neighbourhood. Arrangements were subsequently made for having an interview with Sir Morton Peto on Monday afternoon, and when the interview took place Sir Morton promised that the deposits should be immediately returned in full, with interest from the date of payment at the rate of 5 per coat, per annum. The deputation impressed upon ir Morton Peto the necessity of puttin into their hands the plans, surveys, &c. (which had cost a heavy sum), provided the line should go on at some future time, as the Maldon rgentlemen and those between Madon and Pittsea were anxious it should, if only a single line of rails were laid down. Sir MSorton Peto promised that if the scheme came upon the carpet within three or four years, or any future time, the plans should heavailable and if an Act were obtained a fair compensation for the expense to which he had been put would be al that he would require. With regard to his interference or assistance in the scheme, it would be influenced by the position he might then hold-friendly or antagonistic-with regard to the Eastern Counties Company. Mr. BARNES said, the provisional directors, as far as they were concerned, had known nothing of the arrangements which had taken place between Sir Morton Peto and the atern Counties Company with regard to the Ea t Suffolk line. At the interview on Monday Sir Morton Peto had expressed his great regret that the provisional directors had not been communicated with before any arrangement was made for the disposal of the line ; and he assuredl the deputation that it was. his full intention that they should have been made acquainted with what was going ou. The reason assigned for the abanxdonment of the line was the adverse state of the money-market. thcorefwIh TuRNEB (town-clerk), 31z. TATYLOR, hlr.

The action -as brought by the plaintiff, formerly a clerk in the South-Eastrn RailwaT Company, to recover damages for the conversion of four letters of testimonial which the plaintiffhad deposited with the company when he entered their servioe, but whioh the company had failed to deliver up to him when he left, on the ground that they could not be found. At the trial which took place before Mr. Justice Coleridge, at Guildball, at the sittings after last term, it appeared that the testimonials had been delivered to one of the defendants named Wells, who was cashier in the goods department at the Bricklayer.' Arms Station; and according to his evidence they had been afterwards handed, with the plaintifr's consent, to Shaw, the goods manager, in order to be shown by him to the manager of the Royal Swedish Railway. Shaw, however, had no recolection that he had ever had them, and he could not find them in his office, Eis Lordship, in the first instanoe, thought there was no evidenoe of conversion; but ultimately he left the facts to the jury, who found for the plaintiff, with 191. lOs. damages. His Lordship thereuwon directed the verdict to be entered for the defendants, and gave the plaintiffleave to move to enter the verdict in hs favour for the damages aessed if She Court should be of opinion thattherewas any evidence of conversion. The learned serjeantnow contended that there was abundant enidence of conversion. lord CAPBELL said he could not see that there was any eonversion. The plaintiff ought to have declared upon a bailment and neglect to redeliver. After a good deal of discussion, The COURT granted a rule to amend and have a new trial on the payment of costs. THE QUEEN V. DARE. Mr. EDWIN JAMEs, Q.C. (with whom was Mr. Need. ham) moved for a rule calling upon James Dare, the publisher of the Weston-aup.afare Me-cur/, to show cause why a criminal information should not be filed against him fo: a libel published in that journal on the 19th of May last The application was made on the part of Mr Stringfield, a gentlemen who bad taken Fome interest in the introduction of a German band into Weston-super-Mare. The defendant, on the other hand, was interested in the support of what was termed the town band; and from this rivalry anything rather than harmony had resulted. Mr. Dare, whohad a strong malevolent feeling against Mr. Stringfield, arising from his having been sued by him, published the article now complained of on the 19th of May inst., and headed it, " Weston-super-Mare Promenade Band." The learned counsel said the article was in the form of an allegory, and imputed to the applicant great cruelty to his own fatber, and accused him of being an unnatural son. The libelwas read at length, but it was very obscure in its innuendoes, which, however, the learned counsel said were clearly understood by the applicant's friends, who had made affidavits. The applicaut, in the most distinct manner, denied aii the facts stated in the libel, and derosed tbat so far was he from being guilty of any of the acts of hfuelty charged against him, that he bore a large share of the support of his father at a public institutionl. Lord CAmnBErL.-We think you ought to take a rale to sshow cause. Rule niti granted. HELDER V. BEAUIONT, Mr. Lvus moved, pursuant to leave reserved at the trial, for a rule to enter the verdict for the defendant. The question raied by a rejoinder to a replication on equitable grounds was whether the plaintiff, who had proved under the defendant's bankruptcy for his debt, could recover the amount of a premium which had become due upon a life p<licy on the defendant's life effected to secure the debt. The ramo question was raised by demurrer. The COURT granted a rule to show cause. IIDEER V. SALISBURY. This was an action of detenue of a bottomry bond, and also for an assault and false imaprisonment. At the trial which took place before Mr. Justice Coleridge at GunidhallD at the sittings after last term, the plaintiff obtained a verdict, with 7501 damages, for the detention of the bond, and U. for the assault, &c. Mr. Serjeant SHEE now moved for a rule to show cause why there should not be a new trial, on the ground that the verdict was against the evidence. Mr. Justice COLERIDGE said he was not quite pleased with the verdict. Lord CAmPBELL said the learned serxeant might take a rule to show cause generally. DE LA RUE AND OTEHERS V. DICKENSON AND OTIERS. The plaintiffs in this action were Meesrs. De la Rue snd Co., the manufacturers of envelopes, and they sued the defendants, Messrs Dickenson and Co., who were engaged in the same manufacture, to recover damages for the infringement of two patents granted to the plaintiffg. The first of the two patents was dated the 17th of March, 1845, and was granted for improvements in the mode of folding envelopes; and the second patent was dated the 19th of December, 1849, for an improved method of gumming the tame. At the trial, which took placo before Lord Campbell at Gnildhall, ar the sittings after last Hilary Term, It appeared, that previous to the date of the plaintiffs' second patent, via, on the 28th of August, a Frenchman named Remond had talken out a patent for " improvements in maehinery for folding envelopes, and in the manufacture of envelopes ;" and the defendants had been induced in November, 1850, to purehase the patent for 3,A000,, on the assurance that it could be worked without infringin on the plaintiffs' patents, It was, however, contended by 'th plAianiffs-fIrst, that the machine made by the defendats tidg Rmn' patent was an infringement ofthepan tili-'$olding process patented in 1845; and secondly that the gummimg process adopted by the defendanta, which s an approvement on Remond's, was an infririgement of the process atented in 1849. This was ee d by edefendants, who contended that Remond.a inVeD jtion was totally different from the plaintiffsl', and had notbijs analogona in it. A good eal od evidence wsu sien on f)eee points upon both aides, whikb occupied the Cour for gio days. It esemed toebe admittea en the trial Utat machine being an infringement of the plaintis pPatent, it was avetP menikious miachine, and not only more atimle in its -constrction, but more eaectul in its OPemtiop.

Mr. Atherton and Mr. Field were onsel for the plann. tiff. and M. Ki,owles and Mr. Wills forthe defendant. It Appeared. that by,a deed executed by John LAwrenoe he covenanted to pay the pl&aitiff IOL. a-weak during the life Of his (LAwrnce's) wife, but he had oseted to pay it. and therefore the action was %rought.

In this case r. WHATELEY, Q.C. (with whom waa Mr. Cooke), moved to set aeide an order of Mr. Justice Willes obtained at Monmouth Asies in the cause, orderingthe plaintiffs to convey to the defendanta the wiole of their in. terest in a certain pieca of land in Wxles in oonsideration of 400g. paid by the defendants. In 1831 the property was purchased by a gentleman named Anson of a Mr. Austin and in 1837 ar. Anson left his property to trustees and to his nephewtobedivided. Theyadmittedaman named Powell as tenant of the landsin question, whichwere apparently of little value, on an agreementto payarental ofs30s. a-year. The land, however, turned out to hava vialuable minerals under it. In 1854 the trustees found it vacant, Powell having left tbe country, and attempted to obtain possession of it as a vacant possession, when certain parties named Graham, and wee, ad Evans were let in to defend the posseseion in proceedings in ejectment, they claiming title So it. it seemed these parties had found ahi old settlement deed relating to this land, and had persuaded Powell to conve the land to them as mort. gagees for , under wrich deed they claimed the land, which was said to be worth 3,000. By boxating of the old deed and of their title the defendants' attorney tad persuaded the plaintiffs' attoruey toagree to compro- ilse the action, and to convey the land for 400k to the defendants. In point of fact, the defendants title wras a pure phantom; they had no title whatever, and tLe whole proceeding was a fraudulent one. Rule niasw granted. JONS V. MARSEALL. In this case Mr. HONEYN" showed cause against a rule for discharging the defendant, an attorney, from arrest on the ground of privilege; and Mr. Hodgson appeared in su port of the rule, The defendant, it appeared, was attending the Lord Mayor's Court as the attorney for the bail to an action, when he was arrested on a ca. a It was submitted that as he was not attending as attorney for either party to the action he had no prilvilege from arrest. In support of the rule Gascoigne's case, in the 14th Vesey, was relied upon, where a solicitor returning home from attending his client's business at iancoln's-inn Haull was arrested;; he was ordered to be discbargedl. The LORD COEF usTmc ws of opinion that this rule should be discharged. It was essential for the administration of Justice that those attendig for parties in an action sould be privilegedfrom arrest; hut no precedent could bc shown extending the privilege to attorneys attending for some one brought collaterally lntO a cause. Such an extension of the privilege would be attended with dangerous consequences. Rule discharged, with oosts. (Sittings at Zi.si Prius, at Weeminster, before Err. Justice CROWvDER and a Common Jury.) This was the first day of the first sittings at Westminster in Trinity Term. TURNER V. BBRnTAINT AND ANOTH. Mr. Prentice and ur. Sawyer were counsel for the plaintiff; and Mr. IL Chambers, Q.C., and Mr. Petersdorff appeared for the defendants. This was an action brought by the plaintiff a grocer and rilkman, carrying on bnsiness In Westbourne-street, Pimlco, to reeover damages for expulsion from his house and for an excessive distrss alleged to have been levied by one of the defendants as landlord, and by the other as his broker. This cause was tried during last term, and a short report of it was given in The Times, but the jury, being unable to agree upon a verdict, were discharged. The evidence adduced on the present trial was, with some exceptions, of a similar nature to that given on the former occasion, and the real point at issue seemed to be the value of the furniture seinde, the plaintiff estimating it at 301, and the defendants oontending that it was worth very little, in fact not sufficient to cover the amount of the rent due at the time of the distress The jury eventually found a verdict for the plaintiff on the first count of the declaration, dmiages one farthing, and on the otber counts also for the plaintiff, damagea 51.
COURT OF EXCHEQUER. TuESDAY. MA - 2R HIGGnS V. BARTO1r. (siting in Ba&nco.) --,1 - au aetion or trover, to recover the value of three bales of silk, under the following circumstances, elicited on the recent trial before Mr. Baron Martin :-The plaintiff is & warehouseman in the cityand thedefendant an auctioneer It seems that the plaintiff must have had dealings with Mr. Fitzgibbon, one of the principal mercbants and now Mayor of Cork, for he was induced by tho false representation of a man named Dicks that he was the agent of that gentleman, with authority to buy on his account, to part with three hales of silk. Wheni the fraud was discovered it turned out that Dicks had taken the silk to the defendant, and obtained an advance of 60. on one of the bales, after which they were all sold, and the proceeds handed over to him bv the defendant. Under this state of facts the learned Baron was of opinion, on tho authority of "KIngsford v. Merry," that the property in the goods remained in the plaintiff who had been deprived of the possession of them by the fraud of Dicks, and that le was entitled to recover their value from the defendant. A verdict was thereupon entered for the plaintiff for 196& 13s., subject to a motion to enter averdict for the defendant. l Mr. SLADE (with whom ws Mr. Kingdon) now moved in pursuanceo the leave so reserved, contending that as the defenidant had acted bon4flde, and without notice, he was not liable. The COURT, however, were all of opinion that the ruling of' the learned Baron at the trial was quite correct. It was clear that no property could be acquired in the goods of the plaintiff by Dicks by hisown fraud, nor could he confer any on the defendant, to whom he had handed them over. The plaintiff therefore had a right to demand them or their value from the defendant, who could not acquire any title to themby reason of any dealings with Dicks, however bona fide and innooent they might be. The rule must therefore be refused. Rule refused. (Sisngs at Nit! Pr.us, before Mr. Baron CHANrLL and Common Juries.) PLThMR V.

Anne Beade, the servant at No. 22, Torrington.plaee, was cleaning the doorsteps of that house at about 8 o?clock on the morningof the l4thinsL, wahen she observedDillon lurking about m front of the adjoining house, No. 21, the residenoe of Mr. Alexander Aikman, a shipowner. Looking up at the parlour window, which was open, she saw Bazr standing on the inside, holding a silver waiter in one hand, and wit the other beckoning to Dillon. The latter wa approaching the spot, but peroeived that she ws watching ham, and ran away. At that moment Barr had turned bia back for a moment, and was taking from a sideboad another waiter. Beade then went in front of the house, and beckoned to Mr. Aikman's servant, Mary Tizzard. who was in the kitchen below. She came tothe street door, and Beade told her what had occurred. They entered the room and found Barr nding by the wi ow, with the waiters on the table and sofa at eithei' side of him. Mr. Aikman was sent for, and the prisoner avowed that he had got in through the window to- steal the plate, adding that he did so at the instigation of a strange man and boy. He then produced from his pocket a' small case, which he gave up to Mr. ikman, andwrhich contained a diamond ring worth 2. Hehad taken It from the mantelpiece. Teo waiters were valued at 201. each.

She had seen it there safe at the time he entered the shop. She offered him sixpence for the coins, which he refusedo toatake; and he bwent away. After he had left she missed the teapot. After awhiletheprisoner,with thegreat-est effrontery, returnedtotheshop, and again producing thetwo coins said he would take sixpence for them. She charged him with stealing the teapot, which he denied, and offerec to satisfv her that he was an honest respectable boy if she would allow him to go in charge of the foreman to fetch his parents, who lived near Russell squsre. This was agreed to, and the prisoner took Pavey to some back street in the neighbourhood in question, and got him into a house, where he was set upon and hustled by a man and three women, who detained him while the prisoner escaped.

A RICH NEsT.-A few days since, as a young lad belonging to Perth was passing through a wood near Logleailnond, he accidentally came upon a nest containing nine eggs. As he had never previously seen eggs of tibe same colour, and was curious to know to what kind of birds they belonged, he brought them with bim to Perth, and submitted them to a dealer in game. The lad's surprise may be imragined when the dealer told him he would give him Is. 6d. for eaeh of them.

TRA2SPORTATXOION AND PBISONDISCIPLINE. The tbird adjourned meeting was held at the Mansion. house at 1 o'clock yeaterday, the Lord Mayor presiding. The attendauce, although a litele more numerous than at the last Sitting, flled only a smal portion of the Eptian Eiall ; and the discussion, although perhaps somewat less desutory than that which occurred on the 18th mst., entirely lacked the interest derivable froma Succession of new speakere. Mr. GREER, M.P., again gave in his adhesion to 3Mr. C. -Pearson's plan of prison discipline, while Mr. LBUAITRE propounded aseheme of his own, by which the profits of the convict's labour should bh divided into three equal portions, the first of which should go to support the gaol in which he is confined, the second be applied to his own sustenance, and the third be given as a restitution to the victims of his fraud or theft. To check the gigantic railway and banking defalcations, by which so many unhappy shareholders have recentlv suffered, Mr. Lemaitre also suggested the establishment of a. board of public censors, with power to make delinquent managers and directors disgorge their ill-gotten wealth. This connter-project was-at first treated by the chairman and the meeting as being rather a supplement than a rival to Mr. Pearson's plan ; bat it was ultimately got rid of by a promise that it should be considered in committee. Mr. W. R. BALL, who lately returned from a sojourn of 17 years in the colonies, gave it as his decided opinion, that so great is the demand for labour in New South Wales its inhabitants would gladly receive a large number of our convicts after they had undergone a proper probationary training. Sir T. TANCRED reiterated his views respecting the sepsration of reformation from punishment, and accused Mr. Pearson of omitting the punitive element from his prison system. The hon. baronet also remarked, that having a plan of his own on this subject, he and Mr. Pearson might be regarded as " two of a trade," but he did not go on to quote that part of the proverb which defines the relations usualy subsisting between persons so situated. The speaker was proceeding to enforce the principle that as a preliminary to the process of his own reclamation the offender should undergo a definite punishment pronounced by the sentence of a judge, when the impatience of the meeting compeJled him to desist. After a few words from Mr. Rows, Mr. C. P&AnsoN rose to reply, pronising to confine him. self within the limits of one hour. He sketched the details and estimates incident to his scheme as submitted to the committee of the House of Commons six or seven years ago. Plans and specifications of his proposed prisons had, he said, been laid before that committee by Mr. Stephens, the eminent architect, and endorsed by Mr. Tite, ALP. He computed that the total cost of erecting, by free labour, a prison for 1,000 prisoners, according to his system, including land purchase, buildings, and enclosing wall, would not exceed 80.0001., or 801. per prisoner; whereas the eost of Pentonville Prison was 1701. per prisoner; that of Reading gaol, 2001. per prisoner; Milibank, 5121. per prisoner; and York Prison even as high* as 1,20ul. per prisoner. Colonel Jebb, Inspector.General of Prisons, had admitted the accuracy of this calculation, while Colonel Chcsterton, who had. been governor of Coldbath-fields Prison for 25 years, also bore strong testimony to the merits of the scheme. Moreover, one of the first contractors of the day was prepared, on his own respondbility, to buy the land, construct the wall and building, and also no manage the prison, subject to Government discipline, on condition that he received 61. per annum for each of the prisoners, in addition to the profits accruing from their labour. Mr. Pearson estimated the annual charge of food and clothing for 1 000 prisoners at 9,5501., while a further sum of 4,00010. wolAd provide for the salaries of 100 officers to watch over them. The earnings of l,000 prisoners would average about 16,0001. per annum. Having dilated upon hie salutary influence of labour sentences in making convicts the voluntary instruments of their own maintenance, reformation, andrelease, and avowedhisbelief thatour various colonies would actuaUy compete with each other for a class of emigrants who had undergone such an ordeal, Mr. Pearson concluded by moving a resolutionaffirming that the Secretary of State for the Home Department should be empowered to substitute, in certain cases a proportionate number of hours of work, instead of fixed periods of imprisonment and transportation. This and other propositions embodying Mr. Pearson's views were unanimously adopted, and a committee appointed to take measures for subjecting them to the test of experiment. A vote of thanks to the Lord Mayor ultimately brought these protracted deliberations to a close.
" JANR BYRB" AND CHABLOrTE .BRO&.E. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir, -In a recent number of The Times prominent notice was taken of the Life of Charlotte Bront, authoress of Janc Eyre, and the charges brought against the Cowen-bridge School and its founder, the Rev. W. Carus Wilson, were adopted and commented upon in your article as if they were true. The same sense of justice and indignation against wrong which prompted your severe remarks on the supposed cruel. ties of the Cowen-bridge School wil), I trust, engage you to give equal publicity to the following statements on the other sidle. I am wiling to hope that neither Charlotte Bronte herself nor her biographer had any intention of injuring either the Clergy Daughters' School or Mr. Carus Wilson. It is, indeed, didficult to believe that these writers could beguilty of so wanton an attack upon pablic benevolence and private character; but the injury is not the less real because it was undesigned, and it is only bare justice to this exoellent institution and its benevolent founder that the false impressions created by these books should be counteracted by a contradiction as widely disseminated, if possible, as the calumnies themselves. The charges made against the school and Mr. Carus Wilson, either directly by name or by implication with the Lowood establishment in Jane Rre, are chiefly these .- That the pupils were half-starved, the food provided for them being a and insufficient; that they were treated with habitual neglect and want of feeling; that the low fever which broke out among them was caused principally by bad food, and aggmvated by the cruelty of those at the head of the establishment; that the two elder sisters of Charlotte Bronte sank under this treatment, and that Charlotte herself suffered her whole life long in health from it; that Mr. Carus Wilson's character was deformed by spiritual pride, want of tenderness5 and a long list of other unsightly excrescences. Now, Sir, in answer to all this, I am prepared to produce good evidence and proof that in the whole mass of the foregoing charges there is not one word of truth. ItaincompeUed y the force of testimony now in my possession to believe that the promulgator of such falsehoods has received her information from those whso were eitber ignorant of the real facts, or disposed, fromn wrong motives, to distort aud misrepresent them. The testimony I have myself been able to cohlect respecting events which happened more than 30 years ago is furnished by those who were inmates of the establishment before, during, and after the residence of the little Brontes within its walls. The account iven by Charlotte Bront6's biographer of the school and Mr. Carus Wilson is faU of inaecuracies as to minor details of fact, not of much moment in themselves, but sufficient to show that her sources of information were not to be relied on, Whether the little Bront6s were fit subjects for a school education is another question altogether. The two younger children, Charlotte and Emily, "enjoyed unifi,rmly good health" at Cowen-bridge ; but Mlaria and Elizabeth, the former of whom is represented as the principal victim of the Cowen-bridge cruelties ia the character of Helen Burns, were clearly not in a fit state of health to have been sent to any school at all. "' They vwere not strong when they came, having only just recovered from a complieation of measles and hoopingcough; indeed, I suspect they had scareely recovered," &c. These are Mrs. GaskeUl's own words; and she informs us, moreover. that their mother died of internal cancer. These two children died of consumption iuherenu in a disea.ed eonstitation, and who can wonder at such a result, with such a constitution, after reading Mmr. Gaskell's own des-ription of the potato diet of their own home; "the cold damD arising from the flag floors and passages" of Haworth-parsonage; the bleak moors, long winters, and bitter blasts of the rude climate, where, " often on autumnal or winter nights the four winds of Heaven seemed to meet and rage together, tearing round the house as if they were wild beasts striving to find an entranco " Let any reasonable man say whether Mrs. Gaskell has not herself here described disease and hardship enough in the comfortless and cheerless home of their infancy to aecount for the early death of these two poor children, without imputing blame to the Coweu-bridge authorities for neglect and cruelty. The testimony of an eye-witness that Charlotte and Emily " enjoyed uniformly good health" at the school is a sufficient refutation of Mrs. Gaskell's statement that Charlotte " saffered her whole life long in heart and health from the consequence of what happened there." lt may, Sir, answer the purpose of novel writers and book makers to write pathetio descriptions of scenes of suf. fering and pungent satires on personal character; but, if truth is disregarded and charity forgotten, let them remember that " as a mad mau who casteth firebrands, arrows and death, so is the m%n that deceiveth his neighbour ana saith, Am not I in sport ?" As regards the diet at Cowenbridge, it would be too much to expect that either in a pubhcinstitution, or even a private family, there should niever be an instance of food being burnt or badly cooked. But here again I have the testimony of an eye-witness that "in this respect the institution in question compares very favourably with other and more expensive schools," But, Sir, there is another asoeet of the afflir. It is not only the actors and interests of 30 years ago that are touched by Mrs. Gaskell's book. The institition began at Cowen-bridge hai been carried on since 1833 at Cascerton, and. to borrow the words of a Preston paper, "the vile attack made on the rev. gentle. rman (Mr. Cams Wilson) has reference to the Clergy Daughters' Schooils; and, in consequence of what is said on the subject in the Bront6 memoirs, some ignorant revie*vers of the pablic press in London have arrived at the conclusion that at Cowen-bridge, or Castertom, "there exists," as observes the editor of thu Lanwcaster Gazete, " a sort of Dotieboys' hal. In this neighbourhood the interesting establishments alluded to are well known, and we can only sile at the verdancy of ou,r London contemporaries," &c. ow, Sir, in the visitors' boonk of thn Castsrton school there app ears the name of " Mrs. Ga6kell" as havng visited the institution in Mtarch, 1856 She was eJhown over the whulevhse, sa.w the pupils, and expressed nothing but satin. faetiosr~~~~~~~~~~~~~ats W Wo&l it not have been, then, an act of bare justice, as well as an ingenuotus and graceful acknowledgment, on her part, toWhave inserted in hei memoir a frargi; avowal that zVh*tever may have been the merits or demlaerits of the .lowen-btidge Pchool of 1824, the Cawterton School of 185; ;r,e"ented before her own eyes a gpeotacle of health and coma- (uin the p4pils4 and a result of generous large-hearted senevoleuee ia the foandei, sach as iijight well bring upe, is, not czalumny anud vituperaton, hut blessing: and gratitidt 8uch *b; avowval is indispensably required au Mrs. Gaa sell' pert, U che desires to relieve herself from te charge of coytlt,*Jjeh 1 dn noe cljusse to characterize. -- Elier own mind evidently hasa 'e misgivin5s as to thetruth of t45 aleged fasts eren of, Xsn* bridge story. Sho in effect admits that Chartlotte Bront6's own recolection of the facts was indistinct, falsified and exaggerated by h own vivid imagination. Let any cardid person read the following extract from the Bront6 memoir, and say whether it does not virtually surrender Mrs. Gaskell's wholo case "I believe she herself (Charlotte Bront6) would have been glad of an opportunity to correct the over-strong im. pression whic lwas made upon the lublic b ber vivid iciture, though even she, suffering her whoTe life long, oth inheart and body, fromrthe consequences of what happened there, might have been apt to the last to take ber deep belef in factsfor the facts tbemselves; her conception of truth for the absoluite truth." (P. 64.) In plain English, Charlotte Bront6's own account of Cowen-bridge is not to be trusted; and, indeed, how should it be so? She wrote, after the lapse ot 20 years, of what came under her notice at eight or nine years of age, and, besides the misty dimness of recollections so distant who does not know the microscopic effect upon the mind of a child, by which molehills are magnified into mountains, men into giants, and trifles into serious troubles? And yet, Sir, upon such dreamy recolections and selfcondemned fictions Charlotte BronteOs biographer has ven. tured to hold up to publio execration an admirable instituttion, and to vilify a great and good man, whose whole life, now verging towards three score years and ten, has been one continuous refutation of such slanders, by the singleiniuded and self-denying devotedness, remarkable even in these days of active henevolence, with which he has lived for one sole object-the good of his feUow-creatures! The Clergy Daughters' School is a public institution, open to public inspection; ani all who desire to know the truth are invited, as the best possible test, to visit the school itself; their horrors of starvation will be pleasantly dissipated by a burst of merriment from 100 round and rosycheeked girls, and their better feelings, I trust, raised in thankfulness to Him " from whom all good counsels and all 'ust works do proceed," while they gaze upon the fruits of Mr. Carus Wilson!s faithful labours, and hear of the love and veneration felt for one whose name will be remembered with gratitude by children's children, long after his calnmniators are forgotten. As regards the fever which broke out in the school, I have evidence that it existed, in the village at the same time, and may, therefore, very probably have been cornmutnicated to the school by infection; at any rate, the fact destroys Mr Gaskell's assumption that it was caused by the bad food of the institution. And the same witness, an inmate of the school during the fever, and one who remembers tho little Brontes there, can testify that, so far from the fever being " aggravated by the creelty" of the managers, every possible care was taken of the invalids; wine and everything else recommended by the medical attendant, were HberaMly supplied, and not one child wasattacked who did not recover. The only "cruelty" connected with the event is the cruelty of imputing unfeeling conduct to those who were doing their best to alleviate a Providential visita. tion, and who were spending and being spent in a great ard benevolent and arduous undertaking for the good of others. Itv will not do, Sir, for bookmakers to seize upon the characetrs of public institutions or private persons as so much literary capital ' To point a moral or adorn a tale." The claim of character to be respected is a sacred right; and the disregard of it (to use your own forcible words) is " a species of criminality which is shamefully neglected in the statutes of the realm." Mr. Carus Wilson, indeed, can well afford a sBnile of pity fer his assailants, and will, I am sure, desire no other revenge upon them than to return them good for evil and blesing fdr railing. It would occupy too much of your space to answer all Mrs. Gaskell's opprobrious remarks in detail, tbongh I have the means of disprovimg, point by point, more than one of her alleged facts; but will conclude these observations with an extract from a letter lately received from a former pupil of Cowen-bridge, as a testimony to the general character both of Mr. Wflson and the school:- "On leaving school I ;as questioned on the subject by friends, one of whom has lately said that my testimony at that time was, what it is now, that 'the bread, milk, meat vegetables, &c., were of the best iuality and that w, always bad as much as we w,ished for. While at school I do not think I ever heard any complaints about the diet among the girls. I must say that nothing could exceed the care and kindness which watched over us; the wants of each individual child were attended to ; the sliahtest ailment or itdisposition was brought under the particilar notice of the I superintendent, nnd was sure to receive every attention. While I was at Cowen-bridge no sick child could have been t'eated as Maria Bronte is said to been by a teacher, &c. They (the teachers) were, as a body, animated by a high sense of responsibilty, joined to a feeling of affactionate interest in the girls, generally speaking. 'I cannot express the indignation with which I have read the character of Mr.Wilson, as described by Mr Gaskell. It is very plain that she never knew him, or she never could have spoken of him in such terms. I Oh, no; I never saw in Mr. Wilson 's piritual pride,' | 'love of power,' or 'w ant of tenderness in his treatment of ns. He never wounded our feelings by any allusion to our dependent position; this is altogether a false representation of his conduct towards us. . . . . . It would be a great comfort to me if I could do anything to clear the school and its generous founder of the calumnies published against them by one who never knew either." The writer of this letter allows me to publish her name if necesary. She is one whose name would add weight to her testimony, and whose worth would be attested by high and I noble witnesses. I could add abundance more of extracts, did space permit; but I hope enough has been said to throw light upon the real nature of the case The public will form their own opinion both of Mr. Wilson and his assailants.

Thm LivERpooL COTTO-NMARtET.-The sales of cotton for the week, as made up on Thursday evenihg, amount to 34,820 bales, of which speculators have taken 1,950, exporters 4,450, and spinners28,420 bales. The business, it will be perceived, has only been on a moderate scale, and the chief characteristic of the market has been dulness ; but prices show considerable firmness, the mnore currant descriptions of American being without change. The import in the current week has been the largest on record, and reaches 213,485 bales, of which 186,785 are American; thelargest week previously was that ending March 1, 1855, when the import aunounted to 196,422 bales. This large import has not yet had time to produce its effect upon the market either one way or the other, its character as yet being scarcely changed from cotton afloat. Next week, when It is pretty generally sampled, its influence will no doubt be tested. Heretofore it has generally been found that when large imports have taken place from their accumulation at sea, owing to easterly winds, as in the present week, buyers, having delayed their purchases for the occasion, have entered the market in force and thus sustained it; but with the general feeling now prevdlent among spinners for restricting the hours of labonr, and by this means diminish their consumption of cotton, it is not expected that they wiU exhibit any desire to stock themselves with the raw material, and strength to the market, if it retain it, will come from other sources. Notwithstanding this excessive import, which has so greatly added to our stock it is now only on a par with last year, as shown in the table below. The following are the comparative prices of the three descriptions of American fair cotton, as quoted yesterday and at the corresponding period of last year, with the imports and estimated stocks of aU descriptions:- 1857. 1856.

I TO THE BDITOI OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Tho publication in your columns of much pertinent correspondence on the preservation of fish and the existing laws theieon leads me to draw your attention to a part of this subject worthy, perhaps, the observation of some of our lawgivers. My views are based on many yeals' investigation of the growth of our fresh-water fish. The artificial nurseries of them are already of some date (in my own case of more than six years' duration), yet, from their very want of success and repeated disasters, a conclusion might be drawn that the foremost principle in any new legislative enactment on this subject ought to be a greater care of the young fish. Arrest the hand of their captors, from the urobin with his crooked pin up to those employed by the great fishing companies, with their hundreds of device3 of cruives and stake-nets. The human enemies of the salmo7wnid yearly incase in numbers. The ingenuity of man's destructiveness outstrips eventheirmarvellous powers of reproduction. The income derived from their saleproves that they are a considerable source of food in these islands; and yet each egg has to be deposited on the exposed and shallow gravel bed of some small tributary stream, az near the fountain-head as the parent fish can ascend. The fry are attacked by foes whose name is Legion. The smolt runs a severe gauntlet of danger in his perilous path to the sea; if he escape it, to prove his value by a sudden return as a grilse of size and pretension, an object of capture to all. It is, then, for the grilse that greater exemption from this capture is required. Let the cruives and stake-nets be opened for longer periods, and made of larger mneshes during their summer immigration from the sea, and the reward will be a rapid increase in the real salmon, of firmer fibre and more proper food, as well as of greater money value as a mrketable article. It minght be Quixotic to suggest, as an analogy, that, if mutton become scarce, no lamb should graoe the tables of the rich; or that, if the oontagious typhus decimate the horned cattle of England, veal should be a forbidden meat; if the porcine race were suddenly diseased (from fear of the admission of the Jews into Parliament, or any other unlmown cause), no suacldng be sacrificed to the epicure. Yet it might seem reasonable to many, and, if such a theory could apply to these well-known domesticated animals, it must have treblo force in reference to the mysterious inhabitants of the rivers of waters. Let any one read the statistics published of late in an eminent Review, and he vill find how lamentable is the diminution of the full-grown fish taken on our coasts, and yet no legislation has special regard for their stages of growth I The proprietors, also, of the nursing rivers would be content with a fair unrestricted return of the grilse; and the now impatient angler, whose rate of destruction is always much over-rated, be satisfied. When we add to their claims in behalf of "youth and innocence" the knowledge that fully three years are requiste for the per fectly developed state of fish, it seems almost culpable to overlook so equitable a point in any projected alteration of our fisheries laws. Your obedient servant.
