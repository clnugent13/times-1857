Stretton fair, the train being due in about 20 minutes. -The porter, whose duty it was to keep the line clear, passed along the platform, arging the people to stand hack, as an expre6s train from Shrewssbury, already overdue, wouid pass through the staton without shtppin EIe then went on to attend Ito the points. The tic et-office being on the other side of the rails, a young woman named Bright crossed over just as the express came in view, about 60 syrdsof Thewhistlc was sounded, hut, notwithstanding fth, the young womaux mother, who was very old and quite deaf, attempted tofollow her, when the train, which wAx going at the rate oft 25 illesan hour omewhat slower than u al), Was Only, about SO yards off.

'The puram for money to c'ary forward peOCulalive operations continuea to check the otherwise ifavourable tendency of the fulda, and they have closed to-day at a further alight reaction, the effect ,of the prevailing demand being not merely to cause 'emporary inconveniene, but to indicate that any e.iQ3 that may occur is sure to be naet by numerous 'Iealizations. ConsoeI for money, which were quoted iTast evening 93i to 94, opened at 93i to J, ancd re 'urned to that price after a short period during 'which there was a alight tendency to iUprovement. 3For the 4th of June there were at one time buyers *t 949, but the last transactiona were at 94i to i. ]During the morning 74 per cent. was freely paid for iloana on'Goverunent seCurities.

The wants of the Stock-Exchange again exerted Msn influence on the discount-market to-day, and in -the earlier hours cf business money w7as actively sought in all quartem. . Subsequently it appeared 'that a full, if net an over supply had been obtained, -3nd in the afternoon there was a considerable diminu'tion in the demand. Foreign securitiea have not presented any imTortant alteration, and symptoms of heaviness were -a pparent to the clowe. Turldsh Six per Cents., for the account, were negotiated at and ; and 'the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account, at 101k.

The final quotationa of the French Thr per Clents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were e39f. 30c. for money and 69f. 40c. for the end of the maonth, 8howing a decline of an eighth. The railway meetings of the week have not been ,of importance. The report of the Monmouth ComTpany shows a profit which will allow the declaration of a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent., leaving a alaace ofw,9421. to be carried forward. Thereserve fund now amounts to 6,5001. A careful exnamlnation of the sbare and loan accounts has beea anade, and they have been found correct. According to the report of the Portsmouth Railway the progrems of the works is satidaeto. When the 133,0001. debentures shal have been issued the cornpany will be in a more favourable position. The inhabitants of Dover have passed resolutions in sup -port of the propossed extension line from Strood -to St. Mary Cray, which will increase the business ,on the route, and restore a large traffic to Dover. The report of the Sambre and Meuse Railway has been presented, but the contents are not considered -encouraging. A committee has been appointed with -the consent of the directors to ascertain if any improvement can be effected in the condition of the 'undertaking. At the West Flanders meeting a dividend of 3s. 6d. per share for the half-year was ~approved ; and the traffic shows a steady increase. The Belgian Government contemplate a revision of the laws and regulations bearing on the importation of foreign goods inLto Belgium. The object is to .assimilate their system as nearly as possible to that now in operation in this country, under the Customs Consolidation Act. Towards this end the 'Belgian Minister of Commerce lately made applica4ion to the English Government for such information as could be consistently supplied, and the matter -was referred to the Commissioners of Customs, who have shown every anxiety to afford assistance. An -official in the Customs was specialy appointed to prepare and fill up the various books and documents in use here, and to report upon the general practice. 'This has been done with care, the manner in which goods are dealt with being fully explained. The advantages accruing from the warehousing system 'in this country will, it is said, be fully understood 'from the explanations given, and cannotfailto excite -the attention of the Belgian Government. By the introcuction into Belgium of the bonding system in sll its inteority extraordinarv benefit will be conferred on the commerce of that country, and it in a .change which may be completely carried out with-out clashing with the views of any political party. The manner in which goods in transit are treated has 'lso been fully explained. The South-E3stern Railway Company are about -to carry out, or rather extend the " through registering system" for baggage to Brusels, Cologne, and -other places in Germany, vi0 Dover and Calais. For this purpose trains will be put on so as to arrive in London at 7.30 a.m., and 10.10 p.m. every day, -snd, as the system of examining passengers' baggage *at London-bridge, instead of Fol-estone, has given nmuch satisfaction, the directors have applied to the ,Commissioners of Customs to have the privilege extended to the passengers arriving from Belgium and Germany vid Dover. Some trifling additional expense will be incurred, but it is understood that the Board are now desirous of affording every facility to 'he public, and therefore no doubt is entertained of their reeommending the Treasury to accede to the sreqrest. The silk-market rermains in a state of suspense. rFrom Naples the accounts of the progress of the Ctop are good. In Lombardy there seenis still to be .much uncertainty. From France nothing unfavourable has as yet transpired. The Paris letters mention that M. Mires has appealed against the decision of the Tribunal of Cornmerce regarding the mode in which he allotted the 'shares of the Roman railways. According to the representations of the friends of M. Mires the ques-tion is whether a contractor, having undertaken heavy responsibilities on his own risk, has the right to select his associates from the crowd of applicants, -or is bound to allot shares indiscriminately to all 4subscribers who have lodged the required deposit. -As the case is understood on this side, however, the joint is simply whether M. Mires acted up to the implied conditions of hisownadvertisement. Re is alleged, after having invited applications on certain terms, to have changed those terms not only as regards the mode of distribution, but the date of issue. A contractor is, undoubtedly, entitled to miake any stipulations he may deem desirable in his -original notice, but as soon as that notice is put forth an honourable agreement must be considered to exist between biinself and the public, which cannot in any degree be departed from. The Aliquis has arrived from Foochowfoo, and is believed to have brought a considerable quantity of .4ea. The steamer Atrato for the NVest Indies will take ,out only 6,0001., of which 1,0001. is silver. It is stated that the Euxine steamer, with the India and China mails, arrived at Marseilles this morning at 11 a.m.; the bags were to leave for London at I0 p.m., and may be expected at mid,day (n Monday. The annexed information relative to the progress -of Englibh mining adventure is condensed from the Minhi,g JToual:- " The market bas t9ken a decided turn for the better ;as regards the extent of general buBiness transacted and the more confident feeling exhibited. Some descriptions of sbares have fluctuated a goed deal, with a downward teldency, but in others a good demand has been maintained, with advanced prices. At Devon Great Consols meeting tho accounts shoved a balance in favour of adventurors' o -of 2!. per share was declared, and 1,7106. carried to credit eof next account.

In rome caes the ga obliged to submit to lower rates~, and, thedeiand faUag considerably sbort of the ducio, the increase of stocks in maost fabrics is wevoning the tore of the market, The demand for domestice ha bEen limitea, and, -excekt for one or two kinds, lower rates have had to be taken, without being able to effect "s of any consideration. 1sngooths and T-eloths are affected in the same way, and are eyually dificult to move. Thb aale of printing cloths and 36-mch and 40-inch shirtings also eon. tinue on a small ale, at rather lower rates, Not only is this compelling manufacturers to combine for self.protectiou by lessning their production, but the pressur Is so grot in some quarters that 'they are going upon short time or closing their establishments without waiting -for the co-operation of others The' cloth-market is therae fore altogetber in a most nantisfactory position.

A ittle Inquiry has been noted in 2cis too 30Is mule ,nforIra, and the previeus eng agments made for these a numbs cause theo n to hold aboup rhefumeot plae in the BIRMIINGHAM, MsY 16.

Th,Me reduction of 3lu per ewt In the pnrice of commorn and 4s. per cwt. in refined' bloots has hada favourable in. fluenco upon the manufacture of tin wares, but not to the extent which bas been represented. This- branch ofl loa business has for some weeks pest been7 busy, moit of the large estblishments baving sulldcient orders on hand to keep their workpcople well employed; and tho.e redu*on has not as yet materially added an increse of make. The ironfoundries of the districb are doing a moderate amount of work, the edged' tool mnufacture being particularly active The Tarious casting businesses of the neighbourbood are brisker, and at Weetbromwich the hollow. ware trade is represented to be much better than duing the eary prtof heyear; Thelato faU in -thopriceof copper has not caused the active demand among the maunfacturers of copper ari"cles -which the sielts antlicpated, but inthe oour of a few weeks, as onfidence in present rates becomes more eeta. blushed, a better demand may be looked for. Some of the pzincipal founders expect a further reduction, but many fims would prefer the steady maiutenanoe of present rtes. Fluctuations and uncertainty we sid to produce injirions effects upon the anannufcturn. trades as great a those caused by unreasonLably highf prioeL The bra and copper wire and brnm locomotive tube trades e far from active, but bras cabinet work Is generally good. In the birding gun and pistol manafacture little has been doing in the early part of the ye, but therAde I im. proving. There hae been few Government oontract on hand for musket9, but within these few days for carbines good ordecs have been rk. , ye by some of the old ci oojtrcors for The factors represent the country trade a somewhat dull but it is improving as the snummer advances. The drders received from commercial men are numerous, but they are not heavy in amount. For husbandry implements there is a fair demnd; and in heavy seed toya there is a good deal doing. This is attributed to a slight stir in the bulding trade, as compared with the corresponding period of last year. At Siourbridge and the nelihbourhood thb cailn manufaature continues to be aotive, and at ledditch- the needle. makers ae more than usnally busy. The foreign trade in articles of Birmlng8am manufactm is extremely buoyant. From South AnericA and the S s West India Islands merobants are in poession of good orders, and continental comm-isions are represented to be on the increase. From the British colonies in the West Indies and other colonies there is a good demand for general ironmongery and for planters' and edged tools, which will, as usual, no doubt greatly improve as the saon advances NORWICII, MAY 16. The manufaturing trade here has been rather dull, but it is expected that the execution of the autumn orders wi1l cause an imp.ovement in a few days. A good continuous trade has been doing in poplins. The shoe busines con, tinueo active, and almost ever* establishment is placardied wih announcements stating that more wrorkmen are re.| quiredisn the various branches of the craft. The abundance of employment produced by this department of the national industrny ho cused a sensible decrease of lato in thoel pau perism of the cityo LEFDS, WAY 16.

The staple trade of this district is still inactive. In worsted pieces there is in th agregate a larger amonnt of businessitraesantingthanfor some weeks pastw There has been a good attendance of merchants in the marketr, and, althodgh their operations are made with catlyon, as the seasonablo chae in the wether is favourable to trade nore numerous transactiosn are reported, and on th thole ousinehs is more satifactory. There Is, howtever, a airge proporton both of spfnning and weaving machinery out of use, and the o;cerative cLase necessarily suffer from the general inactivitaye Dulness is the prevailing tnen of the yarn department. or elportthe inquit is nactivo, and in this, aS inthe home branch the spinnes comptinthat their business has not been se slack for somey6arspaet; byvers hare refained from mtaing purchaes, being actuated by an impression that eventuol'y the prices of the rawe materil will fll, and thus enable them te parchase with more freedom and at easier rate. The current rates for cotten warps are generally without alteration, butdoubled yarns are rather easier 'The wiool market is without any changc north of note TheCdeslingsinrombingpdoscriptions are restrictd, as has been the case for some time, to the poitive requiremens of e trade, and, in the opertions that have been entered into' the priees lateli current have been suoported writh a rmness hardly anutiopated.

Lnm-The country markets have all been sparingly sup p led with brown linens, but, owinlg to purchasers buying witw great cauaton, prices tend downwards. linen yarn u -he fine dry weather has so occupied the farmers with field operations that very little flx has been brougt forward, any that did appear being ea gerly bought up at an CorroN.-The rate of yarns continules firm. Lastwerek's reportsof the saleof high counts of twist are tolerable. There IS Nttle to note in the market for goods. Belfast houses are not so heavy in stock as they w ere some time ago. GBoods in the meantime come in very sparingly fromu the country, and It iS probable that production will keep low for the next two weeks, at least until the close of spring, labour in the rural districts.

LOHDOZY CHUBWHZS AND OLANDBSTIZUY EABIMAGE& TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-When your old subscriber and correspondent "PaterfamiliasP was in his accustomed plate at his parish chnrch last Sunday morning, he heard, as he always expects to hear, immediately after the second lesson, a formula road, in the mniddle of which a list of names, longer or shorter, as the case may have been, was introduced. To all this he paid no manner of attention, nor, so far as he is aware, did anyone else in the congregation. The clergyma rea it hurriedly through, somewhat with the air of a an asbamed of what he was-doing; and the organ almoat drowned the concluding words of the first notes of the Tuobilae chant. On the following ornoing " Paterfamiliae' was as usual in the city; and on the south side of St. Paurs-churchyaud he passed, for the thousandth time, the corner of a narrow street, where one or two men in white aprons were loung. ing. Afew yards further westward anotherwhite-aproned idler was standing under an archway; but our friend took: co notice of either this man or his fellows. They werer always there; they had never accosted him except once,. when he was in mourning, and happened to have a packet of papers in his hand. He remembers, indeed, having once turned down " Pauls Chan," and having felt ratherfoolisl as he did so; but that was years ago, when he was a muds younger man. Last autumn his daughters persuaded him to take tihen into Scotland; andperhapsherecollects, as the train crossed "the Border," an inward feeling of satisfaction which he experienced as he reflected that a certain blacksmith's shop -or inn-parlour it may have been-in those parts had no longer tho terrors which once it possessed for respactable heads of families. Gretna-green, ho fclt, was Gretna. green no longer, save only in name. Simple-minded man t Now, Sir, "Paterfamiliss' may have no fears on his own account. We aze all well acquainted-thanks to one admirable pencil-with the bright faces which welcome bim home every evening; and we are sure that those fair girls will nover havo a secret from their parents, or give them cause for one moment's uneasiness. But allhomes aze not so happy as his. Your own advertising columns, Sir, have told from time to time of very dif ferent household experiences; and overy London clergyma% knows that beneath the system represented by that paren. thetical interruption to the liturgy on the one hand, and by t1os3owhite-aproned loungers of St. Paurs-churchyard on the other, there lurks a mischief compared with which ths facilities for border marriages were scarcely worth a moment's thought. We might as well, Sir, expect to put a, stop to intemperance in England by withdrawing the lioensa of an alehouse in somo Cornish or Northumbrian villag, as imagine that clandestine marriages can be effectualljr checlked by anti-Gretna-green legislation so long as the prezent prActice remains in force in London churches and in Doctors'-commons. I address you, Sir, as a London clergyman who finds hir. "elf totally unable to cope with an evil by which he is Shoclked and scandalized. I cannot &Ak-you -to afford me enough of your most valuable space to enter into the detaila upon which my conclusions have been based; but if the atbject is one, as I cannot but believe, deserving of p#sblit attention, I trust that wou will notrefuse this letter a placm in iour columms. Iam prepared to show, if yesr, tyhat while opr pre. sent eclesiastical system of MArige atter banns or by license may work well in the raral distiics, yet in Londei. certainly, and I belielve in a&U our great towns it affords n% security whatever against oandestine or irregular mrliages. I believe that English fLthers of familes are not sufiB ciently aware of the prtl workdng of this system, and it is in order to bring this subjedt suder their notioe that I venture to ask you teisIsert my letter in ajournal which is lead wherever Englishmen are found. The remedy, it nrmedy is needed, ls in their haids, and no words of Mine can be ecesary tehwrge tkem to gurd the peace and oDmfort of their own hones. L StiUlas a clergyman, Imaybeallowedto ntermYprotest against the leager eontinuance of an outgrown system, tha effect of which is that I myself or any one of loy brethreax in the metropolis ma6y at anytime be made the ignor0at and involntary, instrumentof destroyng the happines of as family, profanng a* service of the church, anA provoking the unworthy taunt, which would fnd, I fear, in anmy quarters too ready an echo,that the clergy, bishops includd care for nothijsng Ouch as a fte. e. ucfl &-LONDO .X ZICFUMBBXT, W 1Q

LONDON, MONDAY, MAY 18, 1857. The Treaty of Peace with Persia hag) as we learn from Teheran, beenratified, and is already j well on its 'way to this country; but, before we have done with war, we may as well colleab from the details just published of the Persian Campaign two pieces of very instructive informa. tion. The first illustrates the importa3ice in Oriental warfare of that confident and unhesitahing' spirit which takes no account of odds or difficulties in improving an advantage or pursuing a success. Skilful arrangements comabined with intrepid conduct soon placed Mohammerah in the possession of the British; but this' achievement, though extremely creditable in itself, does not represent the most striking feature of the expedition. The distinctive character of General OuTRAa?s campaign is to be sought rather in the extraordinary boldness and promptitude by which the victory was improved, and the accumulation of results which a single success was thus made toproduce. No sooner had the Persian army retired from its intrenchments at MIohammerah, and commenced its retreat into the interior, than Sir JAMFs despatched a force on its track, although it was perfectly clear that the original strength of the enemy had been very considerable and that his loss had been comparatively trifling, while to crown the difficulties of the crisis the British cavalry had not been able to complete its landing, and a Bingle troop of horse only was available for the contemplated service. Nevertheless, even under such circumstances as these, Sir JAE3 dd not hesitate for a moment, but gave orders to Captain M3arcors G Bx= to follow up 13,000 Persians with only 45 troopers-a duty which that officer very effectualy discharged. Upon the receipt of his report and upon the intelligence subsequently brought in the British Commander at once resolved to take advantage of the enemy's dismay, and in the course of eight-and-forty hours he detached a flying column of some 300 men to overtake the Persians, and do whatever might be practicable in completing their rout. The result was that this little force, on penetrating to Ahwaz, a towIl some distance up the river, not only came up with the whole Persian army in a new position, but actually succeeded in dislodging it and putting it a second time to flight, and a new victory, almost as important, and even les costly than that at Mohammerah, was gained solely upon the credit of the original success. But for this dashing exploit the enemy might have recovered his confidence at Ahwaz, collected his forcem anew, 'and moved down, perhaps, upon Mohammerah, to fight the last battle over again. As it is, not only has the fortified position been carried, but the entire army of the Persians, under the immediate command of the SnAinZADEH, or heir apparent, in person, has been driven in a state of terror and disorganization league after league before a mere handful of our troops, and-what is more-the whole population of the country has witnessed and appreciated the spectacle. Such a system of tactics, evincing as it does a thorough knowledge of Oriental character, wiRl remind some of our readers of the campaigns of AIEA2mLn, who thousands of years ago employed the same audacity against the same enemy with the same completeness of success. It is not every General, however, who would venture on making 45 troopers do duty for the cavalry of an army, or who would send 300 men in pursuit of 13,000. Numbers, it is true, count in reality for little under such conditions, and the event hai shown as much, but it requires a commander of no ordinary merit to act unshrinkingly on the conviction. The next lesson we may draw from the despatches before us ia suggested by the comparative ineffliolency of the Persian troops when opposed to the British, notwithstanding the singular excellence of their preparations and the science which had apparently been placed at their command. From the description given by Sir JAmrs OuTnAr of the works at Mohammerah it appears as if the best engineers inEurope could not have planned defences more cleverly, constructed them more solidly, or armed them more formidably, than had been here done by the officers of the Sn. "Batteries had "been erected of great strength of solid earth, 20 "feet thick, 18 feet high, with easemated "embrasures. * * These, with other "earthworks, armed with heavy ordnance, com"manded the entire passage of the river, and were "so skilfuly and judiciously placed and so scien"tifically formed as to sweep the whole stream to "the extent of the range of the guns up and down "the river and across the opposite shore; indeed, "everything that science could suggest and labour "accomplish in the time appeared to have been "done by the enemy to effectuaUy prevent any "vessel passing up the river above their position." This description might Eerve for Sebastopol itself, and it may perhaps be in the reader's recollection that similar praise was bestowed upon the forts found to have been constructed by the Chinese. Both Chinese and Persians, too, we are expressly told, stand to their guns with considerable intrepidity, and yet in both cases the balanee of advantages in actual conflict appears almost as completely on the side of the British as it might have been a century ago. For that matter, indeed, the Chinese are thought to have anticipated Europeans in the disovery of gunpowder, and should therefore be the most experienced, if not the most skilful, artillerists in the world. Nevertheless, neither intrenchments, which sometimes inspire even disorderly troops with fortitude, neither ample earthworks nor solid masonry, neither shot, shell, rifle, nor cannon, can raise Asiatics to the level of Europeans, nor does there appear, indeed, much difference of character between the days of CLivE and the days of OurRAs-between the Battle of Plasy and the Battle of Khooshab. The moral we draw from these facts is, that it takes something more than equipment to make a soldier. The superiority of one army to another does not depend upon new rifles, conical bullets, or well-made field guns. It cannot be decisively affected even by those arts of fortification which are especially designed to augment the strength of the weak. Perhaps, indeed, we may be disposed to conjecture that the defences of MIobammerah were planned and constructed by European assistance, and that if the Persianz had really been themselves the architects of such works, like tha Romans and the Swedes, they would also, like the Romans and the Swedes, have known how to maintain them. We collet, also, from the detail given of the captured artillery, which would naturally include all the heaviest pieces, that the Persian ordnance must have been very inferior to tho guns of our' steamers in weight aiid calibre. 1 But, after aUl these allowances have been made, there remains stil unimpeachable proof that the weapon cannot make the man, and that it need not be apprehended, even after all the discoveries now announced, that the difference between superior and inferior troops is likely to disappear. When we read of such battles as those between ConTmZ and the Mlexica s we are naturally apt to attribute the result to European arms; but it is plain that Europeans in the present day can encounter Asiatics with just as decisive success and just as little loss, although the Asiatics have howitzers and sharpshooters as well as theor adversaries. The Persians have artillery and ammninition, riflemen and mortar batteries; at a review they could probably make very good practice, and Sir Husxv RA-WIm-soN has assured us that at bottom they are really a patient and courageous people. Something, however, beyond all this is evidently wanting to make first-rate troops, and that something m ust be looked for in the organization which gives to every branch of an army the infallible assurance of support from every other; in the thouxand appliances whichx genuinke civilization contributes, and, above all, inthe self-respect, self-coifidence, and resolution of character which education and intelligence impart to the individual soldier. The aspect of war may be changed by new inventions, but the relative value of armies will remain the same. No description of projectiles, however terrific, is likely to demolish the superiority of race over race or nation over nation. We may continue our experiments in musketry with every prospect of aug. menting onr own strength, but with very little danger of fabricating elements of power against ourselves.
To place any set of men, however depraved, ignorant, and dangerous, at the absolute disposal of the Executive seems certainly a strong measnre. Yet$ taking all the difficulties of the subject into consideration, we know not that any course is bitter than to leave the destinies of the criminal after conviction in the hands of the osin SZCRETAIY,subjecttothecontrolofParliameent. Thedegrees of crimecalledby the same legal name, the characters of criminals condemned for the same legal offenc. or to the same punishment for different offences, Dre so various; the years, the health, the education of the prisoners enter so much into any system of discipline, that we must be content to trust the authorities who are brought face to face with each individual offender. In this, at least, Iwe must recognize the principle of a paternal goverrment. As soon might we subject the management of schools or of private families to rigid, unchangeable regulations, prescribe the same lesson to every boy or the same diet to every invalid, as deny that the Government may rightly remit or modify punishment, hold out hopes, give opportunities of reform, and even the means of starting in a new career. Some philosophers there are, doubtless, who hold that penitence, even if it be sincere, is no ground for a remission of retribution. The evil act having been committed and the sentence passed, the public has nothing to do with any change in the prisoner's mind; his repentance he will have the benefit of, inasmuch as it will deter him from repeating the offence and subjecting himself to a second punishment; but there is, they arge, no ground for allowing this moral change to interfere with a sentence awarded for a material offence. However, we have to look at the subject practically. We find not only that there are many who fall into cnme through temptation, through ignorance, even through accident, but that in prison, in the hulks, in the penal colony, theypreserve theirhumaan natures, and cannot by any system of discipline be removed from the influences of hope and fear, and anger and despair. To the turnkey and the visiting magistrate they may be so many numbers belonging to so manywards, but they are to themselves still thinldng, feeling men, who, though ,laves of the lowest kind, still require something like discriminating government and moral influcnce. Hence practice has shown that it is at once most humane and most easy to rule them as men are ruled outside prison walls, by exciting among them the hope of release or of mitigated punishment. The details of the system, the prindiple of which seems admitted, mast necessarily be left to the Central Government. What is to be done with the depraved boy of 16, the vicious thieving girl, the clerk who has forged, the trader who has swindled, the sturdy burglar, or the aged receiver of stolen goods, must be the study of those 'who superintend the execution of their sentences. Each one of these offenders may be condemned by the Jadge to the same punishment, yet age, disposition, and capabilities all may vary; and the country which may benefit by the eventual liberation of one- may not be able with safety to release another. We consequently. cannot quarrel with the proposal to extend the discretion of Government in the treatment of criminals. The new system must, indeed, be closely watched; every case should be registered, every detail made public, Eecurity given that neither favour nor individual crotchets, nor an insufficient mode of testing the moral improvement of the prioners, shall affect the administration. But, within certain limits, it seems that the nation may without danger commit to its rulers the decision whether an offender shall be imprisoned in a county gaol or sent to work in the] Dockyards, or transported to Swan River, or set free at home, or assisted to emigrate to some place fixed by authority. But there is one point on which we think this liberty may fairly be limited. The ticket-of-leave system has been a perfect failure. The arguments of its apologists have converted no one, and can only satisfy those who have formed foregone conclusions. On the one side we have a few philanthropic disciplinarians; on the other, the entire public,-judges, magistrates, barristers, members of Parliament, householders, and all who are impaitial judges of the matter.- Mr. KTrsTINQs amendment on Friday night certainly seemed to express a feeling which has been all but universal for a long time past. The abolition of tickets of leave would, we doubt not, be merely a positive enactment of what will take place of itself without any enactment at all. It is impossible that a system which has been so widely and unsparingly condemned, and which even the convicts complain of as offering them only a seeming mercy, can hold its ground. In fact, whatever may be said, the country is well aware that the ticket-ofleave system is practically only a device for getting rid of criminals. Transportation has been difficult of late years; the world is being filled up, colonies are recalcitrant, we cannot send men of European race to Baffln's Bay in one extreme of climate or to Western Africa in another; we have bad to keep our criminals at home, where they have accumulated by thousands; new gaols have been built and filled and declared insufficient, ratepayers have become restiff, the authorities anxious, and so the ticket-of-leave has been made one of our institutions. The system carries with it its own condemnation, for it is plainly a deception. The convict is told that he is liable to have his leave reealled, and be again put to the crank for misconduct, or the suspicion of misconduct; but he knows well that this is only a pretence. The governor, the justices, the Ro0in SOECBXTAY are glad to get rid of him. He is so far pardoned; but still he is a marked man. His ticket-of-leave can only exercise- Jn injurious influence over-him.' His dependence on the Executive is not gufficient to deter him from evil courses, but it is sufficient to hinder him from the following of better ones. He is one of a condemned caste, registered among evilldoers, with his name and description in the hands of the watchful myrmidons of whom he stands in abject fear. He is the dreaIl of housekeepers, the scorn of working people, the game of the police. Eis steps are dogged wherever he goes, and he must be indeed a man of Etrong resolution if he can turn to hard labour and honest courses with the continual fear that some policeman or some stray spectator at the last aEsizes will denounce him as a felon under Govemment surveillance, and cause him to be thrust unceremoniously or violently out of doors. This is no imaginary picture. Every one acquainted with t'he subject, and especially the ticket-of-leave men themselves, declare that it is impossible to get a living with the ban of the Government upon them. If a prisoner by good behaviour shows hbiself deserving of a remission of punisbment ho may fairly receive a free pardon, with a wariSng that a second offence will be more severely dealt with by thQ infliction of penal servitude ; but to preseve theo resent mean betwepunlshmeut ana freedom Peems as indefensiblo in theory as it hase . unsuccessful in practice. I
Bishop BlRnmalY sat down to compose an emay upon the virtues of tar-water, the cod-liver oil of his day, and-wound up with a dissertation upon the TaTrY. Much in the same -spirit Lord 3MLEsBuIy'oa Friday night took in hand the Ornamental Water in St. James's Park. He adopted as a starting point the proposed expendi. ture upon this little lake-it amounts, we believe, to 1l,0001., more or les,-and proceeded to foretell a grand political crash in our institutionsx based upon the discontent of the taapayers at this profligate expenditure of the public money. The overburdened people have tolerated the repair of King zAnLEzs's statue at Charing-croes, although this put their patriotism to a shrewd trial; 3a&y, they have not yet organized any natinal system of opposition to the QuEEN' Government, although [the sum of 2,5001. has been wantonly lavished on the construction of those- two yellow brick walls which now disgust the provincial taxpayer as he saunters into St. James's Park by the Marlboroughouse entrance. But, once in the Park, what a spectacle meets his ullen and indignant gaze! IWhere once there wax water there is now no water at all. Tiue, the liquid was foul, stinking, and polluted,-it generated malaria, and was a nuisance to the neighlourhood; but then it cost nothing. True, many hundreds of children-many thousand*, we may almost say, without exaggerationi-may be seen every day tumbling about and disporting themselves upon the green sward that contained that abominable pool; but of what consequence is that to the indignant taxpayer 9 Whay sould he be called upon to contribute to the comfort and wellbeing of these urban nuralings? London is nothing to him, northe children of the Londoners either. He and his helpmate, Ru'r Wironoam, with the sixteen little WnoLasomsZ, all lawfully begotten, reside on the pleasant uplai of Devon, or by the side of Bala Lake, in Merionethshire; he will find freish air and watereresses for his interesting progeny; let the Londoners do the same by their pallid children-ay, and pay the bill themselves. What is it to him that some emasculated diletank-some daudy of the fine arts-would fain see the Metropolitan Parks put into such order that they may.be a delight to the people and a credit to the coumtry ? He cares nothing about such matters-either he nor his good fiMend Lord MA. Ezuiri. Something we had eard of a pleasant seat in EMpshire, by the Christ Church River-of a place which it would be an event in a Londokers life even to see; and of this seat, if we mistake not, Lord Ma}SBYsruny is the owner. We could have wished that the patriotic Peer, before going into such violent opposition upon a matter wbich is certainly very interesting to Londoners and to most persons who visit London, had provided himself with two bottles of transparent glas. ; we would have had him fill the one with the liqicid cryal amid -which the fish on his domain disport themselves ; the other shouid have been replenished with the seething filth from the Ornamental Water in St. James's PaTk while that commodity was yet a drug in tho market. Wit thewe two bottles upon his writing-table we would have had Lord AMUZSBurY sit down and eompose the speech which he delivered on Friday night to the Peers of England. Call you this opposition? Failing China, tby Chinese pheasants! !Failing Russia, try Muscovy ducks.. As the late Czar TicHoLAS and Mr. Cbonmissioner Ymr-that Mandarin of fourteen years' standing-have turned out but failures in the hands of those who sided with them to the intended confusion of English statesmen, Lord MAraMsBuRw has now descended to the poultry-yard, and would positively play upon our best feelings in favour of those interesting specimens of waterfowl which wvre wont to disport themselves in St. James's Park. Positively one of the buttresses of Lord 1mr.sBsUrS argument ran as follows :-" Their Lord"ships all knew that, however beautiful the piece "of Ornamental Water.in St. James's Park was, "its attraction was very much enhanced by the "waterfowl which lived upon it. If a collection "of waterfowl were in future to be maintained "there, the Department of Pablic Works would "have to employ people to feed them, now that "all the aquatic vegetation which grew on the "lake, and on which they mainly subsisted, had "been cleared away and prevented from again "accumulating." The forlorn creatures with speckled bills and hard Latin names will quack their blessings upon Lord MZASBnuny; they will remember him affectionately in those screeching orisons which they pour forth at sundown; they will acknowledge that their embonpoint is his work-the result of his special interference in their behalf before the British House of Peers. To deal, however, seriously with this nonsense, surelyit is a little hard when great Lords and great gentlemen, who have great parks and great country places, with full power of flying about from one beautiful corner of Europe to another yet more beautiful, stand between the Londoners-there are well-nigh 3,000,000 of us-and the improvement of our few patches of green sward. Could all these great people be made to understand the delight we Londoners take in our gardens, how pleased the little town-made children are to roll about among the smoky sheep and to court the terrors of the disappointed swan-how the old men, the aprici senes, who are wearing out their last days of life in this huge Babel, rejoice to saunter about and sun themselves in these green oases among the acres of brick and mortar,surely they would leave us in peace, and not try to vamp up a shred of political capital from the allocation of a small sum to put our gardens in order. Independently of this, there is great truth in the argument urged by Lord GnANVMLE, in reply to Lord MALTESBURY :-" Considering "that London was the capital of so large a king"dom, he believed that those who were not resi"dent in it woudd feel disgusted if it were left "in a neglected and unbecoming position." Lord G(Ravinr had previously established the fact that the Ornamental Water in St. Janes's Park was in a filthy and disgusting state, snd then went on to add, with great truth, that the Parks were the great feature in London which gave this metropolis a superiority over foreign eapitals. It is not with us as on the Continent, although we are improving; we have not the same architectural trophies massed together that you may find elsewhere. In Paris, Berlin, Vienna, the visitor might readily enough discover more imposing quarters than any he could find in London, but as far as our Parks are concerned we are -without rivals. The Bois de Boulogne at Paris, the Thiergarten at Berlin, the Prater at Vienna, lie respectively outside each of those towns. The London Parks are inT London. In reason an inhabitant of any other portion of these islands may fairly be cailled upon to contribute -the fraction of a farthing yearly as a contribution to the improvemeut of these beautiful gardons. When he himselI visits the metropolis with his family he will get t'ne benefit of his mite, and, if he should never do so, any money within reonable limits spent upon the. adornment of the metropolis may well be oonsidered as spent upon a national object. ThQ oonclusioni of Lord M1E1trasmsnvu spe%'k -that portion of it, .ii fact,'twhich aUg eetet compaion between this strange oratoical effort aud Bishop BIlnLEvs e.say-it ludicrous in the extrme. He began by maling out his cae against the propoeed expenditure on the Orn*mentsl Gardens in St; Jamem's lark;, he woulm up with twitting the Govement with having expended V6,000,000o . -on tie war. -What we about to expend 14,0001.-or, ray, only. 11,0001.-upon such an object, when"we had ia. creamed the public debt by 40,000,0001., when .V had a-permanent carge of 1,5oo§ool *ax A interest on the debt, when we had besides to pay' something like 2,000,0001. anuaUly to a sinkingfund for the purpcbe of extinguiialihi thb debtf HainDg thus exhausted his patriotic indignation and his dismal vein, the noble lord subsided into jocularity.

:ZXHIBITION OF THE BOYAL ACADEMY. (Fourth and concluding notice.) Mr. C. Lucy's picture of the " Burial of King 'Jharlea J." (16), one of the few historical works -n the Exhibition, is throughout creditable to the -painter both in conception and execution. We do mot know Mr. Lucy's authority for the incident of -he trooper laying his hand on the book out of which Juxon is about to read the burial service. The .4gures iu the foreground-one, we presume, the SDuke of Richmond, who followed his Royal master -to the grave-are particularly good, both in execu'tion and expression. Altogether this picture is an --sdvance on anything bIr. Lucy has yet pro 'duced. Amid the all but universal devotion of our best figure painters to genre, evcry creditable ..ffort at historical painting proper on the scale of this work demands recognition and encourageunent. Mfr. Philip is still faithful to Seville, and justifies his choice of subjects from a country where daily Wife is still picturesque by the power of his colouring -and the strong character of his heads. His " Prison Windovr, SeviUa, 1857" (225), reprcsents a Gipsy .mother, who is lifting up her child to the caress of its imprisoned father, while she hides her own tears -behind the little one, as if anxious not to darken the .momentary happiness of theprisoner. Her old mother meantime keeps the lounging sentry in talk, and .may be supposed to have bribed him wvith the cigar the is lighting into prolonging the time alowed for the interview between her daughter and the captive. ..Even more vigorous in texture and handling, Mr. 1r :Philip's second picture, " Charity" (448), shows us a beggar woman of Seville in her coarse manta, with a sleeping infant in her arms, in vain proffering her ,prayer for charity to a black and bloated "Don Basilio" of a frate, who with folded hands and obdurate face of Pharisaical self-complacency passes -on, deaf to her cravings. The worn face of the woman, with much remains of beauty, expresses at once hopelessness and entreaty. The picture is painted with a firm and sure hand, and is full of rich eobriety of colour. Altogether there is no painter -of our rising English school who promises to attain to higher rank as a colourist than Mr. Philip, and he has had the good sense to feel that colour employed on subjects which appeal neither so the brain nor the heart is half-wasted. Mr. Ansdell, in imication of Mr. Philip, has sought in Spain more picturesque fo-.ns of animAl life than Enigland can supply. His " Ploughing" (597) is a vigorous transcript of a group from the fat fields that border the Guadalquiver-a brown and spare Andalusian peasant foUowing his primitive plough, an implement to. make a British farmer's hair stand on end, drawn by two longbacked, sinewy, black and white oxen. All is hot and parching, lrom the baked clods of the fallow he is turning to the gray thistle-stalks and prickly pears nearer the river's bank. A hot blue sky, with scarce a fleck of white cloud, and in the distance the noble cathedral of SeviUe. In its arrangement the picture will remind those who have seen Rosa Barheur's Luxembourg picture of that fine work. But Mr. AnadeU has not attained that power of broad and masterly rendering of bovine form and coat, nor that intense grasp of common field landacape 'which lifts Rosa Bonheur's pictures into the ideal of their class. Mr. Anadelrs other pictures of "Mules Drinking" (356), and " The Water Carrier" (534), both bits of common wayside life at SeviUe, are faithful aud vigorous. The slow enjoyment with which the brown head and the gray head in the former suck up the water from the trough is thoroughly conveyed. The picture awakens a grateful sense of coolness and refreshment under a sultry sky. The "Water Carrier" has the same quality. In the crowded Academy rooms during this hot weather this is a precious recommendation. The shrewd humorous head of the old purveyor of aqtafresca, who is addressing a sly compliment to the girl waiting her turn at the fountain, shows that Mr. Ansdell has a feeling for human as well as animal expression. This picture may teach us, too, what a true Spanish borrico is, .how different from the subdued, stunted, suffering British donkey. The very generml opinion expressed that Mr. Ansdell has made a great spring in his art may serve as a hint to that large body of our painters who go on year after year repeating old subjects, how an eye may be quickened, and a hand invigorated by thei excitement of new sicenes. If Mr. nasdell has improved he has his change of models to thank for it. The exhibition is rich, as usual, in domestic or genre pictures. Among all these there is none that attracts more observant crowds than Mr. Solomon's " Waiting for a Verdict" (562). Hitherto known as a painter of pretty faces in attractive costumes, most at home in that Watteau-world of brocade and high-heeled shoes from which human cares and iorrows seem banished, Mr. Solomon has this year displayed a strength of expression and a power of pathetic story-telling altogether unsuspected in him. A peasant family including two generations, are waiting in the -corridor of an assize court for the verdict which is to decide the fate of the husband of the younger woman, the son of the older couple. The old father sBits with his head buried in his hand, bowed down with shame and exhausted with anxiety. His dog, -dimly sensible of the suffering about him, reds his -head sympathetically on the old man's thigh. The *old wife, with feminine fortitude, tries to bear up herself and to cheer the sad group around her, thouoh the tears are in her own honest eyes. She dandYes her unconscious grandchild, who crows and chuckles. The *wretched wife of the man whose fate trembles in the balance sits haggard and half wild with misery, with clinched hands and red eyes-she has flung off her bonnet and her hair has fallen about her face. An elder child lies asleep at her side. A Younger sister, behind, turns eagerly round, at sound of louder voices heard thrxough the door leading to the court, which has just been opened by a stolid bailiff to let out zone of the barristers, who may be supposed to be bringi news of the verdict. Painful as this subject is, the expressions are not forced nor melodLramatic. The story may be read 'Clearly in all parts of the picture. The painting is throughout excelent-that of the old man in particalar is masterly. The picture? however, s in-evitably pudnfal. Indeed, its painfulness is in proportion to the vigour of its conception and the perfectness of its execution. Surely this shows that the choice of subject is 'objectionable. The moral of the misery that is 'engendered by crime may be one which it is quite proper to put into impressive pictorial form in a work meant for a court of justice, or any situa-tion in which such a warning lesson maight ,be appropriate. But here, in the first place, we have no clue to guide us in judging whether there is guilt or not. There may be only unafounded asspicion. And, in the next place, this picture is 1.e0n ye nugi 1r-t oue e' epe -3neanu tAlo b_W e hung iu a private house Fe --- ple surely, would like to have anybhing so painful -always before their eyes. The painter might have -avoided this had he shown something to relieve -suspense, to point to hope; had the barri,ter who is leaving the court, for instance, ibeen made to show by his expression and action that he brought news of an acquittaL Depend upon it there is a sound instinct of the true province of art in that feeling which makes a British audience hiss a domestic drama with a painful termination to it. Heroic grief exalts and purifies, but domeatic misery only pains. Equal praise, and something of the same objection, may be extended to another little picture, which justly excites great admiration this yearthe "Sick Child" (61.6), by J. Clark-a name hitherto ulknown, but destined, if the promise of this picture be not belied, to be known far aud wide. The picture is modest in dimensions, quiet, unforced, and natural in drawing, colour, and lieht and shade, but in all these technical particuelr equally admirable. In a small cottage room a rough labourer in corduroy holds loviDgly on his knee a aick child of some four years old, which turns with loathing from the food which its mother is pressing son it with fond importunity. These are delicate indications of undermeaning. A stuffed pheasant over a cupboard may be taken to hint at poaching habits in the father,-a hint borne out by the rabbit on the floor, which we preaume he haa - nared to make a savoury mesa obr the ailing little one. He has put down his p-pe, too, for its sake, and a second child is playing 'with it on the floor. The execution of the picture is so unpretending that it requires close examination to discover what an amount of true finish is lavished on every part-on the heads, dress, and accessories. A stuffed bullfinch in a case over the fireplace is a perfect piece of relief and chiaroscuro. Indeed, no praise we can give for technical merits is beyond the deserts of this little picture. The only objection to it is its literal painfulness. Perhaps, the parental tenderness which is impressed throughout it may be taken as a set-off against this. Mr. 'Waflis, the young painter whose "Cbatterton" was so much admired last year, has two works here, which, excellent as they both are in execution, do not rise to the impressiveness of his last year's picture. The one-" A Sculptor's Workshop, Stratford-on-Avon, A.D. 1617"-(458) represents Gerard Johnson at work on the bust of Shakspeare, for his tomb at Stratford. A friend of the poets,is it meant for Ben Jonson ?-is comparing with the bust a mask after death, which he holds in his hand. From the open window of the workshop you see Stratford church spire rising from its embosoming trees, and the placid Avon, with itswooded banks and floating swans. Some village children are playing about the door, and look shyly at the portly stranger. There is excelent painting all through the picture, very faithful rendering both of figures and foreground accessories, and of the fresh summer landscape in the distance. Mr. WaDis is a young man, and apparently in the full flush of hero-worship. Besides Shakspeare he has this year dedicated a picture to Montaigne. There is a link between the two. One of the very few known autographs of Shakspeare is his name written in a copy of Florio's tranlation of Montaigne, now in the British Museum. With commendable conscientiousness, Mfr. Wallis has painted from the actual room in the Chateau de Montaigne, which still remains in better preservation than most French chateaux of the 16th century. The library in which Montaigne is here seen dictating to his fille d'aUliance, Marie de Gournay, whose platonic attachment to the calm sceptic of 55 forms so singeular an episode in his life. The philosopher is sitting in the warm light of a summer sun, which pours in from an open window-one of those opening on the " trois veues de riche et noble prospece' of which he speaks in the third chapter of his third book. From below you see one of the extinguisher-topped towers of the chateau. The essayist describes hiimself as walking about while he dictated. Here he is seated. Above his head are the beams of the room with their Greek and Latin mottoes, and the figures are relieved by the sober richness of the tapestry which forms the background. The serious and respectful attention of Mademoiselle de Gournay is well expressed, as is the concentration of the dictating philosopher. The picture is throughout thoroughly wefl drawn and painted-at once luminous and solid. Of course, the interest of the subject will be limited to students of the pleasant, genial, gossiping essayist. But it is just the picture, in subject, sentiment, aid style, for the library of a lettered-we should perhaps say a black lettered-bibliophile. Mr. Luard's "Welcome Arrival" is decidedly the most life-like picture of the many to which the Crimean campaign has given rise. In a hut the walls of which are covered by pasted cuts from the IllUstrated News and Punch two officers are engaged in the pleasant task of unpacking a box from home. Its freight of pickles, preserves, sardines, chocolate, potted meats, &c., have been joyously overhauled, and at last the happy fellows have come to more touching gifts of home affection. The one is taking a last look at a miniature before transferring it to the pocket nearest his heart, and the other bas just opened a packet of gloves from a tender mother or fond sister. A visitor who has dropped in looks on with some allovable envy. The picture is capitally painted-evidently from actual study on the spot; the Russian trophies, the old bayonet used as a poker, the saddle on its peg, are aU in nice keeping, and the picture is as well and honestly painted as it is truthfully imagined. Mrs. Ward's " God Save the Queen" is one of the pleasantest little domestic pictures that accomplished lady has yet produced. The fair artist herself is at the piano, accompanying three of her children-a sturdy youngster of nine, a girl of 10, and a chubby little darling of some four or five-in the national anthem. The boy sings out luzatily, full of loyalty, evidently ready to throw dovwn hisgloveagainst all gainsayera of Her Majesty's right and title. The little one is rather uncertain in her notes. Through the open door you see the baby, who has heard the chorus, and is scrambling downstairs to assist at it. It is a charming little scene of middle-class life, rendered with the skill of a painter and the feeling of a mother. Mr. MMaliday's " Sale of a Heart" (683), Miss Boyce's " Our Servant-maid," a good-humoured, homely wench, on the broad grin, leaning with crossed arms out of window, is excellent in expression and in painting. Mr. Barwehl's "Adopting a Child" (614) and Miss E. Osborne's " Nameless and Friendless" (299) both deserve praise, as well-conceived and carefully painted pictures from subjects of contemporary life. The struggle of the poor mother, in the first, between love for her child and desire to advance its intereets and the pause of good feeling on the part of the old gentleman, as he is about to offer her money, are extremely well imagined. There is a great deal of character in the self-important printseller in Miss Osborne's picture, and unobtrusive pathos and unaffected grace in the poor girl who is awaiting his verdict on her work, scarcely daring to hope. Mr. Nichol has a couple of excellent studies of Irish subjects (388 and 390), but he must be careful to keep on the right side of the line which separates character from caricature. Mr. R. Carrick's " Thoughts of the Future" (135) -a mother watching her sleeDing child-is prettily felt and faithfully painted; and another painter of the samne name, Mr. J. M. Carrick, in his " Waiting for the Coach, 16th century " showa perceptions of character and power of painuig it. Mr. Faed's " First Break in the Family " shows continued progress by this clever painter in the technical part of his art with much power of expression. We have seen nothing yet of Mr. Faed's paintinig so solid and careful as the man's figure, who, with bonnet drawn down and compressed features, is watching the coach that whirls off the hope of the household. The hands, in particular, are well drawn, and true in character. There is, however, a tendency to obvious artifice in the grouping, and too much blackness in the shadows, as it seems to us, for an open-air effect. And is not the lassie on the right of the roup too refined In feature and form for her situation in life? Mr. Faed requires to be cautioned against an evident disposition to allow the pleasurable to encroach on the natural. He is quite right in being solicitous to make his pictures agreeable; but he must be careful to reconcile his agreeableness with the probabilities of his subject. What is it that gives value to Dutch and Flemish pictures, even of the lowest life, but their truth? There are some excellent small interiors of Mr. F. DHardy-one in particular (253)-a Christmas party,-which for arrngement and chiaroscuro comes not far short of some of the minor works of Adrian Ostade. Mr. A. Provis exhibits two capital pictures of the same class-Welsh interiors (471 and 1154). Two little pictures by Mr. Galae-" The Confidante" (162) and "The Exile' (392)-are remarkable for thtir perfect miniature-like finish in which they rival Meissonier. The landsape background of 162 is especially deserving of commendation. There is no iudication in this exhibition s0 cheering as the evidence it afyords that our landscape painters are following a safo track in their honest and close study of nature. This. is one advantage we owe to the joint influence dA the pre-Raphaelites and the photograpb. The immediate result is a predominance of landscape studies rather than landscapes. But we can quite afford to wait for the fruits of invention which patient and loving attention to nature is sure to. bear, sooner or later, in strong soils. For those uho have no gift of invention it is better they should abide all their lives in the most literal imitation of what is before them. There are whole ranges of small landscape works which show a patience and powerof transcribing from nature to which a few years snce the exhibition furnished no parallel. Take, for example, the seriesof pictures from (l99) "A Shepherd Boy" (J. J. Hill) to (215) " Craig Dulyn" (J. W. Oakes). Side by tide we may exa- mine with great satisfaction Mr. W. S. Rose's little " Heath Scene near &Ah, Surrey ;` Mlr. H. Moore's " Swiss Meadow in June," knee deep in iti grass and gorgeous growth of scabious and loosestrife, plaiuWsu and olover and sn1apdragon ; Mr. J. I'eel s1% " Quiet Day by tho Tees," 'with its early springtime efftcts of leafless trees, cool gray sky, andquietriver; Mr. C. MIarshall's " Near Llyn Elsie,?' a blowy day, with the wind bending the ragged willown -by the stream, and driving the rain clouds across the sky; Plr.; A. J. Stark's " Quiet Nook,r" with its docks and grasses and hart's-tongue, in which the coot is running to shelter; and,. best of all, Mr. Oakes?s " Craig Dulyn," with its admirably painted fore-. ground of lichen-patched boulder bedded infern and furze, golden'rod, anad hawkweed and heather, all set with spiders' web and gossamer. Nor inferior in truth to the foreground is the middle distanco of plashy bog, with the stream sparkling in its peat-bordered bed, and the distance of hillsides swathed in the stream.of morning mist. This last painter has one of the very bestlandscapes here of the IICarnaryonshire Hlills from Anglesea," where the same features are reproduced on a larger scale, with equal truth. Mr. A. W. Hunt, from the ono of his two ?andscapes in oil, which is hung so as to be] seen, "Leaves on the Turn" (999), seems to be a successful student of the same kdnd of nature as Mr. Oaken. Both are Liverpool artists, and the Welsh hills lie tempting near them. Mr. Hunt's ' Time and Tide " (566) is shamefully ill huDg, but, if -we may judge from what we can rather guess at than see of it, it is a finely conceived and impressive picture. There is a fine solemn feeling aboutMr. Anthony's "Spring in the WYood" (347), though the sky is not quite right. His lone church by the seashore deserved a better place. There is a passage in the distance of storm-cloud lifting over the sea, which, if we are not mistaken, is one of the grandest things in the way of aerial effect in the Exhibitien. Mr. E. C. Booth has a perfectly unaffected And true study of the green stones of a Yorkshire spring head with the grassy vegetation round about them, anid the foam-bells spinniDg away down the stream (484). A new name-B. Leader-is attached to two little subjects " A Stream from the Hills" (268), and " An English Homestead" (592), both excellent in their very different styles. The fist, small as its scale is, rises to impressiveness by the solemn light and shadow of the hills that round in the glen from which the stream leaps out on its downward journey. Mr. M.ason's "Plouhing, in the Campagna" (314), is a spirited remuniscence of country life and scenery near Rome. On a .larger Bcale, and more effective than these slighter works, is the " Mountain Path" of the younger Linnell (136), a picture full of tle brightest sunlight, with a foreground of short green sward clothing the marly bank, over which a scanty stream atsals on its way to the valley, and a pleasant distance of wood, and fallow, and upland pasture, overlooked by the distant mountain-top. Of the elder Liniell's landscape " Where the nibbling sheep do stray," we need only say that it is a good example of his we'l known manner. Mr. Moore's two larger landscapes-" Lausanne" (326) and " Mount Blanc from Mount Servoz " (13) are beautifully painted. The former is ful of the deep peace of summer eventide. The latter is a faithful transcript, as far -as human hand and colours are equal to the task, of the awful beauty of the Giant mountain as the evening light dies from rose to violet upon his flanks and summit. Then there is a whole series of sea-side landscapes from Devonshire-moat of them views of and about Olovelly,by JutBum (1156), Lewis (1158), and others, aU true and carefully painted, and with beautiful effects of calm summer sky. Even after this enumeration we feel that we have left unnoticed many -workrs of unobtrive merit. But we have said enough to bear out the impression which careful atudy of the Exhibition has left upon us, that the sound and healthy study of nature is telling more and more visibly on the work of our young painters. Of the sculpture we would prefer saying nothing, miserably displayed as it is for enabling the spectator to judge of its merits. It is fortunate that the most conspicuous works in the cellar in which sculpture is doomed by our Academy to do penance, as Bailey's "Fox" and MacDowall's "CUhatham," wi hereafter be better seen In their destined place in the New Iouses of Parlament. Miss HIarriet Hosmer's "BeaticeCenci," with much beauty in the face and details, seemstoustofailinthe expression of repose which the artist aimed at. It is a model posed to represent sleep-not a sleeping maiden. 'Mr.;Weekes in his "Young Naturalist" has faUen into the error of attempting to represent in the most rigid of all materials hair and drapery tossed by the wind. His "Mother's Kisa"-the upper part of the figure at least-is beautifully com-.' pozed. Mr. Munro has an exquisite group "The Sisters"(1309), and a very sweet idealized portrait entitled " Beatrice." M r. Brode'sbust of the PoetLaureate, though not without hken ess, as seen inthe front face, fails in rendering the massive dignity of the poet's profile. It is in every way inferior both as a likeness and as a work of art to Mr. Woolner's --rand bust of Mr. Tennyson, lately exhibited at Mr.)ickenson's, in Bond-street. Mr. Woolner has here a bronze medallion of the same head, with others of Browning and Carlisle, capital as likenesses, and showing rare skill in dealing with the difliculties of modelling in low relief. To pretend to pans a judgment on busts displayed as the busts are here, like barbers' blockx or milliners' models, side by side on a shelf, the one destroying the effect of the other, would be an injustice to the artists. Taking the Exhibition as awhole,wbile it presents an unusually small number of works which, either by invention or treatment, enforce admiration and compel notice, it is calculated to inspire us with more than usual hope for the prospects of all classes of art among us except the highest. Under the present conditions of society in this country this is the best we have any right to expect. It is at least a comfort to find but a very small proportion of works in which the ambition of aim only serves to remind us of the want of power. If we are creeping near the ground, at least there is nobody affecting "to strike the stars with head sublime."

ROYAL IZALUN OPXjA. On Saturday night Verdi,s Trviata was procuced forthe first time at this theatre. Tho opera was honoured with a .splendour of costume, scenery, and accessory detail, which would have been more profitably bestowed on some work of greater intrinsic worth. The cast of the three principal characters Was powerful; the subordinate parts were entrcsted to such competent artist as MM Taglfico Polonini, Zelger, &c.; the orchestra and chorus were irreproachable; characteristio dances were irtroduced in the scene of the fete at thie house of llora Barvoix, to accompany the choruses of gipsies and matdors; nothing, in short, vws omitted, to insure completeness as well as magnificence for the representation, and the success was so unequivocal that it is to be feared the _Tmrv;, stands every chance of becoming as much a fixture inthe repertory of the Royal Italian Opera as in that of Her MA. jesty's Theatre. With regard to the chief personages of the drama, for Piccolomini there was Bosoe; for Beneventaso, Grazisni ; and for Giuglini, Mario; zo that, allowing for idiosyncratio differences, the balance was tolerably even. It is not our duty, however, to draw Oompari2sons, bat to describe the actual performance and the enthusiasm it excited, which was of so genuine and unaccustomed a nature that at times it was difficult to believe we were within the narrow precincts of the Lyceum and surrounded by its ordinarily dull and apathetic audience. The singers, instead of being discouraged and thwate in their 1o0st zealous endeavours, were ani. mated to fresh exertions by the warmth and frequency of the applause, and no longer offered up vows for a mobocratic " pit," whose genial fire should neutralize the elegant fri. gidity of stalls and boxes. The whole house, indeed, for once seemed converted into a pit, with hands and voices to pay homage to the surpassing excellence of Malrio and Angiolina Bosiq. No success hitherto obtained by Mdarme Boeio upon the London boards can be mentioned in the same breath with that which she achieved on Saturday, She has evidently made Violetta a special study, and was doubtless urged to. extra diligence by the reflection that, whatever she might accomplish, she would be unable to efface the bewitching image of a certain little " phenomenon" who for a whole season had already held spell-bound that large and influentlal circle of the public in the habit of patronizing the theatre in the Haymarket. We have said it is not our business to institute comparisons; and, happily, in the pre.- seut instance, were we ever so much inclined, the task would be impossible, since no two things-both being good -could be more utterly dissimilar in all respects than the Violetta of Mdlle. Piccolomini and the Violetta of Madame Bosio. The latter takes, so to say,a super-refined view of the character. Her demeanour throughout is quiet and lady. like. She welcomes her guests with grace and affability, but never unbends to excessive vivacity, or gives way to sadden impulses of passion. Her joy and her grief are equally tranquil and subdued. Madame Bose's conception of Violetta, to be understood, most be regarded as a whole, under which condition it can hardly fail to be appreciated as a well-considered and highlyfinishedportrait. Anexhibition of greater intensity might be wisbed for in the scene where Alfredo wrings the heart of the miserable courtesan by publicly outraging and insulting her; the. feint, at least, of more exuberant spirits might be de5irable in the first act, where she joins Alfredo in the drinking song, and a deeper measuu of significance accorded to the line " Dig dche viver cncor fo"ri-_ when, the doctor being sent for, a gleam of hope springs up in the breast of Violetta, and the desire to live for the .over who is restored to-her becomes the one vehement and engrossing thought. These pointb,like bold tints in appropriae plces, would have strengthened rather than deran ed the general harmonyof thepicture. MadameBosio'sexecution of the music was jast what everyone counted on-artistically finished, brilliant, andvocally effectivefromend to end. The well-known air, "A-h forte e lui," at the end of the first act, was aike remarkable for thepathos of the andante and the wonderful neatness and flaenc with which the nuick movement "Sempre liberacdegg'io" wasdelivered. iihecontrast between the opeoning, wereViolettadwells fondly for a moment on the idea of a pure affec. tion, and the climax, when throwing aside the illhion, she declares her intention to go on pursuing the recldess life she has hitherto led, vwas powerfully marked, and after the fall of the curtain Madame Bosio was twice called forward and unanimously. applauded. Her last solo, the plaintive air, "Addio del passato," where the wretched outcast abandons herself to despairandinvokesthe mercy of Heaven, was rendered withadmirablefeeling, although, perhaps, the notioa of moze utter prostration of spirit might have been his. trionically conveyed. In the rest of the music of Violetta Madame Bosio m6st not be separated from Signor Mario, whose Alfredo was faultless, both as a dramatic impersonation and as a display of vocal excellence. The manly and at the same time pturesque appearanoe of the great Italian tenor gave pro. Cability to the story, and poetically accounted for the devotion of the unfortunate lady to whom Alfredo has become attached. The first sensation was created by the broad and vigorous style in which he delivered the introductory stanza or the drinking song, "Libism ne' lieti calici," which was loudly encored and repeated. In the succeeding duet, "Un di felice," it is difficult to say whether the passionate expression of Mario-the prince of love-makers, where music IS the medium of communicat?on-or the exquisite refinement and delicacy of Madame Bosio, in the response, deserved most praise. The duet, from first to last, was listened to with eager interest; and at the termination of the act Mario shared the applause and the recals with his accomplished partner. The air, " De miei bollenti"-of which Signor Giuglini makes so much, nd which is AIfredo's only solo, though delightfully sung, produced less effect than had been looked for; but the duet in the final a^t, ",Parigi, o cara," which illustrates the last interview between the lovers, and anticipates the death of Violetta, was all that could be imagined; no singIng could be more expressive, no acting more natural and touching. In short, the Alfredo of Signor Mario, like the Violetta of Madame Bodio, is a new and striking feature in the present operatic season. SIgor Graziani conveyed a good notion of the elder Germont, and sang the semi-sentimental romance, " Di Pro. verza iI mare," the long duest, where the anxious father prevails upon Violetta to resign AIfredo, and the rest of the music in which he was concerned, with great intelligence; and we 'have little doubt that when quite rcovere-d from his indisposition, which unavoidably retarded the first performance of La Tras-ia& from Thursday till Saturday, be willsing it even better, and do more justice to his beautiful voice.

MR. TV. RUSSELlS ZECUBU.z. On Saturday evening tho interesting narrative that has so mcnh occupied the attention of the public -was brought to its termination. The inconveniences endured at Balkiva the high price, charged for the necessaries of life, and thoindifferent q,uity of the articles so dearly purchased were set forth in the early Part of this third division of the narrative ; the position oe Mr. Russell himse3f, using gunpowder and water for ink eld wiriting w ith a quill plucked from the only goose in the camp, forming a ludicrous symbol of the general state of things. The "'brilliant tiitle victory" gained by Sir D)e Ioy Esvans over a reconnoitring party of Rnisne cnIee in as an- episode in the story of Balkiava, and the lecturer dwelt on it with the more emphai as he sid that it had never received its due are of honour orreward. The battle of Inkermann was a difficult subject to treat, froa the fact that it rely admitted of no description, being Composed, as Mr. sRaeij remarked, of isolated coAnlicts, Perpetual rallies, and " duels" between individuals. Nevertheless he pured the-e disointed detils with great accuracy, and then, after admitting the great. nesa of the victory, declared that it afforded no uso for rejoicing, obtained, as it had been, at the cost of 0 mnuch valuable life. Hoywever, not to countenanoe the Russian verion of tbetale, according to which the French and English suffered more severely than their enemy,. he described a caicature circulated in the country of the Czar as a utire on the false statements, of the Russian newspapers. A mob of soldiers presents itself at, the celestial gate, representingthatit is composed of the Russian soldiers who fell at -Ikermaun, but is repelled 'by St. Peter, who regards his applicants as Impostors, on the ground that they iumber several thousands, whereas, according to the newspapers, only a few hundreds were killed. The barbarity exercised by the Rusiam towards the wounded on the battle-field had the effect of deadening the ftelings of humanity naturally inherent In the British soldier, and: this moral - degeneracy was illustrated by an aneodote, half comic, half horrible, of a dying Rusdan, who ws on the Point of being buried alive by acme English soldiers, simply because his case was hopeless. The heavy gales that tormentod the little armn (now reduced toa.bout 16,000):inthe autumnfurnished matterfor come grotesque description, which soon doepened into. a tloomy picture of the pestilence that hated with a3l its details of fith and wretchedness till the road from Balaiklava was co0-rnoed. Occasion was here taken to advert to the horrors of Scutari, and the zeal of "the gentle' man who had the administration of the funds oonfided to a news paper " for the relief of the sick and wounded receied .an especial acknowledgment. The despairing listlessness that preceded the final operations, and was checkered by de. sertion from the army of the allies to that of the Russians, ws lamented by Mr. Russell as many anillar case of procrastination had been lamented before. If the French refused to commnence the sault earlier, why, he askod, did the Eng' "s always yield to the refusal? He had, indeed, heard of regrets expressed by the French that they were always bept back from the ssault, but on this subject he w as a thorough nnbeliever. The "affair" of the Mamelon and the Redan occupied most of the re. naining portion of the lecture, and the doscription of the unfortunate assault of the latter formed, perhap@, the most interesting.episode of the whole narrative. Force, accuracy, and vivacity wvere combined. The "tiger-springe' of the French upon the Malakhoff, which was the concluding achievement of t4e tale, came as a contrast in every respect to the description of the asault on the Redan. The lecturer was in the ml dst of one affair, and recorded his immediate impressions. In the second the manner in which a distant occurrence gradually reialed itself to the mind of spectators watchingthe course of events with painful interest was finely described. So great has been the success of Mr. Russells lectres that they will be repsated .t .the same rooms (Wilises) on the afternoons of tne 23d and 28th inst. and the lst of JuneThe subscribers to the second series may be promised even a greater treat than that presented to the patrons of the fir Although a thorough, proficient in descriptive witing, Mr. Rvsell was a complete novice in the art of lecturing when ie mounted his rostrum on Monday last, and his discourses during the past week have been to him an initiation into'a new mystery. Hence, while the publio has watched with anxiety the progress of events in the Crimea, the friends of Mr. Russell have with scarcely less anxiety watched the progress of the lecbrer himself. With infinite delight did this kindly lttle party perceive that the nervousness and' hesitation in delivery' which had been noticed on the Monday, and still more on tho Thursday, bad almost entirely disappeared on Satur. day. When he resumes his series on Saturday next he will bave paseed through a novicate during which he has been aided by the counsels of the best practical critics that the world could afford,-men who were acquainted with him personally, and could compare his manner in the lecture-room with his manner in private society; men who had witnessed the same events as himself, and coud constUntly recall old pleasntries to his memory;. men who nave: been the leading minds in entertainments that have attracted thousands, and who contributed largely from the stores of their experience. It is not too much to' say that all the choice. spirits whose names could be used as somanyprss-words at every institution orassomblyconnected' with literature, art, or amusement, have beeu as much interested in Mr. Rusiell's success as they could have been had their own private advantage depended upon it.
THE DASTBUCTION OP SALMON. TO TEE EDITOE OF TELE, TIMES. Sir,-The salmon traps or cages attached to woius are by far the greatest destroyers of th-e fih; all other efforts are puny in compariwn. I have observed that this pirt of the sabject has not been tonuched upon by any or your correspondents except "Piscator Urnm.1 Yet ro one perhaps is able to give more valuable inforination upon it than Mr. William Ayrton, of Chester, for he is the lessee of the cage upon the Dee. Every fish that arrives at the pool below the weir must go into the ca"e, or wait for some opportunity of etting over the weir, such as a high tide or a flood in the nlver; but so great is the anxiety of the salmon to get up the stream that, havig found an obstacle in the wrexr, they rash at once at the pomnt that appears to give them an outlet, and thus I do not think I am exaggerating v.hen I say that oat of every 10t fish goingup ninc are caught in the trap during the time Every fish that Mr. Ayrton talces in the cage at Chester represents 10,000 '"penks or "'samnlets," and if he would oniy open it for one season all fears as to the txtirpation of samon in the River Dee might be lid aside. I do not, of course, advocate the closing of all traps, for ish must be had for consumption, and it is only in a case like Mr. Ayrton's, whete he apprehends tho total extinction of the tribe, that I would recommend the cage being closed. for so long a period. But if 'we are to have leglslation on the sdmon question, it is imperative that attention 8hould be turned to the 'wholesalo destruction of the breeding fish in these traps, as well as to the capture of the young fry. It is true that there are certain "fence days" in the latter part of the season-September, I think-when fishing by the trap Is prohibited oy law; but that is not enough. If we really desire to encourage the breeding of this valuable fish, it must be enacted that every trap be kept open so as to allow the fish to panthroh at least two days inthe week besides Sunday. At present I believe the traps fish every day, Sandays and allm I am, Sir, your most obedient servant. dUh.N FUANOI COLLJER. London, May 15. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In allusion to Dr. Esdaile's startling communica. tion respecting the wholesale dcstruction of salmon, and in the belief that the subject was one of pablic interest, I mentioned in my letter of the 6tk inst. several enactments which are sufficient (if enforeed) to prevent the destruction of which that intelligent gentleman com- ains, and I suggested a change in the law of fishery property which would prevent breaches of the existing penal suttutes. Mly incidental admission of being profesionally connected with a company who have an interest in the observance of these laws in their own district was only a plea for a hearing; but this admission, which ras at all events honest, has evoked an onslaught from "Piseator Olm," who, with more humour than logic, and under an erroneous imtression, indirectly charges me'with amition and sefinterest. To the former count of his indictment I plead gilty, if it imply a dedro to prmot the pblic wral; and any other iimputtion o0uld ho simpply ridculous.

THE S4 CIZTY OF LOHDOH ZlxcTION. TO THE EDITOR OF THEF TIES. Sir,-Thosewh>tookaiinterest in thelate election for the ity of London wae indebted to Mr. White, the hon. eeete iar of. Lord JoDhn ' sell's committee, for a complete p;alyss of all the votes recorded on the oocaon, which 'hrows much light upon the action of parties in tbt oantest. The analsis which I subjoin below abhows the number, which rfpectih ly voted for each candidatesingly, andbor each of the various combinations which can be formed. among them. Probably few electors were aware that tliey had the choice of no lea than 30 different ways in which they could exercise their franchise; and this 3i not a ra theoretical possibility, for the nyi showa that the voter8 have, in fact, exhausted all the posseble combinations, and it therefore becomes necessary to dist-jbute them into as manr aS thirty distinct classes. A few words of explaation wilL help to bring out the meaning of the analytical table. The contest in the city wasbetween Lord John Ruff on the one side, and four candidates proposed by the Libiral Registrtion Assocition on the other. The four candida& thus brought forward were Rothschild, Duke, COwford, and Currie, the two former of whom were old membrs, and the two latter new men intended to supply the place of Mr. Masterman, who retired, and of Lord Jobn Ruesell, whom the Association v,ished to exclude. The four adidates acted in concert, maldng use for-their common. benefit of' the electioneering organization of the Association, whose efforts were directed to getting- th6ir friends to vote for all four candidates jointly. Lord Jo6 Rusaell stood alono, and had the services of a band of Tolunteera w'hosa object w7as to obtain votep for him either SiflyI (i. a, in election language, plumpers) or in conjunction with any other caudidate.the voter felt ,dispoeedto support. 'In this way the canvass was carried on for both parties, and. finally the result of the poll as shown by the offcial declaiation was that Lord John oocupied the niiddle place, polling 1789 votes more than Cuirrie, 500 more than Crawford,''9 less than Rothschild, and 356 les thau Duke. There is some difference between the n-mbersgivesat the declartion and those derived from the analytical taDle, but the latter as well as the former beiug made out from the poll-boolc we cannot prononnce which is the most correct. Botk reclkonings are given below, and it will be seen that the differenoe is too small to affect any general reslts. The total number of electors who recorded their votes ir 11,174; of these 2,512 voted for all the four associated candidatei; this therefore shows the strength of the partywho followed the directions of the Registration Association. It is considerably less than one-fourth of the number who voted, and forms but a small proportion even of the votes given for their ovn candidates, Thus Duke, who reoeivecl 6,657 votes in all, was indebted to the partisans of the Association for 2,512, the remainder, amounting to 4,$45u being'nmade up by Toters who did not follow the lead of that body. The next class in point ofnumbers is that which consists of voters whogave plumpers to Lord John, and amounts to, 1,906. This clas is made up of distinct sets of persons acting from different motives,-viz-first, the stanch friends of Lord John desiring at all hazards to make dim safe; secondly, of Liberals who, under ordinary circumstaces, would have split their votes with other caudidatese but, disapproving the conduct of the Association, would not vote for any of those brought forward by it; thirdly,, of Conservatives, who, though differing in political opinions, nevertheless did not wish to see a respected public mea thrust asido. It is diffcult to calculate the relative numbers of these scts; but the feeling aroused by the proceedings of the Association with regard to Lord John was so strong that a large number of his supporters determined to mark their condemnation, in the strongest manner, and. adopted this as the most direct vote that could bo givei against the Association; it is probable, therefore, that these formed a large portion of the plumpers. With regard t0 the Conservatives there is no means of ascertaining directly what proportion they makee up; but from the fadt that so great a number of LIberal voted in this way, and that about 8,000 persons whose names appear on the register did not vote-at all, the great body of whom, no doubt, belonged to the Conservative party, it may be safely conjectured that they formed only a minority of the class The next class numbers 1,063, and consists of those who voted for Russel, Rothschild, Dnke, and Crawford. This vote represents those who wished to retain the three old members, and as their new member preferred Crawford to Crrlo. The corresponding vote against Crawford, i. e., for Russell, Rothschild, Duke, and Cnrie, numbers only 143, which indicates the comparative popularity of the two new candidates. Those who' voted for Russell and Rothschild follow next in order, and amount to 891. - These again are made up, of two sets--first, the friends of Rusel who gave a second vote to Rothschild; and, secondly, the friends of Rothschild who gave a second vote to Russell. It is remarkable that these two sets combinod should not have reached a higher figure. On tho ground that Baron Rothschild represented a great principle, with which both he xnd Lord John were both identified, and in anticipation that the Jewss would almost universally give a vote to Lord John, very many supporters of the latter determined to lend Baron Rothschild their aid. Had this anticipation been realized the numbers comprised in this class would have been immensely increased, but it appears from the analysis that 540 voter,, who xmay almost without exception be set down as Jews, gave plumpers for Rothschild. In addition, therefore, to the Jews who adopted the other candidates with whom Rothschild had combined, aud who would be included in the 2,512 voters mentioned abovo, a further body of 540, forming no incensiderable portion of the Jewish electors, withheld their support from Lord John. If the total number of votes given for Lord John in any combination with Rothschild be reckoned up they will be found to amount to 2,977 ; while the total number in any combination with Duke amounts to 2,819, or within 158 of the former number, thus showing that the assistauce which Lord John received from and gave to Duke's party was nearly as great as what hereceived from and gave to Rothschild's party. Bat the manner in.vhich the Jews voted is shown still more clearly by examining the state of the poll in the ward of Portsoken, where their numbers greatly preponderate. 495 persons voted in this ward and the numbers were:- Total numeor Number of of votes. pi em Itnaeil .1. .. .. ..

I have now referred to the most important votes, and the other items of the analysis are of less interest; some of them amount to a considerable number, as the 599 who voted for Russell and Duke, and the 442 who gave plmnpers to Duke, both of 'which nmay be taken as representing the strength of the corporation party, with whom Dake was the favourite. 480 voted for Russell, Duke, Crawford, eurrie, and represent the body of Liberals opposed to the admission (f theJeows.

At the very moment he will be supposed to leave the King of Bavaria will enter that celebrated cbAteau, so full of Imperial reminiseences, and where the table on which the abdication of the first Napoleonwas signed serves as a standing memento to his successor. Thus, in the succession of niighty Princes who come to " incline themselvea" before the Inpe. rial throne there is no absolute solution of continuity, any more than in the varied sports of which Fontainebleau is the theatre is there a single lucid interval. With these crowned heads, these Iraperial, Royal, and Serene Elighnesses (for the Duke of Nassau seems to occupy permanently the post of 'mbm), and with the weather at a July heat, the splencdour is too oppressive. I hope it may last, and that it wlfl not be followed by any casualty, as the storm is sure to follow when the sky is charged with electricity from too long and too intense a heat. King Maximilian of Bavaria will mask his splendour under the transparent envelope of an incognito till he reaches Lyons. But the brother of the interesting Otho will come on poor Marshal Castellane in that favoured city like a "scunburst." At Lyons aidea-de-camp, orderlies, and other "walking gentlemen" of the Imperial household are awaiting His BMajeaty's arrivaL Marshal Castellane, M. Vaisse, Senator, the Prefect and Mayor of Lyons, aswell as all the civil and milltary authorities, are on the pi vice.

Vigilant persons will take their stand on the castle of Fontamebleau to announce when they " see anythiDg coming ;" and a great officer of the Crown wiU be in attendance to conduct His Majesty to the Palace, " when the Emperor will receive him at the foot of the grand staircase, the Empress and her ladies remaining above." So the official programme runs. The King is expected on Sunday. In the meantime the Paris papers continue to ,,ive an account in the following terms of the doi'gs at Fontainebleau:- " I narrated to you in my last some of the Incidents of the grand stag-hunt of Tuesday. That same evening the curee took place in the ConarOvale; the stag, it appears, was at last brought to bay not far from the Gorge aux TIoups at about 6in the evening, andwas almost instantly kiUll There seems to be no doubt that two other stags were folloved by some of the dogs in the course of the day, the scent lying badly, in consequence of the extreme warmth of the weather and the dry condition of the ground. The main body of the dogs followed exceedingly well, and at last ran down their game in really galant style. It was about 9 o'clock when the Imperial party, on quitting the dinner party, placed themselves at the windows looking into the conrt to witness the curious spectaole of breaking up the stag by torchlight. Nothing could bo more curious than the strange eftects of light and shade, as the blaze of the torches fell alternately on the buntsmen on horseback, the dogs held in by the grooms placed in charge of them, and the persons appointed to cut up the animal, aecording to the longestablished regulations of venerie. When the head was separated Erom the body of the animal, the skin having been removed, the dogs were brought up three times to the parts of the body which they were to be permitted to make their own, and then, at a given moment, all were let loose together. Then a tremendous rush forward took place, and in a moment they had devoured the prey which the day's exertions had justly entitled them to. The horns sounded the morc at the same moment, but the furious barking of the hounni almost overpowered the sound. At last the grooms called the dogs in, and it was wonderful how soon their excitement was reduced to comparative quietness. They were then led away, and the strange and animated sceno concluded. Another grand hunt, I understand, will takeplaco on Saturday, bat the place of rendezvous is not yet appointed. Yeaterday the Imperial party took a long drive about 3 o'clock in the forest, in chars-d-banc and open carriages. Tbo Emperor, the Empress, the Grand Dake Constantine, the Grand Duchess of Baden, the Duches3 of Hamilton, and the Prince of Nassau were in the same char-d-banc. The main body of the guests folowed in other vehicles, the whole oort4ge being preceded by ML Lecldre, Inspector. General of Forests. A small number of gentlemen accompanied the carriages on horsebaok. The Court proceeded by tho Route de Fleury to the Gorges de Franchart, where their Najesties and the rest of the party alighted and walked about for some time. The weather was delightful, and nothing could be more beautiful than the forest. They aft-3rwards drove on by the Route de la Fatale towards the Bouquet du Roi, one of the finest oaks in the whole forest, shooting aloft to an immense height as straight as an arrow, the trunk being not less than 22 feet in circumference at its base. Their Majesties again alighted here, and the vrhole party remaihed walking about in the neighbourhood for about an hour. The band of the Grenadiers of the Guard had been sent on beforehand, and, at a little distance, played overtures and other select pieces. Their Majesties again pur. sued their way, passing in front of the magnificent oaks which every one acquainted with the fore3t admires so much -the Pharamond and the Twins-and then, by the Route de la Roche qui Plenre, arrived at the Palace at 7 o'clock. In the evening there was a grand dinner, the ladies being in full toilette and the gentlemen in Court dress, consisting of bluo ooat lined with white silk, black shorts, and silk stockings, with sword and hat. After dianer there was a thea'ril cal representation in the theatre just finished, the arti3tes of the Th6atre Francais being the porformers. The new theatre has been erected in the wing Louis XVL, in the style of the Renaissance, and is of extraordinary richness, the ground being white aud gold, and the hangings amber-coloured satin with gold ornaments. Their Majesties occupied the seats in the centre; the Grand Duchess of Baden and the Princess Mathilde were seated at the Empsror's right, and the Grand Duke Constantine and the Duchess of Hamilton at the Empress's left. Her Majesty wore a dress of white crape, with flowers embroidered en chenille, wild flowers iu her hair, and three rows of pearls round her neck. Her Majesty looked in excellent health, with a fine colour, from so much exercise in the open air. The Grand Duchess was in white satin covered with lace, and wore a profusion of diamonds. The Princess Mathilde was in pirk, with pearls, and a large imedallion of diamonds; and the Duches, of Hamilton in white tarlatan with pink rib%uds passed through the flounces, and the whole glittering with diamonds. The Emperor wore the grand cordon of S:. Michael, and Prince Cea.tantine the grand cordon of the Legion of Honour. About 300 persons were present, and the whole presented a most brilliant appearance, from the quantity of diamonds worn. The pieces given were 7Une TemLpet deans un Vcre d'Fau, by M. L6on Gozlan, ani Le htar Q la Caimpagne, by Bayard. Both pieces were admirably played, and the Imperial audience were evidently mush amused. Notwithstanding the number of the guesb here, there is no difficulty wEhatever in affording acco mmoda. tion,everything isco well arranged. TheRussian Prince occupies an apartment in the wing of Louis XV., over the Cour du Cheval Blanc, and other persons more immediately belonging to the intimate circle of the Emperor, such as the Princesses, the Prince of Nassau, &c., in the part of the palace occupied by Pino VIL The whole of the guests have now arrived, and I find that I was in error when I informed you in a preceding letter that the Countess Castiglione forms one of the party assembled here. I am informed that nothing 7s more delightful than the life led at the pnlaco, in consecunence of the graceful attention and hospitable kindness of their Majesties. The Emperor, Indeed, never appears to greater advantage than in the intinmate intercoure, of private life, where the high position of the host Is forgotten in his desire to make every one around him happy. This day the Court dines in the forest the repast being a cold collation, a sort of picnic of the choicest description. The sot is not decided on until the moment arrives, as fonrgons with every requisite follow the carriages; and w7here the place, the hour, and the apuetite are propitious, the word .8 given, and the table is laid ont in a fewv minutes. There 'gooddigestion waits on appetite, and health On beth.'"' I may add that the idea of lodging the Grand Duke at the Hotel du Louvre was abandoned at the last moment. Instead of taking up his quarters en ga_sonm at that caravanserai, he occupies the Pavilion Marsan. A private letter from Naples, of the 10th, mentions thAforsome dayshopeawereentertainedinthatcityof berzesumption of diplomaticrelations with England; that Lord Clarendon appeawred to have manifested a -desfre,to that effect, but that " the exigencies" he bet-1orth have prevented the realization of these hopes. "The King of Naples," the letter says, e' caused it to be made known in London that, in hiseyes, they implied an idea of intervention, which was inconsistent with the dignity and the interests ofsan independent State-an intervention opposed to the prinoiples professed b;tho English nation itself, and contrary to the preceding declarations of the Western Power." Aaother letter from Naples informs us that Signor Gasparini, a distinguihed l-eapoima botanist, has bten appointed by the Aushrlan Govemment to X Profeszorclrip in the University of Paviai under peculiar ciscumaauces. Signor Gaaariiu hold a situation in the Univerity of hi native countyt in the yOar 1848. Although he never took any parb in politics, he was deprived of his situation by the King of Naples, after his violation of the Constitution, and was reduced to great poverty. Signor Gasparini made sever&l applications to the Neapolitan Government to be reinstated, but without BUCCess. En the meantime a learnd botanisb from Vienna visited Naples, and, finding the melancholy position to which Signor Gaspgiini was reduced, promised that he would procura a situation for him in the LIombardo-Yenetian; provinces, which he gratefully accepted. The Neapolitan Government, however, interfered, and declared that the King would see with displeasure one of his disgraced professors appointed to an official situation by a friendly Government. So the. mattbr rested until the late visit of th6e Emperor of Austria to bis Italian dominibns, when His Majejty, by at Imperial decree, dated th9 13th of March? appointed Signor Gasparini Piofemsor of Botany Ithe Uni versity of Pavia. WhenBaron Martini, the Austriai Minister at Naples, announced his appointment he added, "H His Maiesty sends you near the froxiierx of Piedmout, for he is determined to compete with the Kling of that eountry in extending education and protecting the arts andw sciences in Italy." A letter from Rxome announces th1at Pius IL. arrived at Asaisi on the 7th inst.,. and that on thb day following the holy father left for Perugia. The eapos5 des motifs of the bill prcoented oa Wednesday to the Legislative Body for modifying Art. 1 of the OrgaDic decree relative to the election of deputies assigns the foUlowing as the reasons which call for the change:- i "Accordlng tothe terms of the constitution there muit be one deputy for every 35,000 elorsm In attributin4, cording to this provison, to each department one deptt for every 35,000 eleotors, Mt. lof tlhe otganio decree of the 2d February, 1852 states that departmentsin which the 4 ditional number of electors amoumts to 25,000 sha ihave one deputy mo It is on these bases that the electons for the present Legislative Body, which reckons 261 members took place. Since these eleotions, however, thise number of: electors has changed in severalof the departts; in soiae it has increased, and in other diminished. Thusathedepart. ment of the Seine and of the Loire, in consequence of the cugmentation in the number of their electors, have eha,rightto onedeputy more. Ninedepartmeuts,ontheoontt* -theCotes'du-Nord, Gers, Indreat-LoRre, Puy.de-Daom, Haute-Saone, Sarthe, Seine-et-Mare, Somme, and tbeV ar -have had their electors dlmelid, and must each loS one deputy. Followingrg, therefore, theprovslonsof theorganic' decree, the next Legislative Body would only consWt of 254 members, Instead of 26L That result, which - Wfould deprive nine departments of a representative, exoited the attention of the Government, and It conceived that without infringing on the constitution it might by a simple modification of the organic decree maintain the present state of things and even enlarge the bases, It therefore proposes to fix at 17,501 instead of 25,000( the surplAs number of electore giving a right to an additional deputy. The result of this modification would be to maintain for the abovementioned departments, with the exception of that of the Cotes-du-Nord, their present number of representatives. It would, besides, give an ad. ditional one to the departments of the A.Uier, Corsica, the Loiret, and the Meuse. The adoption of the bill will there. fore open the doors of the Legisative Body to three new deputies, and, as the departments of the Seine and the Loire have a right by the increase In the number of their electors each to one deputy more, there Will in the whole be five more deputies to elewt, and the number of members of the Legislative Body will be 266 instead of 26L"2 The receipts of the Paris and Orleans Railway Company for the week ending the 6th May amount to 1,147,965f.36c., belng an increeof 264,505f. 68c., as compared with the ohwesponding week of lat year.

The crime of murder is making lamentable progress in France, but, strange to say, the cases are comparativelyfew in thegreat townL Thevillages and agricultural districts in general supply the hideous announcementa which are to be found in every number of the Gazee des Tribn4naux. The case I ain about to record will astonish even those who still remember the name of Thurtell and other miscreants of his class. x Lechaux, a retired builder and a member of the Municipal Council, 64 years of age, resided with his son and two daughters in the village of Olivet, in the Department of the l oiret. The old gentleman, who had lost his wife some time since was paralytic. A misunderstanding existedbetween the father and son relative to the partition of the property belonging to the late Madame Lechaux. One day last week the old man returned home after a drive in his carriage; his daughter assisted him to alight, and at the same moment his son approached, and, in an angry tone, asked his father how he dared to dispose of some timber without his permission. Thence an altercation ensued, when the son laid hold of his father by the collar, and the latter raised his cane. The son seized the end of the cane, and by means of it drew the old man towards his workshop. There he loosed the cane, and suddenly seizing a carpenter's axe struck at his father. The daughter, however, who clung to her father, warded off the firat blow. The parricide, who is a man of herculean strength, struck again, and wounded his father in the shoulder. Not satisfied with that, he struck a third time, and with such force that he cat through the face and severed the carotid artery. Lechaux then fell, and the daughter, who had used every effort to prevent the perpetration of the crime, fled, terrified at the ghastly aight and screaming for assistance. The parricide in the meantime quietly picked up the murdered man's cane, placed it care-i tulY bme the aX:e, ancl went upr -I Ihis room and locked himself in. There he sat down at his desk, receipted some accounts, and, to uise hia own pression, "set his affair in order." The officers of justice having been apprised of what had occurred went to the house, knocked at the door of the parricide's room, and commanded him to open it in the name of the law. " Presentlv," replied he, "in a few minutes, . . . H ave patience; I will not destroy myself; I will not do my family that honour. I wi die on the scaffold." The officer insisted, and the door wasfinally opened. The Imperial attorney, accompanied by an officer and two Gendarmes, proceeded to interrogate the parricide, who coolly confessed his crime, adding, " It must have happened sooner or later." Antoine Lechaux, who is 40 years of ago, unmarried, and posseswed of an independent fortune, wascommitted to the prison of Orleans at 10 o'clock at night, followed by an immense crowd, who waited several hours to catch a glimpse of the sin. His trial will take place at the approaching assizes. The Three per Cents. closed to-day at 69f. 45. for the end of the month, and the Four-and-aHalf per Cents. at 91f. 40c.

On Monday last an address, bearing tho signatures of some 200 Hungarian nobleg and notables, was presented to the Emperor by the Primate of Rungary. This document is not to the tae of the Adminitration, and is therefore not likely to be made puiblic, but I am enabled to gsive you a correot idea of ib contents. In the short speech which the Emperor addressed to the nobility on the day of his arrival at'Buda he observed that he had come "to inquire into the wishes and necessities of the ugarans' ." The words of His fajesty gave great pleasure to the nobles, and they oa the following day resolved to draw up a " loyal!' address, in which should be specified the principal wishes and wants of the nation. The Haungarians ar well aware that the Emperorneither can nor will restore Hungary to its former seraindependent position, and consequently no tion is made of self-government in the addres. As was said in a former letter, the Hungrians eintertain the conviction that the force of circumstanceo will sooner or later render it necessary to modify the present system of rigid centrlization, but at present all matters of high political imiportanca are left in abeyance, and the Emperor is simply petiioned to prohibit aniy further attempts to ' introduce the German instead of the Hungarian Ianguage into the schools, public courts, and lower C-overnrent offices, and to make those changes in the provincial administration which are conaidered necesary by aU those persons who have a more intimate knowIedge of the pecaliarities of the country and of its inhabitants. The addrens is here attributed exclusively to the "old Conservatives," but during my- short sojo,unat P hopportunitiespresented themselves of conversng with Liberals as well as with conservatives, a:sid there was no difference of opinion be'tweei- th6 two parties' in respect to the, 1- miunitration' They both affirmed tbat it was most unsustible to the neciseities of the kingdom, -and attribu ted the general discontent of -the nation to the 'Want of tact of the eswployis, "who behaved exactly as-if 'they 'had to-do with a; disaffected and di&l6yal race." It inust be repeated tiat the imprea sion produced on my mind while ih Hungaryv-as that the-nati6naW8Miseontented, butnot disfected. During prolonged ad 'confidsntial conversations with men of the' most o'pposite political opinions, not one sentiment was exprested that was at asl hostile to the Imperial family. The story told by all was,thatHungary waflled withmploy6s who did not understand their busines, and that tho txes were too heavy for a countty which had not recovere I from the heavy losses suained in the years 1813 and 1849. During the war in the Crimea the Huugariansdid not feel the burden of the taxes very heavily, as they got enormously high prices for their produce, but now that corn fetches a very low price they find It extremely difficult to discharge their obligations'to the Stite. ln 1855 the crops in Prsia partally failed, and the consequence was that the Hungariaen obtained enormous prices for their wheat and rye. Reliable information has been given me that the confiscated pro. perty of the persons Included in the amnesty granted on the 8th instant will be restored to them. The Imperial ordinance on the subject is said to be already in the hands of the Minister of Justice. The Wiener Zeutung contains the subjoined letters, which were addressed by the Emperor to the Governor-General of Hungary "De1 rCousin, Arohduke Albrech"-It is my wil that a full-length atue shall be ereed in Peth to the memory of my unle, the late Archduke Joseph. " The expense of the some is at first to be defrayed out f the sms already In band (voluntary subscriptions), and If they should prove isfficient, you, my well beloved, wilt ask my instrctions relative to any further outlay that m3y be necessay. - "FRANCIS JOSEPH. "Buds, may 9. 1857." "Dear Cousin, Arhdluke Albredht,-l; in the way of V-0, ordain that after the beginning of the year 18i8 no further ontribution towards the fund for rebuilding - my cssUe at Buda shall be raied, and it is my will thi the sums already paid in shall be employed to the adv,ntage of the country in the following way:-240,00 for the furterance of agiculture and for the improved ma nagement of woods and forests by means of schools, stipends, and prizes, and by the completion of a model vineyard at Buds; 120,001. for forming foundations at. the Theresianumi" (the academy for nobles in Vienna is so called]; "90,0001. for forming endowments for noble Hungarins; 45,0001. for the formation of stipends fer the daughters of Imperial em.Ploy6s in Hungary; 50,000L. towards the National Museum at Peeth; 24,0005. for the foundation of stipends for artists; and 300,000L for the construction of a lunatio asylum in Hlungary. " Buda, May 9,1857. FRACTIS JOSEPH." In order that the foregoing may be intelligible toyour readers it is neoesary to state that the inhabitants of Pesth were fined a sum of 2,500,000fl. as anu indemnification for the injury done to Imperial property during the bombardment of Buda In the year 1839. The Emperor has also made the Hungarian Agricultural Society a present of 3,000a., which had been advanced to it by the State.- His Majesty, who WrA at the municipal ball at Buda until 11 o'clock in the evening of Monday, and in the Agricultural Exhibition from 10 until 2 o'cloek yesterday, returned to Pesth at 5 in the evening. When the Emperorvisitel that pert of the " Augarten" in which the English machinery is placed he was loudly cheered by the workmen, whose "Hurrahs" seemed to astouni the Austrias. However, the natives joined in th hurrah of the foreigners when His Majesty left th i exhibition. It was generally remarked that h3 ppeared to be in excellent health and spirits. Yesterday the Empress rode in the mountains in the neighbourhood of Buda, and passed the evening in the National Theatre. At 7 this morning their Majesties were to leave Pesth for Jasz-Bereny. The following particulars relative to the capture of the notorious Rosza Sandor have been received from Szegedin.:-For some time the bandit had been the guest of a certain Paul Katona, but one day he suspected that he had been betrayed by his entertainer and,friend, and fired a pistol at his head. The wife of Katona was so incensed at the brutal attack on her husband Lhat she felled Rosza Sandor to the earth with an axe, bound him hand and foot while he was senseless, and then called inthe Gendarmes. Eatona was wounded, but In doing well. Telegraphic intelligence has just been received that the Emperor reached Peeth between 12 and 1 in the morning. The Princess Gisel7a is still unwell, and the journey to Jasz-Bereny has been postponed. RUSSIA. (rROx o0n BERL= cO BBMONDMM.) -BERLIN, bEsY 14. The latest news that we have received from St. Petersburg will astonish the gentlemen in St. Bartholomew's-lane, and at the same time offer a convincing proof of the rapid advance Russia has already made in the arts of civilization. For a first. attempt it is not so bad, and warrants confident expectation that in the course of time themonetary magnates of the Northern capital will emulate the boldest successes of the -Stock-. Exchanges in London, Paris, and Vienna. Tiie accounts we received of the first day's sab-' scriptions to the new Railway Network Company stated the number of shares subscribed for to have been 103,000; then came the Emperors birthday, and interposed a truce to the struggles of thousands rushing and wrestling for admission to the subscription-offices; end, now that the subscription list is closed and the total number of shares subscribed for is made known, we find that the viCtorious wrestlers who succeeded in getting admission hayesubscribed for nolessthan319,397share'. Deatiny and the interest, of the agio-hunters conspire, however, to deprive them of the just reward due to their esertions; these bold speculators are to have sharesallottcdto them onlypro rat&, and this is to take place as follows. All subscribers of les than 100 will get all they subscribed for; a'l between 100 and 800 will get half of the number subscribed for, and in no case less then 100; awl between 800 and 3,000 wrill get a third of their nlnher, and in no case less then 400; between 3,000 and 6,000 a fourth, and not less than 1,000; 6,000 and upwards a fifth, but not les than 1000. The firat cal of 25 per cent. s payable frora May 15 to June 13, and the scrip that will be issued against these payments will be exchanged for share3 very shortly afterwards. I have no doubt that I shall very shortly have to inform you of some very high amount of premium that the shares are quoted at, for the 2Torthemn Bee, in its ardour for a railway from Nischni Novgorod to the Pacifio (a trifling branch line from the European network, running across the breadth of Asia for about 90 degeees of longitude through a fearfully rocky oountry), has discovered that the Russian capital at present lying dorm3nt ie Asomething very enormous. On occasion of his birthday the Emperor issued a further amnesty, extending his pardon and mercy sall further than that published at the tinw of h -coronation did. The clas pardoned ounthie occa, glon am -1. Those natives of Great Russia, who wore condemned in December, 1849, and have served in the army since with credit to themselves; .,their rank in to be restored to them, but no claim to the restoration of their property Is to be educed from this. 2. Those natives of the Western provinces who were convicted in connexion -with the olish Revolution or for other political offence., and who returned to their homes previous to the Emperor's coronation. 3. Those natives of - the Western Governments who have been convicted of political offences and have sinco then served with credit in the'army. 4. Those natives of the Western (toveraiments who had left their country without permision and had returned thither previous to the coronation are to be reinstated in their hereditary rights. 5. To such of the above as belong to the nobility 'of the privileied classes it shall bs permitted to enter the civil service after conducting themselves well-for three.yeas. 6. Those who have 8erved in the army during their period of banish3int sha lbe admiible at once into the civil service. T. Thoseof theabove whobelongtothe3noble clases have a pace of -two years allowed them to produce the necssary doonmentary evidence of their nobility,-to.be reckconed.from the date of this pub*lication, and, for those who return in oonsequence -of the present uiae, from the day of their return. The following incident is related as having lately taken place somewhere in Rusia ; the circumstance, however, that no date and no place are mentioned, and that the story has been published by the Kilnische Zeitung,, throw great doubt on ita authenticity :-The serfs on an estate, the proprietor, of vwhich:has always been a good master to them, leam one day that their owner ia about to part with the estate to his next neighbour whose overseer was rather notorious for hard treatuient of tne serfs. They accordingly club together and present their master with a very respectable sum of money on condition that he shall not sell the estate; the proprietor accepts the money and ix represented as having sworn to them not to part with it and them. Soon after, however, the neighbour's o'verseer makes his appearance,, and informs the astonished serfs that they no longer belong to 'their former master, but to his employer. The xerfs refuse to acknowledge the latter as their owner, -but at the same time commit no excesses Some parties interested in the matter, however, contrive to get it so represented to the Emperor that he sends off one of his Adjutants to settle the busness; the latter, although informred by the Governor of the province of the true state of the case, requires the aid of the military. With the armed force at his back the Adjutant visitsthe estate that has just changed owners, and, on the serfs venturing to plead their cause before him, proceeds to acts of violence, as-far beyond his authority to commit as they were unjustified by the circunstances of the case. The Governor reports the matter to the Minister of the Interior, the latter to the Emperor; the Emperor orders a strict investigation, and the affair is now broughtbefore the Minister of Justice and ths Senate. As report goes, the Adjutant has boen already brought before a court-martiaL In the absence of any authentic and reliable version of the affair we need not attach great credit to the above details; but we may at least assume that some difficulty has arisen somewhere, out of the relations of a landholder to the " souls" on his estate. In the present state of feeling among the oerfs in Russia, looking forward confidently as they do to being delivered from their thrall before the end of the year (they do not hesitate to say openly that this time next year they shall be free labourer, working for pay), any contretemps like the above requires only violence and rashness to supervene upon it, and we shall have a lamae lit up that will find plenty of combustible materials everywhere throughout the empire to feed the fire. WhiletheEmperor is striving almost night and day to induce reforms throughout the administration and the whole polity of Russia, those who know the country well, the obstinate aversion of the upper classe toany change that shall infringe upon their high standing and power, and, on the other hand, the highly impressionable temperament of the lower classes, and their aspirations for liberty, look on at what is passing in Russia just now with fear and trembling. Sooner or later the moment must come wlhen the Emperor wil find himself under the necessity of refusing something that popular aspirations long for or of interfering reprewively on occasion of some endeavour being made on the part of. the people, or even of a demagogue, to dikcount their future prospects. From that moment the tide of popular feeling, which now bears him upward on the flood of popularity and the nation's love, will turn agst him and ebb towards discontent and rebellion; and already Ihear the Emperor sometimes designated in advance, by careful observers of Russia, as the Pio Nono of the North. SARDINIA. (3]BOX OU OW COB;aBSPONDMT.) TURIN, WAY 13. The " Festa" of the Statuto, just concluded, has been in some respects more brilliant than its predecessors, for which it is indebted chiefly to the relaxation in the passport system in Lombardy and the increased facilities of travel that have allowed the pilgrims of fashion, amusement, or politics to visit this Mecca of thePeninsula(as they call Turin) with greater ease than formerly. It was calculated that there were between 50,000 and 60,000 strangers inTurin on Sunday and Monday, a large proportion of whom were from Lombardy, though of course the great mass was composedlof Piedmontese provinctals; but in the world of fashion the Lombard pilgrimage has this year been most imposing, and, as this is likely to be a growing inovemnint it is one that threatens to create a seriotus rivalry of display between the aristocratic classes of Lombardy and Piedmont not very favourable to the latter. It is not to be expected, therefore, that it will tend to reconcile the ancient nobility of this country to constitutional government, which has already deprived them of many other monopolies and privileges ; while among the lower classes of Turin there is much grumbling at the increased price of provisions on these occasions, which they are taught to confound with the form of government and national suffering, and to make comparisons with the blessed times when the La Margheritas and Latours ruled the land, and the Turinese could enjoy their' festas and other amusements without the intorference of "odious foreigners," who come now to take the bread out of their mouths. I believe it is not only in Piedmont that such like argnments obtain credit with the ignorant and biggoted. The people of Tarin generally are- too well aware of their own interests not to hail all these'symptoms of increasing prosperity with satisfaction, and would, no doubt, be extremely glad if there were three or foiur festast a-year instead of one. A' few days ago the cafkeepers here raised the price of a cup of coffee from three sous to- four on the plea that coffee and sugar had risen greatly in the market lately, and this coup alone must have brought them in very handsome profits when there were 'such crowds of strangers in the town, besides that they are not likely to return to former prices The weather has not been propitious on the whole this time. Sunday morning was tolerably fine for the church service and def/if, but the latter ended in a shower of rain, and both the races the same evening and the iUluminations at night were considerahly marred by heavy. showers. On Monday night, just as the illuminations were commencing, a tremendous thunderstorm, accompanied with hail, burst over the town, and very quickly extinguished the oillampsandgrease pots; but as thiswas the night for the fantastic iUluminatiolis at the expense of the municipality, and as these were principally of gas, the authorities thought it right to persevere with them after the storm, in order not to disap, point the thousands of country people who hid come into town expressly to see them. Yesterday was the second and last day of the races, an1 the weather left nothing to be desired. All the pleasure-seekers now collected in Ttriin were there, as on Sunday, only under more fortunate circum- stances, and therefore better able to enjoy themselve. The King and Royal family we rt both days, and both days his Majestys Usrese tool imp 6omething. The racing 'waa not so good a hat year, but ws enlivened yestercay by a hurdle race, with gentlemen riders, which, a u u dl, ex cited great interest among the friends of the performers, and afforded. much amusement to the public at large. The fence were not of.very forrmidable dimensions but stil they proved sufficient to stop two out of the four competitors iD the race and the gentleman. who was leading by about hIt a distance at the lAt hurdle had the bad luck to roll off at it in front of the Gran stand, and thereby lose all chance of the race, although his hors was evidently the freshest of the lot. Theg accounte from (;euoa and other towns of te Sardinian Slates say' that the SUnivetUsry of the proclamatioRn of the Statuto has been celebrated viith equal enthusidas throughout the kingdom.
IRELAND. (iROX u3 'OWN o O .I)OjDz2.) DUBLIN, SATmDAY MosMma. SADL BXh. Some days Sinoe an applcation was made to the Comnmissioners of Encumbered Estates on behalf of Mr. W. F. Eyre to have his namo placed on the final schedule of encumbranoers, as the owner of a charge of 16,0001. upon the estate of Mr. Matthew Cooke, of Poyntztown, in the county of Kilkenny. The estate was formerly the property of 3Ir. Cooke, but was purchased by the late John Sadleir for the Tand Societ m 1852, together 'with another esxte, for-a sum of 49,2751. The chages in question were orgulally purchawed, previousy to the sle of the esta um GEeneral Smith, by John Sadleir for 14,0001. He sold them to W. Eyre for 16,M and gave him deeds which since, tho disclosure of the proceedings of John Sadleir proved to be forged. The question was whether Mr. Eyre or the L;ind Company were to suffer by the fraud. It was saso stated in the courso of the argument that Mr ThomasJoseph 'Eyre, brotherto r.Willim anc Eyre,hadbeendefraudedf 15,0001. by Saadleirin reference to another property. It was contended onthe part of Mr. Eye that the Land Company should be taken to have -had sufficient notice of his claim through their solicito6r, Messe Morrogh and Kennedy, and through Sadleir himself, who was one of thedirectors -of the company. On the other side it was arguedthat it would be most unjust towa the Land Company to hold that they had notice of -the assignment to Xyre, of which they were totally ignorant, and, of which their solicitor, 1esas, Morrogh and- Kennedy, were also entirely.ignorant, as they had positively swor in their affidweit, and as there was further conclusive evidenoe to show. Yesterday Mr. Conmmissionier HEargreave. gave his judgmnent at great length and after going mlnutely thirough the facts of the case the learned gentleman observed thlat the whole question at issue reduced itself to t his point: "If Sadleit hadbeen minded, 'n the 7th of October, 1852, or any day between thAt time and December, 1854, when the charges W appropriated to purpose of the Land Company, to repslrthe fraud committed onWilliamnFrc |yre, would he have honesly applEed or dirocted Robets to apply these chages for that purpose.; or would such application have been a new frand apins the company, or any breach of trdst or breach of duty toward them? If Mr. WlVliam Francs Eyre had discovered the frud, and had proceeded in equity to compel Sadleir to make it good, a court of equity would have oompelled Sadleir to repair such fraud out or any property that could honestly be appropriated for that purpose, and, in particular, out of Sadeir interest in these ebhares; but it would not have oompelled or even permitted him to make good the fraud out of property that could onl be so anplied by a breach of faith or duty to a thirdperson. Didthe Lind Companyholdthis tostion ?Were these securitie theabsolutepropery of Sadiir, which he oould honetly deal with as aginst tho LAndCompany for any purpoe he imight think right? I have come to the concluEion that any dealing with these charges otherwise than in proViaing the purchae-money of the etaie for which the company ad already paid Sadleir would have been a new fraud upon them-& frauid which Sadleir ought not to be permitted to Perpetrate, even for the purposa of reparinga prevous fraud. Mr. Sadleir ad received from the Land Company the entire purdchasmoney of the esate. It was open to him either to lodge his own purchase-money in oourt, or to purchase charges for which credit could be obtained. He conpleted the purchas partly inthe one moce andc partly in the other; and "under the authority of the Act of Parliament he directed the oommissioners to convey the esate to the trustees of the Laud Compan . tverystp of this was done, as it appear to me, m the dischargof aopure and simple obligation towards the Land Company, which they could insttly have compelled him to do if he had not done it spontaneouiy. am of opinion thatl this transaction enures, as wa in. tended byevery person enaged -in it, for the exclusie benefit of the LandCoinpany-that it ws'done substantalaly by means of money oreredit, ich the payment of 49,0001, of ths compan's money to Sadler abled him to procr; that it wsdone in performance of the contract with the Land Company, and that any other dealing with these charges would have been but a new fraud upon them; and that the only honest and legitimate mode of applying the charges was that which was adopted when the provisional credit was obtained in 1854. There are two circumstances in this transion which tend to confirm this view of the case, but they do not strike me as altogether conclusive. One ofthose is thatin the coorespondenoe between Sadleir and Kennedy, after the sale to tbe Land Company, Sadleir expreses himsaef as relying on the money of the Manchestermen,ashe cItsthem, toputhim In funds to pay General Smith. It must be conceived, however, that this Manchester money did nott to General Smith, bat wu mixed up in the general assets of Sadleir. It even appears that his necessities between August and October had put it out of his powrer to apply this particular money to payment of General Smith, andthat hewas obliged to ohtd a loan from the London and County BankC to pas the money. This circumstance, therefore, bears but alighily on the nature of the transaction. The other circumsace is that the deed of assignment of the 7th of October, 1852,was m otoThomas Roberts, who i, in fact, though not so sated, a member of the Lend Company; nd *am called upon to infer that in thisdeedhewastheirtrustee. Onthispointlcanonlysay that Iam not able, ontheevidenoebefore me, tosatisfy myself whether Sadleir, in introducing his name, did it for the purTpse of creating a trast for the company, or whether RobertsWs name was merely introduced just as that of any other fiend or connexion of Mr. Sadleir might have been. it is, perhaps, but justice towards the memory of Mr. Ssdleir to add that he appears to have done all he could to fulfil his contract with the Land Conmany, and that from time to time he paid for and purchased up other charges, to the benefit of which the company are undoubtedly entitled. Ihave ouly now to advert to another circumstance, which has been relied upon as adverse to the view that this asaignment was made in pursance of an obligation towards the Land Company-viz., that when the provisional credit was applied for and obtained it was based upon Mr. Kennedy's atflidavit, to the effect that the charges were vested In Mr Sadleir, and that the money seenred by them was due to him. I am of opinion that, under the circumstances, this Is not a governing or leading incident of the case. [rEaving mado some furthor observations on this portion of the case, tbse srned Conmmissioner proceodod to sayl-I rnle this caso on the -rounds-fist, that the beneficial interest which Ur. S&ellr poswtsed in these charges, quite indepen delnl of the Land Compiay, and beforo they even existed, ist aicted by a constructed equity in favnur of William Francis Eyro, tnd that tho aqsignuent of the 7th of October, 1852, though ml!ade with tho privity and under the directions of John Sadleir, cannot dcefat this equity, inasmuch asthe companv had through their aWits notice of an allegedtitle of Williau Francis Eyre, which was to their knowledge recognized by, and therefore valid against, John Sadleir ; and, secondly, that the equity of W. Francis Eyre never existed against that portion of the beneficial interest in the charges which was acquired exclusively by tho assignment of Oct 7, 1852, inasmuch as that acquisition was either not made by Sadleir at all, or, if made by hin, was acquired with the intention of performing his contract with thee Land Company, who virtually suppUed the means of procning the assignment, and was acquied, in short,under circumstances*wich would have precluded Mr. William Francis Eyre from attaching his eqauity on that acquisition, seeing that it could not be honestly dealt with except for the benefit of the Lend Company. My rule will be-declare that the beneficial interests in the charges numbered on the draught schedule 3, 4, 6, and from 20 to 26. both inclmsive, iUvested in the Irish Land Company, or their trustees, to the extent of 14.84017, being the consideration for the assignment of the 7th of October, 1852; and that the residue of the sum due on foot of these charges is affected with a trust in favour of W.. Francis Eyre existing prior to said assign: ment, and of which trust the Land Company are to be deemed to hive had-notice. Deolare the company entitled to have credit against John Sadleir's purchase money, and the interest theron, for said sum of 14,8407., with interest thereon at 5 per cent. from the 7th of October, 1852, to the 16th of December, 1854, or at their option to apply said credit of 14,8407., as if made on the 7th of October, 1852 and let them lodgo the residue of the purchase money witbin two months-each party to bear his own costs of objectiona" ITUE.SOAL REVOLLtON. The county of Iouth, but a few years since the hotbed and head-quarters of the Riband conspiracy a;nd the scene of many sickening murders, will hardly be recognized in the following sketch of its present condition, supplied by a local paper .- "Two of the great receiving houses of human misery and crime in our county are new, comparatively spea}ing, but very thinly populated.

Iin1800 the consumption of spirits was 11,991,501 gallons, and this century it has never been less than 1^800 846 gallons (in 1801). The largest conrumpti. n. was 31,362,- gallons, in the year 1836. Tuglanmd, last year. took in for conusmption, 13,964,284 gallon, Scotland 7,402,643 gallons, andlieland 6,936,938 gallons.

There wer also 3,423,406 gallos of coloonial spirits charged with a duty of 1,3o88,891. The total quantity of malt charged duty in the whole of the united kingdom last year was 6,980,040 bushels (duty 6,572.237.).

SHE 2TEtuRe oF EBLLOwUr7PS, TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. SL-,- w statutes are noer in the course of prepartion by alacst every college in Cambridge. Some reforms will' be prope:ed on the part of the fellows themselves, and tho Conairajon lwill perhaps exercise their compulsorv power Dn the appointment of professors-n favourite hobby with university reformers,-and thus, as has been the casa at Oxferd, minor alteratlons will satisfy the clamour for improve. ment, and tho question of the tenure of fellowships Will pass unloticAd,-probably because it is the subject of fundac mental importance, and aso becaue a change would involve ac2 fw Administrative difficulties, A prohibition upon marriage is Eo antagonistic to thle I ,plrit of tho ago that it is incumbent upon those who advo. eato the presont mode of vacating fellowships to show that it is accompanid with intrinsio advantage. Uany men of cminenco and position in each university maintain an opposite opinion; and you will therefore, per. kap2, insert these remarks to explain the reaons which havo induced tho following conclusions - L That tho prevent syntom is highly injurion to the fellows thenselvea. 2. That it causes an unjust and pornicious distribution of Mhe church patronage of the colleges. 3. That it eeriously detracts from the efficiency of the univ.rsity. A sufficient numbor of vacancies in fellowships is of sach Importance that a removal of the restriction of celibacy mus be accompanied with a limitation in the term of tenure. Tho time which would be faxed would probably vary from 10 to 14 year The mota powerful rarguments for the cbange, perhaps arlso from the neceassity of this limitation in the time. A lay fellowship is now regarded as affording the means to commenc3 a profession. The prospect that an incoie wil at a fixed timo expire, which has enabled a certain position in life to be maintained, would prompt to im. mediate exertion, and, supported by tho talents which may be assmed from such a distinction, a competency *euld bo secured which would enable tho fellowship to be vacated at the time of expiration without saerious inconve. nience. Now, however, no necessity is felt for immediate exertion. A man will pass the four or five years after his degree without settling to any definite occupation. The continuous labour which a profession requires becomes neduous to him; success seems distant; his life is one of comparativo luxury. At length he reconciles himself to zemain a bachelor; his fellowship is retained to thg injury of his college, and the Cambridge and Oxford cZendars show how often a man of talent is thus sacrifed. The restriction presses wlth great injustice upon those clerical fellows who are anxious to leave the university to engage in pachial duties. In no position of life is the want of a home so especially felt; and itIs a truism to aw-ert that there aro in every parish most important daties for a clergyman's wife to perform, which without her vwill be neglected. In this case, also, there would arise a most important advantage from the limitation in the term of tenure, because a man would, after the vacation of his £ellowship, still remain in his rota for colege preferment, dma thus would cease the present anomaly, that the most certain method to obtain a college living is not to perform active miniaterial duties, but to enjoy the comfort of a college life. But the evil does not cease here; parishes are dictimized by having forced upon them these men, whose babits have tended to render them totally unfit for their daty. The evidence given before the Commission is conelEsive as to the fact that the best men are not retained ia the university, and the reason is self-evident. No man engaged .a a, tutor can regard it as a settled profession. Cambridge los mean who would be invaluable to her; they refuse to start upon a career which they must at once relinquish and begin life again if at any time they wish to marry. Those who remain as college tutors are placed in a position in which they can seldom do justice to themselvos. Often the: office is taken, not from any love of its duties, but as a temporary employment, in which the emoluments are ample; and when this is not the case it may be asserted as a general fact that it can never be expected that a man placed in such an unsettled position can discharge its duties with adequate zeal and devotion. This points to an explanation of a fact of most significant Importance-that the whole of the education imparted in our universities is derived from private tutors; and by edueation I mean notmerely instruction, but also the train. ing of the mind. Permit me to state my own case, and it is the case of every one with whom I have conversed upon tho subject. Throughout my univeraity course I rested entirely upon my private tutor; from him alone I received instruction, and by him alone was any effort made to educate my mind. Gifted with talents of the highest order, he has dovoted his life to his occupation; his pupils at once in. stinctively feel this; a mutual confidence is inspired, and this is the secret of his eminent success Resting solely upon his guidance, I was unconcerned with my college tutors except when they enforced certain formal rules of discipline. The difficulties of detail consequent upon the change will be at once by some magnified into insuperable objec. tions; there is one which is always brought into particular prominence,-that married tutors would reside in the college. The masters have establishments within the 0-lIege, and I have never yet heard that any inconvenience lan been experienced from their residence. Cambridge is, at any rate, moat unfortuanately deficient in female soiety, and I can only say that in tho single case in which I have known the wife of the head of a college condescend to take some slght interest in the undergraduates that a most bone. ficial inflaence has been produced, and that the advantage has been recognized throughout the university. If it is supposed that tutors when married would have their attention more divided, it is surely only necessary to consider the contrast which the public schools afford, and observe the zeal with which mazrrcd masters there perform their duties. I have troubled you with these remarks, since the importance of the question renders it worthy of discussion; permit me, in conlusion, to assure yon that I am no' rpecial-pleading for myself-" preseat interests are not to be interfered with "-and I have the good fortune to be able to subscribe myself, A FELLOW OS M 'COLLEGE.

SHIPS i BOA TgS. TO THE EDITOR) OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In the notices of motions for last night's debate In the House of Commons I observe that Colonel Sykes proposed to ask, " Whether the ships in Her Majesty's navy were supplied with Mr. Clifford's apparatus for lowering boats Iwhile tho vessel was at full speed,' and also whether, in the event of the Mercantile Marine Act being altered, ships were compulsorily to be supplied with the same in. vention." Mlay I ask through the medium of your widely oirculated columns how we poor sailors are to manage if in the course of our cruise we are brought up by a reef or shoal and are only fitted with the means of lowering our boats at full speed, Mr. Clifford's plan providing only for the latter contingency? Of what avail would the apparatus have been to the ill-fated crew of the Avenger, or to our devoted troops in the Europa and Blrkenhiead, or, indeed, to 99 out of 100 casualties that we have read of? -- I am, Sir, Your obedient servanti A POST OAPTAfl. £may i0.
ARTsTS' BENEVOLUNT FUN.- On Saturday evening the 30th anniversary festival of this admirable fund took plce at the Freemasons' Tavern. Mr. Godwit presided, and there were also present among the guests Sir Charles Eastlake, F.R. A.; Sir W. Ross, I.A.; ;>. Roberts, ILA.; E. M. Ward, R.A.; J. T. Willmore, A.R.A. ; J. R.Foley, A.B.A. ; Mr. J. Dickenson, F.R.S., with other artists and admirers of art. Theusual complimentary toastshaving been given with much spirit, and duly honoured, the chairman Xszve the toast of the evening, and referring to the greatly increased patronage which the publc of late had bestowed unon works of art, stated that at the private view of the two wVater Colour Soaeties purchases were eagerly made among the works exhibited to the amount of 3,0001., and at the private exhibition of the Royal Academy to the extent of ,0001. He fnuly believedthat the total amount of purchases effected during the presenit season at the various exhibitions would not fall short of 30,0004 This was a most gratifying proof of the estimation which the piublic had of the artistes labours. Stillit was incumbent upon them to provide among themselves a fund which should be available for them in theeventof thosesudden visitationsandmisfortunes which fellupon artists, as npon other men, often when in the height of their prosperity. The toast was drunk with en thusialsr, and a substantial proof of its cordial reception was found in the subscriptions announced during the course of the evening, wzhich amounted to 5001. This was a larger sum than had been subscribed at any previous anniversary, and included the 18th donation from Ber Ma. jesty of lC01. Other toasts complimentar7 to the officers of the fund and the Royal Academy were drunk with great applanse during the cour8e of the evening. The dinner was served in the usual excellent style of the Preeraasons' Tavern; and Mr. Banks, jun., was an effective toastmaster.

CENTBAL CRIMINAL COURT, Hay 16. OLD COURT. (Befrs a RECORDER.) THE QUEEN ON THE PROSEOUTION OF THE NORTH LONDON RAILWAY 'V. WILLIM BAY, JOHN SWEETLOVE, AND SAMUEL WIlON. The abovenamed defendants surrendered to take their tdal upon an indiotment which charged them with holding Mr. Bodkin and Mr. Poland were counsel forthe prosecution; Mr. metcalfe aapperd for Wilson, Mr. Sleigh for Sweetlove, and Mr. Gfrd represented Ray Mr. BODz>s said that the only object of the prosecutors in preferring the present indictment was to put a. Btop to a proceeding that had proved a reat sourc of annoyance and inconvenience, and, as the defendants had consented to plead " Guilty" and undertook that the nuisance should not be repeated, it would he unnecessary to 8o any further into the matter. The company, it appeared, had leta flield belonging to them in Maiden-lane, near to the Teow Cattle. market, to the defendant Ray for grazing cattle, and with the expresa understanding that it should never be used for purposes of this sort; butt contrasy to the agreement, it' appeared that a fair was helduponthefield, whichcontinued several days, and a great number of idle and disreputable persons congregated together, very much to the annoyance of the inhabitants; and it was to put a stop to such prooeed. ings that the present indictment had been preferred. The company wou d, however, be satisfied with the defendants entering into their oswn recognizances to appear and receive judgment if they should be called upon to do so; but of course, if the offencewere not repeated, they would hear no more about the maatter. The COuNSl, for the defendants said that they were not aware they had been acting illegally, and as the only object appeared to be to prevent a similar prooeeding from taking place in future, they were willing to consent to the terms sugested by the prosecution. The defendants then pleaded " Guilty," and entered into apersonalreccgnizance n te sam of 1001. to appear and receive the judgment of the Court if they should e called upon to do so. William Day and James Devo were charged with stealing a cruet-stand, some silver spoons, and other articles, the property of Henry Green. Mr. Sleigh, Mr. Ribton, and Mr. Sharpe conducted the prosecution; Mr. Robinson and Mr. Metodafe were counsel for the prisoners. This case occupied the Court for several hounrs, but the facts lay in a very narroxv compass The prosecutor is the eminent shipbuilder, and the robbery m question was committed at his private residence at Walthamatow, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon of the 24th of April. At the time in question a man carrying a carpenter's basket was seen to go out of the hail door, at the same time taking his hat off very reipectUully, and apparently speaking to some one inside the house, which had the effect of dis. arming suspicion. This man got into a cart, in which there was another man, waiting outside, and they drove off at a fast pace. The most positive evidence was given on the part of the prosecution that Day was the man who came out of the house in the manner stated, and thatDevo was the man who was in the cart outside, and it appeared that both the prisonen were taken into custody at a publichouse at Stepney, and were at once identified. For the defence an alibi was set up, and from the evidence of a number of respectable witnesmes it appeared to be pretty clearly made out that the witnes3es for the prosecution must have been mitaken as to the identity of the prrisoners. The jury returned a verdict of l7et Guilly. The tirial of Robert Robinson Tripp for the murder at slington wzas postponed to the next session, as was also the case of Clark and Bnsh for the abduotion of a young NIEW COURT. (Beilore theCoasoN SRnEANT.) Flora Bantmg 21, spinster, and Elizabeth Willson, 23, married, were indlcted for endeavouring to obtain from James Shoolbred and others certain goods. Mr. Metcalfe prosecuted. The facts of the case were these :-upon the 3d of April theprosecutors, who are the drapers of Tottenham-court. road, received a note, purorting to come from the Marchioness of Salisbury, deuringthat a quantity of goods of a valuable description, which the letter particularized, should be sent to the station of the GreatNorthern ailwa to be forwarded toHatfield-hous The letter not being In its character such as it was probable would come under. such circUmstances the prosecutor's suspicions were aroused, andafictitiousparcelbeingmadeupandsentto thestation, a constable was set upon the watch. After the parcel had been a short time at the booking offioe a lad came up and took it away, paying the booking fee. He took it round to the "up" platform of the railway, 'where Banting was waiting, she haning Just previously sent the lad for it. Upon the officer questioning her s;he said it was "al1 right " that she was the Marchioness of Salisbury'slady's-maid. At this moment Wilson camne up, and said it was true that they were both her ladyship's servants. The officer, however, intimated that he should not part with them, upon which they became veryviolent, and were with some trouble taken to the station. Upon an inquiry being made it turned out that both prisoners lodged together, and had been fellow, servants with Lady Castleton m Ireland. Banting pleaded " Guilty," and the jury, having con. vioted Willson, they Were Eentenced to six months' imprisonment. TEIRD COURT. (Bcfos- Mr. PRENDERGAST, QCO.) Thomas Williams, alias Ricbard Bnrns, and Thomas Buns, were indicted for forging a receipt with intent to defraud. Mr. Robinson andl Mr. ff. J. O'Connell prosecuted; 3fr. Payne and Mr. Ribton defended. Previously to the case being caUed on, Mr. RIBTON applied for te postponement of it until the next session, upon the ground that the brief had not long been delivered to him, andthat being caled upon to attend at the Middlesex Sessons he had not been able to devote that time to the defence he could have wished. He believed that in the remarkshe ewas about to make every other member of the bar would concur. The greatest public inconvenience arose from the Middlesex Sessions being fixed for the same week as the Central Criminal Court. He was glad to findthat many of the aldermen were now magistrates for the county, and he hoped they would take care that such an arrangement should in future be avoided. It wasa practice which couldnot be too highly censured, the more so as there was every reason to suspect that by it public interests had been sacrificed to private interests. The case was, after some remarks from the Court, pro. ceeded with, and from the evidence it appeared that the prisoners are brothers, and their right name is Burns. Tne prisoner Thomas was up to December last a detective oficer of the S division of police. The prosecutor is a young man living in Milton-street, Finabury, and upon the 12th of February he saw in the oroming Adlverse,rtho following advertisementa : "Wanted, a respetable young man,oto rolect for an offlo. N,o praviou, knowledge of duties required. alsiM'. 1i -week; hoors, leto. This being a plae of trust nobone need apply ho cannot give a cash aecurity ot LW0 returnable on leawIng. Apply by letter, with real name and addreou23, Bell-yard, Temple-bar." The,proseautor, 'whose name is Edmunds, and who described himaself asarent collector, wrote.andwas referredtoNo.20, a letter, signed by Williams, being sent to mnake the appoint. ment. Upon arriving there htesaw Williams, 'who said his aname was Browvn, that Williams was not at home, buLt that he could give bhn all the necessry particulars about the situation, which was to collect debts and rents, and, as a good deal ef money would pass through his (prosecuter's} hands, the security was neces ary. The prosecutor said he would think tho matter over. He called again upon the 6th of March, and saw Williams, who again said that Williamr- was not in, but that he would go out and fetch him. He -went ou,t and, returning with the prisoner Burns, sadc, "This is Mr. Williams." .After some conversation rosecutor gave 61. as part of the 10X. security, for which urns gave him, in the preserce of Willims, a receipt, ngged "Williams," and ask,d the prosecutor if he could at once enter upon his duties; but he said he could not until Monday. He went, and was then sent todeliver some letters, Upon the following day being similarly employed he spoke to the prisoners about it, and they, said the situation was not vacant until the followingMonday, They then sent him unon several fictitious errands, upon 'which he refused to g5 any more, and aslked for his money back. This they said they could not give him, as it was at their bankers in I'eicester-square. The other evidence proved that the prisoners had no account at the bankers, and that the place in Judd-street was an office for the registryof servants, but to all appearances only opened for purpoEes of fraud like this. The jury found them both Guilty. Mr. Robinsons id, Williams had been before convicted of a similar offence, and there were numerous other charges where they had got different sums of money from poor persons seeking for situations, who had given it as part of the deposit money. The learned Comi osIER said, the offence was a very cruel one, leading to the most painful resulL Poor creatures seeking honest employment had, when disappointed, been driven to commit suicide.

Mr. Metcalfe appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Wordey for the prisoner. The case appeared to excite a good deAl of interest, the oner having until recently been a Lieutenant in tho lyal Art , Rwith which corps he servod in the Crimean campaign.a.!was the son of olonel Iloyd, who died of cholera while on a mission to the seat of war.

He believed, of course, that it ws3 all right as he k3new the prisoner as an artillery officer, and had sold him goods before he went to the Crinimea He did not know his mother or father, but he understood that his father died in the Crimea, and his mother died recently. He never gave him credit before this transaction. He punctually ai for whit he had before he went out to the war. He ha not paid for the portmanteaa and rug. Mr. Roberit, bootmaker, 9, New Bond-street, said the prisoner came into his shop and tried on a pair -of boots He went way with them uponhis feet, ad desired that the old pair miht be went to his lodgings, giving an address, on the followmng morning, and he would then pay for the new ones. The prioe was 11. 5% The old boots were accordingly sent on the following morning, but no such person as the prisoner ws known at the address given. About t4-o months afterwards he came agin and said, " Mx. Roberts, I owe you some money." Witness did not recognize him, but he soon made himself known, and said he was going to a party and selected a pair of boots to go in as he said He nad, Lesideq, other boots, and the whole came to 41. 7s., for which surm he gave him a check, asking that it niight not be presented for a few days. Witness said hie would keep it back if it was his particular wish. Theprione lokedat him and said, " I don't sup Is euthink=i would give you a check that would not be pad" Hereferred to the A It, and found his name as a ieutenantintheArtillery, and so farhe wa satisfied. The check was dishonoe Mr. Marsh, perfumer, of 175, Piccadilly, shted that the prisoner had been a customer of hi. One day ho came into the shop and said he had borrowed a sovereign of the sbop. woman, and if he would give him the difference he wro id give him a check for 54 He had not got four sovereigns, Dut gave him a 54. note, and the prisoner said he was going somewhere and would change the note and bring the so01reign. Hegave witness a 51 check, which was paid into bns banker's, but it wa returned, as there were no effects. He knew the prioner's name by finding it in his books. He owed him a debt before he went to the Crimea. He did not ask him not to present the checkl. Mr. Wlson bootmaker, of 25, Jermynystreet, stated thbat the prisoner 6ad beeu a customer of his ince Janary, 1K In January last he applied to him for his account, when he informed him that he could not pay it then, but would accet bill for the amount, 221 2s., if he would draw uponhim at two months, the bil to be payable at Cox and Greenwood's. Accordingly, he drew the bill, aid the prisoner accepted it. The prisoner then asked him to cash him a check for 51., as it was post banding hours. *e said he would, and gave him, five sovereigns, and received from him a checic for Si. On the following day he sent tfe check to Cox and Greenwood's, but it was returned, there being no effects. Of course, he only gave him the fivesovereigns upon the faith of the cbeck. in crosa-examination he said he ad cashecd checks for the prisoner before, and they were duly honoured. The prisoner never told him that he received his pay from Cox end Greenwood, and thatthat was the reason he drew upon them. The day after he cashed the check the prisoxler called, but he was not at home. John Waring, 33 C, took the prisoner into custody. 1e found utpo,n him the 54 check which Mr. Bengough ha7d te~ Mfr. Woollacott., clerk to Msr.Cox and Greenwood, deposed, that he had the superintendence of the accoonts"^f artilery officers. The prisoner had been an of ficer in that branch of the service, but was not now. He hid ceased to be so since this charge had been preferred against him. Ee had been removed from the army. His pay wsra suspended in December last. Witness gave him notice that it ws stopped. He called, and then shefact was verbally commusiicated to him. No pay had accrued to his account since the 1st cf Decemboer. Therewas at that time, December abaLance of some few pounds due tohim. Some sums ba been lodged to his account by his soother, but not wvithi [ nine months, p'obably. There had been nothing to his ac- count since Deccember, and witness desired him not to draw upon the firm. Cross-examined.-The prisoner was suspended, but sometimes a supension was3 taken off and the back pay would then became due. The prisoner was suspended for being absent writhout leave. The prisoner served with his corps at the siege of Sebastopol, and ha the mned'aL. He could only receive his pay through their house in lLondon, in the Crimea he had it through their agent there. HIe had been allowed to overdrawr his account, officers occasionally did so, and a little liberality wans howvn to offcers in that re* spect. The prisonier's father died of cholera in the Crimea and his mother died ashort time since. [The prisoner here seemed much affeed,1 The firm, of course, wrould not permit' a suspended officer to overdraw. The prisoner's account was still open, and moneg wrould be received and placed to his credit if offered. If money had been lodged on his account, of course these checks would have been paid as far as i' went. This was the ease for the prosecution, and some discusn in took place asto whether in point of la there ws any casoeto go to the jury. Iltlmately, The AS5ISTAI.-TJUDGn said he should withdrawv all the charges rom the juryvexcept that of Mr. Wilson . Upon tbat he must take their opinion. ba. Wobseioy then addressed the jury, and besought them to give the casethe most serious consideration eze they branded the prisoner, a brave and gallant soldier w ho had hitherto moved in superior circles of hsciety, and had been esteermd and loved by friends and relatives oie high position and chaacter, with infamr and disgrace for ever, forif founud guilty on this charge he could bo regarded as Little less than a common thief and swindle The learned counsel dwelt with a good deal of fseling upon his client's services in the trenches beforc Sebastopol, and the sfortune that had befallen him in the death of his father -a gallant officer, who had held several important postions under the Government with gre t honour, and who fellX vsctimtosilentiadisease w hleperforminga*dutyspecinlly intrustesetohim in the Crimea, and of his mother, eho had rendered him pecuniary aid then he needed it, by placing money to his credit at the agent He contended that itwas quteconsistentwith the prisoner's conduct and the state of his CCoUDt at Cao and Greenwood's that he gave these checks as recurity for ultimate payment, and not with the intention of deraudinr th prosecutors of their money, as he had reason to thin that money would be placed thnis credit by mcmbers of his family, and if his suspension had been t en off his back pay s old have been *vailable to meet these demands. It appeared from the evidence tbat checks which he had got cashed on previous occasions had been duly set, and it was impossible, he submitted, that the intention of actual fraud could be imputed to dim, as in thcCase of a man who drew checks npon a bank where he had no account _t all, for the prisoner still had an open account at CAx and Greenwood's Having called attention to the utter rumn which a verdict of guilty must bring upon the prisoner, who was just upon the dawn of manhood, and whose life had begun withi every hopeful prospect, the learne couns appealed to the jury to return an verdict of nthe guilty.oot eioscosaeaio r The AS=rthesrvJ ison then summed and and lIft it to the jury to say rhether, in te case of irc Wilson, the pisoner had reldly the intention of swindling him out of his money If the prisoner had given the check knowing that his account was overdrawn, but having reason to erpect that money might be lodged to hisfaoct bwhich the check would be met, e arig in mind that he had an open account at the agens, he was entitled to an acquittaL. The jury, after a few moments consultation, found the pitsoner Nsot puoity.y I The ASSImriteC-Ju im, addressing the prisoner, said upon the evidence he had been propnely acquitted, bub he thought it right to say that his onduct had been such as merited the severestreprobation. It was impossible to hope that the militae r authorities would rainstate him in his position in the army, and ho' would therefore earnestly advise him to get his friends together to render him help to leave England, so that he might sever himself from that course of, life in London which it was too evident he had plunged into within the laat few months, and by anew career abroad wipe from his name the stain he had brought upon it. If, on the other hand, he returned to his former practices, and should happen to bring himself within the rtach of the law, so that a jury would convict him, he might rely upon it his punishment would be one of the utmost severity, The prisoner bowed politely and quitted the deck. Martin Burke, 27, was indicted for stealing a purse and 4s. from the person of Henry Henderson. The prosecntor, a Jew, saidhe lived at 6, Wellclose-square, and was an ivory turner. On the night of the 4th of April he was at the door of the Strand Theatre speaking to some one, and he had just taken his purse from his pocket, in wbich there were 4s., and as he held it in his band the prisoner came up to him,seired him by the collar,and saying he was a detective officer dragged him some yards, and -then snatched the purse from him and pamssed it over to another man. Hethen laid hold of bim end held him until a policoman came up, and then gave him in charge. On making his apparance in the witnees-box the prose. cutor was recognized by three officers as a person who had been several times in prison-the Lst time not very long ago -for various offences and in different names. He was said to be a hawker of tokens, or imitation sovereigns. The proeecutor denied this, and said it was his brother, whO was so imuch like him that they often p usd for one another; but the offlicers wcre positive that he was the mnan. The defence was that theprosecutor and other personslad been inthe habit of pongresgating about the entrance of the Strand Theatre selling tickets and checks for admission. The prisoner.who, was emnployed at the theatre, wa3 directed to disers them, and prevent their pursuing such trfie, pan on int.forizusWit the proseutor he gave blIP a blow Ii in the eye and ehargea him with haying stolen lip 'whIch Was an utter c"od.

The man then attacked him with his umbrells, which he broke over his heal Proee. cutor then seized the man, and heid both prisoners til a constable came up. The latter part of this staement was fully confirmed by the constable, who saw the attack that was rDade upon the prosecutor. The female prisoner said the prosecutor was drunk and wanted to take liberties with her. She asewrted that she had not taken the purse, and the prosecutor would, no doubt, find it in his pocket.

The prosecutor denied that he was in the slightest degree intoxicated' The male prioner said he knew nothing of the woman, and had only interfered to protect her.

The Orinoco experienced on the homeward voyage light easterly winds till the 8th of May, north and north-westerly *vinds till the 13th, southerly breezes till her arrival in the Channel, and in the Channel light airs and calms. Our dates from Jamaica are to the 27th ult. inclusive, being the day on which the steamer left. There is no news of any importance whatever. The chief topic in the papers is the capture of the slaveship byHer Majesty s brig Arab, off the coast of Cuba, of which intelligence has already been received in England by way of America. The island generally was healthy. The head-quartprs of the 3d West India Regiment embarked on the 22d ult. in Her Majesty's transport steamer Perseverance, for Demerara. From De Cordova's Mercantile Intelligencer of the 25th we learn that coffee was getting scarce and bringing 43s. to 44s. for ordinary. Sugar was worth 23s. to 26s. according to quality. The stock of corn Twas light, and but little doing; 43s. per bushel had been realized for lots for some time past. Of flour some late parcels had been sold at 37s. 6d. to 38s. Alewives continued at 24a. Late parcels of American butter sold at Is. Two recent cargoes of codfish had been sold at 18s. tierces and 20s. boxes, but the last was held for advancea rates. Herrings were plentiful and only commanded 24s. per barrel. HRams atundant, and little demand; last sales at 9d. There were no arrivals of pork; mess of which the stock 'was very small, was held at 128s. ; late sales at 102s. for prime mess. A cargo of rice from Barbadoes at auction realized l1s. 6d. for yellow, and 13s. 6d. for white. Of pimento there was none at market. Rum was worth 3s. 5d. to 3s. 6d. per gallon, proof 18. Soap was dull, with large stock in the hands of dealers. Tongues were in scanty supply; a parcel of very superior Ameri'can sold at 60s. Exchanges on London :-Jamaica and Colonial Banks, 90 days, 4 per cent. premium; -S0 days, one per cent. premium; 30 days, 1 per cent. premium - private bills at par. On iNew York merchants bills 14 per cent. premium. At Demerara the vacancies in the Court of Policy occasioned by the resignation of the Hons. Dr. Havey and A. D. V. Gon Netacher had been filled iip by the election of Messrs. D. Macdonald and J. E. Roney. The new Militia Bill was read a second time on the 20th ult. by a majority of -one, after a vigorous and strong opposition. The Chief-Justice had moved for a return of all the male Portuguese between the ages of 16 and B0 resident in Georgetown, with the view of introducing certain resolutions urging upon Her Majesty's Government the propriety of getting the clause in the treaty between England and Portugal rescinded which exempts Portuguese from military duties in a British colony.. The weather during the fortnight previous to date of advicea had continued dry and warm. The young canes were thriving, and there was every prospect of a fair crop. The exports during the fortnight had amounted to-sugar, 2,730 hhds., 209 tres., 242 brls., 400 bags; runa, 1,327 puns., 351 hhds., 33 brls.; molasses, 204 puns.; 'offee, 3 brls.; cocoanuts, 53,432; timber, 12,255 ,cubic feet; lancewood spars, 164; hides, 508; horns, 2,196; flour, 331 brls.; rice, 4,425 bags; pork, 70 brls. ; gin, 100 cases, 50 demijohns; chain ,cables, 3; anchors, 4. Trade was stiU dull among the merchants. Freights were scarce. At Barbadoes a new road Bill, unaltered from the one recently thrown out bythe Council, was brought in and passed by the Assembly on the 21st ult. The health of the island continued good, and trade in some branches was brisk. There had been a great many arrivals lately, and, the market being overstocked with breadstuffs, inactivity and depressed prices were the result. The w ind bad been favour. able for crop operations, wfhich proceeded slowly. t3ome few estates, principally in St. Michael'a~ parish, had finished, but the crop was on the whole backward, nor was it likely to be equal to last year's. The export of sugar to the 27th amounted to 11,2500 hhds., 584 tierces, 2,077 barrels ; Molasses, 2,181 puns., 37 hhids., 50 brls.; rum 31 puns.; cotton 11 bales ; aloes 18 gourds,-not more, so far as sugar is concermed, than half of the quantity shipped at the same time last year. PopuLar demonstrations wvere being made in (Irenada against the charcoal tax, and other obnoxious measures of taxation recently initiated by the Executive Council, and carried through the influence of its members in the House of Assembly. The weather w7as still favourable for the work of sugar mzanufacture throughout the island, and unabated activity prevailed on the plantations. As the season ad- vanced the yield of the cane was found progressivelyI to improve, and things in general bore a more en'couraging aspect than for some time previous. MIany estates would, it was anticipated, double the quantity made last year, and the quality of the ,sugar produced was unexceptionable. It was considered pretty certain that the total crop of the colony would exceed that of last year by at least one-half. The cocoa trade continued bris and producers were obtaining on the spot 60s. to 52s. per owvt. About 6461b. of nutmegs, of a superior quality, had been recently shipped to Europe, and the trees were generally in a flourishing state, The market was abundantly supplied with provisions and general merchandise, and prices were descending. F5lour was tariffed at 40s. the barrel. FRrom Port of Spain (Trinidad) our advices extend to the 23d ult. A despateh was forwrarded on the 16th from Go0vernor lKeats to Archbishop Spacca-. pietra, stating that Her Majesty's Government had ceonsented to his receiving full salary from the period of his recognition, only requiring of him the taking of the oath of allegiance to the Supremne HIead of the State. A slight shock of earthquake* was felt on Sunday morning, the l9th ult., about 10 minutes to 9 o'clock. Produce was coming down largely and rapidly to the wharfs and nianye n.mpweebslenaetaign ,quays, and ships wlere- busily engaaed taking la cargoes. The yearly report of the Agent-General ,Of Immigrants had just been published, and the coindition and order of the immigrant labour in this Colony was represented in it in a very favourable aspect. From the tabular returns accompanying the report we learn thAt the immigrant population on the 31st December, 1856, was 6,683, since increased by the arrivals of 849 adult3 and 101 children. Of the number there at the b-ginning of the year 3,484 coolies were under the first indenture for five years; 334, having completed their first five years, had accepted the $50 bounty, and indented for another like period ; 596 had taken the $10 bounty and entered upon a year's indenture; 720 had taken out certificates of industrial residence; 657 were Chinese and 892 children. The deaths of cooles during tho year were 110, and the births 45. In 18o6 the number who returned to India was 280, and the total of arrivals was 566 adults and 61 non-adults. The Agent-General closes his report with the note that upwards of 100 of the Chinese iunder indenture have applied to puirchase the gredemption of their remaining year of induistrial residence, and that there is every re.ason to believe that on any future importation of these people srnore than two-thirds of the number would pay up their l-identures at the expiry of the third year. A careful a:zd searching examination had been imade into the cau3es of the mortality on board this year's imrmigrant ve;V.le the results of which had not been, pubished ;'Jut it was believed that they t11- tqEqtq .° «49,f i4g 9thCFqtg!t, wAil y wsn to the atatein which they were embarked, aided by the change in diet.

TEE NAPIERBS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The insertion in your widely circulated journal of the accompanying copy of a letter which I have addressed to Lieutenant-General Sir W. Napier, and for which I have received his acknowledgment, will oblige Your most obedient servant. R. B. WOOD. f.Aln" nl .uoyal kiospita, IJablin, May 15. "Royal Hospital, Dablin, May 7. "Sir,--As the lAte Sir Charles Napier in so-eral passages of his journal, whioh you have lately published, aclnowledges that he always received sapport and kindness from the late Lord Hardinge, I cannot but tbink that Sir Oharles was not sufficiently acquainted 'with the details of the Sutlej campaign when he wrote that part of his journal which imputes blame to the Governor-General of fndia for not having made due preparation to meet the contingency of a war with the Sikhs in 1845. " The Sikh army commenced crossing the Satlej on the 13th of December, i845. The Sikh Sirdars made their submisson to the Governor-General on the 18th of February, 1846. During these 66 days an army was assembled which comprised nine out of the 11 regiments of European infantry which at that time were stAtioned within tho Bengal Presidency, also the three regiments of European cavalry, and almosb every troop of Horse Artillery and field battery of the Bengal army. This army advanced uowards of 200 miles, it crowsed a large river on boats* which had been built at Bombay, it was accompanied by a siege train composed of 36 siege g-ans, with 1,000rounds of ammunition for each gun, and a large engineer park. 'This army fought four general actions, and dictated peace under the walls of the enemy's capital. It may also. be observed that the British force engaged at Ferozeshah on the 21st of December, 1845, only eight days after the enemy commenced crossing the Sutlej, was larger than that which was brought into the field a' Sobraon on the 10th of February, 1846. How could such operations have been effected in 66 days if due prepa ration had not been made ? Sir Charles Napier appears to have been misinformed on the following points:-The force stationed at Ferozepore under Sir John Littler was upward' of 10,000 rank and file, and not 6,000, as stated in the journal. The Governor-General did not countermand any reserves, which had been ordered to the front by the Commander-in-Chief. The counter orders for the march of the Meerut force, emanated from the Commander-in-Chief himself, and were approved by the Governor-General. The Sikhs dild not attack the British army at Moodkhee on the 18th o' December, the British army advanced upwards of two mile to attack the Sikhs; and, lastly, I can assure you that neither the treachery of Lala Singh nor of any other Sikh Sirdar in any wayjfacilitated the operations of the British army or the success of the British arms during the Sutlej campaign. On account of the position which I had the good fortune to fill on the late Lord Hardinge's Staff, I trust that you wil. excuso me for addressing you on these subjects, as there I no one whohad a better opportunityof becoming acquainted with the details of the Sutlej campaign than "Your most obedient servant, "R.

TIM MURDEP. AT WO:nGHAi.-A few hours after the examination of the mniacl John Blackwell before Mr. Daley, the chief magistrate, on-Thursday last, for the mnurder o Thomas Rance, he was removed to the county gaol at heading. Since his incarceration the symptoms of insanity have been so strongly -manifestedthat he haa been constantly placed underthe watch of awarder. Inthe first might the inmates of the gaol were disturbed by his ravine noise, and in his violence he broke the windows of the c311 in wich ho was placed. He also made a violent attack- on the warder, and seized him by the neck,hut he did nr serious mischief, assistance being immnediately procured by sounding the alarra bell, which is connected with each cell. As no doubt can exist as to his insanity, he will in bu few days be removed by an order from the iSeretary of State to a luinatic asylum,wherehe will be subjected to proper restraint. Anin netwas heldion view of the body of thedeceased man, 'hotas Rnce, before Mr' . o Clarke, -the coroner for the county, on the afternoon of Friday. The only additional pticulrs elicited were from the evidence of the granidfather, William Blackwell, -who said that the deceased camne to take care of the prisoner for the night, as he (the grandfather) had been recently much disturbed, and wanted to go out and get a night's rest There was a female lodger In the house, hut she was so deaf that she could not hear anything.

TheVolcano deam vessel, Madter-Commander Hocidogs (floating smithy for the China squadron) is having her old boiler taken ont and the Salamander's pat in, which will not detain her longer than a week. The Melville, 72, hospital ship, Commander Trollope, has had her copper stripped off, and is nndergoing a thorough recaulking, which will detain her several days longer in dock. The Abbe Pauvert, a French clergyman and Chevalier of the Iegion of Honour, has, it is said, at length solved the problem of converting English iron into steel. IL Meslin, acting on bahalf of the abbe, has made experiments in the dockyard,Woolwich,duringthe last week, byauthorityof the Government and in the presence of the principal officers of the Engineer department and other official personages. He hassucceeded inprovingtotheirsatifaotion that he can pro. duce steel of very superior quality from the most ordinary cast and puddled iron, and pieces of iron in any state, at an extraordinary reduction in price. M. Pauvert has secured his invention by a patent from the British Gorernment. The articles of newly invented steel tested at the dockyard were clipping tools, chisels, taps, dies, and, other instruments in general use in factories. The conversion of the metal does not require the slightest chaage in the arrangemente of the melting furnace, the system being compcsed of chymical operations alone. A favourable report was, on Friday, forwarded to the Admiralty, in consequence of which it is expected that the steel will be employed in many of the ordinary purposes for which iron is now used, such as piston-rods, spring &c.
THE BRITISH BANE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Your unprofessional readers must be sorely puzzled at the apparent difficulty of proceeding against the managers of the above swindle. A few words are sufficient to show thatthere is no real difficulty, although the anomalous state of the criminal law mayafford excuses if there be any desire to shelter the offenders. The question is simply one of expense. The assignees have no funds from which to defray it; it cannot be expected that the creditors, who have already suffered so much, should have the burden cast upon them. There is no fund in the Court of Bankruptcy, and the commissioner has no power to direct a prosecution, unless the offence comes within the very limited number created by the bankrupt laws. Let Government authorize Mr. Linklater to proceed in such manner as he may think judicious, and guarantee the expenses of the proceeding. A somewhat similar course was adopted in the well-known case of Barber ,and' letcher, the conduct of the prosecution being left to the solicitors of the Bank, -although the expenses were defrayed by the Government. I cannot think that any man, conversant with the law has any doubt that these persons have committed a criminal breach of it, and, without considering the points most ably explained by the learned Comissioner, I-hate no hesitation whatever in saying that persons joining in representations knowing them to be false, with a view to create,-credit in themselves, if the result of such *edit does or can prejudice others, are guiltykof a conspiracy of a very grave. kind. If the public indignation naturally exited against the perpetrators of great crimes is to be called " prejudice," and urged as a reason for not prosecuting them, many of the trials ending in the conviction and execution of offenders would havea been most unjustly instituted. The cases of Davidson and Gordon, in which Mr. Linklater suceafaully prosecuted, wiU not be forgotten; and it is to be hoped that an opportunity will be given him upon the present occasion to exercise his own judgment and discretion. Yours obedientlv- A MEMBER OF THE BAIL
THE AEGED POISONING AT STA3,PoRD.-On Saturday Thomas Fuller Bacon(who had been conveyed from London on the previous night in custody of Mr. Suoerin. tendent Reed and Inspector Young) was brought up before the Stamford bench, on the charge of having administered arsenic to his mother, Mrs. Ann Bacon, of which she diedon the 15th of May, 1855. At half-past 10 o'clock Bacon, who was res eotably attired in a suit of black, and who appeared perfectly cool and collected, was brought into court, and the examination of witnesses was proceeded with. The -evidence was substantially the same as that given at the inquest a Great Casterton in February last. Mr. George Patterson, chymist and druggist. prove-t that on the 8th of May, 1855 (only a week before Mrs. Bacon's death), he sold an ounce of arsenic to the prisoner, who said he wanted it to poison rats. The sale was entered in a hook kept by Mr. Patterson for the pur. pose, and attested by the signature of the prisoner him. self, and a witness named William Clifton. William, Mays Hibbins (an apprentice) deposed that, at the beginning of the week before Bacon's mother died, the prisoner sent him to the shop of Mr. Wilford for ssxpennyworth of arsenic, telHng him that, if asked what it was for, he was to Pay it was for hardening iron. Mr. Wilford refused to let the youth have the arsenic withont a witnees. On being informed of this, Bacon "laughed it off," and said, " Oh, never mind ; I'll get It myself." The witness added that, when there was any iron to harden at Bacon's workshop, they used prussiate of potash, not arsenic. Mary Riles, charworman, who attended Mrs. Bacon during her brief, though fatal illness, described her symptoms (vomiting and spasms), and said deceased told haer that, having accepted an invitation to dine with her son Thomas (the prisoner), on Sunday, the 13th of May, she was suddenly seized with vomiting and purging after partaldng of some broth. The deceased died on the following Tuesday. Wiliam Clfton was the next witness - ho deposed to accompanyingthe prisonerwhenhe pnurchase tbe arsenio at Mr. Patterson's. Elizabeth Blake said she had knowrn deceased upwards of 20 years, and she was generally a stout healthy woman. Mrs. Ann Bacon, wife of the prisoner's brother William, was then examined at considerable length. On Saturday, the 12th of May, witness saw the de. ceased, who then appeared quite well. Next day witness was sent for to deceased in consequence of her illness. Either on the Monday or Tuesday (the day of Mrs. Bacon's death) witness being in deceased s bedroom, heard the prisonersay to his wife, "Ithink mother had better have something out of that bottle " (referring to a bottle standing on the dressing-table, which witness supposed to contain pe permint, or something of that kind). The bottle containe a erhitish liquid. On the Tuesday evening, shortly after Mrs. Bacon's deatb, prisoner took up the bottle in question, and said, "This is my. bottle1 it won't be wanted any more- Imay as well take it away.' Witness did not see the bottfe afterwards. It was % little square bottle, rather lower than an ordinary medicine. bottle. Witness recollected Mrs. Bacon being ill in Marcb, 1855, ber symptoms being then similar to those of her last illness. On the first occasion she had a cup of tea or coffee at the prisoners hose, about 7 iu the mo and se was taken ill abont 10 or 1L Under the wn.l1of-. his father, the prisoner- suceeded at the death od his mother to some houses in -Protection-- place.

The prisoner ws remanded until Wednesday, when the medical evidence, including that of Professor Taylor, will be taken. Wheu Bacon was taken through the town in an omnibus on his arrival from London on Friday night he was hooted by a formidable crowd, and several stones were thrown at the solicitor who conducted his defence. FRIGHTFUL ACODENT AT CHnIsrs HospiTrALOn Saturday afternoon, between 2 and 3 o'clock, as the Blue-coat boys of Christ's Hospital, Newgate-street, were engaged in their usual sports, two of their number attempted the dangerous, but frequently accomplished feat of scaling the wall of the playground which abuts upon Giltparstreet. One of them descended in perfect safety; but thr other, a fine youth of abont 16, evidently ignorant that a line of pointed iron rails attached to the prenies of Mr. Gilruth, baker, were beneath him, dropped upon tho spikes, where he was impaled for several minutes, un' hi4 affrighted companons gave the alarm, when he was extricated from his horrible position, and the best surgical ai1 from St. Bartholomew's Hospital wAs -ptomptly on the :ROrY COuGE OF SuRuEONS.-The following gentlemen having undergone the necessary examinations for the diploma were admitted members of lhe- cUege at the meeting of the Court of Examiners on the 15th inst.

THE NEW PFENA SZRVITUDE BILL. I . A meeting to consdder the proprioty of petiioiin par liament for the insertion into Sir G. Grey's Bill of clases to secure the employnent of convicts in reproductive labour was held in the 1yptian-hall, Mansion-house, on Saturday. Tho Lord MWayor p resided, and there was a full attendance of members of the Legislature and other gentlemlen interested in the improvement of the criminal law. The LoRD MAYOR briefly explained his object in convenizg the meeting, and referred t3 the communiclitions he had received from all parts of the country on the subject of our criminal population. Adverting to thu destitution of the metropolis and his own personal visits to the refuges and asylums resorted to by its poor, he urged as a point of psrs. mount importaucetho necessity of dealing promptly with the case of offenders who on being discharged from priton had no ostensible means of Vlvig.- -Ur. 0. PEARSON then addressed the assemblage at great length, expounding in detail the views he has previously advocated on prison discipline. The gist of his argument was that criminals shoulc be made to su.ppoit thenmselves by working at their own handicrafts. Reciting the principal provisions of the Government measure, he said he was willing to concede the large discretionary oowers with which it would invest the Home Secretary. Indeed, he - s anxims to-extend'those powers furtber, so as to enable Sir 0..GreyVt give.a trial to his- (Mr. Pearson's). own scheme. 'He denied that his viewa had yet bsen practically tested, and.. repudiated with. some indignationr the -absurd attempt to raise crops by convict labour from the bleak and eranite soil of Dartmoor, which had been passed off in his name. The experiments at Dartmoor and Port. land were wretched caricatures and travesties of the plan he had enunciated. .At present the average cost of a prisoner's keep was 261. per annum,against vwhich the only eet-offfrom -his reproductive labour was 11 4s. 7d. By making each convict work at the calling he fellowed before lapsing into mrilue his average earnings would be L0. per week, and the cost of lils food 3s, To maintain a proper balance of industries in our various gaols magiatrates should be authorized, 'with the consent of the Home Secretary, to transfer their prisoners from one county to another. Mr. 31. D. HILL (Recorder of Birmingham) vouched for the perfect practicability of Mr. Pearson's plan, which he contended would inflict the most salutary punishments in the form Ieast burdensome to the tax-paying community. Having enlarged upon the disciplinary effect of useful labour, he ooncluded by moving a series of resolutions recommnending-1, the substitution, in certain casn, in lieu -of fixed periods of imprisonment and transportation of a roportionate number of hours of labour to be performed oy the convict either at home or in the colonies - 2 the holding out of such inducements to criminals as, in conjunction with proper moral and religious instruction, would render them "the voluntary instruments of their own maintenance, punishment, reformation, and release ," 3, the enabling justices of counties and boroughs to ex cange prisoners, with a view to a better industrial clasi. fication; and, lastly, the appointment of a committee to carry out the foregoing resolutions. The motion was seconded by Mr. G. CRuxCKSIUNlI, and Bupported by the Rev. J. DAVIS, of Rochester, the latter gentleman insisting that restitution should be exacted from the crimil, not only for his original offence, but for mahing himself a burden to society while in custody. Mr. SrDNEy advocated the assignment aystem pursued in the earlier history of our colodeo, illustrating its beneficial workug even under peculiarly unfavourable circumstances by the example of New South Wales. There settlers of the convict class, who used to be paid for their labour-contracts in "rum" were now in possession of a bank that had never failed, and also kept their ownv carriages. (Laughter.) Re. formatozy institutions should be introduced into the cle. nies, where they would work even better than at home. Mr. Er.0ov caused some merriment by maldng a vgorous onslaught upon the " humanity-mongers," who bt splen did pces for our thieves, pamnpering them with every luxury enjoyed by the nobleman, while they neglected the misery of the honest labourer, and taught him to speculate on the superioity in point of comfort of crime over steady industry. Characterizing Mr. Pearson's scheme as one of -many "quack recipes" for curing the same evil, and throw- ing ridicule on his proposed "exchange of prisoners," ch he remarked would require the settin up-perhaps in the Lord Mayores omrn official residenco-of a " criminal clearing-house," he wound up a lively speech by moving an amendment in accordance with his views, which failed however, to find a seconder. Lord RANzs.Gss avowed himself. an adherent of the much-decried system of transportation; denouncing, at the same time, the practice ofallowing notoFious thieves, with no ostensible means of gaining an honest livelihood, to roam at large in this country. 3xr. EmrM JoNMs came to the rescue of " the humani. tarians,' and cited his own personal experiente to prove that the prison disciplne to which misdemeanants of the second class are subjected is now sufficiently severe. He also protested against clothing the Home Secretary with the unprecedented powers sought to be vested in him by the new Bill, and advised the setting of our convicts to reclaim the waste lands of this country. At this stage of the proceedings the audience began to thin rapidly, the members of Parliament present being the first to depart to attend to their legislative duties, and in a short space but a few gentlemen remained to prolong the business. Concurrently with this falling off In numbers the discussion grewr more desultory and even somewhat acrimonious. ~. . Mr. PowsAL complained that the meeting had been too much tied down to the consideration of Mr. Pearson'splan, and no time was left fo- entering into the more generai question at issue. Mr. LIMATB, who offered to second Mr. Elliot's amendment, hut was informed by the chairman that he was too late, alsoalegedit as a grievance that, though the,y had been invited by the card of admission to a consul. taton, the first hour and a half had been taken up with a An adjournment was also mooted by several speakers, and though Mr. Pearson, backed by the Lord Myor, at first urged the propriety of agreeing to the resolutionsbefore separating, in order that the meeting might have its due effect upon the discussion in Parliament that night, the proposal to hold another sitting was strenuously persevered in. An additional element of acerbity was imported into the Erooeodings by a taunt thrown out in the heat of the moment .y Mr. Pearsona inst Mr. Pownall for his "new-born zeal in behalf of the reformation of juvenile offenders"-& sareasm which the worthy gentleman assailed repelled with some warmth. Perfect harmony was, however, soon restored, and the meeting, which had lasted from 1 o'clock tilL halfpast 4, was at length adjourned to Monday at 12. The usual compliment was paid to the Chairman.
M| ma. BAcoN's Co1NFJssIo.-It was stated in the report of the trial of Baoon and his wife that, at the close of theproceedings, Lord Campbell, after the iury had returned their verdict, in an emphatic manner expressed his entire concurrence in that portion of it which exonerated the male prisoner from any share in the transaction, and he at the same time said that it would no doubt be satisfactory to the jury to hear that the woman had admitted that she, and. she alone, had committed the dreadful crime, and that her husband had nothing whatever to do with it. It has already been stated that Bacon has all along asserted that this was ths case, and he had taken every opportunity to urge upon his wife to retract the statement sbe made at the police-court, in which she asserted that her husband was the murderer, and which was no doubt the foundation of the proceedings that were ultimately taken agagst him. She, however, maintained a dogged silence until the'end of the first day's trial, when, shortly after she had been taken hack to her cell, she expressed a desire to make a statement, and upon some of the authorities of the gaol going to her she at once said that the statement in question was false, and that she had herself destroyed her children. She stated also that it was quite true that Bacon had left her in bed when he proceeedea on his journey to Reigate, and that very soon afterwards the idea of destroying her children came into her mind.. She frst took the little boy out of his bed and cut his throat, and then carried hinm down stairs and p laced him in the chair in the position in which he was foun, with the toys before him. She says that the child died almost instantaneously, and uttered a very slight cry when she first cut him with the knife. She states that she tben determined to kill the baby, but she felt great reluctance to destroy the youngest child, and she did not do so until some time after the little boy was dead; but at length she could no longer reSst the desire for destruction, and she cut the second child's throat in the same manner she had done the first, but this child she left in the room where the deed was comnitted. She says she has very little recoUection of what occurred afterwards; but she remembered hearing ber relation, Irs. Mfunro, knock at the door in the aternoon, but was afraid to let her in; and she remained in the house with her dead children all the Monday and the suceeading night, and on the following morning went out with the intention of paying her rent - and upon meeting Mrs. Munro and her mother the thonght suddenly came into her mind that she would tell them that a strange- man had got ii at the window and murdeied the children, and she expected that this would avert suspicion from herself. She said that, finding it did not have this effect, and that she was taken into custody, she then becme alarmed and her mind began wandering, and after the women had been talking to her, and had told her that if she did not, clear herself she would in all probability lose her life, she resolved to accuse 'oer huibandapand acordinglyo made'the sthtement,;which led to'his' eing taken into custddy and to his eventually being -commlitted to take his trial together with hei for themunler. At this time the learned judges had left the court, but on their arrival on the folowing morning a communication was immediately made to the Lord Chief Justice of what had taken place; hut as there were no means of legally bringing the matter before the jury (a statement of this description, made by one pilsoner in reference to another, not beig legally admissible), the only course that remained open to the learned judge was to point out the entiro absence of anything ilke nositive evidence against the male prisoner, and he sammned up the case very much in his favour, and the result was that antlidpated by every ono-namely,' the acquittal of the male pnsoner. On Friday afternoon, before Bacon was romoved from Newgate, he expressed a desire to have an interview with his wife, and the request being acceded to the interview took place in tbo presence of Mr. Weatherhead, the governor of the gaol, and the ordinary. They were both very much affected, and Bacon, 'at the close and several times during the interview, earnestly entreated his wife to speak the truib, and clear himu from the suspicion of being concerned in committing such a dreadful crime; and she replied that she had done so. -In the course of the afternoon the male prisoner was removed by MrBead, the chief officer of Stamford, under a warrant chartIng him with the murder of hbi mother. Although this step has been taken, the probability is that Bacon will be brought back to be tried at the Central Criminal Court. The coroner's inquisition has alresdy been removed. under Palmer'sAct, to the Court of Queen's Benob, and when the grand jury, at the ensuing assizes.~ hive returned a true bill; that will alsobi' reioved, and the urisbner'will in all probability be trx#d at- the Aiigutt session of the Veta (Iriminal Cour. Mr Bi6on has not yet been removed from Newgate,' but she will eventually be conveyed to the criinl warad of Bethktbem Aslum,-Q6sacr.,7

In a central situation, all will have easy access to him and to the catalogue-tables. The beok presses under the galleries within the public room are fused with a large library of reference for the use of the readers, oomprising most of the standard works in the various branches of learning, and an extensive collection of dictionaries of all languages, biographicalworks, enoyclopndias, Parliamentary histories, topographical works, &c. These hooks, which are about 20,001 in number, the readers can consult a. pleasure, without filling up tickets for therm. Indeed, the trustees deserve credit for the practical and popular improvements in the general administration of the libraries they have thus permitted to be accomplished. MANSLAUGHTER BY A Boy.-On Thursday Mr. Myers held an inquest at Eirkham on the body of Betty Titterington, aged 14,who had been stabbed by John Elliot6, aged 15. Mr. radnell, surgeon, said that the wound was on the left side of the neck, about 1i inch in length and 2 inches in depth. The knife had cut through the carotid artery and the jugular vein, and through one portion of the winidpipe. Thebleedingfromthatwound wassufficient in itself to cause death. Elizabeth Rawstorne, aged 13, said,about 7 o'clock on Tuesday night, when seven of us, including Betty Titteriugton, were plaring together at the bottom of Little-lane, Elliott came up. He, was cutting a piece of wood with a knifo. Itaidto him "You mnust mind or you will cut yourself" He turned round, picked tp a stone, and thrbw it at -me. He then went np:the lane,. and the girs followed.. Betty Tittenington said, loud enough for him to hear, that they were to call him "Tins," and Margaret Corner and Ellen Fairclough did so. He then threw a stone at Betty Titterington. She went to him and said "I won't have that for nothing;-" and sheptshed him. She then had the stone which Elliott had thrown at her in her hand. Elliott kicked her, ana sheraised the hand in which abe held the stone to sirike huim. He had: the knife in his le hand, aid ho madeza cut at her. Blood-lowed im3nediately: iH cut two or three mnore cbips off the wood, which he was making a "guinea" (a toy) of; but as soon as he saw the blood he ran away. N"one of the other girls struck Elliott. Mary Devannagh, a married woman, said,-I saw Betty Titterington push Elliott. He then struck her, but I did not notice with which hand, and he "punched" her with hig right foot. I afterwards saw the blood ooming from the neck of the deceased. She put her hand to her nec' as soon as she was struck. Elliott remained standing close by for half a minute. My husband put his hand on the wound on deceased's neck, and the blood came through her mouth and nose. This caused me to faint, and I saw nothing further. The poor girl walked a short distance towards home, and then felL She died immediately on reaching the house if she was not dead when taken in. Her motber had seen her half an hour before getting her supper Mlliott ran away, and spent the night in the ftelds. He was sought for in vain until Wednesday morn. ing, when he delivered himself up. When charged with the murder of the deceased he said "She struck me fliat." When asked for the knife he tooi it from his pocket and said, "I had it in my hand then I atrckher, but it was shut, and I must have cut her with the back of it or with my nail=." The knife had marks of blood in the inside. Tho jury returieda verdict of "Manlaughter," and the prisoner ws commiitted for tril at .the Ivertpool asfiizes.
