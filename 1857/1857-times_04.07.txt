RARK-LANE> MOaNAY A'rFRonaA A - I
The arrivals of wheat and flour last week were good, ot beans and peas scanty, of oats and barley very lage. The exports were 75 quarters of oats, and 728 sack of flour. The receipts of native wheat were 7,969 quarters, of foreigm 9,395 quarters. The morning's supplies from the near counties were fair, but business was on the most limited scale in the best wheat, at X. reduction of ls to 2s per quarter, secondary sorts requiring a greater abatement, an,! inferior being wholly pasaed by. Fine foreign -was little altered, not being pressed; but th(i lower kinds were as difficult to quit as English, at an equal reduction.
There vwere 17,173 sacks of flour from the country, withi 12,566barrels, 14G sacks of foreign. Norfollks sold slowly, with little change of price, 3S5. being obtainable per sack. American was placed with difficulty, and in buyer's favour. Town millers lowered the top price 4s. per sack, fixing it at 52s.
Of barley the English supply was only 1,975 quartersthe foreign reached 29,124 quarters. Business was very difficult, the best malting being Is. to 2s. down, and the middling and lower qualities still more reduced.
The alue of malt was nearly nominal, from the almost impossibility of selling.
The oats supply was 59,018 quarters; of this 44,342 quar. ters wero foreign, 13,259 quarters Irish, 602 quarte
Scotch, and 815 quarters English. The arrival so far ex. ceeding the demand, a further reduction was inda.ced to the extent of is. to 2s. per quarter, the latter extreme rate referring to parcels heated on the voyage, and very inferior sorts.
There were 879 quarters of English, and only 50 quarterij of foreign beans. Of peas the whole quantity was 41 quar. ters. Both these pulse were Is. per quarter cheaper. Of linseed 11,440 quarters were received, and S55 quarters exported. The market stood well at a decline of Is. per quarter, with a fair sale for cakes.
The seed season being advanced, prices were easier for red cloverseed; and white, though offered several shillings lower percwt., was neglected. It was the same with trefoil and tates. Butnmustardseedswas fully ls. per busheldearer. BRempseed, canaryseed, and other sorts much a3 las1 quoted.

Monday Evening.
The Bank of England, which during the recent thatting of the transfer boolcs has made its usual ,q aaterly advances on stock at 6& per cent., gave
4 tice this afternoon that the rate for such advance3 - ill now be 7 per cent., and that they will be limited to seven days.
This movement was not generaly known until after business hours, when it caused Consols to be "oId at a further decline. It is, however, precisely .similar in character to that adopted at the approach of the dividend payments in January last. The rate of discount was then 6 per CeLt., and the charge for loans on Government isecurities was put up to 6i. The step might therelore have been *nticipated. Within the last five weeks the aggregate amount taken from the Bauk on these securities has been extremely large, and now that the ostensible reason for which the assistance was granted no longer exists it is right that they should be brought within a compass not to interfere with the supplies available for regular com3nercial operations. The Bank is not bound, either by precedent or in any other way, to make these advances after payment of the dividends on any terms whatever, and supposing an anticipation to have been entertained of the necessity of increasing the stringency of the present discount arrangements it may be presuned they would have been -withheld altogether. 'Whether this course will ultimately be adopted may depend probably upon the gold movements of the present week.
Thbe English funds opened this morning at the closing quotations of Saturday, but the market again became heavy in the afternoon, the fact of the Simla having brought from Australia only a fourth of the amount at first reported by her tendIng to diminish the disposition to steadiness. The filst transactions in Consols for money were at 9° g to g, and the prices at the official close were 93 to J for money, and 932 for the May account. After regular hours, owing to the notitication from the 33ank, there were sellers for money at 92k. Bank Stock left off at 2164 to 218i ; Reduced, 91~ to 92; and New Three per Cents., 92 to t, all ex. dividend; India Stock, 222 to 224; Exchequerb3onds, 98R to 4g; Tndia Bonds, 5s. discount to par; and Exchequer-bills (March), Is. discount to 3s. preminum.
The payment of the dividends on the stocks lately shnt Will commence on Wednesday, the 8th.
The demand in the discount-market is still active, and at the Bank the applications are believed to be nlmerous, and of a character to indicate that there is no general expectation of an early return to an easier condition.
Foreign securities opened with heaviness, and prices subsequently became generally weak, and ¢losed at a decline. Turkish Six per Cents. for inorey were negotiated at97i and i, and for the account at Th, i, i , and J. Mexican was dull, with few operations, t~hose for the account bein at 234 and g. The other transactions comprized-Bra-
ilhan Five per Cents., for money, 100i; for the account, 101; Ecuador New Consolidated, 14i; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., for the account, 78; the Three per Cents., for the account, 54i,; Portuguese Three per Cents, 454 and 441; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 96; Sardinian Five per Cents., 904 ; Spanish Three per Cents., 41; and Dutch Two-and-a-Halfper Cents., 65k.
The corn-market to-day again exhibited much depression, and sales could not have been pressed even at a decline of 2s.
I he final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were (;9,. S('c. for money and G9f. 80c. for the end of the month, showing another fall of nearly a quarter per cent. The market generaly manifests great dulness, and according to some reports the position of the Bank of France does not continue to improve.
The Orwell has arrived from Melbourne with 49,384 ounces of gold, valued at L97,5361., and the Derwent with 16,263 ounces, valued at 65,0521.
The commercial advices from Australia by the Simla are not favouirable. The accounts taken by the Oneida of the state of the import-market are said to have been discouraging, and in the inter-
'e ill' fortnight there had been uninterrupted duhse,,s. By some writers it is alleged that more difFiculty was experienced in selling goods than at any time since 1854. Almost all branches of business, except the iron, hardware, and timber tirades, are described as having been overdone, and in the latter the recent arrivals had been very large. In addition to the Royal Charter, vith 501,0001. the following vessels had cleared out with gold for England :-the Brilliant, with 17,965 ounces; the Copenhagen, with 46,045 ounces; the Thames, vwith 4,780 ounces ; the Anglesea, with 48,862 ounces; the South Carolina, witlh 20,493 ounces; the Sydenham, with 31,462 ounces; and the Morning Star, with 32,209 ounces, nmaking a further aggregate of 807,0001. The Light of the Age, also, and the WVave of Life, have left Sydl.ey,-one with G,500 ounces, and the other with 3,00 ounces.
Tiue Sinila, which brought the present Australian mail to Suez, did not caU at Mauritius, as might be inferred from the wording of the telegraphic aunmnary of the intelligence. Such a deviation from the rioute wiould have been contrary to the terms of the contractt with the European and Australian Cornpany, which require the steamers to proceed direct from King George's Sound to Point (le Galle. The mails from Mauritius were brought to Aden by the " Mascareignes," a vessel belonging to 3DIessrs. Merron, Lambert, and Co., who have a contract with the English and French Governments for the monthly conveyance of mails between Aden and the Mauritius, in correspondence with the steamers of the Peninsular and Oriental Company. The Simra brings only 21,419 ounces of gold, or a5,0001., and not 85,000 ounces, as reported yesterday. With regaud to the Oneida it appears that when the present mail left Point de Gale she was 20 days overdue there, but at this season of the year, supposing *ny accident to have happened to her machinery in the legion of tbe Equator, she might, in consequcince of the calms that generally prevail, occupy a loiig time in making her way under canvass to that pout.
The trade reports from the manufacturing towns for the past week state that business has received a Bslight check from the advance in the Bank rate of di:ceunt, especially at Manchester, where caution is also induced by doubts as to the stability of the cotton-market. At Birmingham there has been no alteration in the iron trade. The foreign demand for meetal manufactures has been good, and the general occupations of the place exhibit averaue activity. In the wooUen districts there has been dulsess. The Nottingham advices state the Am( rican orders for hosiery to be very large, while for home accoiin t the transactions both in hosiery and lace have been limited. In the Irish linennarkets there has been a fair amount of business %i lwithout any general alteration in prices.
The payments of tea duties under the reduced sCale have already been extremely heavy. At the london Custom-house alone the amount has been 320,0001.
In the general business of the port of London during the past week there has been increased activity. The number of vessels reported inward was 276, being 115 more than in the previous week. The total number cleared outward was 145, includmg 31 in ballast, showing an increase of six.
T he departures from the port of London for the Australian colonies during the past week have compri.ed six vessels-three to Port Phillip, two to Adelaide, and one to Hobart Town-with an aggregate capacity of 5,105 tons. The rates of freight exhibit heaviness.
The Peninsular and Oriental steamer Alhambra will take out to-morrow about 10,0001. or 1b,0001. bar gold for Cadix.
The Cambula, from China, has arrived with 492,2001b. of tea and 1,318 bales of silk.
A correspondent callb attention to a paragraph in the Shil<pi.ng Gazette of the 2d inst., under the head of " Hongkong," stating that the Lady Mary Wood, Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamer, dedined rendering any asaistance to a shipwrecked vessel, on the plea that their mail contract prohibited them. It has been generally understood that the contract of this company permits their vessels to stop or devlate from their course for the purpose of assisting to save life, but not property. Vfthe contrary is the case, as would seem from the report in question, it is to be hoped the heartless ystem will at once be remedied by the authorities.
The subjoined letter relates to the plan lately anlounced by the local Government of Victoria for the construction of railways in that colony :-
"Geelong and Ielbourne itaiway comnpany, Sir.-As ~London, April 2.
'Sir,-As consdderable mnsapprehenaion bas existed in the ainds of the public of this country concerning the policy adopted by tho Goverrnment of Victoria in the genoal con.
struction of railways in that colony, I beg to annex a statement taken from the Sydney Herald of the 24th of December last:-
' The style in which the Government proposes to eater upon railway undertakings is commensurate with the general progress of the colony. No leEs than 1,500,0X01. sterling is to be borrowed and spent next year on these important and necessary works, as detailed in the following resolutions which the Surveyor-General has submitted for the adoption of the Legislative Assembly:-
1. That it is advisable to proceed at once with the construction of 18i miles of railway, to cousist of 110 miles of single and 75 of double line.
'2. That the lines undertaken shall bo from Mrelbox.rne to Castlemaine and Sindhurst, comprising 70 miles of single line and 24 miles of double line; and from Geelong to Ballarat, comprisiug 39 miles of single line and 21 of double.
'$ ' 3. That in the main lines the width of the excavations and embankmsents, bridges, viaducts, and tunnels shall be such as to allow of a double track being laid throughout the whole of their length.
' 4. That for the preeent only a single Iiine of way shall be laid down, except in places which are to be used as StOppiDg and passing places for the train, the aggregate lngth of which on the lines between Melbourne and Castlemaine and Sandhurst will be 24 miles, and on the line between Geel.ng and Ballarat 14 miles.
i ' 5. That for the purpose of carrying out the foregoing resolutions the Government is empowered to employ an anmount of labour equal to 5,000 men during the year 1857.
' 6 G. That there shall be employed on the line to Castlemaine and Sandhurit an amount of labour equal to 3,400 men.
m" '7. That there shall be employed on the line between Geelong and Ballarat during 1857 an amount of labour equal to 1.600 men,
"S. That for the purpose of constructing the railways comprised in the second resoluti'2n there shall be raised by h.an during the year 1857 a suin not exceedingl,500,0301.
' ' 9. That a sum not exceeding 1,000,0001. shaU be expended upon the line from Melbourne to Castlemaine and Sandliurst. of which there shall be spent for labour 080,0001 and for plant 320,0001.
" ' 10. That the sum of 500,0001. shall be expended on the main line from Geelong to Ballarat during 1857 of which there slhall be spent on labour 320,0001., and for plant 1s0,000,-
" ' 11. That for raising the sum of 1,500,0001. so to be expended in 1857 there be issued debentures in the sums of not less than,101. bearing interest at the rate of 5 per cent., to be paid off at tvwo years' notice at any period after 20 and witlhn 50 years from the date of issue such debentures not to exceed in all the sum of 1,000,0001:, and that there be disposed of annuities in sums of 51. and upwards for periods exceeding 30, and not exceeding .0 years, so that the total amount of annuities to be paid in any year shall not exceed the sum of 30,0001.
" ' 12. That to make up the said snm of 1,500,0001. there may bo issued bonds not exceeding in all the sum of 250.C001., bearing interest at the rate of 3d. per diem, and having a currency of two years, such bonds and the interest accruing thereon to be receivable in payment lof pubic revenue at any treasury or custom-house in the colony.'
" Contracts have already beeni taken by the Government Rallway Board for works between Melbourne and the IMount Alexander goldfields, but no contracts had yet been let upon the second trunk line from Geelong to Ballarat.
I1 It remains to be seen therefore if this and other lines of railway will be sanctioned under colonial Acts of Incorporation with Parliamentary guarantees, or whether the Governument measure will comprehend all similar works in the colony of Victoria.
'I am, Sir, your obedient servant,

The Kidderminster Riots.
THE KIDDBRRfIlfSTER RIOTS.
KIDDERMINSTER, MOn,DAY.
The Kidderminster riotors wvere again brought up for examination before the magistrates to-day. There is still considerable excitement in the towvn, and the approaches to the police-court wvere thronged by an eager crowvd for a considerable timite before the hour appointed for the hearing of the cases. To-day htr. Kettle, barrister, instructed by Mr. Alfred Walters, solicitor, of Birminghan, appeared to prosecute the rioters.
The first case called on was that against John Hayes and John Cook, remanded from Friday on a charge of assaulting th poli e after the Riot Act had been read. By the advice of their solicitor the accused withdrew their plea of " Not Guilty" and pleaded " Guilty" to the charge. Mr. Crowther addressed the bench in mitigation of punishment, and, after an admonition from the bench, they were sentenced to pay a fine of 30s. each and costs, and in default one month's
imprisonment.
'iThe money was paid.
The other persons wvho had been remanded from last Friday for assaulting the police and breaking the windows of the Swan Hotel and rioting were then caUed up. Their
ammes are Thomas Yoangiohns, John Llowellyn, John SW ain, James WiUiams, and Charles Partridge.
After a long conversation between Mr. Orowther, Mr. Kettle, and the magistrates it was determined to adiourn fhe cases till Saturday next, when the charge of riot will be fully entered into.
There were three fresh charges of riot preferred-viz., against Mr. George Griffith, corn dealer, and a member of the o idderiniinster Town-Council, Mr. Edwin Keysell, butcher, and George Gough. Gough, it Will be remembered, pleaded "Guilty" last Friday to breaking windows at the S aa and was fined ls. Since then, however, he has
een apprehended on a charge of being concerned in the
On the application of Mr. Crowther theso persons were also remanded till Saturday, as there had not been aufficdent time to procure witnesses for the accused.
A lare number of warrants have been issued, and it is expecte that by Saturday a number of persons will have been apprehended. Mr. kettle will then appear for the prosecution, and the charges of riot will be investigated.
Mr. Lowe has recovered from the effects of the brutal treatment he reesived at the hands of the mob, and left Eidderminster for London this morning. A memorial to the right hon. gentleman, expressing sympathy with his sufferings, is in CORrse of signature by the inhabitants of Kidderninster, and has alroady beenesigned by some 500 persons of all classes and politics. Thefollowing is a copy of the memorial:

The polling took place yesterday, and resulted in the triumphant return of the two Liberal candi. dates. The Albion Hotel, -where the central committee of Lord R Grosvenor and fr. Hanbury sat, was surrounded throughout the day by an anxious crowd, who perused the hourly returns of the state of the poll with great interest. The Union Hotel opposite, the head-quarters of Viscount Chelsea, also exhibited signs of activity, but the Conservative committee contented themselves with exhibiting during the day the numbers poUed for their candidate at the Charing-cross polling-booth during the first hour, which exhibited a slight majority in favour of Lord Chelsea. From an early hour the election of the Liberal candidates appeared to be safe, and every successive return from thovarious polling districts exhibited an increasing majority in their favour. The onlypollingdistrictinwbichLord Chelsea obtaineda majority was at Bedfont, where he polled 219 votes against 195 for Ir. Hanbury, and 192 for Lord R.Grosvenor. At Bethnal-green and Mile-end, where Mr. Hanbury's local influence is great, the preponderance of Liberal votes was remarkable. In the populous district of Hammersmith, where Conservative influence has on former occasdons been successfully shown, the Liberals poIled nearly two to one. At King's-cross and Hampstead they polled more than two to one. In West. miinster Lord Chelsea made a better fight. At 10 o'clock the three candidates had each polled 58 in the Westminster district, according to the Liberalreturn, but at 12 o'clock the Liberal candidates were in a majority, and at the close of the poll they were 70 ahead. The Liberals early saw the probable consequences of split votes, and exerted themselves with success to impress upon the electors the necessity of not giving pIlmpers. In the Hammersmith district the votes at 12 o'clock for Gresvenor and Hanbury respectively were 526 and 524; at 2 o'clock 674 and 671; at 5 o'clock, when the poll closed, 895 and 905. The gross return at 2 o'clock ex-
sijlited Mr. Hanbury at the head of the poll, and at the close of the poll he was in a majority of 102 over Lord E. Grosvenor, and a majority of no less than 2,510 over Viscount Chelsea. Lord R. Grosvenor's majority over Viscount Chelsea was 2,408.
The following are the returns published by the committee of Lord R. Grosvenor and Mr. Hanbury :-

Total ... 5,324 5,426 2,916
The result is regarded as one of the most signal defeats which the Conservatives have experienced during the present general election. At the Iast election for MEddlesex the Marquis of Blandford poUed 4,258 votes, Mr. Bernal Osborne only winning his election by a majority of 32. Since that time the Conservatives have given more attention to the registration, and have added large numbers to the registry by means of the operations of the Conservative Land Society. The Liberals do not fail to congratalate themselves upon the fact that not a single Conservative now possesseb a seat for the metropolitan districts.
The official declaration of the numbers will be made by the Sheriffs of London at Brentford to-morrow (Wednesday) at 12 o'clock.
B3ERKSHIRE,
The declaration of the poll for this county was made yesterday at Abingdon by Mr. Benyon, the High Sheriff. The numbers were as foUows:-
Palmer ... ... .. .. ... 1,802 Vansittart ... ... ... ... ... 1,494 Bouverie ... ... ... ... ... 1,524 Vernon ... ... ... ... ... 1,360
Mr. BirxYoN having declared Mesrs. Palmer, Vansittart, and Bouverie duly elected,
Mr. PALMER came forward to return thanks. He said that he had to express his gratitude to the electors for having now returned him for the 11th time, brt on the present occasion he had obtained a signal mark- of favour from the electors, for he had been elected without canvassing for a single vote. (Applause.) His hon. coUeague, Mr.Vansittart, had also requested him to thank the electors in his name for the honour they had conferred upon him, as he himself was not able to remain to do so for himself. (Signs ofdisapprobation.) The reason was that he wished to vote in two other counties that day. He had on a late occasion so fuly explained his political views that he did not think he should be justified in again dweUing upon that subject, but he was prepared to answer any question which any elector mnght think fit to put to him. In conclusion, he begged again to repeat his very sincere thanks for the honour which had been conferred upon him. (Cheers.)
Mr. BOUVERIE, who was loudly cheered, said that as that was the first time he had had the honour of addressing the electors of Berkshire as their representative, he should be obliged to trespass a little longer upon their attention than Mr. Palnmer had done. In the first place he begged to return his very sincere thanks to every member of the community, whether elector or non-elector, for the kindness, the courtesy, at? the civility which he had received on all sides; but more eapecially were his thanks due to the 1,524 electors who had placed him in his present position. Ia coinsequence of what had occurred at a maeeting at Newbury, he ha dbeen asked to come forward as a supporter of Liberal opinions, and give the electors an opportunity of recording their opinions. Well, he had done so, and the result must remove the impression which Captain Vernon had conveyed in his speech on Tuesday last that Berkshire was one of the most Conservative counties in England, because more than half of the electors who had polled had voted for him, a Liberal. (Loud cheers.) He went to Parliament to express his own opinions, and fettered by no pledge. (Hear, hear.) The country was, he believed, in a state for progress, and an extension of the suffrage was one of those measures by which progress might be made. (Hear, hear.) The other great principle which he advocated was that of civil and religious liberty. (Hear.) He was not, as had been represented, in favour of universai suffrage, but he thought that the franchise might be extended with great advantage. (Hear, hear.) Ie would not pledge himself to any particular species of reform, but wouid be prepared to bestow his utmost attention on any which might be introduced, and if he approved it to give it his support. He had been told that he had lost support because he would not pledge himself to vote for the repeal of the Maynooth grant, and it had been said that he was a Roman Catholic. Now, that statement he begged to deny. (Hear, hear.) He could not vote for the repeal of the Maynooth grant, not because he was desirous of promoting the spread of the Roman Catholic religion, but because he regarded it in the light of a compact, which could not be infringed without a breach of faith. He would onlyadd that bealso had to vote in another county that day, bat he had thought it due to those who had honoured him with their support to remain and return thanks for the honour which had been conferred upon him (hear) - and he wished to express the hope that when he came before them again to give an account of his stewardship he might be able to meet bis constituents with the full confdence that he had adopted that course which they had expected from him, and that which for his own character he was bound to adopt. (Loud cheers.)
Captain VERNO; then came forward to address the electors. He said that they saw before them the winning horses. (A Voice-" No ! one has run away.") Bolted was the racing phraseology (a laugh), and as there was no plate for beaten orses they might wonder what had made him appear before them. He would teU them in a word. He
a come there out of respect to those gentlemen who had invited him to come forward and who had so powerfuUy supported him, out of respect for his poltical opponents, and out of respect for himself. (Hear, hear.) Ee was bound to admit the fairness and frankness with which he had been treated by his political opponents, many of whom had told him that, although they would not vote for him, they had no personal objectiorn to him. (Hear, hear.) When the late Lord Hardinge was going into Parliament he expressed some doubt as to his ability " Oh, yor'll do weU enough," said the Duke, " if youl only speak upon subjects with which you are conversant, and never quote Latin." (A laugh.) Now, certainly a little Latin was a dangerous thing, and in the course of the present contest he
haa fourod tbe uce Of it by his opponents of advantage to himself. One squib which he had seen alluded to his motto, " Vc770n fsesmse- Vi%," and stated that he wa .o Vc,, which, as ver mneant spring, he understood as an implication that he was not green. (A langh.) By no means a bad compliment. (A laugh.) Dangerous, however, as it was to quote Latin, he felt bound to say, Dulce et deosumn est pro patrid mori, which might be translated that it was an exceedingly pleasant thing to sacrifice himself for the Conservative cause. (Hear, hear.) There was one crcumstance connected with the election which he wished to mention. It had been saggested to him that if he came forward their old and valuable representative Mr. Palmer might withdraw at the nomination, and he had immediately stated that rather thau xach bhould be the case he would himself withdraw. (Loud cheers.) He had also been asked vwhether he would again come forward on a future occasion if his humble services were required. He had taken 48 hours to consider the question, and he had determined that should those services be required he vould not shrink from the contest, but would poll the last man, with the cry of Conservatism for ever and no sar. render. (Loud cheers.)
Three cheers were given for 3r. Palmer, 3ir. Bouverie, and Cautain Vernon, A similar oblation was prowoeed for 3Mr. Vansittart, but thae meeting had evpdendy Mr.en umbrage at the depaLrture of that renloinan, n h

WILTS (SOUTH).
(FROM OUR OWV RBPOBRTR)
The official declaration of the poll was made yesterday at Salisbury. There was a large crowd assembled in front of the hustings to witness the proceedings. It was rtimoured in the morning that the partisans of Lord Henry Thynne, the defeated candidate, Intended to create a disturbance; but the intention, if it ever existed, which is doubtful, was not caried into effect. On the contrary, the greatest good humour provailed among all p %rties, and, although a little excitement would have been pardonabla at the close of an election so keenly contested, nothing occurred to denote the presence of %ngry feelings on one dde or the other. The friends of Mr. Herbert and MIr. Wyndham tempered their triumph with moderation, while those of Lord Henry Thynne bore their disappointment vith exemplary fortitude. The cheers which welcomed the successful candidates were not heartier or more general iban those which greeted their beaten rival when he presented himself on the hustings, surrounded bya considerable body of his principal supporters. In short, the contest has been conducted throughout in a spirit highly creditable to the county, and Mr. Herbert represented the sniversal feeling yesterday when, amid a cheer which made the marketplace of Salisbury ring again, he crossed the hustings and shook hands cordiaUy with Lord Henry Thynne. The proceedings were commenced by
The HiGH SHERiFF, who said-Gentlemen, I have now to announce to you the result of the poll, which took place on Saturday last. The numbers recorded were-
For Herbert ... ... ... 1,517
Wyndham ... .. ... 1,445 Thynne ... ... ... 1,269
It therefore becomes my duty to declare that the Right Hon. Sidney Herbert and WiUiam Wyndham, Esq., are duly elected to represent the southern division of Wiltshire in the next Parliament. (Great cheering.)
lMr. S. HERTsat, who was received with general cheering, said,-Gentlemen, they call the meeting to-day a formal meeting, but there are some forms which have a good deal of substance in them, and I can assure you that it is in no formal spirit that I thank you, which I do most heartily, for the efforts which you have made, and which have resulted in the glorious triumph we have achieved. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, I am going to the now Parliament as your reprosentative. There will be great changes In it. Many old members have been thrown out, many new men have come in, and it will be a difficult task for any Government to bring so miscellaneous a body at once into order. Bet I trust that the Government, by a clear and firm attitude,will have that influence upon the Parliament which an earnest Mlinister or an earnest Govemment always has; while, on the other hand, I hope that we, the Parliament, will devote ourselves assiduonsly to our business, and will be deterred by no personal feelings from doing our duty to those who send us there. (Cries of " Bravo !" and cheers). There is at the present moment what I may almost venture to call a unanimity of opinion among public men upon many of the chief topics of the day; but that does not add to the famility of carrying on business in Parliament, inasmuch as it has made politics in many cases a matter of persons rather than of prsnciples. But, gentlemen, you may depend upon it that I shaU do my utmost to steer clear of any mfluences or opinions other than those which I think may tend to the advancement of the public good. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, I make a very short statement to you, because mny thanks can be conveyed in few and hearty as well as in many words. I thank you, then, most sincerely for what you have done for me. I do not believe that any contest was ever more fairly conducted, or any triumph ever more fairly won. (Cries of "Oh, oh P' and great cheering). Gentlemen, I have to thank not only those electors who, I forget for how many times, have given me their kind support, but also those who are opposed to me. becausewbat I think is creditable to Wiltshire-during the whole of my canvass, occurring in a time of great excitement when political feelings necessarily ran high, I did not meet with one uncivil word (cheers), but was received everywhere with a kindness and courtesy which were as honourable to the electors as they were gratifying to myself. (Gre.,t cheering. ) Gentlemen, bhave only again to thank you most heartily for the honourable position in which you have placed me, and again to assure you that, as heretofore, my best efforts-efforts of the heart as well as efforts of the head-shall be directed to the advancement of the public service and the promotion of your interests. (Prolonged cheering.)
Mlr. WYNDHIAM.-Gentlemen, I have once again to thank you for the honourable position in which you have placed me. You have again reurned me as your representative, notwithstanding the lengthened preparations of the rival candidate and the powerful appliances employed on his behalf. One of the charges brought a"ainst me was that I came forward as the nominee of the douse of Pembroke. To that accusation I hope you have now given a satisfactory answer. (Cheers.) I am proud to act as your representative, and while, on the one hand, I assert your independence of the House of Wilton, I rejoice that you have refused to surrender it to the House of Bath. (Cheers and laughter.) Gentlemen, I again thank you for the honour you have conferred upon me, and assure you that I shall endeavour to justify your choice, and to dischargo my duties as your representative to your entire satisfaction. (Cheers.)
fThe hon. gentleman had his speech written, and at the beginning of every sentence was obliged to consult his manuscript, which he endeavoured to conceal in his hat. Bat the crowd were too sharp for him, and, observing the direction in which his eyes were turned, almost drowned his voice in cries of-" What is that in your hat?' " Is it printed?" " You should have got it off by heart yesterday !" These interruptions, followed as they were by roars of laughter, seemed somewhat to disconcert the hon. gentleman, who experienced great difficulty in making him,elf heard amid the sounds of merriment which burst from every side.]
Lord H. TsrYN.-z. Gentlemen, allow me to return thanks to those electors who have given me their warm and hearty support upon the present occasion. (Cheers.) I am surethat the numbers who poUed for me on Saturday last area sufficient refatation of the charge which has been brought against me of idly stirring up a contest in the county. (Cheers.) I think, moreover, that the energy and zeal evinced by my supporters during the present election amply vindicate theirintontion of asserting the independence of the county (cheers); and I believe that when the next opportunity arrives they will come forward and vote for me as an inependent candidate with the same heartiness and determination which they have manifested upon the present occasion. (Cheers.) Mr. Wyndham has mTken of handing over the county from the House of Pembroke to the House of Bath. (A Voice.-" We won't have it.") I do not ask you to do that, but I do assure you .that as soon as you can find another independent candidate of the same opinions I shall be happy to retire in his favour. (Cheess.) Permit me now to thank those gentlemen who gave me their good wishes, but who, owing to the application of what is commonly called a " screw," were unable to vote for me. (" That is not true," and cheers.) My acknowledgment- are also due to those gentlemen who, though they did not support me in this election, I hope may be persuaded on some future occasion to break through that neutrality to which alone I attribute my defeat. (Cries of " Gammon." and cheers.) Gentlemen, I cannot deny that niy friends and myself feel some disappointment at our defeat, but I do not feel the less indebied on that account to those warm and stanch friends who have so gallantly fought the battle with me on the present election. (Cheers.) In con,l] sion, gentlemen, while tendering to you my most sincer, thanks for your disinterested support, I beg to assure you that should a similar opportunity occur again, and you continue to think me worthy to represent you in Parliainent, I shall have great pleasure in placing my services at yonr disposal. (Cheers.)
Mr. S. HERBERT then moved a vote of thanks to the High Sheriff for the able and impartial manner in which he had di'cbarged his duties during the election.
Mr. WYNDILIa seconded, and Lord HFTRY Tiey.SSF supported, the motion, which was carried with acclamation.
The EIGe SnERiyr, in acknowledging the compliment, expressed the hope that now the election was over all little personal animosities which might have been excited during the last fortnight would drop and be forgotten. (Cheers.)
The proceedings terminated with three cheers for the
NORFOLK (EAST).
The election for this division took place yesterday morning in the Shire-hall, Norwich. The High Sheriff (Mr. A. Fountains) presided as returning officer.
Mr. W, E. L. BuLwEit nominated Major-General C. A. Windham.
Lieutepant-Colonel CusTA=CE seconded the nomination. MIr. HI R. UPCAER nominated Sir E. N. Buxton. Mr. J. T. Mo'rT seconded the nomination. No other candidate being nrorosed
The HEGAH SHRITFF declred Major.General Windham and Sir E. Baxton duly elected amid loud cheers.
Major-General WAsxss, on rising to return thanks, was received with renewed cheering. He said he was a supporter of Lord Palmerston, and believed that if the
looked to the returns from England generaLy they would see that he waS regasrded s the meet proper man for the place he now holds. (Cheer9.) HEI was for progressive icm-
provemexnt. He shouad not offer hn poain a , o h contrary, would give hi. support to any moderate measure brought forw for the improvement of the Reform Bill. (Chees.) Inadditiontothis,there was a vast number of other reforms demanded. There was Administrative reform, legal reform, ecclesiastical rform, and, lastly, military reform. To all these he intended to py attention. As to Adminis. trative reform, as far as he understood it, it meant a proper use of patronage, and the Executive Govemment employing the best method of collecting the revenue, &c. Any measure brought forward to further those objects should have his support. (Cheers.) With regard to legal reform, it would be extremely ridiculous if he were to dive into such a maze. He was a so dier, and not a lawyer, and all he could say was that he was for a large slice of legal reform. (Cheers.) He bad told them he was a soldier, and not a lawyer, and so he would say with reference to the question of eccle. sisatical reform, that he was a soldier, and not a clergyman. They must not expect that he would dabble in any matter of doctrine, but such a question as the church-rates would, he hoped, be amicably rettled. (Cheers.) He would now come to the subject of military reJorm. In calling himself a mfitary reformer he had no intention to set to work to badger the Horse Guards upon every point. What he meant by a military reformer was something vastly greater than that. re wished to see the militia permanently establisbed and weU treated. He wished to see the militia
p in connexion with the army, and to see the system of recrutingvastly improved. He wished to see a cerWin portion of civil ofces yiven to soldiers, provided they showed that by their merit they were fit to hold them. (ChOersr. He wished to see educationi vastly increased, and
that wthout putting themt +~ yaunreasonable and un-
r ecesary expense. What he wisbed to see in the army was that it should be so organized that it could be increased to almost any amount at a short notice without their being called upon to keep up an enormous force. When he looked at tbenormous advantages which they had received from the power of steam, when he remembered how it had benefited their shipping, their manutfactories, and their mines-when he looked at the enormous wealth that it had given them, he could not forget that it had injured them in one respect -viz., in absolutely obliterating the British Channel as a Ineans of defence. He was surprised that anybody should say that nothing ought to be done to render our interior defences better now that our exterior one had been removed. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. T. F. BuxToN thanked the electors on the part of his ;brther, Sir Edward Buxton, who is now at Nice. The hon. gentleman stated that Sir Edward was a sound progressive reformer, and denied the statement that he was in such weak health that he would be unable to attend to his Parliamentary duties.
Mr. C. BuXr{TO, H.P. for Newport, added a few words on behalf of Sir Edward, and stated his belief that his brother would support a settlement of the church-rate question, an extension of the suffrage, and other well-considered reform!,.
Thanks to the High Sheriff for his conduct in the chair closed the proceedings, which were conducted throughout with order and goodhumor,r.
BEDFORD (COUNTY).
DECLARATION OF THE POLL.
Teoiilstate of the pU was announced by the HIighi Seriff, from the Shire-hau, Bedford, yesterday. It differs ! from the statements issued bmy the cemusittees of the candidates, showing a smaller mnajority over thesecond Liberal candidate. The High Sheriff declared the numbers as fel-
Mr. Hastings Russell ... ... ... ... 1,564 Colonel Gilpin ... 1,374 Colonel Higgins 1,343 Captain Stuart ... ... ... ... ... 1,246 The two former having been declared duly elected,
Mr. IHAsrxos RUSSELL rose amid enthusiastic cheerin
and expressed his most sincere gratitude to the electors fgr again consenting to identify him with the principles of civil, religious, and commercial freedom. They had given a most unnmstakeable decision that he should go to Parliament and on their behalf promote those three great principles. The result of tho contest showed a prowth and strength of Liberal principles in Bedfordshire which far exceeded his most sanguine expectations (cheers), and showed the importance of now and then taking stock of each other's opinions The result was greatly due to the patriotic leonduct and active exertions of the gentlemen at Luton. (Cries of " Oh, oh I" from the Conservatives, and a Voice, "Take younr hange out of Luton, ColoneL") The watchwords of the Liberal party were, " Peace, retrenchment, and reform," and it was gratifying to see at this election the principles were recognized by all the candidates who had presented themselves on the opposite side. Peace, happily, they now had; retrenchment would, ho trust, soon follow, and reform would be demanded in the ensuing session of Parliament. The cause of the Liberal party the electors had now placed in his unworthy but not ungrateful keeping. Re earnestly asked them in conclusion to as indulgent to his shortcomings as in times past, and accept his vwarmest thanks for the honour conferred upon him. (Loud cheerm.)
Colonel GILrix, who was recelved with loud cheers by the Conservatives, said he had to offer his heartfelt thanks for the proud distinction which they hAd for the third time conferred upon him. (AVoice.-"But it will be the last.") His opponents knew that the only chance they had to win was by artifice (" No, no," and cheers), so they circulated reports that there would be no contest. Hlis friends, therefore, were unpreparedaltogether, andthey onlygained theirsuccess by the independent electors rushing forward to assert their rights. (" h, oh F' and Lbughtor.) But they had to stand Up not only against trickery, but a coalition (cheers and counter-cheers) -a coalition of high aristocratic names and democratic pliticans who wished to ride roughshod over them. He then commented on the statement made by the other side, that they had only agreed upon a contest a quarter of an hour before the nomination; for in that quarter of an hour the gallant colonel had p?repared an elaborate speech and put it in his pocket, and his emissaries were sent to aU parts of tho county and engaged ali the vehicles. (Cheers, and "That's not true.") They must have won it it had not been for the rotteness of their cause. (Cheers and uproar.) He then proceeded to give some advice to the gentlemen of Luton. This was the second time they had brought out a candidato against him without success, and ho recommended them never to start a bagged fox again.
(,olonel Hs-oGrs returned thanks in a good-humoured speech, in which he asked whother the fact of his polling 1,343 votes at so short a notice, and within 31 of his gallant friend who had just spoken, was not a sufficient justification for his consenting to stand. hCheers. "Yes, yes "') It showed that onlv a little more time was rcquired to mako the resultvery different.
Captain BROWvN-E returned thanks for the generous sapport given to Captain Stuart, who had that day gone to vote at a distance.
A vote of thanks was then given to the High Sheriff, and the candidates went to dinner with their supporters.
CORNWALL (EAST).
The nomination for the eastern division of the county of Cornwall took place in tho Shire-hall at Bodmin on
Mr. SAWLE, late M.P. for Boclmin, proposed, and Mr. HO ELL seconded, Mr. Robartes.
Mr. LrIEsRDrnGI, Chairman of Quarter Sessions, pro. posed, and Mr. POLLARD seconded, Mr. Kendall.
No other candidate being proposed, the Hiara SxERinF (Sir Henry Onslow) declared Mr. Robartes and Mr. Kendall duly elected. (Both these gentlemen sat for the same constituency in the late Parliament.)
Mr. ROBARI-ES then addressed the electors. It was not his own wish to sit in the next Parliament, but those of the constituency whose opinions he more immediately represented thought it maight be injurions to the interests of the Liberal party in the county if he declined to do so, and therefore ne had come forward again. After an explanation of his vote on the China question he said,-Some might suppose, from his vote on that question, that he was opposed to the Government - but that was not the case. Ie should, as before, give it his general but independent support, so long as it acted in accordance with I the principles and the policy which he approved (hear); but
he should follow his principles in preference to any leader. (Cheers.) He was in favour of an extension of the franchise. It might be said that everybody was so now ; but they might romembcr that he had been in favour of it long before many gentlemen who now professed to be so. He thought, with the present increase of education, that it should be extended to many inteligent men who did not at present possess it. He would rather have the people m the citadel than battering against the walls outside (hear, hear); and he thought the extension should take place in a time w'hen there was no great popular excitement in the country. (Hear.) Ile was a supporter of the baUot, and had been so for n,any years. (Cheers.) He would rather be without the franchise thau compeUed to vote contrary to his convictions. (Hear.) HIe shovld vote for the abolition of church-rates. With regard to education, he believed the best way was to assist vountary efforts by grants of money. He was not in favour of a compulsory rate, because he believed it must lead to merely secular education, to which he had a decided objection. He was in favour of as great a reduction of the national expenditure as was compatible with the efficiency of our establishments. He was not inclined to press Government hard on the subject in the present year, as he would give it time to clear away the expenses of the late war; bat next year he hoped there would be a considerable decrease in the estimates for the army and nlavy. He thought that in giving up the war ninepence the Chancellor of the Exchequer had done as much as we could expect in the present year; but, believing that indirect taxes pressed more severely on the lower than on the higher classes he would be sorry to see direct taxation entirely abandoned. (Hear.) gio again thanked tho electors for the honour they had done hiba, and hoped the time was not far distant when they would find a more efficient man to represent them and the good old cause in the Commons House of Parliament. (Cheers.)
Mr. KENDALL said, he had been one of tho very last who held out for Protection ; but when free trade had berome the law of the land he had made no factious opposition to it, and, indeed, had voted for free-trade measures. Ho had rever failed to be present in the House when the question of the Maynootb Grant was brought before it, and ho had never failed to give to that grant his most strenuous opposilion. (Cheers.) In speaking of his ast public conduct, he must refer to the time when Lord Dferby had failed in his attempt to form an Administration. In that attempt Lord Derby had been in communication, among others, with Mr. Gladsteno. He afterwards held a most influential meeting, in which he explained to his party his attempt to form an Administration, and how he had failed. One noble lord had then moved, and another had seconded him, that they were perfectly satisfied with what Lord Derby had done. He (Ur. Kendall) was ono of those who felt that, if Lord Derby had taken Mr. Gladstone and others of like politics into his Administration, he would have had anything but a Conservative Government; and, before the motion was put to the meeting, seeing that no more influential man came forward to do so, he stated that he could not allow his lordship to suppose that it expressed the unanimous feeling of those present. (Hear, hear.) Religious questions at the present moment were matters of the utmost consequence. He felt it to he necessary to watch
narrowly the High Church party. (EIear, hear.) Inthe case of the Russian war he had observed in all parts of the House certain ersons who were sure to join aSainst Lord Palmerston's Government. These were members of the extreme High Church party. In all other questions it was the same. There was a party the object of which was to form an Administration based on extreme High Church principles. In the matter of the Russian war he had always felt that a great debt of gratitude was due to Lord Palmerston; and when he saw that combination the other day-and there was not a man known to be of extreme High Church prinoiples who did not join in it-he did not hesitate oDe moment to give his support to Lord Palmerston. (Cheers.) Though a Conservative, ho had no confidenco in Mr. Disraeli, or any of the leaders of his party. 'i'here was no one in the House of Commons except Lord Palmerston to whom he could look with confidence to carry on the government of the country. (Hear.) He could not vote for the abolition of churchrates, though he should be glad, even at a considerable sacrifice, to meet the conscientious feelings of Dqssenters. With regard to education, ho agreed entirely with Mr. Robartes, that it should not be nade compulsory, and that religion ahbould form the basis of whatever might be done on the subject. (Hear, hear.)
Thebproceedings terminated with X vote of thanks to the Sber ,f and three cheers for the members.
NORTHAIPTONSHIRE (SOUTH).
Yesterday, at the Consity-hal, Northampton, la. W. M. DosEaxy, tbhHigh-Seriff, declared the result of the polling for th5s divisoL of the county of Northampton to he :-

nd traX,. &co=A03ly, Lord Althorp and Mr. Rainsld
Knightley were duly elected knights of the shire to reproSent this county in Parliament.
Mr. XxIGHTLxY then came forward, and was received with mingled cheers and hisses. He aid it now became his duty, as the senior member for this county, although not at the bead of the poll, to return his sincere thanks to themn for returning him a second time as one of the members for the county of Northampton. He did not deny nor conceal a great surprise and a groet regret he felt at the result of the last Friday's election. He fet very great regrettthat thlt county and the House of Commons had lost the services of Colonel Vyse. (Groans, hisses, and cheers.) He was merely expressing his own opinion, and he would wilingly allow them to,koeep;theirs. (A Voice.-" You"ll go out next time.") During the last five years he had bssn upon the most friendly terms with Colonel Vyse, not only in his public life, but also in private, and it was only within the last few months that they had ever disareed in their votes. (Uproar, and a Voice-" Who sold his friend?" Be would go back to the House of Commons determined to follow the course he had hitherto taken. He intended to read every bill brought before Parliament and judge far himself as to its merits, (Applause.) Those thsathe found did not interfere with the sound Parliamentary principles of a Conservative he would support, bat to all others he would give an uncompromising, unflinching opposition. (Cheers and disapprobation.)
The Court was then adjourned to tho market-square, where the hustings had been erected, which
Lord ALTHORP monnted and addressedan audience of about 20,000. He said,-Gentlemen, I stand bere to-day in a proud position. I feel that you have done me the greatest honour in your power in returning me as a member of the House of Commons for this county. (Cheers.) I am proud to stand hero as one of the members for South Northamptonshire (renewed cheers), and I thank you for the honour you hare been thus kind enough to confer upon me; but I am quite unable to convey to you what I feel on this subject. (Loud cheers.) Gentlemen, the Liberal interest lof Northamptonshire until last Friday had been for more than 20 years without a representative in Parliament, but on Friday last, by an immense majority, you declared that the timne when the Conservatives should remain in solo power had gone by (cheers), for then you returned a LiberaL member and he now stands before you. (Loud *ohrs.) I feel averyLseavy res n bility devolves upon myshoulders, especialyas such anenghtened constitwenoyas you are have returned me. I feel diidence before yen I feel my inexpeIence; but I can assure you that my zeal will make up f or my inexperience, (sCheers.) I will endeavour to perform al my duties in the ou ons of Commons. I will perform them for the good of the whole cornty (cheers)-for the rch and poor, the high and low, sad I hopo to satisfy hem a. (Hear, hea.) 1 hope Ishal be able to maintain the rghts of the rich and releve the burden of the

He then referred to the great contest they had had, professed no iUl feeLinz to Colenel Vyse, and hoped he weould have none towvards him, and said that. although he and his colleague dis4reed on many Foints, they wvould always areto icek wrell after the ionternestdo thecoun,ty of orthampton. (Loud and long
ML. Nethereote, Mr. Horsman, M.P., and Sir Francis Shuckburgh afterwards addressed the assembly.
DURHAM (SOUTH).
The poll was declared yesterday (Monday), at the TownaU, Darlpgton, by General Bck with, the High Sheriff, as
follows:
Ir. lIenry Pease (Quaker and Liberal) 2,570 Lord Harry Vane (Liberal) 2,54 5 Mr. Farrer (Conservative) ... . 2,091
The coremony of buckling on swords, the droUery of 'which, so far as Mr. Pease (a Peace-party man, and one of the celebrated Russian deputation) was concemed, conulsed the great assemblage with laughter, was then perfonned.
Mr. PEtSE, in thanking the electors, bespoko their indulgence for his inexperience in Parliamentary duties. He congratulated them upon the spirited and extraordinary manner in which the district had bcen ronas to testify to its principles, and declared that so long as he might be permitted to reprsent those principles he would never falter in upholding them.
Lord HARRY Vs_xE, referring to a charge of an unworthy coalition between himself and M5r. Pease, contended that it was only natural they as Liberals should, to a great extent, bave an identity of support, and then declared himself a firm adherent of the great Liberal party. As to his vote ,ith Mr. Cobden on the Chinese war, he held to hia opinion, butthat question might now be congidered assettled. The great leading journal-2W Timc5 newspaper-classiied Ministerialsts and Oppositionists as they voted on that narrow issue. For his part, he demurred to that classification. Speaking generally and as a Liberal he was a supporter of the Government of Lord Palmerston (cheers), but he didnot bind himself to particular acts. He claimed to be independent and untrammeled, but, as a uere matter of confidence, he was prepared to give his support to that liberal policy w,hich was represented in its chief, Lord Palmerston. The noble lord concluded by testifying to the honesty of purpose and zeal of his late coleague, Mr. Farrer,
MIr. FARRRr., the defeated candidate, assured his friends that, though ousted now from the place he had held for 10 years, he was not thoroughly vanquished, and that on a fitting occasion they would see him, phoiunx-like, risin again. As to the coalition which had been mentioned, he did not complain of that, but of its being denied to the latest possible moment. Englishmen liked plain and straightforward conduct, and not deceit. The hon, gentleman then called attention to the fact that since the last contest in 1841 he had gained 352 friends (his poU then being 1,739), from which he augured favourably for the future, and that Lord Harry Vane had lost two. He hoped the noble lord would live long enough to lose them all. (Laughter.)
The proceodings closed with a vote of thanks to the Sheriff, and throe cheers for the new members.
YORKSHIRE (NORTH RIDING).
The official declaration of the result of tho polling was made yesterday on the hustings erected in the York Castleyard, at noon.
Sir Joseph Radcliffe, the High Sheriff, amnounced the numbers to be as follows:-
The Plon. 0. Duncombe... .. ... 5,259 Mr. B. S. Cayley ... ... ... 4,641 The Hon. J. C. Dundas ... ... .. 4,185
He therefore declared the Hon. 0. Duncombe and Mr. Cayley duly elected knights to serve in the ensuing Parliament. (Cheers.)
The hon. members having put on their swords,
The Hon. 0. DUNCOOSEB addressed the assembly, thanking thom for having, for the fourth time, returned him to Parliament as representative for the North Riding. He returned to Parliament in the same independent position hohad hitherto maintained, free asthe air he breathed and ready to give the best consideration to every measure, by whomsoever introduced. He did not regard himself as the representative of any particular party, but he considered it his bounden duty to pay the closest attention to the interests of all his constituents. (Hear, hear.)
hr. CAYLEY next addressed the electors, and was cheered by Iis su porters, and frequently interrupted by his opponents. They had had, he said, a glorious battle, and secured a glorious triumph. Spontaneously, with a free heart, and with a hearty strongwill, the independent men of the riding had returned him as their representative, and be felt proud of his noble constituency. (Applause.) lie had had no agents, while his opponents had had district committees, ward committees, agents, and double agents. (Laughter.) He had two messengors to run between his committee-room and the telegraph-office, one copying clerk, and one voter of &5 be brought up to the poll for the prioe of 12d. (Renewed laughter.) This was aU York required of him, they gave him their free and unbought support, and he should bave valued no other. (Hear, hoar.) Ilow had the victory been won ? (A Voice.-" You're Dtsncombe's tool.") He knew Mr. Dundas would make al the ranning at starting; ho therefore vaited, and won in a canter. (" Hear, hear," and A Voice.-" It was lMontaga's tenants.") He urged upon the assembly to look after the register in the next feW years, and not to promise at another election their votes to the first comer. His oppoDents said ie opposed Lord Palmerston. He supported the Premier on the China question, and was anxious to strengthen his Lordship's hands so long as he did his duty. (Eear.) Whatever was bad he wanted to mend, and whatever was good he wished to keep. He would oppose AU "jobs," whether proposed by Whigs-and there are lots of Whig "jobs"-or by Tories, though Tory "jobs" are no longer in the ascendant. They said he voted for Protection; he did so, because he did not like the untaxed foreign labourer to enter into competition with our taxed labourer. (Hear.) He said in 1830 he did not care about protection so long as we had oheap money. By a benoficent Providence we got Australia and California, and that settled the question of free trade. (Hear.)
The Hon. J. C. DuI4nAs said he should, after their decision, retre without reluctance to the privacy from whenco he came, his only regret being that the great principles of which he had hoped to be their index in Parliament would not have so honest a representative. (E'Qar.) If ever there was a time wrhen their two representatives snmi.ht form a very important pJortion of Her Majesty's Opposition it was
on the present o'ccson, and ho baive heo;vud en diliculty in finding room for them upon the Opusosition bnches. (aughter.) He did not consider he had suffered a defeat. e had got a majority of plumpers. From what wvas called their defeat, and from the principles they had upheld, let them gain courage for the future, and be ready on another occasion to carry their standard to the head of the poll. (Cheers.)
A v ote of thanks to the High Sheriff concluded the proceedings.

Mr. CAVENDISsa, after than}ing the electors, expressed a hope that Mr. Cobden amd his party would in time regan seats in the House of Commons. He entertained great respect for some of them, for they were men of undoubted
abilit andcalciatedtodo theountryservice. Theirconduct had, however, given dissatisfaction to the country, and for a time, no doubt, they must feel iL (Cheers) Withrepect to the future, he did not slare in the distrust evined by some with regard to Lord Pahsnerston's probablq short. comnings as a Reformer. Lord Palmerston wau not like ame candidates for pcoputlr favour,..whsowent about the ountry puffing their owit,1ttic4l wars, and promising to do a pzeat many things. mEhere wAs a rather large assortment of thcst hcepgoods osiinul lust now, tobe bad, bebelleyod,at

(L uglter and cheera) Anyman who was desirous of holding the position of First Minister and leader of a Liboraa Government must take heed to econornize as much as was consistent with the maintenance of efficient establishments. and go with the tide in all those social and political reforms which the exigendes of the day and the increasing intelligence of the people required. (Cheers.) As other communities grow in wealth, Intelligence, enterprise, and population, the old decayed boroughs, -with small constituencies, must in tine give place to the new order of things. (Cheers.) The abuses of the Ecclesiastical Coourts oaght to be abolished, and if the Dresent Lord Chan. cellor could not devise a better remedil measure than the one he had introduced the country must insist upon having a Lord Chancellor who could. (Cheem) He (Mr. Cavendih 'was opposed tothe ballot, believing, on the one hand, that it ,was better to exercise the franchise publicly, and, 'on the other hand, that it woulId not affordl the protection its advocates thought.
Mr. THORSNIILL said, spesking generaly, he was a supporter of Lord Palmerston's Government, for he admired the way in which the noble lord had conducted the war when other hands had faUed, and he deserved great credit for the satisfactory manner in which he had brought the contest to a satisfactory termination. He admired, too, the appointments wbich Lord Palmerston had made in the church, good working men, imbued with real Protestant
rinciples, having been selected to fill offices of trust and dignity. (Cheers.) He (Mr. Thornhill) hoped to see a steady ana gradual extension of the franchise and a reduction in the expenditure, as soon as practicable, to peae_
establishments-always, of course, having regard to the efficiency of the two great arms of the national service. (Cheers). He should be glad, also, to see the vexed question of church-rates amicably and equably settled; and he was s strong advocate for the abolition of the Ecoleslastical Courts, and the rendering of greater facilities for the transfer of landed property. (Cheers.) He was decidedly in favour of a large measure of education for the people He prornised the electors that his best energies should be directed to the promotion of the general interests of the county. (Loud cheers.)
On the motion of Mr. Cavendish, seconded by Mr. Thornbill, thanks were voted to the Sheriff, and after three cheers for Lord Palmer8ton and three for the Queen the proceedings terminated,

Sir A?NDREw AG.NZEw in the course of his addres, said that Lord Palmerston's appeal to the country had been answered by the constituencies in a way which could leave no doubt a8to their approval of his policy on the question which had led to the dissolution. He ridiculed the politics of the Manchester school, and condemned the tactics of the pasty eallng themselves Peelites or Liberal Conservatives, observing of Toryism that, even in its present state of development, it was 200 years behind the time. He would give an independent support to Lord Palmerston's Government. He was not opposed to an extension of the suffrage, and would support a new Registration Bill for the counties. He pointed out the fact that Dissenting ministers, though living in good houses and with fixed salaries like clergymen of the established church, were disqualied from voting, aund said that were a measure not introduced to do awav with that disqualification he would be inclined to introduce one hirself. He would vote for opening Un the parish schools and abolishing teats. He thought Lord Elcho s proposed Tol BiU a bad measure.

DUhBLIN Uz'IVExSITY.-The long but by no means un Interesting contest closed on Saturday, Mr. Wilson iD. sisted on keeping the booths open to the last moment allowable by law, Mr. Lawson's friends and admirers are not dispirited by the result, and even his bitterest opponents admit that it would have been difficult to select a candidate better qualified to dissipate the tradi tional prejudices which mrust be encountered by any one professing the broad views put forward in the address of Mr. Lawson, and unflinchingly sustained in the rdmirable speech delivered on the day of nomination. The gross number poUed for Lawson fell something short of the late Professor M'Caqagh's supporters wben,inI847,that lamentedgentlemanmadeaneffortto open the borough. But the cases are not paralleL As a scholar, 3dr. M'Cullagh had a European fame to rest upon, and, unlike Dlr. Lawson, he did not startle the learned constituency by the enunciation of Liberal and progressive principles, the very sound of which was, perhaps, heard for the first time since old Trinity received its charter of incorporation. Ten years since Mr. Spooner was comparatively in the shade, and it was no slight feat of daring in these later days for a candidate seeking the representation of the Dublin University to set himself in opoositionte nine-tenths of the Irish clergy, and boldly to insist upon the injustice of tampering with an Act of Settlement which, however distasteful, should be regarded as final. Maynooth was the rock on which Mr. Lawson suffered shipwreck. Had he been leas honest and explicit on this point there is no doubt whatever that his position at the final close of the poll would have augured better for future success than it did at this his first attempt at "social revolution" within the walls of Trinity College.
GALW,AY (CorxTY).-An extremely sharp contest is exTected for one of the seats, Sir Thomas Burke being considered quite safe for the other. The local Roman Catholic journals, although speaking under restraint, are evidently dissatisfied with Captain BeUelw, his archiepiscopal absolution notwithstanding. The Vindicato' sys,-" Both gentlemen are strongly backed by tho Catholic clergy. If Captain Bellow counts on the Archbishop of Tuam, tr. Gregory has the Bishop of Kilmacduagh on his side. The second order of the clergy is equally divided, both candidates possessing in its ranks zealous friends, political and
Irsonal. If Captain Bellew be well received in TuamI Mr Gregory is as satisfactorily welcomed in Gort' while among the great body of freeholders his frank and generous manner, accompanied by the possession of wellknown pubhc abilities, renderse hm deservedly popular." The MlfercuIy's leanings are stil less disguised:-"Were we
to consider talents of the highest ordep powers of mind of a highly acute type, an aptness for Parliamentary debate
and tactici, a rich and classical style of oratory, and an astonishing ability and readiness of replyinthediscussion of any question which may chance to fal under debate, as the proper and best qualification for a member of Parliament, we sbould bave no hesitation in pointing out Mr. Gregory as a 'fit and proper Person' to revresent not only Gaway, but any county i the kIngdom --but amid the condlict of opiniols which seemas to prevaii in this case we should be slow to speak dogmatically in a matter of such deep, of such paramount importance."
LONGFORD (CouNTYv). - The Fr'eeman's Journal announces that Mr. HE G. Hughes, ex-Solicitor-General, issued an address on Sunday, intimating his retirement from the 'candidature of the county. The learned gentleman states that he has not been weeU treated by the colleague chosen in conjunction with him by the club, and attributes his reiignatio principally to this cause. The other candidates are 0-4one GreviUe, the late member, and Colonel lenry White, both Lierals.

" It canuot be denied (says Dr. Burke) that this sysem of I Iude.

Only think of the vailting ambition of Mr. George HenryMoore. He expectshtat he sbould be at once raised to a lofty and confidential positlon by the Catholio people of Irelsnd-he who only the other day, In order to carry his point here, made 'a league, offtensive ad defensyv:,' with thbir rworn enemies, the Donoughmores, the Glengails and the Hawardens, the AttUia of Tipperary. and the uniecling extermintors t rom their estates ot almost aU the Catholi cotters and farmer3 who held under them.

Drury-Lane Theatre.
DBURY-LANE ¢HEATBB.
To make up for the absence of dramatic exhibitions in Passion-week there is enough of music and to spare. The metropolis during five days will have an absolute surfeit of harmonious entertainments. The most Important series of performances announced to celebrate the present anniversary commenced last night, in Drury-lane Theatre, with a grand concert, vocal and instrnmental, under the name and direction of Mr. Alfred Mellon, " our English Costa," as his admirers call him, and not without a good show of reason. This was really a "grand" concert, since the prominent attraction was a numerous and efficient orchestra, without the aid of which tho term "grand" applied to musical entertainments generaly is simply absurd. The programme was selected with a view to propitiate all tastes, from the high standard set up by connoisseurs to the humble appreciation of the most on. initiated lovers of the " Divine art." The band comprised, not only the members of the Orchestral Union-Mr. Mellon's own-but the most renowned solo players attached to the staff of M. Jullien. It was therefore not surprising that the instrumental performers should have elicited unanimous approvaL
The concert began with Mr. Mellon's overture, entitled Margur-it, a composition to the dashing and energetic chaxacter of which we have already borne testimony. It was executed with wonderful precision, and wamrly applauded by the audience.
The next piece was Mendelssohn's vigorous and charaote. ristic Rondo in B flat for pianoforte with orchestral accom paniments-an early work, to which its composer was ex. tremely partial, but which, nevertheless, has hitherto failed to attain a position equivalent to that allottedfrom the ortset, in the universal estimation of classical pianists, to the two concertos, although its merits are in no way inferior. Mendelssohn himself was wont to execute this rondo with that combination of playfulness, grace, and impetuosity which imparted so peculiar and varied a charm to his performances, and placed him by universal consent at the head of imaginative and intellectual pianists. To him music was a genuine language, au eloquent means of poetical expression, which he had the rare secret of employing vith a fancy truly inexhaustible. Whatever compositions he essayed in public-whether his own or another's -he endowed with an individuality of style and colour. ing that distinguished them from everything else. Mendelssohn was, in the strongest sense of the term, an " eclectic" performer ; but his pianoforte.play. ing was not merely a dexterous and surprising feat of mechanical skill; it was a trne manifestation of genius, one of those media through which his ardent nature, his very original and thoughful turn of mind, became revealed. When we add that Miss Arabelia Goddard performed the rondo in B flat as nearly as possible in the man. ner of its composer-with the same animnaion and enthusiasm, the same uncompromising rapidity, united to unerring mechanism, and that command of the gradations of tone and accent which separatescantilena from brarura,whileimpart. ing vocal charm to the one and fire to the other-we have said enough to prove that the gifted young pianist-who seems to have a whole library of the works of great mastersinher head and in her fingers-worthily accomplished the task she had undertaken, and succeeded in doing honour both to herself and to the music. The rondo was listened towith profound interest, and produced a real sensation.
Another performance of extraordinary merit was that of a selection from Beethoven's ninth (" choral ") symphony, of which the adagio and schehwo were produced. The only objection that could be made to this irreproachable display of orchestral execution-which the Paris Conserratoire could n ot have surpassed-was attributable to the plan adopted by the conductor of reversing the order in which Beethoven himself had placed the two movements (the scherzo comiDg.hirst in the score). But this, it may be reasonably insisted, when separating them from the test of the work, is unavoidable- since nothing less exciting than the unexampled succession of choral movements that bring the grandest of Beethoven's symphonies to a climax could effectively come after such an incomparable schierzo.
Verdi's aria di bravura-" Tacea la notte" (17 Trovaatorc) -cleverly as it was sung byMissLouisaVinning, was hardly iii place in such company. It was like bringing forward a Traviata in the presence of a Fiddio. Mr. Melon strangely departed from the canons of good taste-for the observance of which he has always been noted-when the idea seized him of placing Verdi tinsel between Mendelssohn and Beethoven gold. *' Revenge Timotheus cried," from Handel's Alezande-'s Feast, and Schubert's "Wanderer" -both ofthem admirably sung by Mr. Winn, and the last extremely we31 accompanied on the pianoforte by Signor Fosai-were in far better keepiing. The first part terminated with a splendid performance of the overture to Guitlaume Tdl, the last movement of which was uproariously redemanded.
The second part commenced with the famous Trozato,rc "selection"-reudered promminent by the ingenious solo playing of Messrs. Pratten, Lavigne, Lazarus, Koenig, and
ugbes on the flute, oboe, clarinet, cornet, and ophicleidewhich has so often been applauded at the concerts of A. Jullien. After this should properly have come Miss Vinnings a-ia from the same opera, instead of between the Rondo of Mendelssohn and the symphony of Beethoven. The renainder of the concert included one of the most popular morceacux de danse of the day-the Romanoff Valse of &I. H. Laurent--and a variety of lighter pieces, vocal and instrumental. The whole performance afforded unqualified satisfaction, and the series of concerts could not have begun more auspiciously.
Concerts For The People.-The 28th Monday
GONICRTS FOlB TT1 PEOPLE.-The 28th Monday Evening Concert (of the St. Martin's-haU series) was bonoured last night by the presence of the Lord and Lady hia oress, accompanied by the Sheriffs and lUnder-SheriS of London and Middlesex, who attended and paid great attention to the performances. It was a great event for the managers of these entertainments, who must naturally find it (at the prices) rather dicficult to make both ends meet. The programme on this occasion comprised a seleotion of sacred music, in which Mlisses Birch, Augpsta Man. ning. and Clara Mackenzie, Madame Bassano, Messrs. Daw son, Seymnour, and the london Vocal Union, took part. Between the parts hlr. Adoiphus Francis read one of the most interesting and pathetic chapters from Mr. Dickenes (Xd CurioAty/ Shaop. The whole entertainment was received with enthusuasm by a crowded audience.
MB. CASE'S COoNCEBT.-The annual combination of singers and players, far too numerous to mention, to which lr. Case has for some time accustomed his friends, took place last nieht at Exeter-baDl, when a programme of something under DO pieces was gone through. Our opinion cf these entertainments has by no mneRns changed. That they attract a certain portion of the public there can be no doubt, but that they either amuse or instruct in the end we are not prepared to admit. To criticize such a concert as that of bt night would be a waste of ink; and as from an rrtistic point of view it could possibly offer nothing to comment upon, our musical 7eaders will sustain no los by the bare fact of its having taken plaoe being announced In a pargraph. The hail was not nearly so crowded as last year - which encourges a hope that the common aense of tbe public is beginning to awake to the utter absurdity of thwe zo-ealled "monster concerts,"
The New Parliament.
THE NEW PARLIAMENT.
MEMBERS RETURNED.
The elections for the English and Welsh boroughs are now completed, and the results have appeared in our columns. The opinion of the country has been so strongly pronounced upon the question of the Chinese vote in the last Parliament that it is unnecessary to continue the application of that test to the members of the new House of Commons; we therefore append a list of the members returned by English and Welsh counties and Irish and Scotch constituencies, arranged according to their general political opinions. Radicals are ineluded among the Liberals, and the members of the "Irish Independent party" are ranked as they usually vote-with the Conservatives. The late members who have been defeated, or have not presented themselves for re-election, are marked in Italics:-
To The Editor Of The Times.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIrMES.
Sir, -Allow me to submit the following case to the public through the medium of your powerful journal :_
At the spring asRizes, held in a certain town not 100 miles from the Border, a man, who was also a poacher, wss tried for the murder of the gamekeeper of the high sheriff of the county ; he was, however, acquitted of the murder, and found guilty of manslaughter, and sentenced to be
On the part of the prosecution a witness was brought forward whose evidence, had it been accepted, would have prloveld thed prisoner to have committed a deliberate and
This witness was very cleverly cross-examined by the learned counsel for the defence, but without producing the slightest effect on or alteration in his statement. In his address to the jury the learned gentleman contended that this witness's evidence was utterly unworthy of belief; that he had concocted it in order to get a reward that had been offered for the detection of the prisoner. The judge took the same view of the case in summing up, and said that be (the witness) ought to be indicted for perjury. The jury accordingly rejected the evidence of this important witness, amd found the prisoner guilty of manslaughter.
After this verdict, coupled with the strong expressions the judge made use of, the witness felt that his character was blasted for life, unless he made some effort to prove that his statement was correct.
He accordingly went to the nearest town to the scene of the murder, taking with him several witnesses, and there proved to the entire satisfaction of the magistrates that every word he had said was true; he explained to them that he had mentioned to several people the substance of the evidence he gave in court some days before any reward hAi been heard of.
Since the trial the witness has lost his place (his late master being an uncle of the prisoner's) and he is at present in very distressed circumstances, as, owing to the stain on his character, he is unable to obtain employment.
Now, Sir, the moral that I draw from this case is simply this,-that, where a witness's evidence is thus rejected, and his character in consequence blasted, the said witness ought to be allowed to appeal, and, that havin proved the truth of his statements, his character should be publiely declared free from stain; or else if witnesses are to have no redress, if their prospects in life are to be destroyed in this way, why the consequence will be that in cases involvirn capital punishmnents, it will be found that men will bhve uncommonly short memories, and will prefer ving no evidence at all to telling the truth and losing their charaters for life.
1 remrin. your obedient seyvxn+,
A HARD CASE.

SACRILEGE AT DEPTFORD.-Only a few months
SACR,IoF AT DErrFoRD.-Only a few months go we had to annonnce the robbery of cominanion.plate from the ancient church of St. Nicholas, Deptford, an appeal for contributions to replace the plate being still in circulation. We have now the sad task again to record the robbery of tho whole of the plate (amounting to upwards of 200. worth) from the church of St. Paul's, Deptford, which wa effected on the night of the 1st int. On the occasion of the robbery of St. Nicholas church the churchwar. dens of this parish took extra precautions to secure the chest containing the plate, and, in Addition, the policeman on duty was required to go throngh the churchyard at least once in every hour. This he did not do, and it was not till the next man went his rounds that the loss was found out, when notice was at once given to the churchwarden. Great violenc3e was used by the thieves to effect their purpose, the principal entrance door to the chuch being much battered Prom tho manner in which the chest was secured at least for men must have been engaed in its removaL The in. babitants complain of the inefficient protection afforded by the police, and it i3 in contemplation to niemorializ& Sir George Grey on the subject.-GreecnAh Prec Press.

LONDOr, TUESDAY, APRIL 7, 1857.
On what has the General Election turned ? On this point the political critics, always ingenious, and always hard to be pleased, have supplied us with an abundanice of negatives. The Election has not turned on the support of Government, stil less, we are assured, on attachment to Lord. PALME1:BSTON. It has not turned upon Liberalisni or any other isn. Ihe very last thing it has turned upon, or could possibly turn upon, we axe now told, is the Chinese war. It is absolutely inconceivable, we read as we write, that a single rational vote can have been affected by any opinion about YEni or BowrtixG, aud no one but a knave or a fool -would suggest such a farfetched idea. Well ; what if wve should grant aU this and more? What if we should admit that the Election, like the decisions of most individual minds, has not tturned on any one point, or any consideration that the mind is quite conscious of ? It is rarely that a man knows all his own reasons,-much less can anybody else know them for him. So let us give lip all this bard reasoning upon electoral figures. We will not taunt our old antagonists with any evident moral which they must be very blind indeed not to see in the result. Let us suppose the General Election to have been a spontaneous, instinctive, almost unconscious act-an act of that natural character that we ascribe to the old English peasant, or the old English yeoman, or the old English gentleman, or any example of fine moral vegetation. Indeed, why should we object to this view of the case, which we honestly believe to have a great deal of truth in it ? We never stood up for the logical consistency of the British people; their nature is too mixed, their sympathiez too various, their interests too multifarious, for that. What we do maintain, and have always maintained, is the soundness of their heart, the 'rigour of their common sense, anud the promptness of their reaction from occasional follies and extrav&gances. It is not we who have invited the peopl9 of England to read all through the Blue-book about the Arrow, or to ransack half a century's Hansard for the life of Lord PxsAnsroN. It is not we who have narrowed the issue of this Election. But when it has been loudly aserted and triumphantly proved that the Election has had notbing to do with, Government or lord PA1'snmwecx, or Liberalis=> or China, or any-
thing else. iL articular, we, vsuturo to &sk whli.
Las it had to do with I As the Senior Wrangler zaid of Paradise Lost, pcrhaps it proves nothing, -nothing in a mathematical way. Still, we cannot help having our thoughts about it. We cannot lelp thinking differently of the rejection of a score ar two of particular names than we should have -dong of their election.
But, to humour our critics as far as we possibly -can consistently with truth, we 'will take the most ,negative view of the Election. Let it prove nothing for Government, for the press, or for the -austings. We 'will readily grant that it has gone maot so much upon names, or questions, or party -cries, though these may have told in some -cases, as upon the existing natural feelings of the -country, irrespective of the topics of the day. The subject of the vote of censure in the lHouse of 4,ommons being frivolous and vexatious, being mow a matter of history and utterly inpractical, it -lmost disappeared before the people caine to the ,poll, and when they actually voted they voted by the force of their siumple, lhonest natures, -according to moral preferences, to old leanings, and pristine traditions, and all sorts of indescribable influences. For several Elections past it has not been so, as there vere then certain conspicuous names, or prominent doctrines, -or particular measures, which Ministers, or classes, -or leagues took care to keer, before the public, -and compel every man to declare himself upon. 'This has been the custom11 latterly, and the ,General Elections have been very manifestly the decision of the people on Parliamentary Reform, -or the Corn Laws, or some other measure -or man of the day. But in this Election it is mot so. There has been just enough of a pretence -to withdraw the public attention from other questiona of all kinds, just as you are more likely to see a picture of British character at a fair, or a boat race, or a street performance, than at a place -of worship or a lecture-room. YEn and Bowivro hbave been as unimportant in the business as DiDo,
or RIEBECCA, or the Queeni of SHIEBA in CLAUDE'S
pictures; they give a name and they fix the date -of the affair, but that is all. Some genlemen 'who are for ever talking or writing against us, and always using the hardest words, of course in the purest charity, must admit that we are quite taking the bread out of their mouths, and that this is precisely their own line about this Election in answer to a certain stiff, logical cliaracter, which, as they suppose, we have tried to force upon it. But when the Election is thus denuded of its artificial character, and taken simply as the unpolitical, unbiassed, unreflecting, -altogether unsophistical utterance of the people, what are 'we to say of the returns of the county constitu-encies? If the view of the Election which we Teadily adopt from our opponents, and have, indeed, anticipated them in forming, applies to the whole, it applies more especially to those indigenous 'bodies, those patriarchal communities, the county electors. The county changes, too, if not so -numerous, are even more remarkable tlian those for the boroughs.
Here, then, is the question in a very simple formn-lHow is it tbat, not to speak of the boroughs, even the siruple folk of the counties, caring nothing -about China and not much for PALAIZMTaO., have -nevertheless ousted more than 20 members hitherto -classed as Conservatives 1 Sone of the counties, indeed, are by no means purely agricultural; but they were agricultural enough to return " Protec* tionist members before, and have not returned +hem now. West Kent, we see to-day, has returned tyro Liberals; and in Cambridgeshire, where the -contest was niot between Liberal and Conservative, the aristocratic " farmers' friend" lias been beaten by the farmer himself. The plain inference is that the county constituencies, like the rest, have been thlrown on themselves, There has been a singular absence of controversy or cry. That controversy, that cry of " Protection" that has been worked with so much success for near twenty years, has altogEtlber gone out. Not a word has been said about it since the Dissolution. The mcni who had been trading upon popular ignorance and selfishness bor these twenty years, who undertook to secure Protection, and who declared it to be necessary to agricultural success, as weU as to the welfare of the country, have been ,convicted at every turn. They could not secure Protection, and it bas been found mot only unnecessary, but even injurious. The -country thrives better without it ; the farmer, the labourer, and the landlord ; the producer ancd the consumer; the agriculturist, the manufacturer, and the merchant, all have thririen far more since the day that was to rain all of thema than they had ever done before. This bubble, then, is burst. Protection is exploded from Parliament and from the hustinigs. The farmers have been released from their delusion, and, not finding in the present state of public affairs any question to divide them, have faUen back ca. their old selves. They are what they were thirty years ago. Then they were some Tories, some Whis, some had Tory landlords, some had Whig landlords,-old natural differences, made by birth, by education, by locality, or connexion. They have now simply reverted te these old variations. Theufarnnes of Norfolk used to be Wllhiggislh, and they have now returned three Liberal members. Then, has always been a certain proportion of the VVhig element in Berkshire, aid it has returned one Liberal out of three. It is the same in Bedfordshire and in Hertfordshire. Here, then, is the true character of this Election. In the absence of any very torturing coutroversy, or any constraining motive, the British people have gone back to what they were some thirty years ago, and the result has beecn disastrous to all the three sections that have lived on the recent con- troversy ; - Protectionists, Peelites, and Leaguers
have alike disappeared from the scene. They have done their work, and aU that *was wanted was some trivial occasion for appealing to the people, witlhout allowing the question of Free Trnde to be dragged in either by one side or the other. Comminsioner YEUi has answered this purpose, and the result is a Parliament 'which does not perhaps care much about China, but which has wholly forgotten the Corn Lawvs.
It is a melancholy fact that Parish Relief in
It is a melancholy faet thatl Parish Relief in this country leaves a large mass of poor unprovided for. This is no fault of the system, because the law of Parish Relief does as much as law can possibly do,-it insures a man relief from his parish if lie asks for it. No law can do more than this. But the fact is that a large mass will not ask for it; and the reason why they wiU not ask for it is that they will not submit to the local restrictions of the system. Every man, woman, and child in this country has a parish, and they have only to go there to obtain sufficient food and sufficient clothing to prevent them from perishina either of hunger or cold; but multitudes will not go there, and no power on earth can make tbem. They hate the hopeless confinement of the workhouse, they brave weather, hunger, and the black or susPicion3 looks that all the world throws upon them, they truat to chanee, and to something or other turning up day after day, rather than *msbmit to an niform life or underfed idleness. No system can prevent the growth of a populatiotn *of this kind, az a Bort of natiural though morbid excrescence upon it. What are you to do, then, with this extraparochial mass I It is entirely by their own fault that they are thus outside the system, but there they are, they exist, and
their existence is a claim upon you by the common law of the land. No matter how worthless, how idle, how abandoned they may be, you must keep them from starving.
This is now becoming a serious metropolitan question. The class just described naturally infests the metropolis, as the principal scene of "1 casual" life, where such low chances and opportunities as this form of life depends upon are thickest coLlected. Anud, besides this permanent class of " casuals," the metropolis also naturally collects a large iumber of temporary ones-persons who are in a state of transition from one situation and employment to anotlser, and in the meantime want assistance, while at the same time it would be out of their way altogether to go to their parishes for it. This whole class has been hitherto provided for by " casual wards," attached to the different Metropolitan 'Unions. But it appears now that these wards have given a very insufficient relief. According to the present system it is only a contest of astuteness between the several Metropolitan Unions how little relief they can give. Their wards are placed two or three miles away from the city, on purpose, apparently, to be out of reach of the class they are professedly intended for. Nor are we to be much surprised at this. The fact of the Poor Law attests the charity of the nation as a whole, but when it comes to deciding our several shares of the burden of charity, then the principle of charity ceases, and that of justice comes in; and, when justice comes in, then comes in evasion of justice too. Then commences parochial pettifogging and cunning, one parish trying to shove its burden upon another, and each only aiming at getting off wvith as little expense as possible. It becomes a matter of duty with guardians and parish officers to reduce the share which their own parish has to bear of the general burden to the smallest amount. They are, according to popular notions, only doing justice to the locality whose interests they represent in doing so. It is no inconsistency, then, but only the natural working of the system, that a nation which is charitable on the whole should be jealous of its purse in all its parts and divisions, because it is the great burden of the self-imposed national charity which obliges us to be vigilant as to the share which we undertake of it. In the present instance the vigilance of the local purse appears to have run into a real evasion of the law.
How is such an evil to be remedied? We answer, by instituting for this particular purpose a common purse, instead of a local one -a metropolitan fund, or a fund to which all the iMetropolitan Unions should contribute, instead of separate funds maintained by each Union singly. Let there be centrally situated " casual wards," supported by all the Metropolitan Unions in common. Will it be said that this is a step in the direction of a metropolitan rate instead of a parochial one for the relief of the poor ? We answer that whatever conunon rating is involved in this plan is, at any rate, only for a specific object-viz., the relief of the houseless and casual poor, and does not extend to the general subject-matter of the Poor Law. Btut such a plan would not, in fact, involve metropolitan rating even for this specific object, because, though the fund would be a metropolitan one, each Union might contribute to it according to its size ; nor would it even involve IJnional rating, because each parish might contribute in its proper ratio to the Union's share of the common fund. However, if such a plan even did lead to an enlargement of the area of rating for the general relief of the poor, we are not prepared to say that within certain limits we should object to it. The great danger of extending the area of rating is that you diminish the stimulus to economy, because the effects of extravagance are thrown over a larger surface, and your local or parish officer-whom you must have, in some shape, under any system, because he alone knows anything about the local poor-only raises slightly by indiscriminate relief to his ov.-n district poor a general poor-rate level. But so long as you keep your area. within such limits as preserve the proper stimulus to economy we see no great harm in an enlargement of it, and it wonld have the advantage, in mauy cases, of greater justice and fairness. Our " EAsT-FND " INM-31PtENT" had undoubtedly something to urge on this head. Nobody can maintain the abstract justice of a system in which some parishes are almost crushed by the Poor Law and others are hardly touched by it. NVe only submit to it, or call on others to submit to it, as the better of two alternatives. Will you have inequality in the system of rating, or will you have the boundless extravagance which a national rate would produce? But within certain limits an enlargement of the area of rating might be a gain to just;ce and no loss to economy. At any rate, for the specific object of which we are now speaking-the relief of the casual poor-a Unional as distinguished from a parochial area of rating would be no great inroad upon the existing system.
This morning our readers are indulged with
This morning our readers are indulged with another glimpse into the arts, mysteries, and antidotes of Witcheraft, as believed, if not practised, in England in the year of grace 1857. For the authority of the communication we can entirely vouch, and its interest is considerable, not merely as authenticating the nature of the delusions still culrrent in the country, but more especially as exhibiting the phase which these persuasions assume in the case of respectable persons and wellregulated parishes. The truth is, we fear, that much of the material out of which the follies and barbarities of the 17th century were constructed exists to the present day, and if the results are less deplorable it is owing rather to better administration than superior enlightenment. The examiple now given is supplied by the evidence and arguments of a yeoman farmer-well-couducted, pretty weUl to do, and possessed of at least as much religious and general knowledge as falls usually to the lot of his class. Ilis wife being ill, he betakes himself to a neighbouring magistrate, relates his affiction, attributes it to the machinations of a certain witch, and applies for the magistrate's warrant to have her " proved," according to the use and practice of our forefathers. The mention of the case in the neighbourhood brings out other allusions, anecdotes, and confessions, until at length it becomes plaln enough that the applicant's opinions on this subject represent pretty nearly the private creed of the -whole parish.
MIr. DisrAui was certainly wrong in saying that the Desert was the only place for purity of tradition. No Egyptian necromancers could have preserved their mysteries more faithfully than the inhabitants of this British county. The principles and maxims disclosed are of the real genuine stamp, unimpeachable in their antiquity, unimpaired in their proportions, unadulterated in tieir folly. The " proving" of the witch is the true old trial, without cross or blemish-a real Dnvm's ordeal. Innocence of ordinary crimes used to be tested in early days by appeals to the immediate agency of PROVIDENCE, so that fire was expected not to burn, or blows to hurt, in the case of a person unjustly accused. But innocence of Witchcraft was proved by an inversion of the test. The agency here provoked was that of the DBVL, and if impunity ensued the verdict waa that of conviction, not of acquittal, since the Prince of Darkness w?A held to have betrayed hia
sympathies in the protection of his own. The unfortunate consequence of these assumptions was that the incriminated party had no chance of escape either way. In the common ordeal, or appeal to MAvEN, safety in the experiment brought safety altogether; but in the proof of Witchcraft safety in the trial brought destruction afterwards, and acquittal was only established by death in the process. A reputed witch was thrown into the water. As a human being in such case would usually sink and perish, it was held as evidence of diabolical support if the accused was found to sw,im, and the stake awaited her accordingly; if no such aid was forthcoming she went to the bottom in the odour of innocence, and there remained. The reader will discern in the stories now set before him with what remarkable fidelity this theory has been preserved. it is only in the touches of humanity and public order that the ideas of the 19th century peep out. The farmer still desires to have the witch " swum," but he applies first for a magistrate's sanction, and would do it tenderly and with precautions, so as " not to " hurt her." Another notable persuasion of the good old times was to the effect that these presumed dealers with the DEvm were in the habit of suckling young imps at certain abnonnal teats, presenting the appearance of moles on the skin. The method of diagnosis on these occasions consisted in probing the moles to the quick with sharppointed bradawls; and the famous HoprEis, the Witchfinder, was renowned for the peculiar dexterity of his manipulation. We suspect that the vitality of this tradition also may be detected in one of the requests preferred by the farmer to the magistrate.
There is little novelty in any of the symptoms detailed as evincing the agency in question. As are tlhe witches, so is their work-the veritable reproduction of ages long past. It would be almost a startling piece of testimony to find some entirely new feature or apparition, but, unluckily, nobody ever sees or hears anything except what tradition represents as being seen or heard under such circumstances. The most curious part of the. statements now published consists, we tninlk, in the evidence of the counterpart traditions-traditions containing antidotes to witchery, which are hoarded and handed down like family recipes. In introducing one of these to the magistrate's notice the farmer observed, in a philosophic tone, " These, "you see, Sir, are little schemes which go from one "generation to another. There is always some"thing to be learned out of the weakest and " ignorantest." The " little scheme" produced on the present occasion from this repository of lore consisted in taking some hairs from the " noddle" of the bewitched woman's neck, some parings of her nails, and some nails from a horseshoe, and putting the whole together in a bottle on the fire. W.hen the bottle bursts the experimenters look out of window, and there the guilty witch or wizard will be seen standing before them. Nor was this the only counter-spell available. When the evil-disposed person had been thus identified there were moans of getting rid of her very simply indeed. The impulse of theDxvu. would drive her to the house she was afflicting, and it was only necessary to refuse all speech of her to send her back to her own home to die. One case, it wil be seen,was related in which the actual employment of this method with a fuU and due result was said to have occurred. In point of fact, if a household was but in possession of the proper knowledge, and resolute in applying it, it seems to us as if witches would get a good deal the worst of the game.
One highly natural but exceedingly strildng feature in the discourse here put before us is the clashing and discord of ideas produced in the conflict between delusions of the 17th century and realities of the 19th. It is hard to say which appears the strongest-faith in spells or belief in parochial government. Witches are spoken of one minute as if they were horn children of the DEVIL, and the next as if they were poachers or tramps. The farmer had argued with the magistrate about the Witch of E-NDoi and about Jewish demoniacs, but when it came to the push, and as a last resort, he asks whether a man who " has to pay the rates and taxes, hard " and fast," ought to be bothered inthis kind of way? SATAN might be roaring and ramping about, but he couldn't be stronger than the Squire. " Sir, if "our Squire knew that there was any such bad "things as Witchcraft about, he wotUd have it "altered." Even in the case of the very witch believed to be at work the final appeal shows the ratepayer triumphart over the victim of superstition. EHe had been pleading very hard for the swimming and the proving-for the pond and the rope; but at last he says, " Couldn't you "have her hitched off to the Union? Ttra might "be a benefit 1" We shouldn't wonder if it proved as hard a trial as any.
It is horrifying to thlink of the cruelties which in former times were practised under the influence of persuasions like these, when poor unhappy creatures, almost always aged and helpless, were liable to treatment of the most barbarous description on charges which could always be made and could hardly be disproved. In the present case our informant tells us that the accused woman is harmless, respectable, and too infirm to stir much from her cottage, while the woman thought to be bewitched is evidently labouring under aberration of mind. Yet this, we dare say, is the type of many a case attended in days gone by with atrocities too terrible to be thought of. In this department, however, of the subject matters stand on a pretty good footing; nor is there much danger that Witchcraft can involve anything worse than fraud or folly so long as men of charity and intelligence, like our correspondent and his colleagues, can temper the superstition of their neighbourhoods by advice and superintendence. For a more radical cure we must look to education, and such examples as we have recently given ought to teach us more strongly than any arguments how urgently progress is required.

Bythe RoyalMail steamship Amerfica, Captain Wicknan, we have advices from Boston to the 25th ult., and ew York, by telegraph ri4 Halifax, to the 26th. She brings no specie.
The Africa arrived at New York on the 24th ult., after a very boisterous passage. She had $200,000 Bpecie on freight.
The screw steamship Alps had arrived at Boston.
On the 4th inst., at 9 a.m., the America passed the United States' mail steamship Ericsson, hence for New York.
The New York Heraldl says
" We are informed that the rejection of the paroel of treaties lately negotiated at Mexico. under the auspices of President Pierce, by our M1inister, Mr. Forsyth, had been followed up by our preseDt Cabinet witbi the draught of a new treaty upon the simple basis of money for land. We are further advised that the same messenger who brought the Forsyth treaties from Mexico-Mr. Batterfaeld-his been despateLed back, vid Mobile, to the Mexican capital with the substitute proposed by our new Adninistration. Another feature of the treaty is the proposed establishment of a line of postal steamers between New Orleans and Vera Craz, to run nuder the American flag. In ordinary times and under ordinary circumstances this might justly be considered a business affair, in which Vera Cruz and New Orleans would be almost exclusively interested, but the extraordinary conjuncture of the domestio and exterior perils of Mexico at this crisis makes this professed line of steamers an element of diplomacy of the highest moment to the civilized world. Spain threatens a hostile naval descent upon Vera Cruz. This line of steamers between that city and New Orleans wiUl not only furnish the Mexicans the necessary men and munitions for a successfl defence, but will afford to our Caban Filibusters the facilities, should the occasion serve, for a hostile naval descent from the Mexican coast upon the Island of Cuba, under cover of the Mexican flag, and under aU the securities of a regular war."
The Herald, commenting on Lord Palmerston's defence on the China question, maintains that every British Alinistry would necessarily have pursued the same course in reference to the Chinese question that Lord Palmerston has. The argunents of the leading speakers against the Government were the merest moonshine. Lord Palmerston's reply was perfectly conclusive and unanswerable.
The Herald also announces that the amended DaDas-Clarendon Treaty, in the care of Mr. Ale:aLnder H. Evans, special messenger, leaves Boston in the steamship America for England. It has every reason to believe that Mr. Buchanan feels the deepest interest in the acceptance of the treaty thus modified, and that this fact will be privately communicated to the British Government, together with all needful assurances of the good faith which hasactuatedthe American Senate and Cabinet in the modificationxs proposed.
It was reported that despatches had been received fromn the United States' Commissioners, Alorse and Bonlin, relinquishingthe hope of a peaceable adjustment of the difficulties with Granada, and that force will therefore be necessary.
The Bank of Newcastle at Pittsburgh had suspended, and the cashier was reported to have absconded.
Further disturbances were anticipated in Kansas in the event of the Government not taking active measures. Governor Geary's resignation had not yet been accepted.
Respecting the railway accident near Hamilton (Canada), we learn that the engine had been raised. Everything went to show that the axle broke on the bridge or very near it, and that the fall of the bridge was from the concussion. The bridge was tested with three heavy English engines, and hardly any vibration was perceptible.
Advices from Havannah report that the guano in the island south of Cuba was of remarkable richness and the quantity inexhaustible, an assertion which, considering the latitude of the place, must be received with caution, though the reports as to the
quality were from commissioners sent by General a Conchs. Sugars continued to advance. Exchange on London, 5 to 5i per cent. pm.
From St. Domingo we learn that President Baez had announced an armistice of two years with Souloque of IHayti. Negotiations had been opened at Madrid with respect to the difiiculty with regard to the naturalization of Spaniards.
The accounts from the Bahamas mention that the Governor sent a message to the Legislature, in which he alluded to a report made by the French Consular agent to the underwriters on the"spoil system," as he termed it, of the wreckers. His Exceltency says-The Governor informed Count Persigny that it was possible that a consular agent himself moight be engaged in wrecking, and perhaps participated in the spoil so graphically described in the statement of the French underwriters.
Smith, late Receiver-General and Treasurer of the Bahamas, had been tried and found guilty for embezzling certain public moneys, and sentenced to two years' imprisonment with hard labour.
The Governor of Vcnezuela, in his annual address to the Legislature, announces that the European debts of the Republic would soon be satisfactorily arranged, although the balance-sheet of the Treasury exhibits a deficiency. Monagas had intimated his desire to retire from the Presidency. The papers contain a decree of General Vivanco, of Peru, declaring that
"The house of BaTreda and Brother has not only not acknowledged the authority of this Government, being, as itis, its consignees, as the cossessor of the guano do. posits, but has oven committed the disrespect of not answering the official communications that have been addressed to it through the Miristry.General. That the Government cannot and should not tolerate that Peruvian subjects should maintain a hostile position towards it, supplying at the same time resources to the enemy. I therefore decree as follows:-
" Art. 1. The free exportation of guano to the United States of America is declared.
"2. From to-day and for the tern of 30 days proositions will be admitted for the exportation of guano from the Chincha Islands to any part of the globe, excepting the united kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the French Empire."
At New York on the 23d the Bank statement presented no material change. The loans were at a higher figure than rt any previous date. In stocks the transactions were not as heavy as usual. Owing to the issue of additional shares of Illinois Central prices had declined from 138 to 131 ;. In railway shares the tendency was downwards.
Cotton was firmer, with a strong tendency upward; buy-<rs had the advantage to the extent of about Ac. to jc.
Owing to a decrease of receipts in the South, flour, wheat, and corn were very dull, at a decline.
Freights to Liverpool further advanced.
At New York on the evening of the 24th ashes were lower. Cotton firm-sales 3,000 bales.
Flour and grain very unsettled, at lower prices.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I can corroborate the statement in The Times of yesterday with respect to the estimation in which our hinister and Lady 'Wodehouse are held at St. Petersburg. I have this day received a letter from one of the most Muscovite of the Muscovite nobility, in which he says:-
" Lord Wodehouse et my lady sont trcs aim6s chez nous. Ils sont d'une politesse noble qui dispose en leur favetr; et je crois que vos coo.patriotes n'ont pas a; so pl.indre des relations qu'ils cultiveut ohez rous."
As indicative of the feelings with which some true Russians regard the new system of things alluded to in your admirable leader, in the same paper, I may be permitted to add another sentence from the letter of my excellent and able and accomplished friend :-" Jo l'accepte volontiers) speaking of an office under Government,
" Car il est doux et agr6able de travailler dans l'esprit d'un systeme si noble, si conciliant, et si humanitaire que celai qu'a adoptc notre bien aim6 maStre. Dieu donne quo toutes ses intentions aient sucocs, et ne Ini donnent pas des ddseptions, car la bon a cela de p6rilleux que les m.chants en abusent."
It is no harm for us to say "Amen" to that prayer.

Murder Of A Wife And Children.-Yesterday
MIr1DER OF A WYIFB AND CLDEDRN-Yesterday mornins a butcher named Jobn Gibbons, living in Boltonstreet, Liverpool, cut his 'wife's throat, and attempted to nmurder three of his children. The prisoner was examined before the magistrates yesterday, and from the evidence given it appears that he has a stall in St. John's-market. A child 1 years old said that his father and mother both got up yesterday morning about half-past 8 o'clock, and when his mnother had got to the stairs his father went to her and kissed her. He told her to stay in that day, and then he pnUed his hand from his pocket and drew a knife across her tbroat. His father then took his sister, laid her across two chairs, and cut her throat. A euperintendent of police deposed that a child fonr years old was found dead in the house with its throat cut; another child, 1 months, was at the infirmary with its throat cut, seriously; and another child w.as wrounded on the cheekbone. The woman, it was stated by another witness, was the prisoner's second wife, ain wasadrunkard. The prisoner seems to be insane, and is under the delsion that he will be dragged np rnd down the town in an iron cage, Kttended by bands of music. The prisoner was remanded.
CoTrO1N.-GLAsGOV;, April 4.-In tho early part of the week business in our cotton-market was considerably interfered with by the Ptarliamentary eleetion, and the unexpected raising of the Bank rate of disconnt on Thursday has further tended to depress our market.

TO THE EDITOR OF TH1: IMYE.5
Sir,-In aleadingarticle in The Tzaei, of Friday it ix stated that ' participation in bribevy at ligDo eost MIr. Stonor his appointment."
Being assured by my own conscience that 1 am whblly free from the guilt of such participation, and fuly able to deal with the grounds (if such they may be ealld} nupon. vhich the accusation has been most unjustly broughtagainst me, I confidently appeal to your sense of justice,. and regard to public and privateearacter, for the insertion of this communication and the accompanying twoletters of theeminent counsel vwhose names are attached to them, and who appeered before the Sligo Election Committee of 18533
Those letters, and the uncontroverted and uncor+rovertible facts Nwhich appear from them-viz., that the singler letter upon wheich the charge brought against me before the committee rested was never admitted in evidence, arA did not subsequently appear in the printed minutes, and that its terms were wholly different from what the chairman, Mr. Divet, himself afterwards stated them to be, and were fully capaf,le of explanation if required-are I submit
amply sufficient for my justification, and have teen so considered by two Secretaries of State, and by every member of Parliament and othe'r person before whom I have laid them. I may add thbat fr. Divett has most bonourablyexpressed his regret for the speech containing the involuntary misstatement to wvhich I have already referred, and his belief that thaet speech " pressed with undue sererity "
Surely it is contrary to every principle of justice that a man should be condemned, unheard, upon evidence which was never realy before the tribunal in question, to which be has never had an opportunity of replying, and the natura of which has been misunderstood, and consoquently misstated, by the president of that tribunal.
I vill not dwel here upon the important pub3ic considerations nor upon the extreme amount of private hardship involved in my caso, which have secured me the highest and most generous sympathy among men of all parties. The accompanying letters and the foregoing simple statement of facts are sufricient for tho vindication of my character, and upon them I confidently appeal to the verdict of every impartial mind, upon a charge which is neither founded in evidence nor in fact.
My absence, at a distance of 13,000 miles, precluded met from making my defence at the time when my appoittntent was discussed in Parliament and in the press, and fonne, I submit, a valid excuse for my trespassing upon your attention at the present time, and a clear titlo to the sympathy of every ono of your readers who loves or regards justice.
I have the honour to be, Sir,

"London, March 26, 18555
My dear Stonor,-I am ready and happy to add my testimnony to that of many who consider you to bave been most injstly treated in the matter of the Shgo election petition, to eommittee upon which most unwarrantably, in my opinion, travelled out of the record before them and reported you guilty of bribery.
" There was noevidenco wvhatever adducedbeforo tho committee to jutify such a roport. It was founded, I havo reason to believe, upon the supposed contents of a letter written by you to a Mr. Verdon, but this letter was never produced in evidence. It was twice tendered in evidenoe,and on both occasions it was rejected upon an objection raised by myself, as counsel for Mr. Towneley, the then sitting mnember. I am at a loss, therefore, to know upon what grounds the committee reported specialy against you, for there was literally not a tittle of evidenco before the committee to connect you with the bribery of any individual ; and if the letter in question had been admitted in evidence it would in my opinion, in no way have borne out the alegation of bribery against you It would have amounted, at the utmost, to a jn-i7s Jacie case of the slightest description, capable, as we wreU knowr, of an immediate and most satisfactory answer; and I cannot but think that, as matters
ave turned ont, you have been deeply injured by its non-

" 40, Eaton-square, May 3, 1855.
"My dear Sir.-I have readthe minutes of evidence given beforo the Sligo Election Committee in 1853, and have confirimed my recollection of the facts proved before that committee.
' * The on;ysuppored evidenco on whichthoecommaitteo conld havo come to the resolutions involving you personally in . corrupt act was a letter written by you to Mr. oerdor with reference to an old debt to a Mr. O'Donovan. That letter was on more than one occasion tendered in evidence and on objection rejected, and, as 7ou are aware, it does not appear on the minutes of the evidence.
",As counsel for Mr. Towneley, I can say that tho case, as it affected you and, through you, Mr. Towneley, was conducted to the end on tho assumption that such letter was not in evidence, and that otherwise that part of the casm rmight have been explained by comment or materially altered by counter-proof. I can also state tbat the contents of the letter, as far as they came to my knowledgo, vwithout wishing to impugn the docision of the majority of the commuittee, would not in my judgment, wThen properly oxplained, bear the construction put upon thom.

..*We do not see that wo have anything to explain. That Mr. Stonor lost his appointment on the ground that he had participated in bribery at Sligo w all that we asserted. W. expressed no opinion on his guilt or innocence, and the fact that he was recalled from Australia on the belief tnat he had been found Guilty is notorious.

(FBO2 OUB OWN OORRBBSONDZNT.)
[A portion of the following appeared in our seoon edition of yesterday -]
PARIS, Arnir 5, 6 r.ss. I The diplomatic rupture between Austria and Sardinia is now complete. Ar, Austria will doubtless tbink it beneath her to take the initiative towards a reconciliation, and as Sardinia is certainly not disposed to make advances, if we may judge from the present disposition of that Goversment and the Chambers, matters will probably remain in the same state for some time to come; and when we consider the angry feeling which exists on both sides, which the slightest spark may kindle into a flame, it is within the range of possibility that matters may become worse before they are better. It can hardly be alleged that in this instance Sardinia is in fault. It was clearly her interest-and I believe her statesmen were convinced of the fact -that she should be on good terms with all foreign States, and particularly with her neighbours. Her military ambition was amply Eatisfied by the distinguished part she took in ihe war with Russia, and which has fixed her place in Europe. Content with that, she was anxious that the whole of her energies and resources sbould be applied to carrying out her various projects of internal improvement, and securing an uninterrupted progress in her commerce with the rest of Europe, and particularly with the other Italian States. As it does not appear that her rulers are indifferent to the interests of their country, it is difficult to believe that they wantonly picked a quarrel with a powerful State like Austria. What the real cause of the dissension is Count Buol, perhaps, knows better than any one; but it is pretty certain that 48 hours before the detpatch of the 10th of February the Sardinian Government had no suspicion of what was to happen, and that to all appearances the diplomatic relations between the two countries, if they were not of the most friendly description, were at all events at that moment not of a nature to indicate the near approach of a rupture. Indeed, no one was more surprised than the Sardinian and French Cabinets at the sudden change. No new incident had occurred to justify it. The grievances of M. de Buol, as founded on the attacks of a portion of the Piedmontese press and the general revolutionary character of the Government, are not new. They are not now for the first time set forth; they are precisely the same that have been alleged repeatedly. They might have explained the estrangement of Austria from the day when a free Governmient was established inPiedmont, but they do not suffice as a fresh ground of quarrel. It is not the fault of Piedmont if refugees from the other Italian States, unwilling or unable to endure the despotic system of their own sovereign,na seek a refulge in her territory, and flock to a place where they may live unmolested for their political opinions, the inscitutions of which meet with their sympathy, and which possesses the additional advantage of proximity to the homes from which they are banished. Austria could not expect, and probably did not expect, that the Sardinian Government would disgrace itself by ejecting from its territory men who violated none of its laws, or that it would impose on them a silence to which its own subjects were not compelled. For such conditions it was not worth while to go into exile, and Naples or Rome would have been ill exchanged for Genoa or Turin. But if the Piedmontese territory abound in the elements of revolution which menace the quiet of Austria, the policy of Austria herself is the cause ot it. It is Austrian influence which encourages and supports the Italian Governments in refusing to their people concessions which, whenever they are obtamied, are only ex-torted from their fears; and it is Austria which counsels or compels their suppression the moment the danger has passed away. It is Austria that perpetuates the policy which forces so many to expatriate themselves, and which colects so many dangerous elements in Piedmont; and it is Austria that is realy accountable for the consequences, for the policy which produces them is all her own.
It may be doubted whether Piedmont realy cherishes the dangerous ambition of annexing Lombardy to her posseesions. Her experience of the past, the sacrifices she has already made, and the burden imposed on her by the rashness and credulity of her previous Government, have not been in vain, and, in the present state of Europe, would deter her from renewing the experiment. But that Piedmont views with impatience and indignation the permanent occupation by Austria of neighbouring Italian States is certain, and she would be justified in obtaining, or, if she had the power, compelling, her withdrawal. Piedmont, I believe, has no desire to cross the Ticino, but she can hardly feel tranquil or secure so long -as Austrian troops remain to the south of the Po. All this, however, is of old date, and does not satisfactorily explain the present discontent of Austria. But may not this discontent be traced to mortification at the slight effect produced by the concessions tardily accorded to the Lombards on the occasion of the Emnperor's visit to his Italian provinces? The enthusiasm which we were told was excited by his presence was, it is to be feared, more on the surface than in the hearts of his subjects. It lasted probably as long as the Emperor was on the spot, but its flame was transient. It has not survived his departure, and it may be that the very concessions themselves rather wounded the susceptibilites of the Italian people than satisfied their exigencies. It is doubted whether the project of the Imperial visit was originally meant to be carried out; but it has, at any rate, been followed by disappointment. The struggle between the civil and military elements in the administration of Lombardy has beeii long going on, and the praiseworthy experiment of securing the ascendancy to the former by the visit of the Emperor has failed, and the Italians are in reality no more contented now than they were when under militai-y domination. To win the sympathies and affections of the Italians even the kindness of their foreign rulers does not avail. To insure their obedience they must still be ruled with a rod of iron, for such is the sad condition of Austrian power in Italy. Mortified at her want of success in gaining the attachment of her subjects, who knew too well what value ought to be set on her promises, and in what mianner her concessions are carried out, Austria would persuade the world that it is Piedmont which intercepts the gratitude of her people; and, hating as well as fearing the proximity of liberal institutions, with their accompaniment of prosperity and content, the turns on that Power, and accuses her of undoing what she has done by encouraging revolutionists. The very moderation of Piedmlont adds to her exsperation. Few things would please her more than an overt act of hostility on her part. Piedrmont is well disposed, for many reasons, to keep on the reserve and remain quiet. There are limits, however, to forbearance, and if those limits are passed the consequence would no doubt be prejudicial to Piedmont, but Austria would not pass unscathed from the conflict.
M. de Moltke, the Danish Minister in Paris, had an interview yesterday with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It is dehied in well-informed quarters that the question of the Duchies has been submitted to the exclusive judgment of the Germanic Diet, or that the English and French Governments have as yet returned a definitivo answer to the demand by the King of Denmark of their good offices. These Governments have, however, expressed their friendly feelings towards the King; and it is thought that the question of the Duchies will be taken into consideration as soon as the affairs of Neuchftel and the Danubian Provinces are disposed of.
The Conference on the Neuchatel question will probably meet to-morrow again. Two or three points are said to be in a fair way of arrangement, namely, the amnesties, the participation on the part of the whole Confederation in the expenses of the occupation, and the preservation to the K;ing of prua off the title of Prince of NeuchbteL There wre otY$ rointsa however, on which the parties In. te d 1et411 difer widely.
With regard to the affair of the Bishop of WMoulins, it i3 a d that the Pope has not demanded his reuignation, ashHi Holine8s did in the cue of the Bishops of Lucon and Pamibres, but that he bAs written to the prelate in friendly terms, recommending him to be more indulgent and conciliatory in future. Moreover, in conbequence of the friendly interventlon of the Pope and of some eminent prelates, and notwithstanding the decison of the Vounel of State, a better understanding has been Eetablihh betwreen the Government and II de - DreuxBrez4 Marsihal Pelissier, who it appe is Izi intimate friend of the Bishop, baaassiselted in bringing about a reconciliation. It remains to be aeon whether thiz proceeding will bo Wufflient to
restore tranquillity to the diocess of Moulins or restore confidence in the Bishop.

VIENNA, AXrt'L 3.
The Austrian pre3s has received instructions to abstain from any and all attacks on Sardinia, as the Imperial Government is resolved that it shall be the fault of the Turin Cabinet if the breach between the two countries becomes wider than it now is.
The hostility of this Government towards Russia increases daily; and it is not surprising that such is the case, as every now and then offensive remarks that have been made by the Russian colony at Nice find their way to this city.
The Wiener Zeitung of this morning contains the concession granted by this Government to 23 nobles and gentlemen to construct the following lines of railroad:-A. From Lemberg to Przemysl, where it will join the Northern Railroad. B. From Lemberg to Brody, on the Russian frontier. C. From Lemberg, in a southerly direction, on the right bank of the Dniester, to Czernovitz, and thence to the Moldavian frontier. D. The State pledges itself not to permit any other company to construct a railway on the right bank of the Dniester, from Przemysl to Czernovitz, unless it agree to touch at new points, important in a strategic, political, or commercial point of view. As the particulars connected with the East (allician Railroad were communicated to you some months ago, but little need now be said
on the subject. The capitl of the company is 55,000, OOOfl. Government guarantees 6 per cent. interest, and one-fifth per cent, towards the sinking fund. It is a well known fact that goods, and not passengers, make a railroad pay wel, and it is therefore to be supposed that the Galjician Railroad wil ultimately be as profitable as the Northern Railway. A Belgian company wishes to obtain a concession for a railroad in the Zips, a county in Northern Hungary, but the Emperor a few days since declared his resolve not to sign any new concessions for some time to come. The [concession granted to the founders of the East GaUician Railroad Company is for the term of 90 years.
The Burgomaster of Pesth, who lately made an imprudent speech which gave great offence to the Hungarians, has received leave of abeence for a year. It is now &aid that the Chevalier von Conrad, the official in question, made
defamatory mention of the Hungarian magnates, and not of the Magyars in general, and it is the more probable that such was the case as the matter was very warmly taken up by the leaders of the old Conservative party. The excessive zeal of M. von Conrad has injured the Imperial cause, for some of the great nobles are deeply offended, and vow that they will remain entirely passive while their Majesties are in Hungary. It was the wish of the Austrian Government that the " Banderia"* should be on foot while their Majesties were
in Hungary, but the nobles say that, as aU the
ancient H3ungarian institutions have been abolished, they (the Banderia) have also ceased toexist. The end of the matter will probably be that some slight concessions will be made to the HungPrians, and that they, being in better humour, will raise bands of well-mounted men, which will escort their Majesties from one part of the kingdom to the other The Banderia never rendered military service after the fatal battle of Mohacs in 1526, but still they took the field on certain solemn occasions. Thus they
escorted the crown of St. Stephen whenever it was removed from one place to another, and accom-
panied the Hungarian monarchs in their progresses through the kingdom.
The futiure position of the Jews in Austria is not yet settled, but it is by no means likely that their
disabilities will ever again be as great as they were at the beginning of the year 1848. If the information which has reached me be correct, no special
law or ordinance relative to the Hebrews will be published, as the feelings of the Christians towards them differ greatly in the various Crown lands.
Thus, in Austria Proper, Gallicia, Bohemia, Moravia, Hungary, and in the Austro-Italian provinces, the Jews have been permitted to acquire real property, because the municipal authorities have made noobjectiontotheirdoingso, butno Hebrew has purchased house or land in Styria or in the Tyrol. There is a strongfeeling against the children of Israel in Styria, and any attempt to obtain a footing in the Tyrol would to a certainty fail. According to a
Vienna correspondent of the Augs7surg Gazette, some wealthy Austrian Jews have recently expressed a wish to purchase a part of those domains which a
couple of years since were ceded to the Bank, and if such is the case the Minister of Finance will hardly reject their offer. It is generaly felt here that Baron Hess, the Chief of the General Staff, is under a cloud, but no one is able to give a positive reason for his being so. It is, however, said that His Majesty the Emperor is much displeased that so little has been done towards the fortification of the eastern part of Galicia, and that the two new barracks which have just been constructed here at an enormous expense are likely to prove most insalubrious residences for the troops. The barracks in question greatly attract the attention of travellers, who express their surprise that His Majesty should have permitted his engineers to erect such towers of B abel on such a spot. The two buildings disfigure the city terribly, and, besides, entirely spo il the effect of a handsome new gate opposite the Oustom-house, which is named after the Emperor.
There is seriously a question of throwing down the ramparts, and to form boulevards like those at Paris between the city and the suburbs. The razing of the fortifications of the city would effectually remedy the evil of immoderately high
house-rent, as700 or 800 large houses might be built on the glacis; but the Austrian Government is not fond of whole measures, and you may therefore expect to hear that the inner city is to be enlarged by throwing further out those bastions which are near the Schotten and Kmrnthner gates. At present the rate of morta lity in Vienna is in 19, but the medical worid is of opinion that the Austrian eapital would lose its unenviable reputation for insalubrity if the ramparts were removed and the streets of the city better ventilated.

B3ERLIN, AmRiL 4.
Now that the affair of the Sound Dues has been so satisfactorily settled, the only two staple subjects of interest that remain rife in these parts are the Dano-German conflict and the NeuchQtel question. With respect to the former, I mentioned
in m y last letter that the1- two German Powers
nave by verbal communications to the Danish Ministers accredited to Vienna and Berlin appointed Denmark a limited and fixed term in which to make some satisfactory overtures, at the expiration of which (without satisfaction) they will bring the matter before the German Confederation. It is probable also that they will avail themselves of the interval to make representations to the other Courts of Europe, in reply to those lately put forward by Denmark, in which they wi ll show that in t the remonstrances they have addreswd to Denmark the integrity of that country is not attacked, but
rather that the integrity of the German Federal territory is attempted to be defended, &c. The only thing new in this matter since I last wrote is a motion introduced yesterday into the House of Notables here, to the effect that the House should resolve to call upon His Majesty's Government, in umion with their German lllies, to continue with all energy and emphasis to strive for the realization of the guarantees contained in the German Federal Law of the righta of the country and people of every Federal State with reference to those lands appertaining to the German CofCoderation, but subject to the Crown of
I
I
De-nark, viz., Holstein and Laue..burg. , The promoters of the motion vindicate the propriety of the Houses adopting this resolution,-first, from the exclusively German nature of the matter as issue ; and, secondly, from the circumstance that its predecessor, the late First Chamber,had on a former occasion given the weight of its vote in favour or the rei-statement of the rightful authority (thDuke of Holstein) in those territories, and conse quently it becomes the House on this occasion t) strive for the assurance of the rights of the country itself.
As regards the matter of Neuclhatel, the circumstance of several sittings of the Conference having lately taken place at Paris at short intervals has led some sanguine spirits to expect that the matter will soon be set at rest; the total absence of anything like authentic information on the nature of the Prussian stipulations in a certain sense favours this impression. a have hitherto refrained from giving you any statement of what those stipulations are supposed to be; I venture, however, to mention the following, as being probably very nearly correct:-The King expresmes his willingness in the interest of Europe to cede his sovereignty of NeuchAtel on the following conditions:-L The Kings of Prussia shall retain for ever the title of Prince of Neuchatel and Valangin. 2. Switzerland to bear aU the expenses that have been caused by the events of September last, more particularly by the occupation of Neuch&tel. 3. The Canton of Neuchatel is to share in those expenses only according to the number of its population ; no corporation, no family, and no individual inthe canton is to be specally sassesed to them in addition. 4. N~o :euchatelois shall be brought before any criminal court on account of any participation in the events of last September, or be proceeded against for damages in any civil court. 5. Switzerland to pay the King of Prussia anindemnification of 2,000,000f. The canton of Neuchatel is to contribute to this amount only according to its fair proportion, and no class of the population is to be specially assessed to it. 6. The church property that was confiscated by the State in 1848 is to be restored, and in future the Reformed Church shall have a due share in the administration of this property. 7. The State shall be debarred from in future taking possession of the property of the chadtable institutions, the hospitals, and other benevolent establishments of a like public nature. The bourgeoisie of Neuohdtel shall more particularly retain for ever, according to the will of the testator, the management of the legacy left by the Baron de Pury. 8. A general amnesty shall be issued, in vwhich more particularly those militianmen shall be included, who, by leaving their homes, evaded being coerced into bearing arms against their Prince. This amnesty shall be extended to all political offences and those committed against the Press Laws previous to September 3, 1856. 9. A revision of the Constitution of Neuchatel shall not take place for six or 12 months, and only natives of Feuchatel shall take part in this revision.
This sum of 2,000,000f. demanded of Switzerland is represented on the one hand as the caDitalization at 20 years' purchase of the 100,000f. secured to the Prince by way of civil list, and on the other band as the arrears of the produce of the domains; the object of this latter representation being to show the continuity of the Kinkg of PruAmSiaXs rights from 1848 up to the present time.
Our Government has ratified the treaty for the Redemption of the Sound Dues, and the ratification was exchanged at Copenhagen prior to thelstinst.
This last quarter-day here in Berlin has exhibited a greater number of persons destitute of all further house accommodation than any former quarter-day. With each successive year the state of things in this respect becomes worse. On the one side the proprietors raise their rents every time the yearly contract expires, till house-rent is now from 40 to 80 or 100 per cent. dearer than it was five or six years back; and, on the other side, the unhappy parents of blooming children find themselves everywhere turned out because they " have their quivers full of them." The proprietors of houses are impressed with the unj-iiable belief that the presence of children living in a house tends to diminish the attraction of the dwelling to the other inmates, and thus on every occasion the owners of these live appendages receive notice to quit, so that even where they have the means and the will to pay they fall into the class of the houseless destitute. The workhouses and other refuges generaUy receive a large accession of company at the turn of the quarter, from the mere impossibility of the " outs" converting themselves into " ins" rapidly enough, and this quarter the Government has found itself obliged to put some empty barracks at the service of the lodging-seeking population, and thus afford them shelter, for which, however, they pay dear enough, until they can find house room till next quarter-day. Unfortunately, rent is not the only necessary of life in Berlin that has been enhanced in price of late; all articles of food and consumption are from 15 to 40 per cent. dearer than five years ago, while all articles of wearing-apparel are dearer than in England, without being nearly so good.

A letter from Florence of the 29th of March, informs us that the smal inancial world in Tucany is in motion, in consequence of the principal merchants of Forence and Leghorn having announced their intention to establish a Tuscan bank, having branches in the principal towns, issuing notes, discounting commercial bills, lending money on a deposit of public securities, and opening accounts current. The managers propose to lend 4,000,000livres to theGovernment, who on their part engage to receive thenotes of the bankin allthepublic offices. The shares are to be issued at par-a certain number to be reserved for the founders of the bank. The writer of the letter observes that there are at present in existence two respectable banks-one at Florence, and the other at Leghorn, which discount commercial bills, and the notes of which are not negotiable at par except in the town where they are issued. The charter of these two banks will expire in the year 1858. There are, moreover, banks at Pisa, Sienna, Lucca, and Azegno, but their operations are perfectly local, and their notes are hardly seen outside of the town in which the bank is established. The Government approves the plan of a bank, and is determined to convert it to its own profit by carrying it on with Government officers and selling the shares at a premium. MM. Testini, Attorney-General at the Court of Accounts, and Mantellini, an advocate, are appointed to prepare a plan. The railway from Florence to the Roman frontier, by Arezzo, which was conceded to a French company, is not making much progress. The extension of the rai - way from Sienna to the Roman frontier is carried on with great activity. Robberies are being multiplied in Tuscany withont any interruption from the police, who never arrest any of the malefactors. A robbery committed a short time since at the country house of Count Alexander, at Petrojo, has created a great sensation. Petrojo is situate in a very populous district. A band of 30 robbers, divided into several detachments, attacked the house at 9 in the evening. They found 6,000f. in cash, with whioh they decamped, and illtreated in theirprogress some peasants who attempted to stop them. They were well armed, and appeared to be fully determined to defend themselves.
A letter from Genoa of the 31st ult. announces the arrival of the Prince de Joinville in that city.
A letter from Rome of the 27th March announces that Signor Trasmondi, Governor of the Castle of Paliano, in which seven political prisoners were shot dead when attempting to escape, had been named Chevalier of the Order Piano. Captain Aganesi had been decorated with the order Gregariano, and other officers with that of San Silvestro, the same order which was given to the Roman officers who distinguished themselves at Vicenza in 1848 during the war of independence. The soldiers have received double pav, and the non-commissioned officers are promised rapid promotion. The Jesuits have definitively gained the day over the Brothers of the Christian Doctrine. The college under the direction of the Brothers is to be closed. Such is the order of Cardinal Antonelli Count de Rayneval, the French Ambassador, had interferedin favour of the Brothers, but without succes. General Goyov, the commander of the French troops, was more energetic in his remonstrances, but with as little suocess as the diplomatist. The Jesuits for the moment are all-powerful at Rome. They have completely monopolized the education of the youth in the Ronan States. They are fully aware of the immense power they derive from this xource, and they are determined not to permit any other body to divide It with them. The Government on its side appears to be desirous to demonstrate that all progrs is impoosible in that unfortunate country.

The European arrived on Tuesd.ay, the 10th iast., aud, as she sailed on the 14th of December from Southampton, her passage was 58 days. The Oneida, Simla, and European have all performed wrell, and they have rather diminished the advantages w;hich the Mediterranean ronte has been assumed to have over the Cape route. The next grand experiment we look for is the great Leviathan. There is no doubt that some of our clippers have attained the speed of 18 nautical miles within the hour under favourable circumstances. The Lightning, when new, did so. By uniting superior form with improved means of propulsion I can see no reason why a normal speed of 20 knots should not beattained. Seeing that the tendency of all improvements in the art of shipbuilding within the last 20 or 30 years has been to merease the size of our ships, it seems by no means too sanguine an expectation to look forward to a succession of leviathan packets sailing between Melbourne and a Channel port in 35 days. Electric telegraph wires from the Malay peninsula, by Sumatra, Java, and Torres Straits, to Australia are quite within the bounds of probability; the longest of the cables would not be 200 miles, and the greatest inconvenience would be in securing the wires through a country peopled only by savages. Puck's pledge may yet be redeemed:
" rn put a girdle round about the earth "s In forty minutes."
The official changes which I mentioned in a former letter as likely to take place on the retirement of the Chief Justice have been in part carried into effect. Sir W. A'Beckett has retired; he is to have a pension of l,5001., or half his salary. The Attorney-General, Mr. Stawell, has succeeded him. Mr. Stawell is therefore virtually out of the Ministry, though not yet swrorn in as Chief Justice. Further consequences have vet to develope themselves. The Ministry wrill have great difficulty in filling up the vacant office with any one whom they would be content to take.
There seems to be a building mania among the principal banking corporations of this city. The English and Scottish Chartered Bank set the fashion by erecting a grand building, as remarkable for the chaste style of its external architecture as for its convenience within. Its hail of business-the shop, as the successors of the Lombard goldsmiths call it, is a very beautiful chamber. The Bank of New South Wales follows, and is putting up a palace in Collins-street. It will be a splendid building, though its frontage is rather narrow. The cost of this building will be25,0001. The Bank of Australasla, which has already a fine banking-house, is about to expend 40,0001. in stone and cement. The Union Bank of Australia is also improving its fine building. The flourishing Bank of Victoria, which is at present not well housed, will probably follow the lead. The youngest of our banking institutions, the Colonial Bank of Australia, which is doing remarkably well, is well enough lodged for years to come.
After six weeks of dry weather we have had two storms of heavy rain. One last week was accompanied by one of the sharpest thunderstorms I have ever seen in this country. The lightning shot upwards in vivid columns, and the reports followed immediately upon the flash. It appeared fearfully near the earth, and yet I have not heard of any damage. On Tuesday night it again commenced raining, and continued for about 16 hours. It was a perect deluge. Melbourne is built upon very undulating ground, but the valleys meet about the centre of the town, and Elizabeth-street, running north and south, is the lowest in the city. This street was converted into a rapid stream,which could not be crossed without danger. I never saw evea this street so flooded. The channels or gutters are all open, pitched or paved with stone, the roadway being metalled. Where streets cross each other the channel is continued. In these channels the water was so deep and rapid as to alarm the omnibus horses, and some lost their footing and fell; one was within an ace of drowning. Many of the shops were flooded. Yet rain was much wanted, and this fall will do much good by giving the parched gardens a new lease and filling tho water tanks. All good houses have a tank large enough to supply a family for several weeks. A family of about a dozen will, with a somewhat lavish expenditure of water, consume about 400 gallons per week. These tanks are usually 8ft., 10ft., or 12ft. in diameter, and from loft. to loft. deep. The water is collected from the roof, and is filtered before it is consumed. It is soft aud excellent for all purposes. The tank is generally bricked and cemented within. In some houses there is an elevated iron tank for the purpose of high service, filled by a forcing pump from the underground tanks. The cottage style of house, with only a ground floor, is most favourable to the tank, as it has an extra proportion of surface roof. From a cottage roof of 2,500 square feet nearly 3,000 gaUons may be collected in one night of continuous rain. The plan would be quito practicable in England to secure a good supply of soft rain water for domestic purposes. I may mention here that we are well supplied with A merican ice at 4d. per lb., delivered in all the suburbs around Melbounre.
By the Simla we lose for a time one of the most active, intelligent, and public-spirited of our colonists, Mr. William Westgarth, of the firm of Westparth, Ross, and Co., formerly a member of the LegisYative Council for the city of Melbourne. He is the author of some admirable reports on the trade and resources of the colony, written as Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce. He distinguished himself as an active member of the Anti-Transportation League, and he was the principal mover and supporter of the simple tariff now in force here, which imposes duties on a few articles of large consumption, leaving all others free. He is full of accurate informatiou respecting the condition and resources of the colony.
It seems to me that the present state of the trade of this colony justifies a few words of caution to the shippers of goods to this market. During the latter part of 1855 and early part of 1856 the mark-ets were steadily recovering from 'the previous glut and extreme depression. The speculative consignors almost ceased to export to Melbourne, and the regular importers were left to the operation of their own prudent calculations. The import trade generally became rerunerative. Accumulation made itself manifest in various ways, as shown in my last letter, and especiaUy by an increase of about 25 per cent. in the private deposits of the banks. The large amount of mere money capital seeking investment lowered the rate of interest, or (and this is only another form of the same statement) raised the price of securities. Thus, without any material advance in rents, except for certain classes of houses in certain favourite situations, the price of house property has risen. Government 5 per cent. debentures have also risen to 1011. In short, we have had for some time very great commercial prosperity, and that prosperity continues. But there are certain clear indications that that prosperity is at least threatened, and therefore it is that I use the words of caution and warning. Recent accounts from England show that there is a growing disposition to ship to this market. Imports for some months past have been steadily increasing, and, although the quarterly imports and exports still show a healthy state of trade, the merchants evince a justifiable uneasiness at the increase of the former, and especiaUy at the further increase which their advices lead them to expect.
I extract from Murray's Price Curreo-a useful and carefully conducted publication-tbe foUowing comparative table of the stocks of duty-paying goods for the last three years=
2ONDED GOODS.
185The following tae hows the quantities of eoGds in Ibond at Melbourne in the month of January respectvely in 1855. 1856. and 1857:-.-
" At the beginning of last year ihe stocks in bonrd were UnnalMaly low, and this year it will be seen tlit nearly every article ai gretly over supplied.L
It will be observed that stocks are generally larger thau in January, 1855. Against this we must make due allowance for the inGrea5e of our P -EPulation during the two yeam It is to this alone
we must attribute the fact that what was sufficient to produce a glut in 1855 now only produces a ftationary and slightly stagnant market. Now, this is a state of the market which rashness and iUprudence on the part of the shipper may easily convert into a glut. This is what I am anxious to avert.
As far as I am able to observe, our importing merchants conduct their affaiss with great prudence, circumspection, and skill. The best proof of this is that they have withstood the severe shock of 1854-5 'with very few failures among their body. But their most careful calculations are liable to be defeated by the rashness of consigninghouses at home. I believe it is pretty weU known that when a large m-anufacturing house in Manchester, Leeds, or Birmingham enters into the consigning business to foreign and colonial markets, sooner or later they are brought down. The buyer for the Melbourne market, the partner, perhaps, of the selling house here, adjusts his purchases to the demands of the market, with which he is generaUy well acquainted. He enjoys the advantage of the rnmutest information from his Melbourne partner. In quantity, in quality, in peculiarity of make, in the nature of the package, in the apportionment of quantity by each ship, and a thousand other little circumstances, the mere speculative consignor is no match for him. I say, tberefore,i the regular importer were left to the consequences of his own operations alone the trade would seldom exhibit those ruinous fluctustions which we have witnessed within the last few years.
But the importer can never be certain that he may not suffer by the errors of others. No sooner do the markets show marked evidence of improvement than the consignor, with very imperfect advantage, steps in, and by his imprudent shipments defeats the most prudent calculations of the importer. Last year I mentioned in one of my letters some facts that had come to my knowledge on this point, which I may be pardoned for repeating. It was a common practice with some manufacturing houses when they received an order from a Melbourne house to put up a duplicate, or perhaps a double duplicate, of the order, and ship it on their own account. In some cases their own shipment was despatched first, so as to forestal the order they were about to execute. A great many iron houses and a great quantity of iron for building houses were shipped in this way. The same may be said of boots and shoes, and I have no doubt other articles were treated in the same way. This is how the glut was produced, and this is how a glut may be produced again. In many cases, especially in that of the iron houses and house materials, the goods when they arrived would not pay freight and charges. The shippers, who had themselve3 been guilty of this fraudulent conduct, were the first to complain that they conld not get their remittances, and that they were cheated by the Melbourne houses. No such thing. I affirm that the Melbourne houses are, generally speaking, as remarkable for integrity in their dealings as the merchants in any other part of the world. They were, in fact, the victims. It was broadly asserted that Victoria then (early in 1856) owed the English shippers 5,000,0001. 1 exposed the fallacy of that statement at the time. The colony never did owe so much as 5,000,0001. at any one time. We sent home our gold before we got goods in return, and the 5,000,0001. worth of goods in excess of the demand I venture to bay did not create a debt of half that amount. What the goods sold for was generally remitted. If they sold only for the charges the shipper got nothing. He deserved to get nothing, and if the same dishonest and stupid game of indiscriminate shipping and consigning is played again the same result will necessarily follow. Depend upon it the consignment system is a vicious mode of carrying on trade. It leads to disaster wherever it is practised. It pulls down the consignor, and, what is more to be deplored, it pulls down the regular a-nd prudent importer too, and for no fault of his own.
The quantity of gold shipped to this date is 370,671oz., value 1,482,2841., or about 12,000,0001. a-year.

THE CAPITAL OP CANADA.
TO THE EDITOR OF THEE TIMES.
Sir,-In your able article of SatLrday on the Canadian Seat of Government question, you take a very fair viow of the several cities named, but, if you will allow me, I would offer a few observations.
Toronto, now a fine and very prosperous city of 50,000 inhabitants, was formerly caUed not "New York" but York, "Little York," and sometimes " Muddy Little York ;" and, to -ct rid of those latter obnoxious terms, the Legislature reverted to the Indian name of Toronto.
The Parliament buildings in Montreal, it is true, were burnt, but not, as you say, "at the instigation of members of the Legislature ;" for it was the act of a few rioters in the excitement of a moment, and wholly, it is generaUy bdlieved, unpremeditated. It is also an official fact that the then Governor-General, Lord Elgin, stated his conviction that Sir Alan M'Nab and the other members of the House were not actuated by factious opposition.
This contradiction is due to the distinguished men who conscientiously did their duty to prevent the passage of a ineasure condemned by their constituents and by nearly tho entire British population of Canada.
Montreal is most favourable situated for the seat of Government, so also is Kingston, and, did tho question rest between those two places, it is likely the vote in the Legislature wouldbe nearly equal; but as Quebec, Ottawa, Toronto, and even Hamilton have their advocates the matter is wisely referred to Her Gracious Majesty, and thus a stiious bone of contention is happily disposed of.
Though you give the preference to Montreal, yet your true description of Ottawa (formerly called Bytown)entitles it to favourable consideration, because of its position, geographical aud defensible. It is, as it were, on the boemdaries of the two sections of the province; is, or will be - preached by railways from east and west, and also by the Rideau Canal;whilo a vast unsettledcountry extends around it, which would soon become peopled under the influence of the capital ; and, no doubt, its selection would prove acceptable to the people of Canada.
Again, in view of a union of the whole of the British North American provinces-which will probably take place at no distant day-Quebec would be the most fittin caital with a Prince of the blood as Viceroy; but it is, er, a
premature to agitate so grave a question, though it has already occupied the attention of many, and from timo to time been the subject of discussion both in and out of the Canadi n Provincial Parliament.
I am, Sir, Your obedient servant.

Clergymen On The Hustings.
CLERGYME2 ON _THE HUSTIHOGS
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-OnO of the phases of the present elections is the large number of clergymen who have made their appearance ai" hustns " orators. The evil is a growing one, and you would do the church good service if you would notice it. Recriminations and angry words bandied, and party feeling roused, cause ill wiU towards the individual clergyman who loEes his temper in election strife, and the acts of a few bring discredit on the whole body. I believe the root of the evil has its origin in their habits and tatesj having first been seeolarized by quarter sessions, &o., and the transition from the caUiog of the magistrate to that of eleotionecring spouter is not so dificult.
I will select some specimens from your columns to prove how wide-spread iS the evil:-
Shoreham.-Rev. J. Goring proposed Lord A. Lennox. Lichfield.-Rev. J. B. Floyer propoEed Lord Paget.
Barnstaple.-Rov. H. B. Wrey proposed Mfr. Laurie.
Herefordshire.-MIr. King was seconded by the Rev. L. Hig;ns, Mtr. B . Davies by the Rev. 3. Htopton, Sir EL CotteId by the Rev. A. Olive.
Xorfolk (West).-Ilon.' sd: Rev. E. S. Keppel proposed Mr.B.Gurdon;ev. P. Gicortd4on spoke in support.
Rutand.-Rv.C. iliot aeonddithe Hon. G.
Northumberland.-Reov. E. C. Ogle nominated Mr. Beaumont.
Leicestershire.-Mr. G. Frewen wa seconded by the Rev. J. Babington.
Northamptonshimre.Rv. Mr. Lichfield spoke.
Wiltshire.-Rov. Arthur Fane seconded Lord H. Thynne.
Public opinion has alroady nearly driven from the raeocourse, the hunting-field, and the ballroom ministers of Christs 'dock; *it would be equally efficacious if it could be brought to har to epelfrom the magisterial bench and the noisy hustings thoos who promised at their ordination "they
ould maintin and set forward quietness, peace, and love among nll Christian people."

The Apprehended Murrain.
THE APPREHENDED MUBRAIK.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. -
Sir,-In a letter which appeared in your columna oi the 2d inst. I stated that a febrile disorder, complicated with a purlmonary affection, and which, from the peculiarity of its course and of its outbreaks, seemed to possess the ordinary claracters of an infections epizo5tio, was prevalent Among cattle in this district. I did not thlnk it necessary to state in rnore precise termg than I then used that I considered the disease to differ in some important particulars, if no' essentially, from the epizootic pleuro-pneumonia which ha; prevailed, more or less, in Europe, Great Britain, and Ireland since 1835. Moreover, in my remarks upon the elur. rain 'wrhich it is feared may extend to England from the continent, I was careful to express myself in mch a fashion as would show that my information regarding it was im. perfect
While, therefore, I am indebted to Mr. Gamgee, in his comments upon my letter, published!in 27 Tim2es of yesterday, for the information that the murrain from -which danger is to be apprehended is the contagious typbus now prevailing among the herds in some parts of Earope, I con. ceive that he has entirely overlooked the drift of my observations. I argued that, as in this district a deadly form of disease had dauring the last four or five years shown signs of asuming an epizootic character, by its increased virulenoy, and by the rapid and peculiar manner in 'which it spread through cattlesheds-a manner 'which led to the conclusion that the disease was highly infectious then, and more particularly in the face of a spreading murrain in Europethere was sufficient reason for directing urgent attention to measures of internal hygi6ne, as being at least of equal moment with seaboard quarantine, to which preventive measure alone public attention had at that time been directed.
I am aware that the French Commission pronounced that the contagious typhus of cattle was propagated almost solely by contact, direct or indirect, with animnls affected by the oisease; but I am not aware that that conclusion, although it gives great gravity to the question of quarantine, sets aside or diminishes in any degree the importance of the internal measures of hygiene to which I wish to direct particular Attention, or in any way detracts from the opinion generaUy received respecting both epidemics and epizootics, of whatever character they may be, that among the most important, and even almost essential, elements in fostering their development are overcrowding, imperfect ventila.. tion, and pollution of the atmosphere from any and every source.
Since 1837 epizootic diseases have prevailed to A most formidable extent in almost every part of Great Britain and Ireland, and they have affected, more or less, almn-t all classes of animals. The following grave facts, taken from the analysis of epizobtics contained in the Ccns2s of Ireland for 1851 (vol. v, paces 358-9)-although the analysis does not extend beyond 181-will show more clearly than any general statement that an "epizostic constitution" has hung over Great Britain and Ireland for a protracted periodi favouring, if not determining, the development of several deadly epizo6tics-
"(A.D. 1837. Diseaso prevailed among cattle and sheep in England. P. 218.) 1838. The epidemic among pigs continues both here and in England. 1831.f. The epizootio of pleuro-pneumonia, which had spread over England and Vurope, now raged in Ireland; an epizooitic among poultry in Drogheda; a very prevalent and most fatal disease among pigs in the north of Ireland; an epidemic among cattle and pigs in England. 184L An epidemic among cattle, charactenzed by stiffness of the legs and blistersupon the tongee; it spread among sheep in the county of Clare, and it prevailed among horned cattle, pigs, goats, and sheep everywhere in Ireland ; it also extended in many parts of Eturopean epizootic among horses, styled the 'distemper,' also prevaled in lreland. (A highly contagious epidemic among swine, cattle, horses, and sheep prevailed throughout the greater part of England. P. 227.) 1842 The distemper in cattle again set in; pigs also were affected by a disease called cholera; an epizo6tic in Wales and Liverpool, (Prevalent in October. P. 229.) 1843. The disease spread among cattle and pigs throughout Ireland; malignanu influenza among cattle in England. 1844. The epidemic among horned cattle, horses, and swine continued, and was characterized by abscess of the throat and inflammation of the lungs; an epirebtic of pleuro-pneumonia continued to prevail extensively. 1845. The cattle distemper in the north of Ireland; these complaints were general,-viz., of the lungs, of the hoofs, and the Ityphoid epidemic' then raging extensively on the continent; disease was also very fatal among pigs and sheep; horses and cattle were affected in England and in several partsuf Enrope, plcurK.pneumonia among cattle in Scotland, and murrain among sheep (A fatal epizootic, producing gangrene of the lungs, prevailed extensively among cattle in England; epiz(,utics also among horses and pigeons. P. 203.) 1846, Various epizoitic affections prevailed among cattle, chiefly pleuro-pneumonia. In the neighbourhood of Bantry cowpock extensively attaoked black cattle. A fatal epizoiltic among pigs in some parts; domestic fowl were also affected. Pleuro-pneumonia prevailed in England and Sootland; (also a fatal disease among horses in England. P. 275.) 1847. (reat numbers of dogs went mad this aeason. l'leuro-pneumonin still prevailed among cattle. An epizootic among pigs in Queen's County A great mortality of turkeys from epidemic disease. Great mortality among cattle (and sheep) in England. An epizootic destroyed much cattle in Europe. 1848. The disease among cattle continues in Westmeath and Cork, and prevails extensively among pigs in Limerick. A disease resembling smaUpox appeared amaong sheep in England. (Plenro-pneumonia prevailed to an alarming extent in England. X. 311.) 149. The disease among pigs was very fatal in somo parts of the west. Twenty per cent. of horned cattle were lost in some districts from pleuro-pneumonia this year. (In England influenza prevailed extensively among horses, plenro-pneumonia among cattle, and smallpox among pigs 1n some districts. P. 320.) 1850 The epizobtic of pleuropneumonia was very rife in Dublin and its vicinity. It also commenced in the north of KIerry. Strangles prevailed to a great extent ameng horses, and a disease among pigs also spread generally. (in England influenza raged fearfully among animals in July, and an epizootic prevailed in Yorkshire. P. 328.) 185L Horses, sheep, igs, and poultry were all affected by an epidemic this year."
That the epizobtic constitution, that wide-spread predisposition to outbreaks of epizobtic diseases, indicated by the aboTo array of facts, has not ceased in England at the present time, whatever luUs may have taken place, I believe will be generally admitted by those cognizant of diseases among cattle; and upon this ground alone I think that there would be a sufficient war-ant for directing increased and urgent attention to measures of internal hygi6ne. But vwhen, in addition, there is evidence of increased virulency of a certain febrile disorder among the cattle of this district, and of this disorder seizing upon and devastating croNvded cattle-sheds, I think that I amu fully Justified in the opinion which I cxpressed. that (as was the tendency of the conversation in the llouse of Comnions), the direction of the publie to an undue faith in measures of sea-board quarantine, to the neglect of measuresof intermal hygicne, is a serious error.

Sir,-As whatever relates to this dreadful discase is of the utmost Importance to the coniinunity under the prospect of its extension to this country, I have taken the liberty of enclosing for your use an autograph of Arthur Young on the subject, referring to certain authorities for its treat. ment. In the body of his great unpublished work, entitled the Elemcnts and Practice of Agric.Uure, now In the library of his late seat, Bradfield-hall, Suffolk, he does not appear under the head of " Live Stock" further to have noticed it, possibly from his not wishing to hazard an opinion in a matter he might not have been a master of.

Report From The Select Committee On Pub-
REPORT FROM THE SELECT CO-MUTTEE ON PUBLIC PRL'TLNG. -The report of the Select Committee of the tlate) House of Commons on Printing has been publshed, and is worthy of attention, as containing several important and valuable suggestions. The committee quote largely from the report of the Printing Committee of 1841, and r-commend the attention of the Hlouse to their resolutions, which have been carried out from that period with partial success. This committee (of 1841) thought that further means ought to be taken to improve the forms of motion for returns, and to insure compliance with the orders mado thereon. The committee therefore suggested :-1. That every member be recommended before giving notice of motion for a return to consult Mr. Vardon, the excellent librarian of the House of Commons. 2. That, after the House has made an order for a return, the librarian do prepare a form to be submitted to Mr. Speaker for his approval; such forns to be forwarded wvith the order, in the usual way. 3. That, before any return presented to the Rouse shall be ordered to be printed, it shall be inspected by Mr. Vardon and approved by the Speaker; and, 4. T'hat the Speaker do make such arrangements as may be necessary for giving effect to these resolutions. The committee proceed to report that since the control of the S eaker has been exercised, and the valuable assistance of Jr. Vardon afforded as superintendent of the printing, a gradual diminution in the expense of Printing
taken place equivalent to a reduction frnm 30,8441. (iu 1840) to 2u,446l. (in 1856). Another valuable suggestion was the abstracting of bulky papers, so as to give the results to the House; aud 57,3841. has been saved by so doing since the sescion of 1845. It might further be suggested that, in returns containing a mass of figures, the compilers should be ordered to cast up the grand totals in every case. In some returns, moreover (such as the blue-book on church-rates), no genreral result is attainable for want of a synoptical review. The committee next advert to the "reports of commis. 8ious" and papes presented " by command,"-a large b.anch of Parliamentary printing, but which is, notwiths anding, beyond the control of either House. The expense o priting these papers in 1853 and 1854 was 22,9561. for printing, and 10,5881. for the paper. The committee of 1841 recommended that the departments of State to which the various public printers are responsible should control the unlimited power of printing which at present prevails, and that direction should be given to print, where practicable, the
' reports" only of commissioners, leaving it to the discretton of each House to require either a manusript copy of the evidence and documents or the supplementary papers ; and that the papers should be deposited in some ublic oflice for general reference when required. The details of the expensive and bulky books containing the reports and evidence of conmmissioners are often very uninteresting, and are probably unread by all but a few indefatigable Parliamentary b3okwornsn. A table of 234 peges appears in the appendix «of vol. ii. to the Report on Wine Duties, " on the vattings i-'of wine in the docks ;" vet of this Mr. M'Culloch
believed that no sane peson had ever read a line, or ever would;. -and yet 1,750 copies of this rubbish were printed and circulated at the expense of the public. The mode of obviating this abuse was pointed out by the committee of 1841-viz., by conferring extended and discretionary powers on the Printing Committee, especially as regards the publicationi of "evidence" and "appendicese" to reports. The sale of Parliamentary papers has, it appears, averaged an annual net Lamount of 4,0001. by sale and waste. The committee, in conclusion, sauggest, as before, that every member be recommnended, before moving for a return, to consult Ar. Vardon, the libbrarian ; that, after the order for a return has been made, the libraria do prepare a form to be forwarded withb the order- that no return be printed without the inspection of 31r. fardon and the approval of the Speaker; that no papers moved for by address, or by order of the House, ought to be printed except by its own authority; and that oxtended powers be given to the cornmittee to control more effeetively the matter printed in appendices to reports. It is also recommended that the Treasury do lay on the table, with the estimates, a distinct account of the amount of printing expenses executed under the authority of each Secretary of State or public depart
nieit, and by either House of Parliament. The late cor. mittee consisted of Mr. G. A. Hamilton, Mr. Greene, Mr. Beekett Mr. Wilson, Mr. Dlvett, Mr. Gaskell, Mr. V. Smith, Mr. Estcourt, and Mr. Bonham-Carter.
SUSPECTED PoIsoNiq as.-On the afternoon of Sunday, the 22d ul', Mr. Joseph Hodson, farmer, of Collnbaram, near Newark, North Xottinghamshire, was found sitting upright in a obair in bis house, quite dead, by some neikhbours who were alarmed at his not having made his app'earance as usmaL An inquest was held on the following day, and by adjournment on the 30th ult., when it was ascertained that a pareel containing a mince pie had been taken by a boy to the Queen's Head Inn, Newark, to bo conveyed to Mr. Hodson by the Colingham carrier ; but, the latter having left before the arrival of the pareeL it '-as detained by the landlady until the folowing Saturday. and then given to the deceased. A portion of this pie was found on the table of the deceased. Some of it was afterwarids given to a cat, which died in a few hours. The contents of the stomach of the deceased were analy7ed bv Dr. Ransoms of Nottingham, and fonnd to concain arsenic. A

Central Criminal Court, April 6.
CEN RAL CRIMINAL COUBT, jpril 6.
The April seesion of the Central Criminal Court was opened this morning. The coommissioners present at the commencement of the proceedings were the Right Ron. T. Q. Pinnl Lord Mayor of the city of London,; Mr. Rus. sell Gurney, Q.C., Recorder; Aldermen Sir C. M,arshal], SirJ. Duke, and Sir R. W. Carden; Messrs J. T. Mechi and f. Keats, Sheriffs of London and Middlesex-; Messrs. A. Crosley and J. Anderton, Under-Sheriffs; and the usual officers of the corporation.
It appears by the first edition of the calendar that there vre 131 prisoners for trial at the present session. This is very much above the ordinary average, but it is accounted for to a considerable extent by a longer period than usual having elapsed since the last sssion, owing to the occurrence of the spring circuits.
The Rxcostnxc, in his charge to the grand jury, said he regretted to have to infor mn them that -here were a considerable number of prisoners whose cases wvould have to be brought under their consideration-indeed, the number Was much larger than he remembered at any session for a considerable time past. The great majority of the cases, however, were of the ordinary description, and would not require any observations from him respecting them; and it appeared that- n) less than one-fourth of the whole number of prisoners whose names ap red on the calendar were charged with uttering counterfeit coin. He observed by the depositions that il a great number of these cases the coin was not examined and discovered to be counterfeit until after change had been given and the parties had left the shop, and it appeared to him that it tradesmen were in the first instance to examine more carefully the coins that were offered to them, and not to give the change without they were satisfied that they were genuine, it would tend very much to check this description of offence. There were several serious charges, and one of them prewented some circumstances of difficulty, and would require their most careful consideration. The case to which he referred was a charge against a persoa named Thomas Fuller Bacon and his wife, and they wvere jointly accused of the murder of their two children. The evidence in support of this charge was of a peculiar description. It appeared that the last time the two children were seen alive was on Sunday, the 28th of December, and on the following Tuesday morning both the children were discovered dead, and there appeared to be no doubt that they had been murdered by some person or other. The prsoners, it appeared, were seen together on the Sunday while the children were alive, aud at that time the man aanounced his intention to go into the country to look for work on the following morning, and it ppeared that he did leave London on honday morning. 'Tehouse of the prisoners appeared to be shut up from this time until thle murders were discovered, and when the discovery took place the female prisoner made a statement to the effect that some mani had got into the house by the window, and that be had murdered the children by cutting their throats. She afterwards made another statement that it vas her husband who had committed the aot, and thege contradictory statements are the principal evidence against her. Of course, anything said by one prisoner against another was no evidence against that other, but it was evidence against the party nisking it. The evidence by which the charge was sought to be established against the male prisoner was of another description. It appeared from the examination of the bodies of the deceased children that they must have been dead for a considerable time-at all events 30 hours-before they were discovered on tae Tuesday morning, and that the male prisoner had left London on the Monday morning, which was about that period before their discovery. It appeared that during the examination of the female prisoner some surprise was expremsed that no robbery had been committed, and upon the next examination the husband represented that some money and articles of wearing apparel had been stolen, evidently with the intention to confirm his wife's statement that the murder had been comnimitted by a straniger. It turned out, however, that this statement was entirely false, and it was subsequently discovered that there were marks of blood upon his clothes; and these were the principal facts that would be proved against the male prisoner. With regard to the woman, It would appear that at a former period she had been insane and was confined in St. Luke's Asylum, and it was the opinion of the surgeon who .aw the prisoner at the time of the discovery of the murders that she was not then in a sound state of mind; in fact, that she was insane. The grand jury, however, would not take that fact iato their consideration. The only question for them to consider was, whether she was a party to the act that had been committed, and if that was made out to their satisfaction it would be their duty to put heron her trial, and then, if it should be made to appear that she was not in a sound state of mind at the time of the commission of the offenoe, she would, of course, be acutted on that ground. As to the male prisoner, they wou d look carefully at aU the facts, and, if they considered they were sufficient to justify them in putting hin upon his trial, they would, of course, return a true bilL 'Mere was another charge of murder against a woman named Pearce, who was accused of destroying her child, and it appeared that the child was found in the water with a portion of a shawl that was proved to be the property of the prisouer tied tightly round its neck. The prisoner, when she was questioned, admitted that she had tied the piece of shawl round the child's neck and thrown it into the water, and she at the same time said that she had done so because the child was suffering, and that she herself was also suffering, and she intended to have de. stroyed herself if a policeman had not come up and prevented her. Under these circumstances he thought the grand jury would not feel any difficulty in this case insendingthe matter to be inquired into by another jury. There were two cases of manslaughter, but the circumstances were such as not to require any observations from him respecting them. There was another rather peculiar case, in which a man named Willam Webb was charged with maliciously stabbing with intent to murder. It appeared in this case that the prisoner and the prosecutor were alone in a railway carriage, and that the prisoner made a most desperate attack upon the prosecutor with a knife, and there was a long struggle between them, which continued until the train stopped, and the prosecutor was rescued by the guard. The charge, of course, mainly rested upon the evidence of the prosecutor; bue his statement was confirmed by the fact that there was a struggle evidently going on when the train stopped, and that the prosecutor had received some very severe injuries upon the throat; and, under all the circumstances, the grand jury would, no doubt, think it was a proper case for further inquiry. There were two cases in W ich the prisoners were charged with exposing their children on a public highway, and thoreby endangering the lives of those children, and he was somewhat surprised that these prisoners should have been committed upon such a charge. By a recent decision of the judges it had been laid dowu that this offence consisted in exposing the children in such a manner that in the ordinary course of things, their lives would have been endangered, and the grand jury, therefore, wouldnot be justified In findingsa true bill unlessi a md u tha the prisoners really had such intent It appeared by the depositions that the object of the prisoner in one of the cases was that the child ahould be found by the father, and that she should thus be relieved from the burden of maintainmg it; and in the other it appeared that the object of the prisoner was merely to be rid of the child
and the desertion of the children in neither case was
likely to have been attended with any risk to their health or lives, and it was his duty to tell them that it was necessary to make out this fact in order to support a charge of such a description.
The grand jury then retired, and the Court proceeded to dispose of the business of the session.
MIr. METCALFE applied to post one the trial of Thomas Bacon for the murder of his children at Lambeth to the next session. The ground assigned for the application was that the prisoner would not be prepared to take his trial at the present sittings of the Court.
An Attorney, who was instructed to defend Mrs. Bacon, said he had no objection to offer on her part to the postponement of the trial.
hMr. BODKIN, wvho is instructed by the Treasury to conduct the prosecution, said he did not think that the postponement of the trial weuldcin anyUway affect the interests of justice, and therefore, if the Court thought the application ought to be acceded to, he should offer no opposition to it on the part of the prosecution.

Mr. Bodkin and Mr. Payno conducted the prosecution; 3r. Campbell Sleigh appeared for the defendant.
This was a prosecution instituted by the Corporation of the city of London under the following circumstances:At the January sessions the defendant made a charge of a disgusting character against anotherlad named HIolding, and upon his swearing positively to the commission of the offence, the jury returmed a verdict of " Guilty," and sentence of death was recorded against the prisoner. Mr. Baron Bramwell, who tried the case, did not appear to be satisfied with the verdict, and directed the officers engaged in the matter to go with the defendant in a cab and make some inquiries, with a view to ascertain whether
e was speaking the truth in certain statements he had made. Tey had only gone a short distance when the defendant said it was no use proceeding any further, as ho had been telling a parcel of lies, and ho might as well admit it.

The whole of the above fact- were now proved in evi. dleuce, and the lad Holding swore that there was no foundation for the charge that was made against him, and other witnesses were examined who distinctly negatived several of the Bstaemente made by the defendant on the former occasion.

He caUed a number of witnesses, who gave the prisoner an excellent character.
The RBECORDE, in summing up, told the jury that any person who might find a 51.-note or any other article of value was hound to use proper means to endeavour to discover the owner, and had no rieht whatover to appropriate it to his own use- and if he did so, without makring such inquiry, the law held it to be felony.

When the defalcations were found out and an inquiry made, the prisoner confessed to Mr. Morris, one of the firm, that he had embezzled about 3001., but it had been found to exceed that anin.

Middlesex Sessions, Monday, April 6.
MIDDLESEX SESSIONS, Monday, AprU 6.
The sittings of the Court for the April Quarter Sessions were resumed this morning at the Guildhall, Westminster, by adjournment from Clerkenv;ell, before the ASSISTANTJuDrn , Mr. BURSLEJ , Mr. WAP-sN, and Mr. GoiLD. There -were 36 prisoners for trial.
The ASSISTANT-JUDOx briefly charged the grand jury.
John Brown, a Guardsman, was indicted for stealing a watch and chain, the property of Thomas Walker Jubb, in his dwelinghouse.
It appeared that on the evening of the 9th of March the prisonerwas with some comrades at theNTewStarandCrown pablichouse, kept by the prosecutor, in the Broadway, westminster, and theywere playing at bagateUeina rooms on the first floor. At about half-past 8 o'clock Mrs. Jubb took a child upstairs to a bedroom on the second floor, and at that time she saw her husband's watch and chain safe on a table In that room. The prisoner was seen on the staircase near the second floor landing, and directly afterwards he walked out of the house. In consequence of a communication made to the landlord he went up to his bedroom and missed his watch and chain, and information was given to the police with the view of the prisoner being applrehended, as he not only was seen near the room, but hailed a cab directly he got out of the house, and told the driver to go as fast as he could. There was a lapse of about a quarter of an hour between the time the watch was seen safe and the prisoner's leaving the house.
The prisoner said, he had been out all tkat day with some comrades who had been discharged. He himself vas about to be also discharged; and they got to this house, where, having drunk too much beer, it got into his head, and, fear. ing he should be too far gone when he got to barracks, he suddenly left the house. He had drunk so much that he recollected nothing afterhe gotintothe street,until hefound hiimself at the stationhouse next morning, when he was told he was locked up for breaking a glass in a tobacco shop and refusing to pay for it. That was so. and then the polie came and charged him with this offence, but heknew nothing whatever about it, he could solemnly declar
The A.SSISTANT-JUDGE sum-med up.
The jury found the prisoner Not Guilty.
The AssIsTixT-JuDGE told him he would be exceedingly fortunate if he escaped on any future occasion, if charged with stealing anything from a second-floor room, near the door of which he was seen within a few minutes of it beic
seen safe, and then driving offin a cab. The prisoner mut be detained until the discharge of the grand jury.
Joseph Petit, 37, an intelligent-looking Frenchman, de. scribed as a "1 negotiator," was indicted for stealing 351. in banknotes, belonging to Henry Woodhouse, in the dwellinghouse of Ann Werner. He was further charged with stealing three ings, a bracelet, &., value 151., the propt of Edward Nelson Haxell, in his dwellinghouse; aud a pair of boots, the property of William Frederick Collard. He pleaded " Guilty."1
Onthe5thofMarchthe prisonerwentto theBedfordHotel, Covent-garden, and, having asked for a bed, he was shown to room No. 19. A gentleman named Woodhouse occupied No. 20, and on the following morning he missed a dressingcase. The prisoner was gone, and the bed he had engaged had not been slept in. On the room being examined the dressing-case was found broken open and lying under the bed, the contents Tgone, and among them some banknotes, which Mr. Woodhouse had received for a draught from the Permanent Way Company, Great George-street, to which he was engner. Acting upon information he had received,
Vincent Gunner, police-sergeant C 21, proceeded to Tho. mas's Hotel, Clifford-street, where the prisoner had a bedroom, and during his absence, but in the presence of the proprietor of the hotel, he examined a bag which was there
elongigto the prisoner, and in it he found two "jiemmies" and a dagger. The articles were replaced in the bag, and when the prisoner returned he took him into custody. In his pocket the offlcer found four of Mr. Woodhouse's notes. The other two cases were precisely similar, The
rosecetor in one was the proprietor of the Exeter-hall hotel, and ithc othera gentlemanwho wasstaying athMarshall Thompson's Hotel, Cavendish-square. The prisoner disElayed a good deal of cunning in his mode of proceeding. W en he went to ask for a bed his face was covered with beard,ud moustaches, which removed when It was neces. sary that he should not be recognized, and be carried a small leathern bag, After staying a short time he would go away, apparently without the bag; but he had an ingenious method of concealing it under his overcoat, so that he could carry it off unnoticed, leaving the impression that he had deposited it in the room he had engaged.
Mr. F. H LEwss said, he was instructed to say a few words on behablf of the prisoner, who had furnished him with a statement, which, however, he was in no way prepared to put in proof. The prisoner stated that he was the son of a euperior officer oi cavalry, who served under the First Empire, and was left at an early age to shift for himself. He entered the French navy, and served in the Levant under Prince de Joinvlle; but bein attacked by jaundice, he was compelled to quit, and he then entered into com. isercial pursuits at Smyrna, and was successful. He had some transactions with a person who decamped, leaving him a loser of 27,000f., by which he was entirely ruined. This had such an effect upon his mind, which had been severely affeeted by the malady contracted at Smyrna, that it brought on a hind of mania for thieving-kleptomania, under the infuence of which he committed the offences for which he was indicted. There was no proof of this, or of course he (Mr. Lewis) should have gone to the jury, but the statement must go for what it was worth.
The.AssisTAN-s.JusDGE said, if the pri.-oner was mad, it was a species of insanity about which there was a good deal of method at any rate. He would consider what sentence to pass.
John Borman, 25. was indicted for stealing 3s. 6d., the money of Hemny W. A. Meech, from his person, at an elec. tion meeting, held at Freemasons-bali. He was found Guilty, and a fonrer conviction being proved against him the Court sentenced him to four years' penal servitude.
Daniel Jacobs§ 19, Henry Parkhurst, 18, and William Smith, 17, were mdicted for stealing a quantity of tools, the property of Abel Penfold and William Arnold.
Mr. Hiawthorne prosecuted; Mr. Poland defendedaJacobs, and Mr. Digby appeared for Parkhurst ; Smith was not defended.
The jury found Jacobs and Parkhurst Guilty, and they 'were sentenced to 12 mouthe' hard labour. Smith waLs Acquitted.
George Corbishley, 40, a respectable-looking man, of superior education, was indicted for feloniously embesslng the several sums ofi8. lfsa., St. ifs., 121. los., and Si. lfs., the moneys of Reuben Conetwell Greatorex, to whom he
The prisoner pleaded " Guilty" to all these charges, and aJEo to having been previously convicted.
The prosecutor is as architect and builder, residing in Westbourue-street Paddington and the prisoner was in his engloyment as clerk and col2ector. It was his duty to co ect moneys for his master, and it was ascertained that op the 27th of September, the 3d and 10th of November, and the 16th of February, the prisonerh bad reeived the sums in question on behalf of his maaster, hut had not ac-
cuted for thiem. When the prisoner was taken into cus-. ody on this charge he said that he was a ruined man for ever.
It transpired that the prisoner was tried at the Central Criminal Court in January, 1852, for forging a bill of exchange, and sentenced to transportation for seven yeasv, but in 1555 he was liberated with a ticket of leave.
Mr. Greatorex, the prosecutor, was called, and in answer to questions from the ASSISTAhT-JUDOE said, he was induced to take the prisoner into his employment in consequence of the strong recommendations to do so which he received from the chaplain of Dartmoor Prison, where he had been confined, and which induced him (prosecutor) to believo that he bad become reformed; but he had been greatly deceived. He had also a good character of him from MIessrs. Grissell, with whom he had lived previous to his conviction.
The AS SITANT-JuDOE, having strongly animadverted upon the prisoner's ingratitude, sentenced him to be kept in penal servitude for the tenrm of aix yea^rs.

Mr. Commissioner MURPHY considered the case one which must be marked by some punishment. A public officer executing a writ in the discharge of his duty ought not to be exposed to such an action as that the insolvent had brought against Mr. Slowmnan.

MANKOROUMs.-John. Berry a warehouseman in the ervice of Messrs. Morland and Wbitcomb, of Star-court, Bread-street, was brought before Sir R. W. CARD,Z, charged with having robbed his employers of a piece of silesia, measurin 60 ards.
Mr. Matthew Headley, the agent and representative of the prosecutors, said, the prisoner was in the em,uloyment of the firm, as warehouseman under me. In onsocueno of information that reached me I watched him on Friday last, and saw him leave the premises during dinner hour, with a piece of silesia, containing 60 yards. I followed him, and saw him take it into the shop of Jacob Hyams, in Middlesex-street, Whitechapel I waited a short time, and saw him come out of the shop and he then had not the pieco with him. I susdequently communicated with the prosecutors, who caused him to be taken into custody. I was present when the constable Packman spoke to him. Packmian charged him with having taken a piece of silesia from our warehouse to Jacob Hyams's. The prisoner said he had taken it and sold it to Hyams, who had given him 3id. per yard for it. Upon takiDng stock a few days ago we missed six pieces of cotton goods. The prisoner has been in the employmert of tho firm about three years at a salary of 24s. per week.
Mr. Jacob Hyams.-I am a trimming seler, and reside at 130, Middlesex-street. I have been in the habit of dealing with the prosecutors, and I know the prisoner. On Friday last he brought me a piece of silesia and asked me to purchase it, but I told himn it did not suit me, and he toorkit away with him. I told him it was of no use to me.
Sir . W. CARDEz.-Was that the whole of the conversation that passed between you ?
Witness.-That is all, and off he went.
Mr. Headley was recalled, and, in answer to Sir R. W. CARDEn, said,-The psisoner left the warehouse with the piece of silesia under his arm. Ho took it into the shop of Mr. Hyams, and when he came out he had not got it. If he had I must have seen it.
Mr. Hyams-lIe had it under his coat when he left my
ahIr. Headley.-The p iece was of such a size that I must have seen it if he had it under his coat.
The prisoner was remanded, for the purpose of enabling the officer who had charge of the case to make further inquiries.

The worthy MAGISTRATE in vain endeavoured to extract from her a plain statement of the circumstances, and at last she burst into tears, repeating, "I can't say it; I reaUy can't, Sir."
Mr. Metcalfe, the defendant's counsel, suggested that the case should be adjourned to a fature day, to give thep rosecutrix an opportunity of composing her mind, and the defendant of communicating with his friends.
Mr. HALL thought this was the only course that could be taken. Meanwhile he would admit the defendant to baiL
Two sureties in 2501. each wver at once provided.
MARLBOROUGH-STRE.-Lieutenant Ernest Augustus Lloyd, of the Royal Artillery, was brought before Mr. BsIGHAxs for further examination, charged with obtaining goods from numerous tradesmen by fraudulent pretences.
Mr. CampbeU Sleigh, who appeared for the accused, said he did not mntend to offer any justification for the indiscreet conduct of his client in giving checks to tradesmen from whom he had made purchases on his agents, Messrs. Cox and Co., when there were no funds to meet those checks ; but he was in a condition to show that his client was a gentleman highly connected, holding a commission in Her Majesty's service, and that when he gave the checks he was under the impression that he should be in funds, from the sale of some reversionary property, in time sufficient to enable his agents to honour the checks. There was a gentleman from Messrs. Cox and Co. in court who would prove thatIaeutenant Lloyd had an account stlU open with the firm. He trusted, therefore, that the magistmto would accede to his application for a remand of a week.
Mr. Bl2-GFm said he had no objection to accede to this moderate request, as he believed it was Mr. Beadon's intention, who heard the case in the first instance, to remand it.
Mr. Sleigh hoped moderate bail would be accepted. Mr. Brsumn would not refuse good bail.
A tradesman who had been victimized hoped 'that heavy bail would be required, as the amount obtained from tradesmen did not fall far short of 2,0001.
The prisoner was then remanded for a week.
Thomas Baker was charged with obtaining goods by false pretences.
The prisoner, it appeared, had been in the service of Colonel Daniell, 54, Grosvenor-street, and he had made use of his former mastees name to defraud tradesmen.
The prisoner did not deny his guilt, and was fully committed for trial.
WORSUIP-STm r.-Wfliam Buttery, a tbick-set, powerfulfellow, described as a gunsmith, was charged with a orutal asault on his wife.
The wife, a decent-looking woman, whose face was bound up with a cloth, and who was in such ony she could scarcely stand, deposed to being insulted and beaten by the prisoner in a very cruel manner, he knocking her down five or six times with his fist, till, as the woman said in court,
she was suffering the greatestpsin in her head and arms; her limbs were bruised all over, her jaws so imjured that she could not eat, her teeth were all loose, and her head covered with lumps," and he finally dealt such a terrible blow at her with the fire-tongs that it split clear into halves a table upon which it descended, and beneath which she had crawled to avoid him.
Prsoner.-I had been out drinking, and that was the cause of it.
MIr. ]YErNcoURv.-This is a verv bd case. You must go for six months' hard labour to the House of Correction.
Prisoner.-I shall not come out alive, I think.
Mfr. YFEYcoURT (to the wife).-If the parish will do something for yoaLI may perhaps be able to assist you, or I am afraid you will starve, as you can manifestly earn but little in such a state.
The poor woman expressed herself very gratefuUy.
CL=x=wzLL-Willia Bussell, aged 21, a barman employed at the Sun publichouse, at the corner of Ormondstreet, LAmb's Conduit-stret, St. Androw's, Holborn, ws brought up in the custody of Mr. InspectorCheckley, R divison, and placed at the bar before Mr. Connnr, charged with causing the death of Joseph Lockwood, aged 40, under the following circumstances:
Henry Small, of I.ainb's-yard, Lamb's Conduit-street, haDg been sworn, saidthat on Saturday morning last, at about a quarter past 6 o'clock, he was at the Sun publicbouse, wheu he saw the prisoner seize the deceased and throw him with great violence into the street. He fel on
the pavement and injured his head, from which he bled very much, and he was taken to the hospitaL
Mr. C. HaLford, of Caledonian-road, sworn, said at a quar. ter-past 6 o'clock on Saturday morning he was in Lamb's Conduit-street, near the Sun, when he heard something fall very heavily on the ground, and on looking round he saw a man lying on the road insensible and bleeding from his head. Witness rendered him assistance and had bim conveyed to the hospital, where he died yesterday (3ouday)
mhr. Inspector Richard Checkley, B, said that he received information with reference to the case and the death of the man in the hospitsl, when he felt it to be his diity to take the prisoner into custody and bring him to this court.
Mr. CosRE asked the prisoner if he wished to give any erojanation as to the affair.
l'he prisoner said that on Saturday morning, at about the hour mentioned by the witnesses, the man (deceased) came into the Sun and was served with tbreehalfpenny worth of rum, when he became insulting, used bad languase, and threatened him; and after cautioning him he seized him by his arms and pushed him into the street while another person opened the folding-doors.
Ir. COltRstE inquired who and what the, deceased was.
Answer.-He wias in the habitv of drawving pictures with coloured chalk uspon the pavements for a living.
Mr. Cosestrst.-I shall remand the prisoner to this day week, but will accept hail.
TuA=s.-Mr. SEix has received a donation of 51. from A. S." for the unfortunate man Francis Baker and his famiy.
SOVUIWAIK.-3Sr. William Gibson surrendered to his own recognizances charged with stealing four half-crowns and a sixpence from Angelina Leman, a fashionably-dressed young German, residing at 76, Upper Stamford-street, under
very singular circumstances.
Mr. BUlRCLUe asked the prosecutrix what better accoumt she could give of herself.
She said she came from Germany to learn English in 1851, the time of the Exhibition. She remained three weebs and went to Berlin. Last year she was nine months in l6ing.
Mr. BuRCEaS.-What property have you to subsist on ?
Iditness.-I have some cottages left me in Germany, and I soldl thein for 1,700 thalers.'
Mr. BURCHAan.-Have yon any of that by you now? Witness.-No, Sir.
Mr. BURCISAmi. -What do you pay for your lodgings? Witness.-1Ss. a-week.
Mr. BURCsA,s.-You say you keep a servant. What do you pay her ?
Witues&s-10s. 6d. a-month. I have travelled with a lady 11 vweeks, and a little while ago I lived in Tenuison-street, York-road.
MIr. BUnCnAm.-What did you pay for your lodgings there ?
Witness.-A guinea a-week. No person came to see me there except a lady.
-Mr. Edvin.-Now, has any gentleman come to see you at 76, Stamford-street ?
Witness.-Only one, Sir. I met him at the Crystal Palace, and we went to the Lyceum Theatre. He wAs a perfect stranger to me.
Mr. BvrCHAs-Now, did not that gentleman go home with you?
Witness.-No, Sir. I went home by myself. I made an apunimtment to meet him a month afterwards at the Co.osseum, and I have seen him since frequently.
Jane Costa, the servant, was then called.-She said she received 10s. 6d. a-mouth, and had been in the service of the prosecutrix ton weeks. She generaUy went to bed at 10 o'clock, and never saw any gentlemen call on her mistress. She knew her to go out late at night, but she could not say whether she brought any gentlemen home with her. Witness believed her to be a respectable woman.
Mr. BuRCuAmr-Did you not think- it strange in her going out at 11 o'clock?
Witness.-I can't tell, Sir, as I go to bed early.
Mr. Bustc]Lui.-Don't you know that she is constantly going out late at night?
Witness (hesitating).-I do, Sir, and she has told me that she went to see a friend.
Mr. BuRcnAxA.-Male or female ? Witness.-I don't know Sir.
Several respectable tradesmen here came forward, and spoke in the highest terms of Mr. Gibson's conduct. He did considerable business on the turf for himself and gentlemen of property.
Mfr. BuVeACIS said that the evidence against the defendant rested entirely on the prosecutrix, and if it had been consistent he should have sent the case for trial ; bht after carefully investigating the whole of the circumstances and the cross-examination he was positive that no one could believe her, therefore it would be useless to send him before a jury. There could be no doubt astothe manner in which the prosecutrix gained her livelihood and the description of the house she lived in, and that she entered the cab with the defendant to take him home; hut she was disappointed. Under All the circumstances he must be discharged.
JohuLearyand Josiah Powvderhill, alia "Brighton Jesse," wvere finally examined, charged with assaulting Ann hhean, and stealing from her 151. in gold. The latter was also charged with robbing a gentleman of 50l.
MIr. Solomon attended to defend Shean.
On being sworn she stated that on Saturday morning, the 28th ult., between 4 and 5 o'clock, she went with the prisoners into two or three publichouses about the Boroughmarket when she had 15 sovereigns tied up in her handkerchief, which she concealed in her bosom. She had changed a sovereign to pay for gin and beer which she treated them and four or five others with. After that they all went into Slea and Pike's winevaults, opposite the Town-hall, when, feeling herself a little the worse for liquor, she thought it advisable to leave a portion of the money with Willams, the barman. As she was taking it out of her handkerchief PowderhiM seized her by the throat behind, while Leary snatched the money and handed it to his companion, who ran off. Witness, however, pursued Leary, and saw him stopped near the doorway by a police-constable, but the other escaped. He was, however, apprehended in Kentstreet at 7 o'clock the s,nme morning, when he attempted to maLe his escape.
Charles Llewenden, 228 M, said he was on duty in Highstreet, about 5 o'clock on the morning in question, when he saw Leary run out of the publichouse, followed by Shean, who called out " Stop him; he has robbed me." Witness caught hold of him and took him into custody, and on the way to the station-house Leary offered the woman 61. if she did not press the charge against him. At 7 o'clock Powderhill was apprehended in Kent-street, and he offered her 51. if she did not go to the station-house against him. After the charge was entered information was received that Shean had robbed a gentleman of 501. on the previous night, and he was in court to identify her.
The magistrate committed the prisoner for trial for steal.- ing the 151, arnd remanded Shean until Saturday to have the charge against her for robbing the gentleman of 601. investgated.
LksEr..mv-Michael Grant, a notorious card-sharper, who had been committed from this court in November last, for three months to tho House of Correction for a similar offence, was placed atWtha bar before hlr. HIIstRy, on a charge of gambling in a train on the South-Western PHailway, on Saturday last.
Mr. Francis Harrison Wright, a graduate of WVorcester Co'lege, Oxford, deposed that on Saturday morning last he took a second-class return ticket at she Waterloo station, for Mortlake, to see the boat race, and while the train was proceeding towards Putney he heard some person in the carriage offer to bet a shlling. This induced him to look towards him, and he saw the prisoner shuffle three or four cards and hold a shilling in his hand, which he offered to bet with a gentleman opposite that he did not find the Conrt card. The gentleman refused to bet a shilling, but said he had no objection to wager a penny on the event. This was accepted, and the gentleman picked out the Court card-the Queen of Spades or Clubs, but he (witness) could not positively say which, and the prisoner offered to pay him. The gentleman said he did not want, nor should ho take his money, but should give the prisoner into custody at the first station they came to. Two persons who were with the prisoner, and who evidently were his companions, began to bully the gentleman, told him he had no right to nor should he be justified in ginng the prsoner into custody, as he was equally guilty of the alleged offence in having played with him. They also said it was the custom to play cards in the trains going to Newmarket and other races, and therefore there could be no great harm in playing them on going to see a boat race. He (Mr. Wnght) here interposed, and said that he did not play with the prisoner, and certainly should
ie him into custody at the next station. By this time the train had reached the Putney station, and lie stopped in the camrage to prevent the egress of the prisoner while he sent for a pohceman. The prisoner's friends pushed radely past him aud got away, but, the station-master hang come up, he (witness) gave the prisoner into
Henry Saunders, a railway constable, said that while on duty at the Putney station on Saturday last the prisoner was given into his custody by the last witness on a charge of playing cards in the carriage. The prisoner admitted he ad played one game, and lost a penny, and begged hard that the gentlemen would let him go on account of his wife and three children. The gentlemen replied that they had read so much in the newspapers about card-sharping in railray carriages that they were determined to put it down or put a stop to it, and should appear bofore a magistrate to charge the prisoner. Wstne8s brought the prisoner to the Waterloo station by the next up train, and in the office of
him say that he had played but one gamne and lost a penny.
Inspector Bent said that between 11 and 12 o'clock on Saturday forenoon the prisoner was brought to Mr. Young's office, and on seeing himfs immediately after he sd, "IHallo. Glrant ait again?" when he replied, " Yes, Mr. Bent; I just played one .game,adolyfrapnny, iand Ihp

Mr. W. W. Yonisg, the staton-manaLge at the Waterloo station, Wid the company were most anxions to protect the public an'd their pawsngers from the practices or such perofns as the prisoner, and ahould be guided by the direction of his worship.
Mfr. HxNitY said, the evidenee at present was sufficient to send the prisoner to tehve Houtse ofCorrc iont vasfor three months, butt he should recommend that he be sent to the s- sions, when, on proof of the former cetiviction, the Court would bhDe enabled to send him feorr "12 months, and
The prisoner was remanded for that purpose.

The consulting engineer of this company, Lieutenau. t. Colonel Kennedy, has issued a seccond edition of his rero~rt to the shareholders giving an analysis of railway cons',ruc. %ion, snd explaining the measure adopted by him to secure
for them a good and remunerat ive railway at ai noderate I cost. The information. is of a practical char-acter and very interesting to the shareholders, HO enters At so me lengthL into railway management, the duties of directorr,- engineers, and shareholders and- gie arious detaii.a conneced with the construction of the railway, and, 'when comnplete, 'the mode of -working the traffic, 50 thaSt t%0 shareholders can readily comprehend the particxlars and bearinjs of the whole undertsking. He has als -embodied a vast amount of informaition. respecting the cest of-oeotruction of various railways in the united kingdom, varying from 2912,8971. per mile on the Blackwall to 4,901. ;per mile on the Levea Branch Ratilway. From tke table given it appears the average cost perade of 145 Tailwikys exceeded an average of 33OO,prasle, Of these 37 'railways had cost less than 11,0001. per mile, and 23 lines liess than 8,0001. per mile. Ead there ben a proper system of railway legislation and. ananagement the 2 7,0G00OfI. expended onL British railways ouightto have not onlyrompletedthe 8,200 miles, in the united kingdom, buat 16,000 mailes of colonial railway, and, instead of producing on -the average about 3A, per cent, per annum, 'the whole ouaght to have paid the shareholders 10 per cent. per anninn. le advert-t to the industrial capabilities of the Rindoos, and the great advantages that must arise to Great Britanis from the extension of the railway system in India. 'The expenditure of -capital in India on the construction of 'the Barodsa Railwvay would amount to only one-fourth of the 'total outlay, the other three-fourths being expended in Eosglsnd for rails, sleepers, engines, mnaterials, working stook, and ether saaters. He shows that supervision of Indian railways by the Government would require improve. mont,with view to aford geaterfacilities for

way ; and 16 1-3 years at the rate of progress made by the Madras Railway. The dividends to be advanced during con. struction, if the time as proposed for that purpose be two years, would amount to 12,6251., but if the timne of construction were extended to 25 years the interest would amount to 1,281,3751., the total estimatedl cost of the railway being, at 6,0001. a mile, 2,010,0001. ; but if they were permitted to construct the 385 miles of line from Bombay to Abhmedabad in two years the debt to the Government fur interest would be repaid in three years after the opening of the line for traffic, and if four years the debt couldt be liquidated in six years. He shows clearly that it is the interest of all parties 'that the worlzs should proceed as rapidlyas possible, and the lines he opened for traffic at the earliest period. Tables showing the advontagges of running from one to four trains each way, the ruling gradient being one in 500; the effects of gradients on loads of trains, and the effeots of velocity from 70 miles to seven miiles per hour, are shown by dliagrams. Ile states that the shareholders of this company have a guarantee of 5 per cent, per annum, provided -the revenue is sufficient to pay the working costs of the railway. It is only their power of r-eceiving dividends beyond 5 per cent, and extending them to the maximum rate of 10 per cent, that will he limaitedl to the surplus of revenue over working costs. If the revenue should not prove sufficient to pay the working costs and 5 per cent, dividends daring the term of the lease of 99 years as weilaasthe debt for advances, the Government must lose any balance they may pay of the 5 per cent, dividends, and the interest thereon. He states that if the revenue be insufficient to pay working costs and 10 per cent, dividends, the shareholders must lose to the extent of such deficienc
not covered by their guarantee of 5 per cent. Hence both the Government and the shareholders of the company have a common interest in the investigation and adoption of the soundest possible principles that shall insure the lowest rate of working costs in reference to the highest amount of traffic. Colonel Kennedy shows by means of diagramis that steep gradients are the most formidable enemies to low working costs and high dividends, and that high velocity is the second enemy to profitable working. The rulin gra-16 dient on the Baroda lie isl1in 500. He sttesta travellers in India who have been accustomed to make long journeys, of which the rate has been limited to 10 or 12 miles a-day on their ownx horses, or 20 or 30 miles a-day in palanquins, wil be delighted to find those rates accelerated to 20 miles an hour in railway trains. The calculation in the worling cost tables, given in the report, is based upon a rate of 20 miles per hiour for passenger trainis, and ten mniles for goods trains. Prudence suggests that these rates should nut be acceeratedl until experience shall have proved that the speed of passenger trains can be increased without bringing the dividend of shareholders below 10 per cent., or the fares and freights of lowest class goods and lowest class passengers above what would be suitable to the
resent limited means of the Indian population. Should the results be arrived at by the careful mode of procedure laid down in the report, he considers that the chief barrier to the improvement of the Indian empire will have been remnoved, conifidence wil have been established, and he has no dotubt that British capital will be freely invested in constructing Indian railways, without the necessity for any guarantee. From the results derived from the working cost table in the report it appears that the entire ordinary working cost on the Bombay and Barodla line, Nyaben running ,ons train daily each way, would slightly exceedI one-half of the guaranteed interest on the capital of 6,0001. per mile, and if the traffic should yield only one-sixth of the full load for one train in each direction daily, the working expense and renewal fund would be thereby covered ard the share. holders exonerated from the only possible contingency that can bring thieir dividends below 5 per cent., fares being for lowest class passengers one halfpenny per pasenger per aniile, and freight for lowest class goods one farthing per ten
ofr mile, or about half the, usual rates charged in England,
the traffic should yield only half a load for one train daily in each direction, the revenue would suffice to pay working costs, renewal fund, and 5 per cent. dividends to the shareholders onL their capital, thereby exonerating the Government from further payment of the guaranteed inteorest. If the traffic should yield two-thirds of a load, the revenue would suffice to pay all expenses and 71 per cent., and if the traffic should yield three-fourths of a load for one train daily in each direction, the revenude -would pay workisig costs, renewal fund, and 10 per cent, to the credit of shareholders, of which 2.1 per cent. would be p ad to Goveruniient until the liquidation of their debt, leaving the shareholders 71 per cent. during its liquidationi, and 10 per cent, afterw`ards. The contract limits the amount of net revenue to 10 per cent, on the outlay ; consequently a full load carried daily each way would reduce the freights and fares to three-fourths of these stated; if a full load for two trains a-day eaach way the fares for lowest class passengers would be reduced to one-eighth of a penny per ruie, and goods to one-eighth of a penny per toni per mile; and if the traffic approached a Fload for four trains each way daily, the lowest-class passengers and goods wtould be carried at one-sixteenth of a penny per mile, and per ton per mile respectively. This reduction wouild take place in order to keep the net profits of the railway w-ithin the limits of the 10 per cent, dividend. The report states that the miain trunk conceded to the company lies between Bomlbay and Baroda, and minist, in timne, receive the tributary traffic of at least eight important branches. In addition to the trunk portioni, the, Govrnniient have conceded to the company the imprtant main branch from Baroda to Ahmnedabad; but the Iome Governanent have stipulat-ed that the remnote portion between Sot-at and. Ahmedabad shaUl be executedl before proceeding with the construction of the most important pert between Bombay and Surat, notwithstanding that the directors, sanctioned by the views of the Governor-General in Council and the Governor of Bomnbay in Council, were strongly in favour of executing the whole 335 miles simnultaneously. The distance from Bombay to Surat is 180 miles, and fronsi Surat to Al1uaedabad 155 miles. It appears that the .335 miles could be nas easily conistructed and in as shortsa tiuie as either of its parts taken separat-ely, and if, either should bo done before the other, it ought to be that contiguous to the
ret commercial capitalI of Bombay. The directors were dresirous that the whole 335 miles should be executed in two years simultaneously. This principle would have had -the most beneficial effect upon the tratlic returns; the effect as regards economiy of construction WVould be 'still more striking in the saving of engineering and other expenses, and, more than all, of interest paid in dividends during construction.
In examnining the country for the railway and branches, it appears that 4,000 miles of line were surveyed in order to ascertain the beet lines in a comimercial, engineering, and Poritical point of view. The borings of river beds for hridges were very satisfactos, and the mode of passing the Vindiah xange to reach the tableLaud of Malwah and the States of Central India was the most favourable that could be desired ; -the direction of the range being parallel to the maLin linte 'would enable the company to obtain a gradual rise ouiaalong line of ascent from either Barzooch or Baroda to the summit at Tyrilla Gh&t. Fromi this point a line bad boon surveyed by Indore, Bhilsa, and JThansi to Agra, which line has been brought under the consideration of the Gov-ernor-Gleneral of India for approval as an extension line from Baroda, to formi a junc tion with the East India Railway goin 'from the north-west to Calcuztta.gon

The report of the directors of this company stated that the receipta on capital account to the 28th of February, 1857, amounted to S47,3a8,110f. (13,894,3241.), and the ex* penditure to 340,55L422f. (l13X22,0571.). leaving a balnee of 6,806.687f.(272,2671.). The length of the line in operation on the Ist of January, 18S6, was 1,053 kilometres; on the 2d of June the section from Argenton to Limoges, 107 kilo metres, was opened for traffic; and on the 17th of July the section from Poitiers to Niort, 74 Idlometres, was openedmaking the total length of railway worked by the company on the 31st of December last 1,234 kldometres (771 miles). On the line between Paris and Orleans the permanent way for a distance of 105 kilometres (66 wiles) was renewed at a cost of 2,709,726f (16S,3891.), after deducting the produce of the old materials. The whole of that sunm was charged to revenue. The expenditure for works and repairs in conseqnence of the inundations amounted in round numbers to 4,000,000f. (160,000l.).
The traffic receipts from all sources in 1856 amounted to 63,928,753f. (2,557,1501.), the working expenses to 28,525,347f. (1,141,0141.), theinterest on loansto 8,161905f.

Witchcraft In The Present Day.
WITCHCRAFT IN THE PRESENT DAY.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I send you the particulars of an application made to myself, as a magistrate, for an order to have a viteh "proved." All was written down by me at the tir, nd, as the date-last November-will prove, long befo,. F trial on witchcraft which you lately reported and remarke_ upon. The belief in witchoraft is very general among the poor, and not uncommon in a class above them. Mere ability to read and write does not counteract it. The believers in this case are very fairly educated, in a manner, but they still receive with unreasoning credulity the old wives' fables, handed down, as the applicant told me, "from generation to generation," and kept alive, no doubt, in each actual instance by knaves making their harvest of fools. In Mr. Andersson's interesting work, Lake G=ami, there are passages which are true of my own neighbourhood, though written of savages, e. g.-" The Namaquas, like most nations who are sunkin barbarism, have great faith in sorceries, and male and female witch-doctors play conspicuous parts. They are craftycreatures, and know how to take advantage of popular ignorance." Again,-" Dealers in the black art are numerous among the Bechuanas, who place implicit confidence in the prescriptions of wizards," &c. No Namaqua or Bechuana recipe can surpass my friend's mixture of " Liq. prop. ammon., noddlehair, toenails, fingernails, horse-shoenails; quant. suff."
Thus barbarism and civilization have alike their " cute 'ooons,"favouringtho darkness in which they fatten, to counteract whom should be the aim of those educational projects which we are so much discussing. It musb be useful at starting to sound the real depths of common igno. rance, and, if my communication will contribute towards it, you may depend on its correctness.
I am. Yours very obedientlv

I prtnL O.
" November 17, 1856.
J. B., who farms about 40 acres of land in the parish of Hockham, makes application to Mr. -, a magistrate, as follows :
"' J. B.-Your worship, I come to ask your advice concerning of my wife.
"Mr.-.-What's the matter?
" J. B.-Why, yorr worship, she's harassed about night and day-continual worrying-like wind teasing her stomach, and like a sow with all her young pigs a-pulling her to pieces.
"MhI-.-.-I don't see what I can do for that. Why don't you send for a doctor ?
"J. B.-Doctor, Sir? We've been to all the doctors abcout. We've spent every shilling to get remedy. All my family know it, poor dears. We're wholly done up.
" Mr.-.-StiU I don't see how I can help you.
'"J. B.-Well, Sir, it's thought by many people in the psrisb that my wife'sbewitched-* that it's put upon her
by evil-disposed persons throughn envy. There's a family named L-, who got turned out when we was put in, and we think it's through them that they set old Mrs. C. to
"Ur. -.-Who is Mrs. C.?
"J. B.-She's an old woman, your worship, who live near the Lion, and she have the character of being a witch, and I thought I'd stop down and ask your worship whether you would give me a grant to have her proved.
" Mr. -.-How is she to be proved?
"J. B.-Why, Sir, I thought you could have her swum. I've heard say that, if they be witches, and if you take a line (not to do them any harm, but just to swit 'em) then, if they be witches, they won't sink. I've heard say that there was a gentleman at - who had one swum in the river. I don't know exactly how it finished, but I heard she didn't live long after it. He bad it done right public. Her name was Pointer. They tied her clothes about her legs and used her decent. She had a line put round her waist, and one on each side, to keep her from sinking if she was an upright woman; but if she's a witch they can't sink her no how. Old Mr. L-, who done it, jumped upon her, but couldn't sink her no how ; when her head was down her heels was up, and when her heels was down her bead was up. Thoy do say, yo'r worship, that sick folks are increased about in the world, and if you have so many as even one in this or any other parish, they do a sight of harm. Almost every one who sees my wife says they never seed such a complaint, asd caU out that she's certainly bewitched. She fare (appear) hunted night and day. She fare dried up like a crisp. She say 'Will, I can't lie still-I might as well try to sink a bladder in water.' I do hope your worship will grant the police to take old Mrs. C. all of a sudden-by surprise like-and take her to a pit, and swimher (not to hurt her). If she's an uprigbt woman she'll sink, and if she don'r sink it'll prove her guilty.
" Mr,-.-According to this she won't gain much even if she is 'upright.' But now, B., seriously, how can you believe suec nonsense?
" (Here followed an argument, in which he brought forward the witch of Endor, the demoniacs of the New Testament5 &tc. It ended in the applicant being apparently 'convne agis hiswil
opinion still.'inst his wil," and, therefore, 'of t h same
"J. B. (returning to the charge).-Well, your worship, at least I hope you'll take her to a room, and have her stripped, and see if she have anything bad about her.
AfMr. -.-What is she likely to have bad about her?
"J. B.-Why, Sir, some say that they have imps about them, but I don't know.
" Mr. -.-What is an imp ?
" J. B.-I don't know, Sir, unless it be some bad spirit or other from the power of old Satan ; but I never seed one.
" Mr. -.-But now tell me why you fLx upon this poor old woman Mrs. C- in Particular ?
"TJ.B- Ill tellvyourworsbiphowwecomeatit. Mywifewas advised to send for the woman-, of -, who is wonderful clever in these things. Sho came and told us to take some psrticular liquid and put it in a bottle with some of the hairs out of the noddle of my wife's neck, and the parings of her finger nails and toe nails (these we cut quite close) and some old horseshoe nails. (These, you see, Sir, are little schemes which go from one generation to another, there's always something to be learned out of the weakest and ignorantest.) Well, Sir, we put the bottle on the fire, and we waits while it's boiiing and burning, and what not; and when it bursts we looks out of the window, and the evil-disposed person stands before us. Last Friday night was a month that my wife did this ; and after she done it she got out of bed, as she do sometimes, to take a drop of
rin or a little megnesia, and she looked out of the window, and there she saw the woman C- standing before the window, at a most unsealable honr, in the moonlight, in an agony sort of state.
"Ir.-.-What became of her?
"J. B.-I don't know, Sir; my wife got into bed, and I suppose someone come and took the woman away. We have not seen her since, but our girl says that she has heard her rattling at the door.
Mr. -.-Well, -I can't listen any more to such nonsense.
" J. B.-Ask the squire's gamekeeper, Sir, and ask Tom T., steady, not fast-talkingmen. Let the squire call these men before him. Cive me them writings if you please, Sir, and let me take them to thedergyman and the squire. We wished to come to you first.
" Mr. -.-I have merely i een writing down what you said, but you must not trouble the squire about such rubbish.
"J. B.-Sir, if our squire knew that there was any such bad things as witcheraft in the parish, he would have it altered; because, you know, Sir, 3?haveto pay the rates and taxes, hard and fast.
"Mr. -.-I really can't lsten to you any longer.
".J. B.-What, Sir ! amn't gou going to have At proved? Can't you at any rate have her hitched to the Union Eouse?
Tat might be a benefit.
adMir.i, *-.I will snake inquiries, and will do wlknt iE
LExit atpplicant, protesting against anything short of fol? 'Proof by dr swimming her."]
The district policemanl bas since infomrzut )p- that .
On a certain aight he was asked by J. B. to come and wlatch his premises, under pretence that his ducks were stoen. He did so, but discovered afterwards that they weere " wvorking their spel," ana they wanted him to see the witch appear. He saw no one. The old woman C. is hamless and respectable, and so infirm that she cannot possibly have been so far as J. B.'s house for a very long time past. The * bewitched" woman herself has since described to me what she saw-viz., the woman G -, "whinaying" like a dog shut up, not bLrldng nor howling, but " whinnying," and moving her hands like a dog's paws when sitt-ng up. Mrs B- told me that she knew aU her afflictions to come from God, but she does not understand why He sends suchl persons as the witch to witness them. A few days afterwards I was in a cottage
parish, when I made some observation trange, thigs that people believed even in these days," to which the wommn of the cottage replied that sbe supposed I was alinding to Mr.B-, of D-, and to her being bewitched. I said that I was thinkinugof that,
" Mrs. F-.-Well, Sir, there certainly is such things. " Mr. F- (her husband).-There certainly is.
tMre. F-.-Why, Sir, only lat Monday was a week, that there witch sent poor Mrs. B- up to the top of the house, and then up the haystack, and then on to the horses, and made her even follow the plough on them. 'Twas aU done first from jealousy. The people who could not have the land were determined that those who did get it should not enjoy it, and so they set this old witch to disturb them.
M Mr. -.-But I am told that Mrs. G- is a most harmless, inoffensive woman.
"M Ir. F-.-Ah, Sir, that's where they overcome people -so loving and fond, with their Judish tongue to ctray people; and they come ssking for butter, and cheese, and mils, and all such things, and no one dares to deny them.
-Mmr. --.-Bnt Mrs. C- is so infirm that she could not possibly have got so far as B--'s farm.
" Mrs. F-.-Well, Sir, God knows. It was eithor she or her shadow. I should not like to have anything to do with such t and Mr B-'s mistake on that there Friday night wss t'imat he s;cokto her. If he hadn't spoke to her she'd have died, and then they'd have been rid of her. I s
Sir, you've heard of Mrs. S-'s case-the wife of S- the sheep.dresser, of G-7
"M Ar. -.-No, I have not heard of it.
" Mrs F.-No more had I, Sir, till a ferw da-s ago, when my neighbour, Uts. P-, asked me, 'laveyouheard,' says she, 'thattheman S-of G- haskiltawoman?' 'Kilt a woman?' says I,-' Yes,' says she-' a rwilh.' And then I heard allabout it, just as tman S---himself had told Mrs. P-'s husband the day b.)efore, and the whole thing has only Lately happened.
" Mr.-.-What is it ?
" Mrs. F.-Well, Sir, this man A -- S- - w 3ife w bewitched by a woman that lived nezt dc-i' - am so was his pigs, and pony, and other thug. - a, never get his pony out of the stable n ,s. .'q
move the spelL (I suppose they have; M power atop things in that way, and to set tbeTn free His wife, when sbe went to get into bed, was set f.w.'. - that she could move neither one way nor another. _:J would half dress herself, and then could not get the things either more on or off. Her husband was advised to go to the cunning woman ab P,-. He went. As soorn as she saw him come in she said, ' I know who you are and what you're come about. You ara bewitched at home.' She then went into another room and brought out some large draughts (drawings). She showed him one, and said, ' Do you know that cottage ' ' Yes. that's mine.' ' Yes, and here lives the woman that has bewitched you, with her daughter; and here's her face (likeness). Go you home and as soon as you get home they will come in; but don't you speak to them, nor don't let your wife speak ; and if you neither of you speak she will go home and die.' The man S- went home. The witch came as usual and began to talk to them. Neither spoke, She got up in an agony, went into her cottage, and
arpped dead.+ ier daughter then came in to them. Un. Inchly, they spoke to her, and therefore she did not die, as she certainly wauld have done. That's the mistake that the other man, B-, of-, made;* he spoke to the witch.
" Mr.-.-What a wonderful story! He certainly 'kilt his witch,' as your neighbour says.
" Mrs.F--. Yes, Sir- he did. I could teU you whyshe first set about bewitching Lim, for they was at one time friends. Mr. S. has not been married very long. When he was married he gave a party, and invited thi woman and her daughter. He was sily enough to give all the com. pany jalap in their drink, and then locked them in. These two were dreadfully offended, and nothing went right with him afterwards. Since her death the man's wife has been all right, and so has everything else.
"Mr. -.-ButMrs. F-, do youseriously believe such things, or do you not think that God rulesthe world?
"Mmr F--Idobelieve that there arethesebad-spirited people, Sir. Ladies and gentlemen don't often hear much about such things. I believe that the Almighty gives them up; and that, as we pray for grace and wisdom and strength to serve Him, so these people pray to the enemy to give them power to dothese evilthings. God has promised His help to the smallest believer who hangs on Him; and they pray to the devil to give them their badness, and he gives it to them; and he (the devil) have as much power over these people as the AImighty have over His own.',
"M Mr. -.-But, Mrs F-, this represents the devll as stronger than the Almighty, if he can give people ' badness' with which they can go about persecutingGod's own people, even in all their temporal concerns and in their boiy health.
"Mrs.F-.-Ibelieve, Sir, it is done; but, of course, God can set bounds to it. The Lord he only know aU about these things; but I know this, Sir, that when I was a girl there was a witch lived next door to us, and afraid enough we was of her.
" Mr. -.-What did she do?
"Mrs.F-.-HernamewasBetsy Norris. Shebewitched my father's cows and pigs and geese, and other people's, too, when they offended her. All the farmers was afraid of her, and gave her anything she asked for; if not, she could make all their things run wild over the yard, and could fiLl them with lice, which went and came according as she were pleased or not. The first of my father finding her out was one day when she cur up his onions. He went after her and said he would ' spurn her.' He gave her a kick, but he never felt nothing for his toe - his foot sunk in as if she weant made of nothing human - and yet, when he kicked her, that there old woman flew yards and yards. And then, when he went home, my father found his pigs bewitched. They was barking and jumping aLl over the stye. MEy father cut a piece off their ears and tails, and raked them up in the fire, and told my mother to go up stairs, and to be sure not to speak to the witch if she should come. The witch came hillooing to the door. ;sking rsy mother fdor sodme ras She had her fingers cut all across,
MIr. -.-W ho had cut her fiugers?
"Mrs. F-.-Why, Sir, the enemy caused her to do that herseLf when myfather stirred the pigs' tails and ears in the fire, and told my mother to go upstairs. Then that wrought upon her, and she cut her fingers in that there dreadful way. My mother was a muir-hearted woman, and as the witch stood screaming and begging for rags my mother looked out of the window and gave her some rags, and spoke to her. By so doing mymother gave the power out of her own hands, and the witch got the power again; whereas, if my mother had not spoken to her she would have gone homa and died. Ah ! Sir, as I said before, there's the mistake-to speak to them.
" Mr. -.-Well, what became of her at last?
" Mrs. F-.-We had her in our parish for years and years; and once a woman named Huggins, a wonderful strong woman, swore she would try whether Betsy Norris was a witch or not. She took and put her on to a faggot and shoved her into a pond, and turned her over and over with a pitchfork, but she came up again ever time, and swam like a duck or a goose. At last they put her into the workhouse, and there she bewitched a whole heap of other women and filed them with lice.
" Mr. -.-Well, any dirty old woman could do that.
"M. F.-Yes, Sir; bat Betsy Norris was very clen, and it was the power she had from the Enemy that done that, and she could make them come and go at any moment. At last she died, and her body swarmed with them, and after the grave was shut up there was not one left in the house."
P.S.-March 23, 18.57.-This day the bewitcbed woman herself caUed to ask advice as to consulting an astrologer for her complaint. She is evidently under mental delusions, and therefore it would not usefuUy ilustrate the subject to repeat her many absurdities,
On inqury7 I found that no such sudden death took place at this
cottage. and that witch No. 2, Is till alive.

Barkly on board, was notified to the inhabitants of Melbourne by the discharge of artiUery about 10 o'clock in the evening of the 23d of December. His Excellency the acting Governor, several members of the Executive and Legislature, were at the time patronizing the flte given at Cremorne in aid of the Soldiers' Daughters' Fund, but on the announcement of the arrival of the new Governor they took their departure. As soon as possible after arrival Sir Henry intimatea his desire that his entry into Melbourne should be IS quietla and as privately arranged as possible, and accordingly thn hasty preparations previously made Jhr his official receptioy were considerably curtailed. As the anchorage in the bay was effected the bloekahip, under the command of Lieu. tenant Crawford, R.N., fired a Governor's salute of 17 guns. The Colonial Government steam-sloop Victor:n fired a succession of rockets, and lighted the yards of the ship so as to afford the pilot some assistance in bringing the ship amonz the vessels in the bay. Some few rockets were fired and bluelights burned by the Morning Star, Medway, Marcj Polo, and other vessels im the port. At an early hour oa the following mrnoing his Excellency, accompanied by the acting Governor and Mr. Childers-the latter of whom had prooceded on board the Oneida on the previous night-disembarked at Sandridge, and was conveyed ia General M'Arthur's carriage to Toorak. An escort of Her Majesty's 40th Regiment was supposed to have been il readiness to-escort Sir Henry, but, as with aU the intended preparations, were a trifle too late. The eye-witnesses of the
ndng and departure consisted of very few persons. Sir Henry's 4esire fow privacy and early movements, however, sufflciently account ior this. It is a good omen to find that Sir Henry Barkly 'had won golden opinions of al on board by his affable bearing, and amiable and unobtrusive demseanour. If he be lsdlf as well liked by the good people of Victoria as by those on board the Oneida he will be ponular indeed. Sir Henry Barkly held his first levee on the st of Janaary, in the Exhibito.n-building. The attendance was very large. Addresses were presented from both Houses of Parliament, from tle Municipal Council, the ministers and members of the Free Presbyterian Chureh, tho Synod of Victoria, the Wesleyan Church, the Episcopal Church, the committee of the Melbourne Benev.,l, -nt Asylum, and the Municipal Councils of Willianstown s)_d East Collingwood. The HeraZd says that Sir Henry Barkily's vmistentatious ebaracter augurs wel for his futre sucte .AutraZian and Nesso Zealand Gazette.
