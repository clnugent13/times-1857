Oar advices from Malta reach to the 31st of July, and mention the arrival, on the 19th at Genoa, from Lisbon, of the Princess Royal, ancdher departure on the 20th tojointhe squadron under Lord Lyons, which has, it is stated, received orders to retrace its way to Malta, where it was looked for duDrng the following week. The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steampackets Colombo arrived at 5 p.m. in 67 hours, and the Nectis at n 30 p.m. un 77 hours, on the26th, from Alexandria. The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamer Indus arrived at alta on the 30th from Southampton and Gibraltar, and was awaiting the arrival, hourly expected, of -lie Valetta from Marseilles, with the overland London mlail. The Lords of the Admiralty on Wednesday visited the powder works at Bull Point, in Hamoaze, inspected the guardship in ordinary, the Royal William, 120, Captain Woodford J. Williams, 'lag of AdmiralPlumridge, muslered the artisans in the Devonport dockyard,. examined that establishment, and the new stem yard at Keyham. In Devonport dockyard the only ships building are the scres steam-frigate Topaz, expected to be launched in two months, and the screw steamship Donegal, 101, which may be launched during the present year. The Narcissus, a fourth-rate, is lengthening-it may be said rebuilding-for a 50 gun screw. The screw steamship St. Jean d'Acre, 101, is being re stored for the steam reserve, after being nearly prepared for the reception of the' Atlantie telegraph wire. The Creole, 26, sixthrate, is altering for an advance ship, and the sailing ships Loedon, 90, and Acoulcir, 90, ace both receiving the srew . Rhe basin containe the screwsrtteam corvette Pelo. .ru>S,1, andE crew lrsin gunvesse [5bowe%irg gunboats Sldpjacks and Forward, prep'aring for sea. The only new work in progress is the south smithery, which ha's been two years in hand-it measures 160 feet long by 120 broad and willbe ready foruse in a few mdths; the sAw mis adjoining, which are 120 feet square, are equally forward. At Keyham steam-yard the 40,0001. granted for the current year has been all expended towards the completion of one of the finest Government foundries in existence. The chief portion has been laid out on the great quadrangle, which, with the buildings, has a roofage of seven acres. It is 900 feet long by 480 broad. Since their Lordships were there last year the engine smith-shop, south, has been completed, including the erection of a Nasmyth five-ton steam hammer, and several of lesser Ipower. Irx the north end of the quadrangle the oil. smiths' shops and stores and the furnaces are in a forward state. The larger foundry is in use; it has four powerful traveUers, constructed on the tubular principle, each weighing 22 tons, and tested to the extent of lifting 30 tons; the side walls are equally armed, having foar cranes, eacb tegted to 30 tons, and four or five others with lesser power to suit the various requirements. The gas pipeq are laid on, and there are two furnaces and a drying stove attached. North of the foundry are the usual pattern smiths' shop, trimming shop, iron store, pug mill, blast, &c., all put up, and north of these again, to drive all the machinery, is a 50-horee engine, similar to the one on the south. The boiler shop on the north end of the quadrangle is nearly complete, the cranes and traveUers are up, and the pavement and gas could be finished in a month. The Govermment have not yet availed themselves of all the land they possess on the north, and the tidal basin has therefore not obtained its full proportions, Negotiations are pending with the St. Aubyn family for the purchase of 50 additionaacres, and with the Duchy of Cornwal for a frontage of 5(. acres of mud. This may involve an outlay of 100,0001 Space would be obtained for a dock suitable for the increased length of the new war ships, for a barrack to save the mili tary guard their long and tiresome march before commencing duty, and, what may be of more consequence than either, for a siding into the new Cornwall Railway, which will thus also open direct communication with the Sontt Devon, Bristol and Exeter, and Great Western lines. No. I dock at Keyham, which took the Himalaya with not a inch to spare, is being lengthened 12 feet, and now con tains the screw steamship Doris, 32, 800-horse power, th first of her class in Devonport, preparing for oommission. No. 2. dock has the screw steamship Exmouth, 90, whicl was taken in on Monday, her stem has received extra sup porting shores, to facilitate the repairs of her keel and false keel, recently damaged by grounding on the Land's-end on returning from Lisbon, and in No. 3. (the Queen's do6lek is the screw steamship Nile, 90, refitting. The Lords of the Admiralty will probably leave Plymoutb this morning for the coast of Dorsetshire and Spithead. The screw steomship Imperador, CommanderJ. B. Atkins, belonging to the South American Steam Company, from Liverpool, arrived at Plymouth yesterday morning to enbhrk marines for China. The screw steamship Sarah Sands, surveyed some time back by Government surveyors, and rejected in consequence of not being ready at the time, has been since thoronghly completed, and fitted in every department by the owners, Messrs. Walton and Sons, and has been taken up by tbe East India-house for the conveyance of troops to India. She was again surveyed on Tuesday by the company's surveyors and an Engineer officoer of Woolwioh dockyard. In consequence of the Sarah Sands having been in dock some time, It was considered necessary to institnte' a general examination throngh the various compartments and machinery of the vessel, and, having been tested and put under steam, she was pronounced efficient through out. She will leave the Victoria Dock to-day for Sonthampton. Her nominal burden is 1,200 tons. The Bast India Company have succeeded in chartering the 14 undermentioned first-class screw steamships-the Prince Arthur, Carthage, Caledonia, Thebes, Robert Lowe, Scotland, John Bell, United Kingdom, Victoria, Sydney, Australian, Golden Fleece, Lidy Jocelyn, and Sarah Sands, the majority of which are already under way, besides about an equal number of sailng ships of heavy tonnage; and they are negotiating and surveying for the hire of a further number. Lieutenant-Colonel Walhb, Lieutenant Travers, and a Eergeant-major of the Ist battalion Royal Marines, proceeded to Chatbam yesterday from Woolwioh for the purpose of embarking with thot detachment under orders for ihina.

The rowig began at a little before2, and was kept up at regular intervals until half-past 6 in the evening. The sport commecoed with THru SCCLLElIS' RACE, GO2 TO TlE WORLD.

The greatest interest i manifested in thaeresit. - It appears to be admitted on all hands that Mr. Bright in the ablest candidate proposed; but local objectiona operate against his election. The gunmakers, lioensed vIctu4lers, retail brewers, combined with the great Conservative party, are exercising a powerful adverso influenoo antd the resdlt is consequently extremely doubtfuL Mr. Baron Webster aud his friends sate unequivocaly that their wish is to exclude Mr. Bright from the reprBes ta tion, but that at the same time if, upon a oomparison of the results of their respective canvassee, they re foand to be the weaLer'srty, rather than ir.

?ARLIAMENTARY I1NTELLIGENCE; HOtISE OF LORDS, THURSAY, AUGuS 6. rPI3-v l7TkTf4 AV ^-V Lord CAMPBELL said he had just received a petition 'which he felt it bis duty to present, in older that it might be generally known that their lordohips were ready to hear the petitions of all persons who addressed them with proper respect. The petition came from the Queen of Oude, the eldest EOn, and the brother of the King of Onde. They expres ed the deepest pain and regret at the news recently received from the East Indies of the general defection of the troops in the Bengal Presidency, and they went on to state their surprise at its being supposed that their relative th3 3ing of Oude had been at all concerned in that movement. They denied all complioiy in it on the part of the Sovereign? and they said they felt conadentfrom assurances they received from hin that he was entirely innooent of the charges brought agTnst hlm; that all the members of the Royal far ily of,ode were faithfully attached to the connexion with Great Bzitain, and that for the redress of any wrongs they thought they had suffered they only looked to the Queen and Parliament of Greatt Britain. The prayer o- the petition -was that lt might be isclosed to the King of Oude 'what charges 'were made against him and that they night have the opportutnit of prosing his innocence and of corJresponding vith himb. He had done his duty in presenting the pcetition, hut he must express his confidence that t~he Government of India in 'what they had done in the matter referred to had acted with perfect propriety. Be individually had entixe confidence in their twisdozn in that respect, but at the same time it gave bhm satisfaction to -witness this testimony from the Royal family of Oude of their devoted attachment to this country, azd he sbould rejoice ik the cbarges against the King of Onde should prove to be unfounded. Lord ST. LEONARD'S trused It would not be supposed from the petition being laid on their lordships table that any injustice had been done to the Sing of Oude. He had sufficient confidence in the East India Company and the Government of India not to acquiesce in the aertion that the King of Oude had been 4improperly treated. Lord CAMPBELL said he had guarded himself against being supposed to assent to that assertion when he expressed his confidence that the Government of India had acted with perfect propriety. At the same time he added that all who approached their lordships respeotfully should have the opportunity of being heard. The petitioners expressed the greatest devotion and affeotion to this country. Lord REDESDALE noticed that the word "humble" 'was not attached to the petition, and their lordships never received a petition unless it was described as the humble petition of the undersigned. Lord CAMPBELL said that If there were any technicality of that sort in the way of the reception of the patition he would withdrw it. The petition was accordlngly vwithdrawn. Lord CAMPBELL also presented petitions from the Lord Provost and town council of Edinburgh and from ths Chamber of Comamrer of Bdinburgh against the Lunatics (Scotland) Bill; likewise a petition from the town council of Edinburgh against the Court of Sessiox (Scotland) Bill. The Duke of BUCCLEUCH preented a petition from 2nerchants bankors, and traders in London, aud from owners and occupiers of property on the banks of the Thames against tho Thames Conservancy Bill The Bill was read a third time on Tuesday, but by some accident the petition did not reach his hands until afterwards. Lord ST. LEONARD'S said he had had charge of the Bill, and he took care that all the proper rights of the owners and occupiers of property shouldibe preserv6d. B3ANKIG BILL. Lord ST. LEONARD'S was understood to complain that this Bill had been read a third time rather by surprise on Tuesday last and that he had been thus preveated from proposing the insertion of two clauses which he thought it of importanoe to introduce. One of the clauses which he wished to insert was intended to provide that joint-stock banks should be compelled to publish their accounts as they were at present, and the other had reference to banks in Ireland. fle very much lamented that the Bill should have been so hurried through the Eiouse, and that he should have been prevented moving the amendments in question. Hitherto there had been but one code applicab(e exclusively to joint-stock banks; they were now about to sweep away the whole of that law, and to make joint-stock banking companies sub:ect to all the laws and regulations affecti jointstock companies generally. This was a great alteration to effect by a measure of this nature, andheventured to say that very few of their lordships were aware of the nature of its enactinents.*Underit any seven persons might establish a Joint-stock banldng company with 1001. each subscribed but not Id. paid. They might advertise themselves as being incorporated under this Act some fine day, and then unfortunate people in all parts of the country would be swindled out of their property, and would be deprived of alU those safeguards which they had hitherto possessed. Lord STANLEY of ALDERLEY reminded the noble and learned lord that on two former occasions he had poetponed this Bill for the noble and learned lord's expreEs con-venience, and that on Monday night he informed him that he could not postpone it any longer, because the session was getting on, and if these measures were postponed indefinitely from time to time it wonld be impossible to Pass them. With referenoe to joint-stock banks in Ireland he told the noble and learned lord that a clause o effect the object which he had in view had been introduced by the Attorney-Genervi for Ireland in the oth r House, and he stated that if that clause did not carry out to the full extent the wish of the noble and learned lord another might be introduced for the purpose. With regard to the other clam he (Lord Stanley) statedthat the Bill 'was intended to assimilate the law with respect to joint-stock bankstotheJoint5stookCompeiesAostofl year, with this utugl'e, a wber., k m . ,I.r the Act of last year mnight be formed with limited liability banks would continxe to be formed, as they had always hitherto been,a under unlimited liability. With regard to the publication of accounts, he stated that that was not required by the Ioint-stock Companies Act of last year, to which banks were, under this Bill, to be assimilated in every particulr, excepting that of liability. He added that he coneidered the pubhcationof accounts to be completelyfallacious, and that it enabled theBritishBankl,tbeTi peraryBank and every swinding concernwhich hadfailed of late yearsto bear upon their face an assumption of security which it was so far from affording that it only deluded the public who confided in them. on the whole, he thought it desirable that there should be no compulsory publication of accounts, although the shareholders might, i they deemed it advisable for the sake of security, by their memorandum of association, require it s one of the conditions of the company. If it -were thought that such publication wfould add to the security of the concern, and 'would inspire confidence in the public, no doubt the shareholders and directors of most banks which desired to obtain such confidence would take measures for the publication of their accouts. The subject then dropped. 'The Ilicit Distillation (Ireland) Biul and the Bural A cts Amendment Bill were, on the motion of Lord REsDESDAx, read a first time. Keay's Divorce Bil passed through committee. MILITIA BILL, On the order of the day for the second reading of this B3ill, The Marquis of SALISBURY expressed a hope that every encouragement would be given to enlistment from the militia into the line. (Hear.) He believed that very many militir.imen who had served for some years would be extremely glad to seize the opportunity of entering into the army if proper inducements were held out to them. The Duke of RICHMOND quite agreed with the noble marquis that it was most desirable to hold out every encouragement to militiamen to volunteer if their services were nired in tho line. At present these men could not be ro=lsted umtil after the expiration of their time of service. Now, it would be very desirable that officers commandin_ militia regiments should be empowered to make a bargain with the men two or three months before the end of their term. A capital opportunity would be afforded in the course of this autumn, when the bounty was paid to the men, to persuade them to enter the line, and he hoped that commandit,g officers throughout the country would think it their bounden duty te promote enlistment of this kind to the utmost extent of their power. (Hear, hear.) Lord PANMURE had listened with great gratification to the remarks of the noble marquis and the noblo duke, coninected as they were with the militia, and anxious M they seemed to be to promote enlistment into the line regiments. It was certainly most desirable that at any partcular emergency of this kind as many men as possible should be iAduced to enter into the regular service. At the present mnoment there wa8 some little difficulty in allowing men who had n^ot been six months in the militia, or who had nu, gone through some degree of training, to volunteer for the Rie without paying back the militia bounty. His PIoyal Highness at the head of the army had, however, arranged that any militiamen who had served six months, or who had been out at one training, should be exempted from this repayment. [So we understood. A " private" conversatio, carried on at the bar quite overwered the noble lord's voice, and mightfarmre easil)yave been reported.] It 'was not desirable that raw recruits should tass from the miit nto the line. That 'was not just to te commanding Oicers of lmne regiuents, and was a thing to be discouraged as much as possible. Itwas, however, highly desirable ton procure troops for er Majesty's service in order India; and the Coimnianderdin.Chief, therefore, in addition to the ordinary maohinery of the recruiting service, had givendietionsto the permanent staff of the militia to assist in their various districts the efforts made to prooure men. At this season of the year he anticipated that in many counties they would soon begin to reap the fruits of this arrangement, and as the harvest concladed he hoped a coonsiderable body of men would be enlisted for the service of the country. With reference to the remarka of the noble duke, he would look into the militia laws and would see 'whether any legal provision was required in order to -re.enist men before their time of service expired. He quite agreed that it was desirable to give power to the command. iDg officers to enter into arrangements with the five years' service iaen, if they came to receive their bu,nnty, two or three months before the expiration of their term ; and if sny such provision were necessary he should not hestate to ask Parliament to accede to it. (lear.) The Duke of CAUBRIIDGE.-I have hexrd with much satisfaction the sentiments expressed by my noble friends as to the necessity of giving every faoility to volunteers from the militia into the line. That the militia is one of tho mainstays of the army In times of e muergency like the present there can be no doubt whatever; and as the officers in command of militia regiments, whether embodied or not, must have great power over their several corps, it is most Fatifying to me to hear my noble friends, as two colonels of militia, so 'warmly expressing their opinions in favour of encouraging enlistment into the line. (Hear.) I feel confident Ahat the same feeling will pervade the whole militia force of the country, and I cannot too strongly impreu upon all commanding offiem of that force the vat imporenoe of encouraging their men to enter the regular aervice on tbis coca. slon. (Hear, hear.) Circumstances of a grave chacter have called a coniiderable portiAo of Her Majesty's Soroes fronm this country, aad it now becames our duty to fill up the reserves of the] army. (Hear, hear.) No army, however oomplte and efficient in the field, can be regarded a in a satisfactory position If it has not considerable reserves to draw upon at all times; and tbis is more especially the case when we remember the climate of India, withi which it is peculiarly diflioult for Europeans to cope. At the same time I feel the greatest confidence ia the exertions which will bo made by the country-exertions which were so conspicuous on a recent ocecason, and which I believe will certainly not now be withheld. (Cbeers.) I may also express my cordial approval of the power taken by the Government in the present Bill to embody the militia ahould the circumstanoes of the country require it, It is necessary that every one should put his shoulder to the wheel, and I must repeat therefore my gratification at the spirit displayed by my noble friends, and my con. viction that every possible support will be afforded us by the country. (Cheers.) The Duke of BUCOLEUCH said that no one could be more anxious than he was to offer every assistance for the promotion of enlistment from the militiu into the line, and ne suggested that his noble friend (Lord Panmure) should, with as ittle delay as possible, send circulars to the oficers commanding mlitia regiment3 stating exactly what woould be allowred with zegard to volunteers for the ikne. Definite information of this kind would very munch acilitate reenlistment. (HIear.) The Bill wfas then read a second time. FRAUDULENT TRUSTEES, Au., BILL. The House then went into committee on this BilL Clauses from I to 11 inclusive were agreed to. On claume 12, which provided that a prosecution under this Bill ahould be gsactioned by one of the judges or by tb Attorney-General, The LORD CEANCELLOR proposed to amend the clause by driking out that part of it referring to the jadges, because it might happen that a trustee eharged with fraud mght be trie before the very judge who had sanctioned the institution of criminal proceedings gainst him. Lord CAMPBELL approved the amendment, and expressed an earneat wish that in other branches of the law tho sanction of some public offloer might be necessary before criminal prosecutions were instituted. He had frequently observed that the most frightful abuses arose from the faoihties which were given to private prosecutors, without any notice whatever to the parties accused, to prefer bills of indicnment and inimediately obtain warrants thereon. That was the case particularly with regard to charges of gerjry and conspiracy. Those indictments were frequen y pro. ferred for the sake of extortion. If some public functionary were responsible for the institution of those proceedings it would be ' a great improvement in our crimina jarisprudence. He had a good deal of conversation with the late Attorney-General, Sir A. Cockburn, on the subject, and his learned friend had made up his mind to propose a Bill to remedy the eviL He hoped that a Bill of ths,t nature would ere long reoelve the sanction of the Legislature. For the present he thought it was highly desmrable that no person should be liable to any prosecution for breach of trust without the previous sanction of a public functionary. Lord ST. LEONARD'S briefly expressed his concurzrece in the omission proposed by the Lord Ohancellor, On the question that the clause as amended stand part of the Bill, Lord WENSLEYDALE proposed the omisdon of the entire clause, because he thought that it would lead to great abuse. By the commnon law every individual had a right to go before the grand jury and ask for periission to prosecute any one who he thought had inflicted upon him an injary punishable under the criminal law. That privilege was one of the distinctions between this and foreign countries. In them no criminal prosecution could be commenced without the interference of the Executive, and therefore for the accomplishuhent of party purposes or for the gratification of individual animofity4 the Govtrument and the offioers of the Government Lad ample opportunities. There were, no doubt, cases in which it was desirable and necessary that the institution of criminal prooeedings should be vested in anofficer oftheCrown; but this Bill diLd not directly conceta the public, it had merely reference to wrongs committed on private individuals. The law relating to trustees was now clearly defined, and no such provision as this was necessary, He therefore hoped that their lordahipe would omit the clause. The LORD CHANCELLOR said, the gzeat evil which was apprehended from this Bill by the other House w&3 that, while it would punish those who had been gilty of fraud, it would also deter honest men from undertking the duties of trustees. This objec. tion was obviated by the introduction of the safe. guard afforded by this clause. It was made anecessary preliminary to the institution of a prosecution for what would constitute an entirely net offence that the proceed. ings should have the sanction of a high functionary familiar with the subject, who would see whether the case fairly came within the purview of the law Lord ST. LEONARD'S, whble subscribing to the views expressed by his noble and learned friend (Lord Wensley. daue), still tbought this clause one which their lordships might safely adopt. It was a peculiar provision, calculated to meet a peculiar set of circumstances. It would prove to honest trustees that a faithful performance of their duties exposed them to no real danger. Lord CAMPBELL felt strongly that the case contemplated by the clause justified an exception being made to thA sAnTralA le -. There ought to be,son,_. ,he kui " vexatiouis and rash prosecutions; ana no evil was likely to arise from vesting the proposed discretionary power in the Attorney-General. His noble and learned friend (Lord Wensleydale) seemed to be under unnecessary alarm on this score. At present no writ of error could be brought without the sanction of the Attorney-General, who also had it in his power to put a stop to the execution of the criminal law. If, however, that functionary abased the authority in. trusted to him bv law for wise purposes h Was lible to be called to account, and even to be punished. Lord WENSLBYDALE objected to a practice hitherto unknown in the constitution of this country. The offence in question was one commnitted against a private individual, ana wrhy should he be debarred froma bruin&g his case before a grand jury ? The clause wss then agreed to without a division. The remaining clauses were also agzeed to, and the HouFe sesumoed. TRUSTEES RELIEF BILL. This BiU went through committee. TRANSFER OF REAL ESTA.TE SIMpLIFICATIONX BILL. On the order of the day for the second reading of this Bill, Lord ST. LEON ARDS said that he could not e t at solateaperiod of the session to beablo topas thiBill into lav, but, ea he had been somewhat msunderstood when he hd addressed their lordships on a former occasion, le wished in a very few words to stato what were the visions of the measure. He was awiare that the noble lord who had presided over the commision which had been appointed to inquire into the subject proposed to introduce a Bill next year, founded on the recommendation of that commson, which was based upon a principle of registration; and a noble and learned friend of his (Lord Brougham) had somevwhat anticipated that measure by himself introduCing a Bill 'which recognized that principle. Now, the object of the present BiUl was to render a system of registration whoUy unnecessary. TheBilldealtwiththe present system as regardedporpetuity, and amended and explained the present law. It proposed also to reduce the period of 40 years of uninter rupted possession, which thelaw at presnt recognised as givnmg a valid title, to 25 years, and it renderes it unnecessary to includein a conveyance abstracts of title for more than 40 years back. At present a registered judgment might be executed against a purchaser any timae after the purchasehad been completed, but he proposed that when tbere was a bond ftde purchase no purchase should be attached upon a judgment or Crown debt unless execution issued before the parcuase was completed. The Bill also provided for the exemption of parchasers from the succession duties, and it enabled trcstees to give a perfect dscharge to pu;rchasers from any claims upon the propertv The last pnroposition was to make any seller, agent, or soliCitor concealing an eacumbrance with a fraudulent intent liabl4s to punishment as being guilty of a misdemeanour, and he believed such a pronision would be found to operate Lord CAMPBELL expressed his general approval of the measure. The order for the second reading was then discharged. The County Couri Judges (Falconer and Yates's Sales) Bill was read a second time. COURT OE SESSION (SCOTLAND) BILLT Trhe LORD CHANCELLOR moved the second reading of this Bill, the object of whioh was to enable a more eqeal distribution of business to be made between the two branches of the court. One of the courts was, he understood, more popular than the other, and was overladen with business, so that at the end of the year there had been left an arrear of 280 causes. Lord CAMPBELL said that though he had presented two petitions against the Bill he gave his support to it. Lord PANMURE gave a reluctant assent to the measure. and wished that its operation had been limited in point of time. The BiU was read a secor.d time. CRARITABLE TRUSTS ACTS CONTINUANCE BILL. On the motion of the LoRD CiANoCE Loon this Bill was read a second time. The Reformatory Schools Bill, the Industrial Schools Bill, the Parocbial Schoolmasters (Scotland) Bill, and the Land-tax Commissioners' Names Bill were severaUy read a third time and passed. The Canada and New Brunswick Boundaries Bill went through commilttee. The Commons' amendments to the Oxford University Bill were considered and agreed to. The Reformatory Schools-(Scotland)pBiU and the Burial. grounds (Scotland) Act (1855) Amendment Bill were reatd a second time. SUPERANNUATION ACT AMENDMNTr BILL. Lord MONTEAGLE, in rising to move the second readiag of this Bill, lamented that a measure of such importance, affecting a large body- of the civil servants of this country, should excite so little attention and be able to command so small an attendance. LT'here were not 12 peers present in the House.j In sketching the histoy of this question the noble lord said it was a, rnistake tosuppeof that a systeim of superannuation allowance conoemned,onlyAar civil servants. Sach a Aystem, in fact, was aP ,iq 3wu for the in- terests of the Stae as for. those of the seranuts of the State, b ec^tR t it the Stae,beaus i ter was ro choice between continuing in ofice men who were worn oUt and incapable ad. condeum lag them by dismissal to end theIr days peraps in phenury and suffering, this painful altrnativ was frequenty not adoeetd when men were really no longer ble to harge thei dutes flicWnt and the publio servioe ao rdigi anfleed. t wa i{810.12 that Some ARPrOach Wm3amade towads an adequate and legal proviiaon for the supa Unuation of our clvil servant& e then changes iha poerensmde tofwhih he would not refer, but they had been O frequent nde inconeistent that the systm was felt to be utterlY wanting in stabiliy A,deduction waa made from the alaries of the civit oerva tb o or thep arpoe, A4 the oric Eilntentior wah ef providing a find or the paY. rnent of their Iuperannuation m A. fund, howver, in the proper sense oftheword, was not provided; buTh by reason of tho sums deducted, wbich amiounted to Ier° cent, on the smaller and per cant,. on the larger salaries there wa* publi saving effected to be set against the superaination aowanes given This arrengement, however, was fualioc inconsistenoy. In diferent departments, and even in thb ame offies, differnet practies prevaied. There were two classes of offcoers-those appointed before and thosu appointed after 1829. In the one cam taey wear subjeted to considerable reductions from thei incomees in return for which they were entritled to rerongthe allow ances; while the retiring allowances of perons not subject to reductions wore actually higher than those of civil serants who had contributed to the fund. The result waa a great deal of discontent. The system was on all hinds admitted. to be indefensible, and awcordingly the present ChAncellor of the Exchequer introduced a Bil on the sub," ject. That meaure differed easentialy from the one before the House, but si it furnished an admission on the part of the Government that the present stem stood in need ot reform. The Bill of the Chnoellor of the Exchequer, how, ever, was not received with much favour, and was referred to a select oommittee. That oommittee came to a very ira; portant resolution-namely, that the deductions made from the salaries of tbe eivil srvants should absolutely cease, But to that resolution an addendum was made, by a ma, Jority of one, requing the Treasury to undertake the revision of the salaries of the cvil servants. In November1 1856, a Royal commission, admirably selected, was apo pointed to consider the subject, and in May of the present year this commision reported that, after full consideration, they had oome to the conclusion that, for the sake of the public service, as well as for the Lnterest of the parties conx cerned, it was absolutely necesa that the system of de. duction from the salaries of the civil servants should cease. Her Majesty's Government were asked early in the session whether they intended to introdoue any measure founded upon the report of the commisiones, and the answer was such as to ilnduce the belief that they would do so. They) however, took no step whatever in the matter, and It was only towards the close of the sesdon that a noble friend of his, a private member of the other House, introduced thii Bil Wwhich consisted merely of one clase, and was founded on that part of the report of the oommisioners hereby the abolition of the system of making deductions from the salaries of the civil servants to form a superannuation fund wak recommended. le hoped that in a future session a Bi would be introduced for the purpose of giving effect to the other recommeudations of the commissioners. He did not dguise from their lordships or himself the fact that tbe Bill would cause a very large addition to the public burdens, but he quite concurred with the commissioners in thinking that additional burden would be more than compensated by the improved conduct of the civi servants. The noble lord ooncluded by moving that the Bil be read a. second time. Lord BELPER hiving been one of the commissoners who Inquired into this subject was desirous of stating that when they entered upon their inquiry their minds were entirely free from biss, and the unammous oonclusion to which they came was founded, not upon any wish to further the private interests of the members of the civil service (with whom the Government had distinctly kept faith, for they were informed of the conditions upon which they entered the service), bnt solely and entirely to promote the public good. He could not help regretting that this measure was not introduced by Her Majests Government. The commi6sioners were re9Vested last year to report in time for legislation on the subject during the present session, and their unanimous report was presented at a period which gave ample opportunity to the Government to propose a Bill this session. He should be the last person to complaia of Her Majesty's Govermment for arriving at a conclusion adverse to that at which the commissoners had arrived. It was undoubtedly the duty of the Govrnment to consider th3 subject and to take their own view of it, but it was egually manifest that they ought to have su.bmitted that view to Parliament. He regretted that it should hAvebeen left to an independent member to bring forward a measure of his own for the purpose of carrying into effect one of the reconmendations of the commissioners, and that when that measure was so brought forward it should have been opp&ed by the Government, while they wholly omitted to say what were their views, or whether they intended to propose any measume to effectuate the recommendations of the oommissioners, He said this, not so much with regard to the past as to the present, for he thought it was of importanco that the executive Government should, if they approved those recommendations, introduce a Bill with respect to them Th$s Bill dealt with only one of the recommendations of the commissioners, and he took tha opportunity of expressng his earnest hope that the other measures which ha been suggested by them would receive the oonsideration of Her Majesty' Government during the en uing recess. Some of those mggeations the Government might perhaps be able to carry into effect of their own authority, but others might' require the sanction of Parliament. It was of the utmost importance not only to the civil servants, but to the civil service itself, that all the absurd discrencies in the present most objectionahie system should he put an end to, and he hoped that Htr Majests Government would not Imitate the neg Oe *f prvious Governments on this subject. That .eect he believed, hadoccasioned the greater p art ofthe difficulty connected. withtVissubie:t an htdlult r ul nt z overcome exoep uysomeemporary t. cI i. gtie brole' hoped that Her !ajesty's Governmient would not fail to take the recommendations of the omninissioners into condderation, with the view ofinltroducing next session, on their own responsibiiity such a measure as they conceived wou;d lead to results satisfacry to the civil servants and prom. tive of the public interests The BiU was then read a second time. Their lordships adjourned at five minutes to 8 o'clock.
HOUSE OF COMMONS, THUSDAY, AUG. 6. The SPnsxx took the chair at 12 o'clock. NEW ZEALAND LOAN GUARANTEE BILL. The order of the day for resuming the adjourned debate on the second reading of this Bill was then read. The debate wasadjourned from the 30th ult., when Sir J. Trelawny moved as an amendment that the Bil be read a second time on that day three months. Mr. HEN L13Y said he was not disposed to vote against the second reading of this Bill, though he considered its principle very objectionable. He could rot give his aent t.> the proposal for granting 180,0001. to facilitate the purcha-e of lands from the natives at a price below tha' for which it could be obtained without such grant; and unless the pro visions on that sabject were modified or expunged in com. mittee he would vote against the third reading. He di I not thik the security for the loan was altogether satisfactory, depending, as it did, upon the good faith of thi colonists. Sir J. GRAHAEM obosrved that it had been his misfortune to see the comsencoment of the proceedings connected withthis subject, to watch thom, and to resist them, bat he did not think it expedient now to revive the discussion of those proceedings. Much light had been thrown upon the transactions to which he referred in 1852, when the late Sir W. Molesworth called the attention of the HouEs to the sabject at considerable length and with great ability. The House then obtained from the Colonial-offioe detailed infor mation with respect to the occurrences that had taken place, and, although he did not think they would bear very clo"e investigation (hear, hear), he could not but regard the Ac5 of 1852 asa condonation of those transactions. He had, however, hoped that the settlement then made was final, and that the Exchequer of this country would not be liable either directly or indirectly, to any further charge in connexion with the proceedings of the New Zealand Company. He found that Mr. Merivale, who wa; examined before the committee, was pointedly aseked whether he believed that any Hlability attached to the British Treasury, and gave a somewhat equivocal answer, to the effect that he thought there was no liability under the statute, but that it was possible a liability might occur. Mr. Merivale was cross-examined on that point by the Vice-President of the Board of Trade (Mr. Lowe),whom he (Sir J. Graham) regarded with respect to colonial mat. ters, and especially upon legal points relating to the colonies. as the highest authority In that House, and it was impos. sible not to see from the questions that the Vice-President of the Board of Trade differed from the Under'Secretary for the Colonies as to the constructive liability of the Imperial Exchequer. The present question arose out of the debt due to the company from the settlers in the Middle Island, aud otherwise there would not be even the shadow of a claim upon the British Government for assistance. The amoant of the debt was 260,(001., which was charged as a mortgage upon certain lands in the Middle Island. As he understood the transaction, the New Zealand Company sought to compound the debt of 260,0005. for a prompt payment of 200,0001., to be raised by the Governmeut of New Zealand, and which probably could not be raised without the guarantee of the British Exchequer. The transaction then assumed a very extraordinary aspect. The New Zealand Government-a representative Government-would not give their consent to this composition of the debt except in coennesion with two other transactions with which the British Goveranment had nothing whatever to do-namely, tbe payment of 180,0001. to buy up what were caUednative rights, and of a further sum of 120,0001. for debts due from the northern portion of the northern island. The total debt of the New Zealand Government proposed to be advanced amounted to 500,0001., for a small portion oF which, under very doubtful circumstances, the British Exchequer was collaterally liable. It appeared to himthatthe security on which the guarantee rested ought to be narrowly pxamined. Only yesterday the Government brought in a Bill charging the Consolidated Fund oollaterally with a sum of 20,0001 to be advanced to a small port in Haddingtonshire for the improvement of the harbour. On the same evening an advance of 40,0001. was proposed to defray the cost of execating public works and msintaining educational institutions among the native tribes in South Africa and the right hon. Secretary f.r the Colonies (KEr. Labouchere) plainly inti. mated that the Government might possibly propose a similar voternext year. EHe (S3ir J. Graham) mus' say, as be. tween los and grants to the colonies, that begroatlypreo ferred gnts to loans upon collateral and contingent securitie He thought the relations between the mother country and the colonies could not be placed Upon a rnore Insecure basis than that of creditor and debtor, (Hear hear.) Whatever aid was afforded to the colonies Fhould, in his opinion, be in: the nature of a grant, the reasons for which might be asigned, sifted, and debated in that HoULs He rearded these dormaut secArities as dsngerous, and he thought the motto on the entablature of the Colonial, Minis ter's officil resdence in Downipg street should be this.- " llo lender be, "For loan oft loses both itself and friend." (" Hear," and a lhugh.) He (Sir J. Grahba) could not ay that he wazs a great admirer of the constitution of New Zealand. That constitltion was federal, including na pro. vinces, end the effect of a heavy debt might be to render it the interest of the Federal Governument to repudiate such debt. It appeared from questions put to the witness before the committee by the Vice-Preaident of the Board of Trade that the cullection of the colonial Custom' duties was entirely in the hands of the Centar Government and consequently, if the Central Govermnant should thin; it inexpedient to continne high Customs duties-a measure which would diminiah the ecurity for the debt-although thev could not reduce those duties without the consent of the no'tie Government, they night, unless the reduction of the duties was amsented to, be brought into collison with the Government of the mother country. It appeared that the Representative Chamber of New Zealndhadnot approved by a unanimnous vote the course now proposed by Her Majesty's Government. His objections to this measure were strong and deepseated. He -wss sorry to see these collateral chaes upon the consolidated fand multiplying so rapidly. He thought that such transactions with respect to the colonies were only justified by extreme necessity, and he would much rather vote for grants from time to time to meet any cases I of proved necessity than for such loans as that which the House was now asked to zanotion. If, however, notwithstankdig the growing changes bcoth atihome and abtroad, and these financial questions which wrere daily increasing in dilficrulty and importance, the Government persevered in presing measures of this nature upon the Hfouse, he could onlt say that upon them would rest the responsibility of The CHANCELLOR. of the EXCHEQUER fully admitted tbat no class of questions occadoned bim-as charged with the responsibility of the fin.nce department-so much embarrassment as those relating to the essistanoe by guarntee or by loan of colonial Governments. The old view of colonies was thav, if they did not furnish revenue or tribute, at all events they were to be economical and advantageousto the mother country. They were placed under commercial restrictions, and their trade was regulated in Such * manner as to create en imagined advantage for the mother country. They were, indeed, sacrificed commercially and financilly to the moother country. That view had, however, been entirely inverted, and the colonies were nowa llowedthe utmost freedom withregard totrade, cornmerce, and navigation. At the same time our ancient policy wnth respect to the finances of the colonies had been reversed. Instead of the colonies being tributaries of the mother country, the mother country was now tributary to the colonies; and if a financial balance were struck between this country and her colonies, without regard to the commercl advantages which we undoubtedly derived from them, it would, he beloved, be very heavily against the rmother country and in favour of the colonies. He auprehanded that the theory of Parliament was, that by seonrin. free trade with our colonies. by preventing them from nuersuin the policy of independent nations by excluding Eng lsh manufactures or establishing high prohibitory duties *n immense commerce vith distant regions was insured to this ooantry. In that manner the trade and productions of Great Britain -were benefited; and, iu order to insure the prosperity and good government of her colonies, financial advantages were afforded them-especlally when they were young or in difficulties-at the expense of the mother country. It was upon that principle that he judged the plan [now under consideration. He freely admitted that there were strong objections to imposing upon the consolidated fund a guarantee for a colonial loan of 60,0001., but he asked the House to consider the position of this question. By an Act of the 10th and 11th of Victoria it was provided that if the New Zealand Company closed their proceedings within a limited period their debt to the Crown should be remitted, and a sum of 26S,OOO should be chared upon the lands of the colony. The company fulfilled the condition, and they were thereby relieved from the debt due to the Crown, while the colony became indebted to them in the sum of 268,0001. He thought it was unneoessary to reopen any inquiry into the merits of that settlement. (Hear, hear.) He took as a fact the settlement deliberately sanctioned by Parliament, and that was the state of affairs when the noble member for the city of Loodon (Lcrd J. Russell) held the seals of the Colonial.office The noble lord saw the difficulty occasioned by this debt of 268,0001. due from the colony to the oompany, and proposed that the Imperial Government should offer to guarntee loans to the extent of 200,000L The company, he believed, were willing to accede to the arrangement, and the proposition was submitted to the colonists, who rejected It on the ground that it would not effect a complete settlement of the difficulty, inasmuch as further embarrassment had beea caused bythe treaty of Waitangi, which sanctioned the principle that the land of a portion of New Zealand did not belong to the British Crown, but was vested in the native tribes. The consequence was, that as population and industry increased, the colonists were unable to obtain land without a purchase by the Govermment. This state of things was attributable to the legislation of the mother country, and there could be no doubt that the progress of the colony would be materially promoted by the extinction of the native rights. With that object, in addition to the guantee of 200,0001., the colony asked for a further guarantee of 180,0001.; nd there were again otber liabilities, amounting to about 120,000., which It was desirable that the oolony should have the means of meeting. The-total mum for which a guarantee was sked amounted, therefore, to 500,0001. It must be borne in mind thrt the Kahilitiei a 6he .oly wasor, If-4. o i P}v, to Imperiallegation and control, but he felt that the coloniasj hd nolega claim whateveruponParliament. (Hear.) Thi was merely an appeal to thegenerosity and liberality of the House, and if they thought fit to reject the Bill, there would not be the smallest reason for complaint on the part of the colonists. (Hear.) He would remind the House that the colony of New Zealand was in its infancy; it was in a temperate climate, where Englishmen could labour in the open air; its soil was fruitfal; and there was a fair prospect that, if the colonial Government acted wlth good faith, they would be able to pay the interest of the loan and to provide a small sinking fend annally for the extinction of the debt. The right on baronet (Sir J. Graham) seemed to think it a disadvantage that the colonial customs duties which constituted the main securty for the loan, were collected by the central Government and not by the provincil Governments. Now, on the contrary, he (the Chancellor of the Exchequer) deemed that arrangement, an advantag. If there were any probability that the central Government would be subvrted, and that the provincial Governments would obtain the control of taxation and of the appliecAtioa of the revenue, he might entertain some apprehension as to the socurity for the loan; but so long as the central Government was maintained, he believed that, unless some unforeseen reveTses or calamities should occur-a reasonable etpectation might be entertained that due provision would be made for the payment of intercst, and for the provision of asinking fund. He hoped, therefore, the House would asent to the second reading of the Bill. Mr. ADDERLEY thought that, as a fair opportunityvwas now afforded of getting rid of thin debt by a composition upon very favourable terms, it was quite as much the interest of this country as of the colony of New Zealand to close with the offer. The debt had been created under the pHoXy of tbe Imperial Parliament, and the colonis> migBLt herefore imstly claim the assstnc of the mother cotLntry for its liqtidation. With regard to the question whether or not the security was satisfactory, be might observe that the proposed loan amounted to 500,0001., which was expected to be raised at 4 per coent., with 2 per cant. for a shiking fund, and the colonial revenues upon which this debt would be secured amounted at present to 180,0001. a-year. From the rapid progress made by the colony within the last four years he thought there could be no doubt as to the sufficiency of the security. It was quite absurd, in his opinion, to suppose that the colony would make any attempt to escape the burden of the loan, and to throw it upon the Imperial Parliament. Mr. AIRD thought it was perfectly clear that even if the House should refuse to guarantee this loan the colony of New Zealand would not be much embarrasscd, for with a revenue of 180,0001 a -year the colony could have no great difficulty in borrowing500,0001. He understood from the Chancellor of the Exchequer that one principal reason for proposig the Bill, was that unless this country guaranteed the loan the colony of New Zealand would have to pay a much higher rate of interest than if the guarantee was given. Now, in all new colonies the rates of profit, and consequently the rates of interest, were high, aud therefore the colonists of New Zealand could afford to pay a high rate of interest for the loan they required. When he looked to the probable demands upon the Exchequer of this country, and to the state of publio affairs, he thought the House ought fully to consider the obligations they might be called upon to meet before they consented to afford guarantees forI , 'oih it wa3S evident no great neocssity existed. REl wrould, therefore, vote against the second reading of the BilL. | Sir H. WILLOUGHBY observed that the right hon. member for Carlisle (Sir S. Graham) had said that the rosponaibility of this measure would rest with the Government, but the Government had in a most straightforward manner brought the question before the House, who, as it seemed to him, must aecept the responsibility of dealing with the subject. (gear, hear,) He thought that if there was any pecuniary claim on the part of the New Zealand Company it should be treated directly and separately, and that the Imperial Government shoald enter into a distinct arrangement wsth the colonial authorities, It appeared to him, however, that the measure belore the House would only lay the foundation of a financial squall in the colony. (A laugh.) He must say he thought it hardly fair oa the part of the Government to bring forward a Bill of this natere, involving pecuniary demands to a large amount, at so late a period of the session. (Rlear, hoar.) Mr. W. WILLIAMAS expressed his intention to vote for the amendment. Mr. C. FORTESCUE supported the Bill, observing that the proposed loan would enable tho funds derived from the sales of lands in NeW Zealand to be applied to the encon.- ragement of immigration, to the formation of roads, and tbe construetion of publie works; and, considering the growing prosperity of the colony, there could be no doubt as to the sufficiency of the seourity. The mother country had assisted Canada by loans at a critical period in the history of that colony, and the result of the experimnent was such as to encourage the House to adopt a similar course in the case of Now Zealand. Mr. GILPIN thought that, before tbae Hnuse a'sented to grant any loan for the purchase of lands in New Zealand, a searching inquiry ought to be instituted as to the dealings of the Government Commissioners with natives with reference to the purchasee of laud. It was stated by one of the commiissoners for the extinguishment of native claims that 5,000,000 acres of land, worth 200,000M, had heen obt-ained by a payment of 5,000h, and cm the faith of ertain pro rmires which were not fulfilled, WYith regard to the gua- rantee, he objected to the Government toing oVt of ibter way to become trad.ers, whether as money lenders or in any other capacity. Either the security the oolonists were able to offer was amplo and atisfactory, In which cae they might easily obtin advanoes in the 'money-markets of the world, or the ecurity was not safe, and, if that were so, Parliament had no right to mortgage the induast of the taxpaying claes of thts country to guarntee such a loan as that proposed. He would vote for the amendment. Lord A. CHURCHILL sad that from a short readenoe in the colony of New Zealand he could bear testimony to its rapid growth and prosperity, and he firmly believed it would be well able to liquidate the proposed len. The purchase of land from the natives, to far from being a disadvantage to them, was a private benefit, and the natives generally were vary anxious to dispose of their l ads, whicb, on ooming into the hands of the settlerg were brought into cultivation, and afforded the means of employment and trade to the native population. The noble lord read a statement which he had received from Mr. Kennedy, the m:nager of a bhnk in New Zealand, showing that a large number of vessels owned by natives were engaed in the transport of wheat, cattle, sheep, and agricultur pro. duos between the various ports of the islands. He womul give the Bill his cordial support. Colonel SYKES observed that the Government of New Zealand, being burdened with debt, found that borrowing money on its own security it would have to pay 8 per cent., which would lead to an annual expenditure of 40,0001, while with the guarntee of the Luperil Government it could obtain the amount required at 4 per cent., or at an expense of 20,0OOO per annum. The question wa, then, whether it was ths duty of the Imperial Government to render its assistance under such circumstances to a risng colony, and ~o prevent an unneceesa and eless exhaution of the colonil resources He held that such was the daty of the Government, and as they asummd the respnibilityvo the measure, and deemed that the secdte were satfactory, he would vote with them. Mr. DUNLOP opposed the BiLl The House then divided, when the numbers were,- For the second reading . . 87 Against It . . ., .. , 23 Majoy ... .. ....-55 The Bill was accordingly read a secoond time. SALE OF WASTE LANDS (TEW ZEALA?D) BIILL Mr. J. A. SMlITH moved the second reading of this Bill, the object of which was, he said, simply to enable the New Zealand Company to accept the sum of 200,0004 (part of the b00,000L tranted under the lat Bill) in lien of their claim of 268.0004 The hon. gentleman was proceeding to reply to EOme statements affecting the New oealand omp;ny which had been made during a previous debate, when Sir J.1 TRELA.WNY rose and asked the Speaker whether the hon. member was in order. The SPEAKER said that it was irregular to refer to proceedings in a previous debate during the preset sesion. In reply to Sir H. WrLououns, The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER stated that an advanoe of 260,000D made to the New Zealand Company bad been remitted under the authority of the 10th and l1tf of Victoria, chap. 112. The Bill was then read a second time, NEW ZEALAND GOVERNIMET ACT AMEND. KENT BILL. The order of the day for going into oDmmittee on this BiU having been read, on the question that the speaker leave the chair, Mr. LABOUCHERE said that the BE oontained some clauses whLich incidentally referred to the Bills that had just been read a second time, bat i4s main object was to carv into effect resolutions whichbhad been passed by tbe Legislature of New Zealand, and to give to the central legisltive aulthorities of that colony the powrer, with the consent of the CrowFn, of rendering (as weunderatoed) the second chambers elective. The House went into committee on the Bil, On clause 1, Sir J. TRELAWNY complained of the mannerinwhIch the natives were indoumd to part with land at low prioe and upon the faith of promises which were violate. He was informaed, on the axthority of a gentleman who had been empoyed by the Government, that within his knowledge 1,900,000 acres of land, the greater portion of it worth lOs.an cre,hadbeenobtinedfor3d.an acre, the natives aving been induced to sll the lnd on promiaes that schoois and hospitals should be built and that they should receive ether advantages, while those promises had never been fulfilled. He maintained that it wras the duty of the Uovernment to protect the interests of the natives. Mr. LABOTCHEBE felt the importance of acting with strict honour and good faith towards the native tribes. Whatever opinions might be entertained with regard to the treaty of Waitangl, its provifSlns, whether wise or lnawise, ought to he strict!T and faithfully obnerved. After careful inquiry he was satisfied, from the testimony of persons In New Zealand, ecclesiastical and lay, who had distinguished themselves by their scrunpulous regard for the welfare of the native population, that the extinction of tribal rights was mostdeairable not onlyfor the interests of thecommunity at large, but especially for those of the native tribes themselvef. The clause was agreed to, as were the remaining claus of INSUTRACE COMPANIES BILTL The House then went into committee on this BilL Clauses 1 to 5 inclusive were agreed to. On clause 6, Mhr. H B. SHERTDAN moved an amendment, with the view of extending the operation of the Bill to all insurance companies. In its present form the clause would not apply to companies which were in existence prior to the passing of the 7th and 8th of Yictoria. He complained that the application of the Bill should be limited to nie companies whilq the older companies-involvin An 3iefntWely larger amount of property, and whose solvency It was more important to ascertain-were exempted from its operation. As population, wealth, and education increased insurance companies would extend; but the effect of this Bill would be to fetter the actlon of the younger companies, and to check enterprise in a direction in which it was most desizable that it should receive encouragement. Mr. WILSON observed that the Bill consisted of two p the first, referring to the constitution of companies, being optional; and the second, enacting that perfect publicity should be given to the wole of the transactions, being compulsory. The securityfor which the hon. gentleman was anxious was provided by the latter part of the measure, which as compulsory upon all companies, whether they wrere established before or since 1844. Mr. F. SCOTT complained that a questlon of so much importance was brought forward at such an advanced period of the session. Two Bills relating to the same subject had been previonsly introduced, and this Bill, No. 3,was not delivered to m6embers until yesterday afternoon. It was therefore Imposible that the insuranoe companies throughout the country could be acquainted 'with its provisions, There was no doubt that since 1844 a spirit of speculation bad sprung up with reference to these companies, and' number of offices called insurance-offlices had been established, which were, in fact, very little better than betting offices (Hear, hear.) He was not oposed to leglation on thi8 subjecOt ut he thought such legisation ought not to be crude and hasty, but sound and well considered. He certainly did not see wrhy the sarae principle which was applied to the younger offices should not be extended to the older companies, The clause 'ass agr6eed to. | }r. F. SCO1T then moved that the Chairman report progress. After some conversation the motion was agreed to, and the House resumed. The Summary Proceedings before Justices of the Peace Bill, the Metropolitan Police Stations, &c, Bill, the Boundaries of BrghsExtension (Scotland) Bill, and the RepresentativePeers (Ireland) Billwere read a thid time and passed. The sitting of the House was suspended shortly before 4 o'clock. The House resumed at 6 o'clock. PETITIONS. Petitions against the Divorce Bill were presented by Mr. PACxs, from Kibworth, In the county of Leicester - by Mr WmTosisu, from the clergy and parishioners of 1lymhill and Weston-under-Lizard, in the county of Stafford, and from the clergy within the rural deanery of Pontesbury in the county of Salop; by tr. SvMrnoPi, from the inhabitants of Grayingham, in the county of Lincoln, against the remarriage of the guilty parties; and by Mr. Punnxsi, from the gnardians of the Bnntingford UJnion, in favour of County Finance Boards. THE INDAIN BBUDGET. Mr. DUNLOP (for Mr. CEEETTHAM) asked the President of the Board of Control on what day he intended to bring forward the Indian Budget. Mr. V. SMITH said he did not think it advisable to name a day until the urgent business now before the House had been gone through. CLOTHING FOR THE TROOPS IN INDIA. Sir H. WILLOUGHBY asked the Under-Secretary for War whether the troops that had been sent to India had been provided with clothing suitable to the heat of the cli- mate to which they would be exposed; and, if so, if he had any objection to state what provision had been made on that subject. Sir J. RAMSDEN said the most gatisfactory way in which he could answer the question would be by reading, with the peraission of the House, the list of articles issued to the troops on their arrival in India, in addition to the ordinary supply of necessaries which they had in this ooun. try. They were as follows.-For the cavalry, four white jackets each, six pairs of white overalls, two pairs of Set. trirgee overalls, six shirts, four pairs of cotton socks, and one pair of white braces. For foot soldiers, four white jackets, one pair of English summer tronsers, five pairs of white trousers, five white shirts, two check shirts, and one pair of white braces. Those articles were not supplied in this conntry, but formed a part of the soldiers' necessaries on his arrival in India, and were made of material made on the spot and best suited to the climate. Daring his stay in India, China, Ceylon, and at other hot stations he was provided with a tunic and sheD jacket in alternate years, and in the year in which the tunic was not issued the difference in the value of the two artioles was paid to the soldier, to be expended, under the authority of the officer oommanding, for his benefit in any articles guited to the climate of the station. In addition to these the troops now going out to China and India had been provided with white cotton helmet and forage cap covers In fact, the Government had taken every precaution to msintain the health and comfort of the tooops Colonel NORTH asked whether the army in the field before Delhi were wearing the tunic, and also whether all those extr aices referred tio by th be arried by the troops.

THE KINGSTOWN RAILWAY. Mr. G. HAILTON, on the pert of Colonel Taylor, asked the Vioe-President of the Board of Trade whether. he had received an answer from the directors of the Kingstown. Railway, explnining their non:compliance with the law; and, if so,whetherhe would communicate such answer to theHouse? Mr. LOWE said an answer had been reoeved that morn,ing. It was on the whole satisfactory, but as the eorrespondence was still going on he did not think it vrould bet proper to lay it on the table of the Houe. DIVORCE AND ATRI.MONIAL OAUSPs BILL. The House then went into committee on this Bill, reenmiDg at clause 8, which provides for the constitution of tAe. courL Mr. DRUVZIOND said he had objected to the Bill from the commeneement, but in the observations which he iade upon the second reading he confined himself stricly to that principle of the Bill, andhad been no party to two attempts. to throw obstructions in the way of what he oonsideredto, be the decided opinion of the Houne. (Ear, bear.) On the contrary, he wished to oontribate whatever part he eouldi to.nakstheBill,notuch as he fancied the Bill should be, but such as itvasdeclared the Bill ought tohe betU he6 who origin`lly brought it forward. T_Weause befethe committee cstitusod th cour e fbouht it maiVlive struck every one, except the framers of the Billr tbMxeaeh a.

It oocurred to hmg that if there were only one judge in all the other courts this courtmight be presided over by one judge, for, In point oat tat, the House of Lords w really nothing more than the. machinery by which the Lord Chancellor pronounced JLdg ment in these cases. He therefore proposed to substitate one judge for all these judges and the only way ho eould di it, according to the forms of House, was to move to leve out clauses 8, 9, and 10, for the purpose-of substituting other: clauses, which hie could not move unil the end oS the Bill. The clauses which he should propose at the end di th Bilip were- " The judge of the Court of Probate shall be also judgd of' the Court o Matrimonial Causes and Divorce, and shs, i have fall authority to hear and determine all matiers addg therein. " Suitors who are diatisfied with the decisions of theCourt of Mlatrimonial Causes and Divoroe in suite which. have come before it in the first instance may appeal to the Judicial Committee of Privy Council- but suitors who have, a plied to the County Courts can oniy appe to the Court. of Matrionil Causes and Divorce.' His object wea to reserve cases involving a great amount oyF property for the ne iourrt, but to give to the poorer clatsesthe power of instituting the same suits in the County Cxirts, which was the only possible way of providing a cheap court. Ho should aelo move the addition of the fobeowinrclauses: " The parties who under the provisions of this Act ard. entitled to seel dici separation through the County Courts In the district where they reside may giae noticv ofr their Intention to apply for the smae to the clerk of the paite court, who shall enter such notice in a book to be kept for: thatpurpose, andt tehjdge of thes ed courtdall forward a copy of such notice to the Judge Ordinary of the Court of rriage and Divorce, but no further stme shal be ta is. therein antil after the expiration of one yaear from the dago of the notice.

Perhaps the learned gentleman was prepared to state to the committee what he proposed to do. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said that when, the otherevening, his hon. and learned friend the member for Wallingford called attention to the constitution of the ourt,. and suggested that it would be better to have a largernumber of judges from which to choose in order to renadermore certain the expeditious proceeding of the court, ha thought the suggestion a very good one, sad it tadlied with idea which he h da previously ntertained. He wished, therefore, to have the clase postponed, to have an opportunity of conadering it He had since considered it very maturely with the aid of those who had given the subject much consideration when it was be. fore the House of Lords, and he thought that unlemchap ; were introduced into the Bill it would be better to adhere t the oonstitution of the court as it stood. It ceraily dii occur to him when the question was first mooted that. there might be some difficulty in getting together w court constituted of one of the Cbief Justices and of the Lord Chanoelor, in addition to the Judge of theProbate Court. The Lord Chancellor had had a partiolar converution with the Lord Chief Justioe, a d the opinion entertained--of the accuracy of which he, was porfetly utisfied-was that there would be a certainty of the court, oonstituted according to tb e Bill, meeting without inconvenience or difficulty sufficient, number of times a year for the deepatch of the bsines committed to it.

LONDON,) FBIDAY. AUGUST 7, 1857. In the House of Lords last night, After some preliminary business had been deapatched, The Marquis of SALMsITnY, on the question of the second reading of the Militia Bill, expressed a hope that every encouragement would be given to enlistment from the Militia into the Line. The Duke of RIcrMOND thought it would be very desirable if the commanding officers of Militia regiments were empowered to make an arrangement with the men whose term was expirng nome two or three monuths previous to the expiration of that term. . Lord PAb-uun said that every facility would be geven to such enlistments. The Duke of C0A3BRIDGP had heard the sentiments expressed by their Lordahips with the greatest satisfaction. No army could be complete *aie licient' in the field unless it had reserves to draw upon. The Militia at home stood in this relation to the army in India, and therefore the determination of the Government to embody the Militia if necessary had his cordial approval. The Bill was then read a second time. The Fraudulent Trustees Bill and the Trustees Relief Bill passed through committee. Lord St. LEONA)D's withdrew hia Bil for shuilifying the transfer of Real Estates. The Superannuation Act Amendment Bill was read a second time on the motion of Lord Mo=- R&ILE. Several other Bills were forwarded a stage, and their Lordships adjourned. In the House of Commons, at the early sitting, the adjourned debate on the seoond reading of the New Zealand Loan Guarantee Bill was resumed by Sir J. GRAHAM, who urged that the security on which the guarantee rested ought to be narrowly examined; that the Federal Government might have an interest in repudiating the debt, and the relations between the colony and the mother country might be thereby perilled. He preferred grants to colonies to advances uponk securities, and his objection was in other respects very strong to these collateral charges upon the Consolidated Feund. The C Cnuo of the ExcHRnz admitted tht no class of questions created so much embarrassment as the giving assistance to our colonies by guarantee or loan, and that there was a great objection to throwing this guarantee of 500,00(1. upon the Consolidated Fund; but, oonsidering that the fiancial difficulties of New Zealand had been partly produced by Imperial legislation and control, and that there was a fair and reasonable expectation that the interest and sinking fund of the loan would be paid by the colony, which would have the power to repay it, he thought that, although there was no legal claim, the HIouse would lay aWfoundation for the (itur4 prosperity of a young colonky by an exercise of libezality and generosity. Mr. ADDEHLIEY supporte the BillEon the grounds of expediency and justice and the sufficiency of the ecurity. Mr. CAIRD, looking to the probable demandc upon the Exchequer of the country, objeted to its assuming this guarantee. Sir H. WnMOUGUBY considerod it hardly fdir to inng forward questions involving pecuniary caim at that lato period of the session. The Bill was opposed likewise by Mr. W. W.- IA S, Mr. GLPIN and Mr. DUNLoP, and Was supported by Mr. 1nRTEWu, Lord A. and Colonel byjcz. Upon a division the second reading w carried by 78 to 23. 3Mr. J A. Ssum, in moving the second readi.g of the Sale of Waate Lands (New Zealand) Bill, sait the object of the Bill was to enable the New Zealand Company to accept 200,0001. in full discharge of a claim of 258,0W01., and to Xake the compromise binding upon the shareholders. After a few words from Sir J. TmAwyy the CB"c,Oa of the ExcrruEn, and Sir . WIT LOflGIa3Y, the Bill was read a second time. The New Zealand Government Act Amendment Bill went through committee. "lhe Summary Proceedings before Justices of the Peace Bill, the Metropolitan Police Stations, &c., Bill the Boundaries of Burghs Extension (Scotland). Bil, and the Representative Peers (Ireland) Bill were read a third time and passed. Inthoevening thel sewvent again intocommittee upon the Divorce and Matrimonil Causes Bill commuencing writh ths 8th clause, specifying the Judges who were to constitute the foll aourt. Mr. DRaxmsoxD moved to omit the Clause, with the view of substituting a clause enacting that the Judge of the Court of Probate should be the sole Jtudge of the Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes, with full authority to hear and determine all matters arisingthereln The ATroRnmy-G G?EA raid that, after mature consideration, he was satisfied of the propriety of adhering to the clause as it stood. Strong objections to the proposed constitution of the court were urged by Lord J. MlAsN2Rs, MIr. MaLINs, Lord J. llussExi, and Mr. HE[IbLY. Sir G. Gnzz suggested that the clause niight be Slowed to stand until tho other clauses were considered, and upon the report the House might decide upon the expedieney of any alteration in the constitution of the court. A long discussion, in which increasing importance was attached to this clause, terminated in a division in its favour. In the 9th clause, to the matters reserved for the jurisdiction of not less than thtee judges of the court were added petitions for annulling a marriage. While this clause was iunder discussion the Government were much pressed, as the existing country machinery was to be swept away, to provide some local jurisdiction, and an amendment was moved by MIr. DRU3nIOND (vhich he subsequently withdrew, as being informal), empowering the Judge Ordinary, within certain limitations, to authorize the County Courts to try cases and decree judicial separation. On arriving at the 16th clause, the Chairman was ordered to report progress. The Constables (Detached Parts of Counties) BiU was withdrawn. Sir J. BuLLus moved the second reading of the Prisoners' Removal Bill, but, Mr. MASSaY objectingI to the measure, the motion was withdrawn, and the i order for the second reading was discharged. Sir F. KELLY moved the third reading of the WiUes, &c., of British Subjects Abroad Bill, which, after a few remarks by the ATronNE-66Nxnu was agreed to, and the Bill passed. The report of the Committee of Supply was brought up and agreed to. The Sale of Obscene Books, Arc., Prevention Bill was committed pro forM&. On the order for going into committee upon the LeIa and Sales of Settled Estates Act Amendment Bill, Mr. Oox :moved to defer the comnmittee for three, months, but this nmQtiQa- was ueeatiYed.Adn tha -H-ouze went into commiittee on the Bill. Mfr. AYPTox moved that the Chairman leave the chair, and, upon a division, this motion was carried by a majority of l-45 to 44. After some further business, the House adjourned at 3 o'clock.
The ldiitia has often been described as the constitutional force of the country. It is our only reserve, and there are those who think it ought also to be part of the standing army. What is more reasonable, they ask, than that our great landowners should employ for the defence and peace of the State that natural tie which will always exist between them and the yeomanry and peasantry born and bred on their estates ? It is true we have no clanship in this part of the island, and society in these days is not anxious to see the working classes familiar with the sword or the musket. At home, and in the provinces, we do not show much as a military people. But, for all this, we are an independent, self-protecting people, and this character is abundantly recognized in the relations between the different classes. At a word the gentry supplies any number of officers, while the villages and small towns do their part in contributinig any number of fine lads ready to do a little soldiering-perhaps a good deal. Neither class has yet shown any sign of exhaustion. It is true that if a lad has a very decided 'wish to see real fighting he enlists into the Line, and not into the Militia. But there remain many others who want to see what it is, to look before they leap into the stern reality of war, and to acquire that self-confidence best given by military training. So there always wilL be recruits for a Militia, and there always will be many whom a few months' training will decide in favour of a military life. As yet there has been no decline of the natural ambition and spirit of enterprise which lead a mrn to prefer a red coat to a smock frock, and the prospect of encountering his country's foes on the other side of the globe to a life of ploughing and thrashing within the limits of his parish. Even with the immense and still increasing drain for all other employments, there are stil enough for the Army and Navy, ana there is till a wide maargin even for the Militia. In England alone, even after deducting the averago emigration, there is every year a natural increase of 200,000, a quarter of whom wiL be men. So that there must indeed be a very great consumption of men, greater than any we have yet experienced in our greatest and most unfortunate wars, before the supply can fall short of the demand. England has, then, to fall back once more on this natural and most abundant resource-the old constitutional Militia. That is, in a word, the very scene enacted last night in the Lords, when the SEcRETABY or WAR and the ComsY2mznn-ix-Cwx conferred with three of our great landowners on the best means of using the Militia for fil1ing the raniks of the regular Army. There is some little nicety required, it appea, in arranging the bounty,-no great affair, but yet, like many other trifles, giving occasion to slackness, or, worse, dishonesty. The men must not have zwo bounties at once, and, on the other hand, the Militia must not be perverted into a memas of preventing men from enlistment into the Line. These are matters for Lords-Lieutenant to settle with the War Minister and his colleagues. But we must say, if there is anything in the position of the British landowner, if our nobility have real noblenens, and our gentry have indeed gentle blood; if the numerous institutions which give social and political weight to the aristocracy of the soil are worth maintaining against t:he newer influences and rising interests of the day, then the result ought to show itself in the existence of a really patriotio Militia,1 ready to supply abundant .hampions of their country. Our Militiamen ought to have every 'reasonable arguments every honourable motive, every- necessary iiformation brought. home tk their hearts And understandings.

A French Acte 'ccztion is a document ag unlike as possible to an. English idictment. The foreign jury is presented; not with a colourles and tehnical specification of the alleged crime, but with a studiously passionate acmnulation, oi all the facts and, inferences which tend to raise a suspicion against the accused. The opening speech of the counsel for the prosecution is in England intended for a purpoe somewhat ai; iu t i ourCrinminal Uourts the advocate for ithe.-Ciow never appeals to the feelings orto the prejudices of the jury. The advantagec which ma,ay be derived from sophistry and fronm rhetorical artifice are by common consent left excluiavely to the prisoner. Continental juris argue, not without reason, that justice ought to incline Ma little on one side as on the other; but, if an undue acquittal is a subject of regret, there is something shocking in the possibility that X jury mayb3e intentionaUy misled into a conviction. The voluminous statement of the ease for the prosecution against the Italians vwho are charged writh a plot for assassinating the Emperor Louis NAPOLEoN would certainly not satisfy any English jury, although it might be borne out to the letter by the evidence ; but it is nevertheless possible that in substance it may be consistent with the truth. Insome parts there is an obvious eagerness to overstate the charge against the prisoners. Certain poniards which were seized by the, police appear to have been smeared with a greasy substance or fluid, and a chymica ana.y was very properly instituted for the purpose of detecting possible traces of 'poison. It appeared that the grease was produced from "1 some bulbous vegetable-such, for instance, as a "root of garlic-and that, although it had no "poisonous properties, it might in certain cas "produce very bad wounds." Daggers may, undoubtedly, greased or ungreased, in certain. cas "t produce very bad wounds ;" but it requires the zealous credulity of an Imperial official to blieve that an assassin in preparation for a great c4me, would half poison his weapon with the juioE of an onion. At Naples witnesses would easily have been provided to swear that the extract was of the deadliest kind; but, fortunately, Parisian justice, though fidgetty and intemperate, is incapable of subornation. The case against IiDu RoLTur depends on an ambiguous and doubtful statement by an acsomplice, who has every motive for implicating persong more important than himself. Tho acculed BAnTOLorrI states that he was taken by sne ltsAuinrr to the house of X"zzm, tol-whom ho was then introduced. " A Frenchmea- "present at this interview, who is dec.bed-by CB Ano1AOrT as being a tal, stout man, irith "mustachio3, whose name was twice mentioaed tin his presence, and which name he promuoe, "in his Italian accent, ' RoDPCONz RojLLU-Z.' i' conversation then took place in tfie presence of the Frenchman. On another occasion JWss&Urr Says that he has no money, and that he shall have none till RODROE It0OLL gives him Some. This is tie whole evidence which affects Lm)nr ,Itoizx, although his name has been Published in the Monitetu as an undoubted accomplice in asistion. There are many Frencmrenin london:witb mustachios; some of themnmay be ta and atout; any or all may be addressed by snames bearig' more or less resemblance to those of obnoxious oT04iticians. The Procureur-General has at least giveg a suffliciet aswer to the challenge for au Englis prosecution of the accused. No, police mnagiaate would remand a prisoner for half an hour on sauchl hearsay statement of an inconelusiove Ift. That M. LDzmu Rorr was A bacpatriot, n'misfevoiis ruler, a spiteful enemy of the countr rhi shelters him, possibly a mischievous oospmitoo, would be considerations wholly irrelevant to the charge of complicity in assination. A stronger case of suspicion is raised agint MAAzzr, if the documents quoted in the ActcA Accusation are genuine. The direct n d tendence of the prisoner OILL is entitled e to little consideration.

The town of Drogheda appears, so far ii the 'late election represents it, to be much in the same :atate, moral and intellectual, in which it wam at theBattle of the Boyne. It obeys now exactly the same law which it obeyed then, and no other, -viz., Dragoon law. The eAidence given before -the Election Committee represents the Battle of the 13oyne as still the great event of the day at I)rogheda, as if in the idea of priests and people there very little had taken place since. It is appealed to as a comparatively recent event, and the allusion is used to rouse popular passion. It appears to be still -considered upon the cards that that sad disaster may be retrieved-that KCing WuTA% may bebeaten in turn and King JAMES triumph. The Portuguese -still expect King Jor. to come to them again ever the sea. It will rather surprise our readers, but it is a fact, that the Battle of the Boyne is <*ill an election cry at Drogheda. It is talked of at the hustings and excites uproar. Let the 3)rogb.da Committee's evidence speak:-" The R'"ev. Mr. MONTAGUTE called upon the people "to remember that in days of yore the 4 river Boyne ran red with the blood of their <' forefathers. The mob roared, stones were "' thrown, and people were attacked in the "streets." Here, then, is a cry, and it would appear an effective one. " Father 11.Nnr,TTY said " that the Battle of the Boyne was to be fought "over again; that M'CANN was the man of GOD s' and MOOns the man of the Devil, and that their "4 enemies were preparing crowbars to break open "I the convent doom." The rest is in keeping. We 11ave committee-rooms broken into, windows sanashed everywhere, the mob spitting on all Captain Moons's voters, heads cut open, volleys of 6tones, and Protestant churches attacked, amid shouts of " Soupers," " Orange pups," &c. Father HucHEs meets a man and says, " Are you going to support that fellow against MCANN? If <you do, I will shake the dust off my feet against <' you, and that will bring you to perdition." Father 3 ONTAGuE hs wily tactics as- well as noisy -ones, "We will give the women three '"days' dispensation if they will make their '"husbands vote for M'CASK." " The dis<' pensation" is explained to mean, " that the 4w wives were for the time to wear the breeches," or, in committee-room language,. to " have pre"' dominance over their husbands." Finally, the 2nilitary are called in, and the election comea to a ,conclusion under the care of a troop of Cavalry and a company of Infantry, whose presence, however, -ails to inspire Captain MooRE's committee with -oufficient confidence, for they withdraw their candi4ate from the polL Here is a specimen of an Irish election. Mayo iz the same. In fact, when we have one disputed Irish election, we have got all. The evidence 2night be stereotyped, and then the same -would do for Mayo, for Drogheda, or any other place, without the trouble and expense of fresh witnesses. It is always priests shaking off the dust of their feet at all voters for Ahe rival candidate, saying that all who vote for their candidate vote for GOD, and all who vote for -the opposite vote for the Devil. Mix with theso gpiritua1 censures the proper quantity of brute force, stones, brickbats, smasbed . windows, and fractured doors, and yeu have an Irish election. MThe military come in as a matter of courue, - and *are as indispensable as -the poll-clerks. The genuine featurec of an English aisputed electicn, on the other hand1 arm drininAg and bribing. There is drinking, also, at Irish elections, but the English drink quietly, the Irish noisily. The process is a different one in the two countries. Irish election drinking is a sort of religious act ; it is superintended by the priest, and the object is so many broken heads of the rival party. The band of chosen champions issues forth from the alehouse, where the priest has been handing round the grog, armed awith stones and brickbats, and up to anything. Irish drinking, then, is a sort of electioneering sacramentunin; it excites, a sacred fury, it is attended with a sacerdotal blessing, and it consecrates the faithful champions to the religious act of putting hors de combat so. many of the profane-the enemies of. GOD, of the PoPr, and Fathers HUGHES anrd H1AxuATrY. It is a COsELIz frenzy, of wbich whisky is a happy accident. In England drinldng is not a religious act. We are not an imaginative people, and we attend to one thing at a time. Religion is one thing, drinking is another. Electioneering drinking in England does not profess any high, and still less any sacred, aim. An Englishman does not profess to have a public object in drinking; he does not even pretend to drink for the benefit of his wife and family. Hle simply " soaks"-a quiet process, unaccompanied by inspiration of any kind, and leading to no breaches of the peace. A bad voter takes his drink and votes for his man. This is not sacred frenzy, but it is, at any rate, a mode of drinldkg which is more convenient to the public, and leads to less Boldiers' and surgeons' expenses, to fewer broken bones, amputated legs and arms, and healed fiactures of the skvdl. This is the great difference between bad English and bad Irish elections, the Kidderminster riots being the only exception to the general fresdom from violence which characterized the English generalelection in the spring. The sin of theEnglish voter is peaceful corruption ; of the Irish, party rage and barbarity. The former pockets his pay witb quiet selfishness, and the other breaks his opponent's head with furious disinterestedness. It is difficult to say which is the more or which is the less hopeful case individually. They would be both very awkward persons to argue out of their offences. The corrupt Englishman says that his vote is his own; that he has a right to get what he can for it; that he does nobody any harm by voting for one man more than for another. The riotous Irish voter says that he breaks arms and legs for the honour of GOD and the furtherance of true religion. Both, therefore, think themselves quite in the right. The Irishman would, perhaps, in the dispute be the more obstinate, because he not only thinks himself in the right, but thinks himself a hero and a saint into the bar gain. While the Englishman would justify his selfishness, the Irishman would boast of his zeal: but, though individually the two offenders may be very much on a par, the Englishman is much less of a public nuisance than the Irishman. These electioneering petitions, and the evidence accompanying them, are to the public what the stings of conscience are to the individual-they remind us that we are not, after al, too enlighteaed and too civilized a people. They bring us b tck from our dreams, and show us what we are-the vulgar fact. It is mortifying to have to loolk at ourselves in so very unfavourable an aspect, but it does us good. Here is, a quarter of a century after the Reform Bill, low soaking corruption in England, and, after ten years of comparative ordeL and tranquillity, here are priests' and shillelagb rows in Ireland. Have we only scotched tht Irish snake, and not Idlled it ? It might seem w& at firb, night, buX on nooon4- tho-gMit we ten years' social progress above these electioneering rows as evidence. Let us hope that these latter are only relics of an old spirit coming up to th` surface again in a tite of excitement, but substantially subdued. It would be lamentable to think that we had all the battle to fight over again in Ireland. But, with Father HArNHATTs leave, we do not think that is the case.

SECO-LND EDITION7 THEB TIMBS-oiFrFI, Friday Momning. EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris corzespondent, dated yesterday (Thursday), 6 p.w. The trial of the Italians alad Otheis on the charge of conspi rzIIg against the life of the Emperor of the French opl-ied to-day at the Assize Court of Paris. Four of the accused, being out of the French territory, are proceeded against by default, and, in care of continued absence, will be judged by the Coult without the jury. The Judges took their seats at 10 o'clock, aod, on the demand of the Procureur-General, a 13th juror was named, in order te take.tbe place, if necessary, of one of the 12. Notwithstanding the interest attached to the proceedings, the Court but slowly filled with spectators. The heat of the weather probably had sometbing to do with the matter. The witnesses in the case are 11 in number, six for the prosecution and five for the defence. ThepiQtes de ontiction were displayed on a table before the Judges. They consisted of a leather valise seized at the lodgings of Tibaldi, one of the prisoners, five poniards in red leather sheaths, 14 pocket pistols with double barrels, a horse pistol (double barrel), a forimidable -lobkiug revoWer, T o bullet moulds, and two boxes of percussion cap's. The pistols were- loaded. iAt a quarter-past 3 the prisoners were brought into court, namely, Paolo Tiba'di, Grilli alias Faro, and Baiwolotti. Tibaldi appears to be about 30 years of age. He had a blouse over his clothes, and wore moustaches. So much as could be seen of his dress was black. GriUi looked about two or three years younger; he wore thick -moustaches, and was dressed like a working mechanic. Bartolotti has marked Italian features. He wore moustaches anrd a thick beard, and was also dressed in black. the two last-named speak with difficulty a few words of Prench; their bearing., seemed rather confident than otherwise. Bartolotti was more subdued, and his replies to the questions put to him were given in a low and weak voice. The examination was conducted throagh an interpreter. After the usual formalities, the acte d'accusation, or indcltment, together with various letters appended as documentary evidence, was read by the clerk of the court The concluding passage was to this effect:- " Wherefore, Paolo Tibaldi, Giuseppe Bartolotti, GrilI cdias Faro, Giuseppe Mazzin, Alexandre AuS.?te Ledru-Bollin, Gaetano Masareate, and Frederico COampdnella, the last foar not appearing, a charged -with has,ng, in 1857, in virtue of a resolution concerted and decided between them, formed a 'plot having for object au attempt on the life of t-e Emperor, the said plot having been followed by an ast committed or commenced with a view to prepare ite execution, a crime providod for by the 89th article of the Penal Code." The interrogatoire or examination of the accused and witnesses then commenced. Tibaldi was first examined. He denied all comnplicity,but owned to his acquaintanceship with GriUi and Bartolotti. He denied ever having had any rc laeions with MzainL Grilli was next interrogated. He declared that Massarenti took him to see Mazzini at London; that Massarenti asked him whether he was willing to assassinate the Emperor; he replied hewould think the matter over. He finaIy agr.ed. Mazzini put the same question to him, and gave him instructions to watch the Emperor's movements. He was ugiven 50 napoleons by faswarent; who received t4'money frann Iaszinli- Ee-fu1rth dee'ared that.at Paris he communicated his objcAt toUbdi, who rgmO-- two daggers. Grilli also avowed that he met Bartolotti at Mazzini's. He den:ed the intention of assassinating the Emperor. He accepted the money, and made the promise to do so because he was starving. Bartolotti was next examined. He decIared that Massarenti come to see him at York. He asked him to go with him to London to see MaWuL He paid his journey. At Mazzini's he met a tsU stout Frenchman, whose name he could not pronounce. Mazzini told him that the Emperor went out every evening in a low carriage. He met Grilli the next day at Mazzini's. It was agreed they should go to Paris together. He gave them Tibaldi'r address in Paris, with a mat d'ordre. He asked Massarenti for money. He said he had none, but that Rodron Rollin would prosure som.c. Two days afterwards he received 50 napoleons in gold. Grilli also received some money. Jean Baptiste Geraux, a tailor, sentenced to four years imprisonment for belonging to a secret society, declared (as a witness) that, at the end of 1853, at London, he, at the request oE Ledru-Roldin, conveyed 500f. to a certain Beaumont. The President then read the declarations of a certain Eeltchb who came to Paris with the intention Of amsassinating the Emperor; and a report from the Prefect of Police to the effcot that Keltch and Beaumont were one and the same person. The examination of Tibaldi was theu resumed. I am informed that information has been received in official quarters from Constantinople, to the effect that the new Ministy have decided that the elections held in Moldavia on the 19th ult. should be annulled, with a view to their being held again on the 1 5th inst. It is believed that General Cortelbajac is the person who will succeed M. de Morny as Ambassador to the Court of St. Petersburg, and, In the event of the resumption of diplomatic relations between France and Naples, that Prnce Carini wil represmnt King Ferdinand at this Court. The Persian Ambassador, Feruk Khan, retarned from Brussels yesterday. The Emperor is expected at Cherbourg on the 10th, on his return to Paris. It is said that a Conference is to be held inr Paris relative to a supplementary treaty between the French and Russian Governments regalat;ng literary property. A medal lias been struck at the Mint of Paris to commemorate the inauguration of the new Louvre, which is to take place on the 14th inst. A medal is to be given after the ceremony to each member of the great bodies of the State. The Minister of War has decided that Kabylia, recently conquered, shall form a new nmilitary subdivision. I have already noticed the change in the weather in consequence of the heavy rain of yesterday morning. The afternoon, though warm, was not near so opprcssive as the day before, butthereis still a good deal of electricity in the air. From 11 to 12 o'clock last night the sky was bright with lightning, accompanied by some, drops of rain, heavy and distant,c" the firt of the thunder howIer.I At 12 the sky was oompletely enveloped in dark i cloud. The rain fell at first gently, then cased, and at last rushed down with great violence. Tn a few minutes the streets wexe swept in al directions, and the- macadamized boulevards presented a series of small lakes. The lightning flashed most vividly and incessantly, and the thunder rolled. The storm lasted till past 1 o'clock, but the rain coni tinnued some time after. At 6 yesterday morning the thermometer marked 21 5-10 centigrade (704 ]ahrenheit), at noon l9 S-10 (67i Fabrenheit), arnd at 2 o'clock 22 (711 Fahrenheit), being not less than 24 degrees of Fabrenheit lower than the preceding day. Tbis day is rather cool and agreeable,- the sky is still cloudy, and we shall probably have more rain to-night.. The oixal report addressed to the Government ou the. bt fair of 3eaneaire, by the Syadic de)h-., gated 'for the pnrpoet, contairs the following relJ "Notbingless than a dtrong principle of vitklity, derivea fr?m rerl and zeciprocal advantages, can have euablcd the fair of Beaucaire to defy the commnercil revolut ons which bave Icen produced by rapid comnmuDications. It is in fact because the buyer finds there a complete ssortment of goods, and the manufacturer is certain of procuringprerchasersforhis produoe;nevertheless it cannot bo denied that ralwtays have caused thefair of Beaucaire injury. It is certa; nthatthere are persons who no longer frequent the fair,preferring to supply tbemselves in the manufacturing towns, and their abxenco Is felt at the fair; but, however, that may be, there is stUlt a considerable amonat of business transacted, and Beancaire is yet a grat commercial centre. It is particrN'rly useful fo2 the small mrnufacturezes, who fiud there the means of disposing of their produce, and of xenewing their stock of the raw materi.l. The influx of strangers was not great until the last days of the fair, and it wa particularly the last Sunday, caUed the ' fine Sunday,' thas it'Wag overcrowded. It is on that day that Beaucaire assumes al appearance almost unique in the world. There are few towns in France that have not representatives tbere. The native population appears to have been absorbed, and it may bh said that the ancient iDnabitants of the toa n are the most difficalt to be found. Notwith. standing tbe scarcity of money commercial bW's were never more punctua'ly honoured." 'Te following private telegraphic despatch has bcen rece*ied * "MADRID, AuGUOTiT 5.

Atdatu?{la.r .- -The following letter, addressed to a near relative in England by an officer of the 9th Light Cavalry (East India service) has been communicated to me. The date is not very rccent, and several of the details contained in it have been already mentioned. NeveiWhe]ess, as everything cornected with India is at this moment full of interest, I ava.l myself of the permission given me to make use of it, as it may add, in some degree, to the inform4tion already obtaWried on what is passing in a countir to which the eyes of the world are now, and wiMll be for some time to come, directed. " My dear - , I sent you a letter by the last mnail, but from the unsettled state that the country is in I cannot think there is the least probab;lUty of its ever having reached yyou. r wiYl therefore repeat a great deal of what I then told you. We have, indeed, had a velj anxious tire of it here _.;tely in consequence of a great poition of the native army havinginutinied. The disaffection was first shown in the 19th Native Infantry at Bsrampore. The reasonithey gal e for the- conduct was, that they abjcatcd to the new csr. tridges that were served out to them, which they had been told were greascd with pig's fat, which they Hraid was preju. dicial to their caste and also against their religion; but tb; 3 reason for their mutiny is of course absurd, for they were assured by Government that they were not made un of anS tWng they could posdbly object to. However, this mutinous spirit continued to spread, and next appcared in the 34th Native Infantry ar Barrackpore. On parade one of the men attempted to cut down the adjutant and the Sargeant-raijor (who is a E1ropean). They were both wounded, and were carried off the parade ground, The man has since been hung, also one of the men who was ordered to arrest him, and who disobeyed. That part of the regiment that was present at thbs parade, consisting of seven companies, has beein disbanded. I should have told you ,bat the whole of the 19th Regi-nent has been pt r'shed in the same manner. This occurred two or three months since, but about three weeks ago three native reglments at Meernt have mutinied; also two at Umbaliah, one at A;ghur, two at Ferozepore ; also the native reginments at Lahore, Peshawr, Nowshera, Delhi, and two reglments n Onde. If the brntes had been more successfr' t the places I have mentioned I believe the whole Indfan army to a man would hAve rebelled and murdered all the Europeans in the country, who, I am sorry to say, are but few for thns large prisldency. We have only about 20 European regiment, besides the European artillery, therefore if the niggers had pannd thaeir sdeigus batter they would not have had mucl4 txoub1e in getting rid of un. A sit is, they have murdered * great many people. Fit of the 3d Light Cavals rodo over trmen o7eDtT, lt -b sr-ar i-va-*e.t; there joined them, and mnrdered evesy European they Loull find, ladies and children inclusive. I hear the Wises Fraser, daughters of Mr. Fraser, of the Company's Serioe, fell into the hands of the infuriated savages, and, after hav-ng mr-. dered the father, and committed crimes of the mo-ct diabo 1ic.l de:caption upon the g;Is, they then beheaded them and paraded their bodies about the citf the rem? nder of the day. I believe the men of one re3iment at Delhi (I think the 74th) marched their offluera a short distance out of their cantonments, and then alowed them to escape. Indeed, several officeis escaped from this qcene of butchery through the luidnesa, it is said, of their men. There were 15 women and children who took refuge in the Prlace of Delhi-Al murdered. We hear that it was the inhabitants of the city who were the perpetratois of the horrid deeds I have told yon of; but, sup. po cmg that to be true, they (the soldiers) are just as cuL pable as if they committed the deeds themselves. From Meerut also we have some sad accounts. For instance, the wife of the adjutant of the 20th Native Infantry fell into the hands of these inhuman brutes, and was afverwards burnt to death. 'Tis dreadful the reports that come to tus I have been told that lra. M'Donald, after having been treated in the same brntal manrer, was besmeared e1 over with oil and burnt to death, but I cannot believe this is true. We hear so mary things that one does not know what to believe. You will be sorry to hear that among the list of kiled I see Mr. and Mrs Dawson, of the 3d Light Cavalry, Meerut, (this is '. N Dawson's ron), but I have not heard that any eet of i;olence was offered to either of them before they were murdered. Well, now I cone to orr- part of the country. It vss discovered by the Commissioner at Lahore that the native regiments (four in number) agreed on the night of the 15th inst. to rise at a given signal, and murder all the Er-opeans in the station; therefore the Be;gade wvas pa rided, and the native portion were then and there disaianeed The 16th Native Infantry hesitated a little, but in the front of Her Msjesty's 81st Foot and two troops of horse artilUey they very wisely gave up their aras, or they would mostoertainly have been fired into. The ofDcera iuL-ahore now live together in threehouses, and tholadies are aUintwo build. iugs, and are ordered bytheBrigadier not to come out ettb-r by Right or day. The men for several nights slept at their guns, and no one ever thought of taking off his clothes, ar 4 the 81sat Queen's Regiment was under arms for nights. I heard from a brother officer at Lahore the other day. He says 15 of them sleep in one house. They remain dressed all night-pistols under pillow, and sword by bed-side. Horses saddled all night ready to jump on to In a mornent. He says four of them keep watch wbile the others lie down. The Commissioner here ascr. tained by means of a bribe that the ni¢gers had endeavonred to get up a conspiracy to murder us at a large dinuer party given at our me,ee They thought it would be a favourable opportunity, as we sbould then be unarmed and perfectly helpless, but some of our men would no' consent to it, and we therefore providentiaUyescapsd. OurBiigadier took every precaution, andhad theEuropeansreadynight and day in case tho fellows should break out. The guns, which before were nuder a native guard, were drawn up in front of the Euro. pean barracks, horses harnessed all night; officers and men not on duty lay down with their clothes on. We slept soundly in a house, and adopted the same means as I hava told you they did at Labore. Bnt, much to out re,ret, an order arrived from the Commander-in-Chief in the Punjaub, for Her Majesty's 52d egimenat, all the arVillezy, the 35th Native Infantry, and a wing of my regiment. to march to Ferzerabad, and join General Chamberlain's army there, but our Brigadier kept baek two gtms and 200 of Her Majesty's 52d, butthey have since been ordered to join the others, and wilU leave the station to-night. This will leave us with no Europeans in the 'tation (except offioers), and we shaU have the other wing of my reginent here and the 46th Regiment of Native Infanttj,, but I see no fear now. The niggers have signally failed at the other stations, aDed are in a precious funk now, and evidently wish they had never mutinied. I hope the General will punish them severely at Labore. Nothing asc than blowing them away from the gaor vill be of any use. The Lahore Chronicrc yesterday stated that the ComnAnder-in-Chief had hung, 170 men at UmbJlabh. I only hope it is true (I doubt if it is). There is an rrmy on its wayl to Delhi', with . siege train. The niggers hold possession of the plahe. I only hope they wiU remain there until our troops ooze up, and, by Jove, they will catoh it I believe the whWa plew is to be leelled with the ground I shionld have told you that the same paper that brought na the above intelligence sho stated that thE Commander-in Chief had been attacked with cholera, and died on his wcy to Delhi, 'The' editor of a nxtive paper at Peshawar bMd written j, Eeditious article i h it, ra-d was immediately seized,.Afled, aua hung in len than 12 hours after he w s take o, .

Tim RATING or Mus.-The following is the report of the select committee of the House of Commons appointed to inquire into the law and praetice with reepeet to the rating of royalties of mines, and rho wvere empowered to report their observations, together with the minutes of evidence taken before them, to the Rouse "That the committee have taken evidence on the subject referred to them from all parts of the conntry This evi dence has shown that the liability of mines to be rated to the poor and other parochiairates is foil of anomalieg,and (except in the case of coal mines) depends more on the form of areementbetween the lessor and thelessee than on any general rule of rateability. Althongh mines (other than .oal mines) are not as such rateable yet, vwhere tbe royalty or due is rescrved in kind it is held to eb ratcable, on the legal principle that the lord who receives it is an occupier of land, and as such is subject to be rated for his occupation under the statute of the 43d of Elizabeth. The reservation of royalties in kind appears from the evidence to be still the practice in Derbyshire and in some districts of Cora wal, and to have been the universal practice in Corn. wall till the year 1832. Where the royalty is reserved in the shape of a money payment, sach liability is held not to exist. Open mineral workings, quarries, nd coal mines are deemed to be rateable, and are rated in all cases. The committee is of opinion that there are no valid gro".ds for these distinctions. That so long as coal mines and open mineral workings and quasrries are asseseed toi-the different local rates, the committee see no reason why the rating should not be extended to all other mines That open mineral workings or querries and close mines should, as far as rating 1S concerned, be placed on the same footing. That evidence haz been given of peculiar customs existing in Derbyshire, and that the lord's dues, arising 1rom lead mines in that county, are taken in kind, and are assessed both to the poor and highway rates. That it has been contended with great for,e before the committee, that in the assessment of mines tbe principle should be recognized, that the working of a mine, of whatever description, is the asing up of the corpus of the estate, and not of the mere anual produce capable of reproduetion. That in making the asessment on mineral property, of whatever description, all plant and machinery, looomotive or stationary, in any way connected with or belonging to the mines, and which i incidental and necessary to the working thereof, should be asseesed as a whole, together with and AS part of the mine, and not separately.

TISIT OF THEIR MAJESTIJS TEB BM1'EBOR AND BRUBESS OF THE FRENCH. Yeaferday morning, at a much earlier hour th3n was generally anticipated by the public at large, the Emperor and Empres of the French arrived at Osborne. The visit ls beyond all doubt a strictly private one, and such precautions have been tken to insure its being kept so that literally nothing whatever is known of the intended movements of the Imperial visitors, and but for the Royal sauting Wbis morning very few would have known that they had come at al. Osborne presentsunrivaUed facili- I ties for such strict seclusion, not the nominal secualon of Emperors, but the undisturbed quiet of a private faily. The illustrious individuals, whoever they may be, arrive and step out of their yachts almost at the door of Osborne-house, departing in the aame quiet and perfectly unrestricted manner. Such a chef d'rvfoe of privacy was the visit of the Grand Duke. Constantine that to this hour a respectable minority believe he never came at aLL The same opinion cannot obtain with regard to the Emperor and Empress, though previous Rrecautions have been redoubled to keep all relating to their movements strictly secret. A most vigilant surseillance is kept up in the neighbourho 'of Osborne, and, indeed, al over the island, by a strong foce of the police speciaelly brought down from London for the purpose, isted in their labours by some members of the French police. Boats have been appointed to keep guard off the beach at Osborne, and to allow no shore or strange boat under any pretence whatever to approach it; so that, in the present instance, the Imperial visitors may congratulate themselves in having, indeed, effected a really private visit to the Queen on the ordinary cordial terms on which one family of rank may entertain another. This intention will be most rigidlv carried into effect throughout the brief period during which the illustrious guests re expected to remain. To supply the unusual number of boats required to row guard some of the launches and pmnnaces of the men of war in harbour were taken, and Master Commander G. A1e's vessel the Sprightly, cbristened on the old hicus a non lu ' principle, one of the dullest and ugliest tubs in port, was yesterday promoted to towr them to Spithead. At 6 o'clock yesterdray morning all over the house front, rich terrace gardens, and sloping woods of Osborne not a soul was visible. Soon afterwards, however, the signal tower was occupied, and a telescope kept continually pointed t3wards the fleet at Spithead, which again was in communication with the Alban steamer, posted far out to sea By and by a pony carriage came down to the landing-place, followed at long intervals by another and another, with grooms, led horses, and outriders, till the Royal cortbge in attendance was complete, At 7 o'clock the Reine Hortense was signalled as in sight, yet it made but alow progress, for it was a quarter past 8 o'clock before she had arrived within saluting distance of tbe squadron. The Queen's yacht has often gone over the same course in one quarter of the time. The fleet and town batteries saluted and the veesels manned yards at a quarter past 8 o'clock. The viind, though -very light, was in a contrary direction and not a sound or echo of the tremendous reverberation which the guns muat have created reached Osborne. The broad angry darts of flame from the huge vessels' sides could, of course, be distinctly seen, and so also the massive folds of smoke, vwhich seemed gradually to rise like mountns from the sea tillthe whole pile of masts and spars was hidden. But there was no echo, however iaint, and the whole evolution might have been a vivid painting or dissolving view for anything which sound could tell to the contrary. A few minutes before the salute was fired his Royal Highness the Prince Consort, in plain walking dress, accompanied by Prince Alfred, in the Hghland costume, came down to the landing-place. After a short time Her Majesty, accompanied by the Royal Princeses, also drove down and joined his Highness on the beach. Here the Royal party waited for some time, for the progress of the Reine Hortense was unusually slow. She is a screw, low in the water, but without any of the slim appearance which most even of our trading scrows prosent. Crowds were assembled on Ryde Pier to see her pass, and a whole fleet of yachts and pleasure boats-nearly a hundred in number--spread their -white sails, and * seemed as if about to follow her like a crowd of butterflies skimming and dancing over the glistening waters; but none really made the attempt, for the Admiralty orders had been published, and were strictly adhered to, and not any but the vessels of war on duty were allowed to approach within nearly two miles of the landing-place at Osborne. As the Reine Hortense dropped slowly down at half-speed the Imperial visitors could be distinctly seen standing on the quarter-deck, which was decorated with exquisite taste, and covered with small conical parterres of clustering flowers, Eo as to make it resemble a small summer garden rather than the deck of a steamer. The Empreas was attired in the plainest description of travelling dress, andleantupon the arm of Eis Majesty, who also wore a simple walkingcostumewithout order or decorationof anykind. Standing withtheir Miajesties were the Count and Countess Walewski, the Princess Esaling, and General the Baron Roland, Chief of the Staff. When the yacht had approached within about a mile of Osborne, Prince Albert and Prince Alfred entered the Royal barge. The men-of-war boats formed in double lines on each side of it, and the Fairy and Elfin Royal yachts steamed close outside all. This little water procesion was headed by the Royal barge, in the stern of which was a large silk banuer, embla7oned with the arnm of Her Majesty and the Prince Consort. His Royal Highnes immediately went on board the Reine Hortense, and warmly welcomed the Imperial guests. After a delay of a few moments the Prince Consort conducted the Empress down Into the Royal barge, in which the Emperor also took his seat, followed by the four members of hia suitetwe have mentioned. The Royal barge, both in going and returning from the yacht, was steered by Captain the Hon. Joseph Denwran, the Commnodore of the Victoria and Albert, and in a few minutes was at the landing-place at Osborne. The Emperor was the first to disembark, and the most cordial greetings apparently passed between him and Hler Majesty, and also between Her Majesty and the Emp.ess. The latter gave a most affectionate reception to the Princess Royal. Almost immediately after landing the Empress and Her Majesty and the Emperor and Prince Albert entered their pony carriage and drove at once to the house.f Captain the Hon. Joseph Denman entertained all the officers of the Reine Hortense and the two French war steamers which escorted her (La Corse and Pelican) at a magnificent banquet the same evening. In order to set at rest the numarous rumours which are at present current as to its being the intention of the Imperial visitors to visit the Manchester Exhibition, we can state most positively that nothing whatever in relati-on to the intended movements of the Court has been allowed to transpire as yet beyond the mere fact that, except for short excursions in the Royal yachts, neither the Emperor or Emprews are likely to quit the island. It is considered by those who have the best opportunities of obtaining correct information on these matters, that it is just probable the E5Pmperor may pay a private visit to the dockyard, arnd also to the James Baines, on Saturday morning, before her sailing with the troops for India. Beyond this and the fact that there is to be an early soiree dansante at Osborne-house on Saturday, nothing is known. There seems little doubt that the visit will terminate on Monday next. (From the Court Cfrcukr.) OSBORN,-, AUG. 6. Their Imperial Majestdesthe EmperorandEmprew of the French arrived off Osborne in the Reine Hortenae at half-past 8 o'elook this morning from Havre, and were received with a Royal salute. Her Majesty the Queen and his Royal Highness the Prince Consort, accompanied by Prince Alfred, the Princess Roya and Princess Alce, tded by Lady Churchill, the Hon. Beatrice Byng, Lord Charles Fitzroy, and Captainf Du Plat, lhad pro. ceeded to the pier. The Prince, with Prince Alfred, immediately went on board the Imperial yacht in the Queen's barge, which conveyed the Emperor and Empress, with their Royal Highness, to the Uanding-place, where the Qeen received their ajsties.ef The Royal party were then conveyed to the House a- Iir of the Queen's carriages anld four; the Q and Prince with the Emperor and Emprees occupying the first carriage.

THB DBATH OF BTSHOP BLOMFIBLD. The death of Bishop Blomfield is an event which no chronicler of the present times can leave unnoticed; and, although the day may be yet far distant when the boundary line will be finally adjtusted between the opposite clases of those who have indicriminately admired the Bishop on the one band, and have criticized him unkindly on theother, there are some few sattered materials which may be gathered together for the guidance of other who really desire to judge him impartially. He belonged to that large and, happily, increaing order of men whose character and abilitieo elevate them above the levelwhich the mere circumstances of their parentage might be supposed to have prescribed to them. Born on the 29th of May, 1786, at Bury St. Edmund's, he received his earliest education from his father, who conducted a school in that town. But it was at the grammar school of his native place, where he remained from the age of eight till he reached his 18th yeur, that he gained the rudiments of that scholarship which afterwards secured for him at Cambridge the distinctions of Third Wrangler, SeniorMedallist, and a Fellowship at Trinity College, havmg previously obtained Sir William Brown's gold medal for the Latin and the Greek Ode. Although the rapid succession of these high academical honours seemed merely to designate hima for the position of a sound and accurate clasica scholar, which hia earliest publications, indeed, fully maintained, it was to the ministry of the church of England that he soon devoted the whole vigour of his abilities, aud a wide sphere of growing usefulnesa was soon opened to him. Presented succeively by the present Marquis of Bristol, who has been spared to survive the emuinent proiUg' of his early life, and by the second Earl Spencer, to the livings of Quenning. ton and Dunton, he was after five years preferred by the former to the rectory of Chesterford, in the diocess over which he was afterwards destined for so long a period to preside. The see of London was at that time filled by Dr. Howley, who baving in 1817 appointed Mr. Elomnfield his domestic chaplain, and subsequently given him the hving of t. Botolph, Biahopagate, and the archdeaconry of Colchester, be was within a short interval elevated to the Bishoprio of Chester before he had reached the age of 38. lt was in that high office, and still more when, after another brief period of four years, he succeeded his patron Dr Howlev, in the see of London, that he displayed the full maturity of those talents which during the last quarter of a century made him the most conspicuous member of the English prelacy. As a debater in Parliament, whenever the interests of religion or the welfare of the clergy called him to share in its discussions, he was vigorous and lucid. As a preher he combined the clearest statements of doctrinal truth with the most forcible and affectionate deductions from them of practical conduct, all clothed in a simplicity of language which made him equally acceptable to the most cultivated and the most ill-edacated of his hearers; while the admirable management of a voice naturally melodious enabled him, without the least apparent effort, to command the attention of the largest congregations There was an utter and probably a studied absence of all action in his public elocution, whether in th6 Senate or the pulpit, the effects of it could only be attributable to the genuine sincerit3. of his character and to the sterling weight of the statements which he enforced. As an overlooker of the curacy of this populous diocess, he evinced the most marvellous power of despatching business, whether it referred to the minutest or the gravest questions, and he was accessible at all times to every one who submitted them to his notce. The disposal of his ample preferment was never prostituted to the objects of nepotism, nor to the bias of political opinion. And if he retained the revenues of a most richly endowed see long after more recently appointed prelates had acquiesced in the limitation of theirs, it was only that he might with all unsparing hand promote the erection of churches, the funds of schools, alnd the provision for the poorer clergy. It was this large and self-denying munificence that mainly tended to stimulate the same spirit in others, and which has stamped upon his age of the English Church, amid it all unhappy divisions, a character unknown to it in any other. Tlere are two measures, however, which bear upon them pre-eminently the impress of Bishop Blomfield's energetic mind-the systematic perseverance of his efforts to secure thle building of churches and the extension of the colonial episcopate from five to 31 sees, which originated in the a peal of his well-known letter to Archbishop Hoowley. The improved residences of the beneficed and the improved stipends of the unbenefieed clergy, the more effective examinations of candidates for the ministry, and the greater frequency of comnmunions and confirmations,-these were all evidences of a more vigorous ecclesiastical administration which he might be thought to have shared with his episcopal contemporaries. But it would not probably be difficult to prove that even theEe were attributable in no ordinary degree to the impulse of his mind, which encouraged and stimulated others in the path of their responsible duty. True it is, indeed, that the controversial spirit diffused over the later period of Bishop Blomfields life rendered more difficult the course of one who, like him, wished to think well of all without truckling to the mistaken opinions of any. But those will be the fratto make allowance forhis conduct in dealing with the difficulties which such a state of opinion created, who estimate the delicate position of a prelete who is called upon to arbihrate at a moment when party spirit runs high among the clergy. It would, however, be doing little justice to the character of so eminent a man if we were to drop the curtain over his mewory without unfolding one portion of it to delineate the consistenicy witliwhich he odorned all the relations of domestic life. The best friends of his school and college career were those of bis ripest years. With a memory accurate and retent;ve, and with an elastic cheerfulnessof disposition which the severest trials of arduous engagements ard often ill-;equited kindness never ruffled, the store of his reading and the fund of his anecdotes diffused a charm over the society of every circle which he en ered. TDe father of a numerous family, of which six sons and five daughterx are now deploring his loas, he laboured unceasingly to train them in the principles of the faith which from his heart he oved, and of which his own condrct afforded. them a constant example. We hsve heard upon an autbority which cannot be t.nestioned thea since his retirement into private life there were no sentimerts flowing more freqvently fromn his lips than those which exp-'ased the conviction of his own inadequate fulfilmnent of his public duties; while the enjoyment of his mental faculties was preserved to him nearly to the cloze of his existence, and his last act of consciousnees was an art of prayer.
AfONTY-.M4 TandOITYjjjjJI a0G3{. Thhursdy Evening. This has beea settling-day In the English funds, and the market generally has showa a tendency to recovery. Cousals for money opened at the closing price of Lat evening, and ultimately experienced &a improvement of a quarter per cent. The first traus. actions were at 90i to i; they then receded to 90 to 3, but the publie continued to make investments, and a rally occurred until there were buyers at 90. The final quotationi, were 901 to i for money and 901 for the 9th of September. Although the arrangements in coanexion with the wount were numerous, and many large loan transactions had I to be adjusted, the supply of money at 5i per cent. wz fully equal to the demand. There wsas no news of any kind, but the belief in the fall of Delhi continued to gai stegth, principaly from the str laid in the latest commercial letters upon the transactions of the native bankers, who just before the departmze of the nail were readily buying up Company's paper a- an advance of 2per cent. on the prices of the preceding day and of 7 per cent, on those current during the heaviest period of depresion. On the other hand, it is said there is no doubt that the Perians have taken advantage of the state of affairs in India to resist the surrender of Herat. Bank Stock left off at 215 to 217; Reduced, 90i to i; New Three per Cents., 90qto 9l; India Stock, 214 to 21; Induia Bonds, 23s. t4o is. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 4s discount to par. the discount-market to-day has been comparatively free from pressure, and l some exceptional cases foreign bills have been negotiated at a fraction belowv the Bank rate. In the foreign stock-market greater activity prevailed, and in some cas a sight advance has taken place. Turkish closed rather weaker and Ruaian improved fully i per cent.

The fial quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 66f. 95c. for money and 67f. 15c. for the end of the month, aholwing a fractional advanoe. The foreign exchanges exhibit general signs of improvement. , Some anxiety was caused this morning by the report of a very large failure at Newcastle. lc appears, however, to have been premature, and that the house referred to may be expected, with the friendly forbearance and co-operation of all the paries interested, to surmount the embarrassment m which it has found imelL The firm in question is that of Memsrs. Carr, Brothers, and Co. They ara connected with extensive collieries at Newscasle and in Wales, the latter of which have led to soms lock up of capital; but, although their liabilities ara very large, their asets are said to be ample, and such as, with good management cannot fail to yield a satisfactory result. The half-yearly meetings of the severl joint stock banki in London being now completed, the subjoined table has been made up exhibiting their respctive capitar andl extent of transactions, as wei as the periods at which they were severally opened. The growth of businews it demonstrates is very great, the aggregate increae in deposits as: compared with a year ago being 6,268,2061., or 14i per csnt. The London and Westminster, which was the first joint-stock bank founded in London, is still at the head of the list, not only as regards it total of deposits, but also the amount of dividend, since, althougi the London Joint-Stock Bank has distributed 224 per cent.,this was on a capital of 600,0001., while the 18 per cent, paid by the London and Westminter has been on a capital of l,000,0o01. Dung the year there has been a large augmentsdon th de epoltis held by the London and Westminster, the London Joint-Stock, the union of London, and the City Bank ; while the London and County, the Commercial, and the Bank of London show a decrease, caused in each case by reports circulated withont the slightest foundation at a tim, when the public mind had been rendered sensitiva by ;,he disclosures in connexion with the Royal British Bank, the Tipperary, and the London ani Eastern. Measures, however, were promptly takea to remedy the evil, and its consequenees are now pasing away. The London and County was Etrengthened by new directors, and the publication offlan efficient audit ; the Commercial boldly invited any kind of examination, ana pointed to the comn parative lugenen of its cash assets; and the Bank of Tiondon inndicated itself by obtaining a conviction of the persons who had conspired againt its credit:- 'Ine rago, from New York, to-day his broupbt, 45,0001. for England and 152,0001. for France. The comnercial advices on this occasion are wholly uninteresting. Some speculative Eecurities were slightly lower. Erie Railway was quoted 34*-; Reading, 74; New York Central 85; Panama, 92 and Illinois Central, 117. The advices from the Cape of Good Hope state that the men of the German Legion were settling down cheerfully on the lands allotted them, and that they Eeemed likely to become a mo3t valuable acquisition to the colony. The several villages at which they are located are situate about six miles apart, and great care has been taken to select spots well wooded and plentifully watered. At a meeting of the London and County Bank to. day the report and accounts were unanimously adopted, and a dividend was declared at the rate of 10 per cent. per annum free of income-tax. The chairman stated that the issue of the new shares, representing 100,0001., bad been suspended in consequenoo of the unfavourable state of the money. market, and until the effect of the now Bills introduced to regulate joint-stock banks could be ascertained. This bank, with others, being excepted from the action of the BiUls in question, the diractors now propose to raise the additionalcapital at a favourable opportunity. The chairman pointed oat as satisfactory proofs of the progress made that Fince the last half-year a thousand new credibt hava been opened, while the customers' balances have increased 300,0001., to which there has been a fartber addition of 200,0001. since the 30th of June. The bills discounted are also of a higher character. The directors have not found it necessary to retain so large an amount of cash in hand as formerly, but have realized an increaed profit by adding to the sums placed at call and short notice. With respect to the debt of Mr. John Sadleir, his estates in Ireland are advertised to be sold in November, and from Mr. James Sadleir's property having fetched its fair value a similar result may be expected in the present caae. The rents of these estates are received by the bank. A large income is derived from the Westminster Improvement property, and no loss will relt from that transtacion. Neither directors nor auditors nor any praom in the employ of the bank is indebted to It one sbhiig. In answer to a profrietor the chaFma stated that the pro'inaon ne or bad debts is-ample.

V. Shelley, M.P., in the chair, the report and accounts were adopted unanimously. No dividend was declared, the available balanco being carried over, to compensate for the depreciation in the Government and other securities held by the bank. The chairman observed that the elaborate nature of the report rendered it unnecessary for im to enter into any details. He congratulated the proprietors upon the general succes of the undertaking, notwithstanding the unfounded attacks made upon them. These charges were promulgated at a critical period and followed cloeely upon the general distrust shown by the public after the failure of the Royal British Bank. Absurd rumours were also cireulated respecting the heavy losses of the bank by the failures of Mewsrs. Fraughiadi, Gregory, and Glustiniani. In the first case the loss was reported tobe12,0O)l., butwa onlyl,2001., and in the other two instances there was no loss whatever. The exact total of bad debts in the two years the bank has been open is 7,8761., and the sum of 10,000,000W. has been turned over in discounts in that period. The chairman concluded by stating that the bank had been formed and carried on in good faith, and that nothing shall induce the directors to swerve from the path of the rictest honour. In answer to questions it was explained that the 2001. a-year periodically written off for the premises at Charing-cross willjust cover the cost of the lease. In order to increase the stability of the bank a larger smn than is usual is kept invested in Governui,nt aud other approved aecuritles, It transpired in the course of the meeting that the txpenheaofthe pr etuViu ot Messrs. LrAwson and Cockbnir amounted to 7001. Annexed is an abstract of the report and accounts- " Sinoo lat year cIrcumstances have transpired alc-u lated to test severely the soundness of the jointstcak banking system, and this bank has been espe. cially subjected to tri from the continued cirulatton of false and libellous statements. This annoyance was borner with for some time, until the directors were compelled most reluctantly to appeal to the hlw, which afforded its protection. It is no; necessary to allude to the subject further than to remark that the bank did not suffer any materil injury in consequence of those unprincipled attacks; the amount of bumsmesB acquired at tho date of the lst annusl report has not only been retained, but a steady increase in every important branch has taken lae. From the accounts it will be seen that the gross profit for the year, a'fter payment of 41 591 for interast to customers, amounte to the sum of 33,896., which, added to the reserve fund of 8,000. set apart last year, and interest thereon, gives 42,2161. as the amount of disposable profit at thi3 period. Out of this sum there have been defrayed current expenesst the head establishment and the Chain-cross branch; all bad debtslbave been written off, And amole provison made for doubtful debts, and income-tax patd Thee items amornt together to 17,865. Forrobate of interest on bills discounted but not matured there has been carried to profit and loss newa account the sum of 4,6131. It has been resolved to apply 5001. further towards writing off preliminary expenses, and 200L towards the branoh lease and building account. There has been already paid out of these profits a dividend, amounting to 7,500, declared In February last. These appropriations leave;a balance of disposable profits of 11,5371. Out of this it would have been agreeable to the directors to have declared a further dividend, but they have considered it right, and consistent with the course prsued last year, to value their Government securities at the price of the day on which the balance is taken. This valuation shows a depreciation, on the 30th of June last, to the aumount of 7,039M, which being deducted from the above balance of profits trenched upon the reserve fund, and determined the directors to make no distribution at this period. The alterations in Threadnoedle. street, for occupation and letting, are now brought to a close; the total outlay for purchase and improvements h'sa been 76,5101. The surplns property has also, with the exception of one suite of offices, been let on lease on advantageous terms. The property being freehold of most subsantial cbaracter it has been determined to treat the item 1S a permanent asset of 75,0001., upon which sum a return exceeding 5L per cent. perannum will be realized, includinw afairrental for tho bnk's oocupation; the separatebuildinu account of these premies is accordingly written off ana closed."

Great Southern and Western of Ireland dedined 1Z. and after 4 o'clock there was a further fall in dreat Western. A small reduction oGccuned in Grat Indian Peninaular, Scinde, and Great Westem of Canada. In French *hares, Namur and Iege and Paris and Lyons were rather weaker.

BLECTIOY COMMITTBES. TDR f)tlRR)A - At the sitting of the comsmittee yesterday morning the examination of Mr. Derinzy, the stipendiary magistratoe, wraa ued. He said that on the Monday evening before the election a application was made to him by Mr. Kelly for a police force to protect his house; but, thinking it would be unwise to -weaken the force by separatlng it olto detachments, he did not accede to the application. CYosexanmined by Mr. SLADE.-That was the Mr. Relly whosg house was wreaked on the Taesday evenlig. He had been a stipendiary magistrate for lt years. Ee consulted with the Mayor as to the measures that ought to be taken. If a riot had taken place he should have ordered the police to act, bat he should not have called out the military without the sanction of the High Sheriff He made a verbal a. gUatia to the High Sheriff for authority to act. On the ue. dayhe thought it prudent to have the cavalry stationed near to the White HoF in order that theymightbe ia reediness. When the priests addressed the mob they cheered and made-a great noise, and appeared excited. The cavalry were out for about two hours, until 6 o'clock inthe evening. There were such crowdain the 2treets that he was appre hengive of serious disturbance, and remaied oat until9 or 10 o'clock, when the streets were clear. On that night ther vere riots, and the mob attacked Mr. Kelly's house, where Captain loore had his committee-rooms. Mr. Mayne ten. dered him an information which, after ittle hedtat tlion, he received. When he saw that a seoond Information, presented by Mr. Mayne, reflected on the other authorities and on himseif he said it would have been more delioate onL the part of Mr. Maoie to have presented it to another magistrate. He then walked arm-ln-arm with Mr. MaynetofDr. Fogarty, whoreceivedthe information. The cavalry were also oQt on the nomination day from 12 until 4 o'clock. He was told that inflmsnatory speeches were made on the Wednesday evening, but he did not hear them. He told the cavalry when he dismissed them to be in readiness to oome out at a molenat's notioe. The town was much excited, thousands of people, men, women, and children, being in the streets. Ele saw stones flying bout, and heard abusive language used towards Cap. tain Moore's supporters, but no threats. At contested elections in Ireland the mob was never very peaceable. One stone paed cloee over his shoulders. He believed that the windows of Mr. Rowland, of his father, and of his brother were broken. As far as the breaking of glass went there was a riot. Two persons were taken up by the police, and he liberated them on bail. The men were prosecuted at the petty sessions, but the cases were dismissed, as they could not be identified. He did not see the windowe of the Protestant church or of the chapel of easO broken, and he received no official report on the subject, but he heard that they were broken. He saw very little of Mr. M'Cann during the election. He heard Mr. St. George Smiith say the town was in an alarming state and apply to the sheriff to take measures for its protection Witness said he would take measures to preserve the peace. The people were less excited on the Thursday than on the Tuesday and Wednesday. On the Thursday he brought out the infantry to show that they were available. B3 the Coar:M=Z.-He thought he had sqfficient force at hTs diposal to give protection to the voters at any time. Mr. James Gibney, a boiler-maker, said that at the time of the election he was a foreman in Mr. St. George Smith's iron-works. In consequence of instructions given by Mr. St. George Smith, witness and about 50 men attended the nominaMon, and shouted and interrupted Mr. M`Cann vhen he was speaking. They afterwards escorted Mr. St. George Smith and his friends to Captain moore's tallyroomn. They then went to a publichoase and got drink, for which they did not pay. He had been promised his waes for that day, but did not receive them. He was told they had not made noise enough. Cross-exanined.-The works were not stopped that day. He did not cheer Captain Moore, because he did not agree with him in polities. The Rev. Mr. Macklun, examined by Mr. P?riw said he was a Roman Catholio clergyman, and had been at Dregheda for seven years. Dr. Dixon, the Archbishop, was his Immediate superior. He was present on the Monday evening When the Revs. Mr. Hanratty, Mr. Montague, and Mr. O'Sullivan addressed the people. They urged the clins of Mr. ICCaun, and warned the people against bribery. He dia not hear either of them say that the Boyne hd run red with the blood of their ancestors. None of the priest said that those vho voted for M'Cann would vote for their priests, their religion, and their God, and that those who voted for Moore would vote :for the DeviL They exhorted the people to be peaceable. He made a speech to a sinilr effect on the Tuesday evening. He had never before spoken in pabli except in the chapel, and he was unwilng to speak then. He only used language such as might have been used by a layman under similar circumstances. For some time previous to the election religious exdtement had prevaled iAn tbe town, and offensive placards hled been postea up, desiating the Roman Catholic rohgion as idolatry. Cross-examined by Mr. SL&DE.-The greater part of his address consisted of eantions to the people against bribery. He was not present during the whole of Father Hanratty's speech. No one in his presence said that whoever voted for IM'Cann would vote for God Almighty, nor used any language of that kind. He spoke for about seven minutes. The speeches lasted for about an hour and a-half, but other per. sons spoke besides pries. He had not had the permission of Dr. DLion to speak. Re-exnmined.-He was subpcented by the petitioners. In 1852 there was no occasion to address the people, because there was no apprehension of bribery. The Rev. Patrick Hauratty, examined by Mr. PrmNN, said he was a Roman Catholic clergyman at Drogheda, and a voter. He made somo short addresses to the people on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in the election week. The effect of his remarks was to caution tbe people against bribery and against breaking the peace, and to urge them to Support a man who was a friend to the town, and oppose lhs enemies of the town and strangers. He aiso referred to tbe nanneries, and urged the people not to return a person who would probably support Mr. Spooner against Uaynooth, and wbo was opposed to nunneries, the nuns having done so much good to the town by teaching the poor. He said nothing about the Smiths. but he alluded to 'he Roman Catholics who had pledged themselves to Captain Moore, as a elas, and said they were contemptible for changing sides, and could not be respected as consistent ?olitical opponents. He never used the word " dispensation' ia his addresses. He did not make use of the words that whoever voted for M'Cann would vote for their religion, their priests and their God, nor of any such proface language. e had no doubt at all on that point. No priest, in his hearing, made use of any language of that kind. After the election he heard that some one had used the expression, and said It would be an excellent one to fasten on the priests for the purpose of a ptition. The purport of his speech in seconding Mr. NCaen-i at the nomination was th4t it would be creditable in the voters to suppor a gentleman who had done so much for the charities of the town, and was no stranger to it. He saw no acts of violence committed, bat he kner that some windows had been broken. His speech in seconding Mr. M'Cann was twice interrupted. Mr. Bro. dign. with his four supporters, was huzzaing for himsolf. (L%ughter.) Cross-examined by Mr. SLADE.-Neither he nor any one In his hearing said that whover voted for M'Cann would vote for God Almighty. He did not ask the people to vote for their priests. The effect of his remarks was that the people should avoid bribery, should support the Liberal interet, and should not be divided. He saw no stones thrown nor any spitting while he remained in the Courthouse. The Rev. F. Montague was then called, and said, in answer to llr. PHISNr, that Father Powvderly had been left in Drogheda to attend to the town during the absence of the rest of the priests. On cross-examinati'un he denied that he had ever asked the people to vote for their God, and said he thought such language impious, whoever used it. He did not tell them to vote for their priests, but he did tell them to vote for their religion and their country. He did not say that those who voted for Moore would vote for the Devil, and he did not usa the word "dispensation." Mr. Henry Clinton, the election agent of Mr. M'Cann, said that the instructions given by that gentleman were to incur no expenses that wvere not strictly legal, and that he had acted upon these instructions. He was weU acquainted 'with the constituency, and in his opinion Captain Moore had no chance of being returned without resorting to illegal Mr. James M'Cann, the sitting member, was then examined by Mr. PH1NN. He Esid he had represented the borough since 1852. At the last election he instructed his agent not to spend a single shilling in treating, bribing, or any other Illegal mnanner. He told all his friends that he would rather resign than have a pound spent in treating or for any other improper purpose. Neither Long, Wherty, nor any person, except Mr. Ciinton, had,any authority from bim to spend a single shilling. He declared that he would not have sp-ent a shilling ilegally if by so doing he could have secured his return. On being cross-examined by Mr. HODGnS Mr. M'Caun said he was not aware that the constituency contained a number of out voters. By the CHAIRMAN.-The out-voters 'were generally respectable people, wvho would not render any large expenditure necessary. Mr. Rlalph, the agent for Mr. MCann's election expenses, proved that the accont presented to the auditor was acca- This being the close of the oase for the sitting member, Mr. PHuNN summed up, and Mr. Si.ADE replied upon the whole oase. The room was then cleared, and the committee deliberated for about an hour. Upon the re-admiseion of the public. The CnAnMAN said the Committee had agreed to the following resolutions7:- " TbatJames' wOann, Esq., sdu14 eletedi a nrgess to serveo inthe Present P,7rliameut for the borough and county of Drogheda.

DUBLIN (CITY). The committee re-assembled at 11 o'clook yesterday mnorning. Mr. ht'DoNouGai stated that the witness Strong, against whom a warrant bad been issued, could not be found. The CnAIRxAN said he would report the fact to the House. The case In support of the petition having been closed, Mr. O'MALLEY opened the case for the sitting inember, stating tbat he should be able to bring forward evidenice in contradiction of the cases of bribery alleged by the petitioneZs. Mr. W. S. Frewen, the relieving officer of the Readd-street Infirmary, said he had never given John Hamilton a farthiDg on account of the elections, and aleo denied having rupplied him with clothes. He never gave Hamnilton a larger sum than 4d. or 6d. in his life. Mr. Frewen also distinctly denied that he had had any such conversation with Ilamilton as Hamilton bad stated in his evidence. Mr. J. B. Whitkezn, an att,rney, 6aid he had nevex, em. ployed Byrme or prolsed or given him any money on aecont of the election, and denied the statements made by Byrne on that subject Witne was not employed as an sen HehldaphidUr.Gibson for employment, but Mr. Gibson told sum that all the situations had been filled up. Byrne had saked him after the election whether he could get any roney. Witnecs replied that he could get none for hime-if, and if he could he would not take it. In his csexamntluatlon the witness admitted that some tears ago he had pl:iaded "Gailty to a charge of conspiraoe, ont entered into an explanation of the circumstances 1U order to showr that the charge involved nothing of a criminal nature or which redlected upon his character, le was et}lt Inpractice as a solicitor tand had not been struck off tho Mr. W. Gibson had practised as a solicitor in Dablin for the lsst 25 years, and was agent for the sitting members at the last election. They anticipated a large majority. He had the conduct of the election, and all the expenses were under his control and he was asfsted by Wr. kiartin. Not a shillng was spent to his knowledge beyond what appered In the audited accounts. Lilly occupied a subordiaato poeltion and had no kind of authority to make either promlses or payments. The witnes wazs examined at considerable length as to the constitution of the committees, which he said were made as numerous as possible with the object of frghtening the enemy, and also as to the arrangements made for the conduct of the election. Ee said, in crossexamination, that he was overwhelmed with applications for appointmenti, and he confirmed the staternent of a previous witness stoMr. Vance's declaration that he would give nothing to the Roes-lane Sodety. Mr. Ralph Cusack, a maglitrate of Dublin, and an agent for the election expenses of the sitting members, who has been frequently referred to in the course of the inquiry, ws aLso examined, and stated that both the hon. gentWemen repeatedly told him not to allow a shilling to be improperly expended, and that he had refused various applications for panment of expenses. According to these instructions, Li and Downes brought a list of persons to Mr. Gibson for en ployment, and three of them were choeen as tally-clerks, anthree as mesengers. le denied that the employment of any persons was at all colourable, but, on the contrary, every one employed had rendered ample service for the money he received. The witness was cross-examined at considerable length, but made no material deviation from his evidence in ehief Mr. Grogan the sitting member was next examined,He statedthat he had represented the city of Dublin since 1841, and Mr. Vance had represented it since 1852. Of late years considerable pains had been taken with the registration, and a report was made annually to him on the subject. From the last report he had reason to believe that he should have at least 1,000 majority. The only agents he auathorized were Mr. Gibson and Mr. Martin. Mr. Cusack was his agent for election expenses, and by the advice of Mr. Cusack he lodged a sum of money in the bank, and he was very careful to express a strong wish to his agents that no improper expenses ghould be paid. The question of travelling expensas was discussed in his committee, and it was especially agreed to make no promise to any one about them, they being considered doubtful expenses. He knew Lilly, but had never had any commurication with him, and oertainly had not recognized him in any way a3 an agent. The 5001. referred to, which had been promised to the Pretestant Orphan Society, was to be paid solely upon the condition of their raising 500. themselves, and it was intended to benefit the hospital without reference to the election. They failed to raise the additional 5001., and consequently he had never advanced the money. He had an interview with Mr. Cusack before the election, and strongly pressed upon him his wish that no improper expenses should be paild by him, Cros-examined by Mr. 3MDoxouoaL-Tn 1852, on the day of polling he took the lead, and kept it all day over Mr. Reynolds. Taking that into account, with the report of the Conservative PRegistration Society, he certainly expected that his majority would have been much larger over Mr. Brady than it turned out. He waS at a meeting of the freemen in the Music-hall the day before the nomination. He was not aware how long after the election of 1852 it was that he became a member of the Ross-lane Society. No doubt he heard the rules read or read them hinmself. By the Colnrrml.-He heard only last night that Mr. Vance had on one occasion made a promise in his (Mr. Grogan's) name. Mlr. Vance, the other sitting member, was then examined, and stated that no improper practices were resorted to In the election of 1852. Whenever he was in Dublin he took get inteoeft in the registration, and he attributed the fallin§ off of the numority to the apathy of the Conservatives, who did not exert themselves, thinking it was not neoessary. Mr. Vance further stated that his agents were the same as those of Mr. Grogan, and he had given them the stritest instructions not to expend a single farthing improperly, They lost an immense number of votes on account of the day of election being changed. He had not paid a farthing for election expenses, except the money paid by the agent for those expenses, He did not interfere in the question of travelling expenses, but left it to the committee. Mr. Vance gave the same explanation with respect to the offer of W. for the benefit of the Protestant Orphan Society as that given by Mr. Grogan. By the Coz.= rL-The society was a general Protestant orphan society, and the roposal was to give 5001. if the Protestants of Dublin wold raise another 6001. and to form a special branch for the children of the freemen of Dablin. The amount was never raised, and consequently their donation was never paid. He never directly or indirectly promised to give the 5001. to the Ross-lane Society. Cross-examined.-He was perfectly certain that he had not on the last election renewed the promise. Originally it was designed especially for the orphans of the freemen of Dublin, He often gave implicit injunctions to his agents not to spend money improperly. His instructions were perfectly bond lMde. His bond .fide conviction was that no Mooney had been spent improrly By the CAiRmAs.2IW-H was not aware till Mr. Cusck told him that oertain sums had been taken out of the funds of a society and expended in reference to the election. The mro,nnthe heardofthe cla.jm he repudiated it, and did not now intend to pay the money. Mr. Vance fther explained that when he told Maor Smith that if his election was to depend upon the Ross-lane freemen he would rather lose it he meant that if it was to depend upon any iUegal paymeent to those freemen he would rather lose it. This evidence clowd the case of the sitting members, and the committee then adjourned till this day at 11 o'clock.

IJBxLT:mT (for the asignees) thought the applia. tion would bo granted as of course. Mr. AMORY complained that he had not seen a copy of causes in respect of which the prisoner was detained.

The Cos Isszioinow gave judgment,characterizing the bankrupt's conduct in trade as reckless, and auch as could not be treated otherwise than with severity. The certifi. cate (third clAsa) would be withheld for 12 months from the day of hearing, without protection, which would not be allowed until the bankrupt had been in prison for three mnonths. IN BR WILSON AND WILSON. An order was obtained a few days ainoeby Messrs. Preeton and Webb directing a prosecution against both bankrupts on the unuds of embezzlement and non-surrender. Mr. SATESR, for creditors, applied that the order might be reviewed, on the ground that the ausets would be swept away in co8st in a prosecution; from which Mlr.

SUMMBE ASfSZES. ITrlMP.? nmrl>m7 CROYDON. ATTa- (Before the Caix BARON.) Mr. M. CLLmxnRs called the attention of his Lordship to the circumstance of the list of the causes that were arran-ed to be disposed of during the day, whioh had been fixed'on the door of the courthouse, having been torn down and taken away. The learned counsel said that it might have been done wantonly, but, possibly, the act had some other object, and ho therefore thought SS right to call the attention of the Court to the subject. The CBxi BAnox said, it was right It should be known that the act of wantonly removing such a list would amount to a contempt of court, and he should certainly punish any persons who were proved to have committed it. It has been arranged that the speoial jury causes shall all stand for trial before the Chief Baron, and that the conamon jury causes shall all stand in their order to be dis. posed of by Mr. Justice Willes after tho criminal buAsiness shal have been disposed of. CROWN SmDF-(BeforC Mr. Jutice WiLZs.) Alice Agnes Williamrs 35, was indicted for the wilfl murder of Henry John Bix. Mr. Watldn Williams conducted the prosecution; the prisoner was defended by 5r. Lilley. The facts of this case have appeared very recently in the polioe reports. The deceased, who seemed to have been a armlesa, inoffensive man, carried on the businces of a chandler's shopkeeper at Walworth, and it appeared that the father of the prioner had ran u a score with him which he was either unable or unwilling to pay, ad the deceased had sued him in the County Court, and an order wa made for the liquidation of the debt b7 the payment of a certain monthly instalmeint. This amount was net paid, and the deceased consequently obtained a judgment summon8, under which the father of tho prisoner was committed to the county gaoL This proceeding evidently excited the mo9t intenEe feeling of vengeance i the mind of the prisoner, and she was repeatedly ead to utter fearful threats against the un,ortunate deceased. On the 16th of July the prisoner want to the decead's shop, and abused bim in the most violent manner, an e repeatodiy ' sMd-t atO vtsh-aw 5 s him, and she should not mind being hong tot hinL The wife of the deceaed did all she could to keep her hulind from coming into contact with the prisoner, hut he con trived to make her way into the sho and ended a volley of abuse by striking the deceased a violent blow with a stone on the breast, and the evidence left no doubt that the ex citement occasioned by the attack that was made upon him and the actual violence he received were the causes of death. The jury found the prisoner Guilty of manslaughter, and sbe was sentenoed to six years' penal servitude, This case concluded the criminal business.
AT'PUITI .TNTT,n WELLS. AuG. 5. NTIs Piu COURT.-(Before Mr. Justice CRO rON.) STBJNrC5FIILD V. DARE. Mr. Smith and ar. Prideaux were counsel for the plain tiff; Mr. Serjeant Kiaglake and Mr. Baistow for the defendAnt. This was an action to recover damages for a libel pub. lished by the defendant, the proprietor of a nsper at Weston-super-M1are, against the character of the pIalntifi¶ a surgeon residing in that town. It seemed that there were two parties who either blessed or cursed this little watering-place. There was a dispute about a band which had been provided for the amusement of the visitors; one party brought one band and the other anpported another; one started a public dispensary, the other party immediately set up another, so that both fel to the ground; and so it would appear with almost every. thing that was suggested. A newspaper was started, and amother was then brought forward, and tbe interests and views of the different parties were therefore taken care of and protected. The libel in question was published with reference to the band, and an occasion was taken to write an abusive article on the plaintiff, charging him with improper and creel conduct towards his father The matter, however, was of a perfectly local character, and would not he understood by any who were not residents in the town of Weston-super-Mare. After a lengthened trial the jury gave a verdict for the p)laintiff-Damages, 504 gBARKS v. BOWE? This was an action brought by the plaintiff, a carver and gilder at Bath, against the defendant, who is an extensive glass manufacturer at West Bromwich, Staffordshire, to recover the sum of 251, for work and labour bestowed upon certain looking-glass frames. The defendant paid 01. into court, and denied that the value of the work exceeded that amount, alleging that the chages were excessive, the work boadlyperformed, and careles.ly packed in the cases, by which the work was greatly damaged. Mr. T. W. Saunders appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Collier, Q.C., for the defendant. The case occupied the time of the Court for severalhours, and ultimately the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for 11, 2s. beyond the amount paid into court. Jane Eing was indicted for stealing meat, bread, lard, and butter from the Hon. Charles Napier, her master, near Taunton. Mr. Cole prosecuted and Mr. Edwards defended. It appeared that the prisoner, who was 72 years of age, lived in the service of Major Napier as cook. She had asked permission to go to a fneral. As she was about to leave the ouse for that purpose some suspicion was excited, and she was searched, and the following was the result:-Under her dress and under her armstherewassomelard, andunder her ciinoline were bread, meat, and butter, The prisoner was foand Guilty. The same prisoner was then charged with having committed a similar offence three days previously. The other servants proved having seen the prisoner taking jars of jam and other articles of a eimilar nature. The prisoner was Conrvicted, and was sentenoed to nine and six months' imprisonment,

After disposing of several undefended actions, his LordAhip was occupied nearly the whole d.y with the case of PRITOET V. CRXMONTNL Mr. Serjeant Pigott and Mr. Scotland appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Skinner, Q. Q, and Mr. Davis for the defendant. Theplaintiff in this action, . J. PrIltchitt, was formerly a furniture-dealer at Birmingham, and he sued the defendant, P. Cremonini, a furniture-dealer at WolverhaLpton, to recover damges for slander spoken by the defendant of the plaintiff, imputing to him that he had been in prison for debt, and that he would soon be in prison again, and was totally unworthy of credit. The defendant pleaded the general issue, and also a plea slleging that the plaintiff had been in prion for debt, Several witnesses wvere called on both sides, who occupied the Court and jury nearly the whole day. In the result the plaintiff obtained a verdict, with one farthmng damages, CRIMINL COU1RT.-(BeforC Mr. Baroes BRAXWIxL) George Sparrow, alias williams, was charged with a burglary, with violence, in the house of William Holborrow, a farmer living by himself in the vlUage of Leighterton, on the nih of the 27th of April. Mr. Crippsappeared for theprosecution; Mr. Powel defended the prisoner. It appeared that at about 1 'clock in the morning the prosecutor was roused from sleep by noises at his door. He bad scarody time to jump from his bed when the door was burst open and three men rushed in upon him, They had dark lanterns in their hands, and long black calico dresses, which came down nearly to the ground, and hoods which surrounded their faces, leaving only opnings for eyes and rmouth. After a violent struggle the prosecutor was thrown down oa the bed, and one of tbe men produced a piece of wood, on which there were tied two strings, and this ntrument, which was produced in court, was evidently constructed for the purpose of being tied into the mouth, so as to prevent any cries being made. The stick was wrapped round with calico, which had been dipped in some mixture, by which the prosecutor's mouth and lips were burnt, and which immediately rendered him insensible. After remaining inthisstateforan hour he was roused again by the villains, who threatened to blow his brains out unless he instantly disdosed where his money was. Under the in. fluence of these threats he gave up above 1001., with which the men at last decamped, leaving tbe prosecoutor effectually gggged with the stick, his arms pinioned behind him, and hIs legs also tied together. In this helpless state he was found at about 5 o'clock in the morning by his carter, and at length released. The evidence against the prisoner was entirely circumstantiaL Four men who were strangers at Leighterton had been observed there on the previous Saturday, at avery early hour in the merning; and two boys, by wbom they had been seen, spoke confidently to the fact that the prisoner was one of the foar. AU trace of them, however, had been lost during that day and the folowing Sunday; but on the evening of Monday, on which night the burglary waa committed, two of those men were seen in a publichouse in the adjoining village of Didmarton. The landlord, who now identified the prisoner as one of the two men, had also observed the bundle which they were carrying with them, and which was tied up in a coloured silk handkerchief. This handkerchief furnished the most important link in the evidence, for a handkerchief similar in pattern, and generaUy resembling the one seen by the landlord, was found in the pasge of the prosecutor's house on the maorning after the robbery. The landlord further deposed tbatheaccompaniedthe two men who had been at his house with the bundle on the road towards Jedbury at 8 o'clock on the Monday night; that as he left them he observed them leave the road, and soon afterwards come back to a turn which leads to Leighterton, at about two miles distance, after which he had lost sight of them. The prisoner, on his apprehension, denied all knowledge of Lghterton or Didmarton, and it was contended on his behalf that this was the fact, and tha the witnesses who spoke ,o his haincg been at those places must have been mistaken. Mr. PowELL having addressed the jury, the prisoner ws found Guilty Mr. Baron BRAWM. then ordered sentence of death to be recorded, but intimated that it would not be executed. Alfred Bartlett, aged 23, servant, was chuaged with burglary in the house of Mary RestalL, at Bisley, on the 18th of May, -S 7, and stealing various articles, her property; also with cutting and wonding the said Mary PRestal]. There was also a count which chaged the prisoner with an intent to murder. The Driseaer confessed the first pert of the charge, but pleaded "NWot Guilty" stoathe intent to murder, Ir. STATON, who appeared for the prosecution, said that, with his Lordship's sanction, he would offer no evidence in support of the count wrhich charged an intent to murder. Mr. Baron BA,wLL having expressed his eoncurrence, The Jury found the prisoner ot Guiery upon that count. His LORDSi ordered sentnce of death to be recordod.

When we have completed the above lst of new engaeements by the addition of Signor COita an artist whO ghes efficiency to the le importnt personages of au oper,& and Signor Visletti, * "basso profondo" of mor a than average merit% who was recently checked in his aeer by an unfortuate accident, it will be en tat the quntity of fresh lyrical stock Is indeed oonbderble. Mademoiselle Piocolomin had so firmly eathblihd herself with the publio lst year thabt u far s her populiity went, she had little to achieve beyond the maintenance of herpodtion. Shehadalreadym adepleantheunpleast tYv and the agreemable AFigla dc Begimenio had boen well saoned by her own very efficient spice. Nevetbe. let the favourable impressgon which he mnade at the close of lat seaon was rather due to bistrionic talent th to vocal proficiency, and henoe her admirers, whom name Is "legion," wmere delighted this year to observe the peat program she had made a a singer. Theb Tes and the management thereof had both -advaned dnee the summer of 1856, and not Ouly has dnmatic expredion been applauded, but execution, oeddered apart from the utterance of entiment, has been tbe theme of admiration. If the Idolatry of Mademoiselle Piocolomint is to be attributed to some inexplicable fascination, the fcination, at any rate, is proof aginst wear and .ear, and the look and smUie d ofAdemoiselle Picosloml re as potent now as they were when they first shone upo the revived fortunes of a newly resuscitated ertablislU4t, The production of Le No=rc di Figaro proved a for1Inate event for this charming artist, as Sunnak ha beea oue of h1 next sueamfln lmDesocations.

Signor Beneventno ha rather advanced th receded in publicetimton, and Signor Roul, whoae visit to us was somewhat te, ha maintained his character s a careful wc rer of the mmatle dropped by Lablache. The decrianing ability of Italy to furnish the theares of other conntries with new lyric dramas ha long been a matter of note. Of ephemeral succese in the ative land of the composers we hear much, but the shouts incident to the several ovations re seldom echoed in any Cislrine region, and we read of laurels profusely bestowed in Venioe&or Milan, without earing to iquire int* the proportiona between merit and it reward. Not adngle new Italirn opera has beenprodnoedin London thisnyear. At Hrr Majeaty's Theatre the favourite works of the Verdi coDeetion have stiU been It Toroto d and La Travis, and lWlini and Donizetti are still represented by their moat popular opera. From the very frequent performance of Don Gwovaini during theeason, and the great suces that attended the revival of LeZ No=z ds Figaro in the extra aeason, we may infer that classical unndc is morehily valued in this country than the generality of modern oom positions. Some years since tho ead wsu almost as important in the eyes of operatio patrons as the lyrical performance by which it was preoeded. Indeed, the acolamstions with which triumphant vocalists were greeted, though perhaps more respectful, were less enthusistic thn those that folowd the achievements of the successful danoer. But Terpsichr is no longer in the anendant, and if she is honoured a s pleasant auxiliary to the lyric mnse she may deem herolf sufficiently fortunate. No balct on the grand old scale ha been produoed this year, nor was anything of the sort r- quired, and yet there has been s great abundane oft chore graphic talent. Mademoiselle Poochini, who opened the seaon in an abridged ersion of La Xemerakld, was not only a perfect mixtress of her art, but a thoroughly origil genius, whose Truai.daie, if executed a down ago, would have enhanced the price of bouquets admo Rotati, who so exquisitely combines the qualities of tMe dancer and the actress, Mademoiselle Marie Taglioul, who repre=ent the severe school of Terpsichorean art, and Mademoiselle Bosobetti, who has risen to unwonted eminenee, hbave all contributed to make the past season illustrious; and assstars of thewseond magnitude we have had Mesdemoiselles Bolla, 8savione, and Katrine, spar ing an all beholders Moreover, there was a Peninsur party tht took delight in the Iberian graces of Senore PereosNomn. In closing our brief record, let us not omit t tae tlat a strong sypa with the manager of the old eStablishmet ast beenea leadug sentiment with the whole dtefMhis pa trons The "restoration," hailed with sucheusit tic cheers in 1856, hs turned out to be the commenoeent of a permanent state ot thing, and the operatic "eoavliere find cause to rejoioe in the unshaken solidity ot tbe ancent institution.

We dared not go to bed st night, and our days were full of 3aticipated horrors. At las' things wore sO gloomy an aspect that I sent off an express to rmy darling hnaband for his advice. Another express was sent y -the authorities here, urging him to lose no lime in col,ecting all the forces under his como and and come to lNeemuch for the protection of the inbabitants. He did so, and set out with cavalry and infantry and a couple of gPus -altogether 1, 500 men, marching gO miles in three days with a burning sun and hot winds blowing. In the meantime a timely notice was given to my boys that the mutiny would aeon take place, and the coming storm seemed so nearthat we left Our home just as wo were on the point of sitting down -to dinmer with merely_a cbange of clothes in our hands, and -went off to a place about 10 miles distant, where our eldest son had the care of a sm all fort. We arrived there late at might with a couple of very frightened friends, whom we p,otected on the way ; and, though we did sleep on the ground, we thought ourselves fortunate in having comparatively safe ground to lie down upon. One day of rest and then came the storni; all Neemuch in flames, and all terror stricken. My boys guarded the fort by night and by day. We 'were every hour expecting the people of the city (Jewud) to riEe and destroy us, when early In the morning there came to the gates 15 officers, six ladies, and three young bhildren. They had all run for their lives, We let them in. They bad run aD the way, w-ith only the clothes on their backs. We fed them, and tried to give them that hope and comfort of which- we ourselves were destitute. An hour afterwards, and a bright gleam of sunshine I Who should arrive t our help but my Itsband and two boys? Tbey had come on 16 sniles a-head of the little army, wbich was too knocked up to proceed, This wae real joy for the tine, bht was soon damped; for not mnany bours passed beforo the intelligence came that all the mutineers, with their guns, were on their way to attack Jewud; and as we well knew that the fort coald not reist guns, we al, with our oompanions in misery, made a clear start to my husband's camnp, 16 miles off, which we reached, jaded, terror-stricken, and aU very dirty. Again ,we all slept on the ground, my husband and boys doing everything for everybody; and the foUowing day we took our little army to do battle with the insurgents; bht they had heard of Charles and his force, and started off another road. The cowardly rascals had sent their messengers into Charles's camp, and offered 1,000 rupees for his head, and 500 for each member of his family; and this, 'we have since learned, was done through the medium of two men who have for the present escaped hanging, whose bad conduct at Jeypore had caused their imprisonment in the gaol at Neemuob. The nmutineers had broken open the gaol, and these men joined them. Well, we returned to Neemuch, and found not more than half-a-dozen people left-rain and desolation in every direction. None of us escaped with more than one changc of garments, some not even that; and all hero are alike beggars. Our house, like all others, is a ruin, a shell, without one article left us. Our beautiful books, either torn or burnt ; our furniture broken up, chopped in pieces, or carried of; not a cup, plate, or glass left; carpets torn up, or carried away ; not a single garment of any kind; our silver dbhes gone; doors, windows smashed ; trinkets and curiosities, of which I had a goodly store, all taken away or destroyed-even the pictures and punkabs, and the chimney pulled down to see If anything had been hidden in it. We have now nothing left. The shopkeepers have lost everything, so that we have not the means of buying common clothes. Charles has lost property to the amnount of 14,000 rupee Ouown servants awsisted in the plnder, and they loaded four of our horses to carry away the most valuable npartof ourproperty. Luckily. we had camels andhorses 'with us on our flight, or these also would have been taken. I vill say no more now ; but this is but a small portiosa of our woes. Lsst night I slept on a couch. It is the first time for 15 nights that I have had so good a bed, and lst night I took off my clothes; for 13 nights I dared not do this for fear that we should again have to fly. Our boys have behaved most bravely and nobly, and their condaut -has been justly admired by all. My husband has the proud satisfaction of knowing that he saved (through the mercy and gaidance of God) "ot only the lives of his own wifo and children, but of his brother oTicers and their fanilies, and all belonging to Neemuch, and this all most gr&tefully aoInowledge. Had he not coe eto our rescue when he did every soul of us would have been murdered. We are not yet out of danger. It hangs over every white face in this portion of unhappy India; and I ask your prayers and those of all mny dear brothers; we need all your prayers to God on our behalf. Jl. J. B.

Now that we are prepared I do not think we shall be attacked, unless disturbances arise in the NTizam's country, which is in a very unsettled state, and which is on our frortier.

Sir,-The writing on 'he wall hardly puzzled the Assy. rians more than the revolt of the Sepoys has perplexed people in Ergland. It is written in characters which European knowledge cannot decipher. To me, who once knew Upper India and its people as well as I now know Northamptonshire, tbe interpretation seems easy and plain. I will try in a few words to malke it so to your readers. The Sepoys of the Bengal army are recruited from particular districts of Upper India-I maynalmost say from particular villages. Father brings sou, uncle nephew, brother brother, til there is a vast deal too much of relationship be. tireen the Sepoys of the several regiments. This I believe .o be the main cause of the universality of the revolt, To ask one regiment of Sepoys to attack another composed of their near relations is demandiDg a good deal. I have no doubt whatever that an honest though mistaken Velief in our desire and intentionto putdeown.thairLreligion has been tho sole cause of this outbreak. By a rnost foolish subservience to ignorant saints the Government have for years past given far too much countenance to missionarnes and schemes for conver&ion of the natives to Christianity. Tho Sepoys, who are in ncore direct connexion with 'Euro. peAss than any other olass, have seen this movement more plainly than otbers at a distance, and their distrust has in consequence been more confirmed. The cartidgesset fire to material which our own policy bad made itflamniable. Our offlcers should and would have undeceived their men, but they have long lost their power and influence. In the Bengal army proraotion to the Sepoy goes by seniority, and the officera have therefore literally no power of rewarding those men in whom they have the most confidence, while by a complex code of general orders, &c., it is extremely difficult to degrade a troublesome or ill-disposed native officer, who is sharp enongb-as they generally areto keep just within the line of his duty. All Asiatics worship power and despise in proportion the want of it. WVhere xegimental officers bave promotion and punishment at their command their power and influence over the Sepoys is immense. They are looked upon as demigods. Bu6, as I bave aaid, this state of things does not exist in the Bengal regular army. In the irregular force it partially does, and to that and enlistment from more scattered sources do I attribute the general abstinence of those bodies from revolt. In one or two regiments where thas been otherwise special reasons might be given, to which I need not now refer. The conduct of these irregular troops shows also that it is not by a number of officers that weo snintain order, Except on active service, where we Yours faithfully, EDINA. Aug. 4.

Th Sepoy is no aacquaintance of yesterday, and in aU past time his docility has been remark able, Bat there is one point upon which, high caste or low caste, he is not to be touched lightly, We have made a blander, and our officers have not had the power and infha. enue reqizite to explain it away.

HOnurt=z TRAGSMY nr AxEnRrA.-We have to cbroniole oOe of the most horrible tragedies ever committed in this city, hardly excepting the famous torpedo case whereby Mr. and hrrs. Allison met with a fearful death by the diabolical agency of the unhung Arrison. We attx the particlarM together with the verdicts of the coroner's ju-ry. The publio in the meantime are in a high state of excitement, ad the bloody episode will long be regarded with fearful interest by our citizens. At About 4 o'clock yesterday nmorning the mansion occupied by Mr. Nicholas T. Ilorton, in Ohio-avenue, at the head of Vine-street-hill, was discovered to be on fire. Judge Parker, whose iesidence is upon the opposite side of the way, was aroused by the screams of the inmates of Mr. Horton's house, and speedily dressinghiniself he rushed to the scene, wheu upon entering the hall he disoovered a gentleman named Concklin endewvouring to remove the prostrate body of Mir. -Horton. The smoke waa suffocating, but between them they succeeded in carrying their charge to the lawn, when it was discovered that he was bleeding profusely frora a cat inflicted ix the head, and a dreadfu,i gash, given evidently by the downward stroke of some 8harp weapon in the left groin, and which had severed the femoral artery. He appeared sensible, but was speechless, and in a few moments breathed bis last. Previous to this, and at the first alarm of fire, the mother of Mr. Horton rushed into the halt, when sae perceived her unfortunate son-in-law staggering towards the bedroom of his wife, who had but recently been confined, and exclaiming, " Oh, mother, I am stabbed," he fell upon the spot; wbore he was discovered by Judge Patker and Ur. Conckliu. In the mesntime the excitement had spread, and some firemen from the Mohawk engine-house arriving upon the spot the fire was soon extinguished, and suspicion aving falen upon a serving man niamued Joseph Loefner, I to had for upwards of two years been engaged in the family of Mr. Horton, some perons hastened to a houe at the corner of 'Vine and Green streets, in which Loefner's Vwife resided. In a few minutes afterwards, however, and while the p arty assembled in front of the house were yet in a state of horrid bewilderment, Loefner was seen staggeriag towards them from a neighbouring orchard, bleedlng profusely from a cut in tbo hand and a horrid gash across the throat. Some of the party advanced to meet him, but he .sunk upon the grass upon hands and knees. They traced the blood to an apple tree, beneath which they found a large sharp butcher's knife and a razor. Witlh the formner be had inflicted the fatal blow which had deprived Mr. IHorton of life, and with the latter he had attempted to accomplish his own destruction. When interrogated as to whether he had committed the arson and murder, he nodded (for he was speechless) assent, and also that he had cut his own throat. In the meantime the party who had first started in pursuit of him arrived at the residence of his wife, but found the door of the room locked. Subsequently they burst it in, and tbhre, stretched nearly naked upon the bed, but with her shoes on her feet, they beheld the dead body of the ill-fated wife of the murderer of Mr. Horton, no wound upon her person but otherwise exhibiting marks which made it evident that she had died from strangulation. The wretched loan, Joseph Loefner, was renoved to the Commeroial Hoepital, where at a late I our last night he lay in speechless agony, the attendants I expecting momentarily that he wonld breathe his last. He b bad previously signified by siges that his motive for comI nutting this double mnrder, suicide, and arson, was jealousy of his wife and Mr. Horton, and afrer being taken to the hospital hesacceeded in tracing upon a 0sate the intelligible characters4that he had reason to believe his wife on the day previous had given bium poisoned butter upon his bread, and which had caused the atteravtion that bad led to her murder, after which he had bastened to the house of Mr. ,lorton, in the front basement of which he usually slept, I where he kindled the fire with the intention of burning the house and its inmates, but mebting Mr. Horton, who was aroused by the smoke, he inflicted the fatal stab and then rushed forth into the orehard to consummate his own destruction. The fire which Loefner had kindled vwas immediately underneath the apastment occupied by Mrs. Horton. Mr. Horton, in consequence of the recent confinement of his lady, occupied a sleeping room on the other side of the hall, and in the rear of the house. He was an old and respected citizien, aged about 50 yers, and leaves his wife and six children to mourn his loss. He was an extensive manufacturer of gates and msarbled iron, dpsg buknia zhird,satreet, bettet BSRce imsd him, the mannfactory being in Plam-street. Tho firm was known as 2licholas T. Uorton and Co. Formerly he was in copartnership with Mr. Baker, aBd more reeently the firm was known as that of Hortoa and ZMacy, but this connexion was dissolved two years since. Ioceph Loefner, the murderer, is barely 22 years of age, and is said to have on several occasions exhibited a violent and ungovernable disposition. Hle was engaged bv Mr. Horton as a gardener and to take case of the borses, and it is said that upon one occasion when the harness became entangled he seized a knife and out it to pieces, after which he turned and served his coat wbich was hanging from a peg in the stable in the same manner. The evening previous to the tragedy he had been reprimanded by Mfr. Hiorton for exercisiDg undue cruety to the horses, and it is said that at that time he had muttered dark and malignant threats. He was a German by birth, but bas lived in this country for years. Francisca, his ill-fated wife, was a beautiful German girl of some 2) summers. Her maiden name was Koehler, and it was by this name that both bshe and her husband were most fzequently called. She had contraoted the ill-fated marriage bat a short eight months, and was five menths advanced iv pegnancy. To a beautitfl and expressive face, and a foral faultless in its symmetry, she is said to have combined the mnore lasting charmso of amiability of disposition, and-a singularity for her station-a refined and cultivated mind. Like Desdemona, she suffered by the green-eyed and unfounded suspicion of her jealous tyrant, and met, too, the same death as that inflicted by the Moor upon his pure and spotless wife. It will be seen by the testimuony elicited at the inquest held over her body that for same time previous to the fearful d6noament her life had been clouded, and the eager hope which, for one in her situation, about for the first time to be invested with the . caured title of mother, is ever- spposed to shed a rosy halo over the new and nmysterious existence, destroyed by hercruel and unamiable partner.-Cincinnati Commc-cia', Jaly 22.

' ' We do not know the authority for -the mnqdote of the young American traveller -who, b?asting of, his father's picture gallery, and being aikea d What masters it contained specimens, answered, '5 Ohb my father's picturesiare all LeonardosanRpes except a few (Correggioa2' and R.phsela T1ae Italian picture dealeri can teatj(t to thse fatct~ t.h.at ericanl touris'ts are among their beat and' greenest customers. There is no inVestment a to which experience is more essentialy to be bought. than pictures, and, at the present atageof estheties in America, there is still a great deal of experience to be purchased by Transatlantio batyers of sroked canvases and elaborately worm-eaten panels. Still, Yohn Bull has no right to crow too loud over Jonathair on this score. It is only of late years tbat our owr. picture buyers have begun to learn that moderm works of art are a safer investment than old ones, however magnificently christened; and we cannot believe that Yankee shrewdness will be far behind British in this respect when once a school of genAiine American art has come into existence, finding themes in the life and nature of the New World. Theltiited States long lived on2 the literature of the mother country. But nowthey arebeginningto lendas well as borrow. Washington Irving, Cooper, and Bryant led the way. Mrs. Beecher Stowe, flawthorn, Long, fellow, Lovel, and a score of ninor poets and Inovelists, have followed, and now count almost as many readers in the Old World as in the New. |As t iwthliterature we cannot but hope it will soon be with art. Americanl originality and grasp are too great to be long con6ned to the fle1d« of induatrial or mechanical activity. NVith such a country and such a race we cannot but look forward to a neiv and national development of painting also. In sculpture high honours have already been woon by Americans. Powers and Greenwood rank among the first sculptors whom Florence has educated, and our own Gibson has declared he has nothing to teach Miss Harriett Eormer, a young American lady, whose statue of Beatrice Cenci formed one of the most prominent ornaraents of the sculpture-roona at this year's exhibition of the Royal Academy. But in paintinm-aince Aliton and Stewarthe United States Save not boasted any name of more than local celebrity. It is true that they have given us Newton and Leslie, -but they rank as English and not American painters. Under these circumstances we note with peculiar pleasure the arrival in this country of a remarkable picture, by an American landscape painter, of an American eubject,-at once the grandest and the most deant of all ordinary pictorial power, among the many scenes which the NewTv World offers to the artist. The painter is Mr. Frederic Edward Church, and the subject is Niagara. Few scenes have been more often attempted, by the pencil, and none has hitherto more completely laughed it to scorn. But Mr. Church has painted the stupendous cataract with a quiet courage and a patient elaboration, which leave us, for the firat time, satisfied that even this awful reality is not beyond the range of human imitation. Mr. Church's picturo is an oblong of some seven or eight feet by three and a-half, if our eye have not deceived us. The view is taken from the Canadian side, a little above Table Rook, and it [includes the whole sweep of the Horaeshoe Fall, tg the corner of Goat Island. There is no foreground or shore. The spectator lookaright along the Canadian rapids, as their swirls converge for the tremendous leap, A sbattered tree-trunk i8 caught in the opposing eddies, which churn and chafe into foam over the layers of brown rock, the sunlight atriking their edges into transparent green where they fling thenselves over the lips of the ledges, in their hurrying course to the plunge of the mighty river. About the centre of the picture the bend of the barrier enables us to watch the downward leap of the river, not in a sheet, but in innumera'ole cascades from every projecting point, shivered into fine fringes of foam, and losing themselves in the spray to which the mass of water is churned by its fall. Across the wet air of this spray cloud the rainbow flings its prismatic arch. Beyond we see the distant lines of foam that mark the rapids, and further still the terraces of the Cvhippavay shore fushed with the rich hues of American autumnal forest. TDe time is towvards evening. A few streaks of purple cloud break the calm expanse of golden sky. The characteristic nerit of the picture is sober truth. It bears throughout unmistakable evidence of the most close and successful study. To paint running water is always difficult. But when the runnin water is the expanse of a miglhty river, broken into countless eddies by rock ledges, and hnnzing tb such a fall, it may well be conceived wvhat labour has been necessary to apprehend the bewildering facts, what patient mastery to represent them, so as to leave the spectator impressed, as by the presence of the stupendous reality, with the abstraction of motion and sound. Mr. Church's picture is on view at Messrs. Llovd's in Gracechurch.street, previously to its being entrusted to the hands of the chromolithographer. p
THE PU SCHOOL MATCHES. TO T1R EDITOR OF TlE ThI ES. Sir,-Feeling the deep interest natural to a public schooP man in the subject of MT. 0. James8's letter which appeared in 27sc Tinws of Wednesday, I venture to suggest to you some of the fallacies on which that gentleman founds his opinion. Re relies, fistly, on the bad effects a week in London is supposed to h. .e on the boys who look on as well as on those who play. Secondly, he says that an equivalent is found for the * Lord's ma-ches' by removing the scene of contest to the cricket-grounds of the respective schools. Thirdly, he implies that the sohools themselses ptefer this arrangement; and, fourthly, he attributes the present ferment on this subject to the selfishness and laziness o "some old Stonians and others" who object to the trouble of leaving London to see these matches played. As regards his first ground, Mir. James appears to have forgotten, or not to have understood, how entirely you cut it away from under him ia your admirable article of the 30th of July. Will nothing induce Elton masters to perceive tbat if during the holydays parents allow their sons to play in these snatches, or to witness them, neither of which they are in the least compelled to do, the rsonsi. bility rests on them, aud not on the masters? The indulgence of parents in this respect is Eeldom abused, for, as I have had the best possiblo opportunities of observing the manner in which boys behave during these matches, I can bear witness to their uniformly steady condutet, at least in the case of the school to which I belonged. Now for the assertion that playing these matches at the schools themselves is an equivalent for their talkng place at *Lord's." Let me remind Mr. James that as he knows old public schoolmen do not allow this to be the case, so he is much mistaken in supposing this opinion to be entertained by the schools themselves. I should be well contented were the matter to rest on their decision; but the fact is that what used to excite to so great a degree the youthful ranbition of public schoolboys was not merely the distinction of playing in their respective elevens, bat of performing before the pablio in London where thousands coUected daily to witness the result of their skill. Such applause as might there be gAined was a reward -worth striving for. The younger boy%, who might not at the time be able to witness these matches, yet preferred that they should be played at Lord's for tkey hop4d the day would comei~ when they fiSemir;ves migh t enjoy a similxr distinction. It might be contended that it Is a somewhat harsh measure to accuse old public scboolsnen, com. prising, as they do, a large portion of London society, of selfish laziness, because engag6d by professionzl occupations they caunOt leave town, and are therefore prompted by 'rheir affection for the places of their education to suggest that these contests should again take place within their reach. But putting aside their claim for the present, I mnst say that tne presence of a large class of mea who took a personal interest in the success of the players used to add in no small degree to the hononrable pride felt by those who on such ?ccasions distinguished themselves, and was thus an additional incentive to that strenuous exertion of mind and body^ wfithout which a place in "the SEleven" could not fo:nerls be obtai ne,. lin,,l. as 1 _ot io, iho , AA AA ONE WHO HAS PLAYED FOB HHff W166 Ang. 6.

Asalready intimated to the proprietors, the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Company h%ve thought fit to declare at an end, and without any notice, the agTeemnent wbich was made between the companies in July, 1854. The correspondence and documents which have been placed in the hands of the proprietors 'will enable tbenu to form an opinion as to this proceeding. The effect of thisastepon the part of the Manchester, Sheffield, atnd Lincolnabire Company is to extend the competition for Manchester and |Lonon tdsffia, by mneans of an additional, but circuitous route, and one never conteroplated by Parliameut. The report states that in consequence of proceedings in Chancery, instituted by Mr. J. Bwrkil, a holder since the 23d of December last of 2001. stock in the company, and also a director of-the Great Northern Railway Compary, a traffic agreement between the London and North-Western and Midland Railway Companies was cancelled and put an ernd to, in order to avoid the expenses of protracted litigation; but this was done without interfering with the friendly relations which have so long subsi4ted between the two companies They mention the circumstance in order to show how difficult it is to maintain similar friendly relations v,ith the Great Northern Railway Company. The directorsrequestthe vote of the proprhetors for useful works requiring an outlay in the aggregate of 10T,2551. The balance brought into the account thIs half-year nmounted to o0401., and the amount carried over to the next account 7,7?oll, rwhile at the corresponding period of 1556 the amount brought into that account was 48,5111., and 14,0761, carried over to the folltwing account. The half-yearly statement of accounts is appended to the reporti, and it is as usual vlaborate and clear. The total raceXpts on capital account to the 30th of June last amounted to 33,925,3401., and the expenditure to 32,941,407L, leaving a balance of 983,9331. The expenditure on the main lines and rolling stock amounted to 27.741,605., arDd on lines ia which the company have an interest 5,199 801!.

The expenditmre on capital account from the 31st of Decenber, 1849, to the 30th of June, 1857, amounted to 4,749,3761., including 233,8161. for the past balf-year.

Mr. L. Crombie, the secretary, read the minutes of the last ordinary and speoial meetings, wbich wero confirmned. The report (an abstract of vwhich appeared in The Tines. of 2londay -vas taken aa read. The CAir,slAs, in moving the adoption of the report, said he would be as brief as possible. With regard to the part of it relating to the dividend, he was sorry ib was not more satisfactory. They bad progressed during the past five years in their dividends, but the present one showed a retrogression, and, alchough it was not a bd dividend, it -was distasteful to receive less than thcy might have expected. In the correspondinu period of 1856 the gross receipts had been considerably inereasedcby the naval review and the Governntert traffic. These twoitems amounted to 36,5001., and as the half-year ending the 30th of June last showed a deficiency of 21,0001. as compared with the corresponding period, it was clear that an nmorease must have taken place in their ordinary tratfio to the extent of the differenoe between those two sums If any proof of that were required it would be found tbht the Government duty on the conveyance of passengers amounted to a larger sum in the pasthalf-year than in the same period of 1856, when the gross traffic was 21,0001. more. That was explained by no duty beiDg chargeable on the conveyance of Gavermuent troops, The ordinay traffic of the line was positively on the increase, although tbe gross receipts appeared less. It was however, somewhat discouragin to work against such a year as 1856 of extraordinary trsa. In July, 1856, they received 8,277&. for Government troops, so that there appeared to be a falling off in their gross receipts in July, 1857; and although other months in the balf-year might be affected in that way to some extent, yet on the whole he expected a satisfactory result from the traffio of the current half-year. (Hear, hear.) Als to their position otherwise, they had pRssed through Parliamnent uri^ng the present session unscathed. They had been saved the expense of constructing the proposed line from Romsey to Redbridge, which they had been compelled to bring for. ward iA self-defence against the broad gauge projeot. They had been favaured in other respects, and their interests had been proteoted. On the eastern side of their boundry they were in friendly relations with the Brighton Company, m-atually facUitating and exchanging their traffic aud lie might mention that it was a matter of regret witL the dixectors to seo the South Coast Corpany sanctioning lines , ^roaaM1&.-Bsas,which.woui'd probsbly take their traffic from Petworth and Petersfleld, which now^ came upon their line. The Portsmouth line from Havant to Godaluing would accomnmodate a large portion of that country. With_regard to the line near London, projected from Wimbledon to E;PSOM, and promote by other parties, it waS a line the company attemnpted to carry some years ago, but had failed to obtain powers to make it. Being in friendly relations with the Brnghton Conipany they did not wish to see it promoted, and with that view tbey opposed the Bill both in the House of Commons and Rouse of Ltds; but, as it became obvious that it would be carried they thought it right to form some arrangements with the promoters, so as to obtain some powver over it. Lookingatthe Wimnbledcn and Epsom project, torether with the Portsmouth line from Havant to Godalming, and another line also sanotioned from Leatherbead to Epsom, and considering that the line might be worked inimically to the company, the board entered into an agreement with thepromoters togetthecontrol ofthe Wimbledon and Epsom line. They also saw that the line could not be worked afely as a single line, especially at certai,i periods of the when the trafEic would be heavy; they therefore stipu?ated that it should be a double lino, and, as this would involve more expense than was contemplated by the pro. rmoters, they agreed, on tbe part of the South-Western Company, tosubscibe for 1,500 shares in the new company, on condition of having two directors to represent them at the board of the new company, and he hoped the arrangement would meettheirapproval. Their locomotive superintendent had reported their rolling stock and permanent way as being in good working order. He wonld be h ppy to answor any questions, and conduded by moving the adoption of the Ar. J. TIEOBALD seconded the motion, Mlr. EzRAPATH was extremely sorry to we that the board were about to entertain a project for making a line from Wimbledon to E1nsom. He held a much large. amount of stock In the South-Western than he did in the Brighton Company, *nd Be feared that by encouroging that new line e7 6'Twe opening tie door to a great deal of disoord, He 'isbed to know how tbe line to PAtqrhh rwld d fect The 0RAMT stAted they bidl Zetworth trafflo now brought on their lineat Godslmirng. Mr. H A.TAI said there was nothing more njuzio6s to railway companies tbhn cozupetin schemes, He blievod the Brighton Company considered tbat the South-Webterri had interfered with their distriat by going to Epsora. He boped the sbareholders would oppo4e zmeaures oft tb4tkind, for in 19 ctses ont of 20 those schemes 'were promoted for irofessional perpowes by contractors and engineers, (Hear, Vr. Trry, MY,, said he was old enough to ramembe hot' tthe South.Western Company lost the line to Epoom. It was in consequence of the atmonspberic scheme being promroted by the Brighton or Croydop parties, thebr ia opnot3tion to them, tbat they managed to defeat the BUZ for a liie from Wimibledora to Epsom; but the failore of the atmospberic scheme put an end to all the sopposed advantages thepublto were to derive frnm it. Ie greed with Mr Herapath that an end should bo put to strife between comnpanies, and trated that the good sense of railway oomponies would preval, that they would rest on' their oars, and avoi all attemris at inva3ion. He wii quLite sure the cosmpany had no chsoietin the matter of the Epsom line' they had no alternative but to make the best co it. He fid no doubt the Lne would pay. Witb regard to the dividend, be was perfectly xatisfied that the gradual increase of the traffic would soon bring it up to the point it attained let year. The report ws then unanimously adopted, and a dividend at the rate of 4i per cent per annam was declared for the ptst half-3ear, payable on the 20th inst, The solicitor then read tbe beads of agreements with the Salisbury and Yeovil Railway Company; with the Loundon and Brl hton and Wimbledon and Croydon Railway.Com. panies, for the joint leasing and working of the latter linealso, with the Slisbury and Maket-house Rlilway CoeiW pany. Besolutions approving these agreements were unanimoudy adopted. Anagreement to lease the Wimbledon and&peom line, and to subscribe for *nd hold not exoeeding 2,000 shares in the company, was adopted. On tbe motion of Sr. dossrTlRg, it was agreed to set aside 2,4001 a-year tovvards a dieo insrance fund, the former amount being only 1,2001. a-year, which waa not sufi- The prooeedings concluded with a 'ote of thanks to the chairman and directors. PORTSIKOUTIL The half-yearly meeting of this corpany was held yesterday at the office, Great George-street, Westminster; Mr. W-. Jackson, 3LP., in the chair. The report sated that the works may be finished so as to admit of the npein of the line mext spring. The directorg have made arrangements for the issue of so much of the 133,0001. debenture capital of the company as will be necessary to secure the opening of the line by the period mentioned, and also to provide, In case of need, suffioient plant to work the traffic thereon. En addition to the above the oompany has power to rTase 50,0001. upon 5 per cent. preference shares, and the directors have made arrangements for the immediate issue of those shares, with the condition anexed that the company shall have the option of redeemiag them at par at any time w'itbin two years from the 1st of July, 1857. Tho result of the above arrangements will enable the directors to postpone caling up the 21. per share remaining unpaid. By an agreement with the London and South-Western Railway Company the Portsmouth Company is to abandon its Shalford line, exOepting the halfmile cuve nomcssary to connect the South-Western Godalming branch with the South-Eastern line at Shalford. The South-Western Company is to allow this company's traffia to be worked over their Godalming branch to and from the South-Eastern ie at Sh Aord, as well as to and from the Guild ford station. This company is to pay the SoatkWestern Company b0 per cont. of its mileage rates for the above use, and may commute at 1,0001. a-year the rates payable in respect of its traffio to and from Shalford. This company and the South-Western Company are to have the right of using each other's Godabming stations, and the intervening portion of each other's lines, free of charge, except, the proportion of the station expenses due to the traffic of each. The capital account showed that 269,9781. had been received, and 262,3411 expended, leaving a balance of 7,6371. On the motion for the adoption of the report a long discussion ensued, which resulted in its adoption. The retiring directors were re-elected. The maeeting was then made speclal, and the directors were authorized to issue 2,600 shares of 201. each, to be entitled to a preference dividend of 5 per cent, per annum. A vote of thanks to the chairman conrcluded the proceedings, STOCKTO1N AND DARLINGTON. The directors of this company sate in their report that tbe receipts on revenue account for the half year ending the 30th of June last amounted to 175,6161. and the expenditure, taxes, &c. to 93,362&. The interest on ians amounted to 9,921l, leaving the available b3aance 72,3321. Brom this was deducted 2,60 forimprovementsand alterations on the line, leaving 69,832b, whicb, after providing for preference charges and rentals, would admit of a dlvi end a the rate of 10 per cent, per nnum on the ordinary shares, leavinrg 2,000A to be carried foiward. The total length of line worked by this companyis 16A rciles, the cost 2,500,0001., averagiDg 21,5001. per mile. The South Durham and vancashire UJnion lRailway Comnpany's Bifl received the Royal assent on the 13th of July for making a raillway from Barnard Cast3e to Tebay- and it is intended by the Stockton and Darlingion to wont: the line for them. OSWESTIIY AND NEWTOWN. The first sod of this undertaking was out on Tuesday, in afield near Welshpool, in presence of uvpwards of 10,000 persons, by Lady Wynn, wife df Sir Watkin W.
