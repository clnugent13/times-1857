AMFlRICA. (BY YLECrfsoM AND flIkRiATIONAL TZrGR"Af.) LIVBRPOO4 FRIDAY NIGHT. The Royal Mail steamship Persia, Captain Judkdns, has arrived, with advices from New York to the 8th inst. She hia brought $881,885 specie on freight. The Persia on this cocasion has made the quicke t passage on record between New York and Liverpoo. She started from the former port at 8 20 am. on the 8th of July, and arrived in the Mersey at 4 20 p.m. on the 17th, the time occupied, after deducting difference of, time and two hours detention off the Liverpool bar of Water, being exactly 9 days 1 hour 15 minutea. During the last five days she ran 1,689 miles, averaging more than 1.4 miles per hour. On the 8th inst. the Persia exchanged signals with the Pomona, hence, and. on the 16th pssed the screw steamship Kangaroo, hence for Newr York. TheUnited States'mail steamshipEricsson,C4ptain Lowther, has also arrived. Sheleft New York on the 4thinst.; she ba brought $50,000specie onfreight. On the 11th inst., in lat. 49 51 N., long. 3919 ,W the Ericsson exchanged signals with the. ship Advance, of Glazgow, bound east; and on the. 13th, in lat. 51 15 N., long. 28 42, passed the brig Annie Laurie, bound west; the United States' mail steamship Columbia, hence, and the screw steaiship Lebanou from Havre. At New York- on the 5th inst. the Hon. W. L. Marcy, ex-United Statese Secretary, had been found dead in his bed. He complained of feeling unwell during tholmorning, but went to his room about 12. isage was 71. The bark Panchita, Captain Solavers, alleaed to be a slaver, and seized as such in the River Congo at Forto de Lenha (coast of Africa), by the Britih brig Sappho, Captain Moresby, Mayi 9th last, arrived. - on the 6th in charge of the First Lieutenant, as captain, Lieutenant Ireland, and 12 men. A rumour from St. Louix states that troops and 60 teamsters had been slain bv the Indians. The Washington correspondent of the New York Zribune states, that Lord Napier had cormunicated to Secretary Cass a disavowal of the ceesion to England of the island in Panama Bay; that he aleo denied the alegation that the Chincha Islands had been- conveyed to British subects, or had been placed under a British and Frenchi protectorate; andthathe furthermore disclaimed generaUy the policy of territorial acquisitions in or near the American continent; but admitted that Her Britannic Majesty's Government would oppose the maonopoly by any Power of the rights and privileges, commercial or otherwise, rightfully appertaining to the general interests of the world. Her Majesty's steamer Cyclops sailed from St. John's, Newfoundland, on the 6th, for England. Navigation had been opened between Lake Erie and the G'xreat Hy draulic Canal at Niagara Falls. The Washington correspondent of the New York Heral(d states that Lord Napier had informed the United States' Government of the settlement by New Granada of the Maokintosh claim held by English subjects. Some fatal rowdy riots had occurred in New York -eight lives were lost. According to the New York !Vrilvne negotiations were tending to the eettlement of Nicaragua, againon the basis of the Webster and Frampton project of 1852, allowing Costa Rica the free use of the San Juan :River to a certain extent. Mr. Reid, the United States' Envoy to China, had sailed in the Minnesota. The New York Tourcndl of Commerce states he was to be invited to reside with Lord Elgin at the Governor's house at Hongkong. Lord Napier had engaged a summer residence at Frostburgh, near Cunberland, Maryland. Two destructive fires had occurred in CinCinnati Advice froma Northern Mexico atate that troops had been ordered to Tamaulipas to prevent apprehended disturbances. Advices from the Havannah to the 3d report that the newly arrived troops had been distributed through the Island. Accounts from Port-au-Prince report the destrue tion of nearly the whole business portion of the city by fire. At New York, since the 2d inst., the railway stock-market bad exhibited an upward tendency; tho advance in prices was rapid; in some instances an advance of several per cent. was obtained, The- favourable change in the aspect of the market was attributable in a great measure to the continuance of an easy st3te of money matters since thelit inst. when a greater or less degree of stringency was expected by many, and to the more cheering financial advices from Loidon and Paris, These encouraging features in connexion with a dowvnward tendency in thq rates of foreign exchange, and consequent material reduction in the weekly exports. of specie, had led to large purchasea of stocks. The supply of actual stock upon the market was comparatively limited, while the demand from day to day to meet maturing contracts was quite large. Thelarge increase of specie, as shown by the B3ank reports published, had increased the buoyaucy of the market, and the advance on the 7th was greater than on any previous day. In City and State bonds business continued limited. Prices generally were without change, but in some instances there was a light decline. Pittsburgh Sixes, in consequence of the non-payment of the interest on some of the bonds issued to railroad companies, were offered at low prices, without buyers. The Supreme Court of the State of New York had decided that the bonds of the City of Rochester, issued to the Tennessee ValUey Railroad, the payment of interest on which was some time since restrained by an injunction, were constitutional, and that the injunction ought to be removed. Of railroad bonds the sale had been limited, and the course of prices irregular. Illinois Central bonds were scarce, and had an upward tendency. State stocks were generally inactive, and rather heavy. The only important transaction during the fortnight had been in Missouri Sixes at 82g. California Sevens, in consequence of non-payment of the interest due on the 1st inst., had declined with small sales from 61 to 55. There had been a decline of one and a-half per cent. in Missouris, and one per cent. in Tenessees and Virginias, and an ad-vance of one per cent. in Ohio Sixes and Indiana Fives. The demand for money had been rather more active, but not in excess of the supply, and rates of interest continued without material change. For the last three days the supply exceeded the demand, at 7 per cent. for loans on caU and 8 to 9 for discount of first-class paper. Since the Ist the payment of duties had increased materially, but the disbursements by the sub-treasury were still largely in excess of receipts. Foreign exchanges continued dull and heavy; on London, 109i to 109i. The cotton-market had continued to improve, and the rise in prices since the 29th ult. was about $L to id., at whichit was difficult to purchase even inferior qualities. The business had been chiefly for the Continent. According to Wright's circular the crop is fully three weeks later than the average, but with genial weather and a late frost an average crop may be ex- pected. The receipts of flour were light, and all descriptions were held with more confidence. Buyers were unwilling to give the quotations; for State four, 0M 35c. were obtained; Southern, $7 75c. Sugar was steady. Tobacco and iron unchanged. Provisions uncbanged. Freights very languid. At New Orleane, on the 6th, prices of cotton were stiffer, but not quotably higher.

IHER MAJESTB S VISIT TO ALDBBSROTT. The field-day which took place here yesterday in tho pre. renoe of Her Majesty was one of the most brilliant which hi, occurred for some time past, It was not a mere review, but a grand sham battle, where the strengta of the opposing forces wa balanced with such scrupulous impartiality that the claim to viotory on either side was doubtful even at the Ve27 end. There was a great influx of visiton from town to witne6s the evolutions, and, of course, a proportionate drain upon the vehicular accommodation of Farmborough. Cobs, horses, ffies, in short overwthing that w6uld go upon wheels and very many that, asit turned out eventually, would not, were In demand, and at a time when suburban London only resounds to the cries of sweeps and milkmen theroad to the camp was thronged. A large number of general and field offioers in uniform came down from London, as did also the Duke de Montpensaerand another member of the late Royal Family of France. Before 9 o'clock all the hills near the South Camp, and overlooking the long valley, were quite. aovered with carriages, equestrians, and pedestrians of all ranks. The troops paraded at 8 o'clock, and moved at once to their respective positions. A slight alteration, but a great irprovement, was made In one part of the programme which we gave in T7he Times of yesterday. Instead of an imaginary foe holding Pystock ridge, and being attacked by the troops in two divisiong, Her Majesty decided that one divilon of the forces should hold the ridge while the 6ther attacked and dislodged them. Beyond this great imptovemeMt, which enabled every civilian on the ground to appreciate the force and purpose of each mianceuvre, the prescribed general order of'the evolutions was strictly adhered to. Hler Majesty left the Pavilion anci remelhed thi valley a little before 10., The Prince Consort, in the uniform of Colonel of the Rifle Brigade, rode by the side of Her MajesWy carriage, with P nce Alfred, wlho was also mountedK Altoyal salute announced the arival of Her Madesty, and the evolutions lmmediately commenced, The " enemy," under the command Of General Spencer, heldthe whole extent of Pystook ridge south of the Basing. stoke Canl Their strength comprised a troop of Horse Artillery, two field-batterits, the Ist Dragoon Guards, the 7th aud 15th Hussars, the 3d battalion of the RifleBrigade, the 15th, 20th, 96th, and 97th Regiments, with a party of the maflitary train and ambulance waggons-in fct,: an arry very small, but complete for service in all its branches. The assallants were under the command of LordWilliam Paulet, and mustered the 4th Light Dragoons, 6th lnnis. killens, one troop of Horse Artillery, one field battery, the lIt battalion of Coldstream Guards, the 1st battalion of the Rifle Brigade, the 54th, 66th, and 22d Regiments, with three companies of the Engineers, and a pontoon train. The assailants moved rapidly from Elmore Farm, and' advanced upon the canal across the open ground in. columns of companies, with skirmishers in advanbe-Cavalry and Horse Artillery upon the flanks. The enemy opened a desultory cannonade at long range, from Pygtock heights, and after a few raanoauvres Lord Paulet detached his Horse Artillery and Light Dragoons to advance by an 'old road, cross the canal at a bridge about a mile above the enemy, and, debouching upon the plain, threaten their extreme left. In the meanwhile he advanced leisurely, and without opposition, towards the canal at the foot of the heights, 'which formed the centre and was the key of the enemy's position. During this time the manceuvres were excessively tame; for, in order to bring the troops into good view of Her Majesty, the evolntions were hurried over, and the strategy and precautions of warfare utterly disregarded. The assailants moved in open order along the borders of,a thick wood, which assuredly would have been their ruin had the enemy been animated by any other than the most friendly disposition. As they advanced, Pystock. ridge, a tremendous position, which might have been held against a world in arms, was hastily abandoned by the enemy, leaving only a few gums to dispute the passage of the canaL These, however, were of no avaiL After more than half-an-hour's delay, and with an amount of tinkering sufficient to build a house, a pontoon bridge was constructed. This operation lasted so long, that aone of the troops would have got across at all but that tho pact of the canal chosen for pontooning was judiciously selected about a hundred yards distant from two permanent bridges, one on either side. On these the troops crossed, and the -pontoon. raft was only constructed in time to bring over those who had made it. The Prince Consort and the French Princes came to soo the raft put together, but were tired out, and left before it was half corapleted. On arriving at the other side of the canal the assailants pushed up the ridges vigorously, and, tho enemy having lost their only point of strength without a blow, at last came to thq tardy resolution of fighting it out manfully. Their troops rapidly maneuvred, cavalry advanced to the front, atd as the attaoking Rifles moved* up the hill a sound like very distant thunder, but too well known in war, was plsixly audible. A dense cloud of dust appeared on the hill, from out of which the gleam of sabres and yellow lustre of the helmets dimly shone. Loud shouted orders and the clang of trumpets resounded through the field, and in another minute the enemy's Dragoons were charging, Down they came-a torrent of horses, with a rush that made the speotators' blood run. cold to witness. The Rifles and infantry that I bad crossed the canal threw themselves into solid lquares,. and met the charge with heavy volleys of znusketry, while the supporting troops-infantry, field batteries, and cavalry-were hastened up the slopes at double time. As the Dragoons feU back the Light Cavalry and guns de. tached by Lord Paulet made their appearance, and threatened the enemy's left, bht in an instant General Spencer dashed at them with his Light Cavalry. This was a grand movement. The impetus with which the 7th and 15th Hussaars swept up a narrow vaUey between the ridges, with the troops of Horse Artillerythundering on their flank, was striking and terrible.. The scene now becama most exciting. The attacking batteries and cavalry came atreaming up the heights like a flood of brilliant metal. Gaus were hurried forward over every obstacle, and esch as it got into position opened fire, till 30 pieces of-ordnance were in full play. The field became covered with smoke, through which the masses of the enemy's troops could be seen retreating under cover of their cavalry, which wheeled and hovered ia their rear, whle the shout of orders, staff officers hurryingfromregimentto regiment, the incessant roll of musketry, and general hurry and confusion which seemed to prevail, gave to the whole evolution the aspect of a determined battle, an impression which was heightened by the appearance of a riderless horse every now and then galloping wildly about the plain. At length, after a terrific cannonade, the enemy's infantry fell back rapidly, their cavalry remaining with the Horso ArtiUery to check pursuit. This, however, they were unable to do, though they tried hard for it. The assailaunts gradually pressed upon them, and, preceded by their cavalry, and occupying the heights on either side of the long valley with their guns, drove their antagonists slowly before them. Twice the latter swept the plain with cavalry, -who charged up to the very bayonets of the squarcs which the Guards, Rifles, 54th, 22d, and'66thRegiments formedto receive them; but It had been pre-arranged that here at least they were to be repeUed, so gallantry was unavailing, and only shed atran. slent lustre over their defeat. Once the Enniskillens and Dragoou Guards charged each other-a movement very rarely ventured on, as the horses at least, if not the men, are Rpt to become so exdted that the evolution is by no means without danger to both. They dashed at each other with all the speed and apparent fury of real warfare, and seemed about to solve the old schoolboy question as to the result of a mneeting bet ween an Immovable and an irresistible body. Their horses wero only pulled up as the heads of the foremost lines were touching each other. The enemy then fell back, fighting step by step, until they ocCUpied the steep and lofty eminence called C.esa's Camp, where they made a final stand. The battle then became one of infantry and artillery. The enemy held the craggy ridges of the hill with their infantry in contiguous lines, cavalry and artiUery on the flanks. Almost in ! the same order on the part of the assailants the attack was made. The file fire and cannonade on both sides was' something fearful to listen to. General Marmont, Wellington's old foe, ued to say " that of all European troops there were none which delivered such a steady, deadly fire as the British," and one could appreciate yesterday the 'full trath of the remark as a fusilade ran up and down the line that seemed as if it must have swept away the enemy, Caesar's Camp, and all. The hill became completely wrapped in smoke, amid which the broad flashes of the artillery and red uniforms of the men could be dimly and faintly seen as in a dream, and the whole of this portion of the evolutions bore an unpleasant resemblance to the hot thirsty day when, under just such a murderous fire, the English moved up to attack somewhat similar heights at Alma. After the firing had continued some time the enemy again advaneed their cavalry, but, instead of charging the Ennskillens, chose a wtaker foe, and swept up the hill, on which some hundreds of the publio were posted in fancied Eecurity. Of course there was a general scamper, and every one fell back pell-mell till they reached the carriages, and could retreat no further, when they turned and faced the fearful array of horsemen with the courage of despair. None, however, showed m6re coolness under these trying circumstances than the ladies, who stood still and met the charge with that passive resistance which is their strength, and to overcome which all Aldershott would be as nought Before these the cavalry, of course, pulled up, though not till they had impressed many individnals with the notion 4hat they were about to be given cve a j yB and a .p4i! to thq sar of a Sifuriated soldiety. The uillens, who sh6uad have flown to the reliet of the pubWo and repulsed the enemy, looked tamely on the while, but tAtlbuttve justice soon overtookthem, for the very next charge they attempted wsu thrown into disorder amd rendered ibortive by a donkey.cart As they crasn down In line every one rushed out -of their way, except an unfortunate coster' monger, who, with a very little donkey between theshbate of a verY large cart, waa hawldng about a cloudy peverage, not unlike warm soap and water, under the name of nectar. Every one. shouted to tho man,, who with a short atiek"remonstrated". with the donkey freely, but all in vain; the animal coald as soon have crossea the Equator as gone.out. of reach of the wide-spread linea of cavalry. Offioers called aid polioemen threatened, but "all the King's horses and al the Xing's men" failed'to iove the obstinate brte out of the middle of the little valley in which he stood. So the mountain made rooui for Mahohet, and the charge was halted. Animated by this ignominloun check he enemy issued down the bllls in force and seemed about 4o, retrieve the fortuneo of the day, when the signal was given and the. contest ceased, after l&iting. all but three hours. All. the troops then, returned to 'the Long Valey, and the oeremony of marching past the Queen concluded the mahoeuvres of the day. nothersha4nbttle on anequslly animated and extensive scale wil take place to-day at 10 o'clock precisely. It was expected in camp last evening that Her Majesty would honour the Camup Theatre with her presence to witness the amateur perzor. roance of the offlcers and men. After the review was over there was a great rush to get baok to town. Special tralns, however, were. provided for the vistors, and through the admirable arrangements at the Farnborough station every facility was afforded for this' purpose, and all who wished to do so returne, early to London.

Viscount DUNGA NNO believed their lord1hips wonld ' agree that that E,e, was a proper receptacle for works of arft portraylng hITtorical. events of the highest' public interest; and it appeared to him that a inore 'appropriate. place' thaa one of the apartments attached to that buding' could not be'fopnd,for a painting of the coronation of Her Most Gracious Majesty QueenrVictoria. Theociginalpicture. of tat splendid subject, by Sir G. Hayter, was now for sale; I and wheprtbey telnembered that many of the illustrious' men 'who took,part in that State ceremonial had sincO been removed from andong uq this great work of art became one' of additional historical interest. boreover, the new palace of'Weatminster having beea erected in the reignof the present Sovereign, it was onlyfitting that a tpictorialrepresentation ofthecoronation of H,erMaesty should adorn its walls. He wished teo sk h'e President of the CouncU whether it was in contemplation to purcbaso for the House of Lords t .e,origal painting of the Coronation by Sir G. Earl GRANTV l.E said, that' the Gnvermnent had nothing to do with the decorations of the Howses of Parliament, which were referred to a Royal Coruuis.i on, of which the Prince Consort was President, an'd to which several dic-' tinguished mem,bers of both Houses belonged. Ile was not one of those Commissioners, and he could not therefore give the noble viscount any information. At the Pameetitne, he thought it undesirable that the Coudsuissioners should be called upon to explain the reasons why they did not purchase any particular pictures' that might happen to be in the market. (Hear.) * Lord EDBSDALE 3wished to renew the protest he had before maade against being kept out of the use of a room (the robing-room, as we understood). In tbe preseat session the inconvenienco sustained was comparatively smoall, because there wasbut a smasl amount of contested business, but the room in wiich he was obliged to carry on the private business was very an4ll and. unpleasantly crowded. He understood that the room in question was in the hands of' the. painter, who said ho could noS promiise that' it. would be ready for,Swo or three years to come. He had no objecti6n to the decoration;of the Houses of Parliament, but he thought th con.veuence of their lordahips ought to be in' soume measure consulted. The Marquis of CLAANRICARDE: could .confirm the re -.I presentations of the- noble lord as to the inconvenience sustainedfrom,the committee rooms being closed to their lordships,while the decorations were going on. Lotd DUNGANON had not been'saware to wl'n his' applicati,on.onghttobesussie;but he could' not:hat regret. taat there s{eemneI so little chasnce'of securing the picture for the ~trnss of 'Parliaduent.. : t V,1IE lV ' TEE . t tCAN' SL&VE; ... .

'It rather belonged to that eass of ' questions of which Mr. Canning onee said, 4 "VitiL questions,i as they are called, ArS those question, which 'tobody cares twv stravs abgut.1 ' o could not say, however, that the, present question 'cime within that category, for there was both In Parliament sld out of it avery strong feeling as qell as a deeply rooted conviction of! the importance of the subject which he should;now pro. coed shortly to bring before their lordships. It Was with very great pain snd no little astonishmet.t that he first heard of the measures lately adopted in France. le felt' perfectly assured that the Sovereign of that co1gntry was wholly incapable of lending his countenance to any me4-' sures tht tended to revive the African slave trade. Ho said so in the first place oq account of his family connexion with him who first in 'France abolished that. rxecrable traffic. The "Most Christian Kings" had, one aftanother, allowed that traffic to continue and even to 'lonrish, and had, indeed, aU the while oncouraged iustead of suppressing it. It was reserved forthe First lapoleon to do that act of his life which reflected the most honour upon'hidn-,ho would say, indeed, the only act of his life in which hehowece himself the frlend of human rights and humu Iibertie t ' was reserved for him at once and for ever to abolish the African. slave trade. He could not, therefore, believe that he who 80 naturally prided himself upon his near relationship to that great and distinguished individual would take a different coure, and lend his countenance to measures, with respect to which he had probably been ill-advised, deceived, and misled. The Emperor of the French, no doabt, believed that the project in question had none of thattendeucy tothe revival of the slave trade which he thought he could proye to their 'lbrdahips, without doubt or question, it possessed. Hi. could not believe it. possible that His Imperial Ma- jesty had been otherwise than misled, misinformed,' and deceived. When he considered those by whoom HIs Imperial Majesty was surrounded, and to v?homr he had given in ecclesiastical matters so much of his confidencenamely, thoso ministers of rdeigion to whose policy his Imperial Majesty seemed inclinedto lean, he felt certain that they must have told him of the soffences comuiitted'byslavetraders being ranged intheodenunciations of Holy Writ with tho most hateful and disgusting crimes of which man could be guilty; crimes to which he dared not even allude except to say that they were not worse than the slave trade. When this was well representedc to his Imperial Majesty, and especialy when,hefound that their lordshipsand tbat theGo. vernment of this country viewed with great suspicion all that was now doing or attempting to be done, he hoped that His Majesty wotuld vlewthese transactions with the same jealous suspicion of their possible consequences, and that he would be thus furnished, with a sufficient answer to the imuorteuni ties of his colonial subjects, to which for the presents and under a misapprehension of tho facts and consequences, ho seemed to have given way. Without farther preface, he would proceed to.state how it was that licenses had been given to. certain nercantile adventrers, or to certain aents, as it had even ceen, said, of. the French Government, to import a limited nuruber of freo cegroes into the French West Indian colonies. Nowr, such a scheIe as that must end In a renewal of the internal African slaveotrade. From the representations which had been made to him by a learned friend of his, 3r. Fitzpatrick, who filled the important office of judicial assessor on the Gold Coast for a period of six wears, and who-was thoroughly acquainted with the Messrs. Regis, of Marseilles, as well as their representatives upon the Gold Coast, he had ascertained ihat l those gentlemen were most respectable merchants-,o that in theinformation which he had received in refere;cco to them from Mr. Fitzpatrick;: prejudice againstthem eouldnotbosaid tohave asbare. What, then' was the' proposition whioh, according to Mr. Fitzpatrick, was made uponr the part of those gentlenien ' Why, that the Africans, beingslaves in theirown catnnry, should bein. duced to emigrate to the West Indies; that care should be taken that the contracts which .might be entered into with them should be faithfuUy observed; that they shobld have the security of the Governmeist officers for their .proper treatment on the voyage to the West Indies - that upon their arival in that quarter they should have governuent security' for the exercise of kindness towards them upon the part of tho masterg to *whom they were to be bound'apprentices by indenture; and that if they at any time desired to return to their native country, they should be allowed to do so, a should be conveyed bac4 at the charge of those by whonm they ad beon token to a foreign iad.

JHe cited the authority of 3r. Fitzpatrick, and would read a letter from him, which more than conSrmed the opinion3 which he had expressed. That gentleman said:- "The Africans ate not a migratory people. If they were free to-morrow, and capahle of undersanding this contract for' 10- yeast expatriation and servitude," which he (Lord Brougham) need not tell their lordships the poor African cpuld no more camprehend than he could a problem in the higher geometry, *t they would much rather become slaves in their own country than enter into it. 'The Kroomen, though fond of earning money to take back to their-own couttry after a short absence, and though temptea on board ourernisers by payamounting to from $s to $12 per -month, with fUll rations or their money value equal to $7 more per month, and employmentontheelement on which they are at home, will not enter into lengthened service; and to suppose that they would be induced by a promise ef 11fL per month to go to a distant eouhtry for 10 years is zbsurd. The MML Regis, howevtr, prpose to putchas the-slave's freedom on condition of hisat once emigating for loyear' service in the French West Indies, and thus to stablish a system of free emigration. ' It is difficult, I think, to'discover in this plan the jrns m kempo~'iwin whichithe subject of the operation is free.

HOUSE OF COMMIONS, FRmAY, JuLY 17. The SPEAKER took the chair at 12 o'clock. LUINATICS (SCOTLAND) BILL. The House went into committee on this BilL Progress was made up to clause 107. Upon clause 108, Mr. STIRLING complained that a Bill of 109 clauses should be presented without a table of contents. The reading of Bills was not so very inviting that monibers could afford to bestow much time in looking for particular clauses. The LORD-ADVOCATE said he would give instructions on the subject when the Bilj was reprinted. Tho clause was then agreed to. Upon a clause brought up by the Lord-Advocate, empowering the Home Secretary, if uecessary, to appoint two medical persons to be deputy commissioners under the Act, withi salaries of 5000., Mr. BUCHANAN said the intended appointment of those persons was quite unknown to the Scotch members. He thougbt that altogetber the passing of this Bill had been too much hurried. (glear.) There was no unanimity as to the machinery of the measure, but some pressure seemed to have been put upon the Scotch members in respect to legislation on the subject. The LORD-ADVoCA-TE observed that, instead of proceeding too hurriedly, they had been more than ten yeirs employed in the work of leqiislation. (Ilear.) He should have thought that the House had greatly failed in its duty if some attempt had not been made in the present session to remedy the evils at present ex isting in the system. Mr. BLACKBURN thought the House had delayed too lorng and hurried too much at last in legislating upon this subj'ect. (Hear.) Mr. KINNAIRD quite agreed with the Lord-Advocate. The neglect that had taken0place with regard to lunatics had brought reproach upon Sootlallsi, and if something had not been done this year he believed there were members in the Hlouse who would have compell ed legislation in the matter. Mr. SCOTT thought the subject requi-ed early legislation and mature deliberation, whereas there h ad been late legislation and very little consideration. Mr. BUCHANAN explained that he hatl not meant to say that no legislation ought to have taken ph.'ce this year; be onlycontended that the House had beentoo .auchhurried at last. The clause was then agreed to. Several other clauses were brought up and agreed 0o. The House then resumed, when the CrAiRmsAr rey,orbcld progress. BURIAL ACTS AMENDMENT BILL. The Itouse went into committee on this Bil. On clause 16, Mr. CLAY moved the addition of the following proviso. -" 'ht such xegulations shall not invalidate or inter(ere with fny contract or agreement for the burial, in such cemetery or burial-ground as aforesaid, of not more than six 'bodies in the same grave, under the regulations as afore-. sAd as to the depth and closing of the grave entered iut', prior to the 30th of June last past, and whlch shaU b:,ve been approved, prior to the passing of this Act, 15y the Local Board of Health of the district in which suPgf cemetery or burial-ground may be situated." The motion was agreed to. Several new clauses were brought up and agreed to, on the motion of Mr. MASSEY. The House then resumed. At a few minutes before 4 o'olock the sitting was suspended. The House resumed at 6 o'clock. Petitions against the Divorce Bill were presented by Lord J.

NORR1EYS gave notice that on the next sapply night he would call the attention of the House to an order which appeared in the journals of the House of Lords, to the effect that an address be presented to Her Mtajesty praying for the appointment of a commission of inquiry on the subject of a national survey. ("Hear, hear," end laughter,) INiDIA. Sir E. PERRY gave notice that on an early dayj he wvould move that the facts disclosed by recent events in India, the embarrassed state of £ts finances, the maladministration of justice in its provincial courts, and, the Innumerable tics which make our Indian possessions an integral portion of the British Empire render it expedient that the government of that country should be transferred in name, as vell as in I act, from the East India Company to the resnonsible IMinisters of the Crowvn. (HIear.)t HINSTOWN R"AILWAY. MIr. HAM ILTON, in the absence of Colonel Taylor, asked the Vice-President of the Board of Trade whether he had received a memorial from certain persons residinginathe vicinity of the Kfingatowin Railway, and whether it was the Intention of htis department to interfere to oblige the directors of that line of railway to run trains according to Mfr. LOWE said the Board of Trade had received the memorial mentioned. It had been transmitted to the Kin gstown R?ailway Company, and had been in their hands about a week. As an answer had not yet been received, of course it would be premature to state what steps the Board of Trade would take, but of course they would take care that the Act was observed. IRISH REVENUE POIdCE. Mr. HOa AILTON, also on the part of Colonel Taylor asked the Chief Secretary for Ireland whether it was intended to amalgamate the revenue e ole with the constabne lary; and, if so, whether provision would be made to secare to the offbcers of the former service their status and prooressive rank andfemoluments. Mr. WILSON said the hon, gentleman was probably aw are that three years ago a Bill was passed, by which the constabulary force in Ireland was permittod to assist the revenue police with the view of stopping illicit distillation. That measure had onerated so well that on the renewal of the Bll in the present year it was proeased to take powners for the further extension of the principle then adopted, and perhaps of ultimately entirely aaalgamating the two forces. Of course, in that case, a nust and fair provision would hc made for whatever officers or the revenue police might not be absorbed iathe Constabulary. JEWISH DISABILITrE3 Mer. DIILWYN stated that at the request oE a larg number of gentlemen with whom he acted he had agreed to postpone his motion with respect to the oath of abjura tion for the present. (Hear, hear.) Lard BUrGELEY.-I wish to know whether it is tru, that the Bath Eledtion Committee was adjourned yesterday for the specal purpose of enablig the chairman (Mr. Haors man) to attend the meeting respecting the Jewvish D;s. abilities. Mr. HOR&SMTAN.-The question of the noble lord implie more than can be answered by a mere affirmative or noga tive; for it implies that, as chairman of the Bath Election Committee, I did, on my own motion, without notice, take onimyselftoadjorn the committee, te the great inon venience and expense of the parties before it, for the avowed purpose of enabling me to attend the meeting in question The noble lord, then, will be glad to learn that I did not pursue any course so unusual and so improper, and if I had attempted it, the other members of the committee were gena tlemen who knew their duty too well to permit it. I will stat what occurred. It was on the Wsedaesday morning that I knew that this meeting vas likely to take place, ad an the assembLing of the committe I conversed with two of the members, and we discussed the probability of being able to attend it. In the course of that day's proceedings I stated that if an adjournment could take place next day w,ithout inconvenience possibly such a thing migh' be suggested. To that intimation I received that courteous answer which gentlemen, members of the same committee, were likely to give to one another; but .e all felt the matter depended oa the convenienco of the parties beforel the committee. I then asked the coonsel if, in the event of the state of business permitting it, a proposition should be made to adjourn the committee next day at 2 o'clock any inconvenience would result. The counsel aia both sides stated that, so far from such a step being felt as an inconvenience, it was the course they would both desire to bh taken. I begged them to be assured that the committee sat there for no other purpose than to consult the convenience of the parties before it, and that unless it suited their convenience and duty there would be no suggestion for an adjournment. They replied that they would themselves have proposed that course, and that they had no objection to it. I then stated that after that expression of opinion, and as it appeared that counsel, candidate, and agents were all of one accord in stating that they preferred the course I suggested, I would propose an adjournment next day at 2 o'clock. Nothing was said to the effect that the object of the ad. journment was to enable any one to attend the meeting on the Jewish disabilities; no qnestion wan asked, and the suggestion I made to the counsel and agents was received, not only with ready concurrence, but with alacrity. Thus 24 hours' notice was given of the adjournment, and ant one shilling of additional expense was caused by it. The adjournment having been agreed to, I certainly did attend the meeting in question, whick was a most interesting meetin,g, and if the noble ied had been present he would have been in a pesitioR to acknowledge its important character. (" Hear/' and a laugh.) Lord GALWAY (a member of ti,o committee) rose to address the House, and, to put himself in order moved that "the House on its rising do adiourndAil Monday." lie said when the chairman of the committee stated that lie could not sit longer than 2 o'clock on Thursdar- not the slightest intimation was given that he was going to attend the meeting on the Jewish disabilities EHad I beea aware of the reaqon I, for one, would have drvvided the committee on the subject. (Hear, hear.) I think it is a very unfair practice, particularly in repect to elecition committeea, the parties attending which are put to great expense, 'o lose two hours; and in this case it does so happen that we h. vae this day concluded the business exactly in two oturs, anx might therefore have concluded - it on 'Ihursday.a lge rh ear.) Wzth respe.t to the opuDnni I .?*j tbink the sumn now asked for would be nw-clont? for ffi~ ptirposes for wich it was intended. (Head.) The CHANCEILLOP. of the EXCHEEQUM sit* d notlap,ear to him that there was any inacuraoy iiL thur rtr aeby the East India Company. No doubt ther estimate was fonnded upon the arrangemenlt moo in,ttr beginng of the year, that the hum to be repaid to tise Eait :ndia ornpany on account of the Persian expedition should be 290.5000. Since that time an arrangement had been made to repay the East India Company 500,0WI., and that would have been all that the Government would have called upon Parliameent to pay if it hadnot been for recent occurrences in India. Those events had altered the financial position of the East India Company, urnd hid made it desirable that the Government should lay upon the table a suspplementary estimate on this subject. The discrepancy towhich the right hon. gentlemat had alluded way merely evidence of a change of intention. Sir E. PERRY asid that the independence of Herat was the cause of the Affghan war, and which coet the country 20,000,001. inflictd upen us much disaster and disgrace. fhe Persian war of 7856 waefootnded upon the same policy but, although the Government upheld this viev, he did not believe that it was a sound policy to pursue, or that te, opinion of the Governrment had been entertained by the greatest Indian statesmen. Herathad been caled the gate of India, but it was many hunldred mniles from our frontier, and it was ssparated fromx our territory by the Bolan and Xhyber passe, the militarr strengtb and importance of whith we knew too welL If the House were to auppose> that we could maintain, an independent Government or an independent chief at Herat, tbey would be giving way toaddhisi6 Thata ity was nowr occupied b~y Persia, and if the report 'worecorrect the Shah had applied for a reinforeement of British. soldiers, in order to aid him in turning out his own troops, (A laugh4 LaI bis opinion, the policy which ought to adopted towardsg Persia by this country had been admirably shadowed fortlr. bLrs bgtCowley to Ferib Khan, when he had atated that wre desired to seo Persia strong, f~surishing, andtt independent.

If it were true that the Sadr Azim were the Lord 7almer. stan of Persia (a laugh), then his authority should aot be, weakened, and we should not be ever solictons to- plunge into a war to uphold the independence in the. insignificant town olfHehrastofan Affghan cut-throat. ("Hear, hear," Sir J. OGILVY expressed his satisfaction at the circumstance that the Treasury of this country was about tobear some portion of the expense connected with the prosecution of the Persian war, inasmuch as some secu-rty would thereby be afforded against embarking in contests which in reality did not tend to the promotion of British Interests. As to the occupation of Herat by Persia, he could only say tbat, in his opinion, that city was too far removedfrmlndind. to give rise to any well-founded apprehension in reference to the safety of our possessions in the East. It was, how evcr, but natural that considerable jealousy should prevail in this country upon that point, inasmuch as no sooner had Herat become subject to Persia than Hussia would by treaty posse6s a right to hare an agent there, and would thus be afforded an opportunity of carrying out tbose designs against Indi! which she was suppose to entertain. But while we looked withsuspicion upon RnsBia, wby was it that our policy tended to break down every barrier between that country and India? We bad byour conductinAffghanistanearnedforourselves the hatred and detestation of the wild tribes by which that region was Inhabited. (Hear, hear.) We had done our utmost, too, to destroy the military power of Persia, and to lay her prostrate at the feet of Rus. sian aggression. (Hear, hear.) The course which we bad in those respects pursued he could not help regarding as unfortunate. He was strongly of opinion that we should have acted more wisely if, instead of weakening, we had strengthened the resources of the Persian empire, and if wo had not exhibited that extreme jealous with respect to the occupation of a position of so much importance to her as Berat which we had displayed. But, to pass from the con. sideration of our relations with Persia tothe position of India, he felt bound to say [that in the sangUine expecta. tioras which the right hon. gentleman the Chancellor of the E.xchequer seemed toentertainwithrespcot tothe state ofthat empire he for one could byno meansparticipate. Theintelli. getce which had lately been received fron that country had fled him with anxiety, and he feared that even the fall of Delhi, of which we mightexpecttohearbythenextmail,would not be sunicient to justify the hope that the mutiny among tbe native troops had been completely extinguished. It had spread much too far to be so easily put down. It ex. tended to the whole of Central India; and, with that fact before them, bearing in mind, too, the season of thelyear and the circumstance that there was but a mere handful of British troops upon the spot, the utmostwe could reasonably expect WaS that those troops should be able to maintain their ground along the wide range of territory lying between Calcutta and tbe north-western frontier, until the reinforcements came to their aid. Meanwhile, the greatest difficulty would be experienced in the collection of the revenue, in consequence of the want of trustworthy native soldiers; the revenue derived from opium would be greatly diminished, owing to the present unhappy state of affairs ; and, under these circumstances, froma what quarter the Governor-General was to obtain his necessary supplies, unless the Government at home were to come to his assistace, he (Sir J. Ogilvy) could not understand. (Hear, hear.) He trusted, therefore, that HIer Majest's Ministers would be prepared to take that course; and he felt assured that in doing so they would ho manfully supported by that House and by the country. Mr. AYRTON said that the statutes relating to the Government of India expressly set forth the purposes for which the revenues of that country were vested in the East India Company, and made no provision whatever that these revenues should he placed at the disposal of the Government of this country; and he wished, therefore, to ascertain from the right hon. gontleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer by what authority the Government could send out an order to India to apply the revenues of that empire to British purposes in anticipation of a vote of Parliament ? The question was one of great constitutional importance, inasmuch as it involved the consideration of enabsng the Cbancellor to avoid asking Parliament for a grant of maoney by drawing upon resources which it had never been intended by the Legislature to place at his disposal. Sir H. WILLOUGHBY said that the Chancellor of the Exchequer in proposing a vote of 500,0001. for the Persian war had challenged observation upon the important question of the general state of the ways and means of t'nis country, and had stated that he had 2,S00,0001. in hand undisposed of. He (Sir H. Willoughby) reminded the committee, how. ever, that 9,000,0001. of income-tax had fortunately come into receipt this year, but for which the surplus of 2.S00,0001. would have been a deficiency of 6,200,000L WVithrespect to the vote of 500,0001., he thought that the committee were placed in rather a painful position ; because they must not fancy that they were about to vote supplies in the ordinary mTanner-they had not the grace of offering supphes to the Crown-but they had merely to pay a Biil and to ratify an expenditure already incurred. He complained that when the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the spring of this year, had stated that the amount required for this vote would be 265,000!., he must have known that a nmuch larger estimate had been prepared, but that he had kept back that e4timate until the last moment. Even now it was only by accident that the committee had hecomo aware that the whole expense would amount to 1,865,0001. ; and he contended that it was not right to treat the comn.ittee in such a muanner when solarge an item of expendlture was involved. (Elear.) Good faith, however, must be kept, and hefelt that hehad nothingto do non the present ocasion but to supportthevote for the600,09i. Inconclusion he wished to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer from what source it was proposed to pay the armaments which were about to be sent to India. Was there to be an additional estimate for the expense of sending 10,000 or l100v men to India; wvas a debt to be incurred, or how was it to be provided for! The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER.-I will first answer the question of the hon. member for the Tower Hamlets, which be seemed to think was a very formidable one, but which I believe admits of a very simple answer. (Bear, hear.) The hon. member asked by what authority the Englssh Government proposed a charge upon the Indian revenue, and he said that the statutes in force did not givethem the power of makling any such demand. I apprehend that the course talen is this:-The President of the Board of Control, by the athority vetted ill him by statute, has through the secret comu ittee of the court of directors, the, power of sending out instructions to the Indi3n Governmeat, either to make wvar or for any other purpose. When. he has sent those instructions to the Indiant Government, tbey, by their authority, carry them into effect, and if those instructions involve any expense, then by their authority that expense is incurreL. That, I bslteve, is the. course adopted in this matter, which the consttuton es. bUlished mnany ears ago with respect to Indian afairs, altogether sanctions. (Bear, hear.} In answer to-the hon. haronetthemember for Evesham, I have to state that. according to law the East India Company have to bear the. nhole ex;pense of sending trooAs from this country and of mailtaining them in India. '[here is, however, a question under consideration which is not yet determined, and that. is wFhether it would be equitable with regard to those troope. whose desdisation was originally China, but which have noDv been diverted to India, that the wholo epensa should fa.ll on the East hndia C ompany 9 Mr. GLADS ION E.-My right hon. friend in tho state. ment which he addressed to the comnmittee did not confino himself t the particular vote which we e Called u po n tcO givo or to withhold this even ing; but he added to his remarksT upon the Persian vote other particulars with respect to the China vote, other most important particulars with reEpect to the disturbances in India, and, finally, a brief. but important refesence to the state et his own balantes. Although Lome hon. members have regretted that othermatters should have been introduced into thisdiscusslon, I have no doubt that it is for the public coonvenience, at, tbis period of the session, that my rght hon. friend should have thus connected the several subjets together, and 1k ,hall follow his example, therefore, in the few observations that I have to make. With respect to the su bjet of Persia, aid the Persian vote, I am a fraid that few among us h ave been surprised at the uasnouncement made to-night. Wo have seen the demandl which in March was, 2650000. grow to 500,0001., and we now find it advanced to 900,0001. That is a tolerably rrapi increment for a period of three months. W n the 2h5o 0 0A OO was first askod for we were told by many memabers what the result would turn out to be, and their vaticin-tions have been only too accura.tely fulfilled.

C waters, ndthe noble lord will not allow the subjfct of China to be alluded to! (Cheers.) The fact is that these discussions are no doubt extremely inconvenient to the Government (cheers and laughter), because the peo. ple of this country must naturally ask themselves "Why are these hoatilities with China not vigorously prosecuted ? and why is that vindication of the honour of England, which we were told a few months ago from every hustings was so important and so necessary, delayed or forgotten r' andbecausethepolicyof t'he nobie lord has in our own possssions brought about a state of affairs that renaers it necessay for us to devote all our energies (oties of " No, no," from the Ministerial side, met by cheers from the Opposition)-all those energies3which are requisite to vindicate our hononr in China and in Persia-to support in an important part of Her &Iajesty's empire onrounrule,whiohjhas been distracted and may be destroyed, bythe policy of the noble lord. (Renewed shouts of "No" from the Mini. sterlal side, and loud cheering from the Opposition benches.) LordPALMERSTON.-I really congratulate the right hon. gentleman upon the belligerent impatience he ha5 manifested (loud laughter, and cheers); and I count upon his entire support when the result of our operations shall crown the wishes he has so ardently expressed. (Cheers and laughter.) I can assure the right hon. gentleman that he wil not be disappointed (laughter), for we are pursuing in proper course the objects which the people of this countrv and the right hon. gentleman so ardently desire-the re. dress of injuries and the vindication of our honour; but we consider that the best mode of attaining those ob. jects Is by pursuing the course sanctioned by international u-sge-namely, by applying in the first instance to the Government of China for redress before proceeding to hostilities. (Cheers.) The right hon. gentleman says I complained that the Chinese question had been introduced into this debate. Now, what I did complain of was that the right hon. member for the University of Oxford should have gone back to the case of the lorcha, and I said nynoble friendappeared to me to have taken a juster view of the subject when he asked questions relating to our genetal policy with regard to China, to the conduct of the war, and to the objects we bad in view. I could not of course complain that the Chinese question should have been introduced, because that is the very subject of the vote we are considerIng. Lord LOUVAINE thought it was a pity those romonstrances to the Emperor of China were not made in the first instance, when we were supposed to have suffered wrong from China. If his recollection served him rigbt, not even 12 hours were allowed to elapse before the admiral in comunand bombarded the defenceless city of Canton (cheers and counter-cheers). when he destroyed several hundreds of lives, and the property of a great number of individuals. ("No, no !" and cheers.) It was such a bombardment as dropping a shell into the city every five minutes. Sir C. WOOD had stated on a former occasion that he did not believe there was any bombardment of Canton, and he had within the last fortnight received a letter from his friend Sir XI Seymoar, stating the interpretation he had put on what occurred was the just and correct one-that it was perfectly untrue that any bombardment of Canton had taken place or that a single shell had been thrown against any of the property of the mhabitants. (Cheers.) Lord LOUVAINE had made no statement that was not borne out by the blue-books. (Cheers.) MIr. ROEBUJCKR asked whether the right hon. baronet (Sir C. Wood) had any objection to produce the letter to which he referred. Sir C. WOOD said the letter was a private letter, (Derve cheers.) It was a private letter from Sir M. Seymour. He vvould bring it down to the House on MIonday night and read that portion which referred to this matter (cheers), since its very existence seemed to be doubted (so we under. stood the right hon. baronet, who spoke with some warmth). Mr. DISRAELI did not suppose that any gentleman in that House doubted the word of any individual in it (cheers), and no one who had sat with the right hon. gentleman in that House could for a moment suppose that he would state what was purposely an equivocation. (Cheers.) But it was quite monstrous to suppose that a Minister should rise in his place, and on an occasion like the present make an important statement from a document not on the table of the House, and say it was private. (Cheers.) It was the rule that a paper used by aMinisterin that House became a State paper, even though it were a private letter. (Cheers.) And it was monstrous that a gentleman in the position of the First Lord of the Admiralty should take offence because a member questioned the propriety of his appealing to a private letter for the purpose of influencing a debate. (Hear.) There should be noreference to any papers that were not on the table, or that were not meant to be laid on the table afterwards, for the moment a Minister referred even to a private letter it became a State document. That was a ealutary principle that had always prevailed in their debates. Were it otherwise the opponents of the Minister could have *no chance in debate, for he miibt always be referring to private papers to support his case. (Cheers.) In the debate on the raotion of the hon. member for Sheffield last night the right hon. gentleman opposite was about referring to a private letterwhenhewascalledin question. [hlr. Smith -" t was a public letter."l What ! a publio letter? Then that was a worse case still. (Cheers.) It wasa most flagirant case-a public document that was a secret from the House referred to in debate by the right hon. gentliman to contradict a statement made by the hon. member for Sheffield (cheers and laughter), and referred to for the purpose of conveying to the House what was the policy of a former Cabinet of which the right hon. gentleman the member for Carlisle was a member. (Hear, hear.) But to return to the point. Before the dissolution of Parliament gentlemen opposite actually cheered because Canton had been bombarded, and now they vociferously cheered because they yere told that Canton was not bombarded. (Cheers.) Lord PALBIERSTON apprehended that the principle which governed the reading of letters was this.-If a Minister read in his place any document, whether public or private, he was bound to lay on the table that which he read. If he read a portion of a privato letter or despatch, and if the House should think that that which he had not read might in any degree alter the sense of that which he bad read, he might justly be required to lay the whole on the table (hear, hear), but he could not admit the expediency of the principle which the right hon. gentleman endeavonred to establish, that a Minister should more than any other member be precluded from repeating to the House information which he had received ina private communication. (Eiear, hear.) So little was that the rule that it often happened that Ministers were asked whether they had received such communications; and, in short, were they precluded from stating to the House information received from the private communicatIons of officers and others, the Eouse would be deprived of much informationwhich itnow obtained. (Hear, hear.) Mr. WHITE thought it probable that the difference of opinion which had arisen as to the bombardment of Canton had sprung up from a misunderstanding. Canton was not, as he believed, bombarded in the sense in which military and civil men understood that word. He understood by bombardment the sending of shot and shell indiscriminately into a town to compel its surrender, and he hesitated not to say that such a bombardment Canton did not undergo. (Hear, hear.) A few shot and shell were sent into the yamun or Government offices to show the Governor of Canton what wo might do, but it was not a bombardment in the ordinary sense. HeIear, hear.) He thanked the noble lord for the explanation e had given regarding thenorthern parts of China. He spoke as a commercial man, and was glad to be able to testify to the importance of a city in %bhich he had pased much of his time,-Shanghai,-where the kindly feelings and sympathies of Chinamen towards Englishmen were constantly called forth, and which, from being a place hardlv noticeable on the map, had now become second in importance as a great entrepot of trade in that part of Asia. (Hear, hear.) He deplored that the high intellience of the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Gladstone), and the constitutional knowledge of thenoble lord the member for London had not led them to address all their vigorous faculties to this subject in a calm and dispassionate spirit. Had they done so, they would have found that the disturbances at Canton did not hinge at al on the flag of the miserable lorcha, but on the consideration whether the course of policy which the Cantonese had consistently pursued towards the English for a long series of years was right or wrong. (Hiear, hear.) For himself, he believed that the ex;travagance of the home Government and the impatience of the Chancellor of the Exchequer with respect to the tea duties (a laugh) had compelled the British merchants in China to submit to a series of indignities which they would never otherwise have tolerated. He would now take the liberty of addressig himself for a moment to the noble lord at the head of theGovernment. (A laugh.) It might be that the course which the noble lord was about to pursue was consistent with the comity of nations and the canons of international law, but in its results it would be a miserable failure. (Hear, hear.) In appealing to the Emperor of China the reply would be what it had always been. There would be again a reference of the appellants to Yeh, who was the Lord Palmerston of China. (Great laughter.) When he said that, let him not be nisauderstood. Yoh was a man of the greatest possible intelligence (an ironical laugh), and flled some of the highest offlces in the empire. Besides being President of the Privy Council. guardian of the heirapparent, and titularcommander-in-chief (laughter) he exercised sumdry other most im;portant functions. But the significance of his position was this, that he was the alto ego of the Emperor, and his decision would be that which would ultimately prevail, undess, as he (Mr. White) trsted would be the case, the noble lord sent out instructions for taking possesion of Canton. In throwing out that suggestion he wanted an augmentation, not of territory, but of trade, and he should be well content with an occupation of Canton in which England should bo united with France, America, and any other- Christian Power. Heo desired, in point of fact, to see Canton held by us s a material guarantee until all our 'equirements had been complied with. ("Hear," and a laugh.) Sir C. NAPIER expressed iis conviction that Sir M. Seymour must have used every effort in his power to obtain by paceable means satisfaction for the outrage on the ilgzha before he fired a single shot into Canton; and, with respect to divulging the contents oF private letters to the House on public affairs, he stted that that was a power Dhich the late First Lord of the Admiralty claimed to I .exercise when in office. Mr. HENLEY reminded the committee that the Chair- man of the East India Company (Mr. Mangles) had stated a that a sumn of more than 500,0001. was still due from the 'Government to the Company over and above the 500,0001. in respect of which the estimate had been mado. Perhaps -the hon. gentleman (IMr. Mangles) would explain how that 'Was? Mn. MANGLES said he spoke from memory when he stated the smm to be 500,0001., and could not at that inomext give the precise amount. There was, however, Oa sum vhich the Company believed the Government owed them, but which the Government, on the other hand, said they did not owe them. (Laughter.) M1r. HENLEY said, It would be desirable to know whether the sum of 500,0001. was a surplus over and above the eutimate now beforethe soue. [r. Bangles.-" No, no!"] What, then, was the su n dispate? The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said, the estimate laid on the table contained the entire expense, is estimated by the East India Company, of the expedition to the Persia Gulf. That was all that the Government undertook to defray whentheY oommunicated with the East India Company, and the Treasry minute on that tubject was perfectly explicit. Some xddltional expeneo w&as incnrred by the East India Company overlAnd, amounting to about 80(1,01., and if that item shonld eventually be deolded to fall within the expenses of the war one moiety of it would bedue from the Exchequer; but at preoent the Government did not admit that that was so, and therefore he had not included the sum in the estimate before the Mr. HEANLEY understood that the .300,0001. was plus the 80,000Z. in the estimate. Mlr. MANGLES said,this estimate included the whole of the estimated expenditure for the expedition to the Persian Gul lThe othersum rehlatedteamatter duponwhiWEch there Company.~ ~ ~ ~ ~~nd Ini Lord J. MANNER5 understoocl the right bon. the Chancellor of the Exchequer to say that the estimato for the war with China was reduced by 100,0001. in consequence of the troops being transferred from Singapore to India, and that, as regarded the 100,0001., it was a matter for conisider. ation whether the East Indis Company should bear a share of that expenditure. The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHIEQUER said, the noble lord kid entirely misunderstood his meaning. The hon. member for EveBham asked whether theexpenseof the transport of troops to India told upon the Engis or upon the idiantreasury. Inhis answer esaidthatgenerallythe rule had been that the expense of the transport of British troops sent to do service for the East Indfa Company fell upon the lindian treasury ; bat that with regard to those troops destined originally for China, but now ordered to stop at Singapore and diverted to India, it was a question whether it ought to fall upon the English or the Indian treasury. The vote was then agreed to. 'Upon a vote of 400,0001. towards naval and military operations in China, Mtr. PALE confessed his utter ignorance whether we wereoraverenotat thismomentat war withChina. They were told that the war was confined to hostilties botween Commissiontr Yeh and Sir J. Bowring. The question was whether the money they were now called on to vote was in aid of a war against China ? Were we or were we not at war with China? Lord PALEBRSTON thought that the condition of our relations with China was pretty well understood by this time. Hqstilities of very serious magnitude had occurred between the local Government of Canton andour authori. ties, naval aud miitary, at Hongkong. Those hostilities had led to considerable expense, bat with regard to the Empire of Chin, we were not at war. We were in a state of perfectly good relations with the other fonr ports, and were not at war at present with the Emperor of China. We had sent a commissioner to negotiate with the Emperor of China, in the hope that by his own authority he would give those orders which would pirevent actual war with the empire. That was the actual state o£ things at present. Lord J. MANNERS asked whether this sum included the cost of transport? Sir C. WOOD aid, that nearly the whole of the voto was for the trasport of troopos. The estimato was originally 501,0001. for the transport and lodging of the troope. Havingdivertedtehe troops fromCanton to Indiatheywould notbe lodgedatCanton, and the vote was redud dfrom Colonel KNOX said, that as they now distinctly understood we were not at wrar with the Emperor of China, he wished to know whether, in the event of Lord Elgin arrauging the matters In dispute with Commissioner Yeh, Commirssioner Yeh would be authorized to give us indemnity for the expenst a incurred? Lord PALMERSTON said, he had not stated that Lord Elgin would negotiate with Commissioner Yeh. Lord Elgin was gone to aegotiate with the Government of Pekin. (Hear, hear.) Colonel KNOX said the noble lord had not answered the question. If he had understood the noble lord correctly, the noble lord stated that we were not at war with China. Therefore we had no cause of quarrel with the Emperor The quarrel was with Yeh, and what ha wanted to know was wvhether there was any possibility of Yeh having power to indemnify us for what we had expended? Lord PAL MERSTONSaid, hahad stated that we were not at war with China, but had great cause of complaint against a subordinate officer of the Emperor, and had demanded redress of the Emperor, seeing that the local authorities were not able to procure redress from the subordinate officer. The Emperor, of conrse, could do what he pleased as far as giving powers to indemnify us. Colonel BOLDERO said, the number of men voted fo rthe colonies and for home service was 123,000. The Governmeat was taking away 15,000 or 20,000 man. He wished to know whether the Government intended to raise the force of men, and if s, how could it be done? Lord PALMERSTON was understood to say that by recruiting and withdrawing men from the colonies the Government would replace the men sent to Lndia, or a portion of them. The vote was then agreed to. Upon a vote of 2,000 additional men for the sea service, Lord VANE TEMPEST said, that the vote of 2,000 additional men for the navy naturally brought forward tho wbole subject of home defences. If he were to follow his own view he should propose that the chairman report progress. He did not know whether the exigencies of critical times in India made it a necessity that the vote should be passed this evening, and as he was a comparatively inexperienced member, he would not undertake, unless he were supported in his view, the grave duty of urging the postponement of thevote. But as a member of the House, and as an officer of the army. he could not refrain from bringing before the notice of the House the extraordinary position in which we stood with regard to the army. There had been considerablo discussion upon the several wars into which we had been brought by the noble lord at the head of the Government. He wvas one of those who supported the noble lord in his Chinese policy, and his main reason for so doing was that he thought that the honour of the English flag should be maintained, and that officers in responsible situations at a distance should be upheld by the Government at home. Ho shared in the feeling expressed by the right hon. gentleman the member for Buckinghamshire, and agreed in thinking the tone of the noble lord with regard to his Chinese polioy very different from the tone he adopted on the momentous occason which produced the late dissolution-a change which 'was not hkely to meet with approvaL. But what he wished to bring to the notice of the comrmittee was that, simultaneously with the war in China, simultaneously with the expedition to Persia, simultaneously, if it could be proved, with warn. mgs both from the Commander-in-Chief and the GovernorGeneral of India of their uneasy sensations with regard to what they conceived to be an uncomfortable feelino in the Bengal army (cries of " Oh !")-simultancously with those three events, the noble lord at the head of the Government had sanctioned an enormous diminution of the army and navy. (Hear.) The regiments of the army had been reduced by 150 or 200 men, the artillery had been reduced by 2,000 experienced men, and they were now recruiting young soldiers to fight the battles of England. It wasalate hoor to detain them-lo'dock-buthe felt bound to state, and he believed events would corroborato his statemont, that grave responsibility restedaupon the Government for entering into wars which they conceived the polioy of England required, at the same time that they de'termined toreduce the army totheextenttheyhaddone. Thequestion which he wished to ask tho noble lord was whether he interded to increase the army? (Hear, hear.) He also wished to know what steps the Government intended to take in order to replace the 20,000 men who were about to proceed to India? The House had heard from different members of the Government the most contradictory statements with respect to the conveyance of our troops to India. One had stated that some were to bo sent in sailing vessels and some in steamers; another that no steamers were to be employed as transports; while the First Lord of the Admiralty had instituted a comparison that evening between the capabilities of sailing vessels and steamers. Now, the question was not one of sailing vessels or steamers, but one of sailing vessels with auxiliary screws. Our merchants ipaid an increased freight forthe advantage of placing their goods on board ships 'with auxiliary screws, because to them time was money, and he asked, was it not equally so to us in the present critical posture of affairs in India? The House was asked to vote 2,000 additional men for the navy; but no addition was to be made to the army, although a large militaryforce was to be sent to India, and events might occur in Europe to render extremely dangerous the want of a suffident number of troops in this country. He hoped that the House would not be lprevented bv the Government from discussing the defenceless state of the nation, and thinking that the present vote would afford them an excellent opportunity of doing so, if postponed till some more convenientoccasion, hemoved that the Chairman report progress and ask leave tosdta3gain. Sir C. WOOD assured the noble lord that he had not the sihghtest wish to prevent a discussion upon the state of our defences. What he had objected to was the raising of that important question incidentally upon a motion for the adjournment of the House. He had already, in reply to a question fromthe hon. andgallant memberforWest Norfolk, stated the reasons which induced him to ask for 2,000 additional men for the navy. A naval squadron was indispen. sably necessary in th. Indian Ocean; and, inordertoprovide it with efficient crews, the House must authorize him to in. crease the seamen in our service by the number mentioned in the vote. Hle hoped the noble lord would not persist in his motion for reporting progress. Admiral WALCOTT was only sorry that the First Lord had not asked for 5,000 men instead of 2,000, because he was persmaded that our navy was far from being in a proper state of efficiency. The blockships referred to by the right hon. baTonet in the early part of the evening were, it was true, in a state of perfect order; but they were only four or five in number, and they were all we had for the defence of eor coasts. We had four sail of the line in the Mediterranean, one at the Cape of Good Hope, one in the Indian Ocean, one in the Pacific, and one on the Coast of Brazil; but to meet any sudden emergenoy we had not a single line of battle ship upon which we could depend. He considered that a fearful circumstance, and trusted that the Government would give it their earliest and most serious attention. Mr. HENLE Y hoped the Government would consent to the motion to report progress. Tho CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER begged the Houe to agree to the vote. Admiral-WALCOTT asohoped the House would agree to the vote. Sir 0. WOOD said, as there was no objection to the vote itself, he trusted the House would assent to it, and any dis- cusi,on upon the state of the national defences would be taken upon the report. Colonel KlsOX wished to know how the defLcisncv thab would be caused by the number of men to be sent to India would be provided for, so as to keep the force at home in au efficient state. ord PrALMERSTON observed thst the vote apphed to the naval force only. As to the army, recruiting oould be carried on to supply the deficiencies cxaued bY the removal of troops to Ind a, and if that sourceshould fail tho Gover. mient would havo to consider what other stepe should be adopted. He hoped, however, the committee could agree to tho vote, as sny discusion that was desred would take place on the report. Admiral DUNCOMBE was In favour of agreeing to the vote. Sir a. NAPIER wislied to make some. obserrstlons, and therefore supported the motion for reporting progress. Mx. BENTINCK said if the vote wao gred to he trusted the report would be brought up at an hour which would permit of discussion. Sir C. WOOD assured the commitiee that the report *hould be brought up the first thing on Monday. (fear.) Lord A. V. TEMPEST then withdrew his amend. muent. The motion was then withdrawn, and the vote was agreed to, as werealso the foUowing:- 70,0821. for additional eaimen. 28,276C. for the purchase of prov;ions, victaualing stores, The House then resumed, and leave was given to the Chairman to sit again, ILLICIT ))ISTILLATIO1T (IRELAND) BILL. This Bill was read a second time. R3FORMATORY SCHOOS BIL. Certain amendments In this Bill were considered and agreed te, and the Bill waordered to be read a third time on Monday. The Valuation of Lands (Scotland) Act Amendment Bill was read a seconl time. PARLIAMENTARY OATHS. Iord J. RUSSELL, in moving for leave to bring it a Bill to amend the 1st and 2d of Victoria, chap. 108, entitled " An Aet to remove doubts as to the Validity of certain Oaths," said that the Act which he iashed to amend was introducedbyLord Dnman, toenablep,rsonsto take an oath accordingto the formandceremonybindingon their own conscience. Tho sameAct renderedanyperson forawearing him. self liable to the pains and penalties attaching to peruury. There was some doubt in that Act as to how far its prin. Ciple would extend, and be now proposed that that principle should apply to members of the High Court of Parliament. This would not necessitate any alteration in the substance of the oath, but only in the form in which it was taken in particular cases. This Bill was In conformity with what he believed was the law for 200years, and, at all events, with what Lord Hardwicke declared to be the law in the last oentnry. The noble lord concluded by asking for leave to bring in the Bill. Mr. WALPOLE said that the statement of the noblo lord did not convey a just idea oflhisobject. (Erear, hear.) The Bill which he proposed to introduce was grafted on an Act passed at the commencement of tihe present reign for an object essentially distinct from that of the present measute. The Aot of tho 1st and 2d of Victori simply enabled witnesses in courts of law to bo sworn in the form most binding on their consciences, in order that the ends of justice might not fail, whereas the BiU of the noble lord sought not only to admit members of the Jewish persuassion to Parliament, but to set aside the deliberat judgment of the Court of Exchequer, which had determined that the words, "upon the true faith of a Christian," were not a part of the form but a part of the substance of the oath. (Hear, bear.) Another strong objection to the Bill was, that it was an a'tempt to violate the spirit of the rules and practice of Parliament by reopening a question which had been already determinea in t'he present session. (Hear, hear.) The House was asked deliberately to put itself in antagonism with the other branch of the Legislature-a course which bad nover been regarded as a wise one, and which could only be pursued when the object of those who advocateditwas not toconvinebut to overawe their oppo. Denti. (Cheers from below the gangway on the 31inisterial side.) Hon. gentlemen who cheered might rely upon it they were embarking in a course pregnant with the {reatest danger, the result of which could only be to impar the dignity and weaken the authority of Parliament. An additional argument against the Bill was that it was most inexpedient at that late period of tho sesdon, when they had such a multiplidty of other bueiness on their hands, to revive a question which bad not only been regularly decided alreadv, but which could not be brought on again without provoling prolonged debates. (Rear, hear.) Mr. ROEBUCK thought this BIll wholly unnecezsary. The Act to which the noble lord had referred contained very remarkable words. The House oughb to be their own lawyers on this occasion. The Act of Parlinent declared that in all cases in which an oath was administered either to ajuryman, or witness, or deponent, or upon appointment to any office or employment (hear), "or upon any occasion whatsoever" (hear) the person tahng an oath shodtake itin the form most binding upon bis conscience. He asked the House at once to settle this question by saying that a member coming to the table should take the oath in the manner mosc binding upon his conscience. In its own case the House ought to be the sole expounder of tho law. In the first session in which he became a mernber of that House Mr. Pease came to the table and declared that he was a Quaker and would not take the oath. The House therefore immediately dispensed with the Act of Parliament 'which imposed the oath, and permitted Mr. Pease to make an affirmation. Why should not the House adopt a similar courso upon the present occasion? (Cheers.) TheHouseof Lords in Lord Wensleydale's case assumed to be the judge of its own privileges, even in a case in which it opposed the prerogative of the Crown; and why should not the House of Commons iieclare itself the judge of its own priviteges f He sgreed with the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Walpole) that this Bill ought not to be brought in, but as it was better than leaving the inatter as it now stood, he should vote with the noble lord. He asked the noble lord, however, to adopt a bolder course. For bimself he was-willing to bravo every danger, and the noble lord should find him strong supporter. Mior. NEWDEGATE said, it was obvious that the ques tion required more matmuediscussion than it was liLefy to receive at that hour of the morning (10 minutes past 2). He therefore moved the adjournment of the House. There vas no analogy between the course suggested by the hon. and learned member for Sheffield and tlhat taken by the House of Lords in Lord WVensleydale's case. The Oaths Bill affected the Upper Houee as well as the House of Commons, while the admission of life peers was a matter affeeting the urivileges of their lordships' House and not of the Lower House. The Bill was a tyrannical and revolutionary attempt to overawe the other House in the exercise of a fair discretion, said he should accordingly divide the House upon the question of adjournment. Mr. SALISBURY thought that the noble lord (S. Rufsell) had taken a constitutional course, and he trasted that the House would not follow the advice of the hon. and learned member for Sheffield. He should be glad to see Baron Rothschild in the House, but he would be no party to admit him in an unconstitutional manner. The Hou2e then divided, and the numbers were,- Ayes ... ... ... ... ... 55 Noes ... ... ... ... ...109 Majority against the adjournmente... Mr. WARREN then moved the adjournment of the debate. Lord J. RUSSELL took occasion, in reply to the observations of Mr. Newdegate, to state that he had no wish to coerce the House of Lords into a decision upon the subject. He must, however, contend that due regard ought to be idtotheprivilegesof the Houso of Commons, arndh at the House of Lords alone ought not to be allowed to entertain questions by which its privileges were supposed to be affected. The noble lord then entered into the history of the subject, and cited the case of lr. Pease in order to prove that the House of Commons had dispensed with tho oath and permitted an affirmation to bo taken in its stead. He also cited the opinion of Baron Alderson in support of the view that the words " on the true faith of a Christian" had not been originally introduced into the oath for tho purpose of meeting the case of the Jews, but to obviate certain doctrines which, upon the part of Eoman Catholics, were supposed to have been entertained. It was quite evi. dent, hovrever, the noble lord added, that the object of hon. members opposite Was to prevent 3 fair consideration of the question, and if they were prepared to proceed in that policy he for one should advise Baron Rothschild to come to the table of that House and claim his right to take his seat as the representative of the city of London. Mr.WHiTESIDE, in answver totbenoble lord, said he and his hon. friends nearhim, were desirous that full discussion should take place on the important subject before them, and it was with that view that his hon. and learned friend tho member for Midhurst bad moved the adjournment of the debate, That he thonght was no unreasonable propsti... seeing toat it was near 3 o'clock, Mr. ROEBUCK contended that there wVas no occasiton for theadjournment of the debate as, theproper timeto taIe tbe discussion upon the Bill would be when it came on for recond reading. He for one was disposed to move that Baron Rothschild should be allowed to take his seat in that Houso without the neessity of tsing the oath. a Dd if he were to do so he (Mr.Iioebuck) rould be prepare i to move that any pesn should prosecute the noble baron for having taken that ourse should be deemed guilty of a breach of the privileges of that Honse. Lord LOVAINE protested against the revolutionarvdoctrine which had been advanced by the hon. and learned muember who had just spoken-a doctrine which was similar to that contained In the resolution of the hon. member for Swansea (Mr. Dilwyn). Mr. DILLWYN denied that the motion which he had announced it to be his intention to submit to the House was one of a revolutionary character. Mr. NEW3DEGATE said, that his only object in moving the adjournment of the House was that a full discussion upon the importnt motion of the noble lord the member for ndon might take place. He most stronlpretested aganst the revolutionar doctrines which had in the course of the discussion been promulgated. The House then divided. The numbewere- Ayes . .. ... ... ... 52 N Yoes ... ... ... .4. ... ...:00 ' Majority against the adjournment of the debate ... ... ... ... Mr. HUbE then moved the adjoxnsment of the Hous amid cries of " Oh, oh hI and " ear, hear!" The House again divided. The numbers were- Ayes ..51 Agoes ... ... ... '... ... 97 Majority against the adjournment.. 746 Sir B. BRIDGES then rose to express a hope that the bouW.d to say that the right hon. gentleman . .a ak them whether it wvs to their convenience that the adjournment should take place, and they replied in the affirmative; and no doubt it was, for tu have two hoars In one committee-room and two hours in auother was a geat convenience to counsel. (Elear, hear.) It did so appen that the counsel engaged before this committee were employed In two other rooms. I assure the right hon. gean tleman that I have had no conbert with the noble lord in raising this disecsion, and, withont wishing to 'find fault vith the right hon. gentleman, I may express a hope that the course taken by hun will not be made a precedent in fature cases. (Hear, hear.) Sir H. VERNEY observed that the sitting of the committee to-day commenced at 11 o'clock, and did not terminate until 4, so that it occupied more than two hours. ("Hear," and laughter.) When the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Horsman) proposed the adjonrnment no objection was made by any one. He (Sir H. Verney) Lnew what the right hon. gentleman's object was, and he was sorry to say that the counsel on both sides said they were very glad of the adiournment. (LaIghter.) Mr. NEWDEGATE said that the course pnrsned.with regardtothe adournmentof the committee was directly opposed to the usual practice. It might have been fortn. nate for the meeting that a gentleman possessing the experience of the right hon. gentleman who occupied the chair, but the object of thatmeeting seemed to have been to disturb the proceedings of the House. (The hon. gentleman was interrupted by crles of "Oh, oh !" from the Ministerial benches, answered by loud cheers from the Opposition). He (Mr. Newdegate) thought he might be excused for making the observation, because he remembered some unfortunate scenes which had taken place in the House, and he knew that many hon. members of experience, and many right hon. gentlemen on the other side, were most anxious to avoid the repetition of procoedings which might bring the authority of the House in collision with theauthority of the law. (Hear, hear.) He wished to ask the hon. member for Swansea (Mr. Diliwyn) to what day he meant to postpone his motion, because so long as it remained upon the paper it must occasion some anxiety. Lord GALWAY explained that he had inadvertently stated that the committee could have concluded their inquiry if they had sat two hours longer yesterday, for one of the witnesses whose attendance was required was not present yesterday, and was only produced this morning. Mr. CHEETHAN said his right hon. friend had stated to him his reason for wishing that an adjournment should take place, and the counsel engaged in the case expressed their willngness to accede to the suggestion. Mr. ROEBUCK.-I wish to notice an observation made by the noble lord (Lord Galway). He said if he had known the object with which the adjourment was proposed he would have divided the committee. (Cheers and countor cheers.) It Is clear, therefore, that tho division would have taken place not on account of the parties concerned (cheers), but on account of the feeling of the noble lord with regard to a partioular question. (Renewed cheers.) Not knowing the precise object for which the adjournment was desired, the noble lord assented to it; but if he had been aware of that object, he would have opposed the proposal. It is clear the object of the meeting would have been the only ground on which the noble lord would have opposed the adjourn. ment. (Cheers.) I want to know whether the fact is ascertained that when the right hon. gentleman (MIr. Horsman), the chairman of the committee, proposed the adjournment he did so in the hearing of the counsel and the parties. The noble lord (Galway) has insinuated-for he has not openly stated-that counsel assented to the adjournment for their own private interests. I say the noble lord has cast a slur upon those counsel which he had no right to cast upon them. ("Oh, oh !" and "hear, hear.") This may be a laughing matter to the noble lord. (The hon. gentlemen alluded we, believe, to Lord Galway.) You pelt frogs; it is an amusement to you, but it is death to them. (" Oh !" and a laugh.) It may be an amusement to the noble lord to cast reflections upon hon. members who get their bread by intellectual labour.) The hon. and learned member was interrupted by cries of " No, no," "Yes," and cheers.) I say the imputation of the noble lord was not justified. I don't know the names of any of the counsel engaged in the case. I say that it being clear the parties to the inquiry were present when the adjournment was suggested, that it was made in their hearing and in the hearing of their connse' that they assented to it, and that, as hag been stated by the right hon. gentlemen (Mr. Horsman), neither party has been subjected to one shiUling's expense in consequence of the adjournment, the noble lord's assumption that the adjournment was icmproper is wholly attributable to his having subsequently discovered the object of that adjournment. He was not careful of the interests of the parties nntll his own feelings were concerned. (" Hear," and cheers.) Mr. S. FITZGERALD (a member of the committee) said, -I believe the facts are these :-The right hon. gentleman communicated to the members of the committee who sat near him t'ne object for which he desired an adjournment. All I heard passing in the committee and all my noble friend heard, was, that the right hon. gentleman addressing us said, "<It is quite impossible for me to attend to-tsorrow." ("Hear," and cheers.) The right hon. gentleman repeated that statement with considerable emphasis. I must say, when that language was used, I for one supposed there was some insurmountable obstacle to the right hon. gentleman's attendance. I supposed he had some engagement in connexion with public business in this House, or at least of extreme importance, and that he therefore felt it necessary to appeal to the parties and to his colleagues to adjourn under the peculiar ciecumstances of the case. I do not think any one would have anticipated from the right hon. gentleman's language that his only object was to preside over a pubic meeting. I may further say that while under any circumstances I should be unwilling to put parties to the extreme inconvenience and expense which the adjournment of an inquiryrmust occasion,Icertainlywouldnothave consented to the adjournment in this case if I had known the ground upon which it was proposed, whatever the objeet of the publi meeting might have been. (Cheers.) It is perfecty true that the parties to the inquiry, as well as my noble friend and mysel , consented to the adjournment ; but it was put to us almost as a matter of impossibility that the right hon. gentleman could attend. I should not have troubled the House with these observations if I had not felt that we are to a certain extent culpable for having assented to an adjournment upon such a ground. Mr. HORSMAN.-I trust I may make one remark upon the extraordinary statement of the noble lord. (Cries of "Spoke," and cheers.) Itrust the House wiUl permit me to do so, becauso it is very painful to be at issue as to a matter of fact with gentlemen who ought to be so well informed as the noble lord and the hon. gentleman. I am, however, fortified by the presence of two other members of the commiteee, and by my own distinct recollection and positive knowledge, when I say there is not the very smallest foundation in fact for the assertion that I stated it was impossible for rme to attend. (" Oh !" and cheers.) On the contrary, it was not until after the adjournment had been agreed to that I came out of the committee-room, saw my friends, and consented to take the chair at the meeting, and if the slightest objection had been made to the adjournment I should not have been able to attend the meeting at all. I stated to the counsel three times over that, if it was quite for their convenience, a suggestion for an adjournment might be made, but I said not one single syllable about my attendance next day. I gave neither the counsel, the agents, nor the parties the least reason to know whether it was for my convenience, or for that of the noble lord, or the hon. gentleman (Mr. Fitzgerald), or any other member of the committec, that the adjournment should take place. (Cries of "- Order ") Lord J. MANNERS.-Is the right hon. gentleman confining himself to an explanation? (Hear, hear.) Mr. HORSMAN.-The confusion as to facts to which, after a lengthened sitting upon a scrutiny, wo are very linble-(Cries of "Oh !" and "Order !") I make n's charge against hon. gentlemen, (Oh, ohl) but I say that such eonfusion as to facts may lead to assertion for which there is not the smallest foundation. ("Oh!f" and a laugh.) No person in the committee-roomn, except two hon. gentlemen now sitting near me, knew that it was for my convenience that the adjournment took place. I feel how unfair and unjust it is to the parties that inquiries before committee should be protracted one day longer than is absolutely requisite, or that they should be subjected to a shiUing of unnecessary expense. 1 should be extremely sorry and unwilling to subject them to any in. convenience; and when I stated to the parties in this case that an adjournment might be proposed, I took care to say there was no strong wish on the part of the committee on the subject. I told.them three times over that we consulted their convenience, and their convenience only. Sir J. PAIKITNGTON thought the House could have no wish that this discussion should be continued (hear, bear); and he therefore begged to put a question to the Under-Secretary to the Treasury. Colonel KNOX also attempted to address the House, but was received with cries of "O Order" and counter cheers. Sir G. GREY rose to order, and submitted that it was irregular on the part of the hon. and gallant member (Colonel Knox) to interpose between the lHouseand the right hon. gentleman (Sir J. Fakiugton), after the Speaker had called on the right hon. gentleman to proceed with the question which stood on the paper iu his name. Sir J. PAKINGTON said, he had risen to ask his quesion under the full impression that it was the wish of the House to put an end to the discussion. (Cries of - No, no " answered by counter cheers.) He understood a ruie had lately been made by which papers presented by command of Her Majesty were no longer to be distributed to members of the House in the usnal way, but were to be accessible to members on application at the Voteoffice. No member could be more anxious than he was to see the expense of printing the papers of the Houselessened, but be was -till of opinion that if there was one thing of more importance than another in the perforuance of their functions as members of that House it was that all possible information should be accessible to them on all occasions. (Hear, hear.) The hoen member for Fuisbury had lately given notice of his intention to move for leave to bring in a Bill to repeal the existing laws respecting vaccination. The Government, on the other hand. had given notice that they 'were about to introduce a Bill to amend the exist. ilg law on that subject, and a most important paper i reference to the prevention of the spread of sEmal1pox had recently been presented to the ouseoby command of Her ajesty. Under the now rule, however, to which he had referred that paper had not been distributed to members in the usual way, and he himself had only heard of its existenoo in an incidental way. Hfe wished, therefore, to ask the Secretary to the Treasury wlhether he (Sir T. Pakington) had h_sen correctly informed as to the nature of the rule in question I Nir. WILSON said, that the rule in question had been adopted in consequence of a report of tbe Printing Committee. It had not, however, been adopted on the sole authority of that committee, but in pur.uance of a recommendation of a committee of the IHouse, of which th,e right hon. gentleman the memberfortheUYniversily of Camai_idge was chairman. CONVEYANCE OF TROOPS TO INDIA. Admiral DUNCOMBE proceeded to call the attention of %lw -it'd JLord Pf the Admiralty to tho necessity of reron- tidering the determination announced by him not to em. ploy any of the screw line of battle ships in coneloying a portion of the troops about to be sent to India. He (Admiral Dnncombe) found we bad now lying idle in harbour 10 magnificent screw line of battle ships, besides numerous frigates, and as, with ono exception, the whole of those ships were employed during the late war he iiaglined that no great length of time would be required to fit them for the conveyance of troop3 to India, a service in which he thought it would be both politic and proper to employ them. (Hear, hear.) He feared that the number of troops under orders to proceed to India were not all that would be required in the emergency, and he would submit to the Pirst Lord of the Admiralty that it would be desirable, even on the score of economy, to employ some of those screw line of battle ships in the way ho had suggested. Besides, any one of those ships would take out a whole regiment, an arrange. ment in every respect more convenient than sending troops by instalments in dfferent sailing vessels. The men would lso be much better off in regard to room and qther accommodation during the long voyage. The presence, too, of such a squadron off the coast of India would. have a great moral effect, and the strong body of seamen they would carry niight be made available in case of emergency. He had ventured to call the attention of the First Lord of the Admiralty to this sabject, in the hope that the right hon. baronet might be induced to reconsider the deternation receptly announced by him. Mr. BENTINCK wished to take this opportunity of troublingthe House with a few words, in consequence of two answers, upon recent occasions, given by the noble lord at the head of the Government and by the First Lord of the Admiralty. The substance of the two answers combined was that the country was about to be left in a totaUy defenceless state by sea and land, and that such a state of things was recognized and concurred in by the noble lord. His hon. and galant friend the member for Southwark asked the First Lord of the Admiralty whether there were any steam vessels ready to carry troops to China. The right hon. baronet said there were not, and then went on to say there was not a single screw steamahip of the line in commission fit to carry troops to India. The right hon. baronet added that " IHe had stated on more than one occasSon that he had given up the idea of maintaining a home squadron, The ship3 in commission were aUl calculated for home defence, and not for the conveyance of troops." He ventured to assert that the ahips in commission at our ports at home were as il-adapted for the purposes of de fence as for carrying troops. The other question was put by the right hon. gentleman the member for Buokinghamshire. T.e right hon. gentleman asked the noble lord what were the intentions of the Government with respect to the calling out of the militi in the present year. The answer was one of the most remarkable ever given bv a Prime Mnister. He thought some of the sentences so remarkable that he took them down, and he should no doubt be corrected if he did not quote them correctly. The noble lord s at there was no intention of calling out the militia this year, because he considered the two previous years' training rendered it unnecessary for the purpose of main- taining the discipline of those corps. But the noble lord, then went on to say- The SPEAKER. called the attention of the hon. gentleman to its being contrary to the rules of the House to refer to answers given by ton. members, and to read those answers in the House in the same session. Mr. BENTINCK said, he would bow with the utmost deference to the Speaker's decision, but he was very much mistaken if he had not frequently heard the rule infringed. He must throw himself upon the indulgence of the House to allow him to state the substance of what fell from the noble lord. He would not attempt to read what the noble lord said, but the substance was that, although he was not prepared to call out the militia in the present year, if any. thing had happened in Europe which had threatened to involve this country in a war with any European Power, and which rendered it probable that we should have to provide for the defence of the country - The SPEAKER submitted to the hon, member that he was infringing one of the rules of debate in referring in so direct a manner to passages of former debates. It was contrary to the established rule of the House. lr. BEN EINCK was at aloss to know how he was to introduce the subject, which was one of the utmost imDportance, if he were not allowed to advert to anything which had faUen from the noble lord. He did not see how he could possibly go on unless he were allowed so far to refer to tho statements of the noble lord as to call attention to what he conceived to be objectionable and dangerous doctrines promulgated by the noble lord. The SPEAKER said, that the hon. maember could state his opinion upon anything which had faUen from the noble lord. Mr. ROEBUCK.-Suppose he said " so and so." Mr. BENTINOK would imagine that the noble lord said that "If anything had happened in Europe which had threatened to involve this country in a war with any European Power, and which rendered it probable that we should have occasion to provide for the defence of the country, it might have been necessary to call out the militia." The noble lord went on to say- (cries of "Ordear ') if the noble lord went on to say, as he conceived it possible he might, that he imagined there was no probability or possibility of any such contigency of European disturbance, aud if the noble lord gave that as a reason for not calling out the militia this year, he contended that the noble lord would have held doctrines most dangerorus to the safety of tho country. He assumed, for the sake of argument only, that the noble lord had held such opinions, and he appealed to the House whether such opinions, coupled with tho answer of the First Lord of the Admiralty, did not substantiate his statement that this country was to be left without defences by sea or land? The noble lord rested his case solely upon the ground that thera was no apparent probability of disturbauces in Europc. It would bo extremely Indiscreet to go into details as to the various causes which might lead to collision between this country and a great Euroean Power. But he thought the House would agree with him that, whatever the apparent security, the snap of one pistol might involve that seeurity and place this country in hostile collision with one of the most powerful antagonists with whom she could have to contend. He asked the House whether it was reasonable to leave the conetry totally without the means of defence both by sea and land-whether it was rational for the Government to trust to the chapter of accidents for security ? He would place it on a mere commercisl basis, and ask whether it was not perfect insanity to leave the country at the mercy of the first comer who might choose to assail her, when by a trilling outlay the country might be placed in a state of security ? He did not think that by sueh false economy as that the noble lord would retain the support of the House and the good opinion of the people. (Hear.) Mr. HORSMAN was afraid that an empression had fallen from his lips which, if left unexplained, might be liable to misconstruction. It seemed to he supposed that in something which he said he reflected upon the conduct of two members of the Bath Election Committee. He was sure that the House would at once acquit him of any such Intention. 'What he meant to say was that there must have been some mistake or slight defect of memory on the part of the noble lord and the hon. gentleman, arising from the long and tedious nature of the inquiry in which they had been engaged, but he had not the slightest idea of casting any reflection upon them, and he regretted that any words of his should have been so interpreted. (Eear, hear.) Mr. DILLWYN, in reply to the question of the hon. member for North Warwickshire, stated that he could not name the day on which he should bring forward his motion relative to the Oath of Abjuration,because it depended upon the fate of the measure which the noble lord, the member for the city of London, intended to introduce that evening. The hon. gentleman added that,as he should not be allowed to address the House again, he might take that opportunity of asking the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether the manufacture of pulp parchment was allowed to continue, pending the decision of the Court of Exchequer as to whether or not it was paper; and, if so, under what conditions ? (& laugh.) Sir C. WOOD hoped that the stat' of confusion into which the House had now got upon the simple question of adjournment would induce them in future to avoid the inconvenient practico of raising debates upon important subjects in such a desultory and unsatisfactory manner. (Hear, hear.) The defences of the country involved a question of the greatest possible interest and magnitude,and ought not to be discussed incidentally, but with becoming calmness and deliberation. (Hear, hear.) It was perfectly true, as he stated on a previous occasion, that none of ihe ships of tho line now in commission wero fitted to carry troops to Iadia or China, although admirably adapted for the defence of our own coasts. Most of them were blockships which served in the Baltic. They were steamships, powerfuUy armed, capable of moving about the coasts of England or even thoso of a neighbouring country; but they were not calonlated for long voyages to distant places. Two of them, it was true, had been sent across the Atlantic in fine weather; but all of them were vessels of small steam power, and he did not think we should be justified in trusting to them for the eon- voyanco of troops to distant parts of the world. (Eea', hear.) No doubt there were in ordinary a great number Or line of battle ships which might be employed as transports if it were thought advisable so to use them. But there were other services to be performed of at least equal importancoe. He had stated before that the number of men employed had not been reduced to the number voted by Parliament, aud later in the evening he proposed to. ask tho House to vote 2,000 more. Tho wan of men was, indeed, severely felt, and if he were to commission ten or a dozen line of battle ships he must raise an additional number of men before he could send them to sea. The 2,000 men whom he proposed to ask the House to vote that evening were intended to man a squadron ia tho Indian ocean; and, when he was called upon to commission line of battle-ships for transport pur. poses he begged to ask how he was to provide them with crows? On the other hand he could employ the Qaeen's ships for war purposes, and at the same time call upon the merchant sirvice to furnish vessels for the conveyance of our troops to India or China-n division of labour which he thought would be productive of tho greatest efficiency. (Hear, bear.) It had been said that we ought to have large vessels like the Himalaya for the transportof troops. Now, in point of fact, there were eight ships-not all so large as the Himalaya, but nearly so-in employment at the present moment. One of them, the Transit, was well known in that House, and ho might mention to her hononr that she had made the voyage to China in a shorter time than the Himalaya. (A laugh.) Six of them were now actually employed in conveying troops to India. (Hear, hear.) But it wis A mist4ke to suppose that steameats sarxeowa3s prefer- able to salling vessels for tho transport of troops. For shorn voyages steamers ought, if possible to be employed, but fo* long voyages, and at particular times of the year sailing vessels were nearly, if not quite as goodL The delay otf coaling in the case of steamers was often considerableo He had inquired of the Secretary of Lloyd's what, was thus average time occupied by sailing ships to India, and he was informed that fast xailing vessels dospatched from this.r country, at the present seon of the year, performed theitvoyages in from 90 to 101 days, which was pretty mucs. the same time as was occupied by steamers. Some olthe Peninsular and Oriental Company's steanivessels hat. performed the voyage in less time, bat those vessels. were built for speed, carried littlo cargo, and consmact much fuel. Steamvessels carrying troops would not be able to take on board so much fael, on account of the spac- which would ho occupied by the necesary provisions and6 water for the troops, and the numerous places at whicir. they must call to replenish those stores would induce a delayr greater than that which the employment of sailing s;cpi would cause. He found, from a statement which had beem prepared, that of foar steamers which had belonged to thae hon. member for Tynemouth, and which had been emc ployed under contract to convey mails to Calcutta, thb contract time was 74 days, whereas the actual time occupie7, was respectively 107 days, 121 days, 100 days, and 90 days, making an average of 104 days. Another matter for c,,n. sideration was, that there had been very heavy demands made lately upon the stores colected at the Cape of Goodf Hope, and although fresh supplies had been sent out, yet: they could bardly. be expected to arrive in sufficient quan.- tities and wiith suficient regularity to meet the; require. ments of the large number of steam vessels which would bar. required to convey the troops nowv under orders for India. He repeated, that it was considered to be best to rely uooim the merchant service for transport,and to leave to the Royai navy the duties of defence., ARTILL3RY FOR INDIAL Colonel NORTH asked the Under Secretary for Wae what force of Artilery was to proceedioIndia, and whethee* or not they wero to take guns, ammunition, and horses, antf if not, to state the reasons; also what staff of ArtiLierSt was to comnmand and directthis force?- - Sir J. RAMSDEN said, it was inteiided to Eend out t(i India six companies of Foot Artilleryiandtwo- troops otHorse Artillery. They were not to take out either guns oi'ammunition, as the arsenals of India were amply suppliedg and it was desirable that the men should be sent out as speedily as possible, without the delay which *ould bte caused by sending out guns and ammunition with them. WVith regard to the latter portion of the honR and gallant gentleman's question, it referred to a matter d military organization, respecting wFhich he hoped the itj quiry would not be pres6ed. JEWISH DISABILITIES. Lord J. RUSSELL.-Although I am sensible that thesE debates upon the question of the adjournment to Mondai are Inconvenient I rise upon this occasion in consequenc of the strong feeling which prevails among my constitu ents to ask what is the decision of the Government with re spect to the Bill of which I have given notice. The positior of my constituents is that, although they have four timeelected Baron Lionel de Rothschild a member of this House (hear, hear), he has hitherto been unable to take his seatr Successive Governments have attempted to relieva him anal his Jewieh brethren from the disabilities to waich they are subject by passing BiUs in this House and sending them tc5 the other House of Parliament. It has been supposed some* wbat maliciously that the City of London was satisfied witla three members, and that they did not perceive the necessityof being represented in this House by a larger number. Bat that is not the fact. (;Eear, hear.) The city of London is anxious to haveafull representation, butthey have consentec. for atime to forego that privilegein order to vindicateanothoe privilege dear to the people of this country-that of send. ing members to this House without regard to religioucr disqualifications. (Hear, hear.) The House of Lords hag. again rejected a Bill which was intended to remove thep. Jewish disabilities. It has been supposed hitherto-and 1]7 think fairly supposed-that the majorities in this Houie' being generally small, sometimes 25, at others' 30, thEHouse of Lords considered that in that divided state ot opuiion it was not bound to give effect to the wishes of thei House of Commons; butit appeaTs from the late divisionthafi such cannot be the grouna of their refusal to entertain thu>, Bill, because that Bill, besides beiDg supported by the whole authority andweightof the Government, had a majority of 140C in Its favour upon the decisive test of the words " on the trac faith of a Christian." It is obvious that we may send£ another Bill next year to the House of Lords, and next yeae another, but that it so large a majority as that is not to pre. vail with the House of Lords there is no chance that such s. BiU, in that form, wiU be accepted by that House. Lot meD say, however, that as those BiUs bore the shape of a changer in the law, and the one which wo sent up last professed tcs. effect a change in the form of oaths to be taken by members.- of this and the other House, it was undoubtedly within tha. constitutional functions of the louse of Lords to refusu a Bill thus making a chango In the law.. But th% question that occurs to me-and I think not unnaturally-is whether the city of London is to ba. satisfied 'with the defective state of their represent: tion-whether they are to be content with this defeat upom this great question of religious liberty, or whether there iE: any other course that can be adopted? (Hear, hear.) IthaGr: occurred to me that there is another course which can le.- adopted. The House is wel aware that it has been the de. clared and acknowledged law for twro centuries that perron3 in courts of justice may take oaths as witnesses, or in other capacities, in any form which is binding upon their cons sciences. Uponthe proposition of the late Lord Denman a. Bill was introduced, which becarae an Act of Parliamentri 1st and 2d of Victoria, cap. 105, bywhichaU persons in court,., of justice, upon any occasion, are permitted to make oath im any form that is binding upon their consciences, and an? person falsely swearing shall be liable to the pains and{ penalties of perjury. There is, however, an ambiguity in; the words " on any occasion," as to whether it is confined. to courts of justice or extends to higher authority. I propose. that the ambiguity shall be cleared up, and that it should bep declared to extend to the High Court of Parliament as welU as elsewhere " upon all occasions," that oaths may be ad. ministered by persons lawfully qualified- Sir H. WILLOUGHBY.-I rise to order. Is it compe,t tent to discuss a question upon the motion of adjournment,' when a notice of that very question stands on the paper oil the night? (Hear, hear.) Lord J. RlUSSELL.-I think it is competent for me to proceed. I may, if so disposed, conclude with a motios' that the House do now adjourn in order to enable the Go, vernment to declare what they intend to do upon a question, which aflects the right of members to sit in this House. (Hear.) Sir HL WI OlJUGHBY.-I submit the question of ordeit to the Speaker with all respect to the noble lord. A noticem of motion has been given by the noble lord to introdace. a Bill upon the subject of oaths, and it appears to me that: the noble lord is now discussing a question which will come on regularly at a later period of the evening. (Hear.) Mr. WALPOLE.-Perhaps I may be permitted to say X few words upon the point of order. I ratherthink, Sir,, your predecessor in the chair always laid down the rule that, although we have deviated widely from regularity in our proceedings upon this question of adjournment, yet he held: it was not competent for amemberto take advantage of this motion in order to speak upon any other snbject relating to which there was a notice of motion upon the paper of the evening. I mention this in order to put you, Sir, in n ndE of what has been the ruling in these cases. The noble lord, as I understand, is now adopting another course, and pro. poses, in order to put himself right, to move the adjoum. ment of the House, as an amendment on the motion that the Eouse at its rising adiourn toMondav. By so doingI be. lieve that the noble lord would boactin- strictly in accord. ance with the practice of the House, although he was not io order before; ;but I would venture to put it to the nobler lord, himself the greatest authority in this House, whethe he would not be ratherincreasing theirregularity into whiclh we have fallen by pumsuing the subject at this moment, (Hear, hear.) Mr. MILINS, who was met with some cries of " Oh . and " Order !" suid,-Nothing Is more clearly understec>. than that this is an order night. The noble lord has a no. tice upon the paper of a motion for leave to introdau-ea, Bill, and I am certain that many members have gone awkyunder the impression that it was impossible that that sIb. ject could be brought on until after the orders of the day bad been disposed of. (Hear, hear.) It wonld take these members greatly by surprise, and I believe also that iti would take the public greatly by surprse, if the noble lord were now to proceed with his BiL (Loud cries of "O -der" and " Chair !") The SPEAKER.-I believe that on the subject of order I might, in the first place, remind the House for a momont of the extreme inconvenience of the course which has beni pursued this evening. (Hear, hear.) A mnultiplici'ty oI questions haveboen dtscussed upon the one motion before the chair, that the House at its rising do adjourn till 2Mondaj next, and confusion in discussion is the result, which id greatly to be deprecated. (Hear, hear.) I believe, with rea spect to the question which has been addressed to mne by thu hon. member for Evesham, that no duty is more imperative on me than that of preserving the order of business, as it in laid down by the House for the day; and it certainly is may opinion that, as the noble lord has given notice of a motiorr for this evening, it is quite irregular, upon the motion that the House at its rising adjourn to Monday, to anticipate. that notice of motion, and to endeavour to take a discussio.z upon it. (Hear, hear.) Lord T. RUSSELL.-With respect to the point of order,. I may be permitted to say, vith arll deference, that in thu course of this evening different members on the other side of the slouse have entered into questions which properly belong to the Committee of Supply,, and which must be discussed there, and that my riglht hon. frieud the First Lord of the Admiralty, although he repre- hended the practice, immediately followed it, and went inteo along debate upon a subject which ought to have been re served for the Couittee of Supply. (Hear, hear.) As E have a practical object in view, however, from which 1 ehall not bo detorted, I shall make myself perfectly in order by naoving tle adiournment of the House. Tho practicah object which I have in view is to ascertain whether, in thee event of the House assenting to my bringing in the Bill o0: wbich I have given notice, the Pirst Lord of the Treasuryr will agree to set apart a day devoted to Govermment basi- ness on which it can be considered by the Honse. It iE obvious, unless that be done, and unless the day be an earl39 day, that there will be no chance of the Bill soing to tULZ inconvenience both to officers and men. f think, therefore, it would be a very unadvisable proceeding. We have the militia, with all the military oxperience they have acquired during the war, and if from any unfortunate course of events their services were required I am quite sure the shortest notice would be sufficient to bring them under armns in defence of the country. I must say, therefore, that I totally disagree with the hon. gentleman in his opinion that the country is devoid of proper defences, and I shall be quite ready to maintain my view whenever it may suit him to call attention to the subject. In reply to Sir H. WcLL.oUnGiY, The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER. said, therg had been some delay in preparing two or three of the items included in Estimate No. 7, but he believed the estimate was now in type, and would be in the hands of memberseto-morrow or on Monday. TIRE STATE OF INDIA. Lord J. RUSSELL.-The righthon.rnemberfor Buckinhamshire (Mr. Disraeli), instatinghis viewswith regard to the motion on Indian affairs, seemed to suppose that I had deprecated any discussion as tothe causes of therecent disturbances n India. I think it of theutmost importance that we should have a discussion and an inquiry with respect to the causes of those events; but at the present moment. from all we have heard, the troubles appear to have the character of a military outbreak. I think therefore the first thing to be done is to take sufficient means to put down the mutiny. (Hear, hear.) There must undoubtedly be a very serious inquiry afterwatds: but I own I doubt very much whether so early as next Friday or even Monday week it would be desirable to proceed with the discussion of the subject. We shaU at that time have accounts arriving with regard to which hon. members may take different views, and I do not anticipate any great advantage from so early a discusslon. RAILWAYS IN INDIA. Mr. WATKIN wisbed to bring under the notice of the Houre the subject of the formation of railways in India. He believed that if the arterial system of railways projected for that country had been carried out the mutiny which bad fecently occurred would have been promptly and completely suppressed, because the Government would have been enabled to concentrate upon particular points wheore disturbances broke out any ansount of force withdrawn from the peaceable districts. In 1843 the subject of estabishing railways in India wvas brought under the notice of the Indian Government, hut, although 14 years had beapedonl f8orle of raillway, including tramways, The, te sateofIndian finance might bo referredFto as a reason why railway undertakings had not been promoted in lndia. The Indian G}overnment would have acted wiser, too, if they had given a greater number of projects to a greater numnder of companies than they had done. Had the projected lines of railway been carried out he was almost certain that the disaster and difficulty now experienced in India would never have occurred. HIad a railway existed, for example, between Bombay and Delbi, troops could have been conveyed from the one place to the othor in three days. As matters stood, the jounzey could not be accomplished in lees than 30 days. (Eear, hear.) In 1818 the hon. member for Guildford, the chairman of the East India Company, stated in evidence before the committee that the Government of Indi.a itself ought to undertake the construction of railways if it was not done bv others, hut not more than 380 miles of railway had yet beenc formed. The hon. gentleman told them that the great difficulty lay in obtaining shipping to carry out the iron required for rails; but no such difficulty had been experienced in the case of America, to which, in the nine years ending 1856, we sent 2,100,000 tons of iron, a largo part of which was used in railways. There were no circumstancos to make railwvay construction more difficult in India than in America. LRnd and labour were cheaper in the former than in the latter country, and the materials were equally easy got in both. Ho need hardly refer to the influence of railways in cheapening the transit of goods, or point out the beneficial effect which such a mode of conveyance would have on the quality and price of cotton. The hon. member proceeded to show, in some detail, the slow progress made in the construction of the Great Indian Peninsula, the East Indian, and the Madras Railways, not-. withstanding guarantees of large 8ums of money given to the projectors in each case. HEc attributed the tardy dovelopmont of thc railway system in India to the deter. mined ressstasnco it had met with from the East India Company, and cited the testimony of Mr. IRobert Stephenson, the eminent engineer, in support of that position. The East India Company, he added, had chosen to confide the surveillance of their railways to military engineers, the effect of which had been to cramp and control the free energy of the commercial class brought to bear on their construction. He stated, in proof of this, that the milibary engineer appointed by the company to superintend the construction of the line from Calcutta, which proceeded in a north-weatward direction over an almost level tract of country, had refused to sanction a gradient of one foot in a thousand, and that the result had been that various embankments and cuttings had to be made at great expense which were wholly unnecessary. He (hMr. Watkin) ventured to predict that if all those absurd restrictions were removed, and if the East India Company would liberate the several companies, and permit them to carry out their undertakings in their own way and with the energy they could bring to the work-with the exception of a few places where difficult tunnels had to be constructed-two or three years would suffice for the completion of a magnificent system of rail. ways in India. He then read a statementmade by the military engineer of the Madras Railway, to show that the slow proegress of that line was attributable rather to a deficiency of bolts and other material appliances than to the want of native labour, which wascheap, docile;and easilyprocured, The Secretary of tho India Board was cx officio a member of all these railways boards, and he and the Board of Control and the Court of Directors had a veto upon all these pro' ceedings. Supposing the engineer of a railway company wanted matenal from England, the course of proceedings would be this,-he would apply to the agent, the agent would apply to the Government, the Government would refer to the consulting engineer, the conslting engineer would report to the Governor-General in Council; if approved the application would come back to the consulting engineer, and from the consulting engineer to the agent, who would then send it to the Court of Directors in London; the Court of Directors in London would send it to the consulting engineer in London; if he approved he would get tenders and send them to the Court of Directors, the Court of Directors would send them to the Board of Control, and from the Board of Control they would get back again to the Court of Directors. He believed that if joint-stock businesses in England or America were carried on under such a system of routine as that the word " progress" would cease to be known in either of those countries. (Cheers.) The ScindeRailway was an illustration of the effect of these obstacles. The project dated from three years ago. A capital of 333,0001. had been raised. Not a single sod was turned, and 218.0001. of the money was now in the coffers of the East India Company. The chairman of the railway company at the last meeting reported that they were waiting for the decision of the authorities as to the exact route. AU the reports of Indian railway companies proved that large amounts were in the hands of the East India Company, and other large sums were left unproductive, while only 358 miles of railway were opened, over which the Board of Control would, no doubt, sing a song of exultation to-night. (Hear, hear.) It was true that it was a mere practical question, but he would remind the House that mere practical questions had led to disasters in the Crimea, and that if this practical question had been settled only six months :,go they might have crushed the Indian mutiny in the bud. (Hoar.) He hoped that, as there was capital raised by bo'a lide shareholders, a competent staff of engineers upon the spot, and many useless because half-finished works, the House would come to the determination to lend its weight, authority, and direction to the immediate and speedy completion of these railways in India. (Hear.) He believed that aU that was required was that the system of obstractionasandinterference should be doneaway with, and that the East'India Company should apply the money as soon as they received it upon those important works, and not as a means of dealing favourably with their own finances. He believed that there were no practical difficulties, and that all the works could be completed within two years of tern. ing the first sod. It was a question not of a few thousand miles of rallway, but of thesecurityand possession of our Indian empire. He would therefore move, " That the slow progress of the East Indian railways involves danger to the military occupation of India, and retards the development of the industrial resources of that country." MIr. GILP,IN seconded the motion. Mr. V, SMITH hoped the House would not be led away from the question immediately before it (that the Speaker leave the chair in order to go into Committee of Supply) into a long discussion or Indian railways. He did not think the hon. gentleman was correct in saying it was a fit subject for the interference of the House. The Government had always considered it as a question',of private commercial enterprise; and, with regard to any impediments h the Court of Directors or the Board of Control, the House should recolleet the slight fact of the Indian Government guaranteeing 5 per cent. upon a very large outlay. Under those circumstances they would materially neglect their duty if they did not exercise some supervision over the expenditure of the money. In many instances it appeared that the railway companies contem. plated the cundrn f money in the most lavish masnner. and tne Indian Giovernmont were completely justified in' exercising the most minute supervision. The beginning of railways In India was in 1849, and the amount of capital upon which the Government had guaranteed interest was 30,230,0001. Nearly 1,000,0001. had been already expended. It was perfectly true that the Indian Government had declined to guarantee some smaller lines at present; and inthatjudgmentthe Government at home eltirelyconeurred. The means of conveying troops throughout the whole of India would undoubtedly be a great advantage at the present moment ; but the charge which had just been made against the Indian Geveronment by the hen. member for Yarmouth was inconsistent with the complaint preferred a few nights ago by the hon. member for Stockport, that.the Indian Government had devoted the railways in that countr to military and political, and not to oom- apurposes. The complaint of the hon. member for StoCkport might, perhaps, be fairly advanced against the Indian Government, hat that Government was not at aU open to the reproach of the heon member for Yarmouth. It had confined itself to tha. construation of certain trunk lines, and those lines bad made more rapid progress than was exhibited in the same time in England at the beginning of railways. So far from the Indian Government wishing to keep the money which had been lodged in their hands by the railway companies it would be only too glad if the companies would receive possession of it and sake the railways as fast as they could. The companies would have every assistance from him in the prosecution of theis undertaking. It was thtir own fault that so little progrems had hitherto been made. The impediments whicb the hon, member for Yarmouth said had been thrown in tiheir way arose fromn a proper supervision of an expenditw.e of iAiVi no amall pact vwas borne by the Indian Governnj,ent, but in all other respects the Governm ent was ready ta, alvr them to proceed at any pace they pleased, and, a' if.aras he was concerned, the more progress thoymnade Lthe I' et5;gr I(tb&XA4iat~ Covernmlent had undertaken to constrsact the railway i'self, complaint -might fairly have been made that it was not going fast enoug.h, but the coaStruction of the lies had been left entirely to private coupaxies, and it was their dnty to proceed as rapidly as they could. His own opinion was that if, at the commencement of the railways, there bad been a board of supervision to lcok after the whole of theta, and talke care that they were made more for the public adrantage than forprivate profit, a better stato of things would have existed now; isnt the appointment of such a board would have been met with a gzeat outory, arnd therefore the task of constructing Indian railwayshad been intrusted to private companies. Matters baving been so arranged he denied the position of the hon. member for Yarmonth, that any impediment had been throwa in the way of the private companies by the Indian Government, which, on the contrary, desired nothing more than the speedy completion oftherailways it had guaranteed to so largean anmount. He trusted that the hon. member would be content with that assurance and, without continu. ig the debate any further, would allow the House to go into Committee of Supply. (EIear, hear.) Mr. R. W. CRAWFORD said that, connected as he had been with the establishment of railways in India, and presiding as he now did over the East India way Company, he could not allow the present opportunity to pass without saying a few worAs upon the subject before the House, He thought that the attack which had been made upon the railway companies for the failure of their efforts to complete their works within a reasonable time was very unfair, The East India Railway Company was established for the purpose of constructing a line of about 1,100 miles in length. u 1849 it entered into a contract for that object with the East India Company ; in 1851 ibt was put into possession of the land, and in 1855 it opened 123 miles of railway-a rate of progress which might bear a favourable comparison with tho beat examples of railway enterprise inEngland. Nor was that all. So far from itS being true, as the hon. member for Yarmouth had stated, that no progress had been made beyond the 1'23 miles already opened, the company had at thepresent moment in active construction no fewer than 900 miles of railway, and during the couree of last year the large sum of 1,700,0001. was expended Upon the line, of which 523.0001. was laid out upon the permanent way and bridges. In addition to that the company had spent nearly a quarter of a millon in sending out rails and other heavy materials. (Hear, hear,) He did not think that the East India Company was in the slightest degree amenable to the charges which had been preferred agait it by the hon. member for Yarmouth; on the contrary, he believed that the success of the railway companies was owing in a great degree to the able and conciliatory maanner in which Sir James Melvill had exercised the supervision with which he had been intrusted by the East India Company. (Hear, hear.) At the same time ho admitted that the conduct of the local authorities in India was often not of the most judicious kind; but upon that and other topics connected with Indian railways he would reserve the observations which be wished to address to the House until the President of the Board of Control brought forward his annual budget. Mr. GILPINI said that the speech of the hon. member for Yarmouth had accomplished at least one good object-it had elicited from the President of the Board of Cortrol a statement which could not fail to be satisfactory to every member of the House. The right hon. gentleman had declared himself willing to give a full and fair course to private enterprise, and if that were done there was every reason to expect that the railways of India would be pushed forward with as much vi.our as those of other countries. In 1853 the Canadian Lelature passed a Bill for the formation of the Grand Trunk Railway, and in about three years afterwards 853 miles were opened for traffic. He hoped the hon. member for Yarmouth would not press his motion to a division, but would rest satisfied with the explanation of the President of the Board of Control. He must 4dd, it was not quite fair to compare the zate of progress in the construction of railways in India with that mn Enland, for in the latter case we commenced an entirely newv and untried siystem, while in regard to India there was the experience of 30 years and the talent of the mostshUled engineers to a;d them. Colonel SYKES wished there had been before the House a detaUed statement of facts and figures in regard to Indian railways, in which case they would have been spared much vague discussion. Mr. AYRTON thought the conduct of the Indian Government recently had improved in respect to the formation of railways. The 280 miles of railways already constructed was no criterion of the rate of progress, for he found that, in addition, 1,000 miles were in course of construction besides aboat 2,000 miles more for which surveys had been made. It couild therefore hardly be said that the Indian Government had been remniss in their conduct regarding railways. If there were to be too rapid a construction of railroads it would create and congregate a class of labourers at high wages who, when the demand for their labour ceased, would be placed in circumstances of great distress. Mr. PLATT thought the progress of railways could not be said to have been too rapid. As that questiou was intimately connected with the supply of cotton, which was of great importance to his constituents, he wished to mention a few facts concerning it. The GreatIndianPeninsula Railway was brought under the notice of the Indian Board in 1844, a Bill was brought in in 1845, but was defeated in consequence of the opposition of the East India Company. It remained in aboyance until 1848. The contracts were made in 1849, and now in 1857 only ES miles were open for traffic. The evidence given before the select committee showed that the great obstacle to the supply of cotton from India was the want of means of commumcation betvreen the producing districts and the seacoast. If good roads were made we should receive cotton, and in return find a market for our manufactured articles. Our exports of cotton goods amounted to about 38,000,0001. a-year, but it must be remembered that we were paying about 10,000,0001. a-year more for our cotton than we ought to pay, and that increased price caused our exports to seem of larger amount than they actuaUly wero. At present the manufacturing interest of Lancashire was in an unsatisfactory condition, and the difference between the prices of cotton and of manufactured articles was less than it had ever been before. That aose not from an actual decrease in the supply of cotton, but from the consumption increasing in greater proportion. TheHou3emastremember that seven-eighths of the cotton consnmed in this country was supplied by the United States, where the slave labour wich produced it only increased very slowly, and the consequence had been that slave labour there had risen about 100 per cent. in value within the last few years. Although Africa and some other places might be looked to for cotton, yet India was the quarter whence a supply ought particularly to be obtained. Very great anxiety-almost alarm-was felt by many of our manufacturers at the present scanty supply of cotton. He believed that that anxiety was weU founded, and that the only way of escaping from the difficulty was by connecting the cotton districts in India with the coast by means of railways, and by proceeding with works of irrigation, which, as the East India Company was the landlord of that country, it ought to undertake. Mr. WILLOUGHBY said that it was not unntl the 31st of October, 1850, that an attempt was made to introduce railways into India, and therefore not 14, as had been represented by thehon. member forYarmouth, butmerely six and ahalf yearshad elapsed since that workwas actually con. menced. 20,000,0001 of capital had been already raised to carry on that work, and it was intended to raise 10,000,0001, more. He believed that during the next six and a half years a greater extent of railway would be opened than during the past six and a half years. He believed that the system on which the Indian railways were being constructed was much more perfect than any other, because it combined the energies of the private capitalist with the control and authority of a disinterested Power-but he ought not to say a disinterested Power, because it was interested in the speedy construction of railways in India. If the people of England had had the good fortune to have had their railway enterprises controUed by a similar kind of government interference they would not now have to lament that the average profit of railway shareholders was 31. 12s. nd. (Hear, hear.) The amendment was then negatived without a division, and the House went into committee, SUPPLY. THE PEMSIANT WAR. On the vote of 500,0001., to defray the expenses of the Persian war, being put fromn the chair, The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER rose and said, -Although the debate of last night related to the procedure of the Government on the subject of the Persian war, and did not relate directly to the policy of that war, yet before the debate closed that subject received so much discussion that the whole evening was devoted to it. The committee, therefore, will perhaps hardly wish me to ask their attention to any detailed exposition of the accounts upon which I ask for this vo"e. (Hear, hear.) I wil then merely state that tho view which Hler Majesty's Government have taken of the Persian war has been that it was mainly a war to maintain the independence of the town of Herat. That view was entertained by a succession of previous Governments, who regarded it as a recognized prineiple, and treated it as a cardinal object of Asiatio or Oriental policy. Seeing, then, that the independence of Herat was threatened, and that the town was actually occupled by Persian troops, they felt justified in instructing the Indian Government to send an expedition to the Gulf of Persia, followfng in that respect a course which had previously been rewarded with success in a like state of CircumstanCes. I will not trouble the House by rediscussing the pohey of this war. I will merely say that were it not for the existence of our Indian possessions the occupation of Herat by Persia would be a matter wholly unimportant and insignificant to this country. It would not more directly concern English interests than a conquest effected in the centre of Africaby the Kingdom of Timbuctoo or of Dahomey. It is only in consequence of our possessions in India that the town of Herat is of importance to us. BIer Majesty's Government, therefore, would have been justified in following the precedent of tbh former war inA'ghanistan by imposing the whole expense of that -war upon the Indian treasury. looking, however, to the general policy of Asia and to the circumstances of general interest which characterire the expedition to the Persian Gulf, the Government felt justifed in undertaking to repay to the Indian Government the hal of the extraordinary expensea of thewar, leaving itto Parliament tosanction that arrangement. I need scarcely say tbatthe undertaking of the Government could only be conditional upon the assent of Parliament being subsequently obtained. Therefore, of course, with regazd to the financ3al part of the subject, the view which was taken was this, that the war should be carried on by an expedition from Bombay, and that the expense of that expedition hFould be defrayed by the Indian wreasury. It now becomes our duty, if the House should be prepared to ratify the engageanent entered into on bebalf of the Govex4ment, to repay to the Indian treasury one-half of the eztraordInary expenses of the war. No time 15 fixed for repayments of that sort to take place. And I may here observe that at this moment there I1 a oonsiderable unsettled account for the China war whieh was concluded maany years ago. (Laughter and odes gof " hWjhear,'") <,ttiZ t the duty ol my hon, friend the Secretary to tbh Treasury before thi6 committee is clo3ed to ask this House to agree to a vote for the remaininu account with respect to the old China war. That involves an adjustment of accounte, inasmuch as the East Ind.a Company owes the Government a asi equal to the nmoney due on that account. Never' tf'less, it is a fact that that account has not been finally adjrusted, and can only be brought to a conclusion by a vote' of tbisEHou6e. Early in the session, before I was able to obtain any urecise view of the probable cost of the war, I stated t!sat'L thought it would be sufficient to repay to the East Indi;a Comp,ny a sum of, I think, 365,0001. for the expenses of the war at the Persian Gulf. At that time I was unable to antcipatfe the probable durtion of the wvar, and the estmate was taken at that low amount. Subsequently we have been enabled to obtain from the East India Company the probable estitnate of the ultimato total expenses 'ef the war. But I may state to the House that that is stiMl only -an estimate, Inasmuch as the accourts have not been made out, and the Company is not yot in posses7ion of tbe final cost of the war. A short time ago I received from the East India Company an assurance tbat ifthesum of 500,0001. werep aid in the course of this session that woulad beas anumLh as would be needed for the wants of the treasury of the Company, and accordingly I have laid upon the table an estinnate to that amount. The total sum which will ultitnately be due to the East India Company on this account will, however, exceed 5M00(. The estimnate on the table exhibits a total of 1,86O000L, one-half of which, according to the present engagement is due by our Exchequer to the East Indla Company, mak'ing therefore a sum somewhat exceeding 900,0001. Tihe anount which I proposed to vote to the East India Company this seesion was 500,000L, leaving a balance, ac3ording to this estimate, of abnut 400,0001. Butsince this estimate waslaid on the table I have had a communication from the Chairman of the East India Company, stating that the late advices received from India with regard to the loss of xaoney from their treasuries, together with the probable intcrruntion which the collection of the revenue may sustain, ws render it convenient that a larger sum should, with the consent of the House, be voted on this acoount in the present session. Therefore, I merely mention that all I ask the commnittee to grant thisevening on this account is a sum of 500,0001. Bat I think it not improbable that Itoay feel it my duty to present a supplementary estimate to the extent of 300,000. or 400,0001., in order to rey to the East India Company the whole of the money they have advanced on this account. It may be convenient that I X ould explain to the committee at the same time the other vote which I have to propose,-viz., a vote of credit for the militarjandnavaloperationsiuChina. TheHonsehasalready bee, informed that orders have been sent out to Singapore to divert from their destination, Hongkong, a portion of the regiments despotched to that station, and, indeed, that Lord Canning had anticipated the intentions of the Government by addressing a letter to Lord Elgin on that subject. We therefore expect that a considerable part of the military force destined for Cbina will now be diverted to India; and under these circumstances aportion of theexpenses of those regiments wiU faU not upon the English, but upon the Indian treasury. The committee are aware tha,t when the Queen's troops are required by the East India Company for service in India their expense is defrayed by the finances of that country. Therefore, I shall not find it necessarv to ask the House to agree to so large a sum as 500,0001. as a vote of credit for the China service. I shaU ask only for 400,0001., which I believe wil be an!cient both for the extraordinary naval and military services upon that station, and instead of asking for 100,0001. for the China service my right hon. friend at the head of the Admiralty has laid on the table a supplementary vote of 98,0001. for the navy. So thatthe 100,0001. which will be taken from the China vote will appear in the shape of a supplementary estimate for the naval service; but the total sum for the two votes will not be exceeded. Having explained these two votes to the committee, I may be permitted to remark that exaggerated apprehensions seem to exist as to the probable pressure upon the English Exchequer from the recent occurrences in India. It would, of course, now be premature to anticipate the consequences of those events, either in a political orin a financial point of view. But, whatever additional military force may be furnished to India is a burden upon the Indian treasury, and its cost will not be borne by England. As at present advised, we do not look forward to the necessity of calLing on this House to incur any additional expenditure on account of the military reinforcements sent to India. I understand it Is supposed that it may be requisite to make great demands on the English Exchequer for this purpose; but at present I do not anticipate any such necessity. It would, of course, now be vain to speculate as to the future ; but as now advised Her Majesty's Government do not contemplate the probability of ask-ing the House this session to agree to any additional estimates beyond what I have just stated,-viz., 500,0001. for thereEayment to the East India Company of the expenses of the Persian war; possibly a further grant of 300,0001. or 400,0001. for the same serrice; a vote of credit for the China service of 400,0001.; andI a supplementary naval estimate of IOD,OOO.' I do not apprehend that beyond these charges there will be any occasion to call on this House for increased funds on account of the late occurrences in India. Having given these explanations with respect to the charges upon the exchequer of this country. it is now my duty to show that there are ways and means to meet those additional charges, inasmuch as the expenditure which I am asling the House to sanction is considerably in excess of the estimate of revenue made by me in the month of February last. I think I can satisfy the committee that the Exchequer will furnish ample provsion for these exigencies. The estimate which I gave of the expenditure for the financial year ending on the 1st of April iast exceeded what turned out to be the actual expenditure by no less a sum than 1,860,0001. That is to say, takig the excess of the receipts of last year, together with the decrease of the actual expenditure below the amount I had anticipated, there wv,as a gain to the public beyond my calculations of 1, 860, 0DO1 This includes both the excess in the revenue and the diminution in the expenditure. In addition to this sum there has been a gain upon tea, coffee, and sugar in the last quarter beyond the amount at which I estimated these branches of the revenue of about 500,0001. The fall in the duties which took place on the 1st of April last caused the holders of those articles to retain them in bond until the reduced scale came into operation. This has thrown a receipt of about half a million more than I reckoned upon into the returns for the last quarter. Since that period the malt duty has likewise been more productive than theoRevenue Department estimated it to the extent of half a million. Therefore, up to the present time the Exchequer is richer than I calculated it would ob when I made my financial statement in February last by the sum of 2,860,0001. Against this sum there are certain charges by way of set-off which were not estimated by me in the beginning of last session. Those cbarges are :-Tho Sound Dues Redemption, 1,135,000l.; the addition to my estimate for the Persian expeditiou, 235,0001,, the naval and milltary operations in China, 400,0001., the supplementary vote for the navy, 100,0001. ; and the Princess Royal's dowry, which was not estimated, 40,0001. These sums added togeither malce 1,910,0001., to which I addI a further sum of 300,0001. for the remainimg expenses of the Persian expedition. This gives a total of 2,210,0001., against a gain of 2,860,0001. The committee will therefore see th- t the Exchequer is in a condition to meet the charges for which I ask them now to provide. I would also call attention to the fact that the state of things which I have indicated is actually realized. It does not depend upon estimate. And it would not be unreasonable to expect a gain upon some branches of the revenue beyond that which I have estimated for theremaining portion of the year. Under these circumstances I trust inthechairman's hands, (Hlear.) plc MIr. WALPOLE wished to remind the right hon. gentle. man that in the debate last night the probable estimate of the Persian expedition was stated to be 265,0001., which was the proportion to be borne by the British Treasury in the current half-year. He doubted, then, whether that estimate would not be exceeded, and whether the expenditure would not be 900,0001. This was a very important fact, which the Government ought to have ascertained from the East India Company before the statement made last night on this subject. (Hear.) He confessed he was rather puzzled to know the exact computation on which the East India Company or the Government made their estimate. Iu the accounts of the East India Company presented to Parliament on the 18th of Junie, 1857, there appeared an estimate of receipts and expendituro ini the home treasury of tho East India Company during the year from May 1, 1857, to April 30, 1858, in 'which the East India Company took credit for only 250,0001. as the moiety of clarge coming from the British Govemarnent towards the Parsia. expedition. Some explanation was due on this subjec't (Hear.) The etimate laid upon tho table for the China war was 500,0001. Now, if that China war were to,be pro. secuted for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction vwhioh the Governzmnent thought due to this country, and if tho Government considered that 500,0001. was necassr for that purpose last week, he should be sorry that the Government should hamper itzelf by taking a smaller sum merely because they wanted another 100,0001. for India. (Hear.) The Goverament knew best whether they wanted that sum.of 600,0001. or not, but if it were wanted he boped they wouldnot cripple themselves in the endeavour-o get tho satisfaction due to this country. Although he wholly, disareed with the Government in their policy . China (hear, hear), he thought that if the Government onco emobarked in such a matter the credit and homour of this counn try were at stake unless they obtained the reparation to which they were entitled. With regard to t'a navy estimate of 100,000L to defray the expenso of se,iirag troops to India, he believed it wotld not so ar,i'a, aflect the British Treasury as the East India Company. In addition to 1,000,0001. for the Persian expedition there would be a great expenditure to be borne for putting down the unfortunate mutiny in Indi A. If he remembered aright, the East India Company bad at this moment an expedtrbigher than their reckipts by very nearly 2,000,0001, According to the figur es now before the House there vouliabe a charge of somne- thing between 3,000,0001. 3nd 4,000,0001. uponi the fuanie-s of the East India Cormpany over the probable receipts, which the Company had to meet those charges. The (,fiaacellor of the Exchequer thought that there would 1,e no further demand upon the Treasury of this country for the expenses which would necessarily have to be i ,cnrred in India, but before the committee assented to this vote it would be necessary for them to be safe in thCfp. conclusions. Unless he was mistaken, it would be r ,ecessry to allow something more than the Chancellor of 'ebe Exeheuer had done for the expense of those great oP' ,rations which the Government might have to meet, for tl e East India Company mright not be able to bear them. 'Ao did not wish to raise any controvorsial 9nesti-,~n at the present monnent, ortoeripplethe hasnes ofne Governmuent, but the committee ought to know ySjas essihe what further expenditure was likely to be tunic by this country, For himself, laQ did4 llog

LOPDO2,? SA2BDAYy, JULY18, 1857. In the Mlouse: of Lords last night Lord flouonrA, in a speech which rominded his audience-of the old days of the Anti-Slavery debates, proppsed an Address to REn MJzTYr, praying that she would give no encouragement to the scheme of imiporting Africans to her own tropical dominions; and would use her influence with her allies to.diseountenance any such project. Lord CLA.aNDON, in reply, expressd his entire concurrence in the Address, and described the course Twihoh the Government had taken in their negotia-. tion with France, which had always protested ita determination to prevent its fiag from, being pro3ti-. tuted by anything like a traffiia slaves. Lord Manc'ssBuny did not believe that an emi-. gration from Africa necessarily included arevival of t,he slave trade, and 'cited the example of the Kroomaen, who were always willing to erinOrate. Lord HAusiowBy replied, and, after a few words from Lord BROUIHASt, the Address was agreed to. After come formal business, their Lordships adjourned. The HIouse of Commons, at a morning sitting,was oeupiea in committee with the remaining clauses, of .the. Lunatics (Scotland) Bill and.the early clauses of the Burial Acts Amendment Bdl. . In the evening, on the motion that the House at its rising do adjourn until Monday, a conversation. arose, originating in a question put by Lfad BuRGcUEY to Mr. Hons-araw, the chairman of the Bath Election Comniittee, with' reference to his, adjournment of that committee . over Thursday, which was acquiring some degree of acrimony when it was put a stop to, though with difflculty,. by * Sir J. PANrGTONI putting a question to the Secretary of the Treasury on the subject of a regulation, restricting the distribution of papers to members. 1r.~ Wnsox gave the required explanation.' Admiral Dux-conEn 'called the attention of the First Lord of' the Admiralty to the policy of reconsidering the determination announced by him not to employ any of the screw line-of-battle ships in conveying a portion of the troops about to be sent to India. Mr. BBNT1NCx, referring to former answers of Sir' 0. WooD and Lord PArmisToN, observed' that by their admissions the country was left in a defenceless state by sea and land. Sir Ci WOOD remarked that the state of the.defences of the country by land and seawas a question .of too great'inportance to be raised incidentally, and, in reply to Admiral DuNcoisxu, he said'the Admiralty had arrived at their coiclusion not-without due consideration, and he did not think that a reconsideration of the subject would alter their determination, the grounds-of which be tated very fully, entering into many details, Lord J. RUSSELL, with reference to a notice he had given of a motion for that evening, for leave to bring-in a Bill to amend the Act I and 2 of VICTOIurA, cap. 108, "to remove doubts as to the validity of ceitain oaths," adverted to- the embarrassing state of the questiorn as to t'he admission of Jews into Parliament, and observed that a mnode of escape might be found by removing an ambiguity in that Act, which permitted oatlis to be taken in courts of Justice, and "on any occasion' whatever," ii the I form most binding on the conscience of the party taking the oath, so that it might- apply to oaths taken by members of Parliament. Lord Jour was here called, to order by Sir, H. WmLouo=Y ; and, after a discussion of this point, The SPEAKER noticed the great inconvenience of discussiDg a variety of subjects upon a motio' that the House at its rising should adjourn till Monday, which created a confusion, he said, greatly to be deprecated. His opinion was that, as] Lord J. RussIsLr had given notice of a motion for that evening, it was not regular to anticipate its discussion. Lord J. RussEr thereupon "put himself in' order" by moving that the House should then adjourn, and proceeded to say that lae had a practical object in view-namsely, to ascertain, whether, supposing the House assented to the introduction of his Bill, Lord PALinsBRSTON would set apart an early day for considering it; otherwise there was no chance of its passing the House of Lords. Before this question was answered, Mr. GRtIFFIr called attention to the project of a ship canal through the Isthmus of Suez. Lord PAnLuEsuSTON, in reply to Lord J. RusS}fnzs question, said veryiimpoktant matters, affecting the interests of the country, were before the House, and its days being numbered it was impossible to fix a- day for the discussion of the Bill. In answer to Mr. GUarFiTii, he repeated what he had stated on'a former evening regarding the sebeme in question, that if was physically impracticable, except at an enormous cost, and that it-was highly objectionable - in a political point of view with reference to the security of our Indian possessions and our settled polcy to prevent the separation of Egypt 'from Turkey. Mr. R. STrE'nNsow was of opinion, upon scientific and engineering grounds, that the scheme was undesirable. The motion for immediate adjournment was withdrawn. .I. Mr.. DLsRELr asked Lord PAwtsRsTox to appoint some day to discuss the afairs of India, so as to arve at a conclusion as to the causeS of the great calamities there, and whether the means prepared by the Government were adequate to the occasion. He gave notice that he should make a motion upon the subject that day week. Lord ALESTON suggested Monday week, which would be after the arrival of the next maiL Mr. DISBA assented. The motion for adjournment till Monday was then agreed to. Onthe raotion of Mr. FIGHAm, the chairman of the Lamb-th Election Committee, JosrHP TszDruE, in custody of the Serjeant-at-Arms, was ordered to be discharged on payment of his fees. On -the order for going into a Committee of Supply, Mr. BSmeNy repeated his observation respecting the state of the national defences. Lord PARLwmTox said the country was perfectly provided with defences against any emergency that might arise. Mr.' WATmm moved a resolution, " That the slow progress of the East Indian railways involves danger to the-military occupation of India, and retards the development of the industrial resources of that country." Hle complained that these useful works were impeded by the interference of the East India Company and their absurd- restrictions, urginog that, had the proposed arterial communications been completed4 the mutiny might have been prevented or crushed in the bud. He believed this to be a question of the security and the possession of India. Mr. V. Srnr, in reply to the motion, said that when Mr.WATSKi spoke of the impediments thrown in the way of railways in India by the Government, he must-recollect that the Indian Government had guaranteed 5 percent. upon the capital subscribed, and they were tberefore bound to exercise some supervision . over the manner in which the money was expended, and it had appeared to them that there had been-some squandering of money in these undertakings. He denied that the Indian Government was at all open to reproach in this matter. In the trunk lines the progress had been rapid. Mr. CRAwronrD contended. that Mlr. WATn- had no foundation for. the charges he had made against the railway companies and the Indian Government. The debate was contixaued by Mr. C. GinrN, Colonel S=xs, Mr. AnxuoN, Mr. PLAr, and Mr. The resolution was negatived, and the House went into Commnittee of Supply. The CH"mieaoR of the * ExHiTQUuR, in -moving a re3Olution granting 500,0001. towards reimbursing the East India Compauy a moiety of -the expenses of the'Persaian war, 'stated the Iview- whicL the Government haad taken of the war,-that it was mainly to miaiiiin 'the iidepe'ndence of lieiat) and, loo.king to the general politics of Asia, they had felt' themselvesijustified, he said, in undertaking to pay to the Indian Government balf of 'the extraordinary expenses of the wai, conditional on the assent 6f Parliament. There wouldb'e a further' .vote for 'a payment' to 'the East India Coopany' on accoont of the laat.

After a amart and somewhat angrydiscussion, and repeated divisions, Lord J. Russaum withdrew his motion, and the House adjourned at half-past 4 o'clock.
The i9th century, though it is getting rather old, is stiU a very grand era. None yet so egotisticaL . It has its crusades and its heroes; its sacred causes and its grand principles, its wonderful discoveries, its institutions, its philanthropy, its, eonscience, and everything that the vorld never heard of before. But all the time it is incapable of doing many. a simple thing. There is hardly a bit of' common aepse or common h'umanity to which.there are not now' iusuperable objections, though formerly it 'was done at once without a thought, aid answered very well. It is just such A matter that elicited a vast of obstructive 'ingenuity and elou Iast night itlhe Lords. Our neighbours across the Channel are takng, steps for .the free importation of 'Africans into their West Indian plantations, with secpity for their free employment, sufficient. wages, and liberty of return. Well. %hy should they=not? Why should not we'do the sine? A1 the bra'd fcts f the case are in favour of the proposal.,_ The experiment has been tried by several Powers with the East Indian Coolies, sonie hundred thousands of whom have been' imported from an immbnse distance to the West Indies, and it has answered even beyond expectation. They are carried across two oceans with fair average safety, health, and comfort. They make estates profitable that did. not pay expenses for 3nany years before. They work hard, and almnost invariably return with a pocketfull of money, which they make a better use of than most labourers or gentlemen's servants do of their savings in this country. Not a word c,n now be said against a process which, natural as it seems, was loudly protested against only a few years ago. There are hundreds of most excellent and enlightened philanthropists who ten years ago were denouncing the traffic in Coolies as even more monstrous, dangerous, and wicked than that in Negroes. Indeed, the distance was greater, the risks worse, the race weaker and more gentle, and the novelty itself a new wickedness on the face of the earth. fancy inveigling a poor, despised, weak-minded, ignorant pariah from the Ganges to the West Indies, with a promise of a safe return and a comfortable old age ! Indeed, it was hard to fancy it, because some of the most confident.prophets ever known in the sacred history of our country predicted most positively that it would, never be, and that the results would be horrible. The results, however, have been quite as,good as the results of most of our own philanthropical and sanitary legislation. It has answered, and the mouths of all adversaries have been stopped. Then comes the obvious question,What is good for dark men, why is it not also good for black men.? If there can be aa honest, free importation, across two oceans, why not also across only one? If three months out and three months return are not impossible, where is they impossibility of one month out and one month back? All the circumstances of climate and physical constitution are 'in favour of the 'Afri-. can Negro as compared with the Hindoo or the Chinaman. Indeed, this w 'as never disputed. There' was only a dangerous sort of aptitude, a fatal speciality, for pIantation work in the African. The more fit he was fcr it the more should he be vrotected from it. This is the side ably advocated by that distinguished representative of the intentions' and failures of the last generation, Lord BRoUGA4F, last night. Of course, it is only too intelligible that the worthy men who extinguished Slavery .and ruined our We'st India possessions should be very touchy, very, obstinate, vqry inconvertible on, that very texder point. -It.is not, gr business to deny. thein niuchljustice.and truth on their:side, or,to. stand np fori the planters, who took a line which. repIlled.l reasonable advocacyt B3at, confesly takng t'hat grand sumnary view of the quetion. which we cannot help taking after a quartes of s century, theprocess wa afailure; *it destroyed. p ~nimrens9 property, ruined thousands, of gopd .famillies, .dFeg,raAed the Negroes still lowYer .thap they were, and. after. all, increased the inass of Slave yin less scFupi1ois hands. Afer maany attempts ,at indirect disaouragement, we have been'obliged at last to 1ecognie and .admit pers#i en siaveowners to an equag' rank. in our conrrerce. Everybody who cpmes fresh-into .the auestion uncompromised En4 ipnbiased, admits the failure, and ass why e didnatattemptgradualorapontsnequsemanopatJ0u if it was, indeed, utterly impossible toimprove the practice, of Slavery into something more like 'that we read of in Sacred as wellasClassical ant'iquity. The more these questions are asked, 'anA .the mor. these- doubts .abound, th, more positvq are the men .of the.past ,thattheydidright i~n ,their days, and that they cannot be improved upwn i: our days. So, Lord BRouGHAi takes his Btand broadly and boldly on the utter impossibily of conveying the African across the Ati+atin dmaer auy conditions or any -securities, ;,Without bringing baci all the harrorp of kidnay.jpngj of internal African wars. for .the acquisition .gfslaves, andof hopeless, unmitigated Slavery on tfh;,opther side. -With the almost unanswerable difl.cilty of the,successfulCoolie iuni,gratioa staring n *n the face, he is reduced to defy all genieral ru]esj and rest ,hAis case, Qn tha most marvellous ,and jincredibla Bpecialities applying only to the case of the African.'. Tle fr,st of these special circu,mstances, said to take thq proposal of a free.African immigration out of. the sphere of common rules and common serse, is the, Negro's alleged horror of the Aea. Why everybody,bas a horror' of the.sea.~ .7'obody. contemplates the passage from Dover to Calais without the most horrible antici-~ pations. AU- Englishmen Xand Englishwomeni hate the sea;, the Yankees still more; the French. still :more; the Germans atill ,morec; JTows +tl moror; Tturks still more; and the Ilind9os most of all. , It is. tbe one' firt- condition made by the* Indiau ,S,poy that he -is not to be carried. I by, sea against his will. He has a 'religious as well' as a physical horror of it. No doubt; the -sea is a horrible thing, and it must be 'particularly, horrible to people with simple natural habits. But, as in the old epigram a man is made to run into the sea when pursued by' a ilad beast,, snthese days a large .portion of the humanl raco a'nnua7^1y rush to the' sea, horrible. as it i,to escape he. still more horrid gripe of, starvation,.or some other horror as bad. Thq Africans are always ready to work for short 'v,oyages; indeed, they would- be ready enough to ,tAke longer ones if they felt. sure that, they 'would not be final, and -that after a fair period. of service. they might be all owed to return with their savings. A few hiuidred of their countryme. returning 'safe and sound 'with plenty of mon,ey and' ,a, good account of' .their time -would teJ, on the "'ative imagination and greatly diminish the horrors of the sea; What measures the French may choose to take for obtaining' emigrants. we' need not inquire, ,but we cannot implicitly credit stories of bloody wars wvgedl far in the interior for the sole purpose of ac4uiring vast bodies of captives, bO :be eola for 9s. a-piece at the coast. If this operation is worked to advantage, we beg 'to 'suggest that 'the Commissariat officers employea shall be engaged for the us6 of our own soldiers. Of couifse, they will contract to meet all. 'the expenditure of. our wars °R consideration of receiving '9s." head nmoney on every-Tprisoner of war, If this African story is true, they ought to grow rich' by the contract, though we don't ourseves see how it cain bo done. As for the other supposed. specialities of -the case, the impossibility of distinguishing between a cargo. of voluntary ,ad of enforced' emigrants, and the impossibility of securing for the Negro wagpes, liberty, and.a retura at-the end of his time, we have only to 'ask whether the African is less able to speak for ' himself and 'vindicate his rights than the Cooae; or whether there will be more mystery about the life and fortune of the one than the other. In our colonies, at least, it will always be easy to get at. the Negro immigrant, and to give him a ready tribunal for the publication of his wrongs, in 'case of any cruelty or fraud.. As for what other Powers can or will do, that will be their own affair, as,., indeed, it is already. We are only concerned with our own people.
On tha strength of a high authority the Governmtntio'ftbis' country.generally acquiesces in the say3Ong' a great nationl should not cairy on a little;war; but unfgrtunately it is as often unwilling at'the commencement of a struggle to own that WDt are carrying on a war at all. What ought we'to'think of this Indian Mutiny ? What do foreignhnations actually think of it? To all theIworld it seems a matter of the gravest consequence. MIany millions of human beings and an armed body of 250,000 met are controlled by only a few Commissioners and %Collectors, suppoited *by some thousands of Europ4an troops. If the revolt of which we have received the details, should spread-if every spot not held by British troops were to be wrested from British power-if traveLing and the telegraph were to be everywhere' interrpted and the EuropeanRegimenti in danger of being starved in their quarters, surely the situation could be called nothing but a state of war; and yet these calamities may be realized at any hour. In fact, the Empire is truly carrying on hostilities. The doings in India are a social or a servile war, according to the light in which we -view the Sepoys who have rebelled. It is the most arduous and the most discouraging kind of war, for in it neither glory nor territory is to be gained,' nor increase of influence, nor increase of wealth. India, the conquest of tho century which ends this year, has now to undergo a second and final subjugation. The nation will do well to consider it as noew ground on which everything has to' te done over again. And, indeed, vhere can it be said that the British influence has not been shaken ? Do we know enough of 31ahomedans and Hindoos and their ways to say that in any station, from the Indus to Rangoon, the belief in our weakness and our imminent fall has not penetrated? The Mtutiny has broken out without suspicion on the part of hundreds of officers whose whole lives have been devoted to the superintendence of Asiatics. As the rulers of India have been so completely surprised by the late events, why'should not others happen for which they are equally unprepared? They believed in the greased cartridges, of Barrackpore up to the moment when the ivhole Army for 1,500 miles was in a flame. The, same limitation of view, the sarDe undue secuiity, may be found again. Ought Parliament and the people of England to measure their exertions by the reports of Indiau officials, when it has been: proved that there exists among Asiatics an understanding and a power of co-operation vwhich years of service do not enable an European to detect? Thqrefore, without being alarmists, without beliqving in the power of any mumber of Sepoys to resist the charge of European troops, we would urge' Government not to fall again into theerror of 1854,. and to refuse to believe in war until it becomes disaster.

HosrrrAI FOr DiSABLEX MEmcRAMiT S3En.-Au. influential meeting was held yesterday in the Egyptian-ball, at which the Lord Mayor presided, to promote the formation of- hospital foraged andi disabled master mariners and seamen o the mercantile marine. Many naval officers of haigh rark -were present. The Lord Mayor, having adverted to the importapce of the object in view, Lord EZcnry Cholsiondeley read a statement from the Board of tianagekient of the Shipwrecked Mariners' Society, going at some length into the subject, and recommending that there should boa hospital founded for O00 men, and that & plan should be adopted for giving out-pensions as a part of the institution. Captain the Hen. F. Mande, R.N., then moved a resolation in favour of the formation of such a hosnital as Was contemplated.

SECOND EDITION. THE TIMES-OFFICB, SatuWrday Moinqg. EXPRESS FROM PARIS; The foUowing is the letter of our Paris correrpondent, dated yesterday (Friday), 6 p.m.:- The great event of this day Is the funeral of the p et, or, as the French love to call him, and as he loved to call himself, the chanmonnier, Bdranger. After a tedious imness, he expired last evening at half-past 5 o'clock, and his funeral obsequies took place this day at 12. The law, I believe, requires that 24 hours at least shall elapse between the demise and the interment; but a declaration of urgency, signed by two or three physicians, may authorize an exception to that regulation, and in the present instance I think the exception was not ill founded. For some days past it was reported that 'the Democratic party would profit by the death of Beranger to make what is called a pactio demonstratin. Every one knows what such a tiemonstration means, and that it is often anything ibut pacific in its origin or its consequences. The " demonstration" at the funeral of General Lamarque, in June, 1832, was also declared to be pacific, but before his remains were deposited in the earth the terrible struggle of the Cloitre St. Mery had begun and the streets of Paris were flowmng with blood. There can be no question that the late elections have considerably raised the hopes of the Republican party; the electors who nave returned to the Legislative Corps General Cavaignac and his former colleagues seem to be regarded by t "at party in the light of an army already embodied awd disciplined for the combat, whene.ver the propitious moment comes. The authorities, it is said, had received information of some " demonstration" being contemplated, and that the populace would muster strong on the occasion, less to do honour to genius and patriotism, as personified in B6ranger, than to watch for an occasion for a collision. The Government determined to anticipate those plans, if plans there were. It was announced in the columns of the Monite,ur this morning that the funeral of Bdranger should be public, at the expense of the civil list, and that every honour that could be paid to one who so long stood prominent before the world, and whose name is dear to the French people, should be rendered to him. By doing so the Emperor effected a double object-the same display which honoured the genius of B6ranger would at the same time prevent disoDrder and maintain the tranquillity of the capital. Th3 obsequies, as I have said, took place at 12 o'clock. In conformity with the express wiU of the deceased, and the arrangements umade by the municipal administration, official deputations, and those to whom letters of invitation were sent, were alone permitted to be present at the religious ceremony, which took place in the church of St. Elizabeth-duTemple, and to form part of the cort6ge to the cemetery of Pire-la-Cha1se, where the remains of the poet are now deposited. Those arrangements were announced this morning, not only in the Moniteur, but also by means of placards posted throughout Paris. From an early hour immense crowds thronged the Boulevards, from the corner of the Rue Montmartre to the Rue M6nilmontant. The Rue de Vendome, where the poet resided for the last few years, issues on the Boulevard St. Martin, close to the Chateau d'Eau; the same locality where the tragical occurrences during the funeral of General Lamarque commenced. That street and the adjacent ones were so thronged that those who wvere furnished with tickets and passes found it extremely difficult to make their way to the house (No. 7) where the remains were, or to the Church of St. Elizabeth, close at hand, where the religious service was to be solemnized. At 12 o'clock precisely all the persons specially invited were assembled at the house of the poet in the Rue Vendome, and the cortfge set out soon nfterwards for the church. A magnificent hearse, adorned with branches of oak, of laurel, and crowns iof immortelles, bore the remains of the poet. The chief mourners were MM. Benjamin Antin, Perrotin (his publisher), Prospere Vernet, Professor of laiw at Toulouse-all his intimate friends of I many years; a sub-officer of the 1st Regiment of Artillery, nearly related to B6ranger, and, I believe, the only representative of his family present at the funeral ceremony; a compositor employed at the Imprimerie Imperiale of Paris, was said to be also, but more distantly, related to him. One of the Emperor's carriages and nine mourning coaches immediately followed the hearse. The Emperor's household was represented by General de Cotte, one of His Majesty's aides-de-camp; the Minister of State and of the Household by M. CGauthier, Secretary-General of the Department; the :Municipality of Paris, by M. Merruan, Secretary. General of the Pr6fecture of the Seine ; M. de Saulxum, Secretary-General of the Pr6fecture of Police, and the Mayor of the 6th arrondissoment, to which the Rue VendOme belongs. The Institute was represented by MM. Thiers, Mignet, Villemain, Cousin, de Vigny, St. Marc Girardin, and other celebrities of the literary world. Besides these, a conisiderable number of Deputies, Senators, Councillors of State, and men of letters attended the ceremony. 'The Parisian press had also its represeutatives on the occasion-M. Perron, from the .Ioniteur; M. Ren6 (Deputy), from the Constitn*iion1el and the Pays ; M. Neffzer, from the Presse; MdM. Havin and Jourdain, from the SiJcle; and the Jomnutd cles Dibats, the Patrie, the Estafette, and other journals sent their editors or managers. The mounted guards of Paris, with their colonel at their head, opened the procession, and rode on both sides of the hearse. The infantry of the same force closed it with their arms reversed, and three regiments of infantry were drawn up in line, and exteaded from the Rue Vendomelto the Church of St. Elizabeth. The crowds of people that covered the thoroughfares, that stood at the corners of the atreets, to see the procession, were immense, and as the remains of him with whose songs they were familiar from childhood, and whose strong nationahity they loved, passed along, the cries of " Vive Beranger !" or " oin7eur a Beranger I" were loud and frequent, and every head uncovered. The -windows and balconies, and in some instances the roofs of the houses, were alive with people. The hearse reached the church at a quarter-past 12. The exterior of the building was covered with ,black cloth, -which displayed shields inscribed with -the initials of the poet. The interior wore also the )ame sable hangings from the floor to the friezes. 'A border of wvhite stars ran round the nave. Shields, with the initials, and large crowns formed DEf imrortclles, were alternately placed on the dra. pery. At the extremity of the nave, close by the Idgh altar, rose a magnificent catafalque, displaying tars wrought in silver, and encircled by lamps and aighted tapers. The cure of the church, with his clergy, received the body at the entrance, and fol. loved it in procession to the catafalque in the nave. She united choirs of the Madeleine and St. Elizabeth chanted the maass for the dead and the Dies ir%e, accompanied by the organ. When the absolution ,was delivered the remains were reconducted by the xfficiating clergy to the hearse at the door; and Ithen the comieye set out for the cemetery of Pere-la. Chaise. On issuing fromthe church Itdescended the 'Rue du Temple to the Rue de Bretagne. It p,msed down this street, as also that ofithe Filles-duCalvain as far as the Boulevard, which it crossed, Pad entered the Rue M6nimontant. In all this direction the same vast crowds of people might be observed ; and the cries of IIHounur A Bgranger," were repeated during the whole passage, from the Rue St. Elizabeth to the Cemetery. I have not heard of the slightest symptom of disorder having occurred. The only moment of confusion that I could observe was when the cavalry checked the advance of the crowd as' the body issued from the Church. It lasted but a short time, and, with the exception of the streets through which the procession passed, the'circulation was free. At the entrance of the Cemetery a crowd, as great as that in the neighbourhood of the church, covered the outer boulevards, and were evidently waiting for hours before the arrival of the remains. The remains were deposited in a vault, over which a handsome monument, at the Emperor's expense, it is said, wiU be raised to the memory of Beranger. In compliance with the express wil of the poet, no discourse was pronounced over his grave. Those who formed the cortege, the multitude that witnessed or followed it, and the large body of troops that performed the double duty of maintaining tranquillity and honouring Beranger, retired in order. Two squadrons of the mounted guards of Paris patrolled up and down the Boulevards from the Porte St. Denis to the corner of the Rue Vend6me, to keep the way clear from stoppage. They were assisted by several squadrons of sergens de viule. Medals have been struck in honour of the poet, and the hawkers who sold them at a penny or twopence must have made a handsome profit, as all were eagerly bought up. The following is the placard of the Prefect of Police alluded to above:- " Fxance has just lost her national poet! The Government of the Emperor has determined that public honours shall be paid :to the memory of B6ranger. This pious homage was due to the poet *vhose songs, conseorated to the worship of the country, have aided in perpetuating in the hearts of the people the reminiscence of the Imperial glories. I learn that party men only see in this sad solemnity an occasion of renewing the disorders which at other times have signalized similar ceremonies. The Government will not allow a tumultuous manifestation to be substituted for the respectful and patriotic sorrow which ought to prevail at the funeral of B6ranger. On the other hand, the wishes of the deceased have been expressed in these touching words :-' As to my funeral, if you can avoid public noise, do so, I beg of you, my dear Perrotin. I bold in horror the tumult of a crowd, and the 6dat of speeches, at the interment of friends whom I lose; and If mine can be effected without a publio gathering, one of my wishes will be accomplished!' It has, therefore, been resolved, in accord with the testamentary executor, that the funeral procession shall be exclusively composed of official persons aud those who receivo letters of invitation. I request the papulace to conform to these arrangements. Mensuires are taken to cause the determination of the Government and the desire of the deceased to be rigorously and religionsly respected. " PETRI, Senator. "Palis, July 16, 1857." I cannotq record the death of Beranger without a passing word of admiration for his genius, andregret for his loss, which robs France of another of her few-her very few-real poets. It is true, he was but a song-writer, but into his songs his genius threw the character and feeling of a nation, and sometimes its wrongs. Essentially the poet of the people, gallant, gay, witty, satirical, and, above all French, perhaps no writer ever so completely photographed the character of his countrymen as B6ranger, or loved his country better. The deceased had nearly reached his 77th year. The following private telegraphic despatehes have been received:- "MARSEILLES, JULY 16 (ALrnms, JULY 14.) "The Governor-General has sent a despatch declaring that on the 11th, by a combined movement, the divis1ons Renault, MacMahon, Massiat, and Yusuf, occupied simultaneously the whole of tho territory Imowu by the name of Deilloul-Beni-Touraghiwitt. The troops, with admirable spirit, climbed up to retreats deemod inaccessible. The French flag floats over the highest point of the Djurdjura." " TRIESTE, JULY 16.

The Senate proceeded to-day to the consideration of the bill for a new convention between the Government and the Savoy Railway Company, including the project for tunnelling the Mont Cenis. On the discussion being decl tred opened, Senator Selopis said, that although opposed in principle to extraordinary expenditure undertaken for future years, he woluld vote in favour of the present project, because it regarded the completion of the national railways and the closer union of Piedmont and Savoy, which always shared each other's dangers, and whose sons fought side by side on the fields of Lombardy. He thought it wise, then, of Government to undertake what could not be attempted by private enterprise. Senator Mosca, after (acknowledging the political and commercial utilitv of the railway, said that no other system for passing the Alps could bIear comparison with that of tunnelling, and that he had confidence iu the engineers who proposed the new discovery to be applied for this purpose, and in the commission that had examinedjit. He should like, however, that experiments on a large scale should be made at Genoa, so as to ascertain more precisely the time and expense that might be probably calculated on. Senator Giulio said that the examining Commission had not expressed any opinion on the length of time or the expense requisite, not only on account of the novelty of the means to be employed, but also because of the nature of the ground and the length of the tunnel. This was not a case to be solved by the rule of three. He hoped, he said, because he believed-and perhaps he believed because he hoped-that theywouldencounternothing but practicable rock. Whether there might be resistance or not, an experiment at Genoa would only serve to show the celerity of the machine, and the front it would offer in battle, but it could give no idea of the strength of the enemy. An experiment at Bardonneche would be infinitely better. The diffroulties increased the further the boring went. It would be absolutely necessary to commence with ordinary means. It would requira time for making aquaducts and buildings, and crecting machinery; and, as a great number of workmen must be employed at both ends, it would not be possible to apply the new means in the first instance. Afterwards the grand experiment would be seen, and it would last, perhaps, for years, until one of those terrible diffictultieswas encountered which would cause a stop, but which will ultimately be conquered by modera art. No case has yet occurred where the energy of art and the power of genius have been obliged t) beat a retreat in face of the resistance of nature, and he thought that the pertinacious Piedmontese would not be stopped by difficulties in this case. The Minister of Finance baving replied briefly to some economical objections raised by the Senator Cotta, the question was put to the vote by ballot, when there appeared 51 votes in favour and only 5 against the BilL. Lord Lyons left Turin this morning to rejoin hit squadron at Genoa and Spezzia. His Lordship had arrived here the day before yesterday, and KinVictor Emmanuel came from the country yesterday morning expressly to receive him. Yesterdayafter noon, accordingly, Lord Lyons and several officers of his squadron were presented to HIis Majesty by Sir James Hudson, and in the evening they had the honour of dining at Court, where they met the Ministers of the King of Sardinia, the great officers of State, and Eeveral superior officers, military and naval. The squadron sails on Wednesday for Touloa and the coast of Spain. The Brunswick having sailed for the West Indies, and the Curacoa having been despatched to Tunis, the squadron, after the arrival of the Princess Royal, which is daily ex pected from the Tag-us, will consist of the Royal Albert, Princess Royal, Conqueror, and Centurion screw ships of the line, Ariel steam corvette, and Osprey and Wanderer steam gunboats. The Giornale di Roma announces that Commendatore Filippo Farina, Minister of WVar to the Pope, expired on the 9th inst. The late Mazzinian attempts naturally form the staple of all discussions on Italian politics at present; and it is really ctirious and amusing to se3 the efforts of certain Absolutist journals-German, Russian, French, and Italian-to cast the onas on the Sardinian Government, whereby they generally succeed in proving so much that they end by making themselves supremely ridiculous. According to these critics, the Sardinian Government is ill informed by its secret agents, badly served by itt police, and is itself wanting in the essential qualities of caution and prudence. If it had not been, for the warnings of the French police the train of the plot would never have .been discovered, and, even as it was, the town o Genoa was only saved from destruction by a.- cident, and not in any degree owing to the vigilance of the authorities, who were lost in a dream of fancied security. All this, they say, is the consequence of constitutional government, anI therefore, of course, they infer that constitutionalism is a perpetual source of disquietude to the neighbouring Governments, and ought forthwith to be rooted out. Admitting these assertions, then, for the sake of argunment, let us compare the conduct of the Sardinian Government with that of a genuine paternal and absolute Govermment under somewhat similar circumstances. Let us lookat Tuscany, where theGovernmentreceived the same indefinite warnings from Paris two months ago as were received here, and compare the precautionary measures taken in both cases, and the results at Leghorn and Genoa. In Tuscany we have constantly heard of the irritating interference of the police at public festivals any' time the last two months, and yet when the outbreakreally came the Government was taken by surprise, and some score of people or more losS their lives in consequence. At Genoa, on the other hand, neither public amusement nor personal liberty was in any way meddled with by th) police-in fact there was far too much laisser faire, say the advocates of despotism-yet on the nigh. appointed for insurrection both the civil and military powers were fully prepared, and only oae life was lost, and that was the consequence of neglect of special instructionsgiven for the occasion. It will strike impartial people as something excessively strange that a Government so perfectly impotent for good, as the Sardinian G3overnment is represented to be by its enemies, should have so well succeeded in crushing an insurrectionary conspiracy in a city which was known to be in a state of much discontent at some recent acts of internal legislation. Supposing the Sardinian Government to have been careless and ignorant as it is accused of being, it will naturally occur to most people to ask, what Government could have done better ? Would any other form of government have insured greater security and comfort to its own subjects and it, neighbours ? And I believe the prosecution now in progress at Genoa will satisfactorily show that the greater part of those persons who sought to create a disturbance at Genoa entered the Sardinian States with passports perfectly en -egle, from one or other of the neighbouring countries enjoying the advantages of depostic government and a political police. SPAIN. (FROMr OUR OWN CORRESPO-DENT.) MADRID, JuLY 13. The hot weather has closed the Madrid theatres, but the Cortes still sit; and lovers of burlesque and low comedy have no need to complain. In spite of the pitiless sun and elevated temperature, Her Mijesty's servants contiuue their comical capers iu the Congress. Don Ramon Narvaez is great as the pere noble, who, bewiigged and sonorous, propounds high principles of morality, legality, and conciliation. Senor Nocedal. as befits his tender years, affects more juvenile parts, and almost brings down the house as the naughty gamin de Madrid, who, while committing some diabolical piece of mischief, can hardly restrain a grinace of malicious delight. Mr. Peter Pidal is the cross-grained incle, testy and violent, whose habitual attitude is one of repose, but who occasionally bursts out wiith a vrigour and venom that have a most telling effect upon his audience. Senor Moyano is great in the part of Dousterawivel, and has lately discovered some mines of phosphate of lime, which are to pay off the whole debt of Spain, and has introdueed a law declaring them national property. The law of course passed the Cortes, but is protested against by a few individua's to whom the mines belong. As for the resi of the company, they are mere walking gentlemen, who follow their leaders and pick up crumbs. Some mention ought, however, to be made of M.Gonzalez Bravo, who, although not a regular member of the troop, has made himself very useful during the season, always ready to act as doublure, or do any sort of odd job, but who complains of having been shabbily rewarded, thinks he ought to have been taken into partnership, and does not muchlike the idea of returning to London fogs, notwithstanding the profound respect and admiration with which, a3 his friends assure us, everybody in that capital regardshim. Saturday's performance at the theatre of the Congress was particularly entertaining. The week had 1 been a busy one. Several most important bills had been hurried through the Chamber with a rapidity that proved the zeal of the Government, the unaninity of the deputies, and the desire of all parties to get the session over and escape from this scorchhvq capital. Nevertheless, the slender opposition, which Includes but Bsome three or four debaters, had made more or less fight against all these Bills. On Saturday was brought forward the Report of the Committee on the Reform of the Con, stitution-rather an important subject, it will be admitted. Expecting that it would be left till next session, the Opposition, which had already been worked off its legs in the contest against overwhelming odds, had not sufficiently studied the subject to be prepared to discuss it. IR vain did Senor Mazo denounce the impropriety of such haste; it had been announced only the day before that the debate wasforSaturday, andtheprintedreport of the committee, which, according to regulation, should be distributed at least 24 hours before the discussion on it commenced, had been but two hours in the hands of the Deputies. The President of the Chamber, obsequious, as usual, to the will of the Government, overruled all objections, and called upon Senor Borrego, whose name was down to speak against the project. Senor Borrego renounced his right of speaking. Gonzales de la Vega was next upon the list. He also declined speaking. Sanchez Silva was then called for, but answer there was none. He was too wise to be there. Dark grew the Ministerial brow with indignation at the stubbornness of an Opposition which did not seem to understand that, besides being beaten, it was expected to dance. Up rose that ready orator, Senor Gonzales Bravo, standing chairman of committees on obnoxious laws, and desired that it should be noted that he and his companions were in their place to sustain their report, and that the deputies who wished to stifle discussion were those who refused to speak. " I have a right to speak or not to speak," replied Gonzales de la Vega, "bat, besides that, I believe that never, in any Parliament, have matters of this importance been brought under discussion, announcing the debate only the day before, and distributing the report only a few moments before it commences. This is not in harmony with what the regulations lay down as the practice to be observed in such grave affairs, in order that Deputies may have the necessary time to form an opinion, and to vote with a knowledge of what they are doing." Hereupon General Narvaez got up, and, with matchless command of countenance, declared that, since the first existence of representative government in Spain, a more disagreeable spectacle had not been seen, nor one more contrary to the constitutional regimen. He asked the Opposition why it refused to oppose, and protested that, by such refusal, it was destroying the prestige of representative government. He spoke at considerable length, but the unreasonable Opposition remained obdurately silent, and an article of the bill was voted by 126 against 7. The next article was also approved without discussion. The third having been read, an amusing scene occurred. Two thorough-going adherents of Government, Senors Gomez Inguanzo and Rebaglisto, rose to protest against the improper conduct of the Opposition, and to get up a sham one. They were of opinion that the age of 30 years, fixed by the bill as a necessary qualification for occupying a seat in the Senate, was not sufficient-that men of that age were too apt to be carried away by passion, and that 40 should be the appointed limit. Senor Nocedalcombatted, with honeyedwords, thisfriendly opposition. He rose, he said, with the greatest pleasure, to answer the hon. deputy, who, of course, on his part, as he was merely making a sham fight, desired no better than that Ministerial eloquence should triumph, and 30 be proclaimed the correct figure. After this, the conversation assumed a very desultory but a not less-entertaining character. Senor Santa Cruz, the Progresista ex-Minister, who, like most of Espartero's former colleagues, is more honest than wise, suffered himself to be ensnared, by an artful insinuation that incapacity or idleness was the cause of the silence of the Opposition, into defending himself against this charge, and into a protestation that he and his few friends had done all that was humanly possible in the way of opposition. It was to be regretted, he artlessly added, that the Government had exercised so much influence in the elections, and had not allowed a few more Progresistas to obtain seats in the Chamber to assist in opposing it. This was a foolish speech. In truth, the vwisest plan the half dozen Progresista Deputies could have adopted on discovering the course the Government proposed to take, would have been to suffer every measure to be carried without saying a word against it. This would at least have shown Europe what sort of " Representative Assembly " was sitting in Macbid. Nearly the last word of Saturday's talk was for the indefatigable Bravo, whose first name is Gonzales. In England, he said (with that weight and authority which he derives from having been for two months the much-honoured Spanish Minister at the Court of St. James's), an Opposition that should behave as that in the Congress was then doing would be considered factious ! Senor Bravo has doubtless had great opportunities of observing the many striking differences that exist between the British Parliaments and Spanish Cortes. He may also have noticed, as he was in England this spring, that elections in that country are conducted on rather a different plan from that which prevails in Spain. It is possible that, when an English Government shall exist which, by the most shameless manceuvres and the grossest intimidation, shall reduce the Parliamentary Opposition to six members, it may also be deemed a grave offence on the part of these to refrain from opposing Ministerial measures. Senor Gonzales de la Vega replied to Senor Bravo, and asked if in England there was a Government that forced a Chamber to pass in 12 days a series of important measures, that could hardly be properly discussed in two or three months ? Thereupon the President called him to order, and bade him speak to the question, and then the Chamber rose, and this most disreputable exhibition ceased for the day; butnot before a Deputy put a question concerning the numerous arrests that are daily being made in Mviadrid. To which Senor Nocedal replied that the Government had already said that it postponed answering that question. It will, doutless, postpone it until the session is over. The Three per Cents. were done at 38.85; Deferred, 25.75. No operations. ELECTRIC TELEGRAPHIC DESPATCHES. (P RO3 OUn OWN CORRnsrONDi2;T.) Wind W. LIVERPOOL, SATURDAY MOURrNG.

GBEATNORTHERN RAILWAY FRAUDS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In the official report of the proceedings at the meet. ing of the Great Northern proprietors, held on the 8th inst., the chairman, in reference to our investigation of the stock registers, appears to have stated:- " Trh expense, as far as it had gone, amounted to £4700 and I b. lieve tr. Dolvitt hai not c3mplerod one quarter of the work. I am reminded that hehad investigated two stocks ontof reven, and It was notveryclear that his work would be flnisdedaernby the endof the year." Astheproprietors have been thus misinformed on the matter, we think it our duty, both to them and ourselves, to correct the misstatement, and we requeat the favour of your permission to do so through the medium of your columns. By the desire of the auditors we sent them an account Of our charges, amounting to 2,0001., to the 31st of Marchlast including cost of books, enclosed in a letter, dated April 21 from which the following is an extract:- " In answer to sour inquiy for an estimate of the time and ct in completion of our laboura in the regitration department, we beg to amre yeou that it ia most difficuit to form a oorrect notion of the time thatmayie ozcupied whicharegiates the expense; but, ater mature consideration, our opinion 4s in rogawd to time, that the preferenoe stocls may bh finished by the next meeting of the proprietors, bat that it would he unsafe to eAlculate upon the fnal completiou of tho origi I nal A and B stocks before the end of this yeer. As to cost, that the expense of completlnganireportingupon the work now In hand may ultimately amount to £5.,0, but that, with extended ofioe accommodatlon, andthe progress of tho investigation without the interruption. of any unforeeen dificulty, it maybe finslhed for considerably los than that sum, which we oonsider the mazximum." The 2,0001. expended and the 5,0001. to be expended, together 7,0001., included the whole cost of the investigation. The auditors then represented It imperative that wo ;hould complete our labours by the coming meeting, and pressed us exceedingly to do so, and accommodation beinprovided in four additional roems we were enabled to in crease our staf, 'and get the work so far under control that we told the committee-3Ir. Denison, a member of it, being present-that we were worlg with the determination to inish by the meeting in Au)ust, and hoped to do so. Up to the date of suspension-on account of this estlmate of 5,u00l.-we bad expended about 2,4001. It Is true that two stocks only were completed, but the expenditure had been upon the whole of them; 1001. more would have nnished another stock, and our experience and progress in the interim baving confirmed the accuracy of our estimate we are confident the balance (2,5001.) wouald have covered our charges for the completion of the other four. This, in round numbers, we distinctly stated in the concluding paragraph of our letter to the auditors of the 23d of May, as follows:- W We cannot refrain from expressing our regset that so large an ox penditure of the company should be rendered eompart1vely useless by the new registers o the larger stooks remailning un Ushed, epe. clally swe oonsider the further sum of £3,00D, being the balance of our ostimats of April21, would have enabled us to complete the whole work." We believe that our correspondence with the auditors, including the letters from which the foregoing extracts are taken, has been before Mr. Denison, both as chairman of the board and as a member of the committee of investigation; yet his statement is that our further charees would have amounted to threetimues 4,7001.,orl4,1001., and our total costs to four times 4,7001., or 18,8001., the fact being that 2,6001. only were required to finish, making in all 7,000l., for which sum of 7,0001. the capital of the company, exceeding8,000,0001., received during ten years, with some 50,000 transfers, would have been perfectly adjusted, exhibiting not only Redpath's frands in detail, but also the amount registered erroneously and recoverable, the calls unpaid and who owed them, the preminms received and discounts allowed on the issue of stock, the unregistered scrip held by proprietors, and the amount that properly should stand on the registers, which had not been ascertained from the commencement of the undertaing.r Ve5leave the proprietors and the pablio to judge whether the miatter was or was not fairly represented to the meeting.

CLASSICAL EDUCAT1O0N. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TI=. Sir,-One of your leading articles yesterday implies that the Society for Diffusion of Useful Knowledge disparaged classical learning and a classical education. Pernat me to assure you that the writer was mistaken in this opinion. I am tolerably conversant with the publications of the society, and intimately acquainted with the opinions of the committee by whom those publications wwere superintended. Nearly all the most active membes of the committee had been educated, many had distinguished themselves, at Oxford or Cambridge, and the contributors to all but the most popunlar of the society's works wvere generally Cambridge or Oxford men. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~o That in the society's Journal of Educat,ion the subject of clamsical education was discussed is true. But the advantage of that education was never denied, though the time occupied in attaining what little classical knowledge is in most instances brought away from school Is, in more than one article of that journal, asserted to be often misapplied. It would be satiefactory to me and to many others who took part in the labours of the society if you would insert this letter in yourjoual. The influence which the Useful Knowledge Society exercised by its publications and by its example is now matter of history. I am sure that you would not wish to write that history erroneously. -- Your faithful servant T. C. .b-ensington, July 16.

THEAl MtTBrE1IS AT UlTiArLAH.-The following is an extract from a letter, dated UmbaUah, MIay 14, written by Mr. Evans, the gentleman who, having been made the scape'oat of the practical jokers at Canterbury, has most creditabfy redeemed his position in the army, and was appointed to the 9th Lancers on the recommendation of Sir W. Williams for his good services at Erzeroum :-"Perhaps this may give you the first intelllgence of tho disturbances in this part of India, which is now in a very unsettled stite. Since Thursday, April 16, we have had incendiary fires of frequent occurrence, without being able to find out the perpetrators. On the 16th a barrack and a hospital were burnt down, and since that almost every night up to last Sunday some building has been set on fire. The bungalows, being low thatched buildings, are easily set on fire, which it is impossible to extinguish In a place so sadly supplied with water as tfiis station. 'he rnative troops for some time have been showing a discontented spirit, without breaking out Into open mutiny. There are heretwo native infantry regiments, the 5th and 60th, and one regiment of native cavalry-viz., the 4th Light, besides some Irregulars - and we have onlyono regiment oE Buropeans-viz., the 9th Royal, Lancers, and two troops of horse artillery. Last Sunday, after we had returned from church and had just finished our breakfast, at about 10 a.m,, the alarm sounded for the regiment to turn out. The men were lying in the barracks undressed, and many of them asleep, hat in an almost incredibly short time they were all on parade mounted and fuly equipped; the artillery were ready nearly as soon. When onthe parade ground we found that the 60th Native Infantry had miutinied and turned out with their arms, but we could not go down because they had their officers prisoners and threatened to shoot them if we came down; but that If we did not tbey would return quietly. If our men had had the chance to go in at them, thoy would have made short work of them, they are so enraged at haviDg bad so much nightwork lately m consequence of the fires, which are all attributed to the sepoys. They (ic., our men) only get about two nights a-week in bed. At 12 o clock, noon, we were turned out again in consequence of the 5th Native Infantry having turned out; but we were again disappointed. They appeared to think us too attentive, and returned to their barracks. For the last two nights the wives of married officers are sent down to the canteen for better security. An officer remains at the main guard all night, and an Artillery officer with the guns, which are loaded, and ammunition is served ouLt tD the men. Two patrols go out every hour, and al is *lert. Yestrday three comnpanies of the 75th (Her hI jesty's)narched in from iKussowlee. They started at noon on Tuesday.and arrivedat about 2 p.m. yesterday (Wed. nesday). The distance is 48 miles, a wonderful march under an Indian sun, when the therinoiiteter was 91 to 94 degrees in tho bade i4ez sa1 not a single straggler,''
IHMOMY-MARKBPand OITYIMTUltGENCZ. Friday ZYOnhIg. The Enolibh funds opened this morning at A recovery of three-eighths per cent. from the last official prices of yesterday, and, with the exception of a short interval, the improvement has been maintained. Consuls for money were first quoted 924 to J, and in consequence of a realization by th3 Court of Chancery they went to 92k to #. Ths Epeculators, however, did not press sales with the eagerness observable yesterday, and the marke; altogether presented a more satisfactory tone, the final transactions being at 92k to i for money, and 921 to ; for the 6th of Auigust. Among the circumstances that operated favourably were the continued influx of gold to the Bank, the unbroken splendour of the weather, the rather more confident tone of the advices from Paris, and the announocment from Lord Palmerston that the Government do not see anything in the present state of affairs to render it desiraile to call out the militia. Bank Stock left off at 214 to 215; Reduced, 91§ toI ; New Three per Cents., 91* to ; and ExchequerbilL, 4s. disconnt to par. India Stock was firmer and closed at 215 to 217. India Bonds were quoted 5as. to 10s. discount. Money in the Stock-Exchange wasmore abundant to-day than for a long time past, loans on Government Eecirities being readily obtainable at 5 per cent. In the discount-market and at the Bank, however, there was a good demand at the minimum rate of 51 per cent. In ordinary course the next telegraphic intellgence from India would not be expected before Mlonda , the 26th inst., but as every- effort wiU be made for speed it will doubtless be hoped for to-morrow week. In official quarters an impression seems to be entertained that in case of the taking of Delhi a special steamer will probably have been despatched, and therefore it is possible that further accounts may be received at any hour. It is also to be remarked that if the Governor of Maltashould adopt the same plan as on the last occasion, and transmit the advices to Cagliari, to be forwarded by the SardiDian line of telegraph, the Government may obtain them considerably in anticipation of the general public. In such case it is much to be desired that they should be made known as soon as possible in some regular and authorized manner. A strong suspicion is entertained that the main points of those last received were in the hands of apeculators for an entire day before they were properly published. It may be assumed that the heads of the Government act with discretion on such occlsions, but when striking political news has become known to any three or four persons and their immediate attendants absolute secrecy is out of the question. Moreover, in the present instance it is difficult to understand what object can be served by concealing facts which in the course of 48 hours wilU become known to all the world through other ohannels. Foreign securitieshavebeen quiet,buton thewhole prices are well maintained. Tarkish was again extensively dealt in, and at the close marked 95i, being a further reaction from their late decline. Brazilian Five per Cents. were negotiated at 101I; Peruvian Four-and-a-EHalf per Cents., 81; Russian Five per Cents., 109, 1094; ditto- Four-and-a-Half per dents., 9Q ; the Sma 97f; Spanish, 40k; ditto, for the account, 404, i; the New Deferred, for the account, 25i, 4; Turkish Six per Cents., for the accoxnt, 95, 94&, 95i, 1; ditto Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account, 102k, i; and Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., (. In the foreign exchanges the rates generally were a shade lower than last post. The corn-market was again exceedingly heavy, and sales could not be pressed except at a considerable decline. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a strong demand, with a further upward tendency at the close. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. onthe Paris Bourse this evening were 67I. C. for money, and 67f. 15c. for the'end of the month, showing another recovery of an eighth or a quarter per cent. A further sum of 48,0001. American7gold was sold to the Bank to-day. The spede by the West India mail to-day is 185,0001., of which 110,0001. is gold. The next arrival will be the Parana, about the 1st of August, which is expected to bring 400,0001. in silver from 31exico, the last letters having stated that a conducta with that amount was on its way to Fera Cruz. There was an active demand for silver to-day, and the amount already engaged to be sent by the overland mail of the 20th is 520,0001. The following letter relates to the most important question of the day-the possibility of shortening the route to India by upwards of 1,000 miles, and, at the same time, of opening up a friendly country, capable, according to universal testimony, of supplying by its productions some of the principal wants of Western Europe:- Euphrates Valley Railway Company (limited), Gresham-house, July 15, 1857. "Sir,-In requesting the insertion,at the present moment, of the accompanyiug letter, which I had recently the honour of addressing to Lord Palmerston, on the necessity of the financial support of Her Majesty's Government being extended to the Euphrates VaUey Railway, I would venture to express a hope that before this session of P*rliament is alowed to close such measures may be taken as to secure the early commencement of this great work, so essential not only to the prosperity and protection of Turkey and Persia, bat to the peaceable possession of India. " Several members of the Cabinet have assured me of their entire approval of the design to connect the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf, and their desire to see it carried out, and the bugbear of the Arabs is no longer even aBuded to. " What, then, causes the delay? I cannot believe that pecuniary support will be delayed from the mere technical difficulty that the Government in times past has not lent its credit to private enterprise, or that the fear of establishing a possibly troublesome precedent will be suffered to prevail in such a peculiar case as this. " I have before observed that the Euphrates Railway i unique, and therefore never can with any show of reason be taken as a precedent. But, admitting that it could, the departure of Government from traditional usage would demonstrate one of two things-either that it was right or wrong. If right, who would say it was wrong to follow what practice had proved to be beneficial? 3f wrong, he would be a bold aian to cite a mistake as a precedent. " The Government give subsidies, which are certain payments, to establish secondary lines of communication; can they pause about givisig an assurance of a contingent pay. ment to establish the most important line of communication in the world, and give unity, compactness, and strength to the wide-spread dominions of England? " Let it not continue to be said that 'it seems a national vice to prefer the most lavish outlay in prospect to present moderate disbursement.' Whatever tends to avert an attempt to wrest India from our hands, and bring it more immediately into conitact with the centre of our power and prevent the enormous expenditure consequent upon serious commotion in that country, is economy. "I am, Sir, your most obedient servant, ",W. P. ANDREW." "' London, June 30. "M'y Lord, -In compliance with the desire expressed by your Lordship, when the deputation waited upon yon on the 22d inst. in favour of a guaranteed rate of interest being granted by Her Majesty's tGovernment on a portion of the capital of the Euphrates Valley Railwvay Company, that the proposition should he submitted in writing, 1 have now the honour to state for your Lordship's consideration that the pecuniary support of Government is sought on the following grounds. "'2. The establishment of a railway from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf would have the effect of reducing the distance between this country and India by upwards of 1,000 miles and the time to about 14 days, or about half the period now occapied. ' ' 3. It would be the means of consolldating the power of the Sultan in his Asiatic don,inions. "' 4. By means of this railway, taken'in conjunction with the system of steam transit now being established along the valley of the Indus from Lahore to the sea at Kurrachee,* the large force stationed in the Pn jaub would be rendered of incalculable importance by steamers uniting the line of the Indus with that of the Euphnrates, 'or in that case any hostile force advancing towards the Indus would not only be met on the line of that river, but would be threatened along the seaboard of the Persian Gulf and the line of the Eunhratts in flank and rear.

THr CoG AniD SHIPBuiLDiNG TRADEs OF Tm W BA-On Thursday the usual balf-yearly returns of coals and coke shipped in the river Wear and docks at Sunderland were made up, from which It a ppears that the total number of chaldrons shipped from the 1st of January last to the 1st of July inst. was 427,808, being an increase of 59,485 chaldrons on the shipments for the corresponding six months last year. Shipbuilding, the staple trade of the Wear, does not present so favourable an aspect as the coal trade. About o00 carpenters are idle at present, but even thWs is a great iimprovement on the state of affairs two months ago, when fully 1,100 hands were discharged from the various yards along the river. The prospect of a large number of transports being taken up for India has caused a little briskness of late, and the fact of the workmen having submitted to a reduction of their wages from 6s. to 5s. per day may also have helped to thin the ranks of the unemployed. The number of vessels at present on the stocks is 71 (50 of which are sold), representing an agg e- gate tonnage of 29,810. On the 1st of July lasb year there were 98 vessels building, with an aggregate of 42,920 tons. TEa SALE OF CoRw.-A Bill to secure uniformity of measure in the sale of corn and other grain, prepared and brought in by Mr. Adderley, Mr. S. Child, and Mr. Bass, enacts that henceforth the word "bushel" in all bargain, sales, and contracts of or for corn and grain, shall be deemed and taken to mean eight gallons' impersal measure of capacity, and any person selling corn other than by the said ushel will forfeib the sum of 40s.; and all bargains made or entered into by or with any local or customa measure or weight will be null and void. Ta Avy.-The supplementary estimate of the sum required to provide for 2,000 additional seamen for service in Her Majesty's fleet, for nine calendar months, to the 31st of March, 1858, amounts to the sum of 98,3581., including 70,0821. for wages to seamen and marines, and 28,2761 for victuals forthe same.
ELECTION COMMITTEES. The General Committee of Elections yesterday nominated the following committee:- HMJNGDON (CoUvY).-Mr. Alderman Copeland, Mr. Joseph Locke, 3. EL. W. Schneider, Mr. W. Stirling; chairman, Mr. 3. IL Cobbett. MALDON. This committee reassembled at 11 o'clock yesterday. Thomas Webb, a freeman, living three or four miles from the town, statedthat he knew Riley, a miller at Woodhamwater, and that previous to the electlonRileycanvaussed him for Mr. Western, and told him that if he voted for that gentleman he should havo flour for Is. less than the customary price. He had never dealt with Riley. On the day of the election he had some beer at the Wellington. On cross-examination he said he had always been a IBlue," and that he voted for the two *'Blues." John Brlghtwell said he was not a voter, but went on the day of the election with a voter named Tnrner to the Wellington. He there Baw Mr. Western, who asked him how Turner was going to vote. Mr. Western also told him to go in and get something to drink if he was thtxsty. He accordingly went in and had some porter. Turner also had omething to drink. Neither of them paid anything Several other people were drinking, but he did not see any of them pay. On cross-examination the witness said he lived eight miles from Maldon, and seldom went into the town. He had seen Mr. Western before, but had never spoken to him. On bdng asked by Mr. lPhin to tell him which of the gentlemen present was Mr. Western the witness pointed out Mr. H. Baley, a member of the committee. On re-exwnination the witness said he was sure that the gentleman who spoke to him at the Wellington was Mr. Western, but he was not sure -whether he should now know him again. John Tarner, the voter mentioned by the last witness, sid he lived five or six miles from aldon, and on the day of he election he was taken tere in a chaise by Riley because his foot was so had that he was unable to walk. Hewent to the Wellington and had somethinig to drink. is son paid for part of what he drank, and he did not know who paid for the resif. He afterwards met Brightwell, and went wth him again to the Wellington. He saw a gentleman who was pointed out to him as Mr. Western speahing to several freemen. No one went with him to epl ovoted for Western and Peacocke. He saw severa voters among the people drnking at the Wellington Mr. Western asked him how he was and how he got the inflammation in his foot. On cross-examination he said he was too near-sighted to be able to point out Mr. Western. Brightwell was not far from being drunk at the Welington. He went up to a gentleman and asked him forsomething to drink. John Nichols said that on the day of the election he went by the direction of Riley to the Wellington and remained there eating and drnking from 11 tiff half-past 3 o'clock, when he went to the poll and plumped for Mr. Western. He paid nothing for what he ha at the Wellington, except 2d. for a pint of yporter. He saw Mr. Western talking to some one opposite the Welington between 2 and 3 on the day of the election. There might have been 20 people drinking at the Wellington. At the last five or six elections he had voted "blue." He had been canvassed by Rley, and had promised his vote to Mr. Western. He saw no one pay for what they had at the Wellington. John Prior said he had voted for Western and Moore, and had been taken to Maldon, whioh was about five miles from his residence, in iley's van. He had gone to the Welhngton and had something to eat, and as much beer as he chose to order, for which he had naid nothing. On cross-examination he said le generally voted half and half, and had done the same on this occasion. A non-voter, named Barker, gave similar evidence as to e eang and drinking going on at the Wellington on the da, of the election, James Peacocke, a voter for Western and Peacock-e, had also been taken into Maldon by Riley, and had refreshment gien to him at the Wellington. He had previousy been canvassed by Ir. Western, and said he would not votefor him HEie netver voted "yellow" before. Riley did not ask about his voe.vto. ' Some other voters who had -been provided with refreshment at the Wellngton, free of expense, having been examined, George Allen was called, and proved that he had been employed by Mr. Digby, the attorney, previous to the elec. tion, to ascertain whether there was to be any treating on the other side; that he had canvassed votes for 3Mr.Western and that he had taken some of them to the poll. He had been told by Mr. Digby that he was to be conductor of the election on the polling day. He had been paid for his services. Mr. DJigy had got him through the Insolvent Court. On cross-examination he said that Mr. Digby told him to watch the other side, bat not to give refreslunents himself. He wfas to have 7s. od. a-day. Jacob Andrews, who had been employed by Mr. Digby in the same manner as the last witness, said that he had not seen any treatingon either side, that very few people were drnkinug at the Wellington, and that he paid for what he Wiliesa Lansdel, the landlord of the King's iead at Maldont was next called. He said that he had sent in n account to hr. Digby after the election, in which Mr. Baxter's name occurred, and that MIr. Digby had requested m to soend in nother accoant, omitting or. Baxter's nhae,wichr. dd Some further evidence npon the qnestion of treating at totiesbury and other places having been given, the care in support of Mr. Peacocke's petition was cldote os *'wee committee then adjourned. The committee met again to day, air. Horsmsn in the At the commencement of the proceedings Mr. Way, the pettioner, and Mr. Tite, the sitting member, had an equal numberof votes. It was proposed to strike off one of a class of votes aDleged toFhave been improperly put upon the register by the themn barrister, although no objectlons The committee, after an hour's deliberation, decided that they would not inquire into the cases of voters whose names were upon the regIster and in whose quaoeication no change had taaen place. fr Slade, for Mr. Way, said it would be useless after tat Decion to prolong the contest. A vote was strack off by consent from or. Way's poll, and ithe committee came to upo the resolutiongtat Mdr. Tite wieasdlpry. elc ed. eswTomsNwa, oel WEYMbOUTH.I The committee proceeded yesterday to hear cvidence in support of Mr. Butt's petition. Teomas Bonella, the voter whose case owas gone into on ursday, gave in substance the same account ef the circumstances under which he bad voted as had been given by his wife andhis son-in-law. Ho hadvoted for Butt and Frestnu. Mr. H. Devenish, who had voted for Freestan and Butt, aid heo lived at Melcombe Regis, and was partner in a bewery. Heoknewmnothing of beer having been rsent to BoneDa's pablichouse on the day of the election until after it had been supplied. An order had been sent ina for the beer and ithad been suppEel upon that order. He belonged to the Iaberal7party, en e saw ThomastNewman, Bonella's sen-in-law, on the day of election he asked him how Bonela was going to vote. Newman said his father-in-law would vote for nr. Bnatt, and not for COlOnel Freestun, unless his emand on account of the last election was paid. At a subsequent interview ndsman showed him five or be apuer. which he said Simmons had given hign, adding that hi father sheald vote for Batt and wFreestou. oftewmau's mother spoke of the landlord having threatened to seize the goods for rent, and he advised Newman to go and pay his rent, whereuponNewmanwent out. His partner, he said, seconded Mr. Butt at the nomination. A witness was then caled who proved that a guarantse nwas ven by Dennis for the beer sent into Bonella on the day of the election. r1ae completed tho evidence with regard to Bonella, and the next case taken was that of Samuel Edinands. MrsumBonelld was recalled, and stated that on the day of he elechon Edmands and Simmons were in her house, and sho heard Edmumds say that for IOt. he would be a plumper. Se then saw Simmons take some gold out of his pocket tand give it to Edmunds, and they went out of the house On cross-examination she said that she had been saummoned several times since she had begdin to keep a publichouse, and had frequently been fined for keeping the house open on Sunday mornings. She had also been summonedfor having in her possesslon clothes said to belong to a person named Collier. When she first took her house youn 'women vTed sometimes to come to it. On re-examination she stated that she had frequently ben summoned for non-payment of peer-rates, and that her husband had been summoned and &ied in consequence of having lent a suit of clothes belonging to another Jobn Cole, a porter, employed On the Quay at Weymouth, stated that on the morning of the election ho was at th Freemasons' Arm, here he sawr lidinnds and Sim mons. He had some beer with Simmons. HIe saw Simmons call Edmunds out of the house, and soon afterwards he also went out and saw them go into a shop. He afterwards saw them go towards tho polling-booth. Later in the day he saw Summons, and remarked " That he had bought his man." Simmons laughed, but mado no reply. Cross-examined.-Edmunds was in Mr. Dovenlsh's employment. He spoke in a joklng manner to Simmons. Re-examined.-Edmunds had told him in the morning that he should vote for whichever candidate Mr. Devenish pleased. In the afternoon he said to Edmunds, "Why, you have gone agaist us altogether." Edmunds sid Mr. Devenish had told him that he might do himself any ood that he could, and as he was a peer man and want a loaf of bread he had gone and done it. Witness said to him he supposed he had got 10 or a dozen pounds. John Tompkin said he had carried the beer from Mr. Devenifh's brewery to the Freemasons' Arms on the day of election, and corroborated the last witness's account of his conversationi with Edmunds. On cross-examination he said he took the beer at 11 o'clock and remained till 4 or 5 o'clock, not in order to see that Bonella voted, but because it was a holyday, and he raetsa mate with whom he had a pipe. MIr. H. Devenish was recalled and examined with regard to his conversation with Edmunds. He said that Edmunds had said to him that he would not vote for Campbell unless he was paid for it, and asked him whether he would be offended if he (Edmunds) did vote for Campbel. His answer was, " If you are paid for it you may do as you like."; Since the election he had asked Edmunds whether he had been paid 101. or 121. for his vote, but Edmtnds had refused to gi ve hima an answer.

The committee apointed to try the merits of the petition against the return o Mr. Merry for the Faflrk dinglct of burgah met for the firt time yesternia. The mnembers are Sir T. Pakiagton (chairmn) M1r. :Blakemore, AD. Kershaw', Mlr. Hfolford, and 3Mr. F. W. Russell. Counsel for the petitioners, Mr. EdwinTJames, H. Power,' and Mr. Bourke; for the sitting memaber, Mxr. Phmun, Mix' Roawell, and Mrs. Hthale. The netitioners are 3r. Forbes, of Callander and Mr ' Russell; banker, Falkik. They charge Mr. Mierry with havmnf procured his return by bribery, treating, f tosther Mr. J5 zn called the attention of the committee to tha fact that the original copy of the petition was ful of intr. lineationx and eramnes, and stio tted that his leane friends on the other adeo should not be alowed to proceedi tuntil they gave a satisfactory explanation of those alteraP tions. Mlr. JaS mainedtained that the interlineations bae erasures were not of material importance, aLnd did not affect the -validity of the petition. The Coms srrz after consideration, overruled the ohb. jection of Mfr. P'hinn, and Mr. JAmmx opened the case for the petitioners, Tbea numbers polled at the last election for the Falkirk burgbs were-for Mr. Merry, 769; for Mlr. Baird, 490; majority for the former, 279. Bribery was practised by the succesful candidate and his agents to an enormous extent, and a large sum of money was expended in treating. In all the barghs comprised within the Falkirk district-lnark, Fallrk,Airdrie, Hamilton, and Linlitbgow-the provisions of the Act for the Pzevention of Corruption were violated in the most unblushing manner. One mnan received lot, for his Tote; another was offered 201., but re' fused it; attempts were made to corrupt portions of the Edinburgh press; and he believed it was a fact that two men died in Hamilton from excessive drinking during the election. Publichouses and whiskystores were opened in each of the burghs under the name of cornmittee-rooms, for the purpose of debauching the electors, and unhappily the device succeeded. A more flagitiou.s case, in truth, was never submitted to an election commit. tee, and he could not allow himself to entertain the shadow of a doubt as to the result. To give the comimittee some idea of the extent towhich the treating was carried, he stated that the following publicans' bills were said by Mr. Merry in Hnmilton alone:-Pillan, 701.; John Hiamil. ton, l1. - Alexander Gray, 11l.; George Hamilton, Sol. 2s. 6id; Robert CunZngham, 401.; John Millar, 141.; Robert Cooper, 801.; Robert Lightbody, 204; Wil. H1am Park, 401. The published expenwes of the sittin member amounted to about 2,6001., but the actual cost far exceeded that sum. Mr. Murdoeb, the election auditor, stated that Mr. Merry raid through him something hke 1,600t. Since the expiration of his powers under the Act ho bad received from the agent of M1r. Merry receipted accounts to the amount of 7004 Hle did not even yet know what the election exyenses really were. Patrick Quigley, a travelling dealer in cloth and other goods, said he was a voter in Lanark, but resided in Edinburgh. day or two before the last election he received a letter from a grocer in LAnark, named Brown, requesting him to come toLanark and vote for Mr. Merry, and pro. r ising to pay all his expenses. Brown was an agent of lr. erry. itness went to Lanark, saw Brown, and asked 101. ior his vote. Brown coneented; the money was lodged in the hands of 3r. Wood, a stationer. Witness voted for Mr. Merry, and immediately thereafter received the 101. from hfr. Wood. It was in the shape of a bank-note, which was changed for hitm by Brown himself. Witness was also treated at[ the Commercial Inn by the friends of Mr. Merry In cross-examination, Quigley admitted having stated to Mr. Brown that 101. would not cover his expenses, as he haX been obliged to travel all, the way from iunfermline, but denied having added that he hadhad to employ a man anda boy to look after his business during his absence. A broker named Keane informed the committee that he was employed by Brown to carry the letter addressed to Wgley to Edinburgb, and that he received 1U. lOs. for his trouble. Thomzs Hilihouse, a person connected in business with Quigley, stated that theletter from Lfcmark arrived in Edinburgh when Quigley was absent in the country, and was d e; ivered to Mrs. Quigley. She showed it to witness; who,' seeing its importance, made out a copy and sent it to Quig. ley, retainig the original inhis own pOEsession. After the election he entered into communication with Mr. Baird's committee, and the result was that he gave them the letter for IL .0ls. The witness declared, in cross-examination, that his rin cipal object in bringing the letter to the knowledge ofrAlr Baird's committee was to expose the present system o? voting, as he is an advocate for the ballot-a statement which created considerable merriment. Re admitted, how.. ever, having asked 21. for the letter in the frst instance. carter named Lyon residing in Lanark, spoke to having been offered 20t. by Mr. Brown for his vote. ' e refused it. Mr. Whiteford, a farmer in the neighbourhood of Lanark, said that at the time of the election he owed 31.10W- to Mr. Brownforgoods received. Mr. Brown sent for him, and asked him to vote for Mr. Mierry. IHe refased, votes} for Mr. Bair andd shortlIy after was proceeded against by At this stage the committee adjourned.

LA1IW REPORT. COURT OF CHACA1NY, LnNcoI Ium,JYVL 17. IN BANKRUPTCY.-EX PAI'.TE 1YDEP. IN RV. RfVflL iWYe ut "LORDS JUSTICES of APPVAL). This was an appeal from a decision of Mr. Commissioner Eilroyd, which was reported at enormous length' in the colemns of She Times'of the 3d of Jane last, iDj which his HIonour refused the bankrupt, Mr. Thomas Ryder, an East. Inia merchant, late'of Old Broad-streot, any certificate, and gave him only such protetion I as would enable him to appeal to thisCourt. Tho case has been twice before mentioned to the Lords Justices, and was oD the 3d of Jultdinstant ordered to stand bver for the exanination of the bankrupt and of Mr. Warner, I the trade assignee, and the only opposing creditor: Mr. Selwyn vad adr. liimilton Iumphreys were counsel for theappeal; Mr. Swanston and Mr. E. D, lIHlroyd supported the Commiseionen' j'dgwent., Thegroundsof the Commissioner's judgment, were that the bankrupt had had time bargains in stockaud in foreign scrip, and. hLd'thusibrought i44nself within thd penalty of the 201st section of tho Bankrupt Law Consolidation Act, and was not entitled to 4is zertificate; and sewonfly, that he W.dobtainedgoodafroutheop posingcreditor by falseand raudulent repre§entations of ilvency, and therefore by the same statute was not entitled to aun certificate whatmver. The bankrupt, examnined 'by lIS. 8aL'Y, swvore in effe.t as follo*s, for as, although the examination was svtv&voes, it wes conlducted, so far as Mr. yder wa&s concerned, 5020 soce; the exact words cannot be'given :-" I had a conver. satmnOf with Mr. WVarneron the 7th of Deceumber, or between that day and the 12th. Be nevcr asked me whether Iwa3 a solvent man. I never told himl was notonly a:solventlut a prosperous man." Inanswer toquestlons from the Bench:- "l adhere to that staterment,lhave swore that innmy affidavitI and there Is nothing in that affidavit which, upon reflection, I would wish to correct or alter." In cross-examinatiop by Mr. SWANSTON, the bankxupt, sad, "I admhit ]~Was not solven3t at that timie, but I fully believed myself to be then tolvent. I never was asked the question. If I had been asked such a question I' should have answered that it would depend npon the outcoming or result of my shipments. I admit I told Mr. Warner that I would not trade under false colours, and I explait that I meant to refer to the observation he had previously made, that I must be either a very clever man or a man of large capital, for I then said 'I mUbt be clever and a man of business,for I certainly am not th6 latter.' 'Ar. Swanston tben proceeded with the exaniinatior as to tho stock jobbing charge, at the end of which Lomrl Justice Knigbt Brmce remarked that, though proved they were outside the time spoken of in the Act of Parlia- Ilel-examined bv Mr. SELwvv.-He swore that his books were kept as usual and with no view to mislead or deceive. Joseph Charles Clark-e swore that he kept the books of the bankrupt for three or four years; ho made up the ao. counts monthly; they were mnade up in the usual manner, in tbe regular course of mercantile business, and not in any wav with any view to concealment or deception. Mr. Warner, examined by Mr. SNYA1STON, said he had an interview with the banlrupt on the 7th of December 18n'5. " After I had made the remark before spoken of i sai(l. 'Tbomas Ryder are you solvent?' B;P rSid, I Not *nly solvent but a prosperous man.' I would not have trstedhimn "utfdrthltrepresentation," Incress-examination he-~wore, "I adnit'I tried toget some security for what he owed me, as I consider was natural when I fond I was likely to lose my money ;" amd, in answer to qnestions from the Cousr, " I swear that the bankrupt told ire distinctly in answer to a question I asked him, ' I am a isoIvent and a prosperous man.," Wr. SELWN then addressed the Court in sukport of the appeal, and was followed, very briefily, by Mr.. UZafrLnroN Mr. s'tp,2;sTOi and Mr. E. D. HIor,noy argied that the Commissioner's iudgment was correct; the la4tei learned gentleman rerding the following passage froql the CoimissioUer's iudgment, relating to the offenechof gaminF. Afterreferrmng to the 201st section the judgment pro. ceeded:-"-" lowo with. referencetto-the .cbnstri,ction to be pnu-uponr that section, Lord Justice ICnig t' Bruce (in *Ex parte Matheson,' 1I De Gex, M. and (l. 4.50, and 1 Bankruptoy Appeals, .1) says, ahat vhether .thb 201st section be a penal seetionuor not t,b wards mu st be interpreted according to the rule appl2icible to the Oonstruction of all statutes from the earliest time-that is, I to suppress 'the mschief and advanCe the remedy. It ap)pears to me that according to the fair SnO obvious meaning of the words employed to express the intention, of the Legislature the words ' gining or wigering,' in the *first branch of the 201st sect,ion, mst apply to all gaming or wagering, and whether it lawful or unlajvful games. Tbe Act contains no expression to confina, the terms ' gaming or wagering' to gaming or w ageog :in ay particular kind of games like the older Act in which the different (descriptions of gaming r piid h Legislature bas adopted 'the* same or t first branch of the 202st section of the Bankrupt LanrCorsoUdation Act, 1849, as Are used in the an of Victoria. I think the intention of the! Legislate 'by the words in the second brnho h 0st vection was to include dealings which might not niouint to 'gatiiug or wagering,' and not to exclude .from the first branch of that section deilungs which come within the fair And obvious meaningmof tbo.teru 'gaming or wagering,' the effect of which- would be to give a different meanitg to the term ' gamiDg or vgering,' as *m;ed in the Bankrupt Law Consolidation Act, from what the same words bear as used in the 8th and 9th of Victoria, cap. 109. : I think there is nothiig in thei20st Section from which it can be collected thatzte intention of the Legislature was that the particulatr words in the scond branch of the section should control the general words in the first branch, and it has been held that if in the same Act of Parhament there be one clause which applies to a particular case, and another which is conceived in general terms, the former shall not restrain the signification of the latter, at least where the intention of the Legislature is not apparent to that purpose. Now, here it appears to me that 'the intention of thb Legislature was the other way. The second branch of the 201st section was nece3sary for the purpose of taking in losses on cohtracts which the Legislature thought fit to nprohibitn,though -hot amounting to gaming or wagering,-or losses on other contracts whiob, though amounting to gaming or wagering, did not involve a loss of 201. in one day. A bond l fide contract for the purchase or sale of stock, where not to be performed within ene week after the contract, would not psmr se be gaming or wagering even, if theoparty had pot the Stockast the time. But such a contract would come within the second branch of the 201st seetion: Again, a bond fide con. tract for the purchase or sale of stock might terminate In the stock not boing actually transferred or delivered.- This, -under the second branch of the 201st section (a loss having been thereby incurred in manner therein mentioned) would dlisentitle the trader to his certificate -,'but stillthis would mot Do gaming or wagering unless at the time of the contract there was no intention on either side that stock should be delivered, and unless the intention was that the contract wasto e sttld y te pymet f dffeencs.Again, a wessto by stimed baran thin PthefunDd, idf not to -the extent of 201. in one day, though to more than the amount of 2001.

The arguments in this casewvere resum'ueda ` By indenture dated the Ist of Fbebuary, 180G, t& Eastern Counties allway Company granted to the plaintiff, for the perliod of-10 years, the sele and exclusive right of posting and exhibiting advertisements in the comprmy's second and third-class carriages, and in the stations upon he several lines and branches of the Eastern Counties Dailw y, and also the gole and exclusive privilege of selling,bools, pampblets, newspapers, and pther publications at such of tho said several stations of the said company as the plairitiff should think fit for that purpose, and of using ttha bookstalls thereat respectively, excwpt the sale by the zomp~ny of titme tables and train bills. The deed also contAingd il covenant on the part of the company that all books, &c., advertisements and placards sent by the leasseeasto he sold, posted, sffixed, or exhibited, or published, pursuant toD the ricensi a or privileges therehy granted, should be conveyed over all or any portion of thc lies of railway and branches specified in the schedule to any such stitioni of. thq company without auy charge whatsoever. The plaintiffs, the lessees under this agreement, alleged in their bill sevetal specific grounds of complaint against the company aslto the periormance by them of the agreement,-frst, as t the pro. posed removal of the bookstall at Bishopsgatestreet terminuas to a far less suitable position upon the platfbrni, which would have the effect of depriving the plaintiffs ' of a very large amount of busines ; secondly, the rerpovil at certain stations of the advertisements and placards affixed by the plaintiffs; thirdly, the refusal of the company to convey certain parcels free of charge upon the line, on 'the ground that the plaintiffs were not entitled to sell books,' &c., to any persons except travellets on the railway*; fourthly, that the company bad refused to allowv the plaintiff, to erect bookatels,at stitions where t4uere were onen already in existence, The bill prayed specific sperfornuanc of the agreecomplaine,d of. Mr. CAIRN5, Mr. HETUERINGTON, and Mr. CAPEJJ CURE, for the plaintiffs, contended that they were entitled to the undisturbed enjoyment of tbe bookstalls in the position in which they stood at the time of entering into the contract; and that the proposed remioval of the Bishopagate btation boolrstall - would prove inost midchievous, and deprive them of a large proportion of their customers. The grant of the exclusive right of selling books, &c., at stations would carry with it whatever wag necessary for the reasonable exercise of that privilege. It was inpossible to confine the sale to b1ond fde travellers. Any one coming to the station,; and, allowed upon the platforn, Would have an equal right to purchase at the bookstalls ;. and it was well known that persons in- tbe neighbouring tdwns were in the habit o: resorhingbo the bookstall at the station as the best' plac forsnppyin~themelve wit th- cheap literature of theldaya Th s plalngti.ffswelre -therehfore entitled to the free carrige of all parce,ls forwarded along the line of books, &c.,. to be soldl by them at the stations vwithout refexence to the, p,urchasers.- TheVic'-CirNcnLLou was of opinion, upon this part of tho case, that the plaintiffs asserted too latgo a right. The agreement contemplated tbe sale to persoqs being bond, fide at the atatioss for the purpose of either travelling them.e selves or meeting, &c., their friend& who were travelling. It could nothld su'Pposed to inclade the inhabitants of the towns coming up to the station to make a good bargain for books and papers, nor 'wais it intended that the plaintifs should establish ain agency for the neighbourhood. Mr. ROLr, Mr. GOLDSnnInD, and Mr. KNox WraOlAim, for the company, coitended that they were entitled to place the bookstalls at the Blishopszgate or other stations in such a position as to bh most suitable to the irafflic arrangements' prosidedit was done bond filde, and wlthoub frand upon the lessees, iTo retain, the stall in its Plsent'position for all time might-work the greatest injuty.to the 'plaintiffs them:' selves if the company found it necessaryl to make any change in the entrance or the position of the platform-by nob i'eats an improbable contingency. With respect to the advertisements some of the stationmastersvap$eAred to have exceeded their -instractions and this 'as not;any offilcient ground for applying to this Court for -relief. There was nothing in the contract-to entitle the plaintiffs to erect fresh bookstalls. --4 l Qr, CArs replied. The VIcE-CHANCELLoR said that, although the bll prayed specifio performance of the agreement between the plaintiffs and the company, certain declarations of right as to specific portions of the deed and the construction upon ceitain points were asked also, which it was not in the habit of the Court to grant, except so far as it could provide that the particular agreement should not be brolken.- The plaintiffs were legitimately entitled to relief as to the pulling down the placards and advertisements,-: and as to the rebrioval of the bookstall 'at the Bbihopggate'atre6t Station. At' this station what.might be termed mettropolittan bookstall, was i existence at the time of the contract being madenot a merely movable stall, bnt an actual room or shop, ap' propriated and fitted up for Tending books and publications and, no doubt, thisawas a leading feature in-the contemplation of the plaintiffs when they entered into their contract with the company. Upon the strict bonstrtction df . the dleed he wasofopnion thMt'*herever A particular Shop or dstelhwas in existence at the date of the- contrabt, 'of which plaintifff were to have the use; 'they eould not be dispossessed of it. It was said upon the other sids that unless the plaintiffs conld' compel the company to alhere to the existing arrangements as to passenger -trafflc, the positlon of the down-platformns &c., the -plaintiffm might themselves be deprived of all the benefits therefrora by now inssting that the bookstall should remain in its existing position. The contingericy, 'however, of any such change was but very remote, and both parties inight fairly rely upon the present arrangements 'reminihg. Ab the samo tune it was a question as to hov far the Court would be disposed to give relief to the plaintiffs-with jegardto that bookstall, unless an yserious inconvenience cohld be hown to arise to them from the change of position. Though nob inclined to stretch the point in favour of the plaintiffs, the case made by them in this respect was by no means friv lous, as there would be a very.seriousdonrecjation to the piaintiffs of their property by the proposta transfer, The presontposition of the stll, in reference to the rsilinv or g the passengers by the first train from ose by the train immediately succeeding, was such that the passengers waitingfor the second train, in a Wempsratively idle state, and at that very'time when thayrwere most inclined to becoineprchasers, were brought inimmediat4contact with the stall. Bytheehange.proposed Only those peiaons who were i the fiuryofdepartingbytheirst train wouldbenear the hookstaL. Looking t the very high rent of 1, 500. a- year for thefirsfive and 2,0001. a-year for the last five years of the term paid by the plaintiffs for this privilege, which would boyery seriously endangered by the proposed change, hemuthl that 'te were entitlecl to restrain ethe removal of the Bishopsgatestreet bookstall, and also of the advertisements, &c., from the walls of the various stations. 'WIth respect to the deelaration sought by the plaintiffs that theyiwere entitled to place bookstalls, in. any staton where they did not now exist, there was nothi-- i- the contract to enable the Court to inake suoh a declarathon, or to frame any order in that respect to which effect could he given. Many difficulties would arise upon the matter. It was a contract 'which the Courttcould not deal with, and being of opinion that the plaintiffs could not insist upon it, .thematter must be left to the good faith of the paTties. With respect to the sale at the stations, upon 'which a very serious question had been raised by the plaintifib, he had 'already held that they hadtotaly falled. The clauie plainly referred to a sale at the stations topersonsthero bomdfde for thepurpose of travelling, and ndt to a general agency, so as to enable partieslivingat towns iximiles off, yerhaps to come and smake advantageous bargains for obtaining Books for the. supply of their customers Without the edpense of car- inage from London. Upon the other parts of the case the conductof the plainti¢fi bad been such as to make him hesitate whether he should give thent any relief in the' suit./ He wasbyno-ineans satisfied as to the.bonm Sides of their conduct with respect to the transiisslon hud direction of parcels, containing books and papers for bther-persons thantheagents atthebookstalls. Astothis part; hoiever,the defendauats' wete entitled, if not to open the parcels, to stand by and seo them opened, and that they did hot con. tain anything but what -the plaintiffs were entitled to have transmitted without charge; and so far the remedy was ibt their own hands, With respect to the iniportant right, ou the other. hand, claimed by the plaintiffs, of retWining the bookstalls unaltered, if relief were. refosed intlthis ceubt they would have no adequate remedy by' damnages;gor in any other way. Though greatly dissatisfied with the conduct of the plaintiffs, he would not say that they had thereby forfeited their right to relief upon this point, and an injunction would bo granted, restraining the defendants from evicting the plaintiffs from the.bookatall at the Biofhopsgate-station, or any other bookstaU existing at any of the stations on the company's railway. land comprised inthe pontnoat ,j The defenldants would alss be restrained roXiSem obO.dveunens, lacads,&c.Therest
TO THE LPDITOR OP THE TIMES. Sir,-In the report of my speech on Mr. Roebuck's motion which appeared in The T'imes of this date I am niae to state that, on the occasion of excbanging the ratifications of the treaty of 1814 'writh Plersia, Sir Harford Zones the British Plenipoteitiary, "punched the Shabhs hedaantthe wail."1 It was the representative of the Shah who was maltreated. Such an insult to his own person would have probably been rtgarded as a casus bcUi by the Shah, though he Ieems to have cared very little what happened to his Prime Minister.

This morning, in the absence of the Mayor (Ur. F. Shand), the Deputy Mayor, Mr. J. H. Turner, accompanied by Mr. Charles Turner, Chairman of the Dock Committee, Mr. Alderman Bold, and Mr. Frank Heywood, proceaed on board the Hortense, where they were received by the French Conabl and Introduced tobis Imperial Highness, who asked many questions respecting the commerce of the port, and appeared to be much interested bythe forest of tal masts in tho long line of docks that for six miles fringe the east sido of the Iersey. The Princeafterwards proceeded on boa*d the United States' steam-frigate Niagara, where he wag received bj CaptairnHudson. He was shown over the vessel, with the noble proportions and eapacity of which he +amed highly delighted- and his attention was also directed to the proeess of coiing the great Atlantic submarine telegraph cable on board. Captain Hudson explaiued the proFerties of the cable and its irode of manufacture, ana presonted his Highness with apiece of it, and with a cbart showing the p]acewliereit is to bhlaiddown. ThePrince, whbrepeatedly expressed the plcasure he had derived from this interesting isit, stayed on board about an hour and a-hali. On taling bis departure the lards were manned n%nd three hearty cheerswere given by the Americakn crew. His Imperial aighness landed at the stage, and was driven to the Townball, and thence to Aintree, with the intention of witnessing the sports at the Liverpool races. He retufned in abogt a couple of hours, and proceeded to St. Georke's-halln and thence to the rivet,'takiag boat for the Hotense. ThIs evening the Deputy Mayor and Mx.

Being totally unconnected with the company, and yet having had occasion for some years to 'be frequently travelling-in their steamers* it it easy to see that they are faithfully and honestly servedby their servants, afloat and ashore -in the West Indies. The tact, talent, and-energy. of their- agent at St. Thomas's, Mr. Cameroi, ate well knton. To fulfithe contract risk of lifeis iunieeded. The Di-ectora are just andlhon6urable men, evincing liberality to the public, and I preiume they appreciate service3 rendered, If so, they need' not be told that articles signed in England and aIed by death abroad; - hough apparently* can' celled on earth, may' 'still be registered above.. Doubtless rhey simply require to know the actual stat- of affairs to -xTeuder 'ju- tice, if nly to 'those that live; thP ' Wax ae - hushed, but a voice froni'the 'est Lidaes, coming from among' them, though weak, may^-a an appeal loud enough, if heard through the organ which, unader Providence, stayed the pestilence in the Crimea. Turning to the same source may again stop much misery abroad, and thus give 'a check at home to the scenes of distress publicly taking place every fortnight at Southampton Docks on the arrival there of a NVest India packet. I am, Sir, yours. &c,. :A WEST ZDiA TRIVELTY TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In requesting a few lines in your columns on a subject of considerabie sanitary importance, I only do what many others of my feUow-passengers have the wish to do, who indignantly feel the great risk they have been eYposed to from what I am about to relate. The yellow fever has unfortunately broken out this year with unusual mailignity at the Island of St. Thomas, at the present moment every ship of the Royal Ifail Stean Company in the West Indies beiig more or lessinfectedbyit. It broke out in the Orinoco afew&dys afterher arrival at that island, and during the two weelrk she remained tbere eight of her men died. On her sailing on the 1xt of this month there. were nearly 40 cases under treatment on board, of whom 18 or 19 have died on the passge home. Now, what we complain of is the agents of the comnany allo*ing the Orinoco to proceed to sea with so much disease on board of her. Through the mercy of Phovidence none of the 169 passengers were attacked by it; but no thanks to the company. We had eood weather and a smooth sea. Had it been otherwise, wLat the r'sult might have been it is frightful to contemplate. It will perhaps be said that the landing of so many sick men and the difficaLlty of r4placing I them by others was impracticable; but not so; the comn I pany had one of their ships lying under repais at the mouth of St. Thomas's Haabour, where the sick might have been sent, and from which fresh men might have been draughted to carry the Orinoto home. Although no deaths took lace among the passenger', the di4comfort to which many o them on board were stbjected waS painfulto witness. To avoldhearingtheagonizinggroans of thle sick, separated only by a thin ca-vass sercen, many of them had tosleep on deck nearly ill the passage home, and those, less alarmed than others, who remained in their cabins could not sleep at night for the moaning& of the dying. It is not for me to suggest a remedy. I can sbato, however, that the belief in the West Indies is that the fever is generated at the company's coal wharf, constructed'of old rotten hulks ina pent-up corner of a veryhot harbour; and, as the town of St. Thomas's isfree from the disease, there is probably truth in the surmise. At all events, prompt measures should be taken at once,, either by the company or the Government, to endeavour to step suceh a great sacrifice of human life. I am. Sir. vour. kn__ A PASSER 1iRV Fi'i! nirTnorl Un Board the Oriioco, July 15.
