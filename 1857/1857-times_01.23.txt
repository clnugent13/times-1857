Money-Market and City Intelligence.
MONEY-MAMT e .Td CITINT.ELLIGBNOB.
Thuxsday Evening.
The English funds have been very steady to-day at a fractional advance oIa the prices of last evening. Couisols for money ranged between 93- and 931, the final quotation being 9ga to D. For the 5th of February the only price was 93W. The public continue to make investments on a moderate scale, and, although there was no expectation that the Bank would this week resort to any new restrictions, the possibility of some change had been so far entertained as to cau_e the market to become rather stronger whien the question was set at rest by the brea!-ing up of the Coart. Bank Stock left off at 216 to 217k; Reduced, 94 to i; New Three per Cents., 9l to ~; India Stock, 219 to 221; Exchequer-bonds, 98~ to 99k; and India-bonds and Exchequer-bills, 2a. discount to 2s. premium.
The rate for money in the Stock Exchange to-day on Government securities was about 5} per cent. At the Bank of Engh1nd and in the discount market there is a steady demand, without actual pressure.
Foreign seeurities were firmer in the earlier hours of business, but the highest quotations were not in all cases supported. Turkish Six per Cents. for money were negotiated at 94k, and for the account at 95L, i, and 95; the Eoour per Cents. Guaranteed were dealt in at 10S2. The other business comprised-Brazilian Five per Cents., 102 and l01o; NeW Gransada, 214F; Guatemala, 5S ; Mlexican, 216, t, and 2; Portugruese Three per Cents., 44; Russian Four-and-a-fhalf per Cents., 96i and 96; the Small, 97; Spanish' New Deferred, 23k; Spanish Certificates, 56 ; and Venezuela, for account, 36..
The telegraphic quotations of the French Three per Cent.s from the Paris Bourse this evening were 6Sf. 5c. for money, and G6f. 9Sc. for the end of the month. These ligures seem to be erroneous, and probably the prices for money and account have been reversed. The closing quotations yestercday were 67f. 70c. for money, and 67f. 95c. for the account.
A further sum of about 25,0001. in gold was taken from the Bank to-day for transmission to the continent.
The arrivals of silk from China during, the past week have been 14,694 bales, amosnting to an aggregate value of about 1,500,0001. The country, therefore, is to that estent richer, but the degree in which the effect will be immediately manifested must depend upon the proportion that may be purchased of us at once for foreign markets. If the Lyons' houses prove large buyers the French exchange will be influenced, and the operations of the Bank of France to obtain gold from this side will be proportionably obstrueted; but for the moment the home demand seems sufficiently active to prevent any rapid exportation. In that case our
manufacturers will ultimately be prepared to ship,. increased quantities to the various markets of the world in the costly form of finished goods, but the returns in the shape of specie or produce will he less speedy. While these arrivals, however, add to our available wealth, it must be borne in mind that by placing the various China houses in London in funds they may lead to an increase in the shipments of silver to that country, either in payment of balances or for the pourpose of obtaining fresh consionnients.
With the viewv of putting a stop to the ruinous litigation, both in Chancery and Bankruptcy, which is now eating away the assets of the Royal British Bank, and also to the stay of executions against the individual shareholders, for the most part at the instance of persons who have bought up debts at a low price, some of the principal shareholders are exerting themselves to collect a fund to settle with the creditors, and terminate proceecdings which the judges have truly described as a disgrace to the adminrtratiou of the law. It is urged that it will be the duty and policy of all who are under liability as past or present shareholders to come for-ward and aid the moveement without an lioun s delay; and meanwhile it must be for the interest of the creditors to show forbearance. Mlany shareholders have been obliged to leave the country to avoid the vexatious proceedings of some disreputable practitioners; and an instance is mentioned in which 14 writs of execution were issued against as many shareholders for one debt, the costs amounting to nearly four times the sum due. Should this state of affairs continue it is feared that others wil follow the example of withdrawing, whereas, if reasonable time be afforded, the absentees, it is believed, will, either by themselves or their friends. readily endeavour to further an arrangement.
At a special general meeting of the Imperial Brazilian Mining Association held to-day the report of the committee of shareholders, recommending a dissolution, was unanimously agreed to. The property possessed by the company is stated to extend over 30 square miles, and includes mineral and agricultural estates, with plant, &c. In the course of the proceedings the reqaisite number of shareholders were chosen to co-operate with the directors in taking the preliminary measures for the legal winding-up of the association. It was stated, in answer to a question that the last call will be enforced, the money being necessary to provide for current expenditure. Subjoined is the report of the committee -
The committee, having fully considered the condition and prospects of the association, have to report as followsviz., the loss for the 1S months ending the 30th of June, 1856, amount to the sum of 10,097l., a geat ortion of which has been expended in driving the Joinville's adit, for the purpose of explorint for Daval's shoot. The adit has now reached the spot where the shoot should be; and there bein no indications of its presence, and nothing to recommend a farther search, the committee urgently advise the dissolution of the company in the best andspeediest manner possible."
The following letter relates to the observations made the day before yesterday in the Court of Exchequer regarding the case of " Kingsford v. Merry" :
"' Sir,-With reference to the statements of the Lord Chief Bsron and Mr. Baron Martin, reported in your papr of yesterday, on the subject of the manner in which this case was stated to the Court of :Error, we have the pernnis. sion of all the three learned counsel for the defendant, by whom, along with those of the plaintffs, it was most anxiously prepared and carefuly settled, to state, that that case fully and correctly sets forth the whole of the facts proved at the trial, and fully and clearly raises all points relied on by the derendant. We have further to state that the judgment of the Court of Exchequer detaied the facts on which It proceeded, and that that judgnt, embodying those facts, was fully before the Court of Eor when its decision ws given." "We are, Sir, your obedient servants,

"LIFE IN MANCHESTER."-On Tuesday evening
"Lrsn zr M NCfEsM R.".On Tuesday evening Canon Stowell delivered a lecture bearing tho above title, before a very large audience, in the Free Trade Hall, Manchester. The lecturer said that it was his intention to sketch the general and prominent characteristic features of "Manchester hife," not in tho lower, but in the middle and highex 'walks. The most promineat featore which distiagalshed the mnen of Manchester was an intense, energetic,
determied attention to business and the. occupation of ordinary life. There it was life in earnest, and he loved earnestness. Another distinctive feature in Manchester ife was good common sense and sound judgment. Their Liverpool friends were disposed to imitate London and disparage Manchester-to speak of the " gentlemen" of Liverpool and the "men" of uanchester; but h vwould rather nave a good sensible man than a gentleman who set up for more than toe was; Again, there was abont Manchester men and} anchester lifeagreat deal of honesty and unaffectedness, and disinterestedness and unpretendingkignd.es There was also agreat deal of public spirit, energy, and enterprse. nother of anchester life was the
zeal Manchester had shown, and was still showing, in the caltivation of the arts and in the increase of information and intellgence among all classes of the community. The last feature on the bright side of the picture to whieh the lecturer alluded was large-hearted liberality and generous muniacence. A person had only to make out a good case to meet with princely generosity and liberality. .urnig to the dark si e of the picture, the lecturer said that there was in Manchester a too intense znd sustained application to business-an absorption in its pursuits, Manchester life was largely-too largely-A mere mercantile life, many having no idea beyond business. The spirit of competition led to speculation and commercial gamblinr,-to people trading without capital, and to L azxtent Iond. their means. But bsdes that5 there was a great deal of actual
ramblaig. behadheaTrd it said thgat Manchester ws lookced Upon as an authority in horseracing atnd stakesi. He concludedbyallng to what ho very much regretted to see, tho growing love for the excitement of diversion and amusement, aun the growing taste for ostentatious display at entertainments. A&gainat all these dark phases he earnestly warned his audience. A hearty vote of thanks tva accorded to the lecturer at the close.

Rough Notes, &c., Of A Tour From Moscow To The Crimea, Odessa, Bessarabia.
ROUGH NOTES, Kc., OF A TOUR FROM MOSCOW TO TBE CRIMEA, ODESSA, 13ESSAP.A)IA.
(FROM OTUR RPPI1AT.
We are trundling along to Orel in our tarantasse. The serfs whom we pressed into our service by Means of liberal menaces on the part of Walter, whose Government uniform is a hind of material guarantee that he will keep his word in regard to promissory notes of kicking and flogging, are still ltaring in mute surprise at the oleaginous one Eoulble note with which we have literally greased the palm of the foremost man among them all, and nre considering what manner of Tchinovinks these 3Englishmen roust be who pay " peasantse for work and labour done in the matter of hoisting a tarantasse to its side and up to the height of the Wvheel nave, and pay them with many copecks. The Vamschik, uttering wild cries, makes the thong of his long-lashed, short-handled, and unwieldy whlip ily delicately over the ears of the 'wheelers, and urges them to the top of their speed; and the little boy who acts as postillion on the off leader is equaUy energetic in pressing on his well-whacked steed; so that we go bumping, howling, and rolling along at the rate of some nine miles an hour, which is a very good speed in Russia, or, indeed, for horsepower travelling in any country in the world. And What do we see out of the window of our tarantasse ? I am seatedl on the front cushion, and sit vith my back to the horses. It is my place to-day, for, with the innate sense of justice which is cbaracteristic of our race, we, like Irish bishops, sit by rotation; that is, tho men occupy the hind, and one the fore seat; the man who fills the righthand side of the back cushion to-day will move to the'front seat to-morrow, and take the place of the late occupier, who will go to the left-hand side of the back cushion for that day, and who will abandon his seat for the front cushion the day after to-morrow. Thus the short-legged traveller gets one day outof three of greatrepose and delectation, and the two long-legged parties have each a little relaxation of their miseries and extension of their legs for 24 cut of the 48 houirs. As I look out of our grimy little window I see strange sights, which remind me cf what I beheld some 13 years ago in the county of Kerry in the kingdom of Ireland. We pass by wretched hamlets scattered as if from the skies in frequent bunches by the roadside. There are from 20 to 50 hovels in each, and in all respects they are like Irish cottages of the worst class, such as existed in the good old times, not an eighth of a century ago, in the south-west of West Britain-in a'l respects, that is, of external dirt, and mud, and squalor, but differing from them in that they possess windows with panes of glass or horn, or s^raped sheepskin, or greased paper, and chimneys which actuaUy do carry off some of the smoke of the rude stoves and Saxon fireplaces inside. The houses are made of logs of wood, fashioned by the hammer and dovetailed together with considerable dc:xterity. The intersticcs between the logs are ililed with moss or dried grass and roots, and the exterior is then rudely plastered. The roof is comrosed of masses of rushes, straw, and weeds, piled, aecording to the exigencies which arise from time to time, in rough flocks on the framework, and held down by forks of birch. As they are high and angular, this inmmense mass of raggedness is the more conspicuous, and gives the dvwelling an oppearance of abject wigwam barbarism not UE uahiv seen in habitations in those parts of tle wvorid soi-disant civilized. A rude wooden porch before the door shelters the people fres the heat of the sun in summer and breaks t] e rush of the icy winds of winter; and two cr three vvindows, provided -with wooden shutters, admit the light of day into the residence tbrouah bleary, bullFeyed greenish glass, or through tAe substitutes I have mentioned. We wil visit the interior one of these days to come, but at present w-e can only soe the outside, and its entozuroge Of cliolmous swine rooting and grubbing up the soil which lics below Eome inches of dark-coloured mud, of vegetable gardens containing forests of huge white cabbages, and of outhouses built of straw and csiers, and Eurrouinded by deformed and shapele,s -taclhs of rich hay. There is scarcely any outdoor wvi k to be done, or at least being done, and the yeaiants, men and women, are loitering listlessly abci.t the viHlage. Possiblytheynmaybelove-making after their fashion, for there is one great lout of a fcol'w in jacl;boots and a flat cap and long nightgov rny sort of coat paying particular attention to a crc ativre in longer jaclkboots and shorter coat, whose I eud is covered by a sort of helmet of coarse white calico tvisted over it, and tied under the chlin inst ead of a cap, and whose face is destitute of beardl, and rozsibly they will be married next week if my Iord likes the match ; and he is tolerably sure to ar prove, for my Lord wants serfs just now, and is as anxiul's to increase his stock and to make up for tIe enormous waste of his " paysans" in the war as was ever English squire to get up his pheasants after a little overshooting' and a murderous batiue toe many in the season. WVe are still on a good c: useway, and the younger part of the population sIem to be employed in repairing the road, by sh1ovelling river sand and stones into the ruts or filling up the holes with broken fragments. The ccsnti yat each side of usis even at this season what is called by young ladies " pretty." It swolls in fine sneePing undulations away to the horizon, and its ridgoes and vales are nmarked by patches of trees, wh ch thicken and increase as we get on towards Sergiewskoje, till they attain the dignity of forests and the trees reach their full maturity in size and height. Many streams cross the road and flow in the fertile valleys between the ridges of the rising gr( m 'd, and the soil shines black and fresh in the setting sun, just shot, as it were, with the faint
co e(n of the crop of grain which is just springing up, to biniy its head in the snow for the next four -onths. It is remarkable that one sees no mansions os ccur.try seats near the villages. The Russian h ndlords are too often absentees, and either have r o residences on their estates or permit thosa built by their forefathers to fall into the has es of their agents and head men. Still 3ncre remnarkable, in such a country as Russia, is the ab.ence of churches. The hamlei s are numerous, and contain a tolerably large population, to judge of it even from the roadsic'e; aiid yet one may Journey for several mniles before a churclh is visible, and then it will be found to he in the neigbbourhood of a town or large village. TI e trains of carts-some drawn by oxeii, others by hardy and finely-shaped horses-pass continuously along the road, and indicate that a great traffic is carried on, as is iiidc.ed the case between Iloscow and Ore]. There is the usual movement of soldie y along the highway-]ittle groups of veterans or yF ulg en oiL their march for home from the regiments reduced at Mloscow or in the government of T,ila. They are all facing towards the south, and as the tarantasse passes most of them halt and take of' their fat, peakless caps to salute the great men inside; for to have a Government courier and a tarantasse eran n by six horses was to them an outwai d sign of greztne, s, alnd they saluted on specu-

"T'011 I 810u>lltI1 l-aYe taidl that the Maste_r o-f the posts at Moscowv W-a so obliging as to give Walter a letter enjoining all the postmasters at stations to giv e uis horses with despatch, and in such numbers as might be required, and that w e had availed ourselves of this authority to take two horses in addition to the number of four with which we started, in consequence of the heaviness of the road and the greater heaviness of the vehicle which rolled over it. The-e poer limping eoldiers were to me objects of compassion, for I could not but think tbrough what violent phases they have to pas*-one day to be dresj with Ecrupulous care and neatness, to be brushedvdlown and rubbed up by their sergeants, to be called by endearing names by their oflicers, to be exhibited by their lord, their Gorsudar, their Deity on earth, to his loving brothers and cousins-nay, to be spoken to in lknd tones by Lis very voice, and to hear themselves lauded by those divine lips which are the fountain of all power, and authority, and favouir, and glory for more than 60,000,000 of the human race; to be ga7ed at with admiration and terror such as must
be gratifying to the Imperial keeper of such a fine menagerie; to be majrched off with the praises of crowned heads and great warriors ringing in their ears to the sound of the martial music of their own voices; and then to enjoy a good meal, as
hungry Russians can, and to turn in afterwards into
clean and comfortable beds; then to be hurried off ' oni a long and dreary march, laden beyond human strength, to be stripped of their fme uniform, to be urged on through the rain and the summer heat and the winter snowv till they arrive just in time to be slauglhtered, like cattle, in some dreadful battlefield, or to endure the stupendous labours of the immortal siege-to be rewarded bv the boon of liberty if they are serfs, and to find that liberty means starvation, or to be sent adrift at the end of the war, to plod their way as they can to their distant viUages, a few halfpence in their pockets and a ribaud on their breasts; or to lie down and die exhausted on their weary journey; for they have neither pensions nor asylums, and those who pity are too poor to help them. The only clothing of ,nany of these men was the regimental forage cap, their long gray greatcoats, generally threadbare and in bad condition-summer trousers, the ends of which are tucked into Wellington boots-often in bad marclling order-their fare is water, for they can seldom afford the very cheap luxury of a draught of quass -bread black, hard, and bitter, yet wholesome, onions and cabbage soup as long as their copecks last. Sometimes a man is allowed to take away his knapsack whon it is very old, but their store of necessaries is usually contained in a small bundle, slung on a stick, or tied in Manchester cotton round their necks. A few of the men we saw to-day wore the Sebastopol medal and riband. A body of Cossacks, about 200 in number, whom we encoiuntered near Czern, had only just left the Crimea, and judging from the appearance of men and horses their march had been very distressing. Many of the horses were lame, and the dismounted soldiers who led them were in equally bad condition. They had marched at the rate of 18 miles a-day from the town of Ekaterinozlov, on the Dnieper, and were in hope of being sent back to their colonies or to the Caucasus in the spring of next year. As we drove on we observed that some houses ininearlyeveryvillageweredeserted, but whether it was the effect of cholera or of war that had made them tenantless we could not learn. Nothing on earth-not solitude or the desert-is so melancholy as an abandoned and ruined human habitation, and here we passed them every verat, the doors broken off the hinges, the windows boardsd up or falen in, and the roof tumbling down or gone into the body of the humble cottage. WYe passed many stations with queer names-Potemkino, Pokrowskoie, ar,d so on, and our six horses exerted thenmselves most creditably to drag themselves and the tarantasse along; but it is fair to say that our speed was diminished greatly by the delays in getting them changed, and that on the average we did not travel six miles an hour, stoppages included. Two things never abandoned us the whole of our journey-the verst posts and the telegraph wires. In the matter of verst posts we might in the old coaching days have taken an excellent lesson from the Russians. Instead of a dutmpy milestone, with an il cut and almost illegible name and figures at the bottom, there is a square post, some 15 feet high, with a quadrilateral slab of wood at the top, on one side of which is painted in large black figures on a white ground the number of versts from the place you have left, and on the other the number of versts from the place you are going to, and as the post and the angle of the square are always placed towards the road, you can see the figures for a considerable time before and after passing the post. These verst posts often serve to indicate the direction to the traveller rather than to point out the road, and they are painted in broad ribands of black and white, separated by a narrow streak of red-the Russian national colours-which distingguish them from stLmps of blighted trees or accidental posts and pillars a long way off. For all ordinary purposes the verst may be talken as equal to two-thirds of an English mile, and as equivalent to a kilometre. The telegraph wires are conducted along very fine straight and taU posts of greater strength andl solidity than we see in this country, and they are aboout 40 yards apart, so that from v erst post to verst post there are 25 telegraph posts, Unless we wanted to get out to eat or drink at the post stations we did not leave the tarantasse, for the roads were still nmuddy, and each station is very li}:c unto the other, only differing, perhaps, in the intensity of the odours inside, or in the Saint on the walls, or in the appearance of the postmaster. At 2 o'clock on the morning of the day after we left Orel, at the Gth stage on the road, we were awakened by the consciousness that there wvas a great delay in getting out the horses, and on looking out of the tarantasse unusual commotion was visible in the posthouse. Lights were gleaming in the windows, and a handsome travelling carriage with silvered lamps, the light of which was obscuredby the clouds of vapour from the smoking horses, was dLrawn up at the steps, surrounded by all the spare yamschiks of the establishmnent. Several officers, whose vehicles were behind the grand carriage, were giving orders, to which they enforced attention by smart kicks or whacks with their canes all around tlen), and Walter, the dauntless antagonist of postmasters, was standing with his cap off in a state of evident prostration. On inquiring what was the cause of the delay and of " the row," we i,eard that it was the sudden arrival of his Imperial Highness the Grand Duke Michael Nicolaievitch, wrho was on his way to Orel on some mission of inquiry which boded no good to whoever was found out, and so we waited till the Grand Duke came forth from the station and dashed off with all his followers into the darkness. It was, of course, much more difficullt to obtain horses at each succeeding station, and at 7 o'clock on Tuesday morning, October 7, we woke up to find ourselves entering the town of Mtzensk. Notwithstanding its name, which in its accurate orthography is unpronounceable, Mtzensk is a very picturesque little place. It is situated on the confluence of the Mezna and Soussa, abounding in churches, whose gilded and brightly-coloured cupolas and white pillars and u alls, stucco though they be, gave it a grand air ; it seemed, as the wide expanse of green roofs glittered in the morning sun, to be a large town, but in reality it only contains 7,000 inhabitants, and is a place of little importance, except for its manufacturcs and the produce of its fields and artificers which are similar to those of Orel. The soil seems very rich, and the houses are surrounded with kitchen and fruit gardens. No part of Russia is better cultivated; the crops of corn, hemp, tobacco, and the quanitities of vegetables of all kind grown in the government of Orel are considerable. The gardens of Mtzensk are filled with beehives, and the country between it and Orel is admirably calculated for produce of all kinds. Forests of firs, and elms, and birch are abundant, and aspens, alders, limes, and willows border the streams, or dot the slopes of the meadows, in which large flocks of sheep and goats and herds of cattle are grazing contentedly, in spite of the bands cf democratic squeaking pigs which run about u pturning the fair award with their ugly snouts, and grubbing up radical nourishment from the loam beneath. But, though the aspect of the country inmproved, not much change for the better could be detected in the appearance of the villages, or the air of the inhabitants. Now and then a large bo;rd, with the double-headed eagle emblazoned thereon, in the attitude of looking both ways at once for poachers, announced that we were on the lands of the Houlse of Romanoff, and were driving through an Imperial forest; and we heard that
there was good shooting inside-wolves, hares, foxes, tree grouse, and deer. The sky became overCast, and rain fell at intervals after 10 o'clock, and at 12, when we entered the town of Orel, the weatber was very threatening and the wind very ccld. There were, as usual, two large pillars at each side of the road at the entrance to the town, with a huge lever bar stretched across them to prevent any cart passing till the soldier douanier had got out of his sentry-box and searched for articles liable to the octroi; bult there was not, as usual, a triumphal arch of wood, painted to resemble marble, inside this barrier. On these pillars the Imperial eagles, the arms of the Government, and the extent of its jurisdiction are generally engraved, and the great proprietors sometimes resort to the same mode of showing the limits of their possessions. Indeed, this Eort of information is iiberally given in Russia, and as to the distance of one place from another, I assure you there is no attempt at concealment or subterfuge, but, on the contrary, every anxiety is shown to tell the truth. At every stantsia, or ost station, there is a board to inform the traveller how far he is from St. Petersburg, MoscOw, Odessa, and other large cities, and to show him the distance from the adjacent stations as well. The tarantasse rumbled over a friahtful pavement, to which a corduroy road would lave been as satin, through a suburb of one-storied cottages and houses, drawn out in vast wide shteets of indefinite length, cutting
each other at right anp,les with mathematical precision, and inhabited, if one were to judge from the people in the streets, at the rate of one human being to the half-mile. Then we debouched on the market-place, which was occupied by staUs, in which the vendors of fruits, melons, cabbages, ropes, boots, onions, taUowv, wax, nails, and such articles, had taken up their quarters and vere driving-and very difficult to drive it was, being a meagre, hard-mouthed, troublesome beast-their trade with a scanty gathering of purchasers. The long street still grew out past the market-place; and next we came to the Bazaar, or Gostinnoi-dvor-a rectangular building,with a covered walk supported on pillars outside the shops, and runniing along the four sides, and with numerous cross streets running from one side to the other, protected from the weatLer by a roof, so that visitors can walk from end to end, or any way they please in the bazaar, without fear of rain or sun. When we get near the end of our journey we shall have something more to say of these bazaars, but at present we are bent on getting out of Orel as fast as we can, for there is apparently nothing to recommend it as a residence.
Many churches did we pass, and many fine detached mansions with pilars of stucco, and various mammals of plaster of paris, in different stages of decay, before their stately doos; many houses and shops with gaudy representations of the articles sold therein painted on the windows or outside the door, before we arrived at our hotel. The waiter, with evident satisfaction depictedonhis unwashedcountenance, removed his papiros from his mouth to inform us we couldnot get in,for the house was quite full,and sO we were obliged to turn round the corner and take refuge in the Posthouse Hotel, kept by one Jodan, to which I recommend al travellers who are not particular about dirty windows and spiders ht the bedrooms, provided they can get a decent dinner. We found in this hotel an actual eating-room and a bill of fare, but there was no bell to summon the domestics, and no domestics to come when shouted for, and no chance of ordering or getting anything to eat without an interpreter, as the articles on the caffe were al named in Slavonic characters. After a hard struggle we were rewarded by a basin of " atchi," or cabbage soup, a Russian beefsteak, and a bottle of odd wine, which might be made, I think, with a flask of Day and Martin and a glass of brandy. Then it was discovered that the tarantasse was falling into pieces, and an artificer of renown in Orel declared it would take him some hours ere he could fix a screwplate and a nut to the eccentric vehicle. The day became every moment more raw and cold, and rain fel now and then, but nevertheless our little party promenaded through some of the streets of the enormous town, and took a walk in the public gardens, which, with] exceUent taste, the Russians attach to aU their cities. The spires, domes, and cupolas of 23 churches are visible from the elevate. boulevard outside these gardens, and there is also a large college for the education of young men intended for the church near the largest of these edifices. Every town in Russia which is the seat of a government, like Orel has a regulation number of hospitals, gymnasiums; lyceums, institutes, and State buildings, and Orel has its full share of them. There are some of the "young gentlemen" below there walking through the mud with great dignity. They wear, as you see, cocked hats, with a cockade of the Imperial tricolor at the side, uniform coatees of dark green, with red or purple facings and upright collars, a smali dress sword, uniform trousersof dark green, tightly strapped over their boots, and over all the invariable universal long cloth cloak, with collar gathered round the ears. These youths are intended for civil professions. They are followers of Galen or Themis notwithstanding sword and cocked hat, but the lanky lads with spectacles and shakoes close to them are students at some military college, and already pass by the civilians with contempt. The weather drove us back to the hotel, where we lay down on the hard sofas and rested our battered bones til 6 30, when the tarantasse was once more pronounced fit for the road. It is very likely that Orel may present an attractive appearance in summer, but with winter pursuing us from the north we could see little to invite us to prolong our stay. The journey, after all, was made not for pleasure, or as an ordinary travelling excursion, but to find a speedy road out of Russia; and, as it was so late in the season when I started that a voyage in the Baltic seemed not very desirable, the route by Odessa and the Danube seemed preferable to the long and dreary road from Moscow toWarsaw,thehorses on which were all in a miserable condition in consequence of the heavy posting night and day during the coronation fetes.
Orel feeds Moscow with corn, and in its granaries are accumulated the grain crops of Little Russia. The inhabitants make tallow and soap, leather, rope yarn, cordage, linen, and canvass, and are rich in
oney, woo], sheep, horses, pigs, and oxen. The river is navigable for barges of 40 tons and upwards, and there is a little forest of long slender masts visible at the bridge which crosses the stream waiting to receive or discharge their cargoes. The first post out of Orel was 20 vernts, -which our horses got over in about two hours, and on our way we crossed a large stream and traversed for several miles a sombre forest of firs, elms, and beech, which we heard afterwards was famous for its game of all kinds and sizes. What became of the Grand Duke-whether he arrived at Orel, passed through it, or remained behind, must be a mystery for ever to us. The people at the hotel never heard even of his arrival in their town, and all traces of him along the road vanished. However, we were quite satiszfed with the selfish assurance that we were getting on steadily towards Kharkoff, and that we had now reached a degree of hardihood which rendered us indifferent to the incessant persecutions of our tarantasse, and enabled us to summon sleep at our will. At every stage there was the same process to go through. The postmaster had to read the directions of the Moscow Postmaster-General, then to quarrel with Walter about horses, then to enter our arrival, and the time and mainer of it, in a big book; then to go out and kick up the yamschiks, who ca4ie blundering out into the light of the lamps, rubbin& their eyes and hugging up their sheepskms about tlem like great owls suddenly driven into bright sunshine; then came a great unharnessing of *the horses and a slow dribbling of quadrupeds out of the gaunt, ricketty stables, till the number of six was accomplished, and the process of knotting and splicing the rope harness commenced again. The drivers and postillions were changed at each stage, and we were liberal to them in the matter of drink money, but they never evinced the least astonishment at the sight of a SO-copeek piece, althouggh their fee from a Russian would have been about a third or fourth of that amount. Sometimes we got the somovar, and had a glass of tea, which is the only comfort or luxuiry the post-house affords.
There were always people in the rooms waiting for horses-generally officers muffleedc up in their cloaks, all impatience to be off, and breaking out into eruptions of volcanic wrath against the unhappy postmaster at short intervals; sometimes civilians tehinovniks going to their governments, or Go vernment employes travelling on business; sometimes Jew merchants or Russian merchants. Whoever they were, it was always observable that the officer and the civilian seldom spoke to each other, and that there was no attempt at general conversation on the part of the company. Each man or party sat in moody silence, smoking and drinking tea, or Joined in a common chorus of anathemata
against the postmaster. It was not unpleasant, however, to get out of the carriage and warm one's blood in the heated room at the expense of a little outrage to the nose. The night had set in very cold, and there was a bitter wind blowing which nearly froze Walter and the courier stiff, notwithstanding that they were wrapped up in sheepskin coats and provided with warm gloves, boots, and caps, and they were as glad as ourselves to get down and collect a little caloric for the next voyage from the grateful stoves. Our appearance attracted little notice. After a good honest stare at the strangers, the Russians resumed their ordinary attitude of unobservance and their nil admirari expression, which were as complete and as profound as those of the best bred Orientals in the world. Occasionally we were asked many ques-
tions, but they referred rather to our vlsit than to ourselves, and an interchange of deas and cigars eserally sent us offfrom the post-house in exellent uniour with each other.

The LORD MEAYOR read the folowing letter amid cheer.
"X3 Carlton-gardens, Dec. 22, ISS.
o" My Lord - I have had the honour of receiving through the hands of the Town-Clerk the copy of a resolution. passed unanlmousy at a Commou Council holden on the ISth inst., for which I have to request that your Lord--hip wiU convey to th3t body tnio expreusion of my deepest gratitude.
In the performance of the duties of my late ofiric, in the proseoca of so independent and sopular an assembly, it is Impossible to hops that the course I hare felt boaund to take can In every case be esual:y acceptable to itq mes.bers, and I am deeply seneibie, therefore, of the kindness and forbearance to which I can alone attribute the unanimity of so flattering a testimony to my serrices.
th The position which I held as Recorder of the city was one with the distinctions and advantages of which I mnight well be coutent, but when advancement was most graciously offered to me in the service of theCrown Ifelt that ought not toreject It; and Itrust that Imaytake tbis resolution as a proef that I have not forfeited the good opiniot
of the public-3pirited body from whose service I have been thus un-
It is not without sincere regret that I foresee the partial interruption of many of the associations of the past six years, but I Shal* never forget the many kindnesses I hare received or the generousupport ant confidence afforded me bs the members of the corporation, in all its branches; from this source I derived strength in the administraties of justice. and effectual encouragement in the performance of the other various duties of my office.
* In whatever position I am laced I shall ever preserve a lively sense of the honour done me by the city of London, and ever cherishi a deep interest in the welfare of her oorporation.
nIhave the honour to remain, with great respect,
My Lord, yours most faithfully,
"J. A. STUART WORTLEY. The Right Hon. the Lord Mayor.'
The letter was ordered to be entered on the journals of the court.
THE ELECTION OF CO3DION SERJLUNT.

THEB MTE OF SMITHFIELD-MAIRET.
Sir J. DuKE presented a petition gigned by the ward clerk of Farringdon without on behalf of the householders of the ward, aUeging that the unoccupied state of the late Smithfield-market was an injury to the trade and property of the neighbourhood, as well as a loss to the corporation, and suggesting that the site should be appropriated to the ,urposes of a dead-meat market. H ' said that nothing could be more conducive to the public interests than the erection of a large deadmeat market in Smithfield, and he thought he was right in saying that the Government was not altogether opposed to the project, although it had been somewhat checked by the authorities of the hospitaL He moved that that part of the petition which related to the erection of a dead-meat market should be referred to the Markets Improvement Committee, who, he was sure, would give the matter their best consideration. (Hear, hear.) He also moved that two other portions of the petition should be referred, respectively, to the Improvement and City Lands Committees. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. Deputy OBBILRD, in seconding the motion, said that if the site of the late Mleet Prison were built upon, the parish of St. Bride would be saved at least 1,0001. in the shape of poor rates. Farringdon market was a place with a name, but without business, and was a disgrace to the entire neighbourhood.
Mr. Alderman ROSF-As a magistrate I find a great and an increasing difficulty in knowing what to with the boys of London. They have no place to resort to for the purpose of recreation. They are compelled to play about the streets, to break windows, and they do a great deal of damage to property. Forwantofaproperplacetowhich they might repair to recreate themselves and improve their physical as well as their mental powers they frequently get sent to prison. It seems hardly credible that we have no suitable spot upon which our enornous popuation might find recreation. (Hear, hear.) I believe that our ancestors were right in universally preparing their schools and their grounds first to improve the mind, and then to give the lads the opportunity of improving their physical structure. I am perfectly sure that unless some arrangement is made by which the lads of this immense metropolis may have some means of exercising their physical powers the result will be that you v-ill have a great difficulty, which at the present moment is almost insurmountible, in dealing with your juvenile population. (Hear, hear.) I believe that you might so economize the space in qucstion as that you should have the co. operation of the hospital authorities. You might have a space left for the ventilation of the city, and a considerable portion would then bh left which might be easily and readily adapted to the useful purposes of a market. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. Deputy BARNARD said that the unoccupiea condition of Smithfield was a very great nuisance to the public, many young thieves being in the constant habit of congregating there. He should very much like to see the worthy Alderman pay a visit to Farnngdon-market in the dusk of the evening, where young people of both sexes, of the most vicious character, were in the habit of congregating, the police having no power to disperse them, and the beadle having finished his day's work and gone home.
Mr. Ailderman RosEl.-I have been there, and that is the reason why I ventured to make what I hope will not be considered unimportant suggestions.
Mr. GR.Ut said he hoped the petition would be entertained.
Mr. WVOOLTORTON said he had been living in the immediate vicinity of Smithfield for some 14 years, and could bear testimony to the great injury that resulted to trade from the space being left unoccupied. It was a disgrace to the corPorati On that it should be left vacant.
Mr. Deputy BOWVER.-TII Government have given us no permission to work up old Smithfield for any useful purpose which the corporation wFished to carry into effect from the time it ceased to he a market. He (Mr. Deputy Bower) moved by way of amendment, that the portion of the etiti on relating to tho construcion of a market be reFerred to the Markets Committee, instead of to the Improvement Committee.
The amendment having been seconded,
MIr. H. L. TA.%oLoB.-We are now considering a great and important matter, and I am not at all surprised to find that theward of FarringdonWithouthave come to urge the Court to do what it can to remove the stigma which appears to apply to the corporation with respect to Smithfield-market. I believe it to be the universal opinion, not merely of the members of this Court, but of the inhabitants of Farringdon Without and everywhere else, that no better appropriation can be made of the late Smithfield-market than for the purposes of a dead meat market. (Hear, hear.) That, I believe, was the view entertained by the present Chancellor of the Excheqner, than whom no man knows better the requirements of the inhabitants of London in respect to markets. It was his opinion that that site should be so appropriated, but his views were in some measure sbaken by the newly-constituted Board of Health, who were worked upon by the authorities of St. Bartholomew Hospital. At present we are conferring with the Government upon the subject. We expect to meet again very soon to receive a communication from the Home Secretary, who will have to consider the subject. If the question of tbc appropriation of the site had merely rested with the corporation, and if it had been a matter which was not in dispute between the Minister of the Crown and tho corporation, I have no hesitation whatever in saying that little cause would have existed for the inhabitants of Smithfield to address this Court. (Hear.)
Mr. Ross said it was disgraceful that such a valuable site should be seized upon by a parcel of persons who made it a scene of riot. If the corporation did not establsh a market there, the same thing wonld be done with Newgate-market that occurred to Smithfield-the Government would bring in a bill to destroy it, and thereby the corporation would be losers.
Mr. LAwrLEY called upon the Conrt to lose no time in appropriating the site, which, in its present condition, was a gnevous injury and nuisance to the neighbourhood. It was a standing disgrace to the city, and yet wnthin a stone's throw of it was valuable iand which was every day becoming of greater isuportance.
The amendment was pist and lost.
'llhe original motion was then carried by a considerable majority.
iTHE CEETRAL CRIMINAL COURT.
Upon the motion of Mr. Alderman RosE, the following motion was ordered to be placed at the head of the paper of business for the next Court
'That the present state of the courts and pasesages of the se3sSons hunee, Old Bailey. and the places where prisoners are assembled before being called up for trial being very inconvenient, and productive of g.reat mischSet to wvitaeies. crisners, *nd others ucnnected with the .ministratmon of justice, it be referred to the City Lands Committee to consider the euiect and to obtain plans and estimates for remodellng the entire building and approaches, and forthSwith lay the same bxfore this Ceut, with a view of remedying tho eevS complained of"
Mr. Deputy BOw\ER brought up the foUlowing report, which was agreed to without discussion:

The Affray In The Mersey.
THE AFFBA Y IX THE AIERSEY.
LIVERPOOL, JA2N. 22.
The adjourned hearing of the case in connexion with the collision between 16 seamen and the first and second mates of the Amedcan ship James L. Bogart while lying in the Mersey, was resaumed this afternoon at the Birkenhead Police Court, before the Rev. R. M. Fielden, Msjor-Geaer.el the Hon. S. E. Cost, and other magistrates.
At the last hearing the Court declined to enter into the charge of mutiny, as being ont of their jurisdiction, and they found that there was no case of assault against 1.3 of the 16 of the crew, but they retained the second mnte (Peter Camp bell) and three of the men, Lott Hyatt, Jeremiah Jones, and Joseph Williams (coloured mea) in custody, it having been asserted that they had used dangerous weapons. Peter Campbell used a revolver, and wounded James Christie, who lies at the Birkesihead lolpitsl in a dangerous state. The first mate (James O Fnrber) h3d his head split open during the struggle. He was removed to the Northern Hospial, Liverpool, and is not expected to recover.
Mlr. Harmer appeared f.r the American Consul - Mr. Campbell and Mr. Snowball for the coloured prisoners having been retained by sonle philanthropic gentlemen in Liverpool to defend the crew ; and MIr. Conway, barrister, for the shipping master.
John Robinson, the boatswain (a coloured, man), was brought up under a warrant. Being sworn he said, on Saturday he shipped on board the J. L. Bogart for Mobie, as an able seaman. He signed the articles in the office of Mr. Martin, shipping iaster. Went on board on Sunday morning, the vessel tben lying in the Mersey. On Monday morning, about half-past 6, the crew turned to, witness then having been made boatswain. On nustering the men he found that there was a crew of 18, with himself, but not including the captain and two mates. The first mate (O'Furber) told him to take what men he wanted forward, and to order two others to the foretopgallant rigging. At this point two men, one of whom was James Christie, the wounded man atthe hospital, were complaining to the first and second mate that they had not shipped for thie James L. Bogart, bht for the Robin Hood, ound for Antigua. Those two men were bro.ught aboard on Sunda ni bt, in a boat, the hands in which hailed for the Robin Hood, and the second mate of the J. L. Bogart hailed back " This is the Robin Hood.' When the two men complained on Monday niorning the two mates began toill-use them and others with their fists and thq butends of their pistols. The captain was not on board. The men had not refased to work. They ran on the forecastle, and the second mate followed, and shot at them with the revolver. They each fired three shots. Campbell (the second mate) shot Christie in the thigh. The mates, after firing six tines, went aft, reloaded, and commenced firing again. O'Furber loaded both the pistols, and gave one to Campbell. There was no resistance by the men until the mate shot Christie. Campbell's pistol snapped foar times, and the fifth time he shot Christie, O'Furber then went up to Jeremiah Jones (a negro), and shot at him, but the contents of the pistol missed. Jones then struck the first mate with a capsta,bar, which he picked up after he had been shot at. (Thecapstan-bar was produced. It was stained with blood.) Campbell was armed with a cutlass as well as a revolver. In *oing forward he dropped the cutlass, and Lott Hyatt (a
alay) picked t up. saw the mate illuse John Battiso (a fine-looking negro), and tbey afterwards put him in irons. Joseph Williams (a negro), one of the prisoners was kicked, knooked down, and stamped upon by the second mate before the affray commenced.
Mr. Snowball contended that Jones used weapons only in celf-defence, and that, under the circamstances, he could not be held responsible, even if the first mate died.
James Harrison, the pilot, confirmed the statement of the boatswain in every particular.
Mr. Campbell, in addressing the Court, asserted that if the first and second mate had been left deadon deck it would have served them right. (Applause.)
The Bench thought there was no case against Hyatt or Williams, but that Jones should be remanded seeing that the life of O'Fnrber was still in danger; they Lad no doubt that if O'Eurber were to die, and Jones were to be committed, ajury would acquit him. If he should be pronounced out of danger, Jones would be at once acquitted, and O'Furber would be charged with felonious shooting
Williams and Hyatt were discharged, but Jones was admitted to bail to appear again when required. The bail was found by the same philanthropic gentlemen who had provided the legal assistance.

THE SUBALTERN'S FRIEND.-If Sir Colin Campbell
THEs SunALTERN's FBRxD.-If Sir Colin Campbell be the adviser of the new duties required of junior officers, be is the best friend they have known for many a da7. Idleness in the army is not only the mother of mischief izn general, but it is the most special parent of extravagance and debt, which have ruined the prospects of hundreds of yong men. He that keeps their bodies exeroised and their minds employed in salutary and improving occupations removes them out of the way of temptations and cf the influence of pernicious habits. Their warmest ihanks are due to such a friend, and tho only thing to be regretted is that he has limited this most whole. sotne discipline to subalterns of two years' service. It would be well if it were so extended that no offier might expect to be exempt from it before he should have obtained a certificate, duly merited of having reached a considerable proficiency in the knowledge and practice of his profession. A good deal of attention has been directed of late years to the formation and supply of regimental libraries for the instruction and entertainment of private soldiers and nothing is bettor adapted than such a provision to raise the moral character of the army. Why should not a portion of that care be bestowed in cultivating the minds of their superiors in the ranks? We do not know that any kind of literary application is required of officers after they have passed tbeir noviciate examination at Sandhurst, unless an ambition should possess any of them to become qualified for a staff appointment. Then a coarse of arduous study must be entered upon. Rat withoi;t requiring any severe literary application on the part of officers, whose tino Is necessarily much engagod in active service out of doors, it would surely conduce much to their own self-respect, as well as to the estimation irt which the world is disposed to regard them, were they c bliged to keep themselves amt niveau with gentlemen who a-e advancing in other liberal professions in the usual branches of knowledge. History, geography, mathematics, languages, and the principles of natural la and of moral phhosophy are, with other things, essential to the due maintenance of their social position. Their minds should by no means be suffered to retrograde on any of these subjects* and we trust .that the schoolmaster wU1 be kept sufl.- cientiy alert, without making his presence irksome, fo make them familiar (if theyare not so already) to every yourg gentleman who bears IHr Majesty's commission.-lublin Mail.

LONDON, FBIDAY, JANUARY 23, 187.
All questions of taxation are comparative. A certain sum of money must be raised, and the question is how to raise it. It is true Mr. JosEpu HUims and other reformers of the old constitutional type used to maintain that the right order was first to determine how much money we could all spare for national purposes, and then, like children deliberating how to spend a holyday shilling, proceed to consider what we should do with it. Such a process might possibly apply to peace, but it could not to war, for no nation would ever be so mischievous and cold-blooded as to scrape together a surplus of ten miUions, and then consider which of their neighbours they could pommel with the money. The money is wanted to discharge an existing obligation, and to counteract an exhaustion in actual process. So the CCEaxor of the EXUEQL-ER first tells us that he must have the money, and then suggests the mode which he hopes wil be the least distressing to our feelings. No doubt, the Abyssinian cattle in BRUCE'S narrative bad the most intense objection to parting with a steak before the usual time; but the drivers must have the stcak, and they showed great skll and humanity in the place and manner of its extraction. That is the skill and humanity of the financier, and the fact of our bellowing under his knife and steel is not conclusive against his official dexterity. It is only a choice of evils. So, as this is the 23d of January, and Parliament meets on the 3d of next month, and as the CIIANcELLoR of the EXCHEqUER wiU soon be obliged to answer any reasonable question that any one of 653 gentlemen may choose to put to him, it is scarcely worth while to talk very strongly about the Income-tax before we know the extent of the necessary evil, and how much money is wanted. All anticipations are useless when we must shortly know the facts of the case ; and it is equally useless at this moment to protest against any tax that may happen to be gaUing us.
Even supposing it to be true, as the clhairman stated at Exeter-hall on Wednesday, that the estimates for this year wil be twenty millions less than for last, that is only one fact out of several that must be taken into account. Of itself it goes for nothing. Last year we had not only heavy taxation, but loans. Not even the gentlemen who spoke so warmly against the Income-tax oni this occasion would advise another loan, if it could be helped. It would be a confession of poverty in the face of Europe, and an example of insolvency to our children, and in both ways would be very injurious to our own present interests. But it has not been so much as suggested yet. It happens unfortunately, however, that this year the first flight of those Exchequer-bonds which Air. GLADSTONE let loose on the world will be returning home, and wiU have to be met. That can be done with other bonds, or bills; but the whole charm of the invention wil be lost if they are not paid out of revenue. Even without taking them into account, if we remember right, the CHANCETLOR of the EXCeHEQEuR reckoned on the assistance of the Incometax, at its war level, when he hoped to bring our finances al straight by the meeting of Parliament. He expected, we wil suppose, 8,000,0001. from this source. The immediate question, then, is how to raise 8,000,0001. By a new loan, throwing the cost of the late war upon future years? No. By direct taxation ? Certainly not. By letting the Income-tax Act run its course, and allowing the CHANCELLOr. of the ElxCHEQUE the benefit of the few days' delay in the ratification of the Treaty of Paris ? It certainly is not agreeable, but we are all well in harness. The war-tax does really expire at Lady-day, 1858; and, as they say it is better not to wake a sleeping dog, it may conduce to our final emancipation if we let the act take its course. What other resource is there ? One was mentioned at Exeter-hall, and has been more seriously advocated elsewvhere. It is the plan of a Property-tax. We have already discussed it at length. Parliament would take at least a whole sesmion to elaborate a Property-tax that would raise 8,000,0001. We presume that nobody would think this a wise expedient for a single Iyear, and a tomporary deficit of 8,000,0001.,
whatever its merits as a permanent iouroe of revenue. Some of the projectors, too, appear-
to have forgotten,-at least, they take no notice of the fact,-that we have already a most carefully elaborated substitute for the Income-tax, and that it is beginning to yield a good revenue. The Succession-duty was devised for this very purpose, and we are not aware that it is thought a failure. The gentlemen who address public meetings on the subject of the Income-tax would do so to rather more purpose if they showed themselves quite up to all the facts of the case. As it is, they are sometimes liable to a very short answer. Are they all aware that even the 7d. in the pound is finaUly to expire in three or four years?
The occasion is eagerly seized by those easy financiers who think to substitute a Propertytax for the whole of our present indirect taxation. In our humble opinion, much as the tax might be improved, it could never be brought to such a pitch of perfection as to bear all the burdens of the country, and yet be no load on our shoulders. Disguise it as we will, regulate it as we will, a lumping tax paid out of the year's income, or according to the income, whether it comes in or not, is mere financial bloodletting, and must reduce the system. It is the common remark that everybody is spending at least the whole of his income, -too often more ; and the wonder is how people with no great margin get on at all with their evident expenditure. Suppose, now, a man with an increasing family and increasing expenses, life assurance, schooling, better dressing, doctor's bills, perhaps some legal expenses, an occasional loes, and a few weeks' " outing" at the very cheapest rate, all to be done on 5001. a-year. He must feel it a heavy pull to have to pay 341. Income-tax every autumn; and we have little doubt that in most cases it is paid by sonie process of anticipation. But here are reformers who propose that he shall pay 501. every year that he has this income, and promise him some equivalent in the cheapness of articles now liable to duty. The proposed arrangement, however, like Sir R. PEEL'S original Income-tax, presses hard 'on a class entitled to consideration. A man with a large family and a limited income can escape much indirect taxation by the simple process of household economy. He has scarcely a bottle of wine or spirits in his house, and drinks beer, and that not strong, and never smokes a cigar. His family drink their tea weak, and tea and sugar are kept under lock and key. Such a household -will pay but little to the Exchequer, and the feeling of all ages has agreed to spare it. The Income-tax, however, and any Property-tax would make this family pay as much as the bachelor with the same income, even though the large family might be living with the dietary of a workhouse, and the bachelor might be enjoying comparative luxury. There are people who will not feel the force of this contrast ; so we beg to remind them of another working of the tax. Every sixpence of it is so much drawn from the common stock of industry. W"hy are so many thousands in the building trades now out of work? Building is stopped. Squares and streets marked out a year or two ago are suspended. Smal builders are failing. Why ? With this Income-tax pressing on them, and some apprehension of its renewal, people are obliged to save, and are not moving on to better houses quite so fast as they have usnaly done. In fact, a tax will be felt. It is so much blood taken out of you, and you will feel it. If England chooses to spend her millions in war, well and good; it was a rig,hteous cause, and happily a glorious one. But it cost money; and if the money was wanted for ships and guns it mnast be taken from houses and furniture; if soldiers and sailors were wanted, their pay must be taken from masons and carpenters. And there was no shirking the payment. Everybody has been forced to contribute his share to the war, and the engine effective for this purpose has been the Income-tax.
The country will, through its representatives,
The country will, through its representatives, soon have to decide upon the great question of domestic policy-viz., the treatment of its criminals. In proportion as the urgency of the social rnalady increases the remedies suggested increase also. Every day witnesses some new plan, or rather some modification of an old plan. " Facts " and figures" whiz around us in endless confusion. Every artifice is exhausted to exaggerate or depreciate the cost of each successive plan. In one case deductions for hypothetical profits, in another aggravations for speculative expenditure, are annexed to the bill of costs, according to the zeal twith which the advocate respectively champions transportation or imprisonment at home. Nor are there wanting those moral appeals which are always so useful in seasontng the argumentum ad crurwenam when any particular theory is to be advanced. It is to be hoped that whatever decision Parliament may arrive at may be based upon accurate knowledge and adequate deliberation, otherwise we shall have another transitory phase of criminal legislation, to be condemned and sutperseded, without any advantage to the public or any diminution of crime.
The main question will be whether the country shall revert to a comprehensive scale of transportation. In some degree or other we shall retain transportation so long as we retain Bermuda, Gibraltar, and WVestern Australia. But these will only provide for the reception of 1,200 out of an annual aggregate of about 12,000. The question is, what are we to do with the 10,000 who remain? Mr. PuanSOto and many others say,
Make the convicts work in England; give "them just enough to subsist upon; but do not " impose silence, or solitude, or moral lectures upon "them; only make them work." Others say,
" This physical infliction answers the purpose. " neither of correction nor of prevention. It is " useless, unless crowned by moral discipline and " mental instruction." These gentlemen are for school-rooms, lectures, and the whole paraphernalia of an adult academy. Meanwhile, the corporate Join BULL, not so conscious of philanthropy and philosophy as of taxes that must be paid and of houses that may be robbed, pleads that the felon may be removed to the greatest possible distance from the scene of his former and the suggestion of future crimes. He dislikes the extravagance of costly, and doubts the efficacy of the mere industrial, prisons. He wishes to be saved from the reality and from the terror of a dangerous contiguity.
Between these two principles and opinions will Parliament have to decide, and the decision so given must not be subject to constant or immediate change. It must be given for some years, at all events, and, regarding it with a view to efficiency and permanency, it must, in our opinion, involve transportation to a larger extent than many seem to contemplate as possible; for, suppose that transportation be given up, in what state shall we be? We shall start with a criminal army of more than 10,000 men. We may expect that this average will in a very few years be increased, and that it wmill go on increasing. It will be confined in prisons or prison grounds, and set to work. But what -workt In this country the public works are few, except at the dock-yards and arsenals. Shall we congregate all our criminals there ? Talk of throwilng our moral filth out on our colonies indeed ! What will that be, compared with the taint of such a concentration at home ? Has any man who recommends this ever viaXted the hulks? What more rilght have we to fasten such au infliction on Plymouth, Portsmouth, Chatham, or Milford than
on Sydney, IIobart Town, or Perth ? Again, how are we to make these men work ? If we are not to reduce the terrors of punishment to a mere variation of employment-if we are not going, professedly and ostensibly, to degrade labour to a species of punishment-we must exact from our convicts no ordinary degree of work. This must not be adjusted to the normal standard of indtustry given by the honest unconvicted labourer for daily wages. It must be something much more severe in its pressure, and, of course, immeasurably less in its remlmeration. But how is this to be effected? Public works can only be executed by aggregate bodies of men. How, then, are we to impose steady, orderly, and continuous labour upon these rough congregations? We must subject them to the unceasing vigilance and jealous custody of guards, civil and military. There must be the superintendent of works armed, with his armed subordinates. Then there must be the sentries at the outposts, and, in fact, something ike a military dep6t kept up, to prevent escapes and mutinies. What will be the cost of all this? Surely the 241. per head returned in some blue-books as the value of a convict's maintenance will not cover all these indispensable extras. We are not grumbling at the bill of charges, nor deprecating the employment of prisoners on public works. We know that under the most thrifty form the keeping of convicts is an expensive item in a nation's account, and we believe that public works are the best mode of investing the money. We only mention it now to remind those who assail transportation as a disproportionately heavy encumbrance. But we cannot legitimately find public work at home for all our convicts. The residue must be set to employments more or less sedentary, or to agricultural labour. To the last we think there is an obvious objection. It is, in the caseof prisoners, no greater exertion than that of the agricultural peasant, with the greater certainty of food, shelter, and clothing. It is the occupation of the honest man, with advantages which to the honest man are often unknown. W,Ve can imagine nothing better calculated to freeze the genial sentiments of sturdy independence throughout the land than the contemplation of our picked rascaldom punished by a course of dawdling agricultural labour. And as for other kinds of labour in prison, their imposition in this country is too often an imposture. What with an ingenuity acquired by a life of prosperous criminality, and a reserve of dexterous confederates outside, escape is far from impossible to home convicts. But even where the more adventurous arts of flight are foregone the more cunning tricks of evasion are often practised with success. Illhealth, incapacity for labour, the affectation of religious convictions, the report of the chaplain or the visiting magistrate,-aU these afford a constant facility of egress. But why speak of these abnormal gaol deliveries ? There is also the fixed and defined time of dismissal. Taken together, these different causes will flood the arca of England with an annual stream of 3,000 or 4,000 graduated criminals. Now, England is not a large country. In lineal measuremcnt it is really very small. It is mucl smaUer than many of its own colonies. It offers no distant employment, no secluded but honest abode for men on whom the taint of suspicion rests. WVe leave it to the imagination of the public to conceive what will be the state of society in this country when it is overrun with a five or six years' crop of prisoners, all of whom have been supplied with means of perpetuating their guilty associations and communicating their guilty experience, and all of whom have been taught to regard labour as a " punishment."
These things must be weighed before the Government decides on giving up a system of penal deportation, which alone can remove the proficients in felony not only from old associates, but also from fresh pupils, and whicb, if it exacts a large expenditure of money, repays the outlay by a general preservation of property and a general liberation from terror. Let the country bear this one point in mind. lVhatever be the destination or the locality reserved for these men, it cannot be like that of Paradise. Unless you are prepared to build a separate penitentiary, with separate warders and guards, for each single firstclass felon, you must be prepared for their wholesale congregation and contact ; and when they do mix you must be prepared for language, signs, and acts widely different from those of prim eval innocence. It is useless to deplore, still more useless to try to prevent, this. A society of ruffians and villainis will not, on the termination of a life passed in violence and villany, subside into the condition of meek-eyed cherubs. All that can be done is to check the extreme license of foul language and the perpetration of gross impurities. Beyond this it is hopeless to attempt aught except at an expenditure of appliances, not only burdensome to the State, but positively unjust to its most honest and industrious inhabitauts. Wherever the worst criminals are located the social atmosphere is impure, and if these men be not sent abroad the English public will eventually be obliged to submit to the infliction of severities and the spectacle of horrors such as they are now wont to associate with the worst epoch of Australia, but which are really inseparable from the treatment of obdurate and incorrigible offenders.
Under this view of the case it will be less necessary than some tlhink to insist on all the advantages of soil, climate, and products for a penal colony. We need not require figs, oranges, fine wheat, and a dry atmosphere for our most accomplished forgers, burglars, and thieves. For this reason, the-objections urged in our columns to-day by Governor RsnN-i against the selection of the Falkland Islands are, in our opinion, invalid, except so far as regards their limited area. lWhat is required is a place of security where hard labour can be imposed. An Italian sky and a fruitful soil are luxuries, not necessaries. The FaLklaind Islands seem, on the whole, adapted, so far as their space admits, for the reception of a bad class of criminals who might be employed in the shipyards. But if Parliament decide to keep the worst class in prison at home, then of course a wider area must be appointed for the reception of

As the ostriclh was said to devour iron, and negroes actualy eat baked earth, so there is food for the mind even in an appendix of tabulated results. The return of public income and expenditure for the years ending March 31, 1855 and 1856, which we owe to Mr. W. WILLIAMS, is a document sufficiently interesting to those who have a taste for facts and figures. 'We have already pointed out the chief lesson which it teachesnamely, how insignificant is the c",t of civil government when compared with the enormous drain of war. This we conceive to be the great moral of all financial statements. But there are other featui es of our financial position which are worthy of attention. There is nothing which so disappoinht predictions and confounds the wisse as the consequences of economical measures, and in no subject are we obliged to make more constant reference to the results of experience. A few isolated concluEions formed from the table before us may therefore not be Vithout interest.
With regard to the army and navy one principle i3 worthy of notice, as it explains in some degree the system on which our land forces in par-
ticular were organized before the war. It appears that the cost of an army is increased much more by its being made ready for war, with all the appliances of modem military science, than by any mere increase of men. This will be readily understood by any one who computes how comparatively small a part of the whole sum voted is absorbed by the payment of the officers and men. The great increase of expense during the war was not owing to the number of troops, but to the fact that the army was placed hurriedly in an effective state for war by the organization of auxiliary corps, the purchase of vast numbers of animals, and the provision of shelter, clothing, and. food during a long campaign. The number of effective men for the year ending March, 1855, was 113,905 ; for the next year, 137,800,-by no means an inordinate increase. But the expenditure for the former year was 5,198,6601., while for the latter it was 14,442,1511., or nearly three times as much. We can therefore well imagine that an Administration wil continually be tempted to presume on the ignorance or indifference of the public, and to give them an army numericaUy strong, but without the means of entering into active warfare. Of the 14,000,0001. spent during the year 1855-56 about 8,000,0001. may be set down as the expense of moving the troops and feeding them under extraordinary conditions, for the mere numnerical increase of the men tunder arms would have added only about 1,000,0001. to the expenditure.
The same result appears in the navy, though in less striking proportions, since from the nature of things a ship in commission is necessarily under the conditions of a regiment on active service, and therefore the difference between peace and war wil be less wide. Yet, though the effective seamen in the year endiig March, 1855, were 61,457, and in the next year only rose to 67,'91, yet the cost of the navy increased from 12,155,1471. to 18,405,5491. Almost the whole of this great increase of six millions was expended .n the construction of new armaments. The gunboats and the floating batteries, which are now laid up, perhaps never to go into blue water again, absorbed the enormous excess which the second period shows over the first. And, as shipbuilding was carried on actively during both years, we may presume that the larger part of the 12,000,0001. spent in 1854 was devoted to the construction of the line-of-battle ships that did so little. But the most striking instance of the great cost of material compared with men is to be found in the Ordnance Department. For the former period the number of effectives is 18,560, for the latter 22,931, yet the charges for the two periods are 5,284,6211. and 10,229,9321. That is, wvhile the number of men only increased 25 per cent. the cost was more than doubled. Now, if it be acknowledged that the expenditure in the late war was not unnecessary, and that our army required the creation of new establishments and the disbursement of great sums to make it serviceable in the field, it follows that we can gain no true notion of our readiness for war by merely looking to the numerical strength at any given time. It would seem therefore desirable to look less to the munber of men than to the comDleteness of the organization and equipment. At any rate, it should be known that when the nation is told that there are so many thouisand men in the country ready for its defence it does not follow that these are in any condition for active warfare, and that the money expended on them. may not have to be doubled before they can be brought into the presence of an enemy.
The details united under the heading of " Jus"tice" are of some interest. The English judicial establishment, comprising the whole body of functionaries, from the Chancellor and Chief Justices down to the clerks and treasurers of County Courts, cost in the year ending MIarch, 1856, 503,2151., of which about half is devoted to charges formerly paid out of the county-rates. The charge for Scotland is 111,1351., or more in proportion to its population than England ;while Ireland figures for 140,5811., and therefore seems to have the cheapest judicial administration, proportionally to numbers, of all the three kingdoms. When we come to police, however, it is found how small a ratio the salaries of legal functionaries bear to the cost of protecting society from crime. The metropolitan police are rated at 95,1921. for the first year, and 115,2081. for the second-an increase of 20 per cent. within 12 months. This, though, no doubt, owing in some degree to the great extension of the metropolis, is not a fact to be considered without a little surprise and alarm. The Irish constabulary police is also a force which costs a good round sum, andwhat is more-the expense has increased. In the former period it was 575,5211. ; in the latter, 643,926t. Certainly we have the right to expect a wonderful advaDce in efficiency when we see an increase of nearly 15 per cent. in a single year, in the face of a decreased population and a pacified country.
Prisons and convict services are rated at 765,6i31. for the one year, and 1,424,9071. for the next; that is, they have nearly doubled in cost. Now, " Government prisons and " convict establishments at home" shlow a decrease of more than 30,0001.; the expenses of transportation have faUen from 53,5861. to 23,0001. What, then, is the item which accounts for so enormous a total increase ? It is one which certainly calls for some explanation from those who have the power of explaining it. " Con" vict establishments in the colonies" cost in the one year 10,0001., in the next no less than 696,4391. That is, the home system established about two years ago cost during the first twelve months nearly 700,0001., and has nearly doubled the whole expense of criminal punishment. The two subjects of war and crime seem fated to meet us at every turn. Either in protecting ourselves from foreign foes or those who are among us we spend the chief part of our national income. For the punishment of crime we pay out of the funds administered by the C5HANCELLOn of the EXCOEQuJER more
than 3,000,0001. sterling annulaUy. Add to this the loss through depredations, the cost of prosecutions, the sums paid out of local rates, the time and trouble expended in the prevention or detection of offences, and we cannot doubt that the criminal community form one of the most serious burdens on the country. When it is considered that a large number, perhaps the majority, of these offenders are professionals well known to the police, it naturally occurs to the mind whether sonme stricter supervision or more summary procedure may not be necessary for the cheap defence of society.

" Bussorab, Nov. 28, 1856.
'I take advantage of a quiet moment to write you a few lines. You wil doubtless have heard by this time that wo are to have a Persian war. I had hoped this might bave been avoided, but heard on the 8th inst. that the force is certain to come up. We have heard nothinof it yet; but it must be near Bushire by this time. I wrote you a short letter on my first arrival here, which I hope you received. Since then I have been almot con. stantly on the move, and only got back lhere two days ago. Wev were driven in here by an attack made on us by the Arabs when out collecting sheep, of which I had some 2,000 with me at the time. These we saved, but lost aU our tents, baggage, and what money I had with me, fortunately only 5,300 rupees. We had to run for it, as wo were far inferior in numbers to the enemy. Taylor, the Consul here, carned me off behind him, or I should not hove been writing to you at this nsoment. This was on Sunday, the 23d, and on that day we were riding, with the exception of two hosrs' halt in the middle of the day, from 7 in the morning tiU 1 o'clock on Monday. So you soe I am still able to stand a good deal of fati^uo 1 I was, however, dreadfully tired, and am stil very stiff, but otherwise none the worse. The loss of mly clothes and bedding is a very serious affair, as they cannot be replaced here. You may imagine my state of mind when I teU you that I have not heard a word from my dear wife since I left her at Nuggur, 72 days ago, and that my last letters from you are those by the mail of the 10th of August. A steamer was sent up from Bombay and arrived here three weeks ao, but brought me no letters-indeed, they were not allowed to briDn any, for fear the intentions of the Government regarding the destination of the forc should transpire."

DUBLIN, THURSDAY MORNING. TUE NENV BISHOP.
The announcement of the name of the new bishop Yesterday took the public by surprise, for, although one of the first set down in the list of candidates, there were believed to be obstacles in the way of Archdeacon Fitzgerald's elevation which considerUAdy diminished the strength of his claims. These, however, being surmounted, the appointment must 7be regarded as creditable to the judgment of Lord Carlisle. Dr. Fitzgerald is a profound scholar and -one of the most eloquent pulpit orators in the diocess of Dublin, but being of a somewhat cold and reserved temperament be is said to be rather unpopular among the junior clergy witlh whom he -came in contact. Bating this slight drawback, it 'Would be hard to suppose that any party or section ,of a party could raise a sound objection to his well,merited promotion, The flloUwing sketch of the ministerial career of the newv bishop appears in the neutral columns of Saunders's Newsletter:_
Dr. Fitzgerald, the Archdeacon of Kildare, Professor of 2icclesiastical History in the Univerbity, Incumbent of Monkstown, near Dablin, Privata Chaplain of his Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, and also on the list of Chaplains to his Excellency the Lord Lieutenant, is Bishop elect of the Uhnited Dioceses ot Cork, Cloyne, and Ross. The Lord Lieu'tenant's letter, we believe, reached Dr. Fitzgerald on 'Tuesday evening last, and the public mind is at length , at rest by an appointment less open to cavil and -oDjection from any quarter or party in the church than would probably be that of any other clergyman -of the whole united church that could be named. Remarkable throughout a mnemnorable career for uncommen abiHty, laborious habits, profound learning, and tino6tentatious piety, the new bishop uniformly steered -clear of faction, and never committed himself to any party in the church. Even on the vexed question of isatiosnal -education in Ireland, though favourable, as is understood, to the system, he never put himself forward as its champion or apologist If, as is said in the 28th number of the ,Cautions for the Times-a paper by tile way attributed to Dr. Fit7gerald's pen-'you can never trust a party man;' -and if, on the other hand, as is stated in the same article,
a sensible and upright man who keeps himself unconnected -with party may be calculated on as likely to act on the views which you have found him to take on each point,' then it may be said that no man should be more trusted -than Dr. Fitzgerald-none should be more calculated on from his character and antecedents to act the part of a consistent, exemplary, and devoted prelate. As rector of the important parish -of Monkstown, he did not, we believe, dispute the arrangements of the parochial schools, though they had 1been conducted on the principles of the Church Education :Society; nor did he, on obtaining the living, dismiss Archdeacon Lindsay's curates, though one of them, the Rev. Thomas l.ooke, was, and still is, on the committee of that society. In the parish of Donoughiunore, in the county of Wicklow, of which he had been the incumbent previous to holding the living of St. Anne's, he actedin like manner, and permitted the schoohl to be cond acted on the old system, so -that it may be presumed his patronage as a bishop will be dispensed someiowhat according to this rule-by pronioting really meritorious ministers, not because they are partisans -of either the National Board or the Church Education -Society. Dr. Fitzgerald became scholar of the university in the year 1833, and on enteringthe ministry continued deacon for many vears in consequence of somne scruples regarding priest's orders which he found difficult to overcome. As an authorit may be said of him-'Nullum tetiigit quod nsn ornarit, as everythinlg he has written is of the highest literary ,nerit and of a varied kind. His edition of Butler's Analogy is the standard edition of that immortal work wherever the Englsh language is known. The same high character has been given of his edition of the Nicootachean Ethics of Aristotle, his Yolunte of Practica Sermons, and other works. He is the fourth of the chaplainis of his Grace the Archbishop of Dtiblin who have become bishops, the late Bishop
of l.eath, Dr. Dickenson; the present Bishop of Norwichb
Dr. Hinds; and the late Bishop of Cork, Dr. 'Wilson, having filled that position; and, in addit:on to his fitness for the mitre as a scholar and divine, the experience he has acquired -s the archbishop's chaplain must be of incalculable value in the discharge of the duties of the episcopal office. It is said that the Rev. Hercules Dickenson, rector of St. -Anne's parish, wvill be his successor as the archbishop's private chaplain, and that the Ray. Dr. Mroeran, Proessor of Moral Philosophy, T.C.D., and minister of Bethel qChurch, at Kingatowrn, wvil succeed him in the living of Monkstow n."
THE BROADSTOXE TRAIGEDY.
A circunmstance has oozed out witbin the last day -or two which, assuming the facts to be correct, will sufficiently explain the early arrest and subsequent -detention of Catherine Campbell. who, by the way, has not returned to her friends in the country, but is still in Dublin under the surveillance of the police. It is stated that a little before 7 o'clock on -the night of the murder, and on the arrival of the up-train from Galway, this woman came out of the house to the great gateway at the rear, where one of the railway police was on duty, to whom she told a plausible story of the expected arrival, by the train just then come in, of a female cousinl; and, pleading the nealected state of her dress-being wvithout a bonnet or shawl-she requested the policeman to find out her expected visitor, and accompany her back, she (Campbell) promisiDg to keep guard until his return. The distance to the end of the platform where the third-class carriages stop is not snore than 30 or 40 yards, but in the bustle andl confusion consequent upon the arrival of a train, a deal of time would be lost in the search for a country cousin; and so it turned out, for, after a fruitless inquiry, the policeman returned to his beat, and annouinced the result of his mission to Catherine Campbell, who then returned into the house. Subseqtient inquiries were made, with a view of ascertaining whether this country cousin had any -real existence, and, lier place of residence being indi-cated by Camupbell, it was found that part of her statement was coi-rect, but the woman on being interrogated positively denied that she had any intention of going to Dublin, either on the night in question or at any other time. So goes the story; but, where all official sources of informa-tion are closed to the public, and where every proceeding in connexion with the murder has been -conducted with a secrecy worthy of the Spanish Inquisition, it must be received with the same amount of reserve which attached to every incident -that has transpired since the commencement of the ;abortive investigation at the Broadstone terminus.
It appears from a statement in the MeuAnig Mait that a successor to poor Mr. Little in the office of -cashier has been at length appointed by the board -of directors, at the unassuming salary of 1501. per annum, or 501. less than the sum allotted to the deceased officer. Commentinig upon this ill-judged parsimony, a writer in the journal above named indignantly exclaims,-
" Can muen be found in this day, respectable men, of course, willing to give 1,5001. security, and to undertake a nmost serious trust in which thousands per week of public mnoney is placed in their hands, and they held responsible. if they take a base crown, a light sovereign, or a forged note, to make it good out of their own purse, for the dazzling prospect of 160l. a-year? Can any terms ade-quatel1 express the feelings with which such conduct on the part o. railway directors must be viewed ? Isit not payng a preintunt to encourage embezzlement? No doubt the grinding system is largelyearried out in these days, but this out-herods Herod-a post, too, in which one ainiable man fell a victim to his integrity, and where the murderer still stalks secure, perhaps meditating a second coup. It is stated that this reduction of 501. per year is to go towards paying the munificent donation of 2001. which the directors have voted towards the subscription now making in aid of poor Little's mother and sister-adonation so miserably small and unadequate that many respectable citizens refused to contribute to the (mid until the company shall be compelled, by the unatti'noua voice of the public, to mend their contribution, and make it somewhat more in proportion to the

The Double Murder At Walworth.
THE DOUBLE MURDER AT WALWORTH.
Every hour discoveries are made by Inspector Young and the otherofficers engaged in theinvestigation toleadto the conclusion that Bacon, and not his unfortunate wife, is the msurderer of his children. Yesterday the officers proceeded to the residence of Mr. Payne, 15, Anglesea.street,WaterlooNew Town, who is uncle to Bacon, and which Bacon, on the day before, described as his present residence, and there, among his clothes, found a pair of fustian trousers, which, on examinationi, were found to be staiced with blood in many parts. These trousers are the -very pair described by his ,wife as those worn by her husband on the morning of the murder, but she added that he also had on an apron while comnitting the act; and this would account for there not being more blood on the trousers. In corroboration of the statement about the apron, it is a fact that on the Tuesday, upon the police going into the house, they found an apron much stained with blood, and which bad been also used to wipe up somne stains of blood on the front bedroom floor. The short but awful confession made by Mrs. Bacon was written in Cook, the gaoler's, room and at his desk before her examination on Wednesday, and on writing anid signing it she handed it to that officer. Cook, on reading it, said, I This is a niostserious charge against your husband, and, for God's sake, don't make it unless it is true. You are aware tbat God is looking down aud sees what you are doing, anid pray don't make a statement that is not strictly truie." mShe replied, ' I anm perfectly well aware of the fact. It's all strictly true, and I feel that it is too bad that the innocent should suffer for the guilty." When asked his opinion respecting the sanity or iosanity of Mrs. Bacon at that time, Cook declared it to be his conviction that she was as perfectly sane as he was binmself, and, further, it was his thorough belief that * hat she stated was the trutb. In addition to her written statement Mis. Bacon made further disclosures toMr. Cook. She said that the witness Ratchford, who gave his evidence on the former examination, was quite correct when he said that he heard Bacon light the fire on the Mondaymornlag at 6 o'clock. Her husband, she said, g,t up about that time and lit the fire, leaving her in bed. She saw him take the little boy down stairs, and, hearing the child cry, she jumped out of bed, thinking something shocking had happened, and she immediately saw her husband with a bloody knife in his right hand. le immediately rushed at her and made several cuts at her throat, and wounded her as she had been afterwards found, but she kept him off as well as she could, and caught hold of the wrist of his right hand, and in some measure overpowered him ; and it was while endea. vouring to cut her tbroat that he cut his finger and inflicted the wounid before spoken of. The knife he used, she said, w-as ono of the two produced by the officer on the first examination, and, after cutting the throats of both childretn and partly cutting her own, he wiped the knife on a disheloth, throwing the latter into a basin in which there was no water. She was asked why she had not given an alarm aU this time, and her reply was that she had screamed, and, in consequence, her husband at once left the house, and she did not see him again until she saw him at Lambeth Police-court. The poor woman further said that, when left alone in the house, she was so dreadfully frightened that she knew not what to do, and did not wish to say anything about it tiUl her husband's aunt, Mrs. Payne, came on the Tuesday morning. Before going into court she be,ged that her husb^nd might not be allowed to approach or come near to her, saying she was sure, after making the statement she did, he would kill her if he had the slightest opportunity; and since her apprehusbn wh has evinced the greatest possible terror oher husband, who appears to have exercised great control and power over her. So intense is her horror now that she expressed a hope that if her husband was sent to the same gaol as herself he might have no personal communication with her, and that if he wished to send any message to her at might be in writing.
The inlhabitants of Stamford, in Lincolnshire, where Bacon was well known, will not be at all surprised at the announcement respecting him which appeared in yesterday's papers, for from the time of the murder the officers engaged a the inquiry have been inundated with letters, the writers of vhich, without a single exception, declared it to be their conviction that Bacon, and not his wife, was the murderer. It seems that Bacon has acquired a most unenviable character at that place amiong all the inhabitants. In the first place, he acquired considerable notoriety by the seduction, under peculiar circumstances, of a respectable young womau, whom he subsequently deserted, and who affiiliated her child to him.
The next thing was the extremely suspicious death of his mother, and the public will learn with surprise that a circumstance so pregnant with suspicion should have been allowed to occur in so populous a town as Stamford without a proper judicial inquiry. From inquiries instituted in the early part of this week by Inspector Young while at Stamford, he discovered that in the first week of May, 1855, Bacon, then a locksmiith and general ironmonger there, sent his apprentice to the shop of the Messrs. Wright, chysisists, for an ounce of arsenic, and desired him to say that it was for the purpose of hardening iron. The arsenic, however, was refused, as he was not known at the shop and brought no written request for it. On returniing to his master he told him of this, when Bacon replied that it made no difference as he should get it himself. On the 8th of the month Bacon himself was served with an ounce of arsenic, which he said he wanted to poison rats, and on the Sunday following, the 13th, his mother dined with him. The first course-if it may be caUed so-was broth, and after taking a cup of it the old woman became exceedingly ill, complained of great pain in her stomach, accompanied by vomiting, and heat of throat, &c.; in fact, a the symptoms attendant on the administration of arsenic. She was taken home to her own house, and lingered in great pain until the Tuesday following, wheR she died. So strong were the suspicions at that time that the subject was canvassed among her friends on the day of the funeral, and the conclusion they came to was that any inquiry would not bring the old woman to life, but might bring her sou to the gallows. The next event was the scandal of his living in adultery with his servant, and that servant a convicted thief, while his wife was at St. Luke's madhouse; and the last, his apprebension and trial on a charge of arson in setting his house on fire. In this case the evidence was so strong that the jury felt bound to return a special verdict to the effect that the circumstances were extremely suspicious, yet they did not consider they warranted a conviction.

THE BISHOP OF EXETER.-We stated in The Times
THE BIsHOP or ExFm .I,-We stated in Thv Times
a few days ago that the Bishop of Exeter, having been appealed to by Archdeacon Moore Stevens, bad condemned the conduct of the Rev. R. Roper in placing a huge evergreen cross over the altar at St. Olave's church, Exeter, and other decorations in evergreens. Since then a long correspondence has taken place between the bishop, the archdeacon, and the Rev. R. Roper. The last complains to the archdeacon that he has been condemned by him and the bishop without having been informed of the charge, or allowed any opuortunity for explanation; to which the archdeacon replied that it was clear, from the rev. gentleman's correspondence with the churchlwardens, that he knew the charge made against him, and therefore had an opportunity of giving an explanation or complying with their wishes. Mr. Rtoper then informs the archdeacon that he did not know of the charge having been brought against him, and that be has had no opporhmity of explaining. From the archdeacon the rev. gentleman ap-
Is to the bishop, wild informs his Lordship that he has eaen in the habit of having the church decoratedformnany years; that it has not offended the devout congregation of St. Olave's; that none of the memorialists against the decorations are members of his congregation; and that one of them is " held in reputation as a fortune-teller, and usually denominated the White Witch." The rev. gentleman proceeds-

Yesterday Sir Colin Campbell, Inspector of Infantry, paid a visit to the camp at Colchester, for the purpose of inspecting the internal arrangements of the camp, and ascertaining the efficiency of the various depots forming the garrison. The troops at present quartered in that neighbourhood are formed into three battalions, cbmprising the depOts of 12 regiments, and numbering nearly 3,000 men. Thg first battalion, comprising the 2d, 4th, 12th, and 13th regiments, is under$he command of Lieutenant-Colonel Whitmore, Major Peel, and Captain Adjutant Bachanan. The second battalion includes the depots of the 6th, the 33d, the 45th, and 50th, and is under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Armstrong, Major Dowbiggen, and Captain Ward. The third battalion consists of the 73d, 77th, 8Gth, and 89th, under Lieutenant-Colonel Street, Major Maydwell, and Captain Thelwall, the whole being under the superintendence of Lieutenant-General Gascoigne, and an efficient staff of officers, including several Crimean heroes. Sir Colin Campbell, having spent considerable time in the inspection of the books of each battalion, proceeded to the examination of the accoutrements and kits of the men, who were called out in heavy marching order, and expressed his satisfaction at the clean and soldierly appearance of the men. The visit of this gallant officer is likely to extend over several days, during which the inspection will have Tegrd to everything tending to the comfort and health of the troops. The depots of several regiments thinned by the Crimean cam paign and by draughts for foreign service, are now being re. plenished by recruits, and before long will receive their full complement of men. The camp has undergone great improvement since the departare of the German Legion, and works are now in progress which indicate that the garrison will be permanent. Extensive additions have been made to the drill gronnds; a farm of 70 acres in extent, immediately contiguous to the camp, has been hired for rifle practice, and a body o' instructors in musketry has recently been appointed, so that Colchester will probably become one of tha most important infantry training schools in the kingdom. The general opinion is that daring the ensuing spring a; least 10,000 men, including the militia regiments, will occupy this camp.
One hundred and seventy eight non-commissioned officers and men were yesterday discharged at Chatham from the following regiments-viz. :-1st Royals, 2d Royals, 3d Bumfi (24 men), 5th Fusileers, 7th Royal Fusileers (15 m6n), 8th The Kings, 10th, 28th, 30th, 32d, 34th, 41st Welsh, 44th, 46th, 47th, 4Sth, 51st Light Infantry (46 men), 57th (10 men), 60th Rifles, 6Sth Light Infantry (9 men), 70th, 71st Highland light Infantry3 (17 men), 72d flighlanders (10 men), 83d and 02d Highland ers, with some men belong. ing to the Land Transport Corps.
The naval ship building at Pembroke dockyard is still rapidly proceeding, and there are now about 2,000 persons employed in the yard. Among the vessels on the stocks and under completion the fine screw frigate Doris is the mos' forward, and it is expected she will be ready for launching about April next. She is pierced for 32 guns, and is sister ship to the Diadem, launched some time since. The leviathan screw line-of-battle ship Howe is also in shape, andwill no doubt be ready to be removed from the stocks before the present year closes. The keel of a new screwship has lately been laid down, the length of which, from cutwater to stern, is 360 feet. This vessel when completed will be about 300 feet over all, and will be the longest in the English navy. The Windsor Castle, 116, sailing ship, still retains her old berth upon the stocks where she was built some eight years since. We understand it is in contemplation to convert her into a screw vessel as soon as the Melpomene, 50-gan frigate, undergoing a similar process, is completed. The Ioevenge, 60, now building, is in a forward state. The Doris is an exceedingly handsome vessel, and will be fitted with the heaviest guns in the English naval service. Several new storehouses are being erected within the dock walls, and many of the old ships have been lengthened several feet towards the sea. The graving dock is also undergo ing considerable extension.
The Simoom, 18, steam troopship, Commander Cooke, went out of Portsmouth harbour yesterday morning, and anchored at Spithead to take in powder, &c., before proceeding to embark troops.
The MIegsra, 6, steam troop-frigate, Commander Purvis, hauled over to moorings off Gosport yesterday morning to swing for the adjustment of her compasses; she has received her crew, and wil proceed to her rendezvous, to embark the troops before reported in a day or two.
The steamvessel Pigmy left Portsmouth yesterday after noon for the eastward with supernumeraries for the ships there.
The Sprightly and Comet steamvessels were reported to be going from Portsmouth to the scene of the wreck of the mail ship Tyne yesterday evening, to render assistance.
The Hamilla Mitchell hired freight ship went out of Portsmouth harbour yesterday and anchored at Spithead, to await further orders. She has 215 non-commissioned officers and men, Ul women, and 17 children, Major Bush in command; Captains Dixon, Maude, and Fraser; Lieutenants Smith, Dixon, and Baird; Ensign White, and Assistant-Surgeon Abbot-all for Trinidad. The William Hlammond will embark her troops this morning.
On the application of Colonel H. Sandham, commanding the Royal Engineers' establishment at Chatham, the authorities have accorded permission for the troops belonging to the Royal Engineers to continue their operations in destroying old Rochester-bridge.

The P field battery, Royal Artilery, under the command of Major Hoste, arrived at Norwich barracks on Wednesday, succeeding the D field battery, comm anded by Major Strange, and now destined for the camp at Aldershott.
In consequence of the frequent acts of robbery which hav i recently taken place at Woolwlch by ruffians in the uniform of soldiers of the Royal Artillery, Major-General Sir W. F. Williams, commandant of the garrison, issued an order to assemble the whole of the regiment on parade in front of head-quarters. The commandant, accompanied by his staff and a number of field officers on horseback, accordingly arrived on the ground at 10 o'clock yesterday morning, where the entire regiment of artilery had been previously drawn up, and formed three sides of a square, the battalions composing the centre rank in one continuons column. The Royal HorseArtillery, dismounted, occupled the right face, and the field battalions that of the left. The General first approached the batteries, and in an energetic and elaborate address informed them how much he regretted the disgraceful occurrences which had taken place, and for which reason he had called them together, ia order to express his indignation and disgust. One of the instances to which he would refer was committed on an officer of high sanding and deserved estimation in their own regiment. He assured theni he was fully certain that his disgust at these outrages was appreciated by the entire regi; ment, as the pride and honour of the British soldier was deeply wounded therein; and he felt confident that the majority of those present felt as much disgust as himself. Among so large a body of men he could not, naturaLly, depend on the integrity of every individuaL Their character, however, as a body, had been much lauded in his presence on various occasions, and from his own personal experience he believed from his heart they deserved every word of it. lie exhorted them to endeavour to check any evil habits which the better disposed might at any time perceive in any of their comrades, and made sundry remarks on the conduct of the men generally. The General after. 'wards advanced towards the Royal Horse Artillery and the field batteries, and addressed them separately in a similar manner, after which they defiled and returned to quarters.
Captain Pigou, of the Small Arms Brigade, Royal Artillery, stationed at Woolwich, is ordered to take over a field battery on the 10th proximo, and Captain Middleton, with his company, is ordered to rejoin the 13th battalion, and Captain Roomer, No. 2 of the 8th battalton, is ordered to take over the small arms anmunition brigade from Captain Pigou.

The Prevention Of Crime.
THE PREVENTION OF CRIME.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Having admitted my former two letters on the punishment of crime, perhaps yon wiU kindly stow me now to make some remarks upon its prevention, which is obviously the most important part of the whole subject.
I have, however, no grand specific to offer. If crime ii ever to be extensively and permanently diminished, it wiU be, I think, not by any one mode of repression, but by a combination of measures, such as shaU receive the fau sanction of society. One of tho faults of the age, as it appears to me, is reliance upon means of reformation left to struggle on in the midst of influences, allowed contemporaneon ly to exist, which are powerful and numerous enough to nentralize them if ttey were tenfold more and tenfold better than they are. The measures which I venture to propose seem to me at least to be feasible, little open to dispute, and therefore such as may lead to some good results.
1. Break up the haunts of thieves; they are known to the police, for the greater part, in town and country. You will thus destroy the power of combination and of previous arrangement of plansof robberyamongthieves, andtheopportunity for the partition and disposal of stolen property, and very materially injure their nefarious trade. So irn the streets known thieves should not be suffered to walk toge. ther. 'Whenever in company they are about mischief ; they are in wait for their prey. Thieves can do little as 'ndividuals. When found together, then let the leading one be made to give an account of himself, under the Vagrancy Act, to a magistrate, and if there be a boy in the gang let him be committed to a reformatory.
2. Suppress those schools of infamy and vice, the penny theatres, and such like places of resort, in all our large towns, where the children of the poorer classes are indoc. trinated in the lessons of Jack Sheppard and all the ancient and modern heroes in villany. From these forcing-houses vast numbers pass, if girls, into the pros'itution of the streets; if boys, half-trained already, into the hands of burglars and pickpockets, who are always on the look-out for clever javenile assistants.
3. Reform the publi^house trade, until it be left in the hands only of reputable persons, and in fair proportion to the reasonable wants of the population. Fully 50 per cent. of the crime of our country is chargeable, directly or indirectly, upon the publichouse, as at presant conducted, including pre-eminently the beershop.
4. Raise the character of your police, as one of the opposing forces to succesful villany. Give them more power of action, more pay, more encouragement, and a more befitting costume; establish in their ranks orders of merit and of good service; let them be a preventive as well as a detective force.
5. Let the laws be more stringently carried out in certain particulars (as I ventured in my first letter to suggest), and punishmentbe more certain. The great end of punishment is to deter from crime and to act upon the multitude ; therefore severity to the few is benevolence to the many, and the truest humanity. It is the mission, not of the law, but of Christianity, to save, to reform, to restore. Certainty in punishment, however, is of more importance than severity, and therefore men like Lord Campbell, who have shut up gaps in our laws through which clever rogues used to escape, are to be deemed great public benefactors. But there is no suaU room for improvement still in the law, when a learned judge has to lament, as in the gold robbery case lately, that he must let the most guilty of the three condemned men off with the lightest punishment.
S. Then let there be such consideration paid by the Legislature to the condition of the working classes, and our poorer brethren who are honest and virtuous, that it shall be possible for them to have such a thing as a home, and a dwelling-place for their families to grow up in without admixture and contamination with the most vicious and depraved. The condition of the dwellings of the poor (notwithstanding the labours of noble-minded men) in our lanes and alleys and courts, and in many also of our rural villages, Is still national disgrace, and a fruitful source of criminality. Here sanitary reform is moral reform.
In such an onslaught as this on crime and criminals tha weak poinlt is the national jealousy of encsoachment upon the liberty of the subject. The moral nuisance of the crovwed alley is to be left to propagate vice in its hotbeds because of the rights of property; the cover of the thief is not to be disturbed because it wil dislodge the disreputable publican, and entail injury upon vested interests. The robber is to be allowed to confederate with his class, and to train the hapless child for a life of infamy, because the law takes no cognizance of the intent until followed by the overt act; and the police are to have their hands tied, because they sometimes abuse their power and trench upon the liberty of the people. The answer to aU which is simply this-evil-doers of all sorts have by far too much liberty, and therefore well-doers have theirs abridged and their property violated. Honest men who have anything to lose (cantabit vacuus corarm latrone tiator) are obliged to go in company to be a match for the confederacies of robbers, and the houses of the respectable must be closed and barred, and the inmates armed, to meet the burglars, as if there were no law and no police.
I have said nothing about the positive agencies for good in the country. That is rather foreign to my professed purpose. I may, however, be permitted to add that if national education is to prove a great means of preventing crime in future, it must be directed more than it is at pre. sent to the cultivation of habits of thought and action in the young of both sexes calculated to make the future homes of the people happier-better rivals, in fact, to the tavern and beerhonse; and if religion is to indoctrinate with its blessed precepts extensively the masses of the population it must be far more aggressive, its teachings more intelligible and attractive to the less educated, and its sympathies more developed towards the virtuous poor. Happily there has been a great advance in all this of late years, but so has there been in the necessity.
I have the honour to be, Sir,
Your obedient servant.

Sir,-Thinking an account of an accident which haa oc. curred to the machinery of the Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamship Nubia would he interesting to the public, I embrace this opportunity of sending you the par. ticulars.
Having left Suez on our return passage to Calcutta with the English mails of the 4th of November, we proceeded, under favourable circumstances, towards the 9r6t coaling station, Aden, at which place we arrived on the morning of the 27th of November, all well. On the evening of the same day we steamed ahead for Point do Galle, everything being in good working order. The ship was ro esing rapidly towards the second coaling station, aud a are
weil up to 4 o'clock p.m. of the 1st of December:, t}en the after bearing of the crank-shaft gave indacathns of aundue amount of friction. The usual remedies t h ing applied andfound insuient to reduce the temperasure, water wvas subetitoted and kept playing wiithout inter. mission until 8 p.m., whEen on examination by Mr. Small the first engineer, fears were entertained of the shaft having broken. The engines were immediately stopped, the bearing examined, when to the dismay of all a fracture was quite visible, extending from point to point over more than half the circumference of the journal, or bearing. Seeing this, it was impracticable to proceed with both engines, or even with one, as the injury was at the after end of the shaft; it was therefore thought necessary to return to Aden under sail, or beat a passage to Point de G-.lle, either of which, having about 130 passengers on board, would have been attended with unpleasant results. During a consaltation batween the captain and some of the principal passengers as to what should be done it was proposed to the first engineer by the third engineer, a Mr. Williams, to lift the shaft and reverse it, which, with little trouble, would enable them to work the after engine. The idea was immediately coincided with, and communicated to the captain. Measures were at once commenced for carrying out the proposition, which was safely accomplisbed at the expiration of 40 hours, when the ship wS again nuder steam. Wearrived at PointdeGaloon the 5th of December and at MIadra on the Ilth of Deoember, the ship being propelled with one engine at about the speed of nine knots. Great praise is-due to theengineers for the coolness presented ad the exertion made during the re arrangement of the machinery, also to the captain and officers fortheirvaluablo assistance, but especially tothethird engineer for theproposition; and it is to be hoped the com-
any wil not furget to reward merit by promotion. The passengers, one and all, passed a vote of thauks to the. engineers, through whose ability and attention they were enabled to proceed to their various destinations

He said, -I little anticipated when I did myself the honour to accept the invitation of the committee of the Bristol Athena3ura to attend this soirile that I should find in it anx occasion when I should be called upon to mak-e mny first address to a meeting of imy fellow-country. men. (Cheers.) As, however, I have been requested to address you, Ido eo,trusting to your kind indulgence for a few minutes while I enaeavour to expla-in the causes which in my humble estimation tend to create a peculiar interest with your fellow countrymen who, like myself, follow the profession of arms in mnstitutions such as the Bristol Atlienseum, which are established for the purpose of educating the public mind and diffusing general information throughout the length and breadth of the land. (Cheers.) If history be consulted for the purpose of comparing the feelings of the people of this country with respect to the army in former times with their feelings as to the army of the present day, it will be seen that a wonderful change hars comne over the mninds of Englishmen. (Hear, hear.) Formerly a standing armnywas lookeodupon--and rightly so-with amost jealous eye, and as an institution whichmight be abused to the infringement of the liberkties of the country; aLnd it was with difficuaty that E~glishmen could be brought to tolerate such an institution. Tanka, howev-er, to the general diffusion of information and ~eater enlightenment of the population, through whichf the Governmnent and institutions of this country have become more liberal, safeguards have been raised up which allow of a mUiitary forceo being maintained, without creating among the most timid of our fellow-countrymen, o'r even women, the slightest fear that their freedom or liberties aire in any degree endangered. (Cheers.) Altliough the H[ouse of Commons, as expononts of the puLblic rmid, still continue to vote the sup p lies upon which the existence of the army depends only frem year to year, and to pass the Mu tiny Act and lawvs which govern it at the beginning of each April,s that an omission on their parts would place the

(Cheers.) In spite of the preachments of the Peace Society, until that hampy periodl in the world's histo arrives when -wars shal cease andI the lien lie ZoWn with the lamb, and believiv' that this
od ifa distant, we do not live Yn dread of ~ingplacd inthefoolish predlicament to which I haveallded.(Chersand laughter.) This feeling of securit onou patsis heresult of the general diffusion of infomaton; nd ew lt m point out the very marked result whch avetakn pacefrom this same cause within the memory of manyintsro . At the commencement of that glorious struggle in the Peninsula, when the British army rose like a phoenix from its ashes, what wore the objects to be achieved, and what were the means placed in the hands of that great and wonderful warrior, the Duke of Wellington, with which to achieve these objects ? 280,000 men, in great part tried and victorious warriors, in almost total occupation of the Peninsrula-warriors accustomed to victory, who with the swelling tide of war had submerged almost the entire continent of Europe-these were his opisonents. The object of En lad was to roll back the tid& of conquest, and to clip t lewings of the invading eagle.
But mark tho means placed at the disposal of that great
man, who at the time he undertook his task was derisivelyI rken of as the " Sepoy GeneraL" 80,000 British soldiers,
'uappointed, deficient in clothing, badly equipped, no siege
train, uomilitaryartificersorsappers, nocom~missariatandanI emt hst~ aded by raw native levies in a ten-times worseI con~dition than .1themselves,-such were the means placed at his dis"sa, and even after these beroes, under the guidanee of their able chief, had forceod the passage of the Deoue, and after some 20,000 of thema had during two dlays min-m'
tained their ground at Talavora aintmre than double' their numbers, with a loss of 4,00 in killed and wounded, and hadl thus establishedl their own reputation and that of
their chief, and taught their courageous foes of what stuff! they were made, the Duke of Wellington had to lamnent their being shoeless, in rage, and without pay, while the city of London recorded on a petition its discontent with the "1rashness, ostentation, and useless valour" of the commaLnder who, having lauded in Portugal, was destined to lead his army through Spain into France, and only to revisit his native landI by the route of Calais and Dover, after witnessin' the downfall of Paris. (Hear, hea.) The state of that ino%le army was not so much to be attributed to the Government as to t'he condition of this country. The armiy was unpopular, the war was unpo-pular, and therefore credit was neot high. The bale was resorted to, and the Ministers of the Crown would scarcely find mneans in men or money to carry on the war. How different was this state of things from that during the war just terminted ! (Rlear, hear.) This Russmia war was the war of the peoplo (cbeers , who willingly increased their taxationfoit support, an, not content with the supply by Goverznment of the means necessary to provide for the wants of their army, came forward, men, women, and children, of all classes, from the peer to the peasant, all headed by our gracious Sovereign and her Royal children,
to supply comfort-s and even luxurxies to the moen they hLad
sent to meet-not the enemy of a dyasasty er a class, but the dishonest pluniderer of his neighbour (cheers), the enem of civilization, and therefore the enemy of the people of thi
free country. (Cheers.) Then also was sen that beautiful and sympathizn charity of our countrywomnen (cheers) which was persoifed,M in Mise htingale and those kind ladfies who followed her to icothe3y their attentlons those who were honoured by suffering, andl many of them by dying' for their much loved Queen and country. (Renewed cheers.) And now let me ask to what may we attribute this wonderfulI scene? Clearly so the increased enlightenment of the public mind, which, always craving for information, received it both previous to siad during the past war from the Government and from the pres with such rapidity that they were enabled to form aLn opinion as to its justice, t-o keep up their interest in it during its progress, and in the face of difficulties, sometimnes almost disheartening, were encouraged and emboldened togpush it to a successful issue, (Applause,) Such are some of* e results which my brethren in arms as well as myself see in the diffusion of knowledge among 'our fellow-countrymen (cheers)-resalts which comfort the soldier and encourage him in the performance of his duties, and which lead us to wish success to all institutions which, like the Bristol Atheseumn, are calculatedl to edlucate and enlgtn h publio mindl. (Loud cheers) We also see other rslswtin our ranks, in the higher education of members of our profession and the consequent improved behaviour of our soldiers and diminution of punish. menit, until at last those horrid scenes of corporal suiffering which uLsed to harrow the public mind have abnost becoine matters of history. ("Hear" and cheers.) We have als
got rid of the ballot and forcible enlistments, and can justly pride ourselves en being the only volunteer standing army in the world (hear, hear)-a boast which is of some value if estimated by the old saying which makes one volunteer equivalent to three pressed men. (Hear, hear.) These are some of the effects of institutions like tbe Bristol Athenaeum so far as they' relate to the arm7, May these effects be increased by iLmprovements in administration and a greater adpaiiyof our officers, soldiers, and militaryestablish.

But there are other effecta to which, from the position inwhich I served during the late war, I may bo excused for adverting, having had especial opportunities of observing them. I allude to the effect produced upon the mnds oi foreigners by the unity of acton displayed by the British nation during the late struggle ("Hear," and ¢hoers.I As a consequence of this union, as the difficuhltes of the army increased the armies of England increased also, and whereas at the beginning of the war England, afterdrainingevery availablesource, could scarcely send 30,000 mnen to maeet her enemaies, as the end of two short years, not only had she aupplied her IOSes, but had actually, I believe, upwards of 80,000 men under arms, on or near the seat of war, backed by a large army of reserve and by almost the only solvent exchequer in Europe. (Hear, hear.) I saw the effects of this great fact upon distinguished members of each of the armies of our allies; and I believe that each and, aU looked to the unanimity and trested more in the public opinion of England to bring the war to a successful and happy issue than they even trusted in their own Governments, (Hear bear.)

THE LrVERPPor FI2VA2&ZAL ASCIATION.
TO TEE EDITOR OF TRY TIMES.
Sir,-I have read carefully, and witle tbe most anxiouss desire to give to the subject an impartial or, I may say, a friendly consideration, the address of tke President of the Liverpool Financial Reform Association to the middle, commercial, manufacturing, and industrial classes of the unitedl kingdom, which appeared in your paper of yesterday. In the ranks of the first and last of these classes I have taken my part in the battle of life, and I have borne may share or the burdens they undergo. I may also claim no small interest inthe doings and sufferings of theother two. Itoccurs to me, not with the view of putting myself forward as the, representative of those great interests to which Mr. Robertson. Gladstone addresses himself, but simply for the purpose of drawing forth information whick may be of use in a question of such vitalimportance as that of the revision of taxation, to addreos to you a few remarks and inquiries which I hope 3r. Gladstone will do me and the public the favour to consider and answer.
I wiiU first say that we aU are under obligation to any body of our feUow-countrymen who devote their time and talents to the laying before us statements of our resource3 and burdens, and who try to devise such a method of apporlioning and collecting the revenue as may faUll with the teast possible weight on those whose labour and skill ana knowledge build up and sustain our national wealth and greatnss. The Liverpool Association and all similar bodies, eventhe crudest and most seemingly impractical amono them, have my best wishes. Not only are they monument8 which successive generations of Englshmen raise and perpetuate in honour of the freedom of opinion which creates them, but they each and all do good by awaking and keeping alive that attention to our resources and expenditure without which neither individual nor commun,ity can hope to prosper, as I trust and pray England may long prosper and advance
That it is most desirable to relieve the industry and trade of the countrv from all imposts which weigh hardly on the hbourer or shackle the enterprise of the merchant is a proposition to which I wUilingly agree. If by levying a reasonable percentage on the property of the country I could see my way towards achieving the great results of freeing the labourer from paying more than his fair share towards the annual revenue, and of making England the great warehouse and factor of the world, I should, for one, be only too glad to pay my first quarter's taxes in advance, and sleep, in the happy consciousness that no one was unjustly burdened for my advantage. But the questions I desire to submit to Mr. Gladstone's consideration are these-
How will he define the nature of the thing caUed real property, with a view to its assessment; and when and hovr often in each year wiU he assess it ? On a particular daysay, for example, the 24th of December-there hangs in the larder of most of the classes to whom he has addressed himself a piece of beef, a turkey, most probably, and sundry other supplies for the great festival in which we all delight. If that day be chosen for the perquisition, are the joints; and turkey, and canvass -backed ducks, which years of work of some kind or another enable the merchant or manufacturer to count on for the Christmas dinner, or is the more homely fare of the labourer to be taken as so much real property for the nonce; and are the butcher, the poulterer, and all the other garnishers of the feast to be exempt, because their tenure has been transitory, but profitable while that of the others is transitory and unprofitable ?
Again,-Is the man who can afford to invest,-say, a 1,O000. in a picture, or a statue, or any other work of art, to the increasing taste for wlhich unproductive invectments tha numbers of new shops which are opened in every quarter of London bear witness, to be muleted of a yearly tribute, with the additional pleasure of a house to house visitation, and are the picture dealer andthe curiosity sellerto go free?
Those great and valuable libraries which in many heuses even of the middle-classes have been accumulated and preserved with jealous care and pains,-are they to be taxed ? and are trade coUections to escape ?
On the one hand, in addition to loss of interest, we shall have to pay a penalty for the possession of whatever is beautiful and instructivein ourhouses. On the other hand, where would be the freedom of trade, to encourage which we are asked to overturn our present system.
I mightgo through the whole circle of ourdomestic possessions, from the India shawls of our wives to the Cochin China screanmers of our daughters, and ask similar and, to, my mind, equally unanswerable questions. But in sober seriousness I put this to Mr. Gladstone,-How does he propose to ascertain the present marketable value, on any day, in any given year, of the whole real property of England, and, having ascertained that, how does he propose to levy his direct tax thereon for two years in succession? What I desire, and what I think we have aright to expect from reformers of our present system is, not the announcement of a theory-which we should be only too pleased to see reduced to practice-but a plain detailed statement of the whole burdens which we may naturally expect to be caUed on to bear in years of ordinary pressure, and of the means proposed to meet our engagements. There is no reason wvhy any man in this country who can furnish such a statement, based on authentic documents which are open to us all, and who can demonstrate its feasibility, should not arrive at the high position of Chancelor of the Exchequer; and great as is my admiration for Mr. Robertson Gladstone's namesake, I should hail the advent of the statesman who would place within our reach as realitiee even a few of the good things with which the Liverpool Association periodically tantalizes our imaginations. Instead of such a statement as I yearn for, and as I hoped in taking up your paper I had at last got hold of, I found nothing but vague estimates of our resources and shadowy schemes for their yearly assessment 'nd coUection.
Without entering into details, while details are so carefully avoided by the Association, I may just observe that some of the taxes which it is said we ought to roduce are of such a nature that they do not weigh heavily on the public, except the public choose to make themselves liable to their exaction. The taxes on spirits and tobacco, in my opinion, are of this kind. I am far from desiring that the labourer and the mechanic should not have in grog ant pipes his equivalents for the claret and cigars of his wealthy neighbounrs, but who could hesitate between levying a direct impost of 2s. out of the workman's weekly pound, and the continnance of the present taxes on spirits and tobacoo, the burden of wvbich is limited by the prudence of those whot contribute to them ? The taxes on butter, cheese, coffee, corn, currants, figs, pepper, raisins, rica, sugar, and tea. we should all desire to see reduced or extinguished, but we must be told how to raise the money which is to replace them. I have lately protested against the continuance of the income-tax in its present form, against its undue pressure on the skiU and Inteligence of the country. It is a tax which we can see our way to deal with, and Parliament can provide the means for its extinction at a given period. Whatever may be the inquisitorial and vexatious proceedings inherent to that tax, the proposal to tax the whole real property of the country, so far as we can conjecture from the scanty programme which has boen submitted to us, would, if attempted to be carried out, lead to such vexatious and detestable invasions of our household privacy as to fix upon its advocates the universal execration of the countryIf I am mistaken in so believing I must await the full explanation to which I think we are entitled as to the means of collecting the tax. Mr. Gladstono indicates, &a he says, the principle on which a just system of direct taxation may be founded, and leaves it to the rulers and representatives of the nation to work it out. That anything sbould be called a system which its promoters declineto put before us in a systematized form is simply an abuse of terms, and that it should be called a just system while we are left in the dark as to its working is what I, for one, protest against. I know that I am asking for a gret deal from the Association, for the results of long and csreful inquiry, calling for much thought and research; but they have undertaken to instruct us, and to make direct taxation feasible, and I only ask for full informatioa In the interest of the cause they have combined to promote. It is because I feel that no impression wil be made on the country, and that the Association will fail to obtain a beaing till it condescends to details, that I have venturet1
to address y en on this subject. I have asked, as I have aid, for a great deal; but the Liverpool Association hm beenlongin existence, and direct taxation has been its favourite doctrine. It is possibly in possio n of m uch information which it has not hithelto deemed it necessary to ubish. For the present, h owever, we must await A
plate account of the plan proposed to be substituted for our present one. When such a statement is laid before us no one will be mere ready then I to weigh and consider it in
ill its bearings, and to lend all possible aid to the establish. ment of the best and most equitable system which can ba devised. I am. Sir vour obedient servant.

tThe foUowing appearad in our second edition of yo3terdaY :-1
PARIS, WEDNESDAY, JAN. 21, 6 P.m.
Cardinal Melrlot, Arobbishop of Tours, will, in aU probability, bh) the new Archbishop of Paris. He refused the appointment twice, preferring by far remaining at Tours, where he is much liked, and it was only at the earnest request of the Emperor as a personal favour that he consented. The choice seenis to be generally approved, except perhaps by the Ul Itramontane party. The Cardinal is described as tolerant in religious opinions, and otherwise liberal. He is highly spoken of, and in every respect the Emperor's choice of him for this difficult, and, after such examples as we have had, dangerous post, is unexceptionable.
The petition which Verger has addressed to the Emperor fills four pages, and displays some literary ability, but is humble and supphiant in tone. It, however, shows that the petitioner considers himself different from the rest of mankind, and believes in his own infallibility. He declares in the course of it that Christianity requires regeneration, and that the inferior clergy ought to be enfranchised from the yoke of the higher. He declares too that he looks on himself as the Peter the Hermit of a new crusade; and that, being determined to announce his mission by a coup d'etat, he had selected for his victim the highest dignitary of the Church. He, however, adds that his condemnation to death has not surprised him, as a great judicial manifestation was required for so illustrious a death, but that that bare manifestation is sufficient satisfaction to social order, and that to go beyond it would be unjust and impolitic. He therefore prays that, instead of being put to death, he may be subjected to a noble and honourable exile ! He received the chaplain of the Roquette prison yesterday and to-day, and conversed for some time with him. Though he still wears the strait-waistcoat as a precautionary means against any attempt at self-destruction, yet every facility is given to him to write whenever he feels so disposed. He writes a great deal, and among other books which he wanted he asked to-day for a Latin Bible, which was immediately given to him. Notwithstanding his calmness he gets animated, and even excited, when the conversation is prolonged. His constant thought and favourite topic of conversation is the result of his appeal to the Court of Cassation, which will probably be decided to-morrow.
When the officer arrived at the prison of the Conciergerie to transfer the convict to the Roquette, Verger, in tears, took leave of all the keepers. He wished, he said, to embrace them all for their attention to him. He had advanced towards the door, when he returned again to the table, and asked that the four quires of paper which he had written during his imprisonment might be placed in his bands. "It is mine," said he; "it is my property; I am at liberty to bequeath it to whom I please. I will bequeath it to my brother Frederic. Some day or other it will be worth more thanl,OOO,OOOf." One of the registrar's clerks, who had written for him under his dictation since his conviction, and to whom he expressed his gratitude and his regret that he had nothing to offer him, asked him for an autograph. Verger took advantage of a moment when his hands were free to allow him to sign an official paper, and wrote the following:-
" I have several times seen Ml. R-, who has had the extreme kindness to visit me in my prison.
" I thank him for it, as well as for the amiable and con. solatory words he has addressed me.
" God never forgets a good action, however trifling it may be, and He regards that which is done for the least of His servants as a favour to Himself.
- L. VERGER,
"' Vinctus pro Xto (pro Christo) "Conciergerie, 1Sth January, 1857."
After having taken leave of the keepers Verger was preparing to leave, but at that moment he manifested intense anxiety. He believed they were concealing the truth, and he repeatedly asked whether his removal from the Conciergerie had not some other motive than a change of prison. On being answered that it had not he took courage, but when he was ascending the van, and saw a crowd in the court, he cried, " They ale deceiving me; it is certain that I am being removed for the purpose of executing me! Oh yes! I have no doubt now but I am about to be executed." " No," replied the officer, " you are, as you were already told, to be taken to the prison of La Roquette." This reply did not appear to satisfy him; he was ghastly pale, and it was witli some difficulty he could mount into the van, where he was placed with an officer in the fore part. The other compartments were occupied by other convicts destined for the same prison. As soon as Verger was seated the postilion drove off towards La Roquette. During the entire drive Verger was preoccupied with the idea that he was being led to execution, and incessantly demanded that the officer should assure him in a solemnn manner that it was not so. " Swear to me before God," said Verger, " that you are not taking, me to the guillotine-that I am not about to be executed." He was answered with the same affirmations, but he still thought those answers were dictated by humanity, for he added, " Do not fear to afflict me, for the certainty of my end would cause me less pain than to be in doubt." It was with this feeling that he arrived in the courtyard of La Roquette at a quarter to 5 o'clock. Having quitted the van, Verger cast a rapid look round him, and, finding that what the officer said was true, he apologized for his incredulity, and again took courage. He was then placed in one of the three cells allotted to convicts under sentence of death. It was last occupied by the assassin Dombey, and previously by a convict, who, on hearing that his sentence was commuted, was attacked with congestion of the brain, and died a few days after. On entering the cell Verger examined it carefully and appeared in some degree to recover his self-possession. He anxiously demanded whether he might procure the same food he was accustomed to at the Conciergerie, and he again solicited the favour, which could not be granted, of being freed from the strait-waistcoat. " Please to request the Prefect of Police to grant me that favour," added he; " be assutred that I have no intention either to escape or to kill myself. Moreover, am I not so well guarded that such an attempt would be impossible ? If it were known what a tortiure it is to a man like me, to whom continual labour is a necessity, I am cer. tain that he would dispense with it. See my position. I am sentenced to death. In a few days, perhaps, the sentence will be executed; but previous to that I have some preparations to make. I wish to make my will, to regulate the interests of my heirs, &c., and I cannot do so, because it is impossible for me to write." He was given to understancd that the regulations in that respect were imperative, but that his request should be forwarded to the proper quarter, and this promise appeared to satisfy him. However that maybe, the dejection -which has come overhim since his conviction is far from being dispelled, although he slept more tranqul-ly on Monday night, but again yesterday he became much agitated, and the preservation of his life appears to occupy all his thoughts.
The following telegraphic despatch has been received:
BERLIN, JsAy. 20.
"The President of the Council has announced to the Diet, that the Neuch;ttel prisoners having been set unconditonally at liberty, the question of war is at an end, and that there is every reason to hope an amicable arrangement will be effected by a Conference at which all the great Powers are to be represented."
A private letter from Madrid, dated the 16th inst., says:-
" General Narvaez is on the eve of a great battle. Under a constitutional system political battles are fought in Parliament, openly aud before the eyes of the public. Under a reivime like tho present in Spain these battles are fought in the palace, in the ante-chambers of the Queen or King, and the elements of war are the intrigues of courtiers or of the politicdl personages who have the Lntr-e there. By way of premonitory symptom the Court does not fail to show its ill-humour on every favourable occasion to General Narvaez, wlho has hitherto seemed indifferent about it. A few days since Narvsez appeared at the Opera in the box set apart for the Ministers, accompanied by a lady of much beauty, and supposed to be a relation of his. It was intimated to him that the Court saw with displeasure that this lady occupied the place which belonged to the other Ministers, who were consequently obliged to content themselves with the back seats of the box. General Narvaez endeavoured to exculpate himself, but three nights ago he appeared vith the same lady, and occupied the same post. When the Queen entered her box Narvaez went as usual to pay his respects, but Her Majesty turned her back upon him,
and did not even return his salute. Bat, what was ' the un. kindest cat of all," Her Majesty turned her eyes to the box wLere General O'DonneU was sitting, and was pleased to
salute him in the most graceful, gracious, and affectioaate manner. Narvaez looked black as thunder. You may judge how the audionce was amused at these exhibitions. Do not accuse us of iMlnature: the mutual jealousies, hatreds. and fears of those who alternately oppress and ruin the country are but poor satisfaction for us-but it is all we have. These slights, added to the manceuvres of the Abso. lutists, which are every day mnore menacing, convince
Narvaez that a storm is coming of which the issue ii doubtfuL If he come out of it successfully he will very probably strengthen his Government with a few of the constitutional Moderados, who on their side are also at work. In the meantime the anxiety is great in Madrid. We hear dark rumours of approaching troubles, and it is known that some superior officers have informed the authorities of the agitation and dissatisfaction said to appear among sowe of the troops. The precautions adopted in consequence have only tended to increase the agitation of the city,"

BERI;N, Jxi. 20.
Now that the Swiss Federal Assembly and Government have resolved to comply with the Prussian demand for an unconditional liberation of the piisoners, and the quashing of the proceedings against them, as a preliminary to al negootiation for the cessionl of the sovereignty of Neuchttel, you are doubtless anxious to hear from me what Prussia has done, is doing, or wil do further in the matter. This G;overnment has, I learn, lost no time in informing its representatives abroad, wy a circular despatch, of its wfillingness, now that its preliminary st-ipulation has been fulfilled, to enter into negotiations for the settlement of the sovereignty question. The despatch, I am told, is dated the 17th inst., and was sent off the same day. Now, as it was only the day before that the Swiss Council of State had adopted the resolutiontoliberatethe prisoners, which the National Council had adopted the daypreviously, it must be admitted that the folks here have certainly not been slow this time in committing their ntentions to paper, and bringing them to the knowledge of foreign Governments; doubtless, they have been very anxious to remove the false impression prevalent in Switzerland, and communicated through the Swiss press to other} countries, that the King of Prussia was atil desirous of vindicating his claims at the point of the sword, when reaUy the fact is, lie is perfectly willing and ready, and only too glad, to be able to abandon all preparations and plans for military action against Switzerland. I do not learn that this circular despatch of the 17th inst. puts forward any distinct proposals as to what form this Government contemplates the negotiations taking, whether direct with Switzerland, or through the intervention of some one State, or by a Conference of all the great Powers of Europe, with the addition of Switzerland, as the party mainly interested. As regards the probability of either of these courses, it would appear to be most in favour of a Conference. The Swrss have, it is true, put forward the desire, in more than one instance, to conduct their negotiations with Prussia alone, and, with reference to this, Carlsruhe has been mentioned as a convenient spot for delegates or envoys from both Governments to meet and treat; to this desire for separate negotiations they are led, as it would seem, by an apprehension lest the European Powers, once met for the settlement of the single point of the Neuchatel sovereignty, might embrace the opportunity to make some inconvenient alterations in the present Swiss Federal Constitution, which has as yet never been formaUy recognized by any foreign Power, and is obnoxious to the feelings of several of them.
The next mentioned method of going to work, viz., that the conduct of the negotiations should be given to one single State, which on this occasion could be no other than France, would be more unwelcome here than in Switzerland, for the pleasure lately expressed at finding the Emperor Louis Napoleon not taking the part of Switzerland against Prussia has been thoroughly outweighed here by the vexation felt at the tone of condescending patronage expressed towards Prussia in the Monit eur, and the numerous false statements, as regards the relative position of the Emperor and the King, that have been permitted to appear in the French press. The plan of a Conference, therefore, seems the most probable to unite aU suffrages, the more so as the cession of the sovereignty of Neuehatel, which is the object proposed, wil affect the provisions of the treaties of Vienna in 1815, and its recognition as vesting in the King of Prussia has already formed the subject of a Conference atLondon in 1852, and of a resolution of the German Federal Diet towards the close of last year. As regards the w.Nhen and the where this very probable Conference shall be held, I have gathered no indications, however slight ; but, as T have stated in a former letter, the place wil certainly not be Vienua, for Prussia is too exasperated at the very Austrian conduct that Cabinet observed towards her in the late complication ; against the venne being laid in Paris England would doubtless protest ; and there remains only London as a probable place, the precedent of the former protocol having been drawn up there speaking volumes in its favour.
Long as my yesterday's account of the Ordensfest was, I have still a few particulars to add before I dismiss the subject. On investing the four noblemen mentioned yesterday with the Order of the Black Eagle the King addressed very appropriate and for the most part flattering words to each of them. For instance, to Baron Manteuffel he expressed the satisfaction he had in conferring on him that testimonial for his long and unwearied services, however his modesty might have led him to underrate them, and to look upon this distinction as one beyond his elaims. He conferred on him this unusual token of distinction the more gladly as he was aware he had been exposed personally to a great amount of contumely and opprobrium in the faithful exercise of his office, &c. In the statates of the Order of MIerit it is provided that any holder of it for the space of 50 years shall have it reconferred on him at the end of that period, with an additional distinction of a crown added to the other insignia; this additional distinction feU on this occasion to the lot of three officers, Field-Marshal von Wrangel, General Count Groben, and Colonel von 13ulow; the latter has retired from active service; the two
former, however, occupy the two most prominent posts in the Prussian army, after having distinguished themselves in it 50 years ago. In speak. ing of the amount of emulation that these bits of riband and these crosses and stars succeed in producing throughout the officers in the Royal service, I omitted to mention, that they afford at the same time an additional security to the Government for the good conduct of the holders of them, inasmuch as the surrender of these highly-prized distinctions forms a subsidiary penalty attached to a number of slight offences.

A letter from Florence, of the 12th inst., states that the speech delivered at the opening, of the Chambers at Turin by King Victor Emmanuel had produced a most agreeable impression. There was but one voice of admiration throughout the city for the dignified, noble, and national langua eKing. The Emperor of Austria Idat Florence. The Grand Duke, it is | said, much desires the Imperial visit, but at the
Vecchio niatters are not regarded in the same point of view, and it is thought that this visit may cause some embarrassment, and greatly irritate the population. Lord John Russell, who has many friends at Florence, was about to leave for England,
The Municipal Council of Turin, at its sitting of the 15th inst., unanimously adopted the followlng orde. of the day;:-" The Municipal Council and its
administrators accept with gratitude the offering o! the Milanese citizens, and declare that they will carefullypreserve that offering as a monument of national honour, as the symbol of a common cause, and as a pledge of better times."'
A letter from Palermo of the 10th inst. announces numerous executions throughout Sicily for political causes. At Catanea, Louis Pellegcino, a youLng man, but a distinguished chymist, was shot a few days previously. Several students had been arrested. The troops mount guard during the dav with loaded muskets. The streets are deserted; and many of the shops closed. At Messina the arrests are not less numerous than at Catanea. Among the persons imprisoned are MI. Ribera and Villari, both directors of the literary journals the Caduteo and the Tremolotto. Dr. Guarneri, of Cefalii, had been sentenced to death by conrt-martial at Palermo. Every person entering or quitting the town is searched for letters or manuscripts. Many of the inhabitants have retired to the country to avoid the persecution of the police authorities.

At Gibraltar.-Her Majesty's steamer Curlew, and ths sorew steamers Lebanon and Taurus.
Our advices from Gibraltar are to the 16th inst. TI e Duke and Dachess d'Aumale, the Princess de Salerno, and the young Prince de Condc, with their suite, embarked on board the St. Andrew steamship on the afternoon of the 7th, and left for Palermo, where their Royal Highnessss intended to stay for a short time. Exchanges were quo'e I on the 10th as follows :-London, 90 days' date, 504 to 50.1; Paris, ditto, 5f. 32c.; MarseiUes, ditto, 5f. 33c.; Genoa, ditto, 5f. 34c.; Madrid, eight days' sight, I dis.; Cadiz, ditto, J dis.
On the morning of the 10th, nine miles to the eastward of the Rock of Gibraltar, the French bark Comate was run into by the White Falcon, an American ship of about 2,000 tons burden, and her masts had to be cut away, owing to the danger of going to the bottom when in coUision. Her Majesty's steamtug Bustler was sent to the assistance of the disabled vessel by the senior naval officer of the station. and took the bark and crew safely into port the same evening.
The British schooner Marina and the Portuguese brigantine Africano, driven on shore during the gale of the 26th of December, had been got afloat.
A stronggale, veering from west to north-west, set in a9 Gibraltar on the afternoon of the 12th. During the night and following morning it blew hard, with occasional showers and heavy squalls, which abated considerably to. wards the evening of the 13th, and during the night subsided altogether, the wind having shifted to the northward. The following casualties among the shipping in the bay are reported:-
The French bark Alexandre, of Marseilles, Captain Olivier, parted from her anchors and went on shore under the Orange Bastion. Her foremast went over the side, and she was full of water. The master and crew abandoned the vessel, which it was feared would become a total wreck.
Tho British brigantine Nazarene, Captain Priaulx, from New York, with a cargo of flour, dragged her anchors and grounded off the Old Mole Head on a sandy bottom, but was expected to be hauled into deep water as soon as part of her cargo was taken out.
The French brig Eliza Marie, Captain Jequel, with a cargo of wine and oil, from Cette for Brest, parted successively two of her chains and a couple of cables, but the exertions of the captain and crew succeeded in beaching her on the North Front, instead of running ashore on the rocks off the Devdl's Tongue, where it was at first feared she would have stranded.
The Spanish schooner Concha dragged her anchors, and fouled a French schooner, without, however, inflicting much damage.
The British bark Alpha, from Bristol, Captain Tulloch, laden with coals, from Cardiff for Gibraltar, was driven behind the Rock by the violence of the gale, with loss of the greater part of her sails, and making a great deal of water. Her Majesty's steamtug Bustler was promptly despatched to the Alpha's assistance, and towed her safely into the Bay.
The schooner Star of the West, of Plymouth, lost a chain and an anchor.
The American ship Sea Queen lost an anchor and par' of a chain, and broke the windlass, but rode out the gale with one anchor and 100 fathoms of chain.

LIVERPOOI, JAN. 22.
The Brag-bnza steamer brings Lisbon dates of the 15th inst., when the following veseels of war were in the Tagus :-Her MIajesty's ships Duke of Wellington, Rear-Admiral Sir R. S. Dsindas; Cesiar, Captain J. Robb; Sanspareil, Captain Astley C. Key; Exmouth, Captain Harry Eyres; Colossu;, Captain T. Thompson; and the James Watt, Captain T. V. Anson, which had arrived on the 12th from Plymouth.
The French ship Austerlitz andikamer Ph6nix, and the Dateb frigate Prins Alexander, had left on the 14th for Madeira, as also the Austrian screw frigate Conte Radetzky, and Sweedish corvette Clapman, for the south.
The Peninsilar and Oriental packet Alhambra, with the outward mails of the 7th, only arrived at Lisbon on the 14th at nightfall. She was obliged to put out to sea in consequence of a thick fog off Vigo, and a most terrific gale, which blew on the 11th, and lasted nearly 48 hours, forced her to proceed to Lisbon without touching at V'go and Oporto. It was feared this stormy weather had caused many disasters to shipping, and already telegraphic news had been received that the steamer Queen, D. Micklereid, which left Lisbon on the 10th, had run on shore two miles south of Vianna on the 12th, and at 4 a.m. nine of the crew were lost, but part of the cargo was likely to be saved.
Upon receipt of Admiralty deepatches per Alhambra, Rear-Admiral Dundas signalled the squa. dron in she Tagus to prepare for sea next day (the 16th), without waiting for the Shannon and Princess Royal, which were expected to join the Admiral during his cruise. As the Eragauna left Lisbon the Cintra, belonging to the same Liverpool line, was going up the Tagus.
The Falkland Islands.
THB FALKLAND ISLAYDS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIME.
Sir,-My attention has been called, by one of your leading articles of this day, to a letterby Mr. Eddy, advocating the Falkland Islands as the most eligible situation for a convict settlement.
Having resided there seven years and a-half as Governor, may be permitted to explain many of the erroneous assumptions of Mr. Eddy, which his imperfect knowledge of their climate, soil, &c., have led him into. First, I admit that as to the question of economy of transport the Falk. land Islands have the advantage over the Austra3ias and Vancouver's Island-not as compared, however, with Hudson's Bay.
The pensioners, or military settlers, alluded to by Mr. Eddy, were sent to the Falldands during my administration, in 1849. The expedition consisted of a captain and 30 noncommissioned officers and privates. I was instructed to make over to each man 25 acres of land, on which wooden cottages, brought from England with them, were to be erected at the expense of the colonial Government. Rations fuel, and a right to employment on public works were also secured to them for the first and part of the second years; and a right of commonage, in addition to their land, of 100 acres was allowed to each man.
On their arrival great discontent was manifested among them, participated in by their officer, and I had much difficulty in inducing them to suspend their judgments as to the entire impracticability of both soll and climate to grow anything besides the natural erasses of the country; and it was not until they saw, some months afterwards, a crop of very tolerable potatoes dug in the Government garden that I could persuade any of them to commence cultivating plots of their own. Notwithstanding that thers were a few of these men indefatigable in their attempts to raise produce of various kinds, not one of them has ever succeeded in maintaining himself or family by agriculture. Vegetables of all the ordinary descriptions succed pretty well, provided you rase a wall sufficiently high to protect them; turnips will, however, grow without shelter.
The inability to live by cultivation is not confined to the pensioner class. Up to the present time no settler in the Falkland Islands has ever maintained himself by agriculture alone, and the numerous experiments I made (most of them at my private expense) convince me that it is impossible to do so. Wherever the soil is not pure peat it is mixed uu with heavy stones, and it cost me about 301. to clear aud prepare one acre in a selected situation for a crop of turnips, and, although I manured it with guano in one part and stable manure 'nud blood in another, the crop in no wav recompensed the outlay. I repeated the experiment after two years with no better result. In gardens, however, I have seen with extreme care turnips as fine, although not quite so large, as I have ever seen in this country. My trials to raise wheat, barley, oats, &c., were complete failures. In one instance only I obtained a tolerable sample of barley, grown under the shelter of a wall. As Mr. Eddy has introduced Lord Grey's namo in his letter, I will merely say that as regards the steps I took for the settlement of the pensioners I met with his Lordship's approval, aud having trausmitted the samples of grain I attempted to raise Lord Grey agreed with me in thinklng it inexpedient to encourage further experiments. The staple produce of the Falkland Islands hitherto has been the wild cattle, and, although thereis no doubt thataincetheGoverment diposed of the entire property over them and all other wild animals in the island, including horses and pigs, to-first, MX Lafone, of Montevideo, who subsequently sold his contract, with the consent of Her Majesty's Government, to the Falkland Islands Company, the present possessors, the numbers of them have largely decreased. There are and always have been, however, sufficient to supply numerous shipping, both mercantile and naval, touching at the ports with fresh beef, to which the settlers and storekeepers were enabled to add during the last five years of my office vegetables, occasionally fish and provisions of every sort.
I am therefore surprised that MIr. Eddy should have fallen into the mistake of supposing that Australian ships are unable to procure refreshments at the Falkdand Islands. I admit that, occasionally, the stock of poultry was deficient, but the impossibility of raising grain or of importing it at prices to induce large breeding of fowls is an answer to that alegation. Rabbits at one dollar per do7en, and any number of wild geese at Is. each, form, however, some substitute for the scarcity of domestic fowls.
Mr. Eddy likewise assumes that no facilities for repairs of shipping exist at the Falkland Islands. I have no memoranda of the number of ships refitted, but I recollect in one week seven large vessels coming into port, most of them seriously damaged, and all (except one,which was condemned as unseaworthy) repaired and forwarded on their voyages. Another instance I recollect of an American ship of 800 tons which struck on a roek and tore off all her false keel and part of her kelson. This ship was refitted, and returned to the United States. I feel it due to the exertions I made, in conjunction with the colonists, to render the islands useful to the vast number of shipping passing them to copy a letter I received from Captain Barnard, R.N., of Her Majesty's ship Vixen, which entered the harbour in a dis. abled state:-
" Stanley IHarbour, June G, 1853.
"Sir,-I beg to acknowledge with many thanks the receipt of your Excellency's letter of the 4th inst., offering all the aid in the power of the local Goverment should I experienc any dilficulty in procuring supplies oF coals, provisions, an1d stores required for HEor Mlajesty's steamer under mny command. Fortunately, I have been enabled to Isupply all our w ants from the stores of MIr. Dean (Lloyd's agent) at sO reasonable a rate that I have taken on board 300 tbns of coals and a large quantity of biscuit, flour, and .ugar, and shall not have to trench on the Government depots, excepting for a small quantity of wide plank, spe. cified in the enclosed requisition.
" On my return to Montevideo I shall consider it my duty to report to the Commander-in-Chief the great facilities that now exist at the FaUdand Islands for coaling, watering, and procuring every requisite necessary at the shortest possible notice for a much less price thanat any other place between this and England. The arrangements for watering will enable the largest ship to complete in a day.
"I have, &c.,

"Commanding Her Majesty's ship Vixen. "His Fxcellency Governor Reanie."
Having thus explained the state of the Falkland Islands as they were whLn I left them about a year since, I shall only offer a very brief reply to Mr. Eddy as to my reasons for this,kis,g them ineligible for the foundation of a large colony of convicts.
A gaol may be formed on any given site, and prisoners may be coerced to work and to sabmit to discipline. On those points no difference of opinion exists; but the question undecided is where that site is to be selected. I have already, in your journal of the 5th inst., given, under the signature of " A Practical Man," my views as to the lo:alities I think most eligible. I wil therefore only now discuss the special merits of the Falkland Islands.
Let ns suppose an expedition fitted out on a large scale, with a1l the needfal appliances for forming a settlement. For the first year or moro full employment wil be found fir all the convicts in building prisons, guardhouses, &c. Those works completed, what is to be undertaken with any reasonable prospect of beneficial or remunerative result 2 In my evidence before the committee of the Hcuse of Lords, last session, June 24, I replied, in answer to a question of the chairinan (Lord Harrowby), that with the exception of a patent slip for the repair of shipping, there &Te, as far as I can judge, no public works of any great utilty required of AUflicient importance to employ a large body of convicts; and as the machinery of the slip must be made in England, its erection would not involve great lagbour. As to the docks, suggested first by Lord Grey, and alluded to by M-.
Eddy, I was of opinion when on the islands, and subsequent consultations with eminent civil engineers since my return convince me, that the nature of the ground and slight rise of the tides (only about six feet) would ronder their construction, if not impracticable, at all events so costly as to make the attempt highly inexpedient. The facility of water carriage aU ronnd the islands is so great that roads, if made, would never be used for heavy goods, and no settler on his unshod horses would ride on them. Draining might to a considerable extent be earried on, but to move large parties and to guard them in different localities, to cut drains for land of little or no value, could scarcely be advantageous in any point of view. After the cattle of the Falkland Islands the fisheries may be reckoned the pursuit next in importance; but surely that is an em. ployment unsuited to prisoners who, with the necessary boats , equired, might escape on board of whalers, who are, especcially the Americans, not at all particular as to whom they engage. The cattle farmers can never employ any number of prisoners, and nearly the whole of the criminals must bo maintained by the Government. The term of punishment expired, is there any reasonable probability of the manumitted settling voluntarily on the islands? My experience convinces me to the contrary. Notwithstanding the high wages procurable by artisans and labourers, the former, if shipwrights, earning sometimes 4 and 5 dollars per diem, the latter from 4s. to Gg., few of them remain permanently, and the small population is kept up chiefly by fresh arrivals. The hardships endured by the fishermen, although their gains are sometimes considerable, prevent their continuing for any length of time to follow that occupation, and the facilities which now exist for every man who can pull a rope to obtain service on board of the shipping touching at the islands enables the industrious to carry off their earnings to any part of the world, or the idle and vicious to change their residences.
I, moreover, doubt exceedingly the great safety of the Falkland Islands as a prison. If you make regulations of a very stringent character you will diminish the attractions of tho islands as a touching port for refits and refreshment. No vessels excepting under circumstances of real distress would ever come there, as the freedom and healthy recreations of the crews and passengers would be seriously interfered with for the necessary seenrity of the convicts, and of course if the discipline is less perfeet escape would by no means be difficult.
The convicts during their sentences would despair of ever settling permanently in a colony, which, although healthy, offers so few pleasurable or profitable prospects, and as soon as freed the able-bodied among them would quit the islands, leaving the helpless or idly-disposed a permanent burden on the Government.
Yours,

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Will you permit me to add a few words to thoso of sour correspondent in this day's paper ?
My experience as a seaman about tho Falidand Islands and Tierra del Fuego while in command of the Fuegian Mission schooner during the past two years enables me to conf6rm what Mr. Eddy has advanced on the subject; and I consider that it would be an immense boon to the commercial and nautical world were the Falkland Islands made a penal settlement.
That the colonists would not object to it I know to be the case from what I have frequently heard them say; and also from what his ExceUency the present Governor has often told me; indeed, I believe that some request has already been made to the Home Government in reference to it.
Of the advantages to be derived by all classes who have an interest in onr shipping and commerce I wilU not now dwell, rnoro than to say that I am conNinced many vessels that now pass the Falklands owing to circumstances connected with the difficulty in getting repairs speedily executed would, were it a penal settlement with abundant labour at command, caU there instead of going to Montevideo. I am ondeavouring to attract attention to this subject in a narrative of my cruise I am prep-aring for the press; but I shall be happy to give any public information in my power that may lead to so desirable an object and such a boon to Cape Horn mariners as the establishment of a penal settlement in the Falkland Islands.
With regard to the Fuegian Mission, Mr. Eddy is under a slight mistake as to its being loeated on East Falkland. It ii on one of the west islands, and there are circumstances connected with it shortly to be made pablic that wil show that there can be very little fear of any hindrance being evinced on their part to any plan for the deportation of our convicts to the Falkland Islands. The " pecnliar privileges granted to the mission" consist, I believe, only in the permission to chooso a small portion of land in the West Falklands, and purchase it at the usual price without havinit first submitted to competition by public auction. When I left the Falklands in November last the purchase had not been effected.

England And France.
BN&ZAND AND FRANCB.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir, -In TVe Tims of Monday, the 19th, there is a letter signed "Q.," on the subject of the French and English alliance. The writer of it shows such complete ignorance of the state in which France stands in her relation with England that I think it my duty to protest against such serious and dangerous errors. Your correspondent pre. tends, firstly, that the war which is now ended was never popular in France; secondly, that the alliance has in no way changed the feelings of antipathy which exist in the hearts of almost all Frenchraen against England; thirdly, that not one of the political parties wvhich divide France is better disposed, taken singly, to love the English than the French are, taken as a whole.
And in support of such serious assertions your corraspondent gives as sole proof the opinion of a Russian officer, related by a French officer after the conclusion of peace, and, above all, after dinner-no doubt between coffee and cognac.
As this letter is such as to give extremely false opinions to a large number of your readers through tho mediam Of your extensively circulated paper, I think it right to reply by tho following facts:-
1. Tho war which is now concluded was very popular in France during its whole duration. The reception of the Queen, the tone of the most popul%r newspapers, the large number of voluntary enlist. ments, the bravery and brotherhood of the army, the manner in which the victories were celebrated, are, I hope, sufficient proofs of it ; but, should more bewanting, I would draw your attention to the state of the public funds, and the rapidity with which two loans of 750,000,OOOf. were raised by the mass of the nation. Who wiU believe after this that the war was unpopular in France?
No doubt the disasters of our armies moved many hearts, but where could we find in France similar manifestations to the numerous meetings which were caUed in England in favour of peace?
2. The personal sentiments of the Frenchfor the English far from being those of antipathy, are, on the contrary, those of true sympathy, and it may be said that since 1820, and still more since 1830, there have never been any popular manifestations against England, though several have taken plaeo against other Powers. But if our habits of thought and manners are observed, some of your countrymen wil doubtless be astonished that the eustoms, the sciences, the arts, and literature of England are muol better known in France, and have much more influence, than any French customs, industry, or literature have in England. In what other nation is English so generally spoken ? In what country are the English language and English literature required at the university examinations ? Where will you find as many translations of Shakqsearc (considered in France as the greatest poet of modern timos), of Byron, Arilton, Scol, Swift, Stcrne, &c.? What nation is better acquainted than we are with the labours of your chymists, yonr physicians, your philosophers, and your doctors-of Davy, Faraday, Playfair, Leslie, Horace Say, Cobden, Hunter, &c. ? In what other language will you find so great a number of English words adopted into general use? Where wil you meet with as many phrases expreSsive of admirationi, a " une distinction Anglaise," "u une beaut6 Anglisis," " des manieres de gentleman,'
Cc une generosite Britannique," &c. ? What nation receives the English with as much cordiality as the French? And, if the feeling of hatred, which your correspondent pretends finding among the French, realy existed, how is it that the English show so great a preference for a residence in France-as Paris, the shore of the British Channel, Pau, and the Mediterranean coast, can testify ? Would the proudest people on earth ever condescend to reside in a country the inhabitants of whieh are their enemies?
As to political parties, every one knows that they love those who support them, and that England supports no party in Franee. In truth, Sir, I do not know where your correspondent has gathered his information, in what classes, rmiddling or low ; but his letter appears to be the echo of an ill-disguised personal discontent.
I have not spoken of the political interests which unite the two nations, but in point of feeling I can affirm that no twvo nations were ever so intimately united as England and France are st this day; and that if any difference exists in their mutual moral influence one upon the other, the influence of England in France is far greater than any influence we exert among the English.

and Afr. Justice WTILLTI
AnDs appeal was rgunea somo tlme back before tho Lord Chancellor, and stood over for judgment. It will be recol lected that the plaintiff, a market gardener at Fulham, sought to restrain the defendants from makinggas in certain retort-houses adjoining his premises, on the ground that his pToperty was injuriously affected thereby. One of the points raised was that the plaintiff had no nght to come into a court of eq,uity, as the 68th section of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act pointed out the remedy for an injury of the descIption complained of-namely, compensation to be awarded by a jury. The Lord Chancellor called in tho assistance of two common law judges, and directed the cies to be argued on that point by one counsel on each side.
Mr. J. Wilde (of the common law bar) appeared for the company; Mr. Selwyn for the plaintiff.
Wilde will be heard in reply on Monday next.
(Before the LORDS JUSTIcBS of APPEAL.)
SMITH V. LAKELS.
Mr. RiddeU was called as a witness in this case on behalf of the plaintiff, and, in auswer to questions put to him by Mr. CBAio, he deposed that he knrew of the agreement between Captain Smith and Mr. Lakeman as to the 10,000 shares in the Liberty mine in dispute in the cause. He was to bave a one-third share of the produce of their sale after paying 1U. per share, the other two-thirds to be paid to Eimith and Lakeman. Never gave LAkeman any directions as to fictitious sales of tne shar Lakeman p to keep books of the sale transactions: oad h rd th . man had spoken of investments he had made of the produce or part of it-as to some in London and Birmingham shares, and as to other parts in acargoof pigiron. Had seen the Liberty mines, and took possession of them on behalf of the company, and was himself a direct4r of the LAber,ty Company.
Mr. WIORA deolined to cross-examine Mr. Riddel<
Lord Jcstico Knight BRUCE requested the witness to remain near London, as he would be wanted at Guildhal in abaut three weeks.

Their LORDSHirS then proceeded to settle the issues to be tried.
CAM%P33ELL V. CORLEY.
The last stage, so far as the Court of Chancery is concerned, of this " strange, eventful history " was this day brought to a close by the reply of Mr. Wigram on behaff of the plaintiff, Mr. Campbell. Daring this address the learned counsel dealt with the theory adopted by Mr. Corley's counsel-namely, that the marriage had been resorted to by Mrs. Campbel as a means by which she might secure the reformation of her son, as a most lame and impotent conclusion. The fact of the marriage was kept a secret, until the aged and deluded lady had breathed her last, from the man whose reformation could ,only be expected to be effected by its disclosure.
Their LoRDpsnurs have reserved judgment.
Mr. DA_NMEL, on behalf of the defendant, said that, ia order to put an end to all this litigation, Mr. Corley was wining to compromise on the following terms :-Mr. Corley to retain a life interest in the funds be9ueathed by Mr. Gost is wiU(his titleto which is now admitted to be unimpeachabi7e), or to sell it to Ar. CampbeU at a valuation; to give up to Mr. Campbell all the savings, except 1,O000. and such further sum as would indemnify him against the costs of the proceedings in the ecclesiastical courts and elsewhere in respect hof this property; Mr. Corley to consent to a recall of the letters of administration, and that letters of administration to the estate should be granted to Mr. Camp. bell.
Mr. WIGiANis.-I must consult Mr. Campbell. Although I think a compromise may be effected, I do not think it desirable that Mr. Corley should mention a sum to be retained by him for costs.
Lord Justice K.1G11T BRUcE.-Everything must be determined, or the war wilbreak outagain. The mattermay be mentioned to-morrow morning i and, in the meantime, Mr. Church should make some easimate of the amount Mr. Corley wiU accept in lieu of costs. Mr. Campbell can also consider on what terms he will compromise.

STAISTON V. THE MELTROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS.-
JTIDGNIST-
(Beforc the MASTER OF THE ROLLS.)
The AMASTER of tle ROLLS gave judgmentin this case, the facts of whichhavobeen previously reported, and are briefly as follows:-Tho plaintiffs are the trustees under the will of the late Mr. Stainton, of Lewisham, who during his lifetime had expended considerable sums of money upon the gardens and gronnds attached to his house. Among other things, Mr. Stainton had brought some water from an adjoining field into his gardens, and had it con%erted into ornamental streams and rivulets. In 1855 the then Commissioners of Sewers opened a main sewer through the town of Lewisham and this seoer and another branch one the Metropolitan Board of Works had since continued and carried out. These sewers had completely drained off the water from Mr. Stainton's gardens, and the object of the present suit was to restrain the Metropolitan Board of W orks from keeping the sewers open to the detriment of Mr. Stainton's property, and from in any way interfering with it for the future. H is Honour considered the Metropolitan Board of Works were only doing what their act gave them the power to do for the benefit of the public health, but at the same time expressed an opinion that the plaintiffs were entitled to reasonable compensation upon the principle laid down in the 10th and 11th of Victoria, c. 112; the material provisions of which act, as far as compensation was concerned, were repeated and embodied in the Mletropolitan Board of VWorks Act.
Mr. R. Palmer, Mr. L3win, and Mr. Kenyon aDpeared for the plaintiffs ; the Attorney-General, Mr.- Hall, and Mr. Haynes for the Metropolitan Board of Works; Mr. Selwyn and Mr. Steere for the Lewisham District Board.

DEVOY V. DEVOY.
(Bcfore Vice-ChVancdllor Sir J. STuA iT.
This was a bill for the purpose of obtaining a retransfer to the plaintiff of a sum of 200L Ne wThree per Cents., standing in the joint names of himself, his wife, and child. In 1848, the plaintiff, who was then a fellowship porter, transferred the above sum of stock into the joint names of himself, his wife, and child, but made no declaration of trust relative thereto, and he had ever since received the dividends thereon. Three or four years ago he met with an accident on the river, which obliged him to relinquish his former occupation; and he now sought to have the sum of stock beforenained retransferred into his own name alone. Insupport of his claim he stated in his affidavit that when he made the transfer into the names of himself, his wife, and child, he had no intention of placing the stock entirely out of his power, but intended merely to form a rescrve fund to which he might resort in case of need.
Mr. J. De LONGURcILLE GIFFARD appeared for the plaintiff.
Mr. SxYTHR, for the child, contended that the plaintiff's evidence was not admissible, and that he had effectually given at least one half of the fund to his child, and cited nutmerous cases in support of his contention.
3Mr. COTTON appeared for the Bank of England.
The VI E-CBANCELLOR said that he thought the plain. tiffs evidence was admissible, although it was open to observation. The effect of the transfer of the stock into the joint names of the plaintiff, his wife, and child was to raise a presumption that the transaction was intended as an advancement, but that presumption might be rebutted by evidence showing its real nature; and here he thought that the plaintiff's evidence showed that he did not intend an unqualified advancement to his child. There must thereforo bo a decree directing the stock to be retransforred to the plaintiff.
(Bcfore Yzce-ChanscNor Sir W. P. WOOD.)
AiTUSsETT V. 31SKsrTT.
The hearing of this case was resumed and occupied the entire day.
Mr. CAIRNS, on behalf of the defendant, commented at considerable length upon the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs and the discrepancies apparent in it, and urged upon the Court that the facts elicited on cross-examination, coupled with the evidence adduced by the defendant, were sfficiently clear to show the perfect bona fides with which the arrangement had been entered into by him, and the impossibility of the plaintiffs bein- now beard to say, after an interval of nearly five years, that there had been any surprise or pressure in the matter or any concealment fromi them Ol their rights under thse testamentary disposition made by pa r. Mt smtt5 or (in the case of his widow) as to her irht to dower or thirds out of his estate. With respect to such alleged right of dower, moreover, it was clear upon the authorities (to which the learned counsel referred) that the terms of the will were such as to raise a case of election on the part of the widow between the benefit given to her thereby and her legal right to dower. The gsving her the option of residing at the mansion-houso, the charging the whole of his real estate with the payment of the aunuities
.the giving to his daughter, Mrs. Etheredge, powvers of distress and entry over the whl;ole of such real estate as a fur. ther security for her anuuity, the direction to the defenda nt to keep the whole of the property in repair and insuredall these clauses were inconsistent with the widow's right to have the land set out in metes and bounds, and were a suffi. cient indication of the testator's intention that his widow should not have both her dower and the benefits given her by the wilL This being so, the substituted anuity of 3004 given to Mrs. Muskett by the agreement now sought to be set aside was greater than the annuity Oiven by the Will, though somewhat less than the dower, which, no doubt, she might have possibly elected to claim. The objec. ticn that the annuitieS given by the will were actuially charged upon the estate, whereas those substituted by the agreement were only secured by the personal covenant of the defendant, was met by the obtervation that any deed which might be framed to carry out the agreenent would, or, at all SveDts, could, be framed in such a way, by means of the intervention of a trustee as to secure the due payment of those anuuities to the nlaiutiffs. The learned coussel concluded by urging tah Xt delay of the plaintiffs in lnstitutinz this suit was alone suf. ficient to preclude tbem from all rlief.
hIr. BAGGALLAT was heard on the same ide, and at the conclusion of his arguments,
The VICE-C1UACELLOR said that it would timpossible tha.t theagreement could be allowed to stand. Withoutwish. ing to impute Malaffdes to any of the parties, it was quite clear upon the evidence that the agreesuent had been carried out wit an improptr haste, and had been sigued by the plaintiffs under an improper pressure. With respect to the baste, there Seemed to have been Do Possible season for it. The evidence showed that this agree. imEnt had been signed by Mrs. Muskett under the impres$ion and from an auxiety that an income should be secured to her; but it was to be observed that an income wea already secured to her by the will, if valid, and, w hether valid or invalid, by the legal right to dower which accrued to her on her husband's aeath-facts which were inconsistent with the supposition that sli was aware of those riglhts when the agreement was signed. It had been said that she bad been legally advised in the matter, but how could the Couit attaoh any weight to that circurm-
stance, when it was clear upon the evid nce that the person by whom she was advised was himself the first person to raise doubts as to the validity of the w D1, and had not taken even t'e most ordinary pains to ascertain, between the death and funeral of the testator, whether the vill had or bad not been formally executed, or wh Lt was the amount of the dower having regard to th? renal of the estates; while, on the other hard, it was abundantly clear tbat the defendant had bEen cormpi g l9d timein ascertainthese at least some of these facts. Vith respect to ZIrs. Etheredge, the daughter, the case -was very remarkable, and the most remarlkble part of it was that she bad never been consulted at all in the matter, though it had beenl said that Ier mother acted for her, bat the evidence showed no delegation of any suoh authority. It certainly appeared that ner brotber-in-]aw, Mr. Dashwood, had objecttd to her giving up 100. a-year, snd in consequence of such objection hadbeen met with an observation fromu the defendant, as to the precise terms of which there certainly was some con. flict of evidence, bat which, at all events, induced Mr. Dashwood to leave the house. That protest ought to have been sufficient to prevent their hurrying on with the agree. ment, but this was not so, and he miust say that the haste by which the wholetransaction had been characterized was very much to be deplored. WVith respect to the agreement itself, the whole frame of it also showed abundant evidence of haste. It contained no recital of any intention to bar dower, and no mention of the daughter's contingent reversionary interest; though as to this, his Honour observed, he was willing to believe that it really did not occur to the par. ties as a necessary thing to be referred to. Atoreover, the defendant had sacrificed nothing by the agreement, power being left him to dispute the will or liot, as he liked. The argument as to delay could not affect the case, there being nothing to show that Mrs. Muskett bad not on the firt suspicion of her rights taken prorer steps to have the agreement cancelled. It must be set aside, and the defendant, not having availed himself of the o%ertures which bad been made, must pay the cests up to the hearing. For the purpose of having the other questions spolken to, namely, as to the right which the defendant night now have to try the validity of the will, and also as to the question of election on the p art of the widow, the care might be put in the paper on T hursday next;.

COLERIDGE and W1.n11rNT.vA I
'hiBs case came before the Court on the 7th of November last upon a demurrer to the replication to the defendant's 3d and 6th pleas. The defendant was the public officer of the lnion Bank of London, and the action was brought to recover a sum of money due to Sarah Shuter, deceased, whose executor the plaintiff was. The defendant pleaded paysent to Sarah Shuter h'Gill, the plain tiff's co- executrix, The plaintiff replied that Sarah Shuter M'Gill was the wife of Peter M'Gill, and that she was appointed and acted as executrix without the knowledge and assent of her husband. The question was whether the payment to the plaintiff's co-executrix was, under these circumstances, a good payment.
Mr. H. Hill, Q.C., washeard in support of the demurrer; and Mr. R. Clarke in support of the replication.
LJ,rd CA31PBELL now delivered the judgment of the Court in favour of the defendant. The bond fi(de payment of the debt to the wife, executrix without the knowvledge or assent of the husband, was not void; and the defendant might well presume that she had the assent of her husband. The Court was of opinion that judgment should be given for tco defendant on the special replication to the 3d and Gth pleas.
BIUSLNESS OF TIHE COURT.
Lord Cs'mPBELL said that, on examnining into the state of the business in the court, he found that arrears were aceumnlating, and therefore it would be necessary for the Court after term to sit in banco. The Court would there. fore sit on the 2d and 3d of February, on the 9th and 10th of February, and on the 24th of February, to give judgment. On the first four days the cases in the dijferent papers would be taken, and an intimation would be given to the bar in what order they would be taken.
THE QUEEN V. DBUiN AND ANOTHER, JUSTICES OF SUSSEX.
In this case a rule had been granted calling upon two justices of Sussex to show cause why they should not issue their warrant to enforce payment of a lighting and watching rate, assessed upon a Mr. Sampson, an inhabitant of Hailsham. It appeared that a meeting of all the inhabitants of the parish was held on the 11th of November, 1853, to consider whether the provisions of the Lighting and Watching Act (the 3d and 4th of WiUiansi IV., chap. 90) should be adopted in the parish. The act required the consent of two-thirds of those present, but as such consent was not obtained the proposal was negatived. In tlle course of the next mnonth-viz., on the 1st of December-another meeting was held, consisting of the town inhabitants only within a radius of half-a-mile, and it was then determined that the grovisions of the act should be adopted within that district. Sampson, who was a farmer living just within the circle of the district, paid the first rate ; but when the second rate was demanded he refused. On being summoned before the magistrates, he objected that the meeting at which the act was adopted was an ilegal meeting, it being provided by the act tnt no second Imeeting for the adoption of the act should be held within 12 months from the first meeting. The magistrates inquired into the facts, when it appeared that the town distnct contained a population of 90b rated inhabitants, 210 acres, and rateable property of the value of 1,6460.; whereas the whole parish contained a population of 210 rated inhabitants, 2,283 acres, and Tateable property of the value of 7,1171. Upon these facts the magistrates decided that the second meeting was substantially the same as the first, that it was an illegal meeting, and that the rate was void. The present rule was then obtained.
Mr.Lvs1i now showedcauseagairst the rule, and contended that, as the inagistrates had decided thefact that the second meeting was substantia31y the same as the first, the Court could not review their decision.
Mr. PASHLEY, Q.C., in support of the rule contended that, Sampson was estopped, by having once paid the rate, from taking such an objection; and that the decision of the magistrates on the facts was clearly wrong.
1ord CAMPBELL, in the course of the argument, observed that the Court would have great disinclination to interfere with the adoption of the act where its adoption had been acquiesced in by payment of the rate, as in this case - but his Lordship thought that, as the magistrates had decided, though wrongly, a matter within their jurisdiction, this Court ought not to interfere to disturb their decision. His Lordship added that there was nothing to prevent the in. spectors from making application to other magistrates for a warrant; and though he should have been better pleased if they had decided otherwise, this Court had no jurisdiction to reverse what wras done.
The other judges being of the same opinion, the rule was discharged, but without costs.
HENDERSON V. THE ROYAL BRITISH IAUNI.:
In this case the plaintiff had recovered judgment against the Royal British Bank, but, the judgment not being satisfed, he applied for leave to issue execution upon the goods of one Go dard, a shareholder of the company. Goddard had brought a sum of money into court, and the rule no
to be argued was why the plaintiff should not be allowed to take the money out of court.
Mr. H. HILL, Q.C and Mr. MELLIS11 now showed cause against the rule, and contended that Goddard was not liable to have execution levied against him, on the ground that he had been induced to become a shareholder by the fraud and misrepresentations of the directors. The company had obtained a supplemental charter, by which they were authorized to issue an additional number of shares - and Goddard had been induced to take a number of these shares by the representation of the directors that the affairs of the bank were in a rmost flourishing condition, and that they had a reserve fund to aLn enormous amount. These representation;, it had since been discovered, were false, andamust have been soto the knowledge of the directors. As the contract was obtained by fraud it was voidable. As soon as Goddard discovered the fraud he disafJirmed the contract, and from that time he ceased to be a shareholder though he could be held to be a shareholder down to that time.
Lord CAUPBELL.-The question is, was he not a shareholder at the time this application was made ?
Mr. JusticeW1GHT3r1AuN.-Is he on the list of shareholders? Mr. HIL, said he was, and if that was binding he was liable. Mr. JUstiCe WIGOT3AN.-ZWhat did he do to disaffirn the contrast?
Mfr. HiLL.-As soon as he discovered the fraud, which was when the company was adjudged bankrupt, hc disaffirmed the contract by carrying in his claim to be admitted as a creditor of the company.
Lord CAMIPBELL said, it was an alarmaiLg doctrine that as soon as a bank had stopped payment a shareholder could evade his liability by claiming to be a creditor of the bank.
Mr. HILL sai the question could only arise where, as in the present case, new shareholders had been induced to take
shares.
Mr. Justice COnaRInDGB said, there had been cases in the courts where the original shareholders had been induced to become such by the fraud of directors. His Lordship inquired whether the same point had not arisen in the other courts ?
Mr. HiLL. said it had, and it had been argued in the Court of Common Pleas that, as the question had been raised in all the courts, the Court of Common Pleas had reserved its judgment with the intention of consulting the other judges. The learned counsel contended that, by the 21st section of the 7th and 8th of Victoria, chap. 113, the persons whose names vere on the list of shareholders were to be hiable as such; andi, by the 16th section, the memorial of the shareholders was Ito be made out within three muonths from the time when the letters patent were granted, which was not done in this case. The list was, therefore, not conclusive.
Mr. ASPLAND having been heard in support of the rule,
Lord CAMsPBELL said the Court would take time to consider, and would confer with the judges of the other courts.
BROWN V. TEE NEWPORT DOCK COMP,NY.
This was an action brought by the charterer of a coal ship, the Queen of Prussa, to recover damages from the Newport Dock Company for improperly removing the plaintiffs ship from its berth iu the dock, in order to make room for another vessel, the Cinderella. At the trial, which took place before Mr. Justice Wightman at the last assizes for the county of Monmouth, the defendants' counsel objected -lirst, that the action could not be maintained, on the ground that the 139th section of the comnpany's act providedapenaltyfor anypartiality by the dockmaster, and that that remedy only must be pursued; secondly, he con. tended that the action should havo been brought by the captain, and not by the plaintiff, between whom and the defendants therevwas no priority; and, thirdly, that the defendants were only answerable for the acts done by the dockmaster withj* the scope of his authority, and not for acts done maMfidf7. The learned judge directed the jury to fnd a verdict for the plaintiff, with 151 damages, but gave the defendant leave to move the Court to enter the verdict for the defendants, or a nonsait on the points reserved
* Mr. Keating, Q.C., nd Mr Gray now showed cause against the rule, which was supported by Mr. Alexander, Q.C,, and Sir Thomas PhOiips.
The Court gave judgment only on one point,-viz,, that the company were not liable.
. Lord CArPEsaidd ho was of opinion that the rule ought to be made absolute to enter a nonsuit, The action was brought to recover damages for a malfeasance on the
psrt of the dockmaster, and it was a general rule that a
.uperior was not liab2e for the malfeasance of his servant. i The dockmaster was made by the act an independent functionary, and the evidence did not show that the company had been in any way cognizant of his acts. IThe action ought to have been brought against the dockmaster, and flit against the company.
The other judges concurred.
Rule absolute to enter a nonsuit.
BRITTAIN V. TIHE LONDON AND XORTIIO-WESTERN RlAIL-
WgAY COMIPANY.
In this case a rule had been granted for a new trial, on the ground of misdirection, and that the verdict was against the evidence. The action was brought by the plaintiff, formerly a clerk in the goods departnient of the London and North-Western Railway Company, to recover from the company his arrears of salary. It appeared at the trial, which took place at the last assizes for the county of Susex before the Chief Baron, that the hiring was at so much per annum, nothing being said about notice. The wages were at first paid by the quarter, but afterwards monthly. After some years the plaintidt was dismissed with a month's notice. This action was then brought, and the question arose at the trial whether the notice was sufficient, or whether, as the plaintiff contended, he was entitledl to six months' notice. The Chief Baron said he thought the notice ought to have been a reasonable notice, and amended the plea in order to admit of the defence that the notice given was a reasonable one. Ei4Lordship, however, told the Jury that if they thought there was a yearly hiring, but believed that the wages vwero paid monthly, a month's notice was a xeasonable notice. The jury were of the same opinion, and found their verdict for the defendants. This rule was subsequently obtained.
Mr. BOVILL, Q.C., and Mr. HoitACE LLOYD now showed cause against the rule, and contended that there was no rule of law that in the case of a clerk there ought to be six nionths' notice, and that the question had been properly left to the jury whether the notice was a reasonable one.
Mr. JoYcE, who appeared in support of the rule, was stop3ped by
Lord CAa1PBELL, who said he was not prepared to lay down a rule of law upon the subject, but the verdict was not satisfactory. Tho jury were not in a situation to give an unbiassed verdict without evidence on one side or the other. With regard to domestic servants, he (Lord Campbell) would not hesitate in taking notice of the usage that where there was a yearly hiring it could be determined by a month's notice or a month's wages. But in this case which was that of a railway servant at a yearly salary payable monthly, the jury had found that there was a yearly hiring, but without any evidence they found that a month's notico was a reasonable notice. Re (Lord Campbell) thereforo thought there ought to be a new trial, though he would not lay down any rule of law upon the subject.
l.ule absolute.

(Sittizgs at Nisi Pritus, before Mr. Justice EELE.)
IIOOLE v. YODDAN.
Mr. Overend and Mr. Hall were counsel for the plaintiff, and Mr. O'Malley and Mr. Spinks for the defendant.
The plaintiffs were attorneys and solicitors at Sheffield. The defendant hept a beershop there, and adjoining it was a very large hall, called "The Surrey Music-hall," where singing and dancing were carried on, and it was, in fa^t, what is called a casino. The plaintiff:s, as attorneys, had conducted divers businesses for the d fendasit, and the amount claimed for this was 361. 17s. 9P. The defendant had pleaded a set-off, and had paid 151. into court.
The plaintiff stated that the business had been done, and that the charges were correct; he had been Mayor of the town of Sheffield, and upon one occasion one of the members for the town (Mr. Hadfield) had intended to address his constituents at the Guildhall, and the plaintiff was invited to preside at the meeting as Mayor. The meetingtook place at the Guildhall, but it being very much crowded there was a cry for an adjournment to the Music-hall. The plaintiff stated that no alteration had been muade in the Music-hail by his direction.
The defence was, that when the meeting was spoken of tbe plaintiff's partner and defendant had a conference, and it was said that it would be a good thing to show the persons who might attend what a splendid haDl they had in the town, but the defendant said great alterations must be made in the hail; the plaintiff said, " Let them be made, and let the whole thing be done well " the defendant then had the alterations made, which amounted to a considerable sum - and the question then arose as to the party who was to pay for them.
The defendant said he had spent a large suni upon this hall, which would hold 3,000 persons. It was acknowledged by every one to be tbe most respectable place of amusement in Sheffield. He was also a printer, and bills were printed at his office relative to the meeting by direction of Mr. Hoole's partner, who, on the 13th of January, 1855, told him they were going to have a meeting, which was to be opened at the Town-hal), to receive Mr. Hadfield, who was coming to give an account of his stewardship. He asked defendant what would be his charge for his hall? The defendant said he should not be very particular about charging on that occasion, and he would give the use of the hail if they would pay for the gas and cleaning, and other little things wanted to be done. Plaintiff's partner (Mr. Yow. man) eomplimented defendant upon his liberal feeling, and he told him that Lord Goderich, Mr. Cobden, and others would attend, which would do honour to his hall. On the following day defendant was again sent for from the plaintiff's office. Defendant went to the office and saw Mr. Yowman, who said they were anxious that on that day he should not sell any beer. Defendant promised he would not. Mr. Yowman said his hall bad the appearance of a theatre, wings, &c. ; they wished him to remove that appearance and make it a beautifnl room. The defendant said that wonld take a considerable sum of money, but he would take the most reasonable course he could. Mr. Yowman said he must not go to mnih expense, but he must make it as neat and nice as he possibly could, and he reminded the defendant that this would be a great acquisition in raising his place in the opinion of the public, and show that they were not behind other towns. The defendant then gave instructions to his carpenter and artist to make the necessary alterations. They worked all day Saturday till 12 o'cloc-k at night. They went on again on the Monday. He had carpets put down, and chairs and tables introduced. It was all ready by 9 o'clock on the Wednesday morning. The meeting, however, did not take place at his ball. The whole charge was 641. 7s., but he had taken off all but money paid, vhich was 211.-there was not, therefore, one farthing profit to himself. He often sent his manager to the plaintiff's for a settlement. After eight or nine months he had a letter from the plaintiff applying for the payment of their account. He had met Mr. Yowman in the street, who asked him if he was prepared to settle the account? The defendant said "Yes," at any time they would allow his set-off. Mr. Yowman said the defendant's bill was a very dishonest one. The defendant said it was time it was settled one way or another.
Cross-examined.-Mr. Broadbent and Mr. H. Yowman were present at the interview with the plaintiff's partner. Was only anxious to serve the gentlemen. Did notask any person to take the room. Did not send any person into the Town-hall to call out for an adjournment to his hall. Hadt
vote. Gave his vote and cared nothing more about the election. Mr. H. Hoole called on the morning of the intended meeting and saw the room. Believed Mr. Broadbent called also, but did not speak to him; he had been at his casino many a time. Did not say to him that he had made no proepation for a meeting, as he had been told the room would not be wanted. His business in the hall was not stopped at all. Sent in bis biMl in July, 1855. In October, 1856, the plaintiff wrote to him, denying having received the delendant's account and altogether repudiating it.
Re-examined.--Many people took their seats in the hall on the day of the meeting expecting the adjournment, 'which did not in fact take place.
James Rigley, a person in the employment of the defendant, proved that the plaintiff's clerk came for the defendant to go to their office, and a clerk of the plaintiff brought the copy for the bil of the adjournment of the meeting to be printed.
Edwin Crook, a bill-pester at Sheffield, on the 15th of January, 1855, received instructions from MIr. Yowman to post the hills of the banquet. Was to get them at the defendant's oflice.
. WVestbrook stated that he was ordered on the morning of the 19th of January by the defendant to be in readiness to sbow the people into the hall, which was then in readiness to receive them. There were a great many people in the hall that morningwaiting for the a journment.
Squire Firth stated that the defendant told him to take in he lantifs'acoun. e dd s i Juy,1855. After that time repeatedly called at the plaintiff's office, and requested settlement of the defendant's account. Upon one occasion saw MIr. Yowman, who said it should be attended to, and shortly after that the plaintiffs sent in their bill to
W. Hall, the defendant's stage carpenter, stated that great alterations were made in the haU. They were at work day and night from the 13th of January to the 19th of
The following witnesses were called for the plaintiff in reply_
Mr. Hoole stated that he did not send for the defendant, nor had he any recollection of having seen him on the 13th of January, 1855, Saw no eharge for the alterations until after he had sent in his own bill and threatened proceedings. Never heard of the alterations.
Mr. Yowman.-There was a committee to give a recep tionto Mr.Haddeld, of which witness was secretary. Ms directed to engage the Town-hall for the Reform Banquet of January, 1855. Paid the defendant 21. for printing. Upon one occasion the defendant said if they wanted his room at any time they might have it. Gave the defendant no autho-
rity to prepare the hai in any way. Did not recoUect any
iterview with the defendant when Broadbent and Henry Rooe were l tresent. The witness positively swore that he had never sasd to the defendant what he had statedas to the conversation between them on the 13th of January, 1855,
nor did he say what it was imputed he had said on the following day, nor anything to that effect. There was not one word of truth in it. Never heard of this claim until they had sent in their account.
Cross-examined.-Before the meeting it was not proposed that there should be an adjournment to the defendant's halL In the bill tothecommitteetherewas a charge for 20 billfor
the adjournment. That bill witness had credited the defendant with.lHe had been asked to get in the bills; that bill came in, and witness gave a recel t for it, and gave the defendant credit for it. Did not this& there had been an interview with the defendant when Broadbent and Henry Hoole were present. Defendant had asked him to use his room. Did not remember that he saw defendant on the evening of the 13th of January. Did not think he saw him on the 14th.
It was here announced that the parties had agreed to withdraw a Juror.
The JuDiGE said that had spared the jury a painful duty, as there was a direct conflict of testimony.
M1UTTON V. PEARY.
Mr. Edwin James and Mr. Hawkins were counsel for the plaintiff; and Mr. O'Malley for the defendant.
This was an action upon a promissory note. The defendant pleaded that he had not endorsed it.
Mr. JAms stated that the question to he raised was whether this note was a forgery. It was well known that a person named Harradine, a farmer in Huntingdonshire, had committed several forgeries and had absconded, and the
*e!tndant alleged that this note was one of those forgeries ; but it was rather a singnlar fact that it was a joint and several note of three persons, and it was attested by a person named Walton. One of the drawers of the note was dead, but he should call one of themp-as well as the witness-who would declare that this was a genuine note.
From the evidence it appeared that Harradine wanted to purchase some grass, and got these parties to sign the note, in order that it might be cashed, and if not cashed it was to be given sp. The note was written by Walton. Two other notes were produced, purporting to be signed by the same pai lies, but three 'witnesses stated that those notes were not the original ones. The real history of the case was this. Feary sold some grass to Harradine, 'who got three friends to sign this note, and Feary to endorse it. Feary delivered the grass to Harradine, who got the note discounted and then absconded. Feary thus lost his hay, and had to pay the note as endorser of the note.
The plaintiff proved having given consideration for the note.
The dUryreturned a verdict for the plaintiff for Mr. O'MALLEY said, the defendant was always ready to pay one bill, but there being two bils of a similar kind, he only wanted to know which was the genuine one.

In this case lr. BOVILI, Q.C., and Mr. SHARPE showed cause against a rule nisi for an injunction, under the Railway and Canal Traffic Act, enjoining the defendants to convey coals for the applicant at the same rate at which they conveyed coals for other parties; and Mr. Serjeant BYLES and Mr. T. JO.XES supported the rule.
It appeared from the affidavits that the defendants' comany had entered into a contract with Messrs. Prior a'nd Co., of Peterborough, to ionvey 240,000 tons of coals for them in three years to Ipswich and other places; and as the railway company were enabled to convey these coals by entire trains at fixed times, and Messrs. Prior's trucks were used, they conveyed them under their contract for one-third less&than they charged the applicants. The applicants contended that this was contrary to the provision of the Railway and Canal Traffic Act, and gave Messrs. Priors an undue advantage over them.
The COURT took time to consider the affidavits on the subject before delivering judgment.

This was an action tried at Westminster, before Mr. Justice Crowder, on Saturday last, when a verdict was found for the plaintiff; damages, 311.
Mr. ATHERTON, Q.C., now moved for a new trial on the grounds of misdirection, and that the verdict was against evidence. The action was brought by the plaintiff to recover damages for kiling his horse, which was kiled in a colision by William Taylor, the defendant's man, running his gig against it and driving the shaft of the gig intO thoe horse. The horse and gig it appeared belonged to Taylor, but he was going on his master's business in it and with the knowledge and assent of his master. His Lordship directed the jury that although the horse and gig were Taylor's, yet if he were usingthem on his master's business the defendant would be liable. The learned counsel complained of this direction, and contended also that on the facts Taylor was partly using the gig on his own business. and that the defendant was not liable.
Rule nisi granted.
rOUND V. DAVISON.
This was an action tried in 3Middlesex before Mr. Justice Crowder, when a verdict was found for the plaintiff; damnages, 201.
Mr. EDLN JAN[Es, Q.C., now moved to set aside the verdict, and for a new trial on affidavits.
The plaintiff, it appeared, had been concerned in a scuffle in which he received damage to his eye and brought his action. The evidence was verv conflicting, and the learned judge summed up for the defendant. The learned counsel now read an affidavit from a surgeon, stating that the injury to the eye was one of long standing, and not in consequence of any blow in the scufflo.-Rule nisi granted.
IN RE ROSSSE.
In this case Mr. M'OUnREY applied for a habeas corpus to bring up the body of Thomas Crosse, a prisoner in the House of Correction at Holloway, in order that he might be discharged. The application was made the other day in the Court of Exchequer and the writ granted, but on the prisoner being brought up he was remitted back to his forner custody. The prisoner had been convicted before theLordMayorofLondon, underthe 5th of George IV., chap. 83, sec. 4, as a rogue and vagabond. That section provided that " every suspected person or reputed thief frequenting any street, highway, or avenue leading thereto, or any place of public resost, or any avenueleading thereto, or any street, highway, or place adjacent with intent to commit a felony, shall be deemed a rogue and vagabond 'and may be comnitted to the House of Correction." The conviction set forth that the applicant was " found" in Railway-place, a public place in the city. The learned counsel now contended that the words of the statute were " frequenting," and that merely being found in a publc place would not do; otherwise all the thieves in London might be at once taken up as they must be " found" somewhere.
Mr. Justice CRESSWELL.-NOt unless they were in the place where "found" with intent to commit a felony. According to your construction, a thief must be found more than once in a place with intent to commit a felony, or he would not be " frequenting" that place.
Mr. M'OUBREY submitted that the statute, being a penal statute and against the liberty of the subject, must be construed strictly. He referred to the report of a case in "Re Bliza Jones," reported in the 16th volume of the Justice of the Peace, in support of this view.
Mr. Justice CREsssWELI,-I have not had the advantage of seeing that publication. What does it profess to report? Cases at petty sessions?
Mr. M'OUBRzY contended that this case supported his view, and referred to Johnson's Dictionary as to the definition of theword "' frequent," which meant " to visit often," end to "resort often" to a place. The word "found" there did not express this meaning, and, strictly constraed, the magistrate bad no power by the statute to commit a man for simnly beint " found" in any place.
Mr. Justice (R7BSSWvEL, having examined the conviction and the statute, said, the conviction followed the words of tbe statute, and whatever they meant in the st&tute they meant in the conviction. The Court, therefore, saw -.o reason to differ from the opinion expressed by the Court of Exchequer.-Applicationrefused.

NEWV TPAL PAPER.
tACKB!Y v. mnnROO
Lulwa in Ramen.l
'.L'S was a rule to enter a verdict for the defendant in lieu of the conditional verdict which was taken for the plaintiff for 201. by consent at the trial before Mr. Serjeant Channell at the last WeDs assizes. It appeared that the defendant came to the house of the plaintiff one day to sell or deliver some coals, which he conveyed in a cart drawn by a mare. The plaintiff as soon as he saw the animal was attracted by her, and said to the defendant, "That is a tid mare you've got there, where did you get her, and whose is she?" to which the defendant replied, " Yes, she is. She is mine. I bought ber yesterday at Lea's repository at Bristol." After this the plaintiff wishing to " deal" for the mare, invited the coal merchant, who was a respectably connected man, to dinner, when the plaintiff bought the mare for 201., the defendant asserting that he had given 161. for her. It was proved, however, that the defendant had bought the mare for 91. only, and that from a man who had stolen her just before, though the defendant was ignorant of that fact. Under these circumstances, the pre-ent action was brought to recover the value of the mare, the declaration alleging that in the sale the defendant had warranted that he had a good title to her. At the close of the case the defendanVs counsel submitted tha' there was no evidence of any express warranty, and that as there was no implied warranty at law in such a sale the plaintifflought to be nonsuited. The leaxned serjeant was of that opunion, but it was arranged that a verdict should be taken for the plaintiff subject to this motion.
Mr. Serjeant KE1NGL&KB now showed cause against the rule, which raised two questions ;-first, was there any vwarranty of title Implied -by law on the part of the vendor under these circumstances ? And, secondly, if not, was there evidence of an express warranty in this case which ought to have been left to the jury, in which case, no doubt, the verdict would have been for the plaintiff? The learned serjeant then entered into a learned argument to show that the rule caveat emptor did apply here, and that the law did imply a warranty of good title-citing fully Story on Sales, second edition, whtere all the eases on the point are collected under the head "Warranty," and referin reclarly to the case of "1Morley v. Attenborouagh" (Erk e.
500), where this Court held that there was n(owarrantyof title on the sale of a pledge by a pawnbroker. Such a warranty would entitle the plaintiff to retain his verdict
Mr. M. SNiTr, with whom was Mr. T. W. Saunders, for the defendant, submitted that the conversation on wbich the plaintiff relied for his express warranty had nothing to do with the sale of the mare, but was a mere casunal talk about her, and did not amount at the beat to anything like a direct afmimation that the horse was the property of defendant in the sense that he knew it was not stolen. As to the legal question, he was prepared to contend that no warranty was implied by the law of Englandbut he was interrupted by
The CHEF BARoN, who said that, for the purpose of discussing the first point, it might be assumed in the strongest and broadest terms that the law did not raise any such implication. The first question depended on the meaning which was to be placed on the words used by the defendant, and that was for a jury, not the Court or a judge, to decide. The learned serjeant had reported that he held there was no evidence to go to the ury of any warant ; but the language used
bythe defendantdidI In anne sense at least import an assertion of title in himself, for he said the mare wam his, and he had bought her and given 161. for her. There vwa therefore a question for the jury and, as he had clearly told a falsehood as to the price paid ty him to the thief, though he was ignorant of the fast that the mare had been atolen, there could be very little doubt which way the jury would have decided any question put to them. Itwaselear, therefore, that the Coiurt could not enter a verdict for the di.- fendant, or a nonsut - and, as to sending the case down for a new trial, that ought not to be done, as the defendant had rested his chance upon the objection, and had not not oneto he uryw'hen he had the opportunity of so doing intherst instance.iHe thought, therefore, the
Mr. aro MA.yneentirely concurred. Every thing which passed by parolwas forthe jury, and there could be no ob st h a in -which the jury would have decided the question of warranty or no warranty. As to the other point, he had looked into the Law very closely when
orley v. A.ttenborongh" was before the Court, and he thought that its policy was well and correctly exemplified

iums was an actlon brought by the steamship Empress Eugenie against the Norwegian bark Alfen, to obtain compensation for salvage services rendered to her near to Larmpsake Bay, in Asia, on the 11th of January, 166. The barke, coal-laden, had been driven on a shoal in consequence of the tempestuous state of the weather. The steamer went to her aid, and succeeded in tuggng her off. On the part of the owners it was eontended that the services were of a very sligt nature. The value of the property salved was 1,634f.

This was a suit brought by the schooner Scout against the ship Gibson Craig to procure a salvage reward for services rendered to her in the neighbourhood of the Azores on the Oih of January, 1856. The weather was exceedingly boisterous, and the Gibson Craig, bound from Calceutta for London, had sustained considerable damage. After a long and laborious service the schooner succeeded in conducting her to Fayal. The value of the property salved was 22,6341.
Atender was made of 6001., the sum alleged to have been stipulated for between the masters of the two vessels. The owners did nodtdeny that a moat meritorious se-vice had

COURT OF BANKRUPTCY. Bain7hal3l-trce, Jaiz. 22.
MIlT 11}4 X. .X - A
(Before Mr. Commi,sioner FOLROYI7.1
A petition came before the Court in respect to the right of Mr. Rolt, M.P., and the Commercial Bank, as the mortgagees of certain property. It appeared that Mr. Rolt had
urchased the Black-wall property from the assignees of the tankrpt for a sum of 55,000., and it was desirable te effect the transfer as early as mightbe practicable. The proceedings presented no feature of public interest.
The Co03rAssIo'NI inquired the position of the bankrupt's estates in respect to assets and dividend?
Mr. Lee (official manager) said that in the course of a few Weeks it was anticipated that the assets in hand would amount to 50,0001. or 60,0001., and which would be divided.
Mr. LiWRANcz said, the assignees had been subjected to a series of adverse circumstances. These included the position of the contracts for Government. The peace had not been without its influence. To complete contracts with the required despatch, it had been necessary to eng e workmen from all parts and to keep them employed nigMt and day. From 31. to 41. per week had thus been paid to workmen whose wages under ordinary circnmstances would not have exceeded 30s. or 40s. It was felt that Government ought not to sabject contractors to losses occasioned by Government itself, and a memorial had been presented on the subject.
An adjournment was then ordered.
Mr. Fonblanque, son of the learned Commissioner, after being at the Court some time yesterday, discovered that his pocketbook, containing banknotes (payment of which has been stopped) and a Crystal Palace season ticket, was missing from his person. It can be no insinuation against the purity of justice to hazard a conjecture that in the event of the lucky finder returning it to its owner he may very probably receive a first-class certificate for honesty.

;MASSI0J-H[OUSE.-Henry Willham Scott, cashier to Mlessrs. Yeats, Acocks, and Co., Old Fish-street, provision merchants, was brought before the Lord Mayor upon the charge of having embezzled 2501., the property of that
Mr. J. D. Copeman, a partner in the house of Yeats, AcocTks, and Co., said,-On Monday last I attended this court to ve evidence against a traveller of ours who was committedto prison for trial on a charge of embezzlement. In that case the prisoner was a witness for the prosecution. In consequence of a communication which I received I examined our cashbook and ledger, and on examining the ledger I found that various sums of money were entered to the credit of several customers whose names had not been entered in the cashbook. The cashbook was kept by the prisoner, whose duty it was to enter the amaounts he received, and it was the duty oE the ledger clerk to enter the sums in the ledger. It was also the prisoner's duty to ;a the money to the banakers each day, and to make the
aiance in his cashbook agree with the payments to the bankers. On examining our ledger I found items credited to several customers in the prisoner's handwriting. That was an irregular proceeding, and I spole to the prisoner upon the subject. I reforred to Bufn's account, and desired an explanation. I asked him what he had done with the 33O.Os. 2d. Ho said, " I took it." I then said to him, "Is there anything else you have taken ' He said, " Yes, but are you going to give me in charge?" I said, " You are here to answer my questions, and not I to answer yours." I said, " Let us go through the ledger together, and point out to me the cases where you have taken our money." He did so, and pointed out iu additioa to Mr. Barn's account sams received from several other customers. I have since discovered a further sum. I have since examined my cashbook with respeot to the items and the dates on which they appear to be entered in the ledger, but there is no entry in the cashbook to correspond with those payments.
The prisoner was remanded.
The prisoner's felow-clerk, whose name is Samuel Hardcastle, was committed to Newgate on Wednesday fer trial for embezzlig 781. and other sums, the property of the firm, which had not been handed over to the cashier.
Villiam Sayers, a lad who appeared to be about 15 years of age, was charged with forgery.
Mr. Mullens appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Wontner for the prisoner.
Mr. W. S. Flinders, cashier to Messrs. Smith, Payne, and Smith, bankers, said,-Mr. E. W. Bourne keeps an account at our house. About 12 o'clock on Tuesday the prisoner presented to me the check produced for 301., purportin to be signed by M1r. Bourne. Ftrom information which Iha received he was detained at the house, and afterwards taken away. The check for 101., also produced, was paid by me on the 12th of January, and was returned by Mir. Bourne to us as forged. The three other checks, also purporting to be drawn by Mr. Bourne, for 201., 101., and 10., are marked as having been paid by our house.
Mr. .NW. Bourne, of 5, Carey-lane, near the General Post-ofrice, warehouseman, said,-The prisoner was in my employment about a year, and was in the same employment up to the time at which he was given in charge. The check for 30L is not in my handwriting, nor was it signed by my authority. The signatures to the other four checks pro. duced are all forgeries. The number upon each check is 17,280, which is the same number as my checkbook, and these checks have been taken out of my checkbook. I keep my checkbook in my deck locked up, and one morning, about sihweeksago,I found that my deskwasunlocked, but whether I unintentionally left it so or not I can't say. I am acquainted with the prisoxer's handwriting, and I beheve the filling up of these five checks, or certainly some part of each of them, to be his handwriting.
Cross-examined by Mr. Wontner.-I have four persons in my employment. I believe all the checks to be in the prisoner's handwriting, but I cannot speak so clearly as to the signatures as I can as to the other parts, but I believe the signatures are also in his handwriting.
Thain (detective officer) said,-I took the prisoner into custody on Tuesday afternoon. He was asked in my presence by Mr. Mullens's clerk how he accounted for the possession of the 301. check. He said he declined saying. I searched him, and found in his Pockets six cigars in a cigar case, three rings. ll. 12s. 8d. in money, some keys, &c.

*MALRYLEI3ONE.ThO Magistrates of this court have received a letter from Mr. Ph'illips, of the Coal-Eschange, to
the effect that there was at their disposal, through the kindness of Lord Ward, five tons of coals, being a tenth part of 50 tons which his Lordship had directed to be dealt out to deserving persons in the district, each person, after inquiry being duly made and being considered worthy of particlpating in the donation, to be the recipient of two sacks. The coals are at the Camden station of the London and North-Western Railwav, and Mr. Phillips has generously undertaken to deliver at his own expenso the ceals at the dwellings of the parties who may be considered entitled to participate in the kind gift of the nobleman abovenamed.
WORSHIP-STREET,-The magistrate intimated his receipt of the following contributions, the donors of which requested an acknowledgment in this paper:-The Leathersellers' Company, 10l.; "I Mrs. E. G.," 1 ; " B.," in stamps, lOs.; " H.G.

L1AuE1nTH.-Edwin Astley, formerly a guard on the Eastern Counties Railway, appeared before the Hon. G. C. NORTON to answer to a summons taken out agaist him by Inspector Bent, of the South-Western Railway, charging him with travelling on that line from Godalming to London without taking a ticket, and intending to avoid pa'ment.
From the evidence it appeared that on the 30th of last month the defendant presented himself at the station at Godalming, and asked to seethestation-master. Mr. Hillier the station-master, came forward, and he (the defendant), without the slghtest ceremony, appealed to him for a pass to town. Mr. Hillier told him he had no power to grant him one, and it was as much as his situation was worth to do so. The defendant then told him that he was a guard on the Bastern Counties line, but was about to leave in consequence of a reduction in the staff of guards, but had the option given to him by the company to go back to his former situation, that of a porter. This, however, he did not wish to do, and had been down the country to apply for the situation of relieving officer. He also expressed his great anxiety to get back to town, and Mr. Hillier, believing that he was what he represented himself to be-a guard on the Eastern Counties Railway-allowed him to get into one of the carriages on his solemn promise that he would pay the fare on reaching town. It should be stated that in confirmation of his statement the defendant unbuttoned his mackintosh coat and displayed one of the regular uniform coats worn by the guards on the Eastern Counties. On reaching the Waterloo station the ticket collector took the defendant before Mr. Norman, the principal inspector, and to that officer the defendant agaiu represented that he was a guard on the Eastern counties Railway, and was allowed to go away on leaving his name and address, which he gave as at the Shoreditch station, Slhoreditch. By desire of Inspector Bent he also gave his grivate address. Several days having passed over, and the aefendant taking no notice of the matter, Mr. Young, the station manager, directed Mr. Bent to call on him and get the fare. On calling at Shoreditch station Mr. Bent found that the defendant had left the service of the Eastern Counties Railway on the 19th of November, and that therefore his representations to the officers on the South-Western were f2lse. He next went to his lodgings, and left word with his wife that, unless he paid the Ss. fare within a day or two, a summons would be taken out against him. He took no notice of the matter, and Mr. Young, feeling in the first instance that the defendant had practised a deceit on tho officers of the South-Western, and in the next that it was his intention to defraud the company, directed a summons to be taken out.
The defendant, whose manner was exceedingly flippant, finding the case clearly proved against him, admitted he owed the money, but was unable to pay it.
Mr. Bent here remarked that the whole affair arose through the improper practice, as he conceived, of allowing officers not actually in the service of the company to wear the livery clothes, The defendant, his worship would perceive, stul wore the uniform coat of the Eastern Counties Railway Company, though he had ceased to be a servant of the company for several weeks. This practice hebelieved to be so improper that he had written to Mr. Larder, the inspector of the Eastern Counties Railway, to be in attendance that day to give some explanation on the subject, but he had not condescended to take the slightest notice of his letter.
Mr. NORTON conceived the practice complained of by Mfr. Bent to be most objectionable, and thought it should not be allowed. The defendant had5 in his opinion, misled the officers of the South-Western Railway Company by stating that he was at that time a guard on the Eastern Counties Railway, and it was his belief also that his object was to defraud them of the fare. He then convicted him in a penalty of 20s. in addition to the 5s. fare, and 2s. costs.

Shameful Deception Of An Old Lady.
SHAMEFUL DECEPTION OF AN OLD LADY. ,
(From the Globce)
Our good contemporary, the Morning Hcrald, -gives us the following information -
" A Cabinet Council was held yesterday. The delibera-
tiobs oI the right hon. party 'neted for a considerable time I *e hemve good reason tor statis%g that the chief subject of discustnsi was . secnstruen*u of the Government.
" We shall 4tate the facts as we believe them to be withut sany comsoTntt--comnetntary we leave to our readers.
"irs for onother coalition were made more than a moan'th ago. f COUIY6 ' coalition' means a junction of any existig 'o mnerst with the 'lPeelites,' commonly and properly so called.
" ;Lord Aberdees, Sir James Graham, and Mr. Gladstone hra've consequently 'uad the necessary meetings at Mr. Sidney fferbert's mansionl.
"Lord Aberdeen has had interviews with Lord Palmerston twice wit'in the last three days.
" There is little doubt that Sir Charles Wood will retire from the Admiralty.
"I There is little doubt also that Sir James Graham will retum to office, but why not to his old and 'first loved' pest, the Admiralty, we cannot inmagine.
" We understand that Sir George Grey wiUl take thc offlce 'of the late First Lord, and that Sir James wi-ll reassume in his place one of his vaTious other previous pots.
" It is further said that the Chanoellor of the Exchequer will be replaced by Mr. Gladstone, whose great Cozsp will ie another promise of a reduction of the income-tax.
" Among the minor changes it is stated that Sir Robert -eel will resign his Lordship of the Admiralty."
We all recollect the admirable little sketch in which Mr. Leech pictorially demonstrates how a rude boy, by simply shouting "IiE" in a sharp and impressive manner to a respectable elderly lady at a crossing, can induce her instantly to believe that a concentration of cabs, omnibases, and runaway horses is close upon her, and how thermomentary hypothesis causes her to exhibit much extrava. gance of manner and gesture. We fear that some rude boy has been shouting " Hi !" to our very much respected contemporary the Hcavld, and has sacceeded in making him imagine the extravagant statements we have quoted.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMEBS.
Sir,-The public are so much indebted to you, who, through your world-wide circulating paper, are always ready to render assistance when required, that you wil, I am sure, devote a small space to a matter of no little conse. quence,'as you will perceive, both toEngland and Canada. In your last nmnber an account is given of a meeting held ix London at which 800 workmen were present, and it was then stated that one-fourth of the workinen of the metropolis were out of employment. The object of this large mneeting was to call the attention of the Government to this deplorable state of things.
Now, Sir, I have resided for many years in Western Canada, and can therefore speak from my own knowledge on this subject. In that part of Canada tho men who held this meeting would find full employment and good wages. When I left Canada last October it was very difficult to hire either carpenters or bricklayers, so great was the demand; the wages paid to such men were from 8s. to 10s. per diem, sterling, and for very indifferent hands, to work in a garden, 4s. sterling per day and board.
Now, why should these men in London, and no doubt thousands more in the country towns, be al,ncst, with their families, reduced to starvation, when we in Canada would be glad to receive them?
J am sure if you would take up the subject of emigration to Canada, you would confer upon the poor mechanic of England a substantial boon, and benefits of a lasting nature to Canada.
The Government of England should at once organize a plan whereby some system can be adopted for rendering pecuniary assistance and local information aboub Canada to the class of people I have been speaking about. -
The carrying out of some plan under proper management would be of the greatest benefit, and one that we in Canada, where there is such a lacl of servants, both male and female, would be most happy to see adopted.
Now that the Imperial Parliament is about to meet, pray, Sir, give your powerful assistance in bringinig the matter before the Government and the public.
Excuse this lengthy intrusion on your most valuable time and space, and allow me to subscribe myself
Your verv obedient servant

Baron Alderson is lying in an almost hopeless
Baron Alderson is lying in an almost hopeless state at his residence in Park-crescent, Regent's Park. The learned judge was in the first instance attacked with detersnination of blood to the head, and since that time he has had an attack of paralysis, which has affected his lower extremities. Baron Alderson was appointed vacation judge, but it has now been arranged that ar. Justice Coleridge shall take that duty, and Mr. Ser. jeant Channell will be placed on the commission for the Mqome Circuit at the forthcoming assizes in the place of Mr. Justice Coleridge. Ia the event of Baron Alderson's recovery he will retire from the bench on his pension of Z;. :00. a-year, to which he is entitled for upwards of 16 years' service.-GloAc.
CAN WE IeOLD AFFGHAa-ISTAN ?-Ilerat has fallen. Sir John Lawrence is to meet Dost Mahoined in the Khyber. Ten thousand men have been demanded from Bengal to join the Persian expedition. The Czar has seized Astrabad as a material guarantee for the security of Persia. The Persians have collected 20,000 men to resist the landing of the expedition. The treasuries of the north-west have been drained to satisfy the cravings of our new ally. The Ameer's srns have seceded to the Shah. Such are some of the facts and rumours in rapid circulation throughout India. The first three are probably correct, and even those most palpably absurd are not without an inmportance of their own. They indicate the instinctive sense which the public entertains of the gravity of the situation. We are drifting fast into the shoreless sea of Central Asian politics. The cycle has come round onee more. We are embarked for the second time in an undertaking from which we must not again retreat without thecertainty of permanent success. Of that undertaking the invasion of Persia is bat one import. ant section. Are the gates of India to be English or Russian7 Is the Tartar cradle to be rocked from London or St.Petersburg? That is the question which under pretty disguises seem to be presented to the Government of India. £oliticians acknowledge that with the annexation of the thanjab the main difficulty has disappeared. Soldiers allow that the valley of the Indus is now a safe base of operations, that Cabul is but five days' march frons our strongest camp. The public has lost its -dread of the mountain clans. It appreciates the lesson taught by Sir John Lawrence, and knows that, like other wild beasts, they can be tamned by hunger and the occasional application of the whip. Yet, in spite of all this, there is an undefined f-eling that Affghanistan would be a dangerous and expensive possession. W'hy I The population is not brav er than that of the IIuzara. It is scarcely so nuimerous as that of Onde. It is not so fanatic as that of Mlalabar. There is no natural difficulty in Aff. glianistan which does not equally exist in Kohat. There is ,no want of experience on ourside. Thereare20 officers now on the frontier who, if -ordered to hold Affghanistan, would know thorougbly what to say and howv to act, how to con. ciliate the chiefs, and how to emnploy a half-starving population. The mere danger, -indeed. scarcely deserves discus-sion. But at what expense would the ocoupation be maia. tained ? The injury to the revenue is at least clear. W0e venture with profonnd submission to question eveni that assertion. Is it cheaper to guard the plain against the mountain, or the snountain against the pLai ? %We must do one or the other. If -not, if Russia is not advancing, if there is no danger approachinr, we have no business beyond the range, or in Persia. We are senidiug a costly expedition to hunt a will-o'-the wisp. Bat if, as we believe, and as our actions prove, there is real danger, the cheapest method of defence is to garrison the natural fo-tress. It would be cheap even it we turned the Affghans into -our most faithful subjects by formaUy exempting them- from all taxation. Half the army now coiled up in thePunjab would turn Affghanistan into an inpregnable fortress. Every rock and mouitttain, now a terror, would then be a defence. Every Kihan of the steppe, now half inclined to join the invader and sbare the spoils, would take heart to.continue a contest of wvhich we reap the fruit .withovt the cost. With the fortrews in our hands, and its approaches always exposed to a fliak attack from Bushire
the peninsula would be absolutely safe. That -auietude is ,not, even in the point of view assumed by financial officers, -a mean advantage. Let us not be inisunderstood. We ad-vocate no- insane plunge in1to the passes, without a reason .eor a dapger; we simply point to facts which, if the danger
.arrives, are. mocessarf to a ealm judgment on the appropriate remedy.-Friend of India.

TO THE EDITOR OF TEIE TIMES.
Sir,-In your admirable article on the Registrar-General's annial summary of the weekly return of births, deaths, and marriages for the past year, you truly say that in that report no particular mention is made of the south side of the river, and you conjecture from this fact that the south districts " stUl retain their unhealthy pre-eminence as the seat of fever and cholera:" AUow me to vindicate the cause of this once unhealthy locality by assuring you that your assumption is at variance with the true state of the case.
The accompanying small table wiU show that, by taking the whole of the districts on the south side of the Thames, the mortality is rot above the average. And, by comparing the entire mortality and deaths from zymotic or epidemic contagion of the largest district on the south side (Lambeth) with the three largest on the north side,-viz., Kensington, Marylebone, and Pancras-the favourable position of the former will be at once seen, which may, I think, in a measure be attrituted to the great improvement of the quality of the water -now supplied to the district. The figures in the table are oL.lained from the Registrar-General's pttblished reports,
I am, Sir, your obedient servant,

THE UNEAIPLOYED.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIME-3.
Sir,-I observe in Tlhe Timas that meetings of the unemployedabout London are being held. If they are ablebodied labourers, and wiling to work at trenching or drainage, they are the very men we want. For some years past the difficnlty of getting lands drained has been gradually on the increase, onving to the scarcity of men for the operation, and this season weo are in, many places at a standstill from the same cause. An ordinary workman makes with ease 2s. 6d. in the winter day, and if a. aU expert at drainage he oftener earns 3s. The most inexperienced, if able and wiUing, might rely on 2s. at least, and neither frost nor snow often interrupts the work.
On several estates under my management drainage to a large extent has been effected withlin the last five years, so I speak from experience, and though I am not concernedin that nndertakhng this season beyond a comparatively small extent I yet find much difficulty. I enclose a handbill for drainers, not one of whom, if good at the job, need earn less than from los. to 18s. per week at the rate per cbain
I enclose my card, but do not wish my name or the names in the handbill lnhliel-.A

Brigands In The Pope's Dominions.-The
BRP.I-ANDS IS THE POPE'S DOMINIONS.-The Giol nate di Roona contains the following :-" We have the satisfaction of announcing that the band of the notorious Lazzarini has been destroyed. It will be remembered that during the night of the 8th inst. the troop of the detachment of Predeppio, commanded by Andrea Tenesini, had returned towards Poggio, a vi'lage of Tuscany. This troop and that of the detachment of Mortano, commanded by
latteo Agostinelli, acted in accordance with information which they had received. At i o'clock or the norning of the 9th thegendarmes attacked the house of the farmer, Xicheli Leoni, at a place namied Casella, where they met with a violent resistance fro,n two assassins, Joseph Affliti, named Lazzarini, and Henri Cassadio, known as Pasottino. The valiant Tanesini, who was first in advance, was killed but the other officer succeeded in killing, at the first blow, one of the robbers, who was afterwards recognized as Pasottino. Lazzarini managed to take to flight, buttlhe troop was soon on his traces, and we have been informed that on the 11th he was arrested by the gendarmerie of the Grand Duke on the form of Pisello. While we deplore the death of Tancsini, we have much pleasure in stating that the chief of so mnischievous a band of robbers has fallen into the hands of justice."
AD E-(;LISIT INTx IoUE.-It is natural that the Russians should owe us a bit of a grudge for the manner in which our diplomacy, backed by our armaments, has given them a lesson of good faith. But the writers who affect the part of their organs, whether at St. Petersburg or Paris, should really write a little less like old women umaundering over weak tea. Take the following specimen of a "1 letter from St. Petersburg," which we have extracted from the Journ-al des Dlats :-" All the intrigues carried on by English agents with a view to ruin the important commercial relations wlhich the Russian merchants carry on with China through the town of Kisebta are well knowvn at St. Petersburg. It does not unfrequently happen that large quantities of tea of the finest qualities thus imported by land into Euscia are purchased by English houses and sent to London." There is a notable instance, on more or less authentic record, of an Irish attempt in " iNoinety Eiht," to ruin a certain bank by burning all its notes that cound be got hold of. Very similar in complexion would be an English " intrigue" to ruin the Russian trade with China hrough Eiaohta by buying large quantities of the imports .of that trade for the London market !-Globe.
lNAVAL OFxscrnia' FULL-PtY BIisS.-We believe it is contemplated to abolish the system of paying naval officers on fall pay by biMfs on thebAccountant-General, and that they will, As soon as the arrangements are comnplete, be paid in sterling by the paymasters of their several ships. It
as long been a great loss tosfficers on mnany foreign stations who have been compelled to .disconnt their bills. Even at home they are subjected to bar ers' charges. which, though comparatively trifling, are felt to be an additional tax upon a class not at all overpaid.-P412s-l1rh Mlail.
