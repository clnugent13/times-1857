I £gTHU LATE SIR GEORGE COCKBEU. TO THE EDITOR OETHE TaES. kir,-I trut you will permit me, as his son-in-law and on the part of those most deeply intereted in the bigh reputation of the late Admiral of the Flee% the BRiht Hon. Sir George Cockburn, to make some general observations on the very important debate that took place in the Commons House of Parliament, on the motion of Admiral Sir Charles Napier for " a select committee to inquire into the constitution of the Board of Admiralty, and which proceedings have been fally reported in your columns. Admiral Sir Charles Napier, while quoting freely the o pinions of Sir George Cockburn on the administration of the navy, a3 expressed in a- posthtmous document first published in the columns of TAe Timem, and while restng his entire aguments on the foroe of reasoning adduced by that distinguished o9i1cer, has thought himself Justified in commenting upon the fault he belieres him to bavecommitted in not eariUer giving-to the world-the reult lof bis deliberations, Sir Charles liapier eantirell losing sight of the fact that it is not to the expression of an opinion aloue, but to the just selection of an opportune time for that expression, that success in any great measure may mainly betraced. It is surely possible to be before as well-as behind the age, and he only wastes hig time and that of his hearers who advocates any particular line of policy in a period unripe for its reception. Whatever opinion the gallant Admiral, Sir Charles Napier, may entertain upon tbis subject, it is perfectly clear that Sir George Cockburn did not regard the matter in the same light; and in the opening paragraph of thke manuscript found 'with his wil he states, " I feel thatf my opinion may, sooner or later, be deemed worthy of consideration and atbention; I therefore am induced to place in writing the decision to which my experience has brought me onthis point." Now, Sir, as the manuscript is dated "1846," and as Sir George Cockburn lived in the full possession of his faculties until the day of his death In 1853 without giving publicity to his opinions, it is clear that he conoeived that the opportune time had not anrived. The writer of this letter was one of those earliest informed of the existence of the docn. ment, and felt that its appearance, even at that period, would still be prematue When, however, the whole country was awakened to the maladministration of pablia departments during the late war, and when Earl Grey iwas advocating the assimilating of the administration of the army to that of the nav, and was absolutely making pro. positions in the House of Lords to that effect, it was evident the proper moment had arrived; and thus, 18 months afterthe decea of the gallant offieer, the document was given to the public, and blew to the winds the illdis,ed schemes of the former Secretary of War. . The Earl of Malmesbury, while passing a high encomium on the charcter of the late distiguished Admiral of the Fbleet thus expresed himself, as regarded the motion of Earl Gey :-"' Mty impression and conviction are that, If sachtook place-if the adnistration of the patronage of the army were assimilated to that of the navy-it would be..come the same hotbed of jobbery and trickery which has been, unfortunately, for many years a reproach to the Admiralty;" and the noblo earl pledged himself as an opponant to any such maeasr. The Earl of 3Elenborough, than whom a more competent or experienoed judge could not be, and who had been him. self First Lord of the Admiralty while Sir George Cockburn wa in office, declared his opinion also to be in favour of a naval head, or commander-in-chle1 in that department. The country is detrmined to secure efficiency in the worldng of the naval and military departments, and, despite puerile argaments advanced in support of the retentilon of the Board of Admiraltr, as a Board, the common sense and spirit of the times will, at no disant period, carry this neoessary reform. Heretofore theAdmiralty has been the departnent uieiea initiate novices into political life, or the regeon into which a troublesome member of Parlia. ment might be thrust, in. the hope that the pleasing seductions of office might ,serre to keep sach restiff spirits obe- dient vamals to the Minister of the day, talent and real aptltude for busfuess beng deemed no necessary qualifications. : Mr. Bernal Osborne conceives that he has establshed an inconsIsteney on the part of the late Admiral of the Fleet by quoting from two speeches de]ivered by the gallant admiral in Parliament-the one in 820 and ihe other in 1825, advocating, it appas, at that period, the existing constitationof the board ;but surelythelapseof-21yeargTna jisatlfy a ohabg of opinion on this or on any other political subject. Why, half the great reforms whicl have been forced-apon the Minister of-the daywould never have been cmied into execution had not great changes of opinion passed over the publio mind. No individual can be charged with inconsistency who keeps pace with the increased information of the times, and acts on the experience acquired durlng 21 years of professional lIfe. Mr. Bernal Osborne might have been told, had Sir Chrles Napier been a more readydebater, thatithe positioninwhich Sir George Cockbern stood in such early period of his professional career did not justify him in advocating any such change. Being selected on his immediate entrance into office to hold the high and important post of ESIrst Naval Lord, and constantly receivinLg the unqualified support of his civil chief, not only were there probably no practical difficultiesthen at work to im. pede his free professional action, but how onerous would have been hls poaition had he enacted the cuckoo part of epideavouring to oust that friendly chief from his post; a,mere elfish vanity might have been gratified by attaini4g the position of commander-in-chief of the navy, but he b,ad not yet witnessed the injurious effects of the forma. tion of the board, nor found himself held responsible in the eyes of the world for measue he could not controL A A docament must be considered to be finished when containing all the views of the writer, or all those which he deems itto be judiciousto state, to lbmittihefleld ofdiscussion; and there is no doubt that the effect of the document in question has been such; and the time for its appearance so vell chosen, that it may be aserted with confidence that the day is not far distant when the principles which it advocates will be fully carried into execution. The public camnot be made to comprehend how it should so happen that a highly practical aud scientific profession should be presided over by a gentleman deficient in every single qualification necessary to justify bis appointment- to auch office; they cannot be made to undertnd what advan. tage can aocrue to the nation by displacing on every change of Administration gentlemen who have just become acqsnted with their multifarious duties; nor can they clearly perceive how the national interest can be cared for when it is notorious that members of. each successive Board of Admiralty have openly and fearlessly declared, despite the indecency of the assertion, that they will reward only those whose friends and relations are their poliiical supporters. Public indignation has been directed agaInst the purchase asd sale of commissions in the army, but its injurious effects are as nothing when compared -with the purchase of commissions in the navy through the instramentality of polltical Support. Mfr. B;ntinck in his speech in Parliament asks, " What would be said if any one were to propose to make a cvilian Commander-in-Chief of the army?" and he is at a loss to conceive how such an anomaly can exist in a far more difficult and scientifio profession. Tne answer is simple elaough :-The ar-my as a body possess far more political influence than the navy, and therefore have power to deter any Minister foniplacing any such incompetent individual at their head. 'It has been already remarked that the publication of the late Admiral of the Fleet's valuble document elicidted from tie Earl of Ellenborough, in his pl i Parliament, an ex. pession of opinion in full OncurrenCe. with Sir Georgeqockbern's on the propriety of placing a naval officer at the head of the Boad of Admiralty.

Weproceeded onwan about 30 mileshigher up than Medina, and not one of the. villages marked on the map as existing on the right lank ofi the river in 18368remains with the exception of a few 2eewi huts belonging to the Haddadlybn, opposite the grouna ot rather marsh oocupied by theBeni Sedd. So far, however,; we -got on verywell,-andreslized the soundings as given br Chesey. A little lfurther on the ziver graduly shoaled,' and inaspace of four miles 6w redioced in deptlifronl three fathomzsToc thzee feet. Hereve stuck fastinbte mnua and with difficlty turned the steamer (which the chazmel barely admitted), and, after several attempts to discoverdeeper water, were relucUntly oblged to ret . The& aative pilots ana others hd fozewarned us that such wola. be the result, but we determined to try, and were unfor. ately a nsuyu esfuL The whole *ountry hereabouts is. literally underwater for miles and miles onboth sides, a small low islet here and there covered with gree rshee. being the only visible sig of exisng land. Even the midtr dling-sized bitumen boats, we wren told, are obliged t transfer their cargoes into canoes, in order to their beIng rasported over these shallows, which extend to within 1- miles of Sook-Esh-Shyiookh, and,beginning again a litLi. above that town, continue as high -up a Diwaniyeh, takin_ inthe lamloommarshes. From all aounts colleoted o the spot it seems pretty certain that the old channel of thea Euphrates has been destroyed, and the river now disechrgee an immense volume of water over the surrounding country. So much, inaeed, is this the case that the nearest actuat route at this seson to Beara or Zebir from the norhwart is through the flooding which extend to those plaes from about Beni Sedd,wbich in some iarts are sid to be fromt two to three fathoms in depth. I have it, mreover, on reliable authority that the eld chwnnel of the Eulprate ftom Diwahlych to Sook-Esh-Shyiookh is also unnaw vigable except for very small boats, the larger craft being obliged to resort to a deeper and more modern off. shootontheleftbank; but even theremuch difficulltyi experiencedin traekiln and poling them to Sook. .A t has taken place since Chesney's survey, and is to bo attzie buted to ths destructionof the bunds or embankments,' which served to confine the river in one deep chnel, x. cept when swollenby the heavy rains and the melting of the snow on the Taurus. Such is ihe report of the Arabs, -whoinformed me that these distr.cts, now converted into a vast swamp, were, five years ago, under cultivation, and yieldeL. wheat, barley, and rice in abundance. Noihing, however, can ba more wretched than the present existence of thes'wild iiver tribes, who have nothing to boast of but theindependence which the country they inhabit teads to givethem. Their huts aund the mats which cover them, ars made exclusivelyof reeds cuts from the adjoining swampsand the floors are covered with the same material, a new layer of reeds being added as the river rises. Even atthls season it was impracticable to go from one house to another in any of the encampments without wading ancle deep in mud; and such anr the general featmres of the surrounding_ dead-level country as far as the eye can rech. The above facts may be imporuant in connexion with the. proposed " -uphratesValleyallayCo-pan.,-'andIsenS them for publication in order that those interesed in that project may take measures to ascertain the practicbilty o extending their operations to this quarter while it contlnueqin its present condition. It is reported, indeed, that the Turkish Goverment havesome idea of restoring the embankments, and thxt they are treating with Montefik Sheikh to undertake the work, offr. ing payment for the same by remitting part of the anug revenue payable by that cbief. Even should such an arrangement be made there Is little chance of it being: executed. The marshes and swamps serve to keep the Arab4 independent of Turkish control, and they will not boe in a hburry to do anything whih- may brig them more easly within the reach of their present nominal rulers :I may mention that-a report is current among the AbiaW on the river that thePorte,has pawned this district to th English. The " Euphrates Railwa;" project has doubtlesPgivex rise to this rumour; but the people, neverthelee seemed anxious to believe it to be true. The Bedooeen in the interior are represented as beiDn lessfavorblyin towards us, and cahe a great dreE lest by our eeming among them their lawless freedom should soon be at an end Yours. &t..

DTONY.MABKBTanWozTyINTELLI6RWCB.~ Wednesday Evening Ile funds opened this morning without anima. tion at the clobing quotations of Yesterday and c3ubsequently experienced a decline of an eighth, the nnarket closng with an appearance of great dulness 9he first transactions in Consols for money were at -93i to 94, and after some slight fluctuations they zeceded to 93- to i, at which they remained to the .official close. After regular hours there were sellers -nt 93j for money, and at 941 (or 92i ex dividend) -for tha July account. During the day it becme mnanifest, in connexion with the settlement which <Dccurs to-morrow, that the speculators have again purchased more stock than they are prepared to ¶bke, and the pressure for money thus occauioned, together with further unsatisfactory ac-ounts of the condition of business in Paris, lZended to produce a general want of confidence. Rank Stock left off at 212i to 214; Reduced, 12 to r; New Three per Cents., 92k to i ; India :EStock, 22 to 223 ; India Bonds, Bs. to 4s. dis-count; Exchequer Bonds, 98f to J; and Exche*quer-bills, June, 2s. dis. to 2s. pm. ; March, 2s. to -fi. pm. In the Stock-Exchange to-day the rate for ad.vances on Government securities was fully up to the hank minimum-C6 per cent. In the dliscountunarket and at the Eank the demand was extremely ~active. The payments falling due to-morrow, the -4th, are not particularly heavy, but there is an unmzsual amount to be met on thefollowing day,-since, from the fact of the let of Febrtsary and the 1st of March last having faUlen on Sundays, all the three .and four months' bills now maturing are thrown to -the 5th instead of the 4tb. Foreign securities were rather heavy, and primes iowards the close of business showed a decline. In 'Turkish Four per Cents. the transactions for tho -account were at 94k; the Four per Cents. Guarasiteed for money were negotiated at 101A and s, and for the account at 101i. The general operations included-Brazilian Five per Cents., 100; the Five ,per Cents., 1829 and 1839, 1OO; New Granada Active, 23- Mexican for money, 22k; for the *account, 22i and 23; kussian Four-and-a-Half per -Centm, Small, 98i; Sardinian Five per Cents., -S8^; the New Deferred, for account, 25g; and MDutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 97.2 The corn-market was steady this morning at the -rates of Monday. The final prices of the Frenach Three per Cents. .on the Paris Bourse this evening were 68f. 65c. for maoney, and 69f. for the end of the month, Bhowing -s further fall of three-eighths per cent. This is the lowest point touched during the last five weeks. The Sydenham has arrived from Port Phillip with :31,4G2 ounces of gold, valued at 125,8001. The 193,0001. announced yesterday by the Morning Star 3ha reached London. A portion will be purchased --ior the Bank of France, and the remainder is ex.pected to be taken to the Bank of England. The precise amount of the specie shipped by the Peninsular and Oriental steamer Indus is 761,6131.i of which413,4621. is silver forBombay, Madras, Calcutta, Penang, and Singapore, and 342,8371. for '3EIongkong and Shanghai. The only eold is 5,3141., f or Ceylon, Madns, and Hongkong. It is stated {hat the total w ould have reached the sUmI mentioned yesterday, but that there were numerous -packages which could not be prepared in time. '.he amount by the next mail will be proportion.ately increased. The London silk-market is maintained with firmAaess, and from this fact, coupled with the des-pondency on the Paris Bourse, it is to be inferred that the prospects of the French crop are not becoming less unfavourable. The suspension has been announced of Messs. William Macintosh and Co., of Manchester, 'With liabilities supposed to amount to about 100,0001., of which about 40,0001. fall on London. Telegraphic advices from Lisbon to-day state that the contract for the railway between Lisbon and Oporto lately entered into with Sir Morton Peto has been definitively approved by the Legislature, the measure having yesterday passed the Chamber of Peers. An arrangement has aLso been made for a settlement of the claims of Messrs. Shaw and Waring in connexion with the works already constructed on the portion of the line between Lisbon a*nd Santarem. The Committee of SpanishAmerican Bondholders have transmitted for publication a correspondence regarding the debt of Venezuela. It consists of a letter fronm the Finance Minister to Mr. Mocatta, the representative of the bondholders at Caraccas, ..and of Mr. Mocatta's reply thereto. The Finance Minister announces that the Venezuelan Government decline to assent to the agreement effected last JanuarT by their own commisioners with the bondholders committee in London, on the plea that the resources of the country would preclude the possibility of its being punctually fulfilled. He adds that the Government intend to issue a decree for the settlement of the debt according to their own views, and that this decree will be submitted along with the rejected agreement to the Venezuelan Congress, who can then decide between the two plans, or asuggest any other they may think proper. lr. Mocatta, in reply to this disgraceful intimation, formally protests against the right assumed by the Government of settling by an arbitrary decree the -claims of foreign creditors. It is understood that Sir Laurence Peel, who was anay years Chief Justice at Calcultta, is about to be nominated by the Government to the vacant seat in the East Incdia Direction. At a meeting of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Company, held to-day, Sir J. Matheson, IM.P., in the chair, a dividend, including the distribution on the new shares, equal to 5 per cent. for the half-year, free of income-tax, was declared, and the report was unanimously adopted. The whole 'of the discussion was of a satisfactory cbaracter, the *explanations 'with regard to the operation of the depreciation and insurance funds receiving the approval of the shareholders. Annexed is an abstract -of the report :, My 80. n Lnon, 'Ita of "The Madrid, unfortunately wrecked on the 21st of Febi nary last, by striking on a sunken rock at the entrance to the harbour of Vigo, was an iron vessel of 500 ton, built in 1845, at a cost of 17,0001. ; and this has been reduced, by the operation of the percentages set aside 2nnually for depreciation and insurance, to so small a sum that the loss of this vessel will not materially affect the proprietors' underwriting acmount at the end of the year. 'he company have purchased the Ottawa, a screw steamer eof 1,1(0 tons, and 200 horse-power, built two years ago for the Canada trade, but afterwards ernployed in the transport service in the Black Sea. The adaptation of her cabirs and fittirgs being now completed, she will leave for India on the 6th proximo. Two vessels contracted for are the Ceylon, of 2,380 tons, and 450-horse power; and the Granada, of 600 tons, and 150-horse power. The Delhi will Qbe launched in abouta montb, and ready for sea in Septeinber ; and the Candia, which has been lengthened 30 feet asnid&hips-an alteration which wilt greatly increase her passenger and cargo capacity-will also be ready for sea in about two months. These two vessels will fornu an important -addition to the oompany's available fleet, and the directors are making doe provision in other respects to meet fully the increasing traffic on the India and China lines. In their last report the directors referred to the despatch of the Alm Aden, Ava, nnd Azoff to the India and China stations, and they have now the satisfaotion to annonnce that the three first-Lamed vesEels reached their respective destinations in safety, and are in active service. The Azoff, on her arrival at Mauritius, vwas chartered by the contraotors for the mail sexvice between that place and Aden, and is now running on that line, which is already becoming of importance in bringing additional traffic into the company's main lines at Aden. "The Precursor, Pottinger, and Chusan were stated in -+he lat report to have been engaged by the Indian Govern- ment as transports for the purpoeses of the expedition to the Persian C-nut, then preparing. Since that time tho Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy, the Hadington (sailingahip), and the 'Oriental have also been chartered and employed in opera. tions connected with the Persian war. The scrvices of the 33entinck, Aden, and Bombay have likewise been temporarily availed of for the conveyance of troops and de. spatches; and it affords the directors satisfaction to state -that the mail service has suffered no interruption in con- sequence of these extensive demands on the company's re. sources. The intention of the direotors to establish a semi-monthly line between Bombay, the Straits, Hong. kong, ad Shanghai 'was announced in the last re- port. The arrangements wvere comupleted early in the spring, and the second line was opened in correspondence with the steamer w bich left Southampton on the 20th of March. Tbe state of affairs in China makes the re-'otablishment of a fortnightly communication with that -country a matter of much publio importance, and the directors trust the result of the working of this commorcial .ine may be such as to enable them to continue it throughout the year. The issue of new shares has been sucessfully -completed, and the directors bave redeemed a pledge given to the proprietors in the half-yearly report of May, 1855.maiaely, that the balano of new shares remaining on hand after the allotment at par of the 20,000 now shares created in the early part of that year, should ' be dealt with -or the general benefit of the company.' The rsidue 'of these shares on tho 1st of January last was 5,764; and the option of taking them up with 101. paid at 31. jpreminju was freely responded to bythe shareholders, shc total amount applled ior on thoe- terms being 10,420. ham avatlable nap l,er da thereforeappfortioned rateably m g th e a p p l nt s , a d a f ci o n o f p o n l y 0 6 n o w m main;~eadat o the eplis ofpro netraq in ludia4 17~0~1, iv~a ib a iwl1 jAJzd th§ directors propose to add thereto a. sufficient amount from the generaN earnings of the half-sear to admit of the pay. nment of 15s. on every paid-up or 60I. share, and 3s. on every newv or 101. share, mn addition to the dividend hereafter recomnmended; this course will, give every individual of thG proprieta.n a due proportion of the benefit arising from the isposal of the 5,764 shares referred to, while the company are placed in the advantageous position oE having the vho'e 20,000 new shares duly entered on the share register,iith 101. yaid. Tbe directors bave satisfaction in stating that up to tbe date of this report the operations of the current year have been successful * they therefore recommend thtt a dividend at the rate of 3A per cent. be nowv declared for the halt-year ending the 31st of March last, making, w ith the payment above referred to, 5 per cent, ona the share capital, cleatr of income-tax."i The first general meeting of the Lombamdo-Venetian Railway was held at Vienna on the 30th of May. The Duo de Galliera presided, andtheFrench and English directors were represented by Mess. Blount, Talabot, Laing, and De la Rosiere. iThe report, which was unanimously adopted, stated that the length of railway i work at the end of 1856 wras 402 kilometres, consisting of isolated sections, interrupted by breaks in the communication between Mian and Venice, Venice and Trieste, and Milan and the Piedmontese frontier. Active measurer are in progress to complete these portions, and, owing to an arrangement by vhich the line from Treviglio has been substituted for that originally proposed bythe Government from Monza to Berganmo, the most important communication-viz., that between Milan and Venice-will be completed in the autumn of the present year The goods traffic, which has hitherto been insignificant, will then receive a great development. Meanwhile the progressa in the passenger traffic has been most satisfactory. The 402 kilometres of State railway were worked by the State on account oi the company from the 1st of June to the Ist of October, 1856, and came into the possession of the companr only for the last three months of- 1856. In thi sbort timeit was impossible to organize any improvements, especially as the rolling stock handed over waa in bad order and insufficient, Nevertheless, the receipts of the seven months amounted to 3 99,400LI being an increase of 27 per cent. over the corresponding period of the preceding year. The working expenses for the same period amounted to 114,000W1 being at the rate of 57i per cent. of the gross receipts, and leaving a net profit of 85,8001. The amount of capital paid. up at the end of the year was 2,312,5001.-viz., 61. a-share o4 the 312,500 shares of the company and a first instalment of 21. 16B. on each of 156,250 obligations; out of this capital the first instalment of 680,0001. to the Austrian Government has been paid, and also 273,6001. on account of the Central Italian Railway, in accordance with the concesson. The expenditure on works in progress to the end eo theyear had been n,5001. The interest at5per cenb on the capital paid up for si months after deductint the interest earned on inveshment of surplus funds amounted to 52,7001. By the statutes of the cosm. pany the whole of this might have been charged to capital during the construction of the works; but the dir-ectors recommnended that the interest on so much oI the capital as had been applied in the pu-U chase or improvement of the lines actually worked should be charged against their eamings. The meeting having adopted this recommendation, and set aside 5 per cent, of the net revenue towards a reserve fund, the amount of profit remaining was 64,0801., giving a dividend of 6 lire, or 5f. lOe. net~ share, which, with the interest already paid, makies the total dividend for the last half-year of 1856 at the rate of 12 per cent. per annum. The subscription list of the Mediterranean Telea graph is to be closed to-morrow, a considerable portion of the amount having been taken by persons at Manchester and Liverpool. According to the contract with Messrs. Newall and Co., the line, whioh will be 920 miles in length, is to be handed over to the company in a perfect state on the 31st of October next for a sum within the amount of the capital (120,0001.), on which the British Government have guaranteed 6 per cent. for 25 years. The following notice haa been issued by the Peninsular and Oriental Company with regard to passengers proceeding to India:- " The directors announce that, in order to provide addi. tional accommodation for the large number of passengers proceeding to India by the overland route during the later lonths of the year, they will despatch extra steamers from Southampton on the 27th of October and the 12th of December next, in corespondence with steamers from Suez to Ceylon, Madras, and Calcutta. For the convenience of homeward passengers, there will also he an extra departure from Calcutta about the 15th of MAarch, 1858."

It wb therefore th duty of the directors to protect the intersts: bf the p;eference shaeholders, as they had undertbakezz to do ythe statement in their report On the contrary, however, the directors sacrificed the interests of the preference ihaleholder by adopting an amenrdment to the proposal contained iu the. report, The preoent BiU eald an amended -Bill; but I inste&dof belug amendments they were the 'diret negative of the origna Bill.

C. Henry, LordWensleydale, and okhers On the subject of the Bill now before Parliament, and that a- simiar petition be now signed and prasented, and that a committee of preference shareholders be appointed to conduct the proceedings in such manner and to such extent as they may deem expedient. On the motion being seconded a discussion ensued, m which Mr. Greening, Mr. Camupbell, Mr. Hardy, Captain Gladstone, and other shareholders took part, in the course of which it was stAtod that seveail shareholders had sent their proxies to the directors on the faith of the sttement in the directors' reDrt that the interests of the preferenee shareholders Would he protected. It was understood that a Wbarncliffe meeting would not be necessay to snction the BilL Lord St. Leonard's would oertainly oppose the Bill in: the Upper House. It was looked upon sa a most imjustifiable measure, and hiought by some that the sooner they got rid of the directors who promoted -it the better it wrould be for the company. The motion was put and carried unanimously. Resolutions were also passed, pledging the meeting to su. scribe to the extent of 5 per cent. of the amount of their dividend towards the eipenses of opposing the Bill, anda calling upon the other preference ahareholders tb' do the s3me; andappointing Mrjleath, 1M. Greening, lr. CampbelL, and Mr. Williams a committee, with power to add to their number; three to he a quorum, to arr out the emeet g.terminatedo thi GRAND TRUNK OF CANADA. It appears that this company's Rief Bil paed th Houe of Assembly on the, 13th -nt. by-a maiority of 1S and it was expected to pass the LegLative Council on t e 19th ult, by a large majority. The object of the Bil is io dispense with Government directors at the board, ad to failitate the completion of the conpugys works fro6 Riviere du Loup to Sarnia. The Bill amends former Acts relating to the company, and provides that the present direators of the company appointed by tfhe Governor of the province shall go out ofloffice at the first general meeting of the shareholders for the election of directors; the company shall render half-yearly (and oftener if required by th Governor) to the inspector-general afull statement of their affairs, with a bhaance-sheet, the correctness of which shill Ibe attested under oath by the book-keeper, accountant,o otherofficerofthecompanly7uVig Zkmowfedgo of theae counts. It also provides for the production and iuspection of the books, accounts, and vouchers ofthecompany by the "board of audit." On condition that the company, by aeans bf preferental bonds and other loans, complete their railway from Rivire dn Lonp to Stratford, and thence by St. Mary's directto &rnia, including the Victoria-bridge and the other works, undertakings, and engagements mentioned in the Act of 186, and supply the railweay with a sufficient plant, rolling stock and appliances to work the same efficiently within the limits of time speciied bein one year aiter the time named int Act of 1856, and so long as they maintain and work the same regularly, the province foregoes all intereet on its claim against the company until the earnings and profits of the company, including those of the Atlantic and St. Lawrence Railroad Company, shall be sufficient to defray tho following charges:-L. All expenses of managing, working, and maintaining the works and plant of the company. 2. The rent of the Atantic and St. Lawrence Rail. way, and all interest on the bonds of the company, exclusive of those held by the province. 3. A dividend of 6 per cent. on the paid-up share capital of the company, in each year in which the surplus earnings shall admit of the same; and then in each year inwhich there shall be a sarplus over the above-named charges such surplus shall be applied to the payment of the interest on the Province Loan accruing in such year. The bonds and share capital herein mentioned shall be held to include and consist of all loans and paid-up capital which the company have raised or mayhereafter raise on4 jido under the autho. rity of any Act of the Provincial gature pased or to be passed, for any purpose authorized by ny uech Adct The company are authorized by the Bill to receive from the Receiver-General of the province, and expend upon the works, the proceeds of the preferential bonds, provided the sum so expended upon each work bears the same proportion to the total sum allotted to it as the sums paidin bear to the whole amount authorized to be raised by the Act, and that each of the several worls shall he proceeded with simultaneously and in the same proportion. This is con. sidered a very liberal measure. It will relieve the companpy from the Government claim of 3%IU,5007 sterling, which stood as a first mortgage on the whole of the company's railway and works and enable them to complete the undertaking.

Public opinion attributed the underground infiltrations to the supposed defective construction of the great main sewer which runs fromi the ie de illes du-Caviare and emptiesitself into the Seine-to-height of the Quai deBilly., Itiathe old bed of tu Meniluioeant rivulet, tothe waters of which many -of theinbabiteata still erroneouslyattribute theinundationorf wa.iiiActs ofthe northendof Pari. The MenlrontantrivuletpsmedformtrlY at the elevation- of theEaubonur cntmartre,fterhavng trawersed thetown from the Tempieoto the ditches wich. -ave given their name to the street eaLid us dee FoassMontmartre. Fromnthe Fauboig Montumartre, the rivulet ran i2lng the marshes of Grange-Bteilire, oer theground where the rue S'. Nicholas now stands, and reached the Seine where the Champeys-Iseqs:now are, nrthe Avenue That rivulet was a natural sewer. AU thie refuse of the town was emptied into it, and its fetid waters cxused vArious epidemical miasmaz As long as it flowed ihroigh. the town, uncovered in, it was a permanent nause of insalubrity. It was a-good deed to do away with it by walling itin, making it a sewrer, followring emoiy the course of itS old 'ced, and shutting np its infected water until they were lost in tjie -Seine. It has nov been ascertained that this sewrer does not allow a drop of its wnters to escape,-first because it was constructed with tie Zame .care and with the mme materials a the great sewe-ron the left bankc where the cellars ae not inundated; them berause its level is below the level of many oE ther cellars inundatedon therightb1nk, so much so that, by cutting through the cellas and making an openig into the scwer, the water inthe celars could be- emptied into- it. It appears that the same thing occiurrdix -10-a period of inundation which corresponds with the completion of the sewer, for MM. Buache and Bonami declared that the invasion of the wters complined of was to be attributed othoheavyrains, which had swollen the springs. In 1788 there was another indation and fresh conmplaint This mie the public voice attributed the submersion of th cellars to infiltrations frontbe greatreservoirs of the firene at Challiot. But the authorities ascertained that the Chalotreeeroiswerepesfetertight, not only from an exu ination of the reservoirs temselves, whIere not asingle fla was detected. but froom conclusive experiments. t ws proved, in fact, that the basins filled with water by the enines re-ained at the ssme level, due ilowAnee being madeor evaporation ; and this tiine, again, it was decided that-the inundation was caused by the heavy rains. . In 1818 and in 1837 the same rply wasgiven by the com- the opmlon thfirst sheet of werudergr.ound, coming from the heights, and which suppliss the wells, roight, after two yeas in which the faU of rin hat exceeddy about one-fifth the average fall, rise ashighas the level of the cellarfs. It is quite true that the fl of radn was unusually heavy in the years which preceded the four abovementioned inundations. The explanation appears, therefore, r admissible, but it does not exclude accidentl ciuses for similar infitrations. The point to be ascertained is, whether general inundations m some of the north districts of Pris can originate from other causes than the increase (intumescence) of the sheet of water below ground, and whether tne most recent inundation, that of 19i6, may not have a special character. The commission thinks so, and the report says so. It is advisable, however, that we should here confine our observations in a still stricter manner within the limits of a simple analysis. Public opinion has not, in fat, beem satisfied with the reasoning of those who have endeavoured to explin the inundation of 186 by the same cause as the preceding ones. It desigates openly the reervoir of La. Vlilette and the Canal St. artin as the sourre of the infiltrations which penetrated intothe cellars, andwhich. caused the calamities sufferad by the 5th, 3d, and 2i districts. The almost unanimous opinion of the inhabitants who have suffered from the inundation, their persitence in their conviction, and the information which they gave, made it the duty of the commissiou to study carefully that side of the question. lhe investigation appars to have induoed it to adopl ther general opinion. First oE a it ascertained that, according to the meetor. ological tables of the Paris Observatory, the fall of rain in the year preceding the inundation-mamely, in 1551-aid. not reach the usual average. In 1853 the amount of rain was below the average. Therefore, if it was true% as had been asserted, that the incursion of the water into the cellars was caused by the fall during two years of one-fifth more rain than the averape, the year 1856 did not come, nnder the conditions prescribed for an inundation. But a more conceusive fact attracted ithe attention of the commissioners-namely, the coinddence of the drying of the cellars with the drawing off of the water from thw Canal St. Martin, when the company find it necessaryto do so for repairs once a year, when the navigationis suspended, and the water having been tured off it was rossible to, look for the cracks and fissures which allowed it-to escape. This operation took place at the end of Augast, and at the same time the water in the cellars, which it was impossible to get rid of during the four preceding months, gradually disappeared of itei The repairshaving been made, the water was again let into the bagn of La Villette, whenL immediately theinundation of the ceas recommenced. The basin was again emuptied, and the water in the oellarn immediately subsided. The basin was examined with more minut care. The rviceawich had been overlookaed wer filled up, and the houses which had suffered from the inudations are definitively delivered from them. We shall not follow up further the reasoning upon which the commission founded their conviction. The faectg we have mentioned will suffice, if proved, for every man to, form his own opinion. Finally it maybe said, that with the discovery of the, cause of the evil, the evil itself has ceaeed. It will ot re-occur, for Govemment will take the necessry measures to prevent it. The municipal authorities, who are unceas. g i their exertions, will have rendered a new service by this discovery, which will enabile n inundation to be foreseen and prevented wheneve it does not anse from atmospheric causes.

TEL Ro-nyuazs TREATiES.-We leamn that intelligence has been received in London of the partial adjustment of the complications in respeot to the negotiations with Honduras. The President of that republic, General Don -Santos Guardiolia, has, we are informed, ratified the treaty signed by his Minister Senor Victor Eerran, with Lord Clarendon, in London, last year, being a treaty of commerce and friendship of tho ordinary kind, together with the important " additional article" which guarantees the neutrality of the railroad through the Isthmus of Honduras. But, for reasons which the Hondaras agents in this country do not appear to have been yet made acquainted with, the President has not ratified the convention which, signed at the same time as the feregoing treaty and by the same functionaries, provides for the transfer, on certain conditions, of the Bay Islands to Honduras, and the cession of certain rights of British sovereignty over the Mosquito territory. The Honduras Plenipotentiary accredited to :Englnnd andl Frnce, Senor Herran, and now resident in Paris, has received intimation froiCouutWalewskithatthe Government of France wfill immediately ratify a treaty with Honduras, similar in al respects to that just concluded between Great Britain and Honduras, and embracing the " additional article" securing the neutrality of the Honduras Interoceanic Railway. This line, extending from Porto Cabello, on the Atlantic, to the Bay of Fonseca on the Pacific, both termini being in the State of Honduras, is now being surveyed, with the approbation of Her Majesty's G}overnment, by a large st3ff of engineers who lately left Nev York for that purpose. They were a-companied thence by Senor Alvarado, the Honduras Mimister at Washington, where he had jast signed a treaty with the Government of the United States, identical with the Anglo-Honduras treaty, and containing likewise the " additional article " which insures the free use of the proposed railway, in tho interests of commerce and civilization, to all nations. PHARMACETCAL SOCIETY ON THE SALE OF PoIsoNs.-Yesterday evening a special pharmaceutical meeting of this society was held at the offices in Bloomsbury-square to consider the precautions which ought to be adopted with reference to the sale of poisons, and the provsons of a Bill on this subject now before the House of Lords. Mr. Jacob Bell, president of the society, took the ebair. The subject seemed to excite much interest, and the 'rbom was crowded. After a long discussion, in which Professor Rogers and Professor Redwood took part, with many others, the foUowing resolutions were agreed to:" That the Bill now before the Elouse of Lords, entitled an Aot to Restrict and Regulate the Sale of Poisons, is not calculated to effect the object for which it is professedly introduced, and that it would prove no proteotion to the public, but, on the contrary, greatly augment the existina evils, and also throw needless obstacles on the legitimate sale of useful and necessarymedicines." Thesecondresolution was-"That, in the event of the Bill making any further progress it is -desirable that a special general meeting of the whole Phar. maceutical Society be convened, and that local secretaries be communicated with on the subject, with the view of offering the most strennuous opposition to such a measure." At the close of the meeting the chairman intimated that it was the intention of the society to send a deputation to Earl Granville in order to explain to his lordship the objections to the proposed measure, and lay before him the suggestions of practical men upon the question of the sale of poisons. " READ v. PLUAIcR."-In the report of this case, tried in the Ball Court, which appeared in Tlte Times of yesterday, it ws mentioned that the defendant had desired letters to be addressed to him at the Conservative Club. Mr. Hall Plumer requests ns to state that, although a member of the Conservative Club, he was not the defendant In the case, and that he has not the slightest krnowledge of the transaction in question. THE ENFIELD SmLL-Armis FACTOnY.-It appears *rom an official report that the gross total amount of money expended at the' Enfield (Small-arms) Factory from the 1st day of January, 1854, to the 31st day of March, 1857 (34 years), was 240,5931., including 75,986l for buildings, 64,667. for machinery, 27,270. forstores, 4,7161. for salaries, and 67,9521. for wages. LONDOX GENERAL O.-=us COmPANY.-TraffiC receipts for the week ending May 30, 13,2151. 16s. 3d. Open-air preaching has been commenced by the Rev.

I LOYDOH, THURSDAY, JUNE 4, 1857. No doubt, the prezent state of Parliamentary business is not satisfactory. The most remarkable fact is the little that can be done, and the most ! prominent topics are those which are either to be I postponed or-abandoned in despair. The yearbefore. last we had the War; last year the Peace; this year thie Dissolution; and next year it would be very presumptuous to reckon on leisure for the ordinary work of legislation. Indeed, next year is already forestalled. It is devoted to a Reform BiUl; and' we only hope the public wil let the session of the following year pas without the noisy interlude of an Easter dissolution. It is idle to accuse anybody, or to defend anybody, as answerable for this state of things. The law of self-preservation is as strong in politicians as in other men, and, ever shipwrecked, ever struggling with the breakers, they naturaUy decline to share with any rival the plank which will not support both. Advise any one to be reasonable in his demands on the time and interest of the Legislature, and he requests you to direct your advice to some other more exigent or more successful offender. Perhaps, it comes at lst to that question of parties which some acute observers have lately told us is now in undue abeyance. Strong measures and a policy to make its way through ephemeral obstacles are only to be expected from powerful parties under great atimulus. So it has been said that the succession of important measirues passed by the newly Reformed Parliament had been elaborated in opposition, and there had accumulated the nwme7tum which carried them through the double bar of the gilature. Are we to look out of doors, then, for measures, nnd is it not the fault of the represend, or rather of the unrepresented and the misrepresented, that Parliament finds itself too free, too disengaged, too litte interested ? Does it want pressure from without, as the hmran frame does the atmospherie preseure and as the mind does the pressure of pasion and of circumstances ? The state of politic. for several years has been unfavourable for the production of measures within the high political world. We have had a divided, or rather comminuted Opposition, of which the largest portion had committed itself to the hopeless and disgraceful cause of Agricultural Protection, and the other portions were either wanting in common sense or chiefly actuated by a desire to weaken the Government of the day, while the latter had naturally no wish to enter upon any new adventures. No one can say how long this state of things will continue, but while it does we must not look to Governments or Parliaments for new measures. After this preamble it will readily be guessed that woe ar not likely to 'promise much entertainment for the brief period of two months that remains of the session. When the little affair of the PnrrrcEss RoYA's dowry has been settled the Lower House will soon take up the Mariage and Divorce Bill, which will, -we believe, be essentially altered before it is sent back to the House of Lords. We should hope that, if only to dispose of an annual annoyance, and to satisfy a continual but reasonable importunity, the Oaths B3ill will be permitted to pass this time. All parties will co-operate to pass the measures for the regulation of Joint-stock Companies and the punishment of flagrant frauds by trustees. When it is considered that besides these measures a Medical Bill has to be revised and contracted to reasonable limits, that something is to be done with publichouses and beershops, and the that Army and Navy Estimates are not quite gone through, we do not see much chance for any more new measures this year. The Election Expenses Bill may be a good one, as far as it goes, but it is an incomplete measure, as any measure widl be thlat encroaches by anticipation on one of a more comprehensive character. We do not understand the obstinacy which indtces some honest politicians to urge their hobbies not only to the obstruction of general business, but to the injury of the very object they profess to have in view. Nothing woulld now tend so much to secure an effectual measure of Parliamentary. Reform next session as a' general agreement to, reserve the whole subject to that session, ' and devote it to the work. We shall also, to all appearr ance, have to give up the settlement of thp Church-rate Question; or rather, for one more year it will be left to the popular and now legal arbitrament of pariah vestries, public meetings. and sectarian agitators. This would not be our way of healing a general and still spreading sore; but, if others so will it, the feud must take its course. What else is there ? Education ? Twenty sessions have seen no progress in it ;-what is to be expected from two months? No; Sir JoHN PAxflTGTON, like Lord JoEs RussELL, and a host of competitors in this department, must be content to see his Bill pass to the grave of its forefathers. There is something so stale in boolks, so novel in real life, so like a suggestion from FhINON'S Teiemachus, and so unlike anything in Hansard, in the idea of all parties co-operating to pass measures of undoubted and general utility, that we should almost risk our character for sanity if we were seriously to press it on our legislators,_ even on the two hundred new and comparatively unsophisticated members. Of course, it is not the way to get on, to acquire party friends, to win confidence, and even get into place. If, too, the political sections could hope to do anything by the conflict of' parties,-if they had so much in their budgets of measures that they could point to, and make a ground for our support, we should not hint at such a childish idea of patriotism as that we refer to. The two hundred new members must not, however, take offence if we hazard an estimate that not one in ten will ever get any good by the most factious proceeding, or by the most devoted allegiance to the most mischievous leaders. As the chances, then, are so great against any personal gain, or even any political satisfaction, by mere factiousness, we do just venture to throw out a hint that they may as well, some of them, try the course suggested by the rude instinct of natural benevolence and the light of plain common sense. It is quite possible that, in the end, they may look back with more pleasure to having contributed to a number of useful measures than to having generally done nothing-often a good deal of harm. We are aware that the idea of patriotism divested of party sounds very like a platitude; and if party did much more than patriotism we might ourselves think the former a substance, the latter a name. It so happens, however, that much which is accounted very good faction in these days is quite as inoperative, quite as barren of all results, as the greenest Utopian theory. So, even with the admission that patriotism has not always the weight that it deserves, we may still ask our legislators to give up party obligations, which simply tie their hands and condemn them to political sterility and insignificance.
Our present war with China is certainly as strange a kind of hostility as we have lately seen. To read the accounts in all journals, British and foreign, it would seem that the eivilized world was about to precipitate itself on the offending Celestial Empire. England, France, and the United States are represented by special Envoys; Portugal demanda redress for certain wrongs of her own; Holland is strengthening her force in the Eastern seas; even Sardinia and Spain will have a frigate or two off the Chinese ecoast. One would think that at the Chinese 'ports all would be confusion, dismay, or stern defikice, and that in London and Liverpool merchaAts would be winding up their dealings in tea in contemplation of several months of slaughter; but Moth!ing- of the 1kintldseemsJkely to, take place, The "I enemy," a-we,e aust now- call the, ¢inese, is not in the common sense of-the word an enemy at -al. H all wo have dealings with him are traitors to the QuExN there will be pleniy of treason, for the business at all the ports, except Canton, goes on 3 most continuouisly and prosperously. 'While our arsenals ring with the noise of preparation, and our transports are carrying, or attempting to carry, regiment after regiment against these moneymaidng barbarians, the Chinese themselves are quietly going on in the old fashion, draining oar silver by the million, and supplying us with our principal beverage as if YBn and BOWRENG had never existed. Certainly trade is a mighty power. The great NA|,oLEow, when he commanded Europe, could not prevent the dealers of Amsterdam and Eanburg from being supplied with English cottons, hardware, and flannels; and then national power,. honour, and even safety were at stake, and each people hated the other with a hatred which it is difficult in the present day to conceive. So we cannot wonder that in this affair, which is only the dispute of an enterprising European. natiohn ;with the Governor and -populace of a provincial Chinese city, the commercial com- munity should hardly allow their dealings to beaffected by the rumours of war. Whatever may happen we shall want tea and silk, and the Chinese: will sell them. While British fleets are blockading Canton, while gunboats are ascendingthe rivers, and perhaps an army is in full march fo: Peldn itself, the great body of the Chinese will plant and spin as before, and bring down their produce to any spot where our armed vessels. are not actually present. What, then, is to be done with this people, who cannot understand that they are at war wlth us, particularly as they are abetted by a legion of English traders, who equally refuse to comprehend the serious posture of affairs? We may attack Canton as before, drive out or: capte or shoot Governor Ysn, retain the city, or evacuate it as we please. 'Whatever may take place it seems likely that the rest of China will take matters as coolly as if we had spent our shot and shell against any savages on the coast of Africa. The northern ports will probably drive an increasing trade, and, if our commanders appear before Shanghai or Foo-choo, they will be rceived politely by a set of stolid Mandarins, who will express the greatest surprise on hearing that the barbarians have come for any other purpose than to buy tea or sell opium. We are far from saying that the late events will not lead to great changes in China indeed be the last to wish that the present opportunity of bringing the empire into closer relations 'with Europe should be lost for want of vigour or enterprise. We would merely call attention to the strange cbaracter of the war, and the absence of anything like determined hostility on either side. That the Chinese will be obstinate, impudent, deceitful, dilatory, and everything that is provoking is likely enough, but that we shaU have to inflict severe chastisement on any district except insolent and turbulent Canton is not in accordance with present appearances. Our own Government certainly seems to be in no terror as to Chinese prowess. We seem to be as little of opinion that war means fighting as our enemies, for while our force in those seas is so small that the Admiral has been content to stand for months on the defensive, and fears were felt at one time for the safety of Hongkong and Singapore, we yet learn that this force is being weakened by the return to England of every vessel the term of whose commission has expired. The Winchester, thecrew and Marines of which played a great part in the operations in the Canton river, returned the other day, and is nowbeing dismantledcat Chatham; and it cannot be said that she has returned because sailing vessels are no longer thought serviceable, for the fact is that she has been relieved by the Raleigh,' anotlier sailing ship, which has just nalrowly escaped destruction on the Chinese coast.- The steamer Barracouta. has also come home, and, we believe, the Encounter too. All this does not look as if our authorities anticipated that the Chinese would at all infringe on the apparently implied bargain that they should wait until we are quite ready to destroy them. Indeed, even when we do begin, it is difficult to imagine what a great naval force, composed of large ships, will have to do. Junks of all kinds will soon be swept from the sea, and then gunboats for shoal water will be chiefLy required, and the best use of a frigate will be to fumnish a good strong party to serve on shore. The Government would seem to consider that the naval part of the. operations will be easily carried through. If all that past experience has taught us may be relied upon, the resistance of the enemy on land will be of little avail against a disciplined foree of Anglo-Indian troops. The chief obstacles to success, if the Chinese should prove obstinate, would be the climate, the distance, and our own ignorence of the country. We shal probably find ourselves in contact with a people who may fear and dislike us, but have really not quarrelled with us, and have been, up to the hour of invasion, carrying on a busy traffic with our merchants. In fact, England is at war more with the institutions of China as represented by the Canton mob than with the Celestial EmPEROoR and his people. It is the bigotryand seclusion which form the traditional policy of the country, and which inspired the insolence of YEH and the fanaticism of his followers, that have brought down the anger of Europe on the Chinese State. We go to teach a moral lesson, and if the Chinese discover that it will be to their advantage to remain quiet and continue their intercourse with Europeans, they will add to their reputation as a sensible and prudent people.
In form and dimensions almost exactly similar, with objects professedly identical, and provisions not apparently discordant, two separate Bills have recently been brought into the House of Commons, and within a few days of each other were ordered to be printed. Both these measures are designed to " alter and amend the " laws regulating the Medical Profession," and both adopt for that purpose the same description of machinery. To a uon-professional reader the distinction between the two schemes might not appear very considerable, and yet in reality there are great principles at isaue and strong diversities of opinion represented in the contest for favour. One' fundamental point is confessed and assumed by all parties, and is implied indeed in the whole proceeding-viz., that the Meedical Profession is in need of regulation, with a view to the enforcement of a better and more uniform standard of ability in its practitioners. At present, access to the 'profession can be obtained in a great variety of ways and on a great variety of terms. It does not follow that two persons, though both may be genuine Doctors of Medicine, or both regularly licensed practitioners of some inferior grade, have gone through the same studies, been tried by the same tests, or approved by the same authorities. The different schools of medicine or corporate bodies at present granting licences to practice have been at liberty to fix their own standards of competence, and under such conditions there is always a probability that rivalry should take a form prejudicial to the profession and the public too. When Colleges bid against one another for graduates the only resource for those low in general favour ia to diminish the rigour of theii: dead,adt aeu - dema~~~~~nd,-az oraQ p-indulgence whtte lac inre,utao2.Apart, too} from the influenlce of these natural temptations there are manjfes di i- advantages in tho multiplication of AUthoritis man {he uncertainlty of the professional stanldard. Where there can ba no uniformuit of test or appeal theremusmt be great diffculty in establishing a case of incompetence, and opportunitie5 are alway open for the intrusion of unqualified or half-qualifi pr a ctit ionleras. To correct these evils, and to placs the profession on a better footing than before, the two Bills referred to have been prepared. One of them bears Lord :r.cno's name; the other is Imo7wn as Mlr. HEADLAS', and both prce with rmarkble analogies of purpose and expression. Both propose a general system of registiation for all medical practitioners, inscription on the register being. the certificate of professional qualification. Bothpropose for future candidates a regular system of examiination, prelimninary. as well;a technical,~ ad both would establisih a kind of supreme Councilf to secure the fulfilment of the purpOses designed. The result of either Vmeasur becoming law wouldbe, that any person claiming a* title to practise must prove his claim, like a voter at- an election, - by means of the register, so that his competence could be readily* ascertained, while a general urn-~ formity of education and training wrould be brought about. We mnay asue from the aimilarity of these provisions that they represent the nature of the reform felt on all sides to be indispensable, and* the difference, therefore, between the two-Bills must be looked for in the macahinery which they respectively create. Here, indead, the distinction becomes easily discoverable, and -with- such importanice is it invested that the whole profession, we are told, is prepared to sutpport Mr. Haiaas Bill, and to oppose that of Lord ELOH[O. The. grounds of these sympathies can be very sOOn explained. Discarding all technical details, we may describe one Bill as establishing new Boards of Gzovernment for the MIedical Profession, and the other as charging the old Boards with the duty of new wrork. Lord Thono is the man who provides, the new broom,-Mr. HEDLA he who promises clesn sweeping without any change of instruments. Yet even here the resemblance between the two Bills seems considerable. It is true that Lord EICIIO'S Council is nominated by the Unowx, and connected writh the new institution of the Board of Health, wrhereas Mr. xnAnsf aCouncil,with the exception of six seats reserved for Cnoa>- appointments, is to consist of representatives of the existing licensing bodies. Yet the Boards of professional Examiners respectively projected are to derive their authority and their powers from similar sources-viz., from the existing professional Coleges, Mr. Hnnruax remitting these functions mainly to existing(b bodies, while Lord Erco empowvers sulch bodies to appoint the persons who are to discharge them. In substance, howrever, the contest may be regarded as we have described iti a dispute betwFeen reformers who desire entire renovation, and corporations to be reformed, whoe wish to keep the operation, as far as may be, in their owvn hands. Obviously, therefore, it need be no matter of sulrprise if Dr. Hx&xr A^xeS Bill should find favour with the profession. It is not, however, quite clear that these sympathies of the profession can be claimed in any comprehensive aeceptation of the word. The Colleges of~ Physicians and Surgeons, through their governing bodies, may be partial to MIr. HEAsr ' measure without its being necsesarily implied that a1l the physicians and surgeons of Egland are of thleir opinion; for these classes constitute a very numerous body of gentlemen, and are by no means so effectually represented inl the corporations abovementioned as to be bound in sentiment by their decisions. Mr. RH4Tn, in fact, derives his cbief support -from thosae identical Boards of Governmnent whose aggregate performances are admitted to be so unsatisfactory ; andl our coluns have, already inlformed the public that there are independent practitioners who are disposed to ag ree with Lord ELOHO. There is no harm in paying a certain deference to the representations of functionaries whose peculiar privileges are brought under question; probably wve owe the success and tranquillity attendinlg our domestic reforms to the consideration usuaLly extended in such cases, but it is at the same time evident that self-advocacy. must be listened to with a good deal of caution. Mn. HEADLAWrs supporters may be both sincere and inltelligent, but they are not very likely to be disinterested. For ourselves, we can only look at these rival measures as they conlcern the public, and we feel bound to say that MIr. H2Lr> s Bill reads likte ani attempt to save as mny existing privileges as possible at the ex;pense of simplicity, if not of effect. We cannot help suspecting that Lord Exncno's Bill would probably be thought satisfac-l tory enough if there were no established interests to be consulted. It is said that whatever good the latter contains is to be found in the former without the drawback of unnecessary violence to the independence and self-government of a profession; but are the proposed objects as certain to be effected inl one case as the other ? Would Mr. E[Dnw make as sure work as Lord ELnco ? We have seen it remarked that Mfr. HEADLAM provides for the encouragement of progressive study, whereas LordI FJLCHO leaves everything optional beyond a single minimsunm standard, as if, in short, proficiencyI would be the result in one case, and sufficiency in the other. Even here, however, as on so many other points, the rivalry of the tw.o measures has produced a singular analogy of provisions, for, thou,gh Lord Eroo's scheme certainly contemplates but one certificate, as it were, of com- petence, it especially provides that any practitioner,. on obtaining any further degrees or titles of honour, may have them attached as so muany distinctions to his ordinary qualification in the register. The interests of the public inI this case are extremely simple anld obvious. We desire merely, the effiectual removal of acknowledged evils, and such provisions for the fulture as shall insure the highest1I attainable standard in the ran)ks of the Medical Profession. Lord Ex.cno and Mr. Hxanr.s both promise these results, and both resort, appar ently, ! to similar means for securing them; but, as the former seems to be looking to the country at large, while the latter appears en,tangled with the interestsa of privileged corporations, we caunot help believing that Lord ThLcno is the better bidder of the tw-o.

STrAnMSCS OF SUGAR.Soine returns relative to gar have been laid on the table of the Rouse of Commons on he motion of fr. Moffatt, M1.P. It hence appears that the quantity of unrefined sugar imported and retained for domestic consumption in the uited ldngdom last year amounted to 1,618,750 cwt., and the quantity of refined sur to 256,601 owt. The quantity of unrefined sugar consnmed in former years was as follows-viz. -Im 1855 2,321,434 cwt.; in 1854 2,439.291 cwt., in 1853 1.531.978 cwt.; in 1852 682,526 c*t,; in 1851 1,379,040 evt.; in 1850 908,395 cwt. Last Year 498,773.cwt. were imported from Caba; 173,727 from Porto Bico; 38,577 from Datch Guian; 18,962 from the United States of America ; 406,964 from Brazil- 187,281 fromn the Philippines; 39,726 from Holland . 204,53 from. France; and 21,617 cwt. from Portugal. The aggregata quantity of foreign sugar -of all sorte retained for home consmption last year was 1,875,351 cwt. A second return shows that last year there were imported from the British West Indies 1,253,280 cwt. of sugar not equal to white-clayed, aud 1,560,999 cwt. not equal to brown-clayed; from the. Mauritius, 83,423 cwt not equal to white-clayed, and 302,590 notequal tQ brown; from the East Indies, 666,967 cat not equalto whiteclayed, and 508,289 not equal to brown-clayed. There were also imported somesmaller quantities of sugar equal to white-clayed. The gross total quantity of all sugar (unrefined) retained for home consmption last ear was 6,813,470c wt The net revenue on all aorts of sganrs lt year amounted to 5,129,6461. The average price of BritLsh West India muscovado sugar (ex.-duty) was 30s., and that of Ravannab sugar (ordinary yellow), exclusive of daty, 31R 6d. per cwt. Homi TEACBRS AND BOOES FOR TEz BuD.- A public meeting of a society recently formed for the hometeaching of the blind, and sup p ing them with books in .Mr. Moon's type, was held at Willis's Room, St. James's. eterdayafternoon, the Earl of Shafteebury in the chair. 1ne report stated that the object of the society is to seek out the blind and teach them to read at their own homes, in the simplified system introduced by Mr. Moon (who is himself blnd), a system which persons of the dullest touch can easllearn. The whole of the Nrew and the greater part of the Old Testament, besides a larme collection of hymns, the church service, the Pig7im's Progress, and other books, as well as maps, are already published in this type, and the society proposes to establish lending libraries, comprLsing a complete set of these publications, in the various neighbourhoods brought under its operation. Oat of 29,000 blind persons in Great Britain half are above 50 years of age. Two teachers have been employed in London, %herethereare2,305blind. Theteachershave visited236 pupils at their own homes, three-fourths of whom are fronm 40 to 84 'yeas of age; 11T have leaned to read in 1S months, of whom about one-half are above 50 years of age, andeight of them between 70 and 75. The facility with which these ged persOnS have learned to rd by Moon's sTstem is proved by the fact that 62 could read at ihe first, second, or third lesson, half of them between 40and 70 years of age, and two 73 years old, whereas 11 out of the 62 had tried in vain to learn by otber systes In the last six months associations have been formed at Edinburgh, Carlisle. Liverpool, EudderEfleld, Richmond, and CornWall. The meeting was addressed by the Rev. Dr. M'Caul, the Rev. A. Christopher the Rev. - horan, Mr. Moon, arid other gentlemen, ana in the course of the afternoon the superiotity of the %stem. was exemplified by the manner in which two of t pupils-oneapCor man deaf as well as blind-read pbasges from the sriptares. In bringing the meetingtoa close ord Shaftesbury said, rai description could convey the state of many of the blind of this great metropolis; the horrible state of destitution and desolation in which they were was something which they must reaize with their own eyes, and not take secondhand from the lips of any man. The faots which had been mentioned were auite Eufficient to prove the necessity of a society emplojing homne teachers whose basiness it should be to take under their charge the physical and spiritual necessities of these most unhappy people.

TRE DXPEDITIODT TO PERSIA. I (FlBOu OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT. I O3HAM&fERAH, ARIL 2. Little in going on here since the return of the exIpedition to Ahwaz. Reports received from the districts about Shuster and Dizful give a lamentable descrip ion of the Persian army. After their disgraceful flight at the appearance of the three small river steamers they retired to Dizfui, and were plundered at every step by hordes of marauding Arabs. Shortly after their arrival at that post-an urgent application was received by the Shahzadah from the Govermment party at Shuster, representlug that the sheikhs and townspeople were ripe for revolt, and would certainly massacre them unleus a.sistance were seut to them immediately. l'he Shahzad3h accordingly marched thither with several regiments, but their, situation is rather precarious, as the people are reported to be plotting with the Bukhtiari for their expulsion. The entire -my is unprovided with tents, and very badly off for supplies. The Shahzad8h is anxious to retire upon lspahan, but such is the attitude assumed by the Bulkhtiari and Segwend that he is afraid to attempt a march through the passes. His own son prepartd to start for the interior a short time ago, but dread of the wild mountain tribes has decided him to remain where he is for the present. There .an be little doubt that were it nowr allowable for Us to advance upon Shuster, the whole Persian army would surrender at discretion rather than fight or attempt to force their way towards Ispahan. Up to this date no further news has been received va1 England or India. All we know isthat peace was signed at Paris on the 4thult. Had we been ignorant of that fact for a few days longer our troops ere this would have been removed to a better climate, in the direction of Shuster; as it is we cannot stir from this, not knowing what the result of the negotiations may be. Fortunately, the weather has been tolerably - Dmaol hitherto, and the troops have been healthy; now it is getting hot, and we may expect much sickness uuless the men are speedily removed from Mohammerah. The good people at home seem not to be aware how they have embarrassed the arrangements of our General by taking the negotiations out 'of his hands. Every effort is being made to collect building materials to erect huts at Bushire, where I suppose some part of this force will be located until the terms of the treaty have been fulfilled. A young midshipman named Birch, of the sloop Falkland, which s anobored at Marghill, near Bussorah, was drowned yesterday while bathing in a creek not far from the depot. There have been several accidents of the same kind in the Karoon before Mohammerah, where the stream is so rapid that few7 of those who are unfortumate enough to fall into it are saved. ArrIL 2L A messenger has just arrived from the Shahzadah at Shuster with a letter to Sir James, the purport of which, I understand, is to inquire whether a report which had reached the Prime MAinister at Teheran, through the French Charg6 -d'Affaires there, to the effect that peace had been signed at Paris on the 4th of March, was true. The Persians hereabouts are notoriously anxious to have nothing more to do with the English in the fighting ine. Ap=, 22. The long-looked for steamer Comet has arrived from Bagdad, bringing Galignaxi up to the 18th ult. I suppose the draught of the treaty tberein published rnay be regarded as authentic. As far as I can le rn, Feruk Khan had consented to much more thasi we have now obtained from Persia in his negotatbons with Lord Stratford de Redeliffe, and what has finally been agreed upon seems to be very much below what we had imperatively demanded. All these concesions, moreover, have been made subsequent to our successes over the Persian forces. We feel persuaded that, though Sir James might not have insisted upon all the original demands, he would certainly have obtained something more than what has now satisfied the English Ministry. We are in great difficulty about our troops. Sir James, it appears, had intended, on hearing that peace had been signed, to withdraw a large portion of them to India, in order to prevent their unnecessary exposure to this dreadful climate during the summer months. Now it is reported that he does not feel himuself authorized to do so, and must house the troops and supply them, here and at Bushire, as best he may. Itis said that he is greatly annoyed at being thus unnecessarily embarrassed, and who can wonder at it ? However, he intends to do the best he can, and is at work day and night giving directions and superintending the arrangenments for the location of the troops. Captain Green, his military secretary, and the Quartermaster-General are to be despatched to Sablah, a p lace 12 miles higher up on the banks of the Karoon, to report upon its fitness for a military camp ; and Sir James intends going thither himself, with General Havelock and the Superintending Surgeon, to see how far it promises to be a healthy locality. It is beyond the swamps, and mud huts may be erected there without great difficulty. One great drawback is thlat the summer is fast approaching, and unless the men have better protection than tents g,reat sickness may arise among them. Something of the same kind is to be done at Bushire, and Sir James talks of going thither as soon as he has perfected the arraugements here. If the Ministry at home had only left matters in his hands a better peace would have been made, and one condition would have been that he should locate his troops in the most healthy locality while it was necessary for them to occupy the country. According to the terms of the treaty the ratifications may be delayed till the beginning of June, and we are to continue here till Affghanistan has been evacuated by the Persian troops, and until the British mission has been received at Teheran.
THI SERVICES AT EXE2;,ER HALL. TO THIEBDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I amn not going to attempt an answer to your article upon the Exseter-haU " prophesyings." It is written with your usual felicity of illustration, but, for all this, it will fsil to convince those wbo think with Lord Dungannon that these religious services in Exeter-haU are not so free from objection as you represent thena to be. Wben some of the clergy took to open air preaching nobody exclaimed against it, becauise they occupied a sort of neutral ground in these endeavours to call the uu asses to tbe fear of God. But to abandon the church for the concert room merely because the churches are ill attended is a eoncession to apathy many dissenters would object to. Instead of these preachings filling the churches, wlhile they last they :_U drain them. Surely tlise who subscribed thtir money ards the building the two or three hundr, d churches which the late Bishop of London consecrated will secretly resolve to spend no muore in the cause of church-building until they have seen the issue of this movement. We cannot forget, too, that it follows upon the preaching of Mr. Spurgeon, the chief characteristic of which seems to be that its effectiveness is in proportion to the multitude addie&ed. I need hardly remind you that Leighton, to whose persuasive preachiDg B irnet bas borne such eloquent testimnony, thought a very large church was the last place where a very deep impression was to bo made upon an audience. Many, with good reason, do not like to see the fathers of the church taking their cue fromn the young Baptist. Comparisons are sometimes odious, therefore we should not provoke themn. The Exeter-hall congregations, on comparing the performlances of our church dignitaries with ose of Nr. Spurgeon, may thiik they do well to keep from churcb, and some who bave hitherto been habitual attendlants may cease to be so. There is no denying -the whole proceeding must tend to lower our reverence for -sacred place. In the country clergnsien not ve-ry highly iftced will iifallibly have these "e prophesyings" thrown in their teeth as an excuse for abandoning the church for the chapel. If it is so desirable that people should be brought 4,ogether in vast multitudes to hear the Word of God, there are, as you reniark, St. Paul's and Westminster Abbey for them. If these ware properly arranged for evening service, I will undertake to say such congregations would assemrble in thenm as would satisfy the mnost ambitious of lpreechers. I am, Sir, like nmany others, for increasing the elasticity -of the church, but not in this irregular manner. I could urge many more objections to tbese proceedings ; but I will forbear to do so, as I am not at all sure whether such as I ihave already advanced will be deemed worth your notice. - our obedient servant.

-IRBLANDO PROM OUR OWN OGRREPONDrT.) DUBLIN, WPNES3DAY MomINoG. THE OATHS BILL. The Evening Post, on the authority of its London correspondent, supplies the following particlIars in connexion with a meeting held at the stafford Club to consider the provisions of the Oaths Bill now in course of being pa;sed through the Houze of Commons:- " I gave you in my letter of last evening a few hurrie& observations respecting the meeting of the Roman Ca. tholics of England, held at the Stafford Olub yesterday, the Duke of Norfolk in the chair, to which it now ap. pears bta chosen few of the Irish M.P.'s were invited,Mr. Bowyer, of course, he being the mouthpiece of the English Roman Catholics; but those of -what were deemed the less aristocratio were omittedL This meeting has given riss to much comment among the Irish Roman Catholics in the House of Commons (Lord Edward Howard is the only English Catholio representative in the Lower House), some of whom feel not a little hurt by the exclusiveness of the meeting, and those who were hanonred by an invitation felt not a little mortified to find aresolutloss prepared to the effect that the Catholic oath, now used. and by virtue of which the members took their seats, and had submitted, Nwas deemed an insulto their religion. The resolation was subsequently withdravwn. This does not appear the best mode of securing%co-operation, particularly in this first approach of the English Roman Catholics, who heretofore have kept aloof from the Irisb, And only concurred to accept the benefit obtained by the latter, without co-operation in the struggle, for which they were too proud and aristocratic. The present move of those lordly folk appears to be to obtain support from the Irish members in opposing the Oaths Bill, as it does not assimilato the oath require by the Rtoman Catholics; and, as I mentioned to I you, Lord Palmerston is to be waited on and tested on thls point. If he refuse to accede to their propvsition, what course is to be pursued? Some suggest that the Irish Catholic members should in a body oppose the Bill, and so, contrary to all principles of liberality and toleration, increase the chance of continuing the disability of the Jews. Others take a more truly liberal view, and say we should not exelude others from the benefits we enjoy because the mode of admitting thein to a like enjoyment is not in terms which we admire or approved." The Cork Eexaminer, or, indeed, it mnay be said Mr. John Francis Maguire, referring to this meeting, observes that a critical question of policy and principle arises in this case for the decision of Cathole numbers. They must either endanger a measure of religious toleration by withholding their support because it does not go far enough, or they must vote for a BiU which, though in the direction of religious liberty, still implies intolerance as far as the Roman Catholics are concerned. All things considered, the Examiner, as an organ of civil and religious liberty, thinks the lattier alternative less judicious i point of policy, and thterefore it is best that the Jews' manacles should not be unloosed so long as the Roman Catholics have even the last remnant of a grievance to complain of. The argument in favour of this dog-in-manger theory is thus put:- " Suppose the Catholic oath alone remains, the opporit nity of having it altered may be most indefnite. There may be no varty in Parliament desirous to urge on the question. We linow that it is often more difficult to obta a proper occasion for bringing a question before Parliament than to make it succeed when so brought forward; aud we know also that it is by having our case bound up in principle with that of other parts of the kingdom, or other classes, and under questions interesting to English statesmen, we have usually comne in for any share of justice. Now, are those statesmen likely to take as much interest in the abolhton of the Catholic oath as they do, from personal or other reasons, in that which keepe out the Jews? Are we sure that a Ministry will risk a collision with all the bigotry of the House of Commons and of England-that they will provoke the whole race of Spoonerites-for the sake of an exclusive benefit to us? And ought we not, then, to insist upon retaining, or at least give no assistance in removing that grievance which immediately fixes attention and interest on the question, and thus keep it open? If there be a settlement let it be a complete one. If the Jews enter Parlian,ent unsworn let it be in virtue of a common prvilege and principle of equality, which shall make at east as much allowance for the conscience of a Catholic as that of an unbeliever. We have a right to say that, unless justice be done to ourselves we shall not do anything to lessen the motives and inducements for dealing vwith the whole question. And in acting oa this policy Catholies would have the assurance that they were not obstructing any great measure of justice, this Jew Bill being merely a pet question, which private friendsbip has ledi one or two sttesmen to identify themselves WAit, and it not being pretended, if Baron Rothschid were kept out of Parliament for ever; that the public deliberations would suffer very much thereby. There is not a greater political error than that of giving up part of a grievance. O'Connell was thought to have coninitted a grave mistake in consenting to the tithe settlement, which has made it so much more difFicult to disturb the Church establishment than if the whole grievance were kept raw and open. This rule of policy applies with peculiar force to the present instance, because the Catholic oath, beine merely a matter of insult, is not likely to be a subject of consideration separately and detached. from that which causes the positive exclusion of the Jews." TrE QUEN S iBYTEMA. It was only yesterday that Her Majesty's birthday was celebrated in. Dublin, the eve4t. beiiigdeferred ntil the return of Lord Carlisle from his visit to England. The review in the Park was the great and sole attraction, and, although the morning was dark and damp, with the wind at the wet point (S.E.), the weather, strange to say, cleared up just at the right time, and before thesmoke from the first Royal salute had cleared away, the sun shone out as It might be expected to shine on the second day of June. The Fifteen A cres presented its usual array of all classes of Dublin sooiety, and all seemed determined to be happy and to make holyday. There were present-the Royal Artillery, the 1st and 2d Dragoons, the 17th Lancers, the 2d battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the 50th (Queen's Own), the 3d battalion of the 60th Rifles, the 77th and 95th Regiments, and the enrolled pensioners with staff, colours and batd. His Excellency, escorted by a troop of the 1st Dragoons, and accompanied by Colonel Hastings, Lieutenant-Colonel Gore, and the Hon. Captain Butler, arrived on the ground from the Viceregal Lodge about 12 o'clock, and was saluted by a discharge of 21 guns, which was followed by a salute given by the entire body of infantry, Lord Seaton was the general in command of the field, and had on his staff Major Colborne, Captain Middleton, of the 2d Dragoon Guards, and Captain Moore. The Hon. Colonel R. Bruce commanded the first brigade of infantry, and MIajor-General Cunningham commanded the second brigade. The cavalry were under the command of MWajor -General Parlby. The total of all arms on the field nurnbered 4,520. IRELAID iN 1857. After a brief reference to the social state of Ireland some ten years back, the Banner of Ulster then describes the position and prospects of the country in 1867:- " We hear much of the difficulty of procuring hands at out-door labour, and those whose vocation it is to grumble wax eloquent in describing thegreat scarcity of workpeople; but who that recollects the melancholy state of things in Irehad ten ygars ago will not sing of Fifty-seven ? On the lst of Janua=, 1849, there were 620,000 paupers in all the union worlkhouses and on the books of outdoor relief. On the same date of the present year Ireland's pauper population was only about 65,00, or say one pauper to every h-mdred of the population. Surely the Saxon as well as the Celt should exult in this, the greatest rairacle of miodern days, that Ireland is fast becoming one of the least pauperized countries in Europe. The vast influence which successful or depressive agriculture exercises on the financial condition of any nation is very fully illustrated by the relative returns of Irish banks in 1849 and in 1857. We give the figures-of note circulation at all the Irish banks, as wel as the amount of bullion held in September, 1849, and those of the last month's account:- Nloteircuatt,on. Beli,o,. 1849 .£. ..,3840,450 .£1,.R62-5,000 1857 ... .. 7,150,000 ... 2,492,000 1857 promiscs, more thau any other year for the last 24, to give effect to industrial prosperity in IreLand. Large additional tracts of soil have been placed under the plough and spade. Hundreds of acres of land in Ulster which had not been broken up for half a century are now sown in grain or planted with potatoes. The effect of these improvements can hardly be estimated at their full value. Not only have they increased the productive powers of the soil, in many cases fully one-third, and in some instances one-half, be- they maie land so muhmrZviycutvtdta i the recent puth to get in the oats and potatoes there was mnore work done in a single week than was usually performed in a whole month. " While farming operations were thus pushed on, the process of vegetation seemed to rise in proportion to the emergency, and the reult has been that here, on the 2d day of June, the potato lands planted early last month are as wel forward as those of the same period of last year, and when the finish had been three weeks earlier. Oats never appeared better, and wheat lands exhibit continued luxuriousness. Absence of those frosts which acted so severely on the potato lands last year has done good service to the young plants, and if the preient splendid weather continues the early crop of potatoes will be ready for market much earlier than could have been anticipated. During the four months ending the 30th of April there were imprted into the united kingdom 0,157 horned cattle 4,368 calves, 11,798 sheep, and 287 hg.Ti wudtl fwi h Duke of Ricbhmond called 'ruinous COmpetitiom' At present, however, the 'ruined' agriculturists are obtainingfor all descriptions of farm stock nearly 100 per cent, above the quotations of 1842.

MILITABY AND NA YAL INTBLLIGENCE His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge, as the, General Commanding-in-Chief, held a lovee at the Homse Gnards yesterday, when rather a numerous circle of officers waited on his Royal Highness. It is understood the distribution of the Victoria Cross the Order of Valour) will take plac early in the ensuing month. The precise day has lnot been decided on. Her Majesty wiMl personally av=ard the decoration to those gallant men entitled to the honour, and the earemony wiU take place on the parade in front of the Horse Guards, as was the case when the Crimean medals were dis. tributed. The steamfrigate Cyclops, 6, from the eastward, arrived at Plymouth on Mondayand siled the same day with apparatus for taking soundings in the Atlautic. The steamvessel Alban, 4, Commander de Blaquiere. and the Sprightly aud the PNgmy, fromPortsmouth,. with'a portion of the 93d Highlanders, arrived at Plvmouth on Tuesday morning, and transferred them to the Beileisle for service in China. The screw steamship Exmouth, 90, Captain Harry Eyres, and the screw steamsloop Brisk, 16, Commander Curis, from Portsmouth, arrived at Plymouth on Tuesday after. noon. There is much despatch at the Devonport dockyard in order to prepare the screw stamship St. Jean d'Acre, Cap. tain King, upon which the artisans were employed on Sun. day. All the magazijes are cliared, and it is intended to place 1,200 miles of the electric cable inbher hgld. She is to be got ready, if possible, by the next spring tide. The screw steam sloop CordeMa, 11, Commander Vernon, has been for several days.in Plymouth Sound. She made a successful trial of her engines, and it is expected that her destination will be the Red Sea, where she will be omployed,in conjunction with the Imaum of Muscat, to proteot British shipping engaged in the guano trade at the Kooria Mooria IBlands. Captain O*d, superintendent for the pro. prietors, was at Plymouth on Monday. He will shortlypro. ceed overland, so as to reach the islands by the 1st of September, which will be sufficiently early in the reason for the commencement of operations. Captain Ord will be pro. vided with a steam vesseL The toll, it is understood, will be 11. per ton to the proprietors, and 2s. 6d. per ton to the Government. Strong hopes are entertained that the Arabs will be induced to help to load the ships. The Colossus, 80 guns, screw steamship, -Captain Thomas S. Thompson, arrived at the Great Nore at 8 p.m., on Tuesday. The Malacca, 17 guns, sleam-sloop, Captain Arthur Farqubar, arrived at the Little Nore at 9 p.m. on Taesday. The ColoSsUS and Malaca bre to be dismantled and paid off at Sheerness. The Eurydlce, 26 guns, Captain John W. Tarleton, G.B., &B., snd the Mariner, 12 guns, sloop, Commander Wray . G. Palliser, are ordered to proceed to Chatham to be dismantled and paid off. The floating battery Terror, 16 guns, has been taken into No. 3 dry dock at Sheernees for the purpose of a survey being held on her. She is being rigged with all possible despatch. By a letter received from Carthagena, dated the 11th of May last, lit appears that the Orion, 91 guns, screw-steamship, Captain John B. Erakine, was that day to sail, and convey the Admiral of the West India aud. orth American station to Navy Bay. The Admiral was to proceed to Panama, where he was expected to remain a few days, after which the Orion wvas to convey him to Greytown, from thenco the Orion will convey him toBermnuda,where he i to join his flagship, the Indus, 78 guns, Captain John C. Dalrymple Hay, which ship leaves Carthagena on the same day as the Orion, and proceeds direct for Bermuda. The West India squadron is broken up, and the following vessels (says the letter) are to be sent home: "The Cossack, 20 guns, screw steam corvette, Captain James H. Cockburn, sailed for England yesterday, to be paid off; the Victor, 6 guns, screw stearm gunveasel, Commander Algernon F. R. De Horsey, leaves to-day; the Tartar, 20 guns, screw steamconvette, Captain Hugh Dunlop, has Proceeded to New York, but she is under-orders to return again in a certain number of days to Bermuda. AUl the vessels are expected to return home about the latter end of July next, or the beginning of August. The Orion, it is expected, will return home shortly after the return of the Tartar from New York." The fleet of 40 Iron barges ordered by the Board of Tiade for the service of the Turkish Government, which are under constrantion by Messrs. Westwood, Baillie, and Campbell, at Millwall, Isle of Dogs, are rapidly progressing towards completion. They are intended for dredging the Danube, in order to carry out the terms of the treaty entered into for the free navigation of that river. They are termed hopper barges, from their peculiar construction, and are well adapted for the purpose, being ftted so as to discharge their contents by means of a trap connected with the 1looring. They are 30 feet long, and carry 16 tos;,when light, they draw 15 inches of water. One of the' barges is ordered to be despatched to Woolwich Dock3ard to be tested in ths basin, to verify their efficienoj prior to the fulfilment of the builders' contract. Yesterday four 68-pounder guns, captured in the late Russian war, were forwarded from Woolwich Arsenal t3 York, Leeds, Sheffield, and Huddersfield. A number of these trophies have been despatched to the various provincial towns of the kingdom, and also to the colonies, to ba erected in the parks or other publio places of resort. Yesterday a number of hands employed in the military store department of Woolwich Arsenal, who were entitled from length of services to the superannuation fund, retired from the establishment. Most of these men had been nearly 50 years in the service. Yesterday the anuual inspeotion of the Chatham Division of Royal Marine Light Infantry took place by Major-General Lord Rokeby, L.C.B. The whole of the officers and meu of the battalion were formed in the barrack-square at 10 o'clock, and on Major-General Lord Rokeby, who was attended by Colonel Lord A. Hay, Assistant AdjutantGeneral, and Colonel S. RP Wesley, Deputy AdjutantGeneral, arriving he was received with a general salute, the band playing " Rule, Britannia." After inspecting th troops, who wero in heavy marching order, the battalion was formed into 10 companies, and, headed by Colonel E. A. Parker, the commandant, proceeded to the Grea' Lines with colours flying. Lord Rekeby having concluded the inspection of the barracks, the barrack accounts, and the sergeants' mess, visited Melville Hospital, over which he was conducted by Dr. Drummond, Deputy Inspector of Hospitals, and, having made an examination of that building, proceeded with his staff and nearly aU the field officers of the garrison to the lines, where the Marines went through a variety of evolutions and light infantry manoauvres, each man having been supplied with 15 rounds of blank cartridge. On the conclusion of the evolutions Lord Rokeby, addressing Colonel Parker and the battalion, expressed his-entire satisfaction with the result of his inspection, and paid a compliment to the commandant on the high state of discipline of the corps of Royal Marine3 under his command. Lord Rokeby and suite then left the ground to visit the batteries, where he inspected the Marine gunners in the great gun driU under Captain H. G. Connolly, the manner in which that body of men worked the guns eliciting unqualified approbation. The Royal Horse ArtiRery, under the command of Colonel Wood, were yesterday morning drawn up on Woolwich-common in field-day order. Shortly after 10 o'clock Colonel Bloomfield, Aide-de-Camp to Her Majesty, Acting-Commandant of the garrison; Brigade-Major Shaw, and the garrison Staff, in undress uniforms, accompanied by Count Von Bernstoff, the Prussian Ambassador, and Sir Culling E. Eardley, arrived on the ground and tcok up their position, when the troops commenced a series of field manceuvres, and fired 15 rounds of ammunition. At a later hour the whole of the Royal Marine force, under the command of the respective Colonels of Divisions also assembled cn Woolwich-common, and went through a course of platoon and other field drills. The quarterly ball held by the officers of the Royal Artilery garrison took place on Tuesday evening in the messroom of the establishment at Woolwich. This evening (Thursday) a grand dinner is to be given by the mess committee of the establishment to Lieutenant-Colonel R. A. Shafto Adair, Commandant of the Sufiolk Artillery Militia, and Mr. Bell, the sculptor. Major-General Sir W. F. WilliamS will preside at the en,tertainment, the object of which is to inaugurate a wvhite marble statue representing "Armed Science," presented by Colonel Shaf to Adair. The statue is cissled out of a solid block of Carrara marble. It stands 6 feet 6 inches above the pedestal, and is placed in a well eelected position, within a recess at the northern extremity of the mess-room. Th}e following regiments are held in readiness at short notice to proceed from Dublin to Cork for embarcation, the former for Ceylon and the latter for the Cape of Good Hfope :-The 50th, consisting of 36 officers and 80 men, ineluding ness-commissioned offlicers, drulmmers, and rank and file, under the command of Colo>al Richard Waddy, C.B.

HORTIQUL2!URA ~SOCIXTy. Yesterday the m.at charming of all the motropolitAn fees-the sprig glower-show of thi society-v..was, after a lapse of two years, again given at ChiAswick vdth unusual succes. The gardera wret beautiful, the attendance of rank and fashion most numerous, and nothing but more favourable weather was required to make the display equal to those days of old when the Chiswick ilower.show was par erceflence the fite clrmpgtre of the London season. but the weather-a is not unfrequently the case in Eng land-was not entirely-propitious. It sprinkled rain alittle now and then, and was always threatening much more. To a certain extent this must have indluenced the attendamce of visitors, though We ssldom recollect to have seen the gardens more crowded. Just now the Chiswice grounds form one. of Nature's flower-shows on the richest and most beautiful scale. Clumps of flowering trees, bushes of jilac, Gueddre roses, hawthorns, and laburnums are decked in all their varied blossoms, ebeekering the colour of the smooth soft turf like giant flower-beds. The very air seems heavy with their fragrance, and the light young leaves to rustie sympathetically under a flood of song which is poured unceasingly from trees and bushes. 'the cuckoos, In partioular, were busy, and their well-known notes echoed through the gardens as if ten springs had come at once. Yesterday, as the brilliant company wandered in groups among this foliage of blossoms, the effect of the scene was rich a .d glowingin' the extremet irresistibly rerminding the spectat&r of tViepictures of Wattean, or the sylvan f6tes which Boccaccio conjures up. The Devonshire-gardens, formerly so great an attraction, seem not so now. They have a weedy, desested look, like the grounds of a house to let, a nd contrast but ill with the society's gardens, which, as we have said, are the very acme of neatness and good order, and lustrons in their present beauty. The flower show was disposed yesterday under a number of extensive marquees-one of which was nearly a hundred yards iu length. A Indeed, tents and marquees quite covered one part of the gtounds, and seemed put there as if to tempt the company to rush into sylvan life, and never more return to hot'aud close apartmlaht. Mlost of the tents seemed exhibited tK show their improvement on the Ordnance Bell tent (than which nothing is easier to improve), and their applicability to campaigning purposes. All were without exception more spacious than the " regulation umbrella,'t and in most instances lighter, ccoler, cheaper, and more durable. They were exhibited by B. Edgington, of the Borough. As regards the competitors' horticultural display, we have sen better shows than that of yesterday. The roses of the unuserymen were very good; so also were the azalias, which were rich in blossoms, and looked. like piles of newlyfallen snow. Ia the first class-that of mixed stove and greenhouse plants-were somae remarkably fine specimens, and so also were there among the orchids.' The fruit was generally very good, though, eoxcept among the pines and grapes, not such as to call for any particular remark. There was a very numerous list of suceessful competitors, far too numerous, indeed, to permit of our more than mentioning the names of those who took the chief prizes in the more important classes. The recipients of the most valuable awards were some in three or more classes,-Mr. Dods, gardener to Sir J. Cathcart; Mr. Peed, gardener to Mr. Treadwell; Mr. Piluher, gardener to Mr. Rucker; Messrs. Veitoh and Sons; mr. Wooley, gardener to Mr. Kerr; Mr. Green, gardsnerto sir E9. Antrobas, Messrs. Love and Sons; Mr. Wiggins, gardener to Mr. Beech; and Alr. Tarner, of Slough. In fraitthe most successful competitors were-Mir. Davies, Mr. J. Temple, gardener to the Dowlais Iron Company; Messrs. Spary and Campbell; and Mr. Iveson, gardener to tihe Duke of Northumberland. The highest prizes awarded 'were 207., with the option given to the competitors to exchange the money award for medals at the rate of 151. or the large gold medal, 101. or the Knightian medal, 71. or the Banksian medal, and so on. The bands of the Grenadier, Coldastream, and Life Guards were in attendance in the gardens during the day, and materially contributed to the animation of the scene by their performances. Towards the close the three bands were united, and the effect produced was must powerfuL
GOvERIMnrNT EMGRATIox.-PLYMo3Tnr, Wednesday.-Sir F. Rogers, one of the Commissioners for Emigration, and Mr. Walcot, seoretary, paid an official visit to this port on Monday, chiefly for the Purpose of inspecting the new ship Undaunted, Captain Frinklyn, belonging to the Australian Screw Steam Clipper Company, now at anchor fn the Sound. From long experience it has been found that wbile crossing the Equator in sailing ships, especially when calms prevail, more sickness occurs among female emigrants and more deaths among children than during any other part of the voyage. To obviate this evil an experiment is to be tried with a clipper steamer carrying sufficient fuel to propel her in' and out of harbour andthrobgh the caWis titud6s, where, it steatning only and evena j ta; low 'rate, sufficient, ventilation will be created to decrease. materially the probabilities of sickness and of death. After inspeetingthe capacious dep6t on Lambhay-pqiht, onthe border of the Sound, and witnessing the mode of despatching the first iaetachment of emigrants, Sir F. Rogers, Ie. WMlcot5 and Mr. J. B. Wilcocks, the resident agents proceeded with the sedond detachment in the tug to the Undaunted. She- is a teak-built ship, 1,426 tons builder's measurement, and 1,091 tons register, omit-. ting the engine space; her length is 230 feet over all, breadth 39 feet, and deDth 23 feet. The engines, by Thompson and Wood, are 106.horse power nominal, working up to 380 horses. Including studding sails, she can r about 8,000 yards of canvass, her mainyard being 80 feet long, topsail 69 feet, topgallant 55 feet, and royal 40 feet, The Undaunted has about 300 tons of general cargo, and is engagec to convey to Melbourne about 370 statute adults, comprising 260 single women, 50 married couples, and 18 single men, all of -whom wi'l be accommodated in her 'tween decks, which are full eight feet high, capacious, and well ventilated. She ta es a condensing apparatus capable of distilling 450gallons per diem, which will be tested by Captain Patsy, R.N., the Government inspector of passenger ships. The possession of this apparatus relieves the owners from the necessity of conveying so large a quantity of water-a concession granted by order in Council on the 6th inst. The commissioners expressed their entire satisfaction with the ship and her equipment. The emigrant fittin'gs are so contrived as to be readly converted into second-class berths on the voyage home, when the Undaunted, which has a suitable saloon, ladies' cabin, &c, will commence her duties on the line as a passenger ship in conjunction withe screw steamship Istanboul, which returned from Melbourne on the 19th of May, the Indomitable, which sailed hence on the 5th of January, and the Kfing Philip, which departed on the 28th THE POLICE AND PU1BLIC MORALS.-IyVrPOOL, JTune 3.-At the meeting of the Liverpool Town Council today a proposal was made by the Lighting and Watching Committee that an addition of 50 men should be made to the police force. Mr. J. B. Braucker, the chairman of the committee, in moving the confirmation of the proceedings, said that unfortunately the great increase of property in the town brought with it also a great increase of crirme, and it was therefore necessary to increase the force in the borough, Mr. Kitchen, Chairman of the Gas Supply Committee, contended that an increase in the number of street lamps would be far more conducive to pubhc morality than a mere addition to the police force. Alderman Samuel Holme said he would have hesitated sanctioning an addition to the police force, which would involve an increased coet to the ratepayers of 3,0001. per year, if he were not aware of the great immorality which was prevalent in Liverpool, and which even exceeded that of London. For instance, the number of drunk and disorderly persons apprehended in London yearly was 5,035 males and 4,539 females; total 9,574 persons, in a population of '2,646,000; while in Liverpool, with a population of only 423,000, the drank and disorderlies apprehended yearly was 4,726 males and 4,249 females, a total of 8,975 persons, or a difference between Lendon and Liverpool of only 599. Itwas true that in London the number of police was .5,813, or one to 455 of the population, while in Liverpool the force numbered 886, or only one to 477 of the population, but this slight difference in favour of London could not satisfactorily account for the great difference in the public morality. ln Liverpool they had a new gaol built to accomraodate 1,000 prisoners, and it has now 1,200 prisoners confined in its cells, andin consequence they had beencompolled to abandon the separate system, under which the gaol was established. He attributed the immorality of Liverpool in a great measure to the number of those pests of society-the singing and dancing saloons-which were open at all hours of the night, as were also numerous publichouses in. the neighbourhood of the theatres and docks. He invited any gentleman to acoompany him on a vit to these places, over which the police had very little, control, as he felt assured that they woald be surprised at the character of the persons who were to be, found there. He believed that if young men were aware that such places were liable to be visied at any time by a numben of their employers they would be very unwilling to meet their masters there, and would consequenUtly be very seldom. induced to visit them. Atthe same time hefolly believed that an increase of the police force was necessary in consequence of their docks being entirely open to the public, and Liverpoot being the greatrpori ofembareation for enigrants who lest this country, and. who wew pe. liarly lixble to be preyed UOn by the orhisanals of all oles who infested the town. Mr. J. B. Je&bry (ox* of the proprietors of Compton-banse, a very large draDe#y establishment), said he fully apparoed of the suggestion semde by Alderman Holme, and had already acted adpen it himself. He had visited several of the plaees refersed.ta himself, and was exceedingly surprisest 5.t ecene of the persons whoinhe foud there.

BY M-ISTAEE.-A shocking occurrence has happened at Worcester, arising out of the sale and application of arsenic in mistake for wnite lead, which has eccasioned the death of a child, the ofispring of a greengrocer, named Norman, who died on Saturday, and the cause of whose death was the subject of a coroner's inquisition, which, after an adjournment, terminated on Tuesday night.- The circumstances are as follow:-Six weeks ago the child, who was healthy, was born, and the mother, who had been in the habit of using white lead to dust certain portions of her infants' bodies (the ordinary practice in nursing), sent to the-shop of a druggist named atringer, living in one of the urmcipal streets of the town, for a pennyworth of white lead. The messenger, the hild's own brother, was served by an apprentice named Bvans with a white powder having the appearance of white lead, which was applied, but which caused excessive irritation of the skin. Some nmore was sent for, and this time Mr. Strnger himself served the arcle from the same drawer. The irritating effects of the powder continued to increase, however, a wound formed, and the child died in great pain. Mr. H. Bell, surgeon believing that something deleterious had got into the powder, caused inquiry to be made, and on Air. Stringer closely ens anuinining the white powder in the drawer from which he had Eold the quantity to the family of the Normaans he made: the fearful discovery that it was arsenic. Arsenic, when applied externaUy under such circumstances, was, according to, the evidence of the medical man, intensely corrosive. The ehild had died of a slow burning, and musth5aesufferedfearfully. It is only to be hoped that no other calamity may aris. out of this fatal mistake, bat it seems that the drawer had been filled some weeks with the irritant poison. The eirouinstanees under which the drawer was illed were as follows :- Mr. Stringer keeps his nedicals in a cellar, to which Ms apprentices nave access. The arsenic inbulk was keptthere, and also the white lead, both in barrels of somewbat similar appearance. Some weeks ago Mr. Stringer's yourstanprentice, a lad named Hennes, who had not been appreinb ced to the busiss four months. seeing the white lead drawer empty, and thiiking it to be his duty to fill it, did, actually fill it with arsenic from the barrel in twe cellar,. mistaking it for white lead. The boy states that there was no label *' senic' on the drawer, bat this Mr. Stinger contradicts. The unfortunate affair Xas caused a greab deal of excitement in te town. The coroner, MIr.

The house of Xyng and Co. applied to his Excellency the Superior - Cvil Governor, Captaifi.% neral and Superintendent of Finance, requesting such-ex. -elusive privilege for-a certain term, and presentinga sauip of the substance in question, submitting that they had etablished a right to claim that oran equivalent reward fr'tlie information which mnight be conceded without prejudioeto the State, sincee fromn the before-mentioned C&3 os alone is -much as 150,000 tons iight be annuakly extracted. . l "As it may naturallye presumed, our supremeauthority gave immediate orders that the sample of guano should be analyzed, committing tlis task to the care of the intelligext director of the Laboratory of Chvmical Invesition. Those who are aoquainted with e activty and sciestific attainments of that di*tinWmuishe&professor il not be surprised to lean that this commission was promptlj and conscientionsly performed. Although the anilsis did not furnish results entirely conformable to the qualities which had been' attributed to the sample of gnan,o submitted, it, on the other hand; g*sa othtrs more than sufficiently .satisfactory and valuable to render it hi;oly advisable to contniue the investigation; for, although no guano equal to that of Peru had been found, atiU the subs;tnce wnich had been examisnid possessed qualities, as-a manure, of an exceedingly valuable nature, which woiuld render its employment in our agriculture highly pro. fitAle and even afford ample returns to the exchequer by the grabting licenses for its exportation, which would not have -been so earnestly sought for withodt well-groundedreasons1or countingupon a profitable return. "The sample submitted to examination was a substsnce which, taking the result of its qualitative analysis, Vwa found to contain sulphate of lime or gypsum, traces of salt, or chloride of sodium, phosphate of lime with oxide of iron. carbonate of lime wiith indications of magnesia, siiaca amid silicate of iron, vegetable organic matter and water coeibined; thequantitativeanalysisshowingthat the sulphate of lime and the traces of salt entered into its coD,position in the proportion of 40 parts in the 10) the phosphate of l;me 20 parts, the carbonate of lime 12, the silica and silicate of iron 2, organic vegetable matter 6, and water and loss 20 parts. Mr. Casaseca very justly called attention to the comparison of this analvsis with that of the guaDo of Peru, from which the saraple examined materially differed, since the latter contained neither uric acid, urate of ammonis, or ammoniacal salts. While the :-sverseqsiaieulbsfV ev -unsplen sulphate. of line, -.be sample analyzed contained no less th*n 40 pei cent. of tattsubstfnce; it beingto he observed th4t no guano hithertolexamined had yet fuinished gypsum, on tvwibhnccouDnrMr. Cisase6a consideied himself anthorized in termingita calcareous stone.: "But Mr. C,saaca WAs notwithstanding of opinuthet jthissubstance was to be considered as a nainera nmanuref gacat utilty, on account of the lirge quantity oE gypsum it ceontained, and to ahigh degree valuable in particular-descriptions of cultivation, no less than on account of the remarkable proportion it contained of phosphxte of lime one of the beat mineral manures known. Re was -of opinion, therefore, as oe have already stated, that the subject was a mnatter cslwing for thorough investigation; and this accordingly is the object with which the commissi6rs appointed has set out on its voyage, accomapanied by the beforenmentioned Captain Green, seut by the firm of lyng and Company. " The commission left Batabano on the 6th; on the 7th the steamer arrived, conveying it nearly as far as the extremity of the Rosario Channel, and anchoring near the Cantiles Cayo, This cayo was examined, and an abundanee of wvhite gnano, similar to that sold in the United States as Mexican guano, was found upon it. On the 8th the Eoeario, Cayo was examined, and on the 9th the Pasages Cave,, upon which was found guano equal to that of the CantiRes. On the lth, after going in the direction of the Largo Cayo, their explorations were continued with various results, but they had found on some islets in sight of the said cayo an immense number of birds and a considerable quantity of guano. " On the llth,directing theircourse along the south ofthTe Largo reef and cayo towarda the Ballenatos Cayos, they found upon the larger one to the east some guano of superior quality. On the 12th, at daybreak, the steamer went in-a ection E. by S. of the Irgo Cayo, and visited some cayos which they had not examined on the 10th, meeting with a dark-coloured guano, and upon one of them so immense an assemblage of birds that the very 'suawaos darkened by them e the soil of this cayo was covered -with eggs, it'being calculated there were as many as a deae to every square yard The guano appeared to beabundant,aid of e xcellent quality.

Sosse at least of these samples, which we have had the pleasure of inspecting, must dier considerably from that previously analyzed by Ar.

" The samples have now been since-Tuesday last in the hands of -Mr. Casaseca, vith the view of his making new analyses ofthe sarme so that the de,initive results by which we are to abide cannot he long in being made known.

FOREIGN2 lNZT=IGBNCz. FRANCE. V- (A porton of tJie fOllowing appenred in our imond tai. Mion of vesteidav :-R (FROM OU OWN COORRPONDENT.) PARIS, TUFSDAY, Juvz 2, 6 p.,. This evening, in all probability, will be decided the question of the Republican candidates coming forward at the approaching elections. Of General Cavaignac's persistence in his resolution not to present himself I can say nothing new, but it is pretty certain that x. Havin, the principal editor of the $cWe, will be proposed as a candidate in the third arrondissement of Paris. The question of taking the oath of allegiance is still under discussion. The Ministerial circular on the elections is stiU commented upon in the pres. The &Si has the following remarks on it:- " We wMll neither examine nor comment on the circuia, cf the Mlinister of the Interior in its political point ef view, but it is our duty to throw lght on all that refers in the official document to the elections. A free and loyal vote is requested from all the electors. Govern. mnent will propose candidates to the electors in the same 3manner that it proposes laws to the Deputies. In opposition to these candidates other candidates may freely ,present themseves. Durlng the electoral perlod-that is, from the present moment-every candidato who shall have submitted to the examination of the legal courts a signed copy of his circulers, profesion of faith, or voting bulletMtu will enjoy perfect liberty of posting them or of distrhating them witbout other authorization. Every elector wil be permitted to write his vote or to cause it to Iba written. Finally, every elector who may wish to canvass wiU be permitted to distribute bulletisa frly, provided the signature of the candidate on one of t.hes bulletins legaUy submitted to approval gives conzent to that stp. We do not discuss thesa conditions, wilch we should have preferred more liberal ' we merely iake note of them. But the Minister-and this 'we believe to be a hiatus-does not say to which court ofjudicature &arque) the bulletin and other documents must he sub- I iitted. Is it the court of the chief town of the arrondissament, or does it result from the silence of the circular that the candidate and the elector enroy the choice of the court, for there are localities possessing several of the latter? We hope that the Minister will reply to the question we have the honour of submitting to him, and which interests nlike the electors and the candidates." The following are the views of tho Pakre "It is impossible not to recognie In the instructions so elearly laid down by the Ministerial circular the mot ample nnd loyal precepts of electoral freedom. Whrst more can those journals demand who propagate the mno d'ordre of abstaining ? Clubs, perhaps ? But even the SWe does not regrot the absence of the latter. Who would render it the service of opening them after it had the couage to close them in 1848 with the sword of GeneralCavaignac? Under no rule, at no opoch, has the poll been so accessible to Eerious and legal candidates as now. The present Government, like all those who have preceded it, has its preferences; but, instead of imposing them by oorruption, as has been seen, it merely affords them the moral and public support of its confidence. In times when the electors of a diict were sometimes less than 300 nefarious means mlght beadoptefd to influence the election, but corruption and inti' zidation areshatteredaogainat universal suffrage. Whonentire districts vote for the candidate of Government they obey 3neither an interest nor force, they simply manifes their con. fidnceintheGovernmentoetheEmperor,whichtheyfounded, aud which they wish to maintain, because it responds to all zheir instincts of order, glory, and progress; because, in. stead of being the Government of a caste or of a party, it is the Government of everybody; and beoause its polioy, like its origin, represents what is most legitimate in society and mnost national in the country and in history. Such is the general signification of the circular of thoe Ministr of the Interior." The Gazette de France says t" It is, therefore, well understood that candidates must submit their profession of faith to the parquet before pre. senting themselves to the electors. What vwe fall to comprehend is that the Minister subsequently admits as a supposition that a protest ' against our institutions' can be offered. It would seem that the precautions to which candidates and electors are submitted take away all possibility of unymanifestation by means of voting. The Minister an' nounces that the prefects will receive new instruotlons shortly. There is reason to hope that this ulterior doomeat will explain what it means by a 'seditious protest Dgainat our institutions' in the matter of the elections." The following is from the Presse: " A doubt is excited in our minds by this circular, and ve take the liberty of expressing it. Is it absolutely necessary to belong to a hostile party in order to vote against the official candidate? Cannot, for example, local objections and, difficulties arise totally independent of pary spirit? This manner of constituting an Opposition is not that of the English. In England the Opposition, let it be Tory, Whig, or Radical, is called, and calls itself, Her kIesty's Opposition." An incident of rather a strange character, and which has produced a painful impression among the Italian refugees in Paris, occurred a week or two ago. One of the most eminent of the Italian patriots, and who behaved with remarkable courage during the bombardment of Venice-M. Joseph Sirtori, suddenly disappeared about the 13th of May last. M. Sirtori is, it seems, a decided antiMuratist, and not long before the date mentioned had rather a stormy discussion with three Italian gentlemen, also refugees-namely, MM. Antonelli, Salicetti, and. Maestri, who are, I believe, warm partisans of Prince Murat. M. Sirtori's friends were aturally surprised, at his sudden and unaccountable disappearance, and made every effort to discover the place of his concealment. For some time these efforts were fruitless. After 11 days spent in much exertion and anxiety, they discovered that M. Sirtori had been shut up in the lunatic asylum of Bictre, where it was impossible for him to communicate with any one outside. The moment this fact was discovered his friends addressed themselves to the authorities, and on their demand he was at once restored to liberty. A medical certificate deelared that there was nothing the matter with him. Nevertheless, I am informed he -was subjected to the restraint of a straitwaistcoat for three days. The explanations were, I believe, that a mistake on the part of a sergent-de-ville led to his confinement. Kn some cases such violence would be likely to cause isanity. M. Sirtori bore the outrage committed on him with calm self-possession. The affair has ,been a good deal talked of among the Italians. The King of Bavaria, accompanied by Count Charles Tascher de la Pagerie, yesterday morning visited the gallery of modern pictures at the Luxembourg, as well as the palace and gardens. In the afternoon His Majesty went to Malmaison to visit Queen Christina, and in the evening dined with Count Walewski, Minister of Foreign Affairs. The camp which is to be formed at Chal6ns-surMarne in the month of September next, and which -will last for two months, will consist of 25,000 men. The Emperor has ordered a Swiss ohalet to be consatruicted for his use, as he intends commanding the camp in person, and of course superintending the 3manceuvres. The intermediate time between this and September will be spent between St. Cloud, Plombiares, and perhaps Biarritz, though about this last there is some uncertainty. It is said that the Emperor's health requires as much repose as possible from business, as from pleasure. It is reported that M,de Dreux Breze, the Bishop of Moulins, whose treatment of his priests made so much noise some time since, is aboout to pay a visit to Italy, which will keep him from his diocess about thlree months. Lord Brougham left Paris this moming for London. He was present yesterday at the meeting of the scientific section of the Institute, and read a paper of great research and interest " On Paradoxes imputed to the Integral Calculw." T?he review took pilace, as announced, this day at Longohamps, in the Bois de Boulogne. Nt was proposed to postpone or transfer it to some other spot on account of the injury done to the ground.

ALGERIA. The Moniteur publishes the second portion of the report of the Minister of War on the present state of Algeria. The following are the principal points of the document now published:- "It begins by pointing out the present state of agrioulture in that colony. The report states that from all the information colleoted the natives are more than ever turn. ing their attention to agrioultural pursuits, and this fact is proved by the statistical accounts of the quantty of ground under cultivation. In 1855 the number of hetares (2 acres each) sown in the provinces of Algiers, Oran, and Constantina was 1,765,071; and in 1856, 2,082,524, showing an increase of 347,453 hect3res. Notwithstanding this in-' cresse in extent, the Arabs have not made so much improvement as could be wished in their system of culti. vation. The report points out the necessity of something being done, in order to give to the Arabs a gua rantee for the possession of the soil on which they labour, as considerable uneasines is felt by them on that sub. ject. They fear that as colonization by Eruropeans advances they shall be dispossessed of the ground they now hold. These difficulties are being progressively removed by the system of cantonment of the tribes. The object ofi this plan Is to fix in a definitive manner. tha extent of ground which is necessary for the Arabs to live on, taldng into account their present means of cultivation and their agricultrl habits. Hlitherto the Arabs have occupied more ground than was necess for them, as, in taking into account the number of hectares and of the inhabitants, they had at the rate of one heoturo for each person. The report then goes on to state that, although thlis system of cantonment will be a rather complicated one, it will be, when carried Into effect, one of get utility. When the rab, It says, Al"I be secure of tho possession of the ground he occuples he will mo readily renounce his wandering habits, wil endeavour to imitate Europon habits of agriculture, and by degrees adopt those which he finds superior to his Own.") The report next alludes to the result which have been already obtained for the imnprovement of the breed of horses nAgra nwihA remarks :- nAgra nwihi "The attempts of the Government in this direction date from the Government of Marshal the Duke d'Iyliy; but the greatest impulse has been given under that of the present Governor-GeneraL The creation of dep6ts of stallions either belonging to the State or to the tribes, the esablishment of races at the pricipal towns of the three provinces, aud the granting of premiums for the best hores produced, have been attended with the best effects. The 1ns compotition for premiums shows in the fUlest manner the great improvement which has taken pl.ce, and the valuable resources which France may draw from Algeria for remoLuting her light cavalry." The report then states that Marshal Randon has turned his attention to the improvement of the breed of sheep - "For that purpose, it says, a model ilock was formed from choice ows of the native breeds, among which were introducred a certain nuamber of merino rams. The resut of this attempt caunot fail In a feyears to be attended with the best advantages." The report then alludes to the attention which has been devoted by the Government to the question of the divlsion of taxe3 among the Arabs:- " At the period which immediately followed the submission of the tribes their distance from the centres of command caused conaiderable diffioulty in the coltection, bit thst was got over by the matter being placed in the hands of the native chief4, by whom it was carried on under every desirable guarantee. An idea of the success attending the plans adopted for the division of the taxes to be paid by the natives and the mode of collection nay be formed from the fac that the sums received in the three provinces in 1856 amounted to 13,518,656f., being an increase on 1855 of 2,538,268f. 'INotwithstanding tlds sucoes%,' says the report, ' the rules of taxation require still further improvement, and the question is now under consideration by the Consultative Committee of Algeril."' The report also alludes to the different publioworka which have been executed for the benefit of the colony, and particularly mentions the artesian wells which have been dug, and by which parts of the country which were formerly comparatively barren for want of water have been now rendered luxuriant. The report then refers to public instruction, and says:- "In what are caZled the military territo0les primary instruction has remained stationary, but at Algiers, Constantina, Bona, Bliclah, Mostaganem5 and Tlemoaen, in the civil territories, a certain number of Muaulman schools for Arab and French instruction have, in execution of the decree of the 14th of July, 1850, been established, and are regulrly attended by about 1,200 pupils of both sexes In Algiers in particular, at the end of last year, the number of Kussulman school increased to four, and thelr pupils to about 450. Not content with what has been done for instruction, efforts have been made to moralize the rising Arab generation, by developing in it a tast for honest industry; and accordingly susof money are to be given to European workmen who will receive Arab children from the schools as apprentices. A native school has been established at Algiers, and female children are taught the art of sewing." Mith respecb to public aSsistance the report says : "Large sums (in Agiers alone they amount to 85,OO0f.) are given to Arabs in distress, and hospitals have been established for the reception of incurable and aged persons. It is proposed, also, to sot apart special wards for the natives in the civil hospitals, to organize bureaux de bienfaisance, and to establish cheap kitchens, &c. It then detils the measures that have been adopted for placing under control and surveillance the floating Arab population of towns. This population, It appears, goes by the name of 'Berrans,' and consists of Aaabs from Kabylia, Biskra, Laghouat, the the oasis of the Beni-hizab, and even the centre of Africa; and when working in the towns the persons composing ik are accuDtomed, in order to economize as muoh money as possible, to abstain from taking any fixed residence, and to pass the night in caf4s, bazaars, or under the arcades of pub' lie buildings." The report concludes as follows " Thus, in whatever way I consider Algeria as regards itg native population, I have nothing but improvement to announce to your Majesty. The country in a state of tranquillity, roads in course of constraction, increaae of cultiva. tion, public works in progress, crimes and transgressions diminishing, the Arab population more inolined to obedlenos -every day, I may say, rewards our efforts with fresh suM cess. Our moral influence even extends beyond our sphere of action. Have we not this year seen the chiefs of various tribes disseminated alone the route of Soudan, whore they chiefly live by plunder, who, moved by what they had heard in their distant country, camne to Algiers in order to convince themselves with their own eyes of the truth of the narratives which, brought over to their desert solitudes, had pictured to them the glory and power of France? On leaving, they engaged to second the efforts we are about to make in order to open a commmercial intercourse with the kingdoms of Timbuctoo And 'Hacuses. The arival at Algiers of the Tooareg chiefs is, in my opinion, the most convincing proof of the respect which the French name Commands among the native pOpulations. There still rains much to be done, no doubt, in order completely to attach the Arabs to French civilization. But are not the results we have obtained a pledge for the future? In ao delicate a task the most dfiutpar was to surmont teatptyo c n religiousjealousy. All wouldthave heen endangered had welistenedto the unreflecting impatience of those who wanted, without any transition, and by sheer force, to bring the natives under the rule of the la"s and customs of France. We have found the means of rendering success certain, by letting time and private interest play the principal part in this transformation of the Arab race. Il is our duty now to enter more fully Into the course which the experience of the last few years haa taught us to be th, best." BELGIUM.

BERLIN, JuNm I. Thi summer and autumn promise to be unusaUy prolific of religiou-s meetings and church assemblies throughout Protestait Germany, affording satisfactory evidence to the numerous chainpions of our fidth at home that the example which England has so long been setting in the field of religious activity has been by no means lest. In addition to the numerous provincial synods and pastoral conferences which are alwrays held at this time of the year, there will this summer be a German Evangelical conference held at isenach, a synaod at Dresden, an assembly of the Moravian brothers and sisters from all pairs of the world at Herrenhut (the seat al i fountain-head of this denomiation, in Saxony); the Evangelieal Ecclesiastical Diet (Kirchentag) at Stuttgard; a Conference of Baptists at Hamburg; and last, but far from least, the Assembly of the Evangelical Alliance, to be held here, in Belin, in the month of September. In addition to< thb6e meetings in the North of Germany may be mentioned also an assembly about to be held in Copenhagen of Evangelical Christias in Denmarkr, Sweden, and Norway, with a view to eonsolidate the union of Scandinavian Protestants irrespectively of the dilerences which exist in doctrine and discipline between the churches of the three gsndina-viau kingdoms. It is the approaching meeting of the Evangelical Alliance in Berlin which will chiefly interest your readers, inasmuch as, apart from its general attraction as a means of uniting the Protestants of England, Germany, and the rest of the world in the common bond of brotherhood, the meeting itself is being brought about mainly throuah the co-operation of the British branch of the Alliance with the Berlin Association, which was originally called into life by the example set in England 12 years back. The promise of co-operation oa the part of the British branch ox theAlliance inducea the prominent leaders of the German Aociation at the end of last year to issue a general invitation to Evangelical Christians to meet at Berlin this autumn; the extent to which that invitation hua beea responded in Great Britain and Ireland constih tutes that response a naional one; and the extent to which that British address has already bee3i joined in by the various Protestant churches ani denominations of Europefairly entitlesthat accession to be styled Buropan. The British addreasin reply to theGerman invitation hadup to the end of March last received 2,422 sIipatures, incdudinga large number of Members of Parliament; and distinguished men of the military and learned professions, bankers and merchants, Churchmen and Dissenters, bishops, deans, rectors, curates, and ministers of all denominations, are there in ample proportions; and .before the end of the following month 12 bishop3, headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, had expressed in a separate letter their warm sympathy and " hearty prayer that God may ble the Berlin Asembly, as the means of drawing more closely together the faithful Christiam of England and the continent." The British address, cauing attention to and baeking the German Invitation, has been rasponded to by assurances of sympathy and promises of co-operation fromthe variousbranches ofthoEvaugelical Alliance in France, :Belgium, Switzerland, Piedmont, Baden, Denmark, Sweden, Holland, and Bavaria. From Russia and Turkey, the confines of Europe on the East, and from the United States of America, far beyond the confines of Earope on the West, co-operation and assistance are confidently expected. Such being the extensive scope of this coming Assembly of the EI:vangelical Alliance in Berlin, and such being the extensive interest takeu in it by the religious world in England, I believe I shall only be doing my duty if I draw attention to some circumstances conected w.itthis movement which constitute diffieultiea to be overcome or dangers to be avoided in carrying out the great design. The King has seconded the general invitation t, Evangelical Christendom to meet in Berlin by the expression of his entire sanction and approval of the plan, and by assigning for the use of the assembly the Garrison Church, the largest and most appropriate building for the purpose, in which the Kirchentag, or Ecclesiastical Diet, was held four years back. He will also, as I lately had occasion to state in one of my letters, doubtless take care that no hostile official interference shall take plawe with the meeting to mar the development of the movement, and, so far as in him lies, will give it the benefit of his countenance. But it must be borne in mind that the King is as yet the only influential ally the Evangelical Alliance can number in Prussia; and he is, from his very position, prevented from taking an active aud open part in furthering their views; beyond the simply permisslve snd approving steps he has already taken he cannot go. The list of the Prassians who have signed the German invitation ineludes, It is true, the names of many enlightened, liberal, and energetic men in all profemions; their overt act in gning this document and in taking part in the subsequent transactioIs of the Asserahb1 y will also be accompanied by the sympathies of very many secret well-wishers to the cause; but their force altogether is but a puny David compared to tha brawFny Goliath of bureaucracy the cause wfill haveI to contend with. How it comes to pass that this lay element in the State is likely to offer so much opposition, whether active or inort, to the expansion of the Evangelical Alliance in Prussa,and generaUy in Germany, I must reserve for another letter to explain, as it would lead me too far for the limits of the present one. The part which the King has already taken, and the degree of sympathy he has already shown towards the Evangelical Alliance, give him a claim to expet that nothing wfi be introduced by the Assembly into its programme or its transactions that shall compromise him with the neighbouring Monarchs or with the members of his own Admi nistration. Not only muatthe Assembly refrainfromn all aggressive attacks on the Roman Catholics in Prusia-of whom the King has 6,500,000 subjects, and whose churches and schools are equally under his Minister of Public Worship as regards externals-but also from all attacks upon that church at all, inasmuch as it would form just e4fase of com- plaint to the Governments of Austria, France, aud Belgium. For the same reason it must abstain from instituting any specilE Of propdi among the Protsants of the neighbouring ounremforthe Governments of both Rusia and Austria look already with a very jealous eye upon the ampunt of sym. y felt by their Protestant subjects for tgh oief PrOtautt PoWrr of Germany; the Protes- tantd of Hungary and Bohemia would become a soure of increased solicitude to Austria if Prussia were in any way to favour their separatism in religion, which is c.oincident with their separate nationality-the very distinction the Austrian Government is striving to extinguish; and the Protestants of the Russian Baltic provinces and Finland would rouse the jealousy and suspicion of the Greek Church in Rassia, if they in any way responded to any exhibition of Protestant brotherhood made i. Prussia. Among the Protestant population of the Russian Baltic provinces the King of Prussia does already enjoy a considerable amount of influence, owing to his readiness to assist all Protestaut communities there in the erection of churches and schools, in presenting them with communion-plate and altar-pieces, &c.; but as long as these sympathies take no overt or popular form the Greek Church feels itself safe, backed as it is by so many and asvere laws for repressing Protestantism and furthering its own Cmro-Papacy. Any additional attraction offered to these Protestant spirits by Prussia would, however, give the Church authority-which in Russia is identical with the civil power-just cause of offenee; and the agitation of the national mind in Russia is, moreover, just now one that no neighbouring Monarch can wish to see further excitei. NAPLES. (mom a oWN ooNzXM2MW .) NAPLES, M&Y 28. It is not for me to judge the motives or oondemna the opinions of others, bat where all are uimted in aying that darkness reigns, the part of prudence, justice, and huminity seems to me to be rather to show how great is that darkness than to attempt. to paint it one shade less. An individual, whoever he may be, will gain little by an attempt to show' that he is not quite jet black, while the victims' of his cruelty, or ignorance, or insouciance, whoever they mav be-for I speak in the abstract,-vwill 'have their sufferings prolonged' and increased by iuch a perverted sympathy. Tho impulse of humanity, too, seems to- me rather to 'compel 'men ' o expose admitted evils than to hush them up with the imbecile lullaby of " they are not-quite so badi as they might be or are said to be." 'I cannot thu : cradle the evils of this nhappy eountr'; theivhle: truth I must give as far as I know it. The reent visit to Montesarchbo hamimch9ccpied my atten--- tion, les on account of any particular importance attaching to it than onaccountof the diplomatc in portanoe which has been given to the condition of the prisoners who occupythit castle. One word a4. to that isit. Preparation, of couse,mwas mad for it as it was' a premeditated visit and. known some days beforehand. It was stated, aud 'tuthfully, thit for about a month the treatment had been improved in consequence of a change li the officials. The Inspector of Police in particularj Signor Madia, was said to be mild though just in the performance of his duties. Since the aforesaid visit I have been informed that Madia has been removed, and has been replaced by the former Inspector, Giannette. Madia has served the purpose for whichhe was appointed. I believe-myinforima. tion tobe tre; if false, I am ready to correct it. But great and indisputable as have been the cruelties whichthe prisoners of Montsarchio have suffered, it 'has been a great mistake to make them of the highest diplomatio importance, ar if they were the great malady wherein were concentrated all the malignant humours of the social body; first, becauws in Ventotene, San Stefano, and Procida, from which I have reports, not to speak of mauny other places, much more savage cruelties have been perpetrated; secondly, becaWuse even if they wfere suspended, and the prisoners set at liberty, the active causes of those barbarities wvould remain thb same, and the real position of the country be un.changed. Instead, therefore, of requiring a general political amnesty, which does nothing more than place a certin number of unhappy personsa outside instead of inside their private walb, with the chance of being swept off again on the occurrence of any .panic, a general reform of the system of governmeut should be demanded, with substantial guarantees. Words and promies and even oaths inpxaple3 are of no force. It is no calumny to Eay so, for it is a matter of history. My last informed you that at the Government press they were printing ecclesiastical decree, which were kept secret with the profoundest inystery. I am now informed that a series of Royal reecripts, on the recommendation of the Ecelesi, astical Commission, were signed on the 18th and 20th of the month. They have not been published nor despatched as yet, but will be sent in the form of a circular to the bishops. Of the details I cannot speak, but in general it may be said that they destroy that equilibrium which was previously maintained between the Church and the State. The former has gained an immense victory; it could not e otherwise than tShat Naples should follow in the traces of Vienna. I have some more precise details to give you regarding the assassins of poor Mr. Blandfordc Te man who received the b ow which Mr. Blandford inflicted In self-defence was released by the terms of the thieves' amnesty. Since that time he has committed 10 robberies with aggression; and all this time Poerio, Pirusti (a cripple), Schiavoni (nearly blind) and others, men of birth and scholars, have been pining with chains round their legs. Well, the assain has confessed that on that night he, together with his two companuions, had made an appointment with a Custom-house officer to Teceive or send off some contraband goods at Pie di Grotto. Ongoing to the place at the time appointed no officer was there, but greater precautions than usual were adopted, and they beat a retreat. On their road back they met Blandford, and assaulted and killed him. On Monday evening the officers of Her Majeaty's steam corvette Centaur, Captain Clifford, gave a brilliant ball to the residents and visitors at Naples in honour of our Sovereign's birthday. The dancing was kept up till a late hour, and the gaieties of the evening were greatly enhanced by the hearty courtesy of the gaUant hosts.

MADRID, MAY 29. The hopes of an amicable and speedy adjustment of the quarrel between Spain and Mexico, which were founded on the arrival at Madrid of Senor Lafragua, the authorized negotiator on behalf of the country last named, have not as yet advanced much towards a realization, and, upon the whole, I fear the state of the affair cannot be considered satisfactory. Little or nothing of what has passed between Senor Lafragua and Senor Pidal has come to the knowledge of the Madrid public, but a portion of the press, and especially the Espana newspaper, has made itself remarkable by its unfriendly inuendoes and exaggerated pretensions, calculated to envenom the question and increase its difficulty of settlement. The motives of these journals for adopting this unusual, uncaUed for, and unpatriotic courseunpatriotic because i tends to and provokes a war with Mexico, from wvhich Spain could derive no possible benefit worth the naming, while such a conflict would assuredly expose her to great risk and loss-may easily be conjectured; but it is more interesting and important to remark that the Ministerial papers have taken exceedingly little trouble to counteract the effects of perfidious insinuations and exaggerated estimates of the satisfaction due from Mexico to Spain. 1 am enabled to give you, in a brief compass, an exact sketch of the present state of the HispanoMIexican question, as it stands up to this very morning. In the, first place, it is much to be regretted that Senor Lafragaa did not think it in accordance with his instructions to come at once to Madrid instead of lingering in Paris. Its poseible, and even probable that the difficulty might then have been settled before the meeting of the Cortes. Now the feeling in both Chambers is such ax to render its pacific arrangement much more doubtfu]. And, besides this, the progress made by the negotiators-as I presume we may term them, although the MexicanEnvoy be notofficially receivedSenor Lafragua and the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, has been hitherto extremely slow. The English and French Ministers here have spared no effort to remove difficulties, smooth away asperities, amd inspire both parties with mutual confidence; but Ihitherto very little progreus has been made towards a solution of the question. The Spanish Government demands, certainly not without rearon, the signal pmuishment of the rob^ bee and assassins of CuernaYaca. The Mexican i egotiator, it is aid, pledges himself tat f ihall h-e done that it is pomsible to do. here the Spaniih Government shows -itself unresoaa is m fusing to renew diplomatic relations until the punishment shall have been actually inflicted EpSa is of those whose sufferings do not teach then mercy. She should reme)uber the forbearance that has so frequently, within the last 20 years, been sbown to her, feeble and distracted. How often within that period, have her promises to do her best been accepted as current coin? Hlow often have in. ternal circumstances and political convulsions been pleaded-by her 'to other Powers as ar9rmenta ad inisecordiam ? How often hasher weakness proved her strength in the case of just claims brought against her, aad which she was unable to meet? She should not forgeot this when dealing with Mexico. A troublesomie question, and one which may very probably ultimately break off the negotiations, is that of the execution of the treaty for the payment of Spanish claims. Spain has, on her side, the plausible, perhaps the- rightful argumdent, that as the treaty *as 'signed so must it be exeented. Shylock demands -his pound of flesh, and will have all that is set do'Wi in the bond. Mexico declares her readinwss to execute the treaty, but adds, through Senor Jafragna, the expresion of her conviction that Spain. cannbt desire to insist upon its matly fraudulent part. Two-thirdi of the claim ar aadmittea as good, and she proffers itnmediate -psyment;, but she a 'for a revision of the other-, tird.; . Spain, perfectly awrae that some of the bonds aro fraudulent, but knowing also that they belong toX Spaniards (some of them wealthy and of high degree), refnuse and probably will peris in refusing, the revidon, which, in common fairness, she ought 'not to deny. It is' by some of thee- claimants that. a portion of the Madrid;pres Is said to be inluenced. .Be that ast may, .tere seenms a strong feeling abroad against making any kdnd of concession to Miixico, and the Spanish' Government (even if it: ba; well disposed toi'an surragement)is'niotstrong, ;nd hesitates 'to oset this feeling sit defiance.

In this case- hostilities may be expected. It is to be feared that the Mexican question presents very serious dlfcultie, a;nd is by nomeans so near to its settlement as some have recently supposed. According to the Bpna, a very pious paper, upwards of 15 Spanish churches,. including the Cathedral of Segovia, . were robbed during the month ofImarh. In that of April 1T were robbed, including the Cathedral of Burgos, and the valuable sabre of General Urbistondo, a tesimonial for services, stolen from his corpse while the funeral service was being performed over him in the church of San,Martin, at Madrid. The Esyana has not yet ascertained the number of churches despoiledin the month of May. As some set-off to this startling amount of sacrilege, which testifies at once to the religious feelings of the population and to the excellenoe of the police tn this most Catholic county, it is satisfactory to read in the Begeneracion that yesterday some further ceremonies took place in the Chapel Royal on aecoumt of the celebrated nail-one of those with which the Saviour was attached to the Cros This invaluable plece of iron "fwas carried in procession, placed upon the high altar, and, mas having been said, was adored by the Queen and King, the Princess of the Asturia the Duke and Duchess de lMontpensier, and their t hree daulghters.n The Three per Cents. were done at 40.5; ditto, Deferred, 25.90.

In this note I simply purpose to offer you my begt thanks for your cordial offer of assistance, and also to afford you a few details of my plan, and the means placed at mydisposal forcaryingit out. "AS you may not have a convenent pocket map at hand for reference, I send you Lady Frnkin's pamphlet wFhich contains one. UJpon it you will see marked out the 'a rea to Be searched.' All the other lands lid dowFn have been searched. "I intend to sall about the end of June, from Aberdeen, and proceed to Barrow Sribt,-ascertain that the provisions stores, and boats left at Port Leopold and Beeching Ild by the recent searching expeditions are in good order, i the event of my having to fall back upon them,-examine the state of the ice in Peel Strait, and, if practicable, pro. ceed down it into the unknown area. " Should I not succeed here I intend to return to Port Leopold, and proceed down Prince Rgent's Inlet to Bellot Strait, and there miake another attempt to pass into and through the field of search to Victoria Land, where I shal winter, and in the ensuing spring, before the thaw eets in, complete the entire exploration and search by means of sledges drawn by men and by dogs. "In endeavouriDg to reach Victori; Land it is my intention to avoid, if possible, any risk of becoming involved in the ice; and, should I not sucoeed in reaching Victoria Land, I wll return to Ballot Strait to pass the winter, as we know by experience that the retreat of the ship from there amounts almoe. to a certainty.. From Victoria Land the homeward voyage is equly certin, but by way of Behring Straits. "The means of complishing lAdy Franklin's object, the completion of the search, and now placed at my disposa, are ample. The vessel is a three-masted screw schooner yacht, with fore-topsail and topgallantsail; the topsail reefs from the deck; she is dcidedly a cliperdiagonally built, 132 feet long over all, 320 tons builder's measurement, with a light draught of water- trunk engines, of 30-horse power; crew numbering 30 individuals, including an Esquimaux interpreter. ' Almost all will be old shipmates of my own in former Arctic voyages; they shaUl be fed and clothed as in the Government expeditions and receive double pay. I, therefore, anticinate no diffioulty in keeping up precisely the same discipline as that which we found to answer so well in the three Arctic expeditions in which I have served. The vessel is now in the hands of Messrs. Hll, Aberdeen, for the purpose of being fortified, by means of doubling, extra hold beams, stringers, &c., to enable her to withstand ice-pressure; and upwards of 100 men are at work upon her. All Arctic men agree in pronouncing her to be the best adapted vessel ever selected for Arctic service. From her sharp midship secton she will rise to ice-Pressure, which would crush in the sides of a wall-sided vesel. Her speod under steam, when deep, is expected to be six knots. "She will carry five weeW fuel for full speed, and two and a half years' provisions-being enough to last us for a second winter, should we unavoidably be detained. Ibelieve I have nothing more to add, except to say that the volunteer offers of service from offioers, seamen, and landsmen, are very numerous; and as I have already secured the very beat of 'mat6riel,' so I hope also to be fortunate with the 'personnel' of the expedition.

We seem to ee in the pictu m3ost marked by Italian character- the effect rather -of Lombard thanof Romnanteacihing, and it isprobile that while in Italy Van Orley did not limit his studies to a single schooL I This Italian teaching 'is the death of genuine Flemish. art, which was, indeed, only preserved from sinring into utter degeneracy between the time of Van Orley and that of Otto Van Veen (the master of Rubens) by the operation of portraiture, in keeping up some healthyrespect for nature. The ideal art of Flanders did not revive till the mighty power of Rubens pased orver its dry bones. -But while Flemish art was langauhing in the arms of its fair Italitn Armida the national element .Was still finding genuine expression in Upper Germany. The schools of Colar anud urembere g, and their offshoot, the school of Saxony, may all be studied in the Manchester Exbibition, the first in the piotre of Martin hoen (1420-1488), the second in those of Wobigemiath, D)irer, Burgkinaier, Schauffelein, Pens, and Grianewald, the tfhird in the works of Lucas Sunder, better known from the name of his birthplace as Lucas of Cranach. Beside& these schools, we have also to direct .attention to the landscapa art of Hainuilnt, which grew up in the 16th century under Patenier and De Bles, of both of whom the Exhibition contains good examples. The school of Colmar, under Martin Schoen, was more prolifiz of engravings than of pictures. Dr. Wasgen goes so far as to say that there are no genuine works of Schoen out of Colmar. Here, at all events, ale two pictures bearing his name-a " ChLrist Shown to the People" (421), which nay usefully be compared with the picture by WoUgemrith on the same subject (405), and a " Virgin and Child" in a gardeni (437), with m3uch of the sweetnews and grace which are the most agreeable characteristics of the master of Colmar. To estimate his power and tenderness fairly the vsitor mut go to the admirable series of engravings in the orchestra gallery. He will find there in some single femgs figures,-xsints or personified virtue--a serene and elevated beauty which it is difficult to paraud in German art out of the school of Cologne, or atr the p od of the Van Bycks and Remuhg. There is little of this in the sEcce Homo" of the painter (421) T-hough the Christ is not waiting in mild dignity and resignation, caricature reigns through the other personages of the composition. This may be intended to enhance the effect of the face and figure of the Redeemer, who certainly shows among his hideous accusers like an emblem of purity contrauted with the foulest conceivable embodiments of the world, the flesh, and the Devil. Among the engravings of Martin Schoen here exhibited is a "Temptation of St. Anthony," which Michael Angelo admired so much that he is said to have made more than one elaborate copy of it with his own hand. Schoen was the master of the elder Holbein, of whonitheExhibition contains no example. Michael WohlgemaXth and Albert Darer, tae leaders of the school of Nuremburg, liLe Schoen, can only be fairly estimated by taldng into account their engravings as well as their paintings. Woblgemiith (1434-1519) was one of the greatest engravers of his time, though doctors differ materially as to the actual nature of his work. Bartach, praising his woodouts, denies that he ever worked in copper. Zani, on the oter hand, loudin admiration of his designs on copper, confidently asserts that he never worked on wood. The truth probabily is that he deged both woodouts and copperplates, though it may be doubted if he ever cut the wood blocks himself. The invention of crow-hatching in woodouts has been attributed to him, but examples of it before his time are referrei to by Mr. Chatto, the leaned author of the text in the Histary of Wood BFngraving which goes under the name of Jackson. As a painter, Wohlgemiith's works here show how completely the fantastic element triumphed in his conception and execution. Take, for instance, his "' Pilate" (417). While it cannot be denied that there are expression in the heads, dramatic intention in the action and grouping, and both force and finish in the execution, there are yet an overpowering ugliness in te features and an utter want of grace botl£ the single figure and in the composition, taken' as a whole. Something of this may be due to the lack of beauty in the Bavarian race, which supplied the paiter with models But more is owing to the weakness of the sense of the beautiful in the painter. We are safe in inferrig this from the case of his pupil, Albert Darer, who, worldng from the same mnodels, has yet often produced works full of dignity and not deficient in beauty. Here, again, toformanalyadequate conception of the master's deserts by what is here shown of him, we must go to the engravings rather thn the ' tures. During Albert Darer's laborious life, Y,etween 14n and 1528, he produoed a vast amount of work in the shape of pictures, drawing4s, carvings in wood and soft stone, engravings on copper, and engravings on wood. Bg ai these means he inluenced the arts both of paint.- ing and industrial design more than any painter of his time, without as well as within the German frontier. His engravings circulated all over Europe. Raphael knew and valued ftem, and exchanged drawings with the Nuremberg painter. One of the drawings of Raphael. so sent is stillnthe collection of the Archduke Charles at Vienna. The niversality, indeed, of Dfirer'sr powers and the variety of his achievements in art are hardly exaggerat even in the high-flown epitaph which describes hin as "artium lumen; sol artificum; pictor, chalco. graphus, sculptor sine exemplo." Albert Durer travelled both to -learn what the artists of other countries were doing and to display his own skill. Of these tours he has left curious records-one of his journey to Venice in 1,%&, the other of his circuit in the Low Countries in 1520_ which remain the best sOurces of information for the artistic life of the 16th oentury, its gain s, its jollitiers, its antagonisms its rogueries inthe persons of rivals, and its mortifications in the case of tha poor painter himself. Of this master there are only th pietures here -a "Madonna and Chid, with Sainte" (440), a "Birth of the Virgin" (44), and a portrait of the Iter's father, theold goldsmith of Nuremberg (462). The first of them Is X e rtain dignity which indline us to onaider it genuine The aeci is theworkof some infedior hnd from awel-known design of Albert Dvires. TM tbkh hi. a q Vai

I nvmornw v r n-o (Before the LORD CHANCELopR and the LORDS JuSTICES of APPEAL) This was an appeal from a decree of the Master of the. tolls setting aside certain deeds, by whioh the plaintiff co- vgyed to thLe defendant a reversionary interest in a, house and land near Scarborougb, and also directing an account to he taken of what was due to the plaintiff. The case, itvhioh wan o-ne of evidence as t-o the knowledge of the plaintiff at the time of the transaction (he being without any professional assistance other than the defendant), and also as to Ithe exact value of the reversionary interest, was not concluded at the rising of the Court.

ROLLS' COURT, COToEsY-LAIM JiTE 3. * PACK?MA v. vrniA. I -- (Before aie MAsTmi of the nOLES.) JIM kiONOUP. gave judgment in this case,which was chiefly heard in his private room, but of which the partioulars, as far as.allowed to be made public, were as follows.- The plaintiff is a medical officer belonging to the East India Company, and over in this country on sick furlough. Daring his residence he has never regularly practised as a medical man, but, being a gentleman of considerable knowledge and proficiency in his professon, attended many of his friends at their request, and, among others, a Mrs. Vivian, the testatrix in the present suit. When Mrs. Vivian died she left Dr. Packman, the plaintiff, a legacy of 300L., to be paid to him at once, and a further sum of 7,0001. contingent on his children or himself surviving her husband; and she further directed her executors, thoeugh not by her will, "to remunerate Dr. Paokman for his attendance upon her in a very handsome manner." The questions now raised before the Court were whether Dr. Packman could claim as a creditor against the testatrix's personal estate in respect to his attendance upon her as a medical man, or whether his attendance upon her was merely that of a friond, in respect of which he could sustain no legal remedy. The Court held that the direction given by the testatnx to her executors was merely an expression of her wish, and not the admission of a claim; and that Dr. Packman had attended upon her solely out of kindness, as a friend, and not as a regular practitioner soas to entitle him to make out an account as against her estate. Mr. IL Palmer, Mr. LoId, Mr. Selwyn, Mr. Shapter, Mr. Piggott, and Mr. Goldsmid appeared in the case.

DICKENSON. - This was a conLviction for the infringement of a by-law made under the 90th section of the Municipal Corporations Amendment Act, the 5th and 6th of William IV., cap. 76; and the question submitted to the Court was whether a certain projection of his shop-front whioh had been erected by the appellant Dickenson was an offence within the by-law. Mr. Overend and Davison were heard In sunport of the conviction; and Mr. IL Hill, QC., and Mr. Lidell, forthe appellant. LTord COArNBm said this was a case in which the con. viction vwas good on its face; but the parties had agreed that the Recorder of lNewcastle should state the facts for the opno f he Court. The question was whether a projection whI the appellant had eretecd over the footway, and the extension of his shop over the footway, was an offence within the by-law. His lordship said he had no doubt that it was Eo, and that it was an offence of a grave nature. H.s lordship added that he regretted to see that such offencEs were also frequently committed in the metropolis, and thbt a public robbery was committed by projections being made into the footways, which prevented the public from using them as they had formerly done. There was a remedy for the offence, for it was indictable, and at N~ewcasUle these was a local Act which gave a sumimary remedy. The other judges were of the sa3me opinion r. JusticeEs added that the Legislature bad taken awaythelwrit ofaerthoea d because it had been appniedin such a manner as to encourage objections in reswect of usoless forms; but if it could be restored so asto enable the paxties to have substantial questions of lawf decided it would be a great advantage. Conviction asfomed. TH QUEEN V. LACASIE. Ir thiS case the defendant had been convictedby the magistrates of selling a glass of sweet wine, to be drunk on the premes, the same being aillege t to be "exciseab]e liquQr," without a license. The conviction being appealed against, the sessions stated a case for the opinion of this wasrt "feciseableileiqutor"S itehdin° thwe meaning of thel18th section of the 9th of George IV., cap. 61, on wtich the conviition was founded. Mr. Scorr.aa'w, in support of the conviction, saaid that untder the 6th of Goorge IV., cap. 11, sweets, or made WineS, were subject to an excise duty. A subsequent statute, the 9th of George IV., cap. 61, enacted thatno license should be granted for the sale of " exciseable liquors" by retail to he drunk on the premises, until the party ha obtained a justice' license ; and the 18th section enacted that every person who did so should forfeit and pay a sum not exceedin 2I, and not less than 5& The 4th and 5th of William V., cap. 77, enacted that all the duties of exise on sweets, or made wines, &c., should be repealed; but the 10th section enacted that licensesj for the sale of sweets, or made wine, should be taken out as before. The learned counsel contended that, although the duty on "sweets, or made wine' was repealed, it was still an " exciseableliquor" within the meaning of the 9th of George!IV., the excise duty being now levied, not upon the maufacture of the goods, butlby a license imposed on the vendor. Mr. HUDDLESTON contended that "sweet wine" could not withany propriety be considered as "exciseable liquor" when the excise duty had been repealed. Such a construc. tion of the Act would render it necessary for every confec. tioner in the kingdom to take out a magistrates' license. Lord CAMPBELL said the question submitted to the Court was whether sweets, or made wines, were exoiseable liquoaa. within the meaning of the 9th of George IV. If they were, the conviction was to' stand- but, if not, it was to be quashed. He (Lord Ca;pbell) was of opinionthat they were not exciseable liquors. Under the excise laws sweets, or made wines, were subject to an excise duty- and an excise license was also to be taken out for vending them. But the duty had been repealed, 'while the license was retained. That, howfever, did not make sweet wine "exciseable liquor." Mr. Justice ConmruGE and Mr. Justice CBOmpTOX were of the same opinion. Mr. Justice 1Rix dissented from the majority of the Court, and thought that sweet wine was "exciseable liquor" within the meanin of the 9th of Geor-e IV., cap. 61, read with the 4thand 5th of William IV., cap. 77. Under the former statute a party became liable to a penalty if he retailed sweet wine to be drk on the premises with. out a Heense; and, though the 4th and 5th of William IV. repealed the duty, it, by the 10th section, enacted that " all such licenses should continue to be taken out in the same manner as if this Act had not been passed." Conviction quashed, but without costs. TE QUEN V. BAEEWEL. In this case the defendant had been convicted by the magistrates at Rugeley, in Staffordshire, of signing a false certificate, stating that one Daniel Craddock was a man of good character, in order to his obtaining a license to sell beer the said defendant well knowing that the said Daniel Cradock was not a man of good character. The conviction was brought into this Court by certiora?* with a view toits being quashed upon the ground that it was bad upon its face. The conviction was made in the form contaned in the schedule to the 11th and 12th of Victoria, cap. 43; but it was provided that that statute should not apply to any information or complaint or other proceedfig under the dAatutes relating to Her Majesty's Customs and Excise, Stamps and Taxes. Mij P5sIS and M, SSCOTANDI in SUppoXt of tb9 c.°*- tlon, contended that the itatate under wMhch the defendant was convicted wAs not a state relating to Her Majesty's Custom or Excise. It did not relate to the revenue, but te regulations which it made as to the mode in which license should be granted were in the nature of regulations of police. Mr.!PAsar4 , JQC., suppored the rule for quahng the conviction. Lord CAMPnBxL said he was of opinion that the conviction was properly framedi according to the form given in the 1th and 12th of Victoria, chap. 43. That statute con. tained an exception that it should not apply to any informs. tion or complaint or other proceeding under the statutes re. lating to the Customs, Excise, Stamps, or Taxes. But this was not a proceeding under such a statute. The word "statute' here meant an " enactment." The word statute sometimes meant an Act of Parliament. Sometimes it meant a code,Cas the statute of Westminster thelst. All the Acts passedjinlone session were also considered as one statute, andthat was the original meaningoftle word. Herethe conviction did not relate to Her Majesty's revenue of Cstoms or Excise. The convictionwas on the 8th seetion of the* 4th and 5th of WilliamIV., chap. 85. There were some sections in that Act which referred to Her Majesty's revenue, and some wvhich had no relation to it whatever. Tn the latter dass was the 8th section, which contained a police regulaton requiringacertificate of good character to be given to the person to be licensed. ft was a police regulation, and not a fiscal regulation. The statute the 11th and 12th- of Victora, chap. 43, had given a useful form, and thated havinglbe owe the conviction muat be con- The other judgea being of the same opinion, the conviction was confirmed.
COURT OF COMMON PLsA-. W%P Tmr Q BELLHOVSE AND ANOTER V. THE CORPORATION OF I~ ~~s .\- (SWings in Banco. 2wnii, Tomr'.I This was an action tried lat Liverpool assizes, before Mr. Justice Crompton, when a verdict was found for the plaintiff, Sirdeg O. KELY having obtained a rule niri for a new trial, on the grounds that the verdict was against the weight of evidence and that the damages were excessive. Mir. Atherton, Q.O., 3r. anisty, and Mr. Wheeler apXared to shoW cause against the rule; and Sir Fitzro is py, QtC.,tfir. IMD, C., Ir. Monk, and Mr. lelish I&r. A xuOI in showing cause against the rule, was stopped, and the Court called on the learned counsel for the defendants to support the rule. The action, it appeared, was brought to recover damages aganst thecorporation of Manchester for having erected a bridge and tunnelupon the riverMedlock, wherebythe water was obstructed i its flowing and thrown back, causing it to ise higher than it otherwise vwould have done. On the 11th of August last year there was a great flood in the river, and these obstructions on it, made by. the defendants, caused the river to oyerflor the plhantills premises, a mill and factory built on its banks, whereby a large quantity of machinery and goods wag damaged and destroyed, their mill was stopped, and they lost much profit. The plaintiffs'evidence was that the obstricotions caused the river to rise 26i inches, which was 22 inches above the embankment wall of their premises; and, according to the plaintiffs' evidence, if the tunnel had never been. made the water would have been 42 inches below this embankment wall top and the damagecould nothave occurred. According to the defendants' witnesses the corporatioa works only raised the water 15 inches; consequently, as the water went 22 inches over the plaintiffs' wall, if these works bad never been made the water would still have gone 7 inches over the plaintiffs wall, and would have inf9icted nearly as much damage as the plaintiffs complained of. It was also stated that for several hours before the water had surmounted the wall it had got into the mills through the soughs and damaged the carding engines. The (,xE' JusTic, In giving judgment, said he was of opinion that the rule must be discharged. The queston was one entirely of fact, and therefore a proper one for the determinafton of a jury. It was trme that it involved a somewhat complicated question, depending very much on scientific views, and therefore it might have been as well or better disposed of before a different tribunal. This had been suggested at the trial, but the learned counsel on both sides had declined that 3mode of settling the matter, and had desired that it should be left to a jury. After a very careful consideration of the arguments presented to the Court in detail, he was not at all sure, if the Court were called upon to decide this question as a jury, th they ehould not come to the same conclusion as the jury ba done. The whole argument rested on the assumption that the plaintiffl witnesses, in ascribing the rise of the water to amount to 26 inches in consequence of the defendants' works, had not given credit for 15 inches of rise said to be due to the Oxford-bridge over the river; but the sensible effects of the obstruction of the bridge were only felt at the tunnel, and consequentl but for the tunnel, no mischief would have arisen fromthe rise of 15 inches. But be this as it might. this was a ques-I tion for the jury to decide. It was true that the jury had not had the advantage of the addresses of the learned counsel, which had been waived at their request; but, on the other hand, the jury had all the vidence before them. If, as the Court was now told, upon the figures as admitted or proved beyond dispute (as to the number of inches the water had risen) certain conclusions could have been arrived at, or only could co arrived at, it was for the learned counsel for the defendants to have insisted on his right to address the jury, and he could not but believe that a special jury of the county of L&ucaster would have given every attention to such an address, and, if necessary, have changed their views upon it. The learned judge who tried the cause waa not dstisfied with the conclusion at which the jury had arrved, and he therefore thought that the Court ought not to put the plaintiffs to the expense of going down to have this action tried again. The other learned Judges concurred. Rule dischagd This case occupied the day.
I . COURT OF EXCEEOUEP. WvnvvEEAv- .Tm Q SPECTL PAxPR ROIBgRT v. Am.'rn?s (SWings in Banco.) This was a speoial cas framed in- -an action to recover 48gl5. as tho amount of fees received by the defendant for the use of the plaintiff. It appears that the plaintiff waz the clerk and sexton of the mother church of Aston juxta, Birminghain and that the defendant fillecl the same offies ' the trict chapelry of St. James, Ashted, which was originaUyK part of the same parish. By the agreement entered into by the parish on the consecrtion of the chapel in 1810 it 'was providea that the curate and clerk thereof should receive the like fees for burials, ire., performed in the ohapl as the 'vicar and clerk of the maother church did and exclusive thereof, and that the cmrate and clerk of the chapelry should account for the same to the latter quarterly. It futher appeared, as we understood, that the defendant had, durlng th period over which the plaintiff's clam extended, only demanded and received the fees payable to himself. 'Under these facts, taken in conjunction 'with the operation and construction of the Church Building Acts, the point in disute was whether the plaintiff was entitled to recover the fees in question. Mr. PmEwsoN (with whom was Mi. Cripps) argued for the plaintiff. The Solicitor-General (with whom 'was Mr. Lush) appeared for the defendant. The CoURT took time for consideration. (BiUigs, at Nisi -P2u, before Mr. Baron Canzwx= and Comm"n Juries.) The Court was occupied the whole day In trying a oompli. cated action for an excessive Wae of goods, the detais of which were of no interest except to theD parties.

Mr. Sleigh appeared'for thedefendant, Mr. Nash on the part of the prosoction. Edward Ljew4 ntson, said,-I an the secretary of the "Tradesman's and Mechanic's Loan-office," at 16, Fetter. lane. In September, 1856, the defendant called at our office and said Mrs. Babg was desirous of obtaining another loan u;on tho same securitvy but, as a former loan had not benaU repaid, it was objected to. It was then proposed that a warrant of attorney should be given, and that Mrs. Bass should repeat her declaration that she was a widow. The defendant said it was perfectly unneoessary, as he could solemnliy de e she was still a widow. and the mmn of 301. upon the execution of the warrant of attorney was accordingly advanced. Aldermau HAir vkea if this Loan Society consisted of only one person, or many ? Witnes,-Only one person. Mlria Foster, who is my sister, and I acted as secretary and manager, but I wasnot a partner. - Mr. fartin (the chief clerk) inquiredthe actual amount of money advanced to the defendant? - , , - YWitness said, the amount of the loan was 30., and, the amount advanoed, after deducting. interest and 24.which. Mrs. Bass owed. was z224. l0., to be repaid at 41. per montli. Only 181. of the last loan has been repaid. He did not know Mrs. Bass,was not a widow until lateylywhenshe made afdavit in March lst as a married woman to release th, defendant, who had been arrested upon this matter. He did not sue the defendaut, but entered.up liudgment upon the warrant of attorney for the whole of the loan, althoughonly 12. was due. Thedefendantwas taken before a judge at chambers anddiwharge',sndheafterwvardabroughtauaction aga Maria Foster, and obtained a verdict for 501. damages and costa; but there was a rule nisi before the court to argue several pointswhich had been resrved, He. (wituess) had charged Mrs. Bass at Bowlstreet police-office LWith perjur upon the declaration now put in about a fortnight a"o and she wa disharged. He remembered Mxs. BaEs caf1i'ng at the loan-offioe with Mr. King, her solicitor, and Mr. Gaden mathe summer of 1856, but 4qo conversation ensued relative to Mrs. Basa being a married womau and her husband being sl alive, and a solicitor and town-clerk of Dover. Nlothi was said about his ostio'e lna g hg omaehr botter allowance. pledged'a oath that no such conversation tookpIace at that or any other time or place. Mrs. Baes had asd about five or sx previous loan, all of which had been repaid; but if he hadknown she had been a married wroman he would not have lent the money. He would not have advanced the money at all if the warrant of attorney had not been executed. His sister had keDt this loan-office about six yqars. Mrs. Bass was then clled and said she lived at lo. 13, Hanovercottages, Regent's-park. She was a married woman, and her husband was still alive for any, thing she knew to the contrary. She had not seen hiim for many years. She had known the defendant for very many years, and he was with her when the warrant of attorney was drawn up. She signed the declaration in which she was describedas awidow, but the only par that her attention was drawn-to was that reterring to thefurniture being her own. It wasin August last that she went with Mr. Gaden to the loan-office and saw Mr. Lewis, and' told him she was a married woman, and tbat her husbind I was a solicitor and held the office of town-clerk of Dover. She also remarked to lr. Lewis that it was a hard case that her husband, who was. so exceedingly wealthy, should not make her a better allowance. She had known Maria Foster a great many years, and th'ought every one who knew her knew she was a married Woman. Mr. Benjamin Gaden- said, he was present at the loan- offioe in AuguAst last, and heard Mrs. Bas say she was a; married woman, and that from her husband's position, .as. town-clerk of Dover, how differently she ought to be situated with regard to pecuniaiy Matters. Mr. Sleigh denounced these proceedings as a monstrous attempt at persecutionfor the purpose of inducing the dews fendant, if neld to belU upon this charge, to abandon hiMs verdict for 501. damres and costs. Alderman H&LE said, he had heard the case, and was satisfied from the evidence, althotgh Alrs. Bass had sworn she was a widow, that the comalaiant knew perfectlywell she was a married woman at thfe time the money was ad-- anced, and the case was therefore dismissed 'Mr. Sleigh then applied to 'the Alderman to commit Lewis for peury, butthat being a very unusual coure in such charges, be then applied for a Qsmmons against him to answer a charge of perjury,which was granted, but is not MA1L0oA0UGHoR-StM.-Joseoh Thompson, landiord of the One Tan publichouse, Arandel-court, Ilaymarket, was summoned be fore Mr. BsA:noNT for detaining a, watch, valUe 64, under the following circumstances ._ Charles Silverthorne, 23; U per Ogle-streetk stated that he went into the defendEat's house about 2 o'clock in the morning of;the 21st of May, and while at the bar he was robbed of his watch. fle told the landlord of his loss, and added that he would give 4L to recover the watch. The landlord spoke to a rson stunding in the bar, and theo said to him, " It wN be all right, the- must turn it up,; or they shal not come in here again.," He told the landlord he would call the next days He did call, and the-landlord& said, 'IIfs all ight,but they won'tgive itup uder 410s.O; they say tLe Moll had got it." On Sunday he called and the landlord sxida to him, " You Went to the staionhouse about it. It yon will leave the four quid with my daughter, she will give upthe watch." On Monday he called aRan, and askld the lindlord if he was positive; the watch was the one he had been robbed ^f. The landlor4T said yes, and described it, saying there was a crack on the dial, and giving the namne of the maker. He did not gi any laoney to the defendant, but consulted an attornery.' Mr. Wontner said, this wa the mse. H e relied on-the evidence of his client as the proof of possesson on the parb of the defendant. Mr. BxEAoD said, theproof of posse=9lon was not sufficieut to enable him to act 'on the clause of the statute tniir which the defendant had been sunnmoned.

WORSIP-STRnMrr.--John Edwards, a man well-dresoed in black, with a broad seam under one of his eyes, aud Richard -haw, dressed in tweed clothing, and having the appearance of a farmer, but described as having been in the service of the General Omnibus Company, were charged before Mr. D'EYNcoutT on suspicion of having been concerned in the following adroit robberies - Mr. James Lonergan, a merchant in Austinfrisrs, and residing at Walthamstow, stated,-At a quarter to 2 to-day I was sanding in front of the book}ag-office at the Bishops. gate terminus of the Eastern Counties Railway, to get a ticket to take me to Woodford, when I suddenly heard a gentleman exclain that he had lost his watch. I immediately placed my hand on my own watch in my waistcoat pocket, to malke sure of it, and kept my hand there for some time, but was obliged at last to move it to get my money for my ticket, and, although this scarcely occupied a moment, I found Upon retUrning my hand to my. pocket that my watch, which was a gold pocket chronometer worth 60L, had been stolen. I instantly grasped a hand which was going away from my pocket, and which I found to be that of Edwards, whom I accused of having stolen my watch. le denied it indignantly, saying he was incapable of such an act, but I seized himA by the collar and held him till one of the com Pany's officers came up, and then gave him into custody. Thera were several people,-indeed, Imay say a great crowd, round m,e at the time, which necessarily induced much confunon.~~~~~~~~iuh on James Crannis, the offioer referred to, sai&'-While at the booking-officoe for Woodford, keeping back the. crowd of people, betwoen 500 and 600 in number, I heard the prosecutor excaiara to the prisoner Edwards, " You have got ly watch, Sir," and I seized the prioner. At the same time, seeg something shine on the floor, I picked it up, and found it to be part of a gold chain, and whlie doing that the prosecutor's.watch was handed to me by a gentleman, who had discovered it on the floor, close to where the prisoner and prosecutor were standing. Both prisoners had been at the station all the morning. Mr. Octavius Unwin, residing at Chigwell stated,-Only a few minutes before this robbor I had obtained a ticket for myself, and whle-doingso had my 'watch, which was a valuable silver one, stolen from my pocket. I told the officers of the robbery, and-they asked me to wait a bit, as several men were there who were likely tohave talen it. In aout dthree m inutes hheard the Isa prosecutor acuse Edwards of robbing him, -which Edwards denied, but I indslae upon his being searchled, in hope that my watch would be found upon him, but it was not. Mr. Lonergan's watch was picked up close to Edwards's feet; I think, be. hind him. Benjamin Rule, one of the comypan's watchmen.-I came on duty about half-past 12 o'clock, and saw both prisoners upon the platform. Edwards had a handkerchief in his hand, with which he kept wiping his mouth, and then thurst it three times into Derson's pockets, those of two gentlemen and a lady. That handkerchief is the sane that Edwards now has, and I can swear to it. The crowvd was so great that the prisoners were divided from me, but both prisoners were at times speaking to each other. I did not capture Edwards then, as I had not seen him take anything, but I watched them both tilnearly2o'lock,whenls vboth prisoners near each other at the booding-office, though neither of them pressed forward to the ticket-box. When these robberes were committed I took Shaw, and found in his hand two sovereigns and a shilling. I noticed Shawwas chewing something, and'I therefore seized him by the neck andaget it fromhim;and found it o be something like pieces of a baner's chock, btit was very muCh M Kent, superintendent of the company's police.-At the time of this disturbance I helped to get the paper from the mouth of Shaw, who resisted violently. Ihave since carefully examined the pieces, and find one to be the remnant of a check umon Glyn, Mills, Halifax, and Co., the London bankers, bearmg date the 24th of April, and numbered 1,463. On the bhdy'ibf It there is perceptible " Perr and Turner,;" but I canibt make vsLt tlW.:iaguatue and amount, except the word "five," it aso'ticatoda The other bits of paper in his mouth I b1>4 e to. relate to other robberies I do not know Shaw, butY4*ards's right name is Martin, and I believe that he has b6a already oonvicted at this cODurt.

PRILWAY SHPAEHOLDERR A publio meeting of railway shareholders 'ras held yeste | day at the Loudon TO."ern, for the purpose of taking into consideration a 15't ,norial which was mtendedto be presentad to the Vice'?'resident of the Board of Trade on Friday n't by nuameous large proprietors. J3. E. VANcE having been called to the cbd e- 'plained the object for whioh the meeting had been ,,. v' ed and said that the memorial had already been sig' d by penr sons representing not less than 4,000,0001. of rilvay Pro peltv among whom were ny directors. Tb e memoriaCs ,uQghit to obtain redress of some of the most manifest grievances under which railwa7 proper',,y labomred, and which were specifically detailed a lan a gy le, , aui- ned temperato in the memorial.TIM-w hage cleriginacted the memorial had( been shareholders jr a long period, and were proprietors of upwards of 20 WU. worth of railway property. Gigantic and. diMcult'as the subject was, they would have preferred its heing t,,ken up by the directors of the great lcading compnnIg athemselves, who possessed every facllity for carrying out 'the oVject e but it having beca impossib tonoutrt-e 'audcombilg the power which they possessed, and whiel they. ought to exercise for tlie purpose of pteectifg the it-eresiwsof the shareholders at large, and the i3nstice 'inilinted upon railway property baving at length attained to suchen enormous height, it was felt due liv the promoters of the.pFesent movement not only to themeolves hut to the generalfbody of the shareholders to proceed to action with a view to protect their common interests. The 'apital embarked in the construction of railway nndertakings i the united kingdom amounted to more than 900,000,000M, 'being equal to one'this of the natienal debt. That vast sum had been subsosibed by private lndivideels, and was invested in private entsrprise itbont any aid or assistance whatever 'fro,nthe*Government. On the contrary, they -could not fail to remember the fierce opposition which Government 4 ave to the original promoters of the invention of these iron 3i.des of communication, the battles which they had to idiht with avaricious landlords, and the diffliculties with vhich they had to contend by the resistance of the tenant '£armers, .who fancied that their interest wvere going to bea dlestroyed. It would also be remembered hovv heavily the shareholders wrere muicted in Parliamient, and how great were the difficulties they had to contend with in order to carry out that which had since proved to ba of the greatest advantage to the country. If, therefore, they had any grievances to comlplain of they had thes6tro;sgest right to call upon Parliament and the Government to afford them edress. That they had grievances, and those of a most serious character, could not be denied, and they were fully justified in asking that the system of legislation which had almost annihilated their property-a property which ought to be one of the safest ivestments in this countryshould be altered. In railways the widow'a annuity, the vorphan's patrimony, and the shopkeeper's savings were invested with a confidence that it would receive every fair, reasonable, and just protection from the Government. (Hear, hear.) But, unfortunately, hitherto legislastion i regard to railway undertakings had neither been sound nor satisfactory. From the commencement the legislature had endeavoured to curtail, almost seeming to wish to destroy, their property, as though railways were a nuisance to the country, instead of being the means of promoting its best interests, and of largely cantributing to the national welfare. The profit which had been hitherto derived from the iarge amount of capital invested in railways did not on an average amount to more than about 3!. 12s. 4d. per cent. There w-as a period when railway property realized more than 10 per cent.; but no sooner was the fact demonstrated that railways were equally advantageous to the proprietors and the State than the Government passed a law by which the prospective profits of all railway companies wvre limited to 10 per cent. Instead of railway proprietors being allowed to do. rive the benefit of their investments according to the principle of free trade, the Government by that iufamous measure bound them down to a maximum profit of 10 per cent. per annum. That was the first step i and what was the neext? The next was the encouragement given to competition. The greatest calamity that ever happened to railway proprie. tors was that Sir AL Peel lived at the town of Tamworth. hle wished to speak with every respect of that eminent man; but when he stated that in regard to railways competition was to be the order of the day, he inflicted an injury on | that description of property which no subsequent legislation had been able to remove. And yet the very Tamworth line, in favour of which that axiom was laid down, scarcely paid its working expenses, and as a commercial speculatioa it had entirely failed. Ever since that time competition had not only been encouraged, but had been festered by the Legislature. But he was prepared to contend that competition was not only injurious to the shareholders, butinjurious to the public, and also impolitic as regarded the State. That it was injurious to the shareholders was a traism which needed no proof; but, if the existing lines were free from competition, the companies would be able to afford better accommodation to the public at reduced passenger rates. Where there were two lImes when one wotad be suffcient, it followed that one line impoverished the other; so that neither line was able to give that accommodation to the public which could be given if there were one line only The Brighton Company had said that the would gladly reduce their fares between London and Brighton, but that they were uncertain of the ground on which they stood. Probably soine contractor would rise up and find out some other route on which to form a railway, and thereby destroy half of the moderate profits which the present Brighton Railway Company enjoyed. According to that infamous Bill, caoed Lord Seymour's Bill, if the dividends amounted to 10 per cent. for three consecutive years it was ir the power of the State to take pon of the raUway, guaranteeing 10 per cent. If that law was intended to exist, was it not, he would ask, the interest of the State to hasten the period when possession of the railways should be so taken? The Chancellor of the Exchequer seN uied almost asleep when he hesitated to do all in his power to arrive at that period. If the 300,000,000!. instead of paying 3 per cent. dividend paid 10 percent., the amount for income-tax would be trebled; and if railway property were rightly protected it would in the course of a few years pay 15 per cent., and thus there would be an excess of 5 per cent. to apply to national purposes, supwsing the Government took possession of the railways. The system isrsued in France was altogether different from that adopted in this country. In France certain main lines were laid down by the Government, and all competition was prevented. The line from Paris to the Mediterranean was paying 261 per cent, dividend. The Paris and Lyons line paid 15 per oent., and the Paris and Orleans line 16 per cent; and he had no douhi that at the expiration of the leases these railways would realize to the State not less than 100 er cent. It was found that the exchanges were against this coluntry, and that capital was very dear. Who ought to wonder atit when Australia, America, Canada, Portugal, and even Turkey and otlier countries were holding out verv great advantages to railway proprietors to invest their money in those countries? Who could wonder that the exchanges were against them when millions and millions were expeuded in this way ? In Anstralia they allowed 5 per cent. for the money, with liberty to make as much profit as they could out of the railway. In Canada. so great was the advantage of the Grand Trunk line to the State that it bad given up to the company the 4,000,0001. which it had advanced to them. But here, in England, the Governinent actually hound them down to a maximnum rate for passenRerS and gonds, and in addition to that it permitted competition,which ought to regulate the fare. Competition was good in ordinary cases, because it regulated orices and prevented imposition; but it was not required in regard to railways, because the Government had already fixed the rate of charge. There were many bilLs for competing lines now before Parliament, most of which were promoted by contractors and cnguineers, for whose benefit only they were brought forward. Phe committees professed to protect existing interests, when it was notorious that they passed bills for lines which never could pay the shareholders. The Chester and Holyhead line, for example, had never paid a dividend. If, therefore, these tribunals of the House of Coili,mons were still to be maintained it behoved the committees to hold their hand before they allowed any more of these competing branch lines to be constructed. The chairman next adverted to the passengertax, which, he said, although prefessedly a tax of 5 per cent., vas actually one of 10, 12, and even as high as 16 per cent., because it was levied upon the gross earnings instead of upon the net profits. The question of rating was one of nmuch difficulty. Great injustice was done by the mode in which the poor-rate and other local taxes were levied. The way in which property was ordinarily assessed was accordinir to its letable value. If they wemit to the Bank of England for a poor-rate they would assess the building at what it would let for to an ordinary tenant; but, finding it impossible to ascertain what was the letable value of a mile of railway running through a paiish, reference was made to the amount of profits assumed to have been made on that portion of the line, and according to that amount was the rate levied, although railway property did not cast any burden scarcely on the parish. There were instances in which almost the whole of the ratesof the parish were paid by the railway, although no person connected with the company bad ever been a charge upon it. Omnibuses paid no poorrates; they passed along the streets, having the roads made for them, and akthough they were taxed for passengers, they bore no part of local taxation. 'The whole system of railway legislation, in short, was characterized with fraud and had become a positive di^srace to the coantrv' and if it were petrmiited to continue it Lust ultimately destroy the whole pr,perty of the shareholders. There were only three rail.% ys that were quoted at a premium--the North-Western, 10-; London and Brighton, 112; and the Lancaster and Carlisle, whose 501. sbares were at 751., which was attri- b,t, We to the fact that it had no competition and no useless brsAuclies. The next point to which the chairnan alluded w.s thhe contracts with the P"st-oflice. Without the facilities n" coolimunication afforded by railways it would have ht-e impossible to carry out effectually the penny postal as4tem; yet, notwithst3nding the boon which had been e rferred on the public in that respect, a considerable am 'not of their legitimate parcel traffic was abstracted from them by reason of books and merchandise being conveyed thi ongh the l'obt'office. Shoes, gloves, and other articles veo e sent by post instead of, as heretofore, in parcels by the railways. This was so muonstrous that no eountry but England would tolerate such a thing. But the shareholders ,were apathetic and supine, and their enemies took advantage of their disunion; otherwise they had strength and pos er sufficient to protect theniselves if they would exert it. Why were railways to be niuleted in this way ? 'There were jointstock banks, gas companies, and other great comnmerial companies, hut Government never dreamut of cowing down upon them. The only other pent ho would a dvert to was the jurisdiction delegated by the Hlouse of Commons to the omuittees. No doubtit was a very proper course that a committee should look carefully into private bills, but here a new speces of property had risen up, and tho committees had between 300,0601. and 400,000.000/. to deal with. Considering that this was new property of colossal manitude, and considering the vast ahd permanent interests involved, he was of opinion that the jurisdiction assigned to the Parliamentary committee was neither satisfactory to the public nor to the proprietors, The committees proceeded upon no fixed principle whateTer. There were no data ordic!um bywhichthosecommittees could be bound. One committee would sanction competition whilst Another would protect vested interests ; and accordingly the velne of shares miglht be raised or depressed according to he whir4 or caprico, it mnight be, of the particula individuals consttr,'jug the comnmittee. There ought to bo a tribunal 1savizg fixed principles to rtSulate these OO"Mneting S,';eUes,y and to exercise a sort of generci supervision Ovir all questions conneoted with ralway property. LOrd ialmorBton had the reputation of being able to (rapp with all these difficult cuestions.

(Cheei&) The Chairman concluded by moving the follovwg toiution - " ThttbiraeoetU cordia5yaPP?Ovate memorial tobbtreaented to the Board of Trade oa Fiday next. nd ir of oplzDloWt'at an im. provedeyrtem d railway dllration % Imperatve5l rutred, with a vicwto reoarthe slievaeee the eioarmlalned cat SiaJor%OONWAN sOcorded'thcesolution.

Mr. G. Srme felt that -the sharel:olders were much' in -debted to their chairman for the discretion, discernment;' and research which 'ce had displayed (hear, hear); but he would venture to suggest that as their case was a strong one they oustht to be careful not to weaken it by attempting to do too much. torr do too xu said, the number of miles per diem over which the mnail was carried by railway was 28,692, and by coaches ard other vehicles 32,721. The railways were paid at tho rat ef 9id. per mile; and the coaches and other vehicles evre paid at the rate of 1oid. per mile, notwith. standing tie great saving of time effected by the railways. This diffMrence of payment he considered to be a great Iniustice. It as a fact that the whole amount received by tshe raiways from the Post-office was less than the sum paid in the shape of duty by the railways to the Government, so thats m point offact, the shareholders carried the m.1ails throughout the kingdom without any remuneration whatever. The resolution was then put and adopted unanimously. Mr. AnDms moved, and Yr. Ml'GAtsaJ, seconded, the following resolution:- " S2haI Prennaent co m bo formed in Lcndon, DabUn, and aU theiePrg1ovicial townsfor thepurpee of upprting the objects Ofthe memorli, and thattne genera body of railway Proprietore be easnestly requested to coutribute in proportion to their holdings towarda the necesary expenses" The C naW-.AX said, before putting the resolution to the meeting he wished to explain that he and his friends had been at the expense and trouble during the last three weeks of getting up the memorial, and which they did at the earnest request of some large proprietors, many of them ladies, who could not take an active part in the matter. It would not be possible for him to devote any large portion of his time to the working out the object of the committee, but if the shareholders would appoint one or two paid secretaries in every large town where there could be formed a working committee of unpaid proprietors, he should be very willing to devote a portion of his time to superintend the operations of the committee. (Cheers.) The resoletion was then agreed to, and a vote of thanks having been passed to the chairman, the meeting separated.
NEW PHILHARMONIC SOCIETY. The third and final concert took place last night, with great success. The series was originally announced to comprise six concerts-three in the Hanover-square Rooms, and three in St. James's-hall; bat as St. James's-hall is at present only completed in the imagination of its projectors, the three last performances are unavoidably postponed until February, 185. This is equivalent to saying that the seventh season of the New Philharmonic Society wil begin two months earlier than usual-in St. James's-hall, if St. James's-hall by February next is a bnd flde monument, and if not, somewhere else. At any rate the present soason, though short, has been brilliant; and the cordial reception awarded to the entertainment of yesterday evening has firmly established Dr. Wylde in his position. The programme was as follows PAsr L Oeztnre (King Stephen, OP. 117) Beethoven. Aria-"Abh,di8pIrti i .. - Beethoven. Setenado for wind instruments.. Mozirt. Aia-- Bens raggio. Ro slut. Synphony in B flat .Besthoven. PARr n. Conoerto In a mtnox-Planotorte .. .. .. Beetboven. Aia-"Ab, non giunmge -Be.i. Overture (Oberol. Weber, Conairdtor, Dr. Wilde. The overture, composed (with other pieces) for Kotzebue's King Step7en of Hungary-which inaugurated, the opening of the Opera-house at Pesth more than. 40 years agothough one of the later works of Beethoven, by no means ranks among his highest inspirations. It is vigorous in style and brilliantly scored for the orchestra; but little more cau fairly be said of it. It was, never. theless, judicious on the part of Dr. Wylde to produce the work, since whatever Beethoven wrote deserves to be heard; and the execution was such asto afford it the best chance of appreciation. The other incidental pieces might have accompanied the overture, and thus have made a still more importwat and interesting feature of the novelty-for novelty it comparatively was, so rarely is any of the music from King SkpLhen heard. The serenade, ia C minor, of Mozart, for eight wind instrurments, is better known than the intelligent annotator of the New Philharmonic programmes seems to think. It has been published in several shapes, and as a duet for the pianoforte, under the title of " notturno," is familiar to racAt students oE Mozart. We must not, therefore, class this composition with the sinfonia concertante, and the I4tany in .E flat, which the society may justly claim the merit of having, in a great measure, rescued from oblivion. The execution last night-by Mbessr. Barret and Chisholbn (oboes), Lazarus and Mayoock (clarinets), Hausser and Anderson (bassoons), C. Harper and Standen (horns) - was on the whole very good, although some of the instraments were not always strictly in tune. The serenade is quite worthy of Mozart-in his best manner, indeed -the dignity of the first piece, the graceful melody of the slow movement, and the charming fancy of the concluding variations (to which Mozart himself more than once recurred, and which strongly influenced Beethoven in the last movement of his quartet Op 18, and in the rondo of a pianoforte concerto-bath in the same key) all displaying the genius and invention of the illustrious musician of Salz nrg to signal advantage; while for masterly contrivance the minuet, in strict canon with its trio, also in canon, the answer "inverted" (to employ a scholastic phrase, no other being conveniently at hand), may challenge comparison with any contrapuntal essay of its cla-s. The applause at the end was enthusiastic. The fourth symphony of Beethoven, the most joyous and exhilarating of the "Nine"-with only the exquisite adagio to break the current of its otherwise unimpeded vivacity-was played with admirable spirit, and left the audience at the termination of the first part of the concert in a state of unaniluous satisfaction. The concert was eminently a Beethoven concert, and it was a pitV that anything should have ouearred to mar the general excellence. A sort of apology was offered in the progra.mmes for the pianoforte concerto, on the plea that it uad not enjoyed the advantage of a rehearsal. This was evident from the performance; but it waq not at all evident why aucharLk.hould havebeenincu-redat alL MAdemoiselle Standach, the pianist, who seems to possess a great deal of energy and considerable brilliancy of execution, although apparently soinewhat wanting in taste, delicacy, and finish, played with even more than the requisite energy, and was loudly and generously applauded throughout; htn the accompaniment went so ill that the solo performer and the orchestra were continually at variance. In many instances the fine music of Beethoven (composed when he was most thoroughly imbued with the spirit of Mozart) was scarcely recognizable, even by those most familiar with every point oE the concerto. It v oald be unjust to Mademoiselle Standach, under such circumstances, to criticise her performance, or, indeed, to do anything more than chronicle the extraordinary and almost inconsiderate indulgence of the audience. The singers were MrTs. Leonard Lewis and Madame Gassier. - Dr. Wylde, o. appearing in the orchestra, was honourod by a warm and flattering reception.
CONIEIT OF MIss DOLBY AND MBR. LINDSAY SLOPER.-This annual entertainment took place yesterday afternoon, in the Hanover-square Rooms, arnd was attended by a crowded and fashonable audienee. As usual, the programme was one of the best and most attractive of its clws-comabining, in addition to the peformances of the conoert-givers a variety of vocal music, bly MresdAnaes Clara Novelo and Weiss, Messr Weiss and Sims Reeves-solos on the violin and double-bass by M. S-ijuton and Signor Bottesini ; glees by the members of the Vocal Union; and Meidelssohn's splendid overtare to Buy Bla8, plAyed to perfection by the band of the Orchestral Union, inder the directior. of Mr. Alfred Mellon. Miss Doiby, who appeared several times, but not by any means too often, was never heard to better advantage. In the music of Meyerheer (Hvgucnots) and Beethoven she was as much at home as in the homelier national ballad-of which she contributed both English and Irish specimenS, obtaining an encore for the first- a prettv setting of the Rev. C. Kingsley's " Three Fishers," by Mr John eullah, sung by Miss Dolby with perfect taste. Mr. Lindsay Sloper played twice, and on both occasions distinguished himselfligMy. The pianoforte concertos of Moscheles are so seldom introduced now that it was curious no less than gratifying to listen to the very capital performance of theone in B flat (with the bolero last movement), by Mr. Sloper on 'he present occasion. Works of this calibre, if not inpirations of genius, like the concertos of Mozart, Beethoven, and Mendelssohn, are nevertheless too sterling to be ne lected dltogether; nor can any one who has studied the history and progress of the pianoforte and pianoforte music be insensible to the great debt of eratitude due to suoh pianists and composers as Mosebeles and urummel; who, emulating the example of Clem6nti and -Dassek hefore thbm,- helped to advance the mechanism oft«e is'gruinent with4uipmercising a questionable influeice nj6 2nusic as an art, whiclh cannot be .aid cf the mWAj lty' their contemporaries and successors.

ADELPHI 2'HEAT.-; ADELPHZITHRAdB.; It IS PO~mesnc I itis me time sinco a piece has been produced so b rrarponding to the idea of an " Adelphi drama" as ftbjre DOVeniWle, brought out last night, in the presenco of the browded audience assembled to do honour to Madame Celeste's benefit. We may add that it is a very good specimen of its class. In the biUls it is termed " original," aAn though, in spite of its allcged originality as a whole, it is possibly composed of several portions of distinct French pieces, the fact of such composition does not in the slightest degree affect its merits as a skilfully contrived and effeotive work. At the beginning George Darville (Hr. Webster), a young sculptor, whose social position is that of an artisan, appears to be deeply enamoured of Marion (Madame Celeste), the only daughter of Mr. Grant (Mr. Garden), a wealthy silversmith.. Indeed, he:has so farfor gotten-the exigencies of rank' that he has sent a portrait 'of Ihis beloved to an: exhibition, thus making a public.avodal of ,his passion. The old gentlemian, however, causes the' image t) beremoved before the exhibition is opened, and calling upon the aspiring genius administers to him an insulting lecture that drives him to despair. A short p,ece, entitled Le Ckefw cPuvre d'un fnconnu, would seen to have suggested this introduotory situation, without touching the main action of the drama. -George Daville, in his unhappy condition, walks in the street bfore the house of Mr. Grant, listening to the music that tells of a grand party within. whenhehearsthe cry of "Stop thief " A pocket-bookfan of bauk-notes is thrown in his way by an unknown hand, and when he has taken it up half its contents are claimedaby a stranger. The police reach the spot, Darville is already secured when Mr. Grant, hearing the bustle, opens the door of his house, and, recognizing the sculptor, declares that he cannot possibly be gulty of robbery. So thoroughly are the police satisfied that they depart, leaving GeorgeDa7rville with 10,0001. in his pocket. A short interval elapses before the commencement of the second act, which exhibits George Darville as a man of wealth and the accepted suitor of Marion, with her father's consent. The death of a rich relation is the supposed cause of his sudden opulence, but the audience are better informed on this head than the dramatis personie, and fully comprehend why Darville appears so careworn on the day that is to unite him to his beloved Marion. The wedding actually takes place, but it is an ominous circumstance that when the bridal procession quits the church it passes the grave of a suicide-one Mr. Leslie, the confidential clerk in a mercantile house, who has told his employers that he has been robbed to the extent of 20,0001., bat failing to convince them of the fact has destroyed himself from sheer inability to endure the weight of dishonour. Even here the audience are better informed than the personages of the drama. Though they never saw poor Leslie, they know that his story must have been true, and they pity his son Edgar (played in spirited style by Mr. Billngton) and hiq daughter Alice (represented as the ideal of meek suffering by Miss Lainlaw) when they visit their father's grave amid the pomp of the wedding party, and the young man renders himself penniless by diEcharging his father's debts. The Nemesis is not quick in striknm the real culprit. Ten years elapse before we arrive at act the third, and then we find Mr. aDd Mrs George Darville living in a state of great opulence, to which the death of our respectable though austere old friend, Mr. Grant, has largely contributed, and blessed, with an interesting little daughter, named Lilly (Miss Cradock), who afterwards proves to be an " enfant terrible " in the most terrible sense of the word. George Darville is in that chronic state of misery that no one can represent like Mr. Webster. EdBgar Leslie, under an assumed name, is his clerk, and Alice is a protMge of the benevolent Marion, who is the only person-eave the audience-acquainted with their real position, and even she-unlike the audience-is totally ignorant of its true cause. As the mother of Edg-ar and Alice is in an ailing condition, and the kindly lady is anxious to afford rehef during a temporary absence of ber husband, without having sufficient ready money in her purse, little LiUy suddenly recoUects that she has often seen her father go to a certain compartment of his bureau and open it with a spring. Marion acts on the hint, touches the spring, and takes out a pocket-book filled with bank-notes, and marked with the name of " leslie." This situation affords scope for some very fine acting by Madame Celeste, who has to depict a rapid transition from pure contentment to absolate misery. She tries not to believe the evidence of her own senses; she investigates every link in the chain of circumstantial proof, in order to dissipate her ovwn horrible suspicions; but the more she examines the case the worse it becomes, and at last she falls to the ground, c;ushed bv the overwhelming conviction of her husband's guilt. When George returns he.findshis wife senseless. Such an effect did this situation prodace on the audience last night, that, although they demonstrated' little feeling of any kind at' the conclusion' of either of the first two acts, they now called for Mr. Webster and Madame' Celeste, and greeted the latter with a shower of bouquetsone of the compliments proper to'a benefit. Time, which took so long a stride to pass from the se^ond to the third act, takes a short step of two montbs to reach' act the fourth. All bappiness is, of course, banished from the house of DarviUe. Marion, without revealing her fatal knowledge to her husband, pines away through mental agony, and makes it her duty to support Edgar arid Alics. _ bank-note which is paid to George, who recognizes it as having been once in his possession, and, moreover, traces it to Edgar, awakens in bis mind a double suspicion. Either his clerk has' robbed him, or is in gome secreb communication with bis wife. HIowever, the pangs of jealousy are but transient. An ill-looking fellow called " Union Jack" (Ur. Paul Bedford), who has devoted himself to the service of the Leslies, and hears that an imputation is cast on Edgar's character, seeks an interview with Darville. Jack is the ruffian who stole the pocketbook in the first act, and who, having endeavoured to atone for his crime by assisting the family of his victim, recovnizes his partner in the profits. The raffianly good-heartedness on the one side and the horror on the other are exellently depicted by Mr. Paul Bedford and Mr. Webster. George, when left alone, examines his bureau, the notes are gone, he perceives that his wife is acquainted with his secret, and ho rushes from his house in the frenzy of despair. During the pregress of these events the solemn march of the action has been relieved by the fortunes of Jonas Totty (Mr. Wright), an old friend of George's, and his sweethearb, Patty (Miss Wyndham). When George marries Marion Jonas marries Patty, and when little LiUy is most ably represented by Miss Cradock, as an intelligent child of nine years Mr. and Mrs. Totty are blessed with innurneraLle "olive-branches," who create great amusement. These chUldren are spoiled by their father and scolded by their mother, and with admirable truthfulness are both these functions performed by Mr. Wright and Miss Windham. In the fifth aot poor Marion is d3ing at the house of this woithy couple. George, who has been missing for some days, re-appears in a wild, abandoned, unshaven condition, that is represented with terrific accuracy by Mr. Webster. Ie has brought vwth him a brace of pistols, that he may terminate his miseries by suicide, but his wife, who has watched his movements unobserved, glides upon him like a ghost. dissuades him from his purpose, and dies in his arms. His love for her has been the cause of the original wrong, and her loss must be the atonement. The wild sobbing shriek with which George falls on the neck of his little girl terminates a scene acted with unsurpassable force, and brings the sad tale to a conclusion. Here is a drama so constructed that the interest is maintained to the last, acted with singular ability in every part, and incnlcating the wholesome moral that crime, under any temptation, is not to be committed with impunity. Here we have no tampering with doubtful ethics,-no lenity is shown to vice, but George Darville having done wrong is forced to go through a course of misery' that will satisfy the most rigid judge. The only question is whether the modern public has not grown too soft-heartedto relish an exhibition of such unmitigated woe. This question satis,'actorily solved, there is nothing to prevent the thorough success of Ueorge Darvt'ilCe,
ASSAIULT Dr A RAiLivA-v CAriRIAoE.-Mr. James Algex non Stuart Austen, a middle-aged man, of Headley, Surrey, stated to be a merchant in the city, son ot a baronet, and brother to a county magistrate, was examined before a bench of justices at :Reigate on Tuesday, on a charge of comnitting a gross and indecent assaultupon Miss Emily Burley, lady's maid to the wife of the Rev. Lord Charles Hervey, in a railway carriage during its passage through a tunnel, in the month of May last. The complainant stated that. she left London by the 4 40 p.m. South-Eastern train in a second-class carriage on the 12th ult. There were two men in the carriage with her,. The defendant was, one of them. (Complainant pointed him. out in the court Duriig .the. journey sbe vas grossly' insultedbythe'defen4ant. At first' he spo e pleasantly'to her, but she only spoke to hii *hea he spoke to her. The 'other person in the carriage was a very disagreeable-looking man, with a swooUen hand and. face; he looked as if he had been fighting. She was frightened at him, and objected to get into that carriage. but as the train was just starting she had no titne to get into another. Defendant be an by putting his feet on hers sliortly after the train st= She then moved back on her seat, but she could not move back so far as she wished because she had some parcels on her right hand. The defendant was eitting opposite. The defendant was first sittingin the corner when he put his feet near to hers. Before coming to Merstham tunnel he put his feet on each side of her feet and tried to raise her clothes. When the train entered the tunnel he took hold of both her hauds and tried to pull her towards him. She got one hand released. and then pushed him awav. She resibted strongly, she did not shout because she thought no one would hear, and she thought she would be safer if she was quiet. She was afraid to attract the notice of people in the same carriage. When he found she resisted he desisted. The struggle lasted a few minutes. When the train got to the first sta. tion after leaving the tunnel she tried to attract attention by signss, as she was afaid to speak. She had no opportunity of calling anyone's attention. At the next station she got to she told the porter she must change carriages as she had been insulted. Hile then put her into another carriage. She wrasgoing to Box-hill. Sbe was positive it was the defendant who insulted her. The comi lain-at was cross-examined by Mr. Morrison, who appeared for the defendant, but notbing was elicited to shake her testimony. She said that she did not take any steps against the defend ant until last Friday, because it was not convenient. Mr. Morrison addressed the Bench for his client, and sug. gested that the complainant might be mistaken in the idena tity.of the defendant. The Chairman said the Bench were *.f opinion that there was no doubt in telimatter, and ihey ad therefore unanimously decided upon sesitencing the defendant to three weeks'imprisonment Mr. MorrisTn mndeavoured to induce the bench to change their, decision; and said the defendant would pay 50o. to any charity if they. would mitigate the sentence, but this was refused, and the aefendant was removed to Wandsworth prison. The Bench suggested that the company should havb lights in the second-class carriages the same as in the firvt-clsss, when Athe train was passing throth tunnels. Mr. Reces; the solicitor to the South-Eastern Railway Company, said he would Gonvey ths suggestion ko the boara.
