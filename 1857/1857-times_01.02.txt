MO.YBY-MABKL?T and CIT YINTBI#LIGENC. Thursday Evening. The English ftunds opened to-day at the price to I hich they advanced after regular hours last even- - in consequence of the favourable revenue state. h.ts. The receipt, however, of the full accounts < the Chinese dispute caused the market to be less m at the close, as they seem to denote that little , pectation is entertained of the relations between tl at country and foreigners being speedily restored. C rsols were first quoted 941 to 3, and at the ter- n.mnation of business there were sellers at 941. For1 the new account on the 5th of February the last price vas 94fa to J. Bank Stock left off at 216 to 218; Reduced, 94L to I ; New Three per Cents., S44 to A Exche(iquer-bonds, 080 to ; and India P3onds and Exchequer-bills, 2s. discount to 2s. preinium. Foreigni securities have been steady, with a moderate amount of business. Turkish Six per Cents. fa4 the account were negotiated at 951, 96, and 954; in the Four per Cents. Guaranteed for the account the Il argains were at 1033 and *. The general opexations comprised-Brazilian, 101; Granada New '5ctive, 21*s; Guatemala, 55 and 57; BIexican, for account, 21j ; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., for account, 78 and 78g; Portuguese Three per Cei ts., 43-1j. and 44? ; Rusmian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 95w ; Spanish Certificates of Coupon not Fu.ded, 6; and Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., (34* and 9. This being New Year's-day, there has beeni no busmiess transacted on any of the continental Bourses. The John Bunyan, from Sydney, has brougiht 27,000 ounces of gold, valued at 108,0001. A further sum of 6,0001. in Australian gold was taken to the Bank to-day, making the total which bas reached that establishment out of the 532,0001. brought by the Red Jacket about 136,0001. Ainexed are the stock and share fluctuations dui ing the past year. Throughout the whole period the extreme range of Consols was 10l per cent., that *f the preceding year having been 73 per cent., while in 1854 it was 10g. The clifference between the opeining and closing prices shows an improvernent to have beeni established of 6 per cent. In railway shares the average range of fluctuation has been at least 20 per cent., while the final result has I eln an improvement of fully 15 per cent. As ltcauds the Bank bullion, its anount at the c,nlmmencement was 10,536,9091.; it reached 3J',(S73,75t. in June, declined to 9,530,1521. in November, and is now 10,513,8231. At the Bank of France the total at the beginning was 8,600,0001. In November it wvas as low as 6,500,0001., but it lias since recovered to 8,000,0001. On the Paris Bourse the advance established has been hittle more than 2 per cent., or about one-third of that which has taken place in the English fi l ds. The corn-market has experienced a great clhantge. The price of white wheat on the 1st of .IalnuagR was 84s., and it has declined to 67s. Cotton, on the other hand, has steadily advanced frcm fid. to 7Id. per lb. W ith respect to the declare d value of our exportations the Board of Trade taUles thus far, which comprise only 11 months of ihe year, show a total of 105,845,6311. against 86,847,2801. in the corresponding period of 1855. The movements of the Bank rate of discoumt, which comprised eight alterations in 1855, have been the same in number on this occasion. In January the charge was 6 and 7 percent.; in June it was Qq in 1 ovember it was again 7, and it is now 6. FLUCTLTATIoNS IN THE STOCK AND SHARE MARtKETS DURLNG THE YEAR 1856. A meeting wN-as held yesterday of the creditors of M-essrs. Robert Johnson and Co., warehousemen, who failed on the 19th of December. The debts were shown to amiount to 78,3851., while the assets are placed at 43,2731. Seven days were allowed to Mr. Johnson to ascertaiin if he could offer any satisfactory composition. The commercial accounts by the overland mail to-day describe no material alteration. At Bombay the transactions in imported goods had been considerable at firm prices, but at Oalcutta there was rather less animation. At Canton the demand was inereasing until the rupture with the authorities put a stop to aU trade. From Shai,g,hai Messrs. Gilman and Co. give the foUowing report " Therc has been a further active demand for imports ger erally during the past anonth, and a considerable imprvenment in the prices of staple manufactures, which evihces a very healtlhy state of the market, and, but for the d fnculty of finding a sufficiency of circulating coin in the shable of the Shanghai dollar to meet the exigencies of the t:ade, we should lave had larger deliveries, and possibly ev, n additional improvement; but within the last week tbh hankers and 'shroffs' have had inusual difficulty in ca.hing their notes, and a partial stoppage of business has betn the result, fron sheer exhaustion of the propermedium by which to carry oni the current trade of the place. Nearly all the Carolus dollars have been drained from the port to carny on the enorm,ous silk business of the last four mLonths, and until the equilibrium can be again somewhat restored vwe can only look for a very unusual and difficult moneymaaket. Notwithstanding these disadvantages, however, xuarufactured goods continue to mnove off in fair average qualtities. * Tea has gained a little more attention during the past n,onth, and in the old seasons' kinds there has been an advanlce of lt. to I jt. on black-leaf teas. The new Kysows have been also more looked after, as it seems evident our supply of all kinds is to be very deficient. "Witli regard to silk, a continued excitement has been kept up by the still improving home accounts, until at leng-h prices paid by foreigners hbeve raised the expectations of the silkmen to such a pitch that they have withdrawn nearly all their stocks at present unsold, and wait further accounts from England, under an impression that an acditional large advance may then be obtained. The rap'd rise of 230 on some up to tfaO on other kinds during the month naturally has produced a strong effect on the rapidly clearing inland markets. The business since our last, co uprised in the first three weeks of the month, is shown .o have been nearly 10,000 bales, making the total for the season about 5D3,000 bales, but even the high prices now established fail to attract any large tiupplies. '- Exchange has been steady, but of late a new element of complication has appeared in an endeavour on the part of the hankers who cannot cash their circulating notes with the Shanghai dollar to force sveee upon the holders as an equivalent of paymiient. The latter being at continuaUy varyinig value, it is difficult to see how this arrangement can he fairly carried out, yet at present it is out of the question to suppose that hard coin of the proper description can be found to representthe notes required forthe current business of the place. The difficulty will probably be compromised cre long, and the cessation to the large silk business, which has (irained the p lae of dollars, will ease the currency tightness considerably." Advices have been received to-day by the overland mail fronm Port Phillip to the 24th of October, and front Sydney to the 3d. The latest intelligence appears to have been conveyed by the Lima, which had arrived at Ceylon. The produce of the goldfields continiued large, and a considerable quantity had been shipped by the Montworency, which was to leave for England on the 16th. At Sydney the Coverinient had been authorized to raise the sum of 200,0001. for prosecuting railway works, and also 73,70CN. for liquidating land and immigratioil debenturec shortly faUing due. The followinz further communications have been received regarding the recent decision of the Court of Error destroying the security of dock warrants. It is satisfactory at the same time to announce that a. public meeting is about to be called to devise the best means of remedying the evil. An appeal to the Hfouse of Lords would appear to be the first most desirable step, to be followed in case the judgment of the Court of Error should not then be reversed by the introduction of a bill in Parliament for an alteration of the law:- " Clements-lane Lombard-street. "Sir,-We quite agree with your eorrespondents of yesterdaythat something should be done withoutdelayto remedy the state of thigs created by the recent judgment of the Court of Error inthe cause of 'Kin ford v. Me .' If this deecsion he correct the insecurity of transactions in dock warrants can hardly be overstated, and the mercantile community are daily exposed to risks never before contemplated. But how is the evil to be met? We think one food ectical step towards procuring an alteration of the Law, ii law it be, wnuld be to raise a fund to be devoted to that parpose. If tbis suggestion should be responded to, we beg to say that we shall be happy to put our nanies down for 101., provided half a dozen other firms, by way of commencement, will do the same. "We are, Sir, your obedient servants, " A. B. and CO." 39, Mincing-lane, Dec. 31, 1856. Sir,-All your comments upon the recent judgment of the Court of Error are of strong service to cohimerce. " We doubt the efficeay of any action on the part of the trading community, because we believe the evil to be not in the law, hut in its interpreters. If the judges will dispense nmetaphysics instead *,f justice, and theories in placo of equity; if they will construe the acts of the Legislature by words, ard not by facts, then it is a phantom to attempt to get a spelling-book made for every case which comes before themz. 4 For all purposes of transfer a warrant was defado in comimierce as undistinguishable from a Bank of England note as the latter is froir, sovereigns. The plaintiff in this case risked property of this nature, and should have borne the penalty of his own hazard ; the defendant trusted no one. But here carelessness is protected, and caution punilshed; the law becomes a praise to evildoers, and a terror to those who do well. Majesty vacates the bench; and there is no justice beyond a jury. We buy a bad debt when we purchase goods. "We are, Sir, yours truly, "11. M. HOLBOR-N AND SONS." In consequence of murrain having broken out among the cattle at Mecklenburgh, the Board of Customs have just issued instructions for the examination of every cargo of cattle, sheep, lambs, or pigs from that quarter. Any that may be found diseased are to-be immediately slaughtered, and the remainder are to be detained until it is ascertained that they are free from contagion, the expenses being defrayed by the owners. Subjoined is a plea on behalf of the shareholders of the Royal British Bank .- '"Sir,-The proceedings in the Court of Bankruptcy on the 23d inst. were made to reflect very seriously on the shareholders, and it was sought to brand them as a set of repudiators seeking only to evade their responsibilities. It was said that the shareholders had not met the creditors of the bank ii a becoming manner, or given effect to that spirit of compromise which they had evinced. "N Now, Sir, allow me to observe that up to this moment the list of contributors has not been settled, nor has a call been made by any one who had power to receive it ; and even now, if we were to pay the official assignee, the official manager migit dispute its validity, or vni rersa ; the protracted litigation which has taken place was not onr seeking, and is our misfortune, not our fault. ' Again, how can we be reasonably expected to pay on onr sbares when many of us have been individually sued? I have myself had to satisfy a judgment; a friend has been sued for siearly 3,0001., another for an equal amount; some have had executions put in their houses, some driven from their homies, and othiers constrained to shelter themselves under the protection of the Bankruptcy Court. Is it, therefore, to be wondered at that, under such circumstances, shareholders decline to attend public meetinge, and so advertise themselves to the sharp attorneys who are looking for men likely to answer an action by payment? Let us have protection against such actions, which is not less the interest of the general estate than salvation to the shareholders, and I venture to assert that, though we are unwilling to be torn piecemeal to satisfy individual creditors, . e will (at all events a large section of us) strenuously exert ourselves and make every possible sacrifice to satisfy the creditols of the bank. I cannot conclude without expressing iiiy admiration and gratitude for the forbearance of the great body of creditors, and it should not be forgotten that we, as well as they, are the victims of a scandalous fraud, and that if they are, much to our regret, serious suffe-ers, we are so in a much more intensified degree, that if their loss is teniporary, ours is permanent, and let us all by mutual concession endeavour to mitigate the serious results of this infamous disaster. " Earnestly begging the favour of your inserting this letter, " I remain, Sir, your obedient seavant "Dec. :30. "A SHAREHOLDER." The annexed letter refers to the Chartered Bank of Aistralia, and Mr. Falconer, who was lately their official muanager: " Sir,-Your report of the procecdings at the recent general meetig of the proprietors of the London Chartered Bank of A,'strahia did not notice that par of the chairman'saddress in reference to hlr. Falconer, the manager, in "The friends of that gentleman felt that the report of the proceedings at a former meeting of that Bank, published in Thic T'imes in December last year, might be regarded as reflecting oin Mr. Falconer's character and conduct. TInder these circumstances, permit me to beg you wil do bins the ju,tice to publish the annexed paragraph of the report of the chairman at the late meeting. iI am, Sir, your obedient servant, " AN AUSTRALIAN. "Dec. 30, 1856." " ' The chairman concluded by stating that, in the report of last December a paragraph alluded to Mr. Falconer, and was to the following effect "-i Letters have been already sent out to Mr. Falconer, the inspector, instructing him to hand over the duties of his office to Mr. Brainwell, who has been appointed his successor." Now, that paragrap1 has been considered by some of Mr. Falconer's friends as reflectin upon him; but such was not the Court's intention. e tnerefore felt it to be an act of justice to state that the change had been effected at Mr. Falconer's own request, he ha-ing, indeed, more than 12 months previously, expressed his desire to retire, and during which time he reniained in office at the wish of the Court. Mr. Browne has assured the Court that Mr. Falconer has on all occasions evinced the greatest zeal and interest in the affairs of the bank, and that its present satisfactory position may be ascribed to the course of policy pursued by Mr. Falconer."' The petition and bill for an act of incorporation for the European and Indiani Junction Telegraph Company were lodged yesterday in the Private Bill-office of the House of Commons.

1ArLDWY I2TElGLIGENUE. DV1NDPE AVD APPnAA'rr The half-yerly meeting of this company was held on Thonday, atDundee; Mr. W. Carrin thechair. The report having been taken as read, The CEUAR3As said, the policy the board had been pur. sung and they wished still to pursue was to cultivate, so far as they could, a friendly intercourse with aU the neighbouring railways, to enter into no foolish competition wilch they could possibly avoid, and to cultivato the traffic on the line by every legitimate means, by attending to the wishes both of those who sent goods and those who travelled, always keeping in view the great importanco of the local traffic on the railway. Every shareholder must be aware that Dundee and Arbroath had been constantly increasing for a long series of years. He could recolect when Dundee did not contain one-fourth of its present inhabitant%, and he was sure the manufactires, commerce, and shipping were in a much less ratio. (Hear, hear.) Then, upon their line they had two very thriving I vilages-Broughty Ferry aud Carnoustie-wliich were increasing every year, both in amount of property and in extent of population. Year after year a number of those who carried on business in Dundee were taking up their permanent residence in these villages, and they had an increasing revenue from these sources. The increase of revenue for thelast half-year, as c-ompared with the corresponding period of the preNions year was 1,106. During the half-year ending the 30th of April last, there was an increase as compared with the corresonding period of the previous year, of 1,097l The increase on tbe half-year ending the 31st of October, 1855, as compared with the corresponding period in 1854, was 1,2291., making an increase in the three half-years of 3,4331. Previous to that time they had a year in which the revenue was lower than formerly; but now they had not only made up the difference, but an additional increase of 1,5131. (Cheers.) The directors now recommend that a dividend of 1I per cent. for the half-year, or 33 per cent. per annum, be paid to the original shareholders, leaving a sum of 1,9071. to be carried to next account; and this after providin for the relaying of the line, and for the expenses con=lct lwith the lease to the' Aberdeen and lidiand Companies, and ,with the opposition to their Amalgamation Bill in Parliament. They had contracted for a new pisenger station in Dundee which was very much needeiL Tey had been very much blamed for having been so long in providing better accommodation for the passengers; but they had great difficulty in getting a site, and after they did get a site, it was some time before it was pmrdent to make any erection upon it. He hoped it would soon be completed, and that, when ready it vrould give satisfachon to the passengers and shareholders, as regarded comfort, appearance, stability, and economy. The rolhng stock, and everything on the line, had been kept up in the most efficient style. The agreement under which for some years the traffic in goods between Arbroath and the south was diverted from the railway had expired, and they now expected to get additional traffic to the south from Arbroath. He could not say they had got all things arranged with the North-Easterm as they expected, but he hoped that an arrangement would soon be made. With regard to the future prospects of the company he did not like to say iuch, but if they took the year ending 31st October and compared it with the year ending 31st October, 1855, they would see there ws an increase of 2,1371. Had they not deducted from the revenue the expense of relaying the line, and the expenses that had been incurred in connexion with the proposed lease, they would have been able to pay a di dend of 5 per cent. upon the preference and 44 per cent, upon the original stock leaving a surplus of 4781. Hle concluded by moving the aoption of the report, and the declaration of a dividend at the rate of 31 per cent. per annuni. The resolution was unanimously adopted; and, after a vote of thanks to the chairman, the meeting separated. TRAFFIC RETURNS. Mme.

QUEEN MfARYS SIGNET MRA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In looking over the pages of - our paper, the 16th of December, 1S9:, I met with the enclosed, and beg to drawvyourattention to the fact-that there is a lady residing at Broadstaizs, who is in possession of the identical ring which was worn by hlary during her conftnement in Fotberingay Castle previons to her execution, and given by her to one of her maids of honour as a token of remembrance, who was afterwards so reduced as to compel her to sell it for the value of the gold. The er.graving is on amber, the usual material for sulch puposes at that perod, and, as yen may perceive from the enclosed impression, isjmuch worn by time. It is supposed that the seal in the late Earl of Buchan's collection was copied from it. This valuable antique was purchased many years ago by a member of the present possessor's family at the sale of the celebrated antiquary John MGoewan, of Edinburgh, who considered it a most valuable gem. Perhaps a tyro of heraldry would be glad of an impression from the original ring. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, A UVY6TAjNT READEL -J ?. J-
Io7 AN-D 1857.-To study the cycles of years is to discover many curious coincidences. If 1857 be as like 1T57 as the present year has been like 17Z we shall hAre a warm summer and good harvest. The broken weather of this year, which marred the gathering of the crops so detrimientally, was an exact repetition of the weather a century before. Instead of Admiral Napier and his failare in the Baltic to dispute about, our grandfathers had Admiral Byng. They raised a great outcry about his neglect of duty in the Mediterranean. He fared worse than our Charley; hb was tried, sentenced to death, and shot. But criminals who compared with the garotting robbers of this day, hardly deserved punishment, fared worse. A gallows was kept standing at Warwick, and the assizes were continued from week to week to hang the weavers of Coventry, Naneaton. and the hardware men of Birmingham for rioting about dear bread. In Smith's Comn Tracs, published the year following, the harvest of 17556 is described in words which hardly vary from Mr. Hall Maxwel's recently issued report of 1856. In Edinburgh (17.56) the magistrates met the public discontent aboutbakers and prices, then alleged, as now, to be disproportioned to the price of wheas by the following regulations:-Large bread, to py in money, for a loaf weighing 61b.-Lx finest flour * 9d. 2second flor ; 7d. third flour. Weighing 41b.-8d. finest. ; 63d. seconad, 5d thdrL W eighing 31b.-Gd. finest; 44d. second; 3&d. third. Small brea, to weigh as follows :-Ub. 8oz., finest; llb. 14oz. 15dr., second; 21b. 9oz. 2dr., third. The twopenny loaf, to weigh llb., finest; llb. 4oz. 10dr., second; alb. loz. 7dr. third. The pennyloaf to weigh 8oz., finest; lOoz. odr., second; 13oz. Itdr. third. The halfpenny loaf to wei h 4oa. finest; 5oz. 29dr., second; Uoz. 1.3dr., third. N.B. The bakers are to affix the initial letters of their names on the top of each of their loaves, with letters describing the quality of the flour-viz., F. for finest, W. for wbheaten or second sort, and H. for household or third sort, and figures denoting the weight of the 6. 4, and 3 pound loaves. The price of wheat was then-at rate per quarter-from 46s. to .5s. In Febrnary, March, and April, 1757, it rose to 67s. The masters of post-offlces throughout the kingdom were called on by the Secrctary of State to coHlect information and transsmit it to London for the information of His Majesty as to the probable amount of corn in their respective towns and ditricts. These agricultural statistics were even then hedd to be of value.-Catodonian Mc,cru-ty.

STATE OP MRADE. naANCETER, EJA. L Messrs. Robert Freeland *nd Brother, in their mionthly circular of this day, report- " At the date of our last circular a revival in the dem,nd for goods and yarns had just begun to show itself, aftcr a month's dalness and inactivity. Thisimprovement bec%me 2nore decided as the month advanced, and now quotations range about Gd. per piwe higher for shirtings, and fully Ad. per lb. for yarns. IAt the moment there is only a liritied business doing at these rates. but sellers are very firm, and look for stWll higher prices. " Daring the past year the tendency of prices has been upwards almost without interruption, and we have now arrived at a high point, which wil necessarily induce much caution on the part of buyers. At the same time it has to be observed that the range of prices, although high, has not been forced up by extravagant speculation, for throughout the year the tr.ade of this district has been remar-a.bly healthy; hut it has boee based upon the graduaDI. advLacin ratos for cotton, and there id now less margin for the manufacturer than w,hen prices were lower. The followiny quo. tations show the position of the producer now as comparedi with this time last year: 31st Dec. 18R55. 31st Dec., 18S5. Orleans cettton . 1id., 5yi., OlsI Glut., 7iid-.

The following shows at a glance the proportion shipped to the various markets of the world:- cotton Cotton Piece (oods. Yar,s. Ea.Rt Indies ,, P ack9p. Lb.

The Liverpool cotton-market may be quoted id. per lb. higher in the nmonth for middling Orleans. The stock in Liverpool is reported to-day as 281,430 bales, against 428,810 same time last year; And it is feared the speculators may run up prices still higher. Mule Twist.-No. 20's to GO's are Id. per lb. higber; 70's to 100's, id. to Id. per lb. Water tvwist may be quoted Ad. per lb. higher all round. In piece goods there was a large business done early in the mnonth, without any advance in prices. Again, about the middle of the month considerable contracts were put down at about half the advance now asked. Since then there has been great irregularity in the market, and the buyers hesitate to foUow the upward movement to its fuU extent. 7.8ths and 9-Sths printing cloths are quoted 3d. to 4Id. higher for the double piece; 39-inch India shirtings fully 6d. per piece; domestics T-cloths and longcloths, 1-16d. to Ad. e ayrd; jaconots about 3d. per piece. 'he demand for linen goods from the makers," according to the monthly report of Messrs. Richardson, Tee, and Co., of Manchester, "I has been during the latter part of the month unusuaUy active in anticipation of the spring home trade, and prices of many Scotch Linds are again higher, the bleachers having increased their charges and wages having advanced. Irish goods for sale in the brown are scarce and dear, but of bleached kinds the supply is sufficient, and the pnce is unaltered. Mixture goods (cotton and lineu) of this district wiU be affected materially by the upward movement of cotton, and, being in general demand, higher rates may be looked for. The steady rise in the price of cotton whicli has been gradually established wiU tend to support the extreme rates linen goods have reached, and we look for no material changes for several months to come, stocks being light and spinners and manufacturers fuU of orders for delivery during the spring." [ ~~~~~NOTTINTGHAM, JAK. 1. The Christmas holydays have interfered with business, but, they being now over and the new year commenced, we may look with greater confidence to a revival of the lace trade. Orders for the United States have been in the course of completion, hut for the home market very little is doing. For fancy articles there is very little demand. In hosiery, considering the time of the year, there is fully an average amount of business doing, hut more particularly for the Amenican market. Mlaterial is still extremely dear. BRADFORD, JAN. L The opening market to-day for 1857 has been of a sitisfactory character, although no great amount of business has been done, parties being much engaged in settling accounts for the past year. Prices of wools, yarns, and pieces are all firm, and are likely to remain so. NoticinZ the staple trade of this district for the past year, the Bradford Obsei--er of this day says:- ' In reviewing the piece trade for 1856 the most striking feature appears to be the fldctuation of prices. The upward movement, which began towards the close of 1855, continued with hardly a check during January, February March, and April, into May, and attained a point which seriously embarrassed aU branches of the trade and was especially felt in all-wool goods. During May, June, and into July prices seemed to preserve the even tenour of their way, but in August, September, and October gradually drooped, owing, in a great measure, to an excess of speculative purchases for the rise during spring, and An excess of speculative statements for the fall, as the clip and the July wool sales afforded an opportunity too tempting to be resisted. In November prices found their lowest point, nnd in fact recovered a portion of the fall, and during December have continued to advance-the year closing with great buoyancy and firmness, with goods at about the rates of last MIarch, although many descriptions of wool are considerably higher. " The demand during 18.56 for actual consumption has been large and steady, while the orders given out to niect it have been speculative and spasmodic to a degree not witnessed in the Bradford trade since 1837. The continental markets show, perhaps, but little increase of demand for Bradford goods; the home trade a consumption increasing slowly but steanily, and the United States a trade developing itself by rapid strides. Few novelties have marked the productions of 1856, and none of established or large success. It has become more and more evidentthat woollen weft must be introduced for winter wear, inasmuch as coloured Coburgs cannot now be called a winter fabric, and some advances have been made in this direction. Jn coloured yarns it is beginning to be recogni7ed that there is but little difliculty beyond dyeing in the hank instead of in tho wool, and the use of Coburg in place of lustre yarn,--changes trilling enough, but which might have enabled Bradford to hit the pubhc taste during the last ten yearn. and have secured A splendid fancy trade instead of being really nowhere. uome attempts are making to introdueo cotton in the weft :s well as warp, to which, under the present liigh price of wool we heartily wish success. In Glasgow Norwich cotton is one of the chief tornainents of the piece; and there is no reason why it should not be so in Bradford goods as well. " Looking back upon the past year as a wrhole, it has been one of a large and nrofitahle business. The present year opens with Prospeecs at least as favourable; and we can ofer our readers no better wish than that 1857 may prove as good a year as 1856 and 1855."

AFFAIRS AT BARODA.-On the 19th of October the Guicowar of Baroda died; he has been succeeded by his only brother, Kimdyrow, now Guicowar. The late chief ascended the throne in 1847. Hewasainan of feeble inteUect. dissipated habits and eminently worthless character. Tho debauclieries of hi.s4atter years are said to have boen unspeakably disgusting. Our connexion with the Guicowar State commenced in 15w, and since then our alliance has been close and continnous. In 1820 a separate treaty was negotiated at Baroda by Mountstewart Elphinstone, Governor of Bombay, who proceeded thither on purpose. Foreign relations were,, as formerly, to remain in the hands of the British Government; the internal administration of tho country was to be with the Gnicowar himself. He was to consult with the Resident in the appointment of his Mlinister, as well as in all cases of emergency or difflcultv. In 1S32 his Ilighness had so far neglected his engagements as to compel us to sequester a part of his dominions, and in 1V39 a new treaty was entered on, containing various minor provisions, which has semained unaltered ever since. The late chief succeeded his father in 1S87, and has contrived since then to get 1,000,000h sterling into debt. Baroda throughout his tine has been proverbially the centre and den of corruption, and his Highness's own embarrassments laid him always open to su.picion, it is to be feired, too frequently to undue bias, to give it the mildest name. In 1DM0 the Guicowar visited Bombay with the- iew of meeting the Governor-General, then for a short time sojourning amnon£ us. The cmse of the banker's widow, and the inquiries in 1851 consequent on the cruelties she had smffered through the misconduct of the Guicowar's Government, brought about the misunderstandings through which Colonel Oatram was dismissed by the Bombay Government from the appointment of Resident. So dissatisfiod were the authorities at home with the proceedings here, that Baroda was in 18S3 transferred to the supervision of tho Government of India, and the Resident, previouAly removed, restored to office. The heir apparent, new the reigning Guicowar, has always borne an excellent chaincter; lie is spoken of as a man of correct plivate conduct, of liberal and enlightened sentiments, sound judgment and good sense, and, shouldbthese attributes mani. feat themselves in his adlministration, 'the annexation which the misconduct of his late brother thratened to bring about may be averteed for some generations to come. So far from there being any intention of adding the Guicowar's dominions to our own, the late Lnstructions from home are understood to have been strongly anti-anuexationist, and those wbo talkof theGovernor-General having ordered the seizzUre of Baroda and the deposition of Appa Saib seem to have confounded a late claimant for the throne of Nagporo with the present Guicowar. The rumour, groundless as it is, may occasion panic and disquietude, and will, it is hoped, hasten some legislative enactment on the subject of hipdoo inheritance, the law and siages, now in force being in the last degree open to abuoc-Bomav Ti7na.

ZONDO2V, FRIDAY, JA2UA RY 2, 1857. W'hat a wealthy nation we are ! Nothing can check the ever youthful elasticity of the Exchequer. No wars, no waste, no folly, no improvidence, not even taxation of the most primitive type, can blighlt the perpetual spring of British finance. Reckon not on our exhaustion, emperors, republics, barbarians, civilized or otherwise, fools, or madmen. WVhen we have sown our milliards broadcast over the face of earth and sea, you wiU find us still embarrassed with riches next year. This is the fact, but the sentiment it inspires we confess is somewhat reactionary. As the milionaire, or the fortunate guest at his glittering board, with aU kinds of dainties soliciting his appetite, and wines at a guinea a-bottle passing before him, casts every now and then a fond reminiscence to the days of beefsteaks and publichouse porter in well-battered pewter, we can for a half-hoiur bestow our luxurious pity upon poor nations. A State without either a balance in its treasury or the power of raising 5,000,0001. a-year by an income-tax, or of borrowing 100,000,0001. in two years, is removed from many temptations. It must think a little before it goes to war with all the earth, before it builds twenty ships-of-the-line, or takes up every quarrel of its irritable neighbours, or its own stiU more pettish servanits. To revert to private lifethe man with a limited income, say his 2001. a-year, cannot go from his breakfast table and plunge into a Chancery suit, or enter into a scheme for monopolizing the railway from Sandhill to Muddleport, or buy a library of editiones principes, or sink a shaft for coal through the London clay, making a canal in anticipation, or lend ten thousand pounds to a more speculative friend, or fill a house with S&vres china, Raffaelle ware, Limoges, and Enamel, without knowing much about them, or surround himself with servants whom he cannot keep ouit of mischief, or go into any of the usual abysses of wealth. His possessions must be few, his enterprises none, and his amusements intellectual and cheap. He must read his newspaper at a club, novels from a circulating library, and be content with the theology he can hear at church for nothing. His pictures of life must be the passing throng, his landscapes nature's own, his tour a daily constitutional, and his treasures a few birthday or wedding presents. That he will escape trouble anyhow or anywhere is not in the law of PnovIDENcE, but he at least escapes those of the artificial, cumbrous, ostentatious, and sickly character. So let poverty have its due; even the poverty of the proud old State, the reduced gentleman of nations. Even Spain and Portugal have their compensations. What if they be insolvent ? You wiU find nowhere such capital fellows, such fond fathers, such loving husbands, such lively companions, as among the men who have failed half-a-dozen times, paying their creditors Is. 3d. or three farthings in the pound. But England cannot be so light-hearted. She can never bar out duns and fling away care; nor can she keep out of scrapes. Whatever mischief it is in the power of money to do, she is always ready to do it, and, stranger still, she always finds the money. In the year just ended we have raised by a taxation very light compared with what the elder portion of us suffered for many years no less than 72,218,988l.,-very nearly four millions more than was raised in the year 1855. The amount raised by the Property-tax alone has been 16,028,4221., which bears out what we have said as to our fatal facility of raising money whenever we want it. Pity, indeed, it is that one object alone has power to rouse us to such gigantic efforts, and that the wealth which might render this island a paradise and its cities such as exist nowhere but in Eastern romance should be applied only to death and destruction! By Customs under a freetrade tariff, by virtue of which whole fleets and the produce of extensive regions are admitted almost duty free, we have raised 23,618,3751., upwards of a million more than in the previous year, though what are called the war taxes under this head are very inconsiderable. The same may be said of the Excise, by which we have raised 18,073,7781.-three-quarters of a million more than in the year before. Passing by the Stamps and Assessed Taxes, on both of which there has been a large increase, a Penny Postage has raised this last year 2,869,1521., being a hundred thousand more than in the previous year. This universal increase, be it observed, is concurrent with a drain of 16,000,0001. in the exacting, rough, and almost penal form of the Income-tax. When Sir R. PzE first laid this burden on our shoulders it was confidently predicted-and some recent experiments in finance give colour to the prediction -that people would save it out of their expenditure, and that the receipts from the Incometax would feebly represent the shortcomings of Customs and Excise. It is true enough on every occasion that the sinker of a new well only robs his neighbours, and compels them to sink deeper; but in this instauce the supply is inexhaustible, and the attack upon our incomes only stimulates our enterprise and expenditure. We have dwelt at more than our usual length on the returns of the year because, taking all things into account, we believe them to be unexampled in the annals of finance-unexampled, we mean, in the immense sum received with so moderate a scale of taxation, and from taxes that have a certain tendency to starve each other. Of the Quarter just ended we can only say that it proves our prosperity all the more clearly, insomuch as the comparison of Quarter with Quarter is under the very same conditions in almost all respects. The taxes for the Quarter ending December 31, 1856, were the same as those for the Quarter ending December 31, 1855, yet the produce of the Customs was 525,0741. more, of the Excise 212,0001. more, and of the Stamps 88,0911. more. The Post-office and the Iiscellaneous Receipts we put out of the calculation, for they are largely affected by mere changes of accoumt. But, on the whole, the net increase in the receipts of the Quarter has been 8,0,92i1. The result on the accounts of the CINCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER is that at the conclusion of a year which found us at war with the most powerful military State in the world, and absolutely reckess of expense, and after a very moderate use of our national credit in the way of loans, the deficiency, or the sum to be raised by Exchequer-biUs in the present quarter, is little over a million, and by the end of the Quarter it is probable we may fnd ourselves actually in the process of paying off, slowly indeed, the National Debt. That this debt wir ever be paid off is indeed questionable, and perhaps the consideration we have offered above may seem to suggest that the national character requires the burden, this "thorn in the " flesh," to keep it at all within reasonable bounds. The question, however, will devolve not upon us, er our children, or our children's children. Doubtless the year A.D. 1900 will stil find the national patrimony mortgaged to not less than the present amount. All that we can do is to show ourselves not quite such spendthrifts as our forefathers, and rather more honest; and this we fondly hope we may still do by paying off at least our own addition to this huge debt.
We are now in possession of the full accounts from China, of which the electric telegraph had before furnished us only the outline. SubstantiaUy the first impression conveyed to us of the causes of the quarrel and the operations that followed it seems to be correct. There are, indeed, matters in dispute, such as whether the lorcha out of which the men were taken was carrying British colours, and whether the Consul was entirely justified in the steps that he took; but there can be no question that the Chinese authorities had violated the existing treaty, wlhich requires them to demand suspected criminals from the nearest Consul, and not seize them themselves, and as little that the requisition of the Consul that the men should be restored to the ship, and that an apology should be made, was refused. The conduct of the Chinese Governor-General was throughout arrogant and insulting, and he actuaUy went the length of refusing to receive any representative of the British Government, on the ground that all foreigners were excluded from Cauton. It must be quite evident that to tolerate such treatment as this would be entirely to forfeit the position acquire,' by the war of 1842, and to announce ourselves to the Chinese-always sufliciently ready to grasp at such admissions-as a nation devoid of honour and self-respect, and ready, in the pursuit of material wealth, to pocket any affront and submit to any indignity. It seems to us that the refusal of the authorities of Canton to give audience to the representatives of England, who were anxious to complain of insults and injuries which they believed to have been sustained by tlhose intrusted to their charge, was in itself the termination of friendly relations, and an advertisement that the treaty, at least so far as Canton was concerned, was virtually at an end. In considering the conduct of the British Admiral under these trying circumstances it is necessary to remember the peculiar position of the European communities at Canton, cut off from the rest of the world, placed on the soil of a vast and half-civilized empire, and having no security for their lives or proDerties except the faithful observance of the treaty under which they had established themselves in a remote land and amid a hostile population. To any one who considers the animnus of the Chinese authorities, and the evident necessity of asserting our position with the least possible delay and in the most decided manner, the conduct of Admiral SEY.iourt will appear to have been as judicious as decided, and as humane as energetic. He did not rush hastily into the quarrel, he gave ample time for hot blood to cool, and only when he found that the Chinese Governor-General not only eluded his remonstrances but absolutely refused to allow him to urge them in person did he appeal to the means placed at his disposal in order to enforce that consideration to the complaints of a friendly Power which any civilized nation would have conceded as a matter of course. We have no reaso to suppose at present that enough has been done to bring the Chinese authorities to reason; but there is no doubt that, as in so many instances before, the Chinese, when they see their position entirely hopeless, will bow their pride to necessity, and make whatever concessions may be required to avert the intolerable evils which their arrogance has brought upon them. There is, indeed, some reason to dread that we may do our work only too effectually, and that while we believe we are only chastising a refractory satrap we are really shaking the very foundations of the Mantchoo dynasty. The rebels are evidently watching their opportunity to pounca upon the Southern provinces, and the collision with England, which the obstinacy of YEH has produced, may offer an occasion too tempting to be resisted. It is not likely that we could exchange this Government for a worse, but, considering the vast portion of the human race enclosed within the limits of China, and the little information we possess as to the real objects and principles of the movement, we may well be excused for wishing that the responsibility of such a revolution should not fall upon us. Without, however, embarrassing ourselves for the moment with this contingency, we should lose no time in carefully considering what the present conjuncture requires at our hands. Nothing is so vain as to conceive that any chastisement inflicted on the city of Canton, however severe, will produce any permanently favourable effect on the Government at Pekin. In the first place, should any account of the transaction reach them, it is sure to be so distorted and perverted as entirely to prevent its having the effect on the Celestial mind which we are anxious to produce, and, even if a tolerably true version should by any means reach the Enm'Enor, the news of the attack on Canton, or even the demolition of a principal city, would be regarded with far different feelings by an Asiatic monarch from those which it would inspire in an European sovereign. In China such a calamity would be regarded principally as it affected the revenue of the prince, -in Europe as it concerned the honour of the nation. By this outbreak of hostilities existing treaties are annulled, and we are left free to shape our future relations with the Chinesc empire as I we please. We have no interest in ruining the I Government or disorganizing the society of that vast country-tasks only too easy had we the slightest wish to engage in them. All we want is liberty and security for our commerce, and a prompt and efficient redress of grievances as they arise. To secure the first the recent proceedings at Canton warn us that we ought to enforce that right of free entrance into the country and into the ports open to us which was stipulated for by the treaty of 1842. We must not again be told that our representatives must be excluded from the presence of the Chinese GovernorGeneral because we have waived the performance of the article which enabled foreigners to penetrate beyond the precincts of our factories. Experienee shows that we cannot submit to these degrading restrictions -without exposing ourselves to fresh insults and injuries, and that if we are to live peaceably and trade prosperously with the Chinese we must teach them to treat us in every matter of social consideration as at least their equals. As to the redress of grievances, we ought to be content with nothing else and nothing, less than the admission of a resident Ambassador at Pekin, lwelling there in all honour and safety, and having acceas at suitable times to the presence of the EMrxzn.on. We have been long enough at the mercy of provincial authorities; it is time that we should be released from these degrading mediators, and brought into contact with the central and paramount auithority. The treaty lately existing between us is destroyed by the recent outbreak of hostilities. We have a new treaty to make, aWrd it is our own fault if we do not make it thoroughly satisfactory. For this purpose we would urge on the consideration of the Government to send out at once to China an Ambassador whore rank and position may lend weight to his representations. We cannot acquiesce as a permanent condition of things in an outbreak every 10 years, only to be put down by such forcible meaus of coercion as we have just been employing at Canton, and therefore we had better make up our minds to settle matters once for all, and not conclude a new peace till we have eliminated from it the conditions of a future war.
Governments never make admissions; at least, they never make them at the time. That seems part of the necessary policy of Governments, part of their code of honour. Whether a matter is true or false is an irrelevafnt consideration which must not be thought of ; if it involves any serious fault on their part, it must not be admitted. The admission would be a violation of the position of a Government, and of the relation in which it professes to stand to the country. It is hardly, in fact, expected of a Government any more than a confession is expected from a prisoner at the bar ; the practice of the law is to tell the latter that he is not to confess; the plea of "Not "Gcilty," whatever be the real state of the case, is the constitutional answer which is put into his mouth. In the same way, in our political practice it is unconstitutional for a Gove-nment to admit awkward facts. The very speakers who rise in the House to hammer these facts into it, who bring them out with all the force of clear statement and vigorous rhetoric, and place them in full daylight before the world, do not expect that they will extort any admission from the Government. They know the rules of the game, and that an admission would be against those rules. Nothing would astonish them more than an admission of the truth of what they have been saying from that side of the House; they would condemn it themselves as a breach of etiquette; it would make everybody feel awkward and confused, just as a scene out of a book -would if it occurred in real life. They look upon a Govermuent as a convenient constitutional target into which they are mercilessly to sticlk all their facts till they have emptied their quiver. But they would be surprised, not to say startled, if the target began literally to bleedand to I moan-" Narn Polydorus ego." And, if the Opposition would object to Government admissions, the Government must a fortiori be expected to do so; tbough, after all, perhaps, C-overnments only forcibly represent the tendencies of human nature in general with respect to facts that it dislikes. What a power there is in the human mind everywhere of ignoring facts that displease it; how do people shove them aside, refuse to see them, vote them to be nothing at all! If men of thought and inquiry who unfold questions of science or history and bring facts out of their hiding-places concerned themselves much about the absolute and total denials which meet them even from men of professed,i sense and information, aU inquiry and aU thought would soon cease in the world. The supreme confidence with which men wiU deny at first the most certain facts is a wonderful phenomenon. But wait a little, and you will find that if your facts are true the admission will come even from Government itself, a little cloaked perhaps in cautious terms, but stil substantially there. Though political honour precluded it at the time, political honour has its limits of time like our pecuniaTy debts, after which it is free to speak. What greater instance could we have of the necessity felt by Governments of denying disadvantageous facts than we had two years ago, when an Administration went out simply because it would not admit the most palpable, evident, and notorious facts with respect to our army in the Crimea ? The most rigid hIaster of the Ceremonies in the political department must have been content with such a correct and complete obedience to Government etiquette and position. But wait, and the admission comes. It comes from Lord PAuorusE at Arbroath. It is true the present Ministry is not identical with the last, and it allowed the Committee of Inquiry into the Affairs of the Crimea, which was an express departure from the ground taken by the last Ministry; still, it has succeeded more or less to the delicacy, tenderness, and reserve in the admission of anything faulty in the management of that whole undertaking which characterized the late Ministry. But now Lord PRNmtUr.E is ready to talk of "the unfortunate state of the army in the Crimea, which aroused the indignation and excited the deepest sympathy of the British nation." It is true he feels himself somewhat checked stil by his official position, gently deprecates the censure of individuals, and apologizes for the gross mismanagement of the affair, as owing to our bad system rather than to the carelessness of particular officials. The people of England," he says, "are not a vindictive people; they can make allowance for difficulties; they will not avenge on a single individual that which was the result of a system." Well; but whether the mismanagement arose from individnals or the system it arose from something which could be mended, and which it was wrong therefore to leave exactly as it was. This was what we urged at the time, -ut we were told that it was neither an individual nor the system which was to blame, but everything else 'whatever,-the sea, the air, the sky, fate, the necessary inexperience of the first entrance on a war;-everything that was wrong was unavoidable, and could not possibly have happened otherwise. WYe asked at the time "If the sys" tem is wrong why not alter it r' and we were told that it was impossible to alter it while the war was going on; that the stiffness of new machinery was worse than the awkwardness of old; that when things were in a certain train it wras hazardous to put them out of it, even though the new arrangement might be in itself an improvement; and that, on the whole, it was better to let things go on as they were till peace was made, when of course the great reason for change would have passed by. We are glad to see Lord PAs.wurm now demolishing these excuses, and appealing to his own lino as the contrary of this over-cautious and stagnant one. "1 I was accused of applying too stoutly to "reform during a period of existing war; but "the fact was I found we could not carry on "the war without the reform, and I determined, "whatever the risk, to accomplish the change." * * S "% 11 I confess that owing "to the divided administration delays had "occurred which rendered the efficiency of the service almost impossible." This is pretty good for an official adrnission. To the gross awkwardness of the old machinery bis Lordship cals special attention, showing that it was not in minor and subordinate points, but in its large and broad outlines, that the system was in error; and that it was in error, therefore, in a way wlich appealed to everybody's common sense and caUed aloud for immediate change. " You "will readily believe the necessity for this when I "tell you that till within a year and a few months "the Commander-in-Chief had only the cavalry "and the infrutry under his charge. With the " Artillery ho had notliing to do, and they were "placed beside him on the field, or in some camp " adjoining." Such were the obvious and gross mistakes of arrangement, which, when we remonstrated, we were told must be let alone, and could not be interfered with while the war was going on.

EXPLORATION OF SOUTH AjErICA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIM-ES. Sir,-Being agent of Don IL L. de Oliden, who is the Governor of the provin^e of Otuqui., in BoUlvia, and proprietor of a large tract of land on the banks of the rivers lately surveyed by the United States' steamer Watenritch, I am enabled to give some further infornation on tho sub. iect of the report of the commander of that steamer, Lieu. te , in She ms of the 26th inst under be interesting to your The Bahia Negra, which Lieutenant Page ascended 36 miles, until he was prevented from proceeding further by a thick growth of water grAss which closed the psssage, is the nouth of the river Otuquis. This river, with its tributaries the rivers Tucabaca, San Raphael, and Latiriquiqui, waters the region which Lieutenant Page calls Otergip, but which is properly called the province of Otuquis, which was formed out of a part of the Drovince of Chiquitos, and is the south-eastern extremity of the Bolivian plains, nd these plains, commencing on the west bank of the river Paragnay, extend to the foot of the easternmost Andes anrd to the immediate vicinity of the mountain cities Chaquisaca, Cochabamba, and La Pxz With regard to the water grass which obstructed the further progress of the Waterwitch and which Lieutenant Page very properly thinks " might 1e removed, and thus an opening be effected which would give to Bolivia the nearest approach to waters navigable at all seasons," it did not obstruct that river a centary ago; because it is a fact recorded in the history of the Spanish colonies that when the Jesnit missions flourished an active trade was carried on in river crafts between the city of Assamption, capital of Paraguay, and the ancient mission towns of San Juan on the Tucabaca, Santo Corazon (now Oliden) at the confluence of the rivers (Tucabaca nd San >Raphael with the river Otuquis), and the ancient mission of Santiago on the San RaphaeLt- After the expulsion of the Jesuits the In,dians were made to work in she mnines like slaves, and in consequence all this trade ceased. "The art4" sa Southey, " which the Jesuits introduced were abandoned their looms feU to pieces, their gardens lay waste-their only alternative was to remain xnd be treated like slaves, or fly to the woods and take their chance as savages.", Under these circumstances there was nothing to disturb the luxuriant growth of the water grass, and in the course of a great mainy years it overspread the rivers in the form of a thick mat; which now obAtracts their free navigation. But there can be no doubt that this obstruction can be removed, and therefore d'Orbignv does not even as much as mention it when he decidedly pointed out the above confluence of the rivers as the most convenient place for the pert which the President of Bolivia had requested him to designate for the trade of that republic with the world. Considering the periodical overflowing of the River Paraguay to be an inconvenience for placing a port thereon, d'Orbigny says that, " Being forced to Abandon the project of placing the port on the River Paragnay, I conceived the plan of placing it on one of its tributaries. I recollected the size of the two rivers, San Raphael and Tucabaca, and, knowing that at the point of their janction their waters, which flow under the name of Otuquis, must, considering the magnitude of those affluents, form a river which is navigable AU the year round, I questioned the Indians, who told ne that nea the shores of the ancient nission of Santo Corsaon (now Oliden) the river was really wide and deep , After this I drew a map of the eastern extremi ity of the province of Chiquito.S and sent it to the Prerident of Bolivia, with all the information which I deemed necessary to designate well the important spot of the Republic through which commerce might be carried on with Paraguay and with all the other provinces of the River Plate, receiving through this channel European merchandise, and exporting through the same the numerous products of the proviDce of Chiquitos."§ I beg leave to trausmnit to you a note written bT G. S. Kernt, Privy Councillor of the King of Pruss, which contains much useful information regarding the refion visited by Lieutenant Page, and also regarding the River Plate countries generally, with a map of the same.

THE BOMBARDMEN-T OF CANTON. JA portion of tho following &ppo&-ed in our socoand editioz (BOX OUR OWN' CORRESPOND .) HIONGKONG, Nov. if. The London mail of the 10th September arrived here on the 2d instant, per steamer Singaporo, and we yesterday received, ii4 Clcutta, tolegraphic news from London to the 26th September. The Singapore leaves at 2 p.m. to-day with the outward mail, which is of more than usual politicsl importance. Unexpected events have occturrod at Canton, which has been partiaUy bombarded by the British fleet, and trade is entirely xuspended, most of the foreign residents having retired to Hongkong and Macao, with their books and treasure. The sapercilious and insolent bearingof theChinese officials towards the British Government and pmple has long required a check, which, being delayed, at last emboldened the Viceroy to insult our flag and refuse all apology for the outrage. The more immediate cause of offenco is as follows .-A lorcha, possessing a colonial register, and entitled, therefore, to bear the British flag and claim its protection, was a ichored off Canton on the 8th of October, when a party of Imperial soldiers boarded the vessel, sei7ed 12 Chinese of thb crew, whom they sent on shore, and, hauling down the Union Jack, retained possession of the lorcha. The master, an Englishman, applied to Her Britannic Majesty's Consul, who forthwith went on board. On remonstrating with the Mandarin offlicer, he was insulted and even threatened with violence. The Consul then addrssed the Viceroy, detailing the facts and requiring immediate redress, -which so far from beinggranted was distinetlyrefused,theViceroy appearing determnined to defend the act. Mr. Consul Parkes then communicated with Her Majesys Plenipotentiary here, and 24 hours were granted to the Viceroy Yeh to apologize for the insult to our flag and Consul. Such an apology not being forthcoming, Mfr. Parkes on the 22d October publicly notified that the task of exacting satisfaction had devolved on Her lMiajesty's naval officers. MIeantime his Excellency Rear-Admiral Sir Michael Seymour had proceeded to Canton, taking with hinm all the fleet except Her Majesty's rhip Winchester; the boats and spare force from that vessel, howvever, joined the expedition. The Admiral demanded redress and apology and a salate of 21 guns to the British flag, and gave the Viceroy 24 hours further to consider the course he was pursuing, ample warning being given that should he still refuse compliance coercivo measures would be adopted. Yeh, however, made no satisfactory overtures, and the tono of his communications was anything but apologetic. But one course, therefore, remained for Sir Mlichael Seymour, and on the 24th of October all save one of the river forts at and about Canton were taken by our seamen and marines without loss, the Chinese offering but a poor resistance. The guns were spiked, to the number of 170, and some of the forts were burnt, while others were held by our marines and a detachment of the Royal Artillery, sent up from this place, under the command of Captain Rotton, R.A. Some days were then alUowed to elapse, and every opporhm;ty was given to Yeh to arrange matters, if so inclined. The Viceroy, however, remained obstinate, and the usual Chinese policy was resorted to. 12 men, with chains round their neeks, were sent to the Consulate (not on board the lorcha, as had been demanded), purporting to be the same as were taken from tho vessel. They were, however, 'wretches of the loWest elass, evidently dragged from prison, and were, of course, sent bazk at once, and, all attempts at nerotiation having failed, on the 27th of October theEncounter steamer, CaptainO'Callaghan, opened fire on the city wall and the Viceroy's palace, the Royal Artillery co-operating from one of the captured fortm. Her Majesty's steamer Barracouta,Captain Fortescue, steamed up a branch of the river, and from a distance of 3,200 yards threw shot and shell into the forts on tho heights. A breach having been effected in tho ecity wall, it was stormed on the 29th of October by tho marines and sailors, led by Commodore EUiot. The breach was carried after some resistance, and the Viceroy's palace was also taken possession of and visited by Sir AL Seymour. Ouir troops vere withdrawn before dark, our loss for the day amounting to only three killed and 11. wounded. Further attempts at negotiation wero then made, but all proved frtitless. On the 3d and 4th November 'he old city was sheUed, and on the 6th Her Majesty's steamer Barracouta engaged and destroyed a fleet of 23 war junks, anchored in line off the small fort not previously taken. The Barracouta had hot work, and received no less than 80 shot in her hull and rigging. The Chinese stood to their guns better than usual. This fort was also taken by the boats of the Calcutta. Our loss amounted to three killed and two wounded. His Excellency having previously reconnoitred the Bogue Forts, at the entrance of the Canton river, they were taken on the 12th instant, after some fighting, by which we lost two killed and four wounded, one of the latter a midshipman. The ships of war in the Canton river are :-Sailing vessels.-Calcutta, flag, 80; Sybille, broad pendant, 44; Nankin, 0; Comus, 14. Steamers.- Niger, 14; Encounter, 14; Rarracouta, 6; Sampson, 6; 'Hornet, 17; Coromandel, 3. His Excellency Sir M. Seymour, in whoso hands the whole affair rested, has gained the respect and admiration of all the British subjects here. The patienco and humanity he has displayed, and tho unflinching determination with which he act have inspired the greatest confidenco. Througliout the whole matter the community have been kept fully informed on aU points needful for them to know. The factories have been strongly and efficiently guarded, and no precautions which care and foresight could suggest have been wanting to assure the minds of those most interested. The accompanying circular, addressed to the foreign community, has just reached us. From it you will observe that there is no immediate prospect of peaeo or resumption of trade, and it is for the present useless to speculate on the ultimate results. Such an opportunity has not before offered for revising our treaty with China and establishing our relations on a footing which may guard against the recurrence of such acts as those which have now brought us into hostile collision with the .hinese. It is needless to point out the position~ of vast importance to tho revenues of Great Britain and India which the comnmerce of Chitna holds, or the great extension of which it is capable, were our means of intercourse extended, as they aro with other nations. Now is the time for an Embassy to Pekin, having at its head some one of that high character and standing fitted to represent Her MIajesty int such a mission; but for this we must look at home. The views of outr home Government -will be anxiously expected here, and we trust that the high inflttence of the press, as well as of aU connected with Chinese affairs, will be exerted in presing the matter on the attention of Her Majesty's Government. P.S.-1l a.mn., Nov. 16-The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamer Canton has jutst arrived from Canton, having left at midanight last nigbh,.
AMIERICA. LIVERPOOL, JA-N. 1. The United States' mail steamship Atlantic, Idridge commander, has arrived with advice. from New York to the 20th of December, 22 passengers, and $68,369 iu specie on freight. The steamships Constitution, from Antwerp, and the Hermann, from Bremen and Southampton, had not arrived out. In the Senate a resolution had been introduced and adopted requesting the opinion of the Secretary of the Navy as to the feasibility of preventing accidents by tire in steamvessels. The House of Representatives' resolution relative to the presentation of appropriate medals to Dr. Kane, his officers, and men, expres-ive of the appreciation of their Arctic service, bad been passed, but the Senate declined to purchase the learned Doctor's narrative. A memorial from E. K. Collins and associates, of the Collins line of mail steamers between New York and this port, had been referred to the Post-office Committee. The New Yorlk Herald, commenting upon the memorial, avails itself of the opportunity of carping at what it styles " the opposition steamsbip policy of England." It says:- "Having no prospect of relief, Mr. Collins, wve understsnd, desires Congress to take his Liverpool line of sUamers off his hands, according to the original agreement, and thus close up the concem. It is rather surprising to us that the Western members of Congress, vwho, ithin the nast five or six years, have squandered sway the public ,omain to railroad stockjobbers to the exter.t of no less than -100.Oo,o000, should stand out ag...in any increase of appropriation to the maintenance of tie Collins line of steamers, and shouild oppose all appropriatione to the line on the ground of retrenchment and economy and fair play. The Illinois Central Railroad Company secured from the treasury A30,00,000 wort'h of public lands, according to the company's reports, tlO,000o000 of which only they have appropriated, and the road is finished. Yet the same men who fought this railroad job through as a great public measure wiUl oppose All day the appropriation of a few additional thousands to the sup. port of the only line of American steamers 'which pretends to compete with England for the mails and passengers across the Atlantic. We have reen, from what the Cun&rd steamers did in the service of England in the Crimea, the good uses to 'which the Government might instantly apply the Collins ships in the case of war 'while, as a peace estabhlshment, we should surely make it a point to defeat the opposition steamship policy of England, -hich iF by Goverznment appropriations to run our ships off the Atlatic oceau. Perhaps there may be still sufficient patriotism and wise discretion left among the members of the two Houses to save these noble Collins etea-nern from the hammer. Perhaps the railroad jobbers may still hold the balance of pdoer. Let the issue be brought to a fair trial and a final decision; but the driblet syatem wiU never do if we wish to hold our own against England." In the House of Representatives the furtber consideration of the bill reducing the duties on imports, &,c., reported last session, had been postponed until the' th inst. The discnssion upon the Presidents Message had been continled and adjourned. 20,000 copies of it were ordered to be printed. During the discussion Mlr. Walker, K .N., of Alabama, spoke in strong terms against the President's policy in reference to Nicaragua, and accused England of assulMing to control the fate of that country in order to promote her own commercial and political purposes. He said:- "To show England's Agency in fomenting the existing warfare, she bad supplied Costa Rica with arms, to be directed against Nicaragna, whose Minister we had received. The English Government had always assimed the right to oontrol tho fate of that country, in order to promote her own commercial and political purposes. He insisted on the importance of having some settled understanding wwith Central America, as through that country wve must have a transit to the Pacific to enjoy the rich trade of the East. ie did not seek to inculcate the idea of annexation, but that our country 'was destind to enlarge its domains he had no doubt." Upon the proceedings and prospects of Walker he remarked:- "Clouds seemed lowering over Walker, at whom all the eyes of the world 'were directed. No man had been more maligned than he. He was no vulgar adventurer, but endowed with all the elermlents that made a hero. If not a statesman, he was young, bold, thoughtful, scholarly, and self-sustaining. He went to Nicaragua for no vile purpose of plunder, and backed by no strong forces, but by the in. vitation of those who were fihting or freedomn and seeking to revive the fortunes of that republic. The President may have acted wisely in di.scountenancing diplomatic relations with Nicaragua, but Walker was at the head of the only legal power authori7ed to rule thereiu, and represented not only the Liberal feeling in that State, but, 'what is more important to us. he was the representative and type of our os-n nationalitT, and the instrument by which our rights, in future, may be secured and advanced. If it a impor'ant in Mlay last to recognize Walker's Government, because of the protection necessary to be affordod our citizens in that quarter, the subject is not surely less important now." It is stated that a large number of gentlemen from New York are at Washington endeavouring to get the Secretary for the Navy to furnish a vessel to assist in laying the wires for the submarine telegraph between Newfoundland and the Irish coast. The Nenr York} Jour-na of Commerce, in an article commenting upon privateering, protests against its abandonment by the United States, It says:- " In case of x war with Great Britain we may expect all our ports blockaded on short notice. In such a cace what 'would be the freedom of seas to uns, so long as our vessels could neither get to sea nor enter our ports without the aMost certainty of capture Privateers, being without cargo and full of men, 'would get out of port occasionaly, perhaps often, in spite of the blockade, and, when once out, would give a good account of thenselves In our view, considering the peculiar advantages which the United Seates possess for successful privateering compared with other nations, it is a question, which would requireto be carefully considere wZether we could afford to abandon privateering, even it merchant vessels were de. claredto be under all circumstances inviolable, except when they had contraband goods on board. But when 'we find that no such immunity is secured to merchant vessels, except 'when they are on the high seas, 'we cannot hesitate a moment as to the policy of abandoning privateering. It must not be done. Privateers are our stronghold. If European nations wish privateering abolished let tbem render us an equivalent for what we are called upon to At New York a preliminary meeting to concert measures for sending relief to General Walker had been held, and another meeting at the Tabernacle convened. Colonel Titus, of Kansas, is reported to have arrived at St. Louis, on his way to Nicaragua, wi'th 100 men for Walker. The movement among the slave population in the South continued to be a source of uneasiness; and, as Will be seen from the following reports, precautions to prevent intercourse between the coloured people have been taken - "1 Baltimore, Dec. lfi "The Alcr-andria aCc says that the rumours of an insurrection there have also been greatly magnified. " Louisville, Dec. 16. The correspondent of the Journal, writing from Campbellville, Taylor county, Kentucky, on the 10th, sa-s that a negro boy hd disclosed a plot of the negroes in that neighbourbood to rise about uhristmas-day. Several Arrests had been made, and an examination 'was had on the 9th before Justice Cloyd, but nothing was elicited save the sttement of the boy that he overheard the negroes say that they intended to make 'war on the whites about Christmas, and that if he vould join them they would make him rich. The negroes are reported to possess guns, pistols, &c. The correspondent adds that considerable dissatisfaction exists generally among tho negroes, which, if not promptly suppressed, may lead to serious trouble. " Louisville, Dec. 17. "The City Council of Clarkesville, Tennessee, instructed the Recorder to notify to ironmasters and other owners of slaves that no slave will be permitted to come to tbe city to remain more than two hours, unless accompanied by a respectable white person, under *penal1yof20 lashes. Slaves having wives and their masters' passes are exempted. Persons having slaves going to or from Christmas festivities are not to allow them to pass through Clarkesville unlesq a respectable white person will keep them together, and not allow them to mingle with the negroes at ClarkesvOle. " Gallatin, Tennessee, Dec. 15. "Thirty negroes harebeen arrested bere on suspicion of being concerned in the conspiracy. Tho citisens have appointed a committee to examine into the matter. "Cincinnati, Dec. 17. "The latest advices from Cumberland River state that 25 iron furnaces in that region have stopped operations, apprebensive of a negro insurrection. "Louisville, Dec. 19. "The negro preacber Anderson was examined to-day at Carrolton, hut nothing'was proved against him. He is still held on charges from Henry and Trimble conaties." In Canada the winter had set in with severity. At Montreal the thermometer has been 2.) degrees below zero, and the river opposite the city was fill of drifting ice. At Quebec the thermometer registered 22 degrees below zero, and a woman had been frozen to death. At Woodstock, Vermont, the thermometer indicated 30 degrees below zero. The New York commercial advices report a con- tinuance of the brisk demand for money which pre- viously prevailed, and no abatement until after the holydays was looked for, as the balancing of old accounts at the close of the year invariably calls into requisition nearly all the capital there may be reeking investment, The current rates for money were 9 to 10 per cent. for first-class 30 to 60 days' paper, and 12 to 15 per cent. and upwards for second class. Call loans were done at 7 to 8 per cent. The stringency had produced somewhat of a depression in the value of stocks at the first board, though it was considered that prices were remsrkably well sustained. In railroad stocks the transactions had been large, with a tenzlercy to decline in quotations. In exchange the rket closed heavy, aud U#tto busines was transaeted for the steamer Atlantic. The current rates were-for bils on london, 81 to 9 ner cent. premium ; on Paris, &c., 5f. 2lic. to 5f. l8jc.; and on Hamburg, 3Gi to 36g. For cotton there was a fair demand, at a general advance of 1c. per lb. Tlero was no material change to note in the pricei of flour. The trade were buying cautiously, but holders were rather firm, notwithstanding that the export demand had faUen off for the present. The business in wheat had been light for the week, owing to the high views entertained by holders. The season had closed for the receipts of wheat by tbe canals, andl the stock left unsold for winter use ras less than for several years past. The market for naval stores was dull, and prices had a dowrnward tendency. There was an increased business in the market for beef and pork, and an advance of 12je. in the value of the latter had taken place. The stock of Scotch pig iron having become reduced, to 1,500 tons, a bettcr feeling prevailed, and 2,000 tons hadl changed hands, in stock and to arrive, at $29 6Oc. and $0 50c., FiX months. The stock of English bars w as liSht, but firn. Sheet iron was dulL. Freights were rather easier, but xcarcely higher than reported by the last accounts. In the absence of business at remunerative rates shipowners were turning their attention to the South. The ruling prices from the Gulf ports were ,Od. to Liverpool, and lie. to Havre. At Charlestown, on the 19th of December, cotton had advanced ic., and middling was quoted at 12,c. The screw steamship City of Manchester, Captain Petrie, has arrived from Philadelphia, whence she sailed onthe 18th of December. On the 29th she passed the steamer Ericsson, hence for Newr York.

THIE JUSSIAY BUGBEAI? TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIAMES. Sir, -I have noticod in soveral of the St. Petorsburg cor. respondences, and in extracts from the Rtnsso.German papers, statements evidently put forth with an intention of influencing our present relations vith Persia, by conveying the impression that the Czar if about to join in the fray by means of e\peditionary corps against Khiva in the east and Astrabad in the south. The amount of men, preparations already made, lines of march, and general strategy are in fact already pointed out, and it is therefore worth while to discuss the probable amount of truth in these rumours, and to ascertain whether, on being sifted, thoy do not resolve themselves into the same policy of intimidation wlhich Russia pursued so successfully with Europe by means of exaggeration, statements of military capabilities, and which passed current until they so quickly collapsed under tho pressure of the Crimean campaigns. ller influence is, and has been for many years, the most powerful at Teheran, but it is to tho last degree unlikely that sho will, while holding in her hands the strings which move the Perdian puppets, risk another war with this country by entering and occupying any part of the Persian territory, as such a step must be a cas" hcJi with us. A- advance into Azerbijan would interfere with onrTrobizond trade, of the value of 3,000,0001. per annum, Tabriz being one of the chief entrop6ts, not to mention the political reacons which, in regard to the occupation of Astrahad and otber points of Mazanderan, would havo still greater weight in determining an appeal to arns. Add to this her great distance from a safe base of operations, the Caucasus yet unsubdued, and the effect of the recent war, which has so seriously drained her population, emptied her treasury, and annihilated her means of transport in cattle, and I think we may conclude that Russia will if promptly confronted, confine herself to exercising behind the scenes the powerful ann of her diplomatic intriguei in complicating our difliculties and retarding their settlement with Persia. It has been announced that the latter country will invite Russian cooperation; but, with the fact before their eyes of the continuous occupation, since 1812, of Talish, and the difficulties the Russians mado at a later period to evacuate Chilan, it is highly improbable that they will expose tbemselves to a rcalization of the fable which rxcounts the dilomma of the horse who requested the man to get on his back and assist him in chastising one of his enemies. But should Russia, unfortunately, again forco on a war,it is consolatory to know that, vulnerable as she proved to be in " ber Jce-tho Crimea, she is still more so in the Transcaucasus, and particularly in a conflict with us, the only Power with which the great populations of A.,ia Minor have any sympathy. Whatever may bo the Eluropean opinion of our share in the late war, it is certain that we have greatly extended our influenoe vith the Moslem popul lation, a rosult to be attributed to our generous troatment of them during the cime we subsidized and offloered the Tnrkish regiments composing the Contingent, our perseverance and eventual success in organizing tho Bashi-Bazonks, our lavish outlay connected with supplies for the army, most of which money filtered through Asia 31imor; and lastly, to the genius of General Williams, who has raisdA our reputation and influence in Asia Minor (where his name is a household word in the most remote nooks and valleys) to a pitch which it never reabchod before. They still marvel at the Frank wbo controlled with an iron hand ?Iushirs, Pashas, and Defterdars, besides the whole host of inferior cormormntg and intriguers, and restored the cowed morale Of A beaten and disorganized army and trodden-down population. Tho configuration of theli Asiatic frontier of Turkey would not permit her to be a neatral, however much she might desiro it; and the raising of our standard would procuro us any number of MIoslems we chose to entertain, especially in a war with the hated " Shibhs" And scarcely more detested Nloscovs." It is ardently to be desired that our Government will, whatever arises, cultivate most sedulously the present favourable sentiments of the great Moslem populations as one of our first interests; for, however much eaviUed at in France, your phraso in a late article, applying to England the term of " the first Mussalman Power in the world," is a strictly true description of our poition With regard to the advanco of tho 50,000 Russi1ans from Astrabad to Huert, gravely aunonnced to take place by the German papers, they would, if they attempted it, be decimated by the mere difficulties of the road, without seeing an enemy. The fertile valleys are few aud far hetween separated by arid deserts, fearfully hot in summer, and in winter clothed with snow, besides being harassed by some of the most warhke Turcoman tribes. A deal is s"id about Count Simonitcb having travellod the whole of this road iri his britscka when journeying to the last siege of Heratbut a considerable difference exists between conveying a Russian ambassador's " tarantasso" and that of carrying a train of Artillery and the innumerable wheeled vehicles requisito for the supply of a modern army. Besides, wo should not wait with our hands in our pockets tiUl tbhar advanced guard appeared, and most probably operations on a grand scale from the Black Sea would striko her such a blow as indofinitely to postpone her Indian views. Tho pear is not ripe yet, and for the present she must confine herself to consolidating her rule in the Caucrsus1 completing the Caspixn flotilla, and assimilating the frontier tribes-a task in which she displays greAt talent-before she can make tbe next step eastward, eitner towards Constantinople or India. Doubtless the intrigues cf Russix, conducted through her obsequious tool, Persia, may disturb us, but with the base of Affghanistan judiciously attachod to our interests in front, the doors of the Kyber and Bolam pasesone 90, tho other 170 milies in length-closed and the keys in our pocket-our rail Sstem compietod, and a rapid commumication opened by which wo could send large bodies of Europoan troops to tho vaUey of the Indus from home, we may safely look to a long lease of Hindostan, so far as Russian armed interference is concerned. Dangers, if any, are more to be apprehended from the ambition of the natives themselves, now that their energies are awakened by the educational movement and tho hberal system lately adopted in onr Indian policy. It ia scarcely worth while noticing the alUegod expedition to Khliva, Bokhara, and Bhalk, a sort of hop, step, and jump over the llindoo olsh into India, not taking at all into account the slight fact of a range of snow mountains separating those countries from Affghauistan, which, along with the passage of the latter country and ending with the foreing of the Kyber or Bolan, would form an agreeable pronmunadc mnilitaire of 1,200 mUies (the distance from Bokldhra to the nearest point of the Imperial frontier, Orenburg) before commencing the labour of the conquest of Indiax There is no doubt that the Ruasius are establishing wells guarded by posts towards Khiva, a process of sapping they iscovered to be safer than an attempt by a CoUp ds mcin. In, order to estimate the enormous difliculty of moving armies in those regions, it nay be as weU to state that Peroffski, in 1840, left Orenbuig with 6,000 infantry, a host of Cosocksn and 30 gmus; in spito of ervery precaution Cxpsrienoeocould suggest, he never advanced more than 170 miles of the 400 separating him from Xhiva, and, finally. vithout any encounter with an enemy, ho made a most disastrous retreat in the noew (this expedition being undertaken in the winter season, on account of water), losing all his guns and his 10,000 baggage camels, nd acquiring from that inveterate punster, the late Grand Dukae ichael the sobriquct of " Ic O{neirc qai (Wn'sl qu spi," his first oseorvation on seeing him being, "Ah, oile Pezofski, qmi acU pour dlc c ComtcMarc, resis qi Cit rCrui l Gic'ra Quiar'y rapas," alluding to the custom of the Imperial Government of bestowing (in the Scipio A1rrcanus style) the name of the conquest on the successful general as a title. Whatever may be the result of the present state of things, it is to be hoped that our Governmesit wil not admit of the mediation of the French-a policy pointed out as a highly b neficial one to the latter eountry by a French writer mnany years back, in the then very improbable event of a British rupture with Persia, and of a Ruianu attempt to advance her frontier to the CaspixSL It has been whispered that Mlr. Bourr6e's special mission to Teheran by no meea= smoothed the path of adjustment of tho eashem case, an affair generally charact-rized as RuoPersian trap laid for our Minister; but, lot these rummors be tsue or not. the present oWortunity of extending her infinitesimal influence in Asia will assuredly not belest sight of by France, to whom the arriva of Ferouk Khls, the special Persian Envoy leaded with the " Lion uand the Sun" for his Impera1IHaesty, and jewels innumnrable for the Empmess, will aSorD an exeu3efor doing tho amiable, and a li%Jtb business at thesa rnatime.

FORBIGN iNTELLGENoL - FRANCE. (A portion of the following ApPeared in our second edi. tion of Testerdav:-1 (FBROM OUIJ OWN OOF.RoSFONDXN-T.) PARIS, WEDNESDAY, 6 P.-H. The Plenipotentiaries nmet at 2 o'clock to-day in conference. They were still assembled at 5 o'clock, and it is thought likely that their deliberations -will be brought to a cloze this evening. What renders this more probable is, that the receptions of to-morrow (New Year's-day) will prevent any meeting taking place, and it is desirable to bring the matter to a conclusion as qkuicly as possible. The line before themt is already traced, and the questions are few and unmistakeable. They have been already studied thoroughly, and the Plenipotentiaries understand so clearly what is before them that in point of fact tlhere ought to be hardly anything to do beyond exchanging their powers, reading over the protocol as a nmatter of form, and signing. The Russian Ambassador only received his last instructions at 7 o'clock last evening. They were commnunicated to Count Walewaki soon after, and by him to the Ermperor. The letters of convocation were at once sent out, and the paragraph which I sent you this morning was communicated to the Mloiitel.r at 11 o'clock last night. The delay to which I alluded yesterday was owing to the Russian Ambassador waiting for the answer of his Court as to whether two Russian representatives were to be present at the deliberations ; of course, only one is to have a vote. The point was a delicate o-ne; Count Kisseleff having only been appointed subsequently to the treaty of Paris, and indeed having arrived in Paris only since then, was not presuled to be so well acquainted with the question as the other representatives. It was desirable, therefore, that M. Brunow, who on the last occasion was second Plenipotentiary, should give his confreie the benefit of his ex erience. The affair was, I believe, decided in that way. The Plenipotentiaries will have no cause to complain of the want of information on the point which they have to treat. If defective mnaps were the cause of the original mistake, wilfully or otlherwvise. new oi3es have been prepared by the Commission of Engineers on the spot, for the express use of the Congress. The mnaps are relatively on a large scale, and onily give the locality on which the difference occurs. A copy was sent to each Plenipotentiary, who was to have it before him on the table during the conference. The following addresses from Swiss Royalists have been received'by the Prefect of the Chaux-deFonlda: "Chaux-de-Fonds, Dec. 25, 1S5G. "Monsieur le Pr6fet,-In the grave circumstances in which our country is placed wve think it a duty not to maintain a silence which might lead to our being regarded as hostile to the republic. We are Neuch'itelois and Swiss, and we will co-operate with all our strength for the defence of our common country. " Consequently wve have the honour to inform you that we offer our services to the republic, and that we place ourselves completely at the disposal of the military authorities. " Please to communicate thisletter to the authorities, and receive, Monsieur le Pr6fe;, our sincere compliments. 'IT. A. WURFLEIN, " B. DUBOIS-DUCoUOMuN, , "A. A. ERIENAUD, TU. PERENAUD-W-URFLEIN." Chaux-de-Fonds, Dec. 25, 1S56. "Monsieur le Pr6let de la Chaux-de-Fonds,-Under the grave circumstances in which we are placed, and in which the country demands the co-operation of each of us, I would not suffer it to be suspected by my silence that I wish to exclude myself from what is doing for its defenice, or that I entertain sentiments hostile to the republic, to which I am voluntarily bound as a functionary by several oaths suc. cessively subscribed and faithfuly observed. I consequently place myself entirely at the service of nmy country to afford it may co-operation and devotion, either for the organization of assistance, which forms part of the attributes of the Committee of Charity, or in any manner ir which the authorities shaU consider I mav render myself useful. -J. CUCHE, Notary and Advoeate." * Chaux-de-Fonds, Dec. 24,1856. Monsieur le Prefet,-If, as an old m1.itary officer, I thought I was of any value I should have sooner offered my services to the Swiss Confederation; but, knowing my in. feriority, I remnained silent, the inore so as I was convinced that the dangers with which we appeared to be menaced were not serious. Now, thsat the position is considerably worse, and that the contingents of the Federal army are about to be raised, I do not wish that my silence should be interpreted as an act of hostility to the republic, to which I am voluntarily bound as a public functionary by several oaths successively subscribed ard faithfully observed. " I consequently think it my duty to declare to you that I am at the service of my country, and that I place myself at the dispoaal of the nmilitary authorities, being ready to cooperate with all my strength for the defence Wf the common country. "IPlease to transmit this letter to the authorities, and receive, Monsieur le Pr6fet, the assuranee of my perfect consideration. " A. DELACIIAUX, Ex-Major of Infantry." The followiing appeal has been addressed to the young citizens of N euclhdtel " Under existing circumstances the entire Swiss nation is rising with indescribable etIthusiasm for the defence of her rights and the maintenance of lier independence. For the same reasons some young amess of this town have formed a committee of initiative to invite all their fellowv-citizens to ssemuble on Wednesday, the 31st of December, at the gymnastic ground at the Terraux, at S in the evening, to take ineasures for the formation of a corps of volunteers which, at the asoament of danger will be ready to march with their brothers to the assistance of their beloved country. "Y Young men of NeucbAtel, we are certain you will respond warmly to this appeal. We will not remain behind, and we will show that we are worthy to belong to the Swi3s nation. " Neuch;;tel, Dec. 27, 1836." The iiiotive of -1. Furrer's mission from Berne to Frankfort is said, by letters from this last-named place, to be the following:- " Despatebes from several represenitatives of German Powers at Frankfort inquired if there were no means of coming to an understanding, and whether the Swiss Confederation would not be disposed to send a delegate t, Franskfort to concert measures for preventing the armed collisiou which was about to take place. It was in consequence of these friendly overtures that M. Furrer, the Vice-Pre,ident of the Federal Council for 157, proceeded to Frankfort, as stated." A letter from nFrankfort of the 28th of December, in the P-easse of Brussels, says:- ",It is positive that Prussia has signified an ultimatiun to Sv;itreriand, according to wlhich, If by the 2d of January the pinsoners of Nenchi, tel are not released withoul. trial the Cabinet of Berlin will not receive any further propositioln for an arrangement, but wiXl trust the decision to the fate of arnms, and exact from Switzerland the paymrent of the expenses of the war from the day when the definitive order for mobilization shall have been given." A Munich letter in the iWbine6a Mercury states that in case the Prussian troops should march on the Sssiss frontier a Bavarian corps, composed of two regiments of infantry, a regiment of Chasseurs, another of cavalry, and a third of artillery, will be formned on the southern frontier of Bavaria. The first detachment of the Federal troopsarrived at Basle on the 27th ult., and was to be followed by others on the following day. The Bsnid of the 28ath Ilt. says II W\e are assured that in al the communes of the Black Forest gigantic petitions have been got up, intended to be' sent to Carlsrulhe, praying earnestly that the Government vwould prevent the patsage of the Prussian troops through the territroy of Baden." A letter from Turin of the 28th of December recounts the llumerous offerings of money nade by varions towns throughout Italy to purchase cannon for the fortress of Alessandria. The writer observes that if this fact be considered in conjunction with that of the medals presented to Count Cavour, and the tvwo swords of honour to General La Marmora, an accurate idea may be formed of the state of public opinion in Italy, and of the feelings of the people. At Turin, Genoa, and other towns of Piedmont the inhabitants are perfectly free to subscribe as they think proper; but at Como, Bologna, Parma, Naples, Florence it is quite different. Any person convicted, or even suspected, of having -iven money towards a medal to be struck in honour of Count Cavour, or for casting caunon to serve for the defence of Alessandria, risks his liberty for some tume. Notwithstanding the dange;subscriptions are collected, and the lists are filled in spiteof allthe activity and severity of the police. There are persons who pretend that all those subscriptions have been organized in Piedmont, but the fact is otherwise. The Italians omit no opportunity of testifying their adhesion and their gratitude to the King of Sardinia even at the risk of their lives. Tle jfan Gamette of the 26th of December an- nounces that in consequence of the death of her Royal Highnews the Ar hduchest Mary Elizabeth, the departure from Venice of their Imperial Majesties has been deferred, and they will not enter Milan until the 15th inst. A deplorable event took place yesterday morning at half-past 9 o'clock at the prison for debt in the Rue de Clichy. A debtor, who, the Patrie says, was to have been discharged the same day, his arrest having been declared iregal by a judicial decision, was shot dead by a sentinel. The ,SiX&e adds that the deceased was an American merchant. All par ticulers are carefully suppressed pending the inquiry commanded by the authorities. From the number of complaints made by foreigners of the irreguilar mnanner in which what is termed " provisional arrest" is enforced, it would appear that the matter demands inquiry. When an Englishman complain,s the authorities reply that it is the fault of the British Government, whnich has never enforced its rights; an Englishman in France being according to the (Code Nabpoleo:"n entitled to the same measure of justice awarded to a Frenchman in England. It may be recollected that some years since the present l)uke of Newcastle, then Lord ,incoln, was arrested for a fabulous sum by a Polish physician3 and the eminent banker John Abel Smith was arrested in his bed in the Place Vend6me for a debt not due by him.

It is still far from clear to what extent the French proposition that is about to be laid before the Swiss FederalAssembly is backed bythe rest of Europe ;the general impression here is, that it is seconded by the other Powers parties to the London Protocol, and also advocated by the representatives of all other Powers accredited there, including the representative of the Unitod States of America-an advocacy which it has been imagined would, as coming from the .epresentative of a friendly Republic, have unusual weight. .But, whatever may be the amount of support given to it by the rest of Europe and America, it is not difficult to foresee its fate ; according to present appearances, that proposal must be rejected. Its first item is, that the prisoners shall be set at liberty, but at once required by the Executive to leave the country (" ex*7ldsio.l par ordre de police"); 2d, recognition of the King's rights to the sovereignty of Keuchdtel ; and 3d, negotiations writhQ a view to his cession of them, on receiving an indemnification. It is generally asserted that the French Government has obtained in advance the acquiescence of this Government to the terms proposed, which, doubtless, your readers will think was not very difficult of attainment; but it would be a great mistake to imagine that this Government, and still less the people at large, are satisfied with the fact of their being indebted to France for that support vwhich tlhy had hoped to receive from England. The Moniteny's article has just as much offended the atmour propre of the Prussians as it has that of the Swiss, though without infiicting on them the additional annoyance of taking an adverse part to them; but the assumption of the patronage, the qiwsiprotectorate over Prussia, the undue prominence g,iven to the "defiercce courteie,"t the harsh lecture read to the Swiss, calculated rather to embitter than to convince them,-all combine to make this country deeply regret that Louis Napoleon should have had this opportunity of patronizing and of putting them under an obligation they would rather be without. Your Paris and Vienna correspondents will already before you receive this have informed you of the intention of the French and Austrian Governments to station troops on the Swiss frontier as a corps d'obserration ; it is no secret that they intend also on the first pretence to cross that frontier and occupy the neighlbouring cantons, France occupying NeuchAtel and Geneva, and Austria the Pays de Vaud, &c. This may be received at once as a fact, certainly as regards the Austrian Government, inasmuch as certain authentic indications of thatintention have been given here already, and the Austrian press under the con.- trol of the Government is exerting itself to show that this occupation will take place by no means with a view to interfere with any military steps to be taken by Prussia, but rather to intimidate the Swiss Government into a yielding to the Prussian demands. This is the ostensible ground of the double occupation intended, but it is not the intentioni of either Government to let the opportunity pass by unused to call the present Swiss Constitution in question, and to take measures to prevent that Switzerland shall any longer be the refuge of the fugitive and proscribed. To the overtures made with a view to this end this Government has, as I hear, tirned a deaf ear. The time originally spoken of for the mobilization orders issued in Prussia was the 2d of January,; the 41)iui an of the Chambers, however, on that day for the despatch of business, and other motives, have caused a postponement of the day till the 5th; various reasons may yet concur to cause a further postponement, but it is looked on as certain by well informed men that the 15th of January, the day originally fixed on as the e.xtreme term, will not be exceeded. Whenever this mobilization order issues the marching of the troops will ensue immediately; in former times the order for mobilization was the commencement of the preparations-on this occasion it will be found that the preparations -will have been completed by the tinme the order to mobilize has been issuied. This period of January 15 coincides witlh the time the prisoners will probably be put on their trial; and it is evident that, when this has commenced, or the Prussian army has received orders to advance, the arrangement of this most intricate and vexatious affair wail have been rendered infinitely more difficult. The telegraphic information which has reached us to-day shows that a special envoy from the Emperor Loua Tapoleon had reached Berne, as ws presumed, bearing with him the French proposal, on which the last faint hopes of the diplomatic world are based; the Federal Assembly had no sitting yesterday (Monday), probably to give time for the Cominittee of Eleven to report on the Government message or speech at the opening on Saturday. MI. Furrer, the member of the Federal Council of whom I reported yesterday that he had gone to r rankfort, i ztateSt now to have gone on a mission to the variousSouth German Courts, to make representations against their permitting the passage of Prussian troops. Anotherportion in of greaterinterest, announcing, as itdoes, that Nlfr.Fay,therepresentative of the United States of North America, had left Berne for Berlin; doubtless he is about to make a last appeal to the KingofPrussiaforsomeconcession that may facilitate the arrangement of the difficalty before it be too late. Mr. Fay, who resided here many years as Secretary of Legation, is (in spite of his strongly-pronounced republican views) a person . sgrptis&ima in Berlin, and, if personal clairas to respect would advantage his mission, one might anticipate good success.
RAILWAYS 1? CE;YLOh,-Captain Moorsomn nember of the Institution of Civil Engineers, has been seleoted by Her Majesty's Government to investigate and report on the railway question in Ceylon. This wil no doubt lead to a comprebensive BYstem of railways being laid down for that island. The people of Ceylon may be deemed fortunate in tbus obtaining the personal services of an engineer so distinguisbed in his profession as Captain MIoorsom whose bold construetion and successful workdng of the Liccey inclined plane, about 16 years *go, startled the engineering profession at that time, and led to a speedy change in the system of laying down gradients for locomotive power. 2he subsequent econouical construction and successful worlcing of a railway through the poor and apparently unprolitae districts of Dorsetsbire sowed that this eonineer could well appreciate the comnercial position of diitricts requiring economical railway coinmurncation, and the Government seem to have exhibited a aatistactory foresight in the selection made on such antecedents for the benefit of the important and rapidly developing colony of Ceylon.
THE OVERLKND MIhL. [The following appeared in otr second edition of yesterday :- By the arrival of the Overland Mail we have received our private correspondence and papers from Hongkong to the 15th of November; Bomba-, 3d of December; and Calcutta, 22d of November. INDIA. The following is the letter of our Bombay correspDondent*. "BOMBAY, DEfc. 3. " No intelligence has reached us as yet from the Persian Gulf squadron. Indeed, I do not think we are to look for any till Bushire shall bave fallen, which event cannot, at the earliest, take place before the middle of this month. As to the temper of the Persians, and their preparations to receive our fleet and army, many rumours are abroad, likely enough in appearance some of them, but traceable, as far as I asi aware, only to the gossip of the bazaars, or at farthest to apocryphal masters of native trading vessels. Such as they are, however, their parport may be shortly described as waxlike and defiant-masses of troops assembling at Bushire; Russian officers present, instructing and encouraging; fortification of an islet in the offing, with a truly Muscovite prodigality of men and material, and many similar tales, direet from fable-land, perhaps. All we'know with certainty at present, is that Persia has not signified to the Government of India any intention of abandoning her proceedings against Herat, and abiding by the treaty of 1853. Nor do the authorities of Calcutta and Bombay expect to receive any such early submission; on the contrary, it is thought in the highest degree probable that it will be necessary to deipatch a further force of all arms from this port, and that shortly. For this duty the 78th Highlanders are named, a regiment of Native Iufantry (probably the 26th, now at Sattara), another troop of Horse Artillery, a third field battery, and one or two squadrons of the 14th Light Dragoons. Any further reinforcements would probably be sought from among those regiments of the Madras army which are stationed on the western or Malabar coast of that Presidency. "Of this same Persian business, and of the complications in Affghanistan which have given rise to it I have so little to saT that I have not said before that I am fearful of causing you to exclaimn, with a friend of mine here, to whom the constant talk of warlike preparations becomes distasteful, Persicos odi apparatus. Dost NIahomed was at Cabul, busy in raising and equipping troops for service on his western frontier, and discussing in his Council the question whether the present be not the most fitting juncture for pressing upon the English his demands i for the restitution of Peshawur to his family. " Upon one portion, however, of the general question, and that a very important one, namely, the nature of the road from Bushire into the interior of Persia, and the prospects of an anny advancing by that route, considerable light has been thrown by an interesting' letter that has gone the round of the Indian press lately.* The wfriter gives only his initials, but describes himself as familiar with the country, having served two campaigns with Persian troops, and traversed on four several occasions the road from Bushire to Tabris. Of Bushire itself and its defences he makes no account whatever. The very position of the town-exposed as it is on three fronts to the sea, and mainly dependent for its supply of fresh water upon wells in the open plain beyond the walls-seems to preclude all idea of a defence. But an advance upon Shiraz he regards as a very serious matter, and as certain, from the natural features of the country, to meet with difficulties which it would require great skill, foresight, and good fortune to overcome. The distance is 145 miles; for the first 48 of these the road traverses a levelplain; then cominencesthe series of steps bywhich the plateau of Shiraz is finally reached. Three most formidable passes require to be traversed. In onethe ' Daughter's Pass'-the road is described as execrable, choked with large boulders of rock, and at the widest part not exceeding 15 feet. ' Horsemen,' adds the writer, 'will have to dismount here.. In the ascent the rider's leg will be frequentlyhangingovera precipice perhaps a thousand feet in depth.' The ' Old Woman's Pass' is not less difficult and dangerous, and is probably, unless with very great labour, impracticable for artiller-. Another formidable obstacle lies in the rapid change of temperature, which would, of course, be especially trying to Indiansoldiers. Even the writeroftheletter in question, though inured to sudden alternations of heat and cold, was necessitated in the course of a march of only 15 miles to abandon light Indian hot-weather clothing for broadcloth and furs. Then, again, with respect to the commissariat department, it is said that the army would have to carry all its suipplies with it. So poor is the country and so few and so scattered the cllusters of houses to which the names of villages or towns are given, that it is often a matter of difficulty to procure provisions even for a single caravan. The plateau of Shiraz once attained, the writer is of opinion that an invading force would meet with compara- tively little opposition. Not only are the broad I plains of the tableland well fitted for the movt- ments of troops, but the dissensions and dissati-- I faction that esist between the Government and tie nobles might, if judiciously handled, prove folmidable weapons aggainst the Shah. " Vhile writing the above I receivedaslip of paper, emanating from the office of. the Lahore Chronicle, and dated at that city on the 24th of November. It runs thus .-I We have just received intelligence, on the highest authority, of the fall of Herat.' Of course I have no means at present of testing the truth of this report, but such it comes to me, nierely reminding you, en- attendand, that the same paper announced the occurrence of this very event some weeks ago, not less positively than now, yet erroneously. At the same time it is, of course, quite possible that it may be right this time. " From the North-WVest Frontier we hear of the force from Kohat, under Brigadier Chamberlain, having marched through the Meeranzie Valley to Thull, 60 niles from 1ohat, and 180 from Cabul. Moving o?wards from Thull it crossed the river Koorumn and entered the valley of that name, still keeping on the great road to Cabul. The thorough exploration of this road as far as our territories extend is one of the objects of the movement, and will be carried out whether the refractory clansmen submit or no. The Koorum was crossed on the ith, and up to the 10th, the date of the latest accounts that had reached Kohat, the troops had experienced no annoyances of any kind either on the line of march or while encamped at night. [ " By the electric telegraph we learnt yesterday, from Madras, that fresh disturbances had broken out in Kimedy. You may remember that some months ago the quiet of this out-of-the-way, I may say almost unknown, locality was broken by the disorderly proceedings of an aborigmal mountain tribe. Coming so soon after the Santal insurrection of last year and strongly resembling that formidable outbreak in several of its features, it naturally alarmned the Madras Government, who hastily ordered troops towards the disturbed locality. The affair was speedily put an end to, but it would now appear, though we at present lack particulars, that this sedative has not been lsstinog in its effects aud that the disease is making head agsain. " Hyderabad, the capital of the Nizam's dominions, has distinguished itself of late in a manner to which we are not accustomed. Ordinarily our news from that volcanc country treats of skir- miishes between rival mercenaries, of murders of men of note -within the precincts of the Court and almost in the very presence of the Sovereign, and of wrong, violence, and oppression in a hundred forms and in every grade of society. NoM, however, we hear that under the auspices of Salah Jung, the Nizam's Prime Minister, and the main prop of the State, an exhibition of the art-, manufactures, animals, and natural products of the country was got up at the capital with great success. It is true that the Nizam himself refused to patronize such a secheme, and, though he did not refuse Salah Jung the solicited permission to be present at the opening (perhaps did not dare to do so, knowing that the undertaking was favourably regarded at the British Residency), he called him several hard names and delivered himself of some of his choicest and most highly flavoured expressions of dissatisfaction. But the Minister was perhaps consoled for his master's absence by the presence of large parties from the British cantonmentsof £ecunderabadandBolarum,whoadmired and they deserve adnmiration, the gorgeous yet taste- ful embroideries or Pytun and Hyderabad. "I The Gaekwar (or Guicowar) died on the 18th of I October, aged 40, in the neighbourhood of Baroda, and was buried at his capital on the day followin . * We publish it elsewhere. The deceased prince, who wscended the throne in 1847, was a worthless debauchee, cruel, lavish, needy, and grosly corrupt. In his relations -with the British, which are now regulated by the treaty of 1839, he showed himself fickle and untrustworthy. Had he reigned many more years he would probably have forced upon U5 the annexation of his country. His brotherand successor, hovever, Khandi Rao, the present Gaekwar, is spoken of as a n an of good private character and of enlightened public views, who, if his head be not turned by his elevation, may do much good. to his country, and, moreover, preserve the Royal cushion to himself and his fainila "a aptain Burton, of MIecca celebrity, and Lieutenaut Speke, one of his companions in t.he disastrou3 visit to the Somali country last year, left thais yester'. day, in a sloop of mcar, for Znzibar. From that port, whienjoined by Dr. Steinirnuser, fromAden, they wil coummence their journey into the interior, in search of the great lake, or chain of lakes, the supiosed existence of which in that qiarter has been alluded to for centuries, but remains still doubtfuli " Lord IIarris is still on the western coast of his presidency, and was looked for at Z bangalore on th 2tb of last month.

COLERCIAL IN TELLIGENCE. BOIFRAY 'ATAPtRv (RFPOR-T FRO r NOtMBMEP. 18 to DzCFntBER 2, 1856.) The Overland Mail from London of the 27th October reached Bombay about 2 o'clock on the morning of the 23d November, per Peninsula- and Oriental Company's steamship Ganges. We have no change to report in our Mloney-market during the fortnight. Bank rates of interest remain unaltered, and the market on the whole may be considered easy. Government and other securities remain much aboat former quotations and dull of sale. h1SonTs. Cotton Piece Goods.-The market in this commodity has been steady since the last report, and prices on most descriptions have advanced slightly. The holders begin to show firmness. Business has been done to a fair extent. The prospective commencement of a. war with Persia has caused no material change in the transaction of business, and has only affected gray domestics, that were being purchased in that country. Gray shirtings, 40 inches, 41b. to 4,h., 91k and 101b., are dull; 61b. and7b. areinvery gooddemand,and 5ob. and Slb. are infairinquiry; 45-inchs, 101b., are dull, and 71b.to 7.-lb. are inverygooddemand. Gray MadapoLams, 21b. 10-16ths to 21h, are in fair inquiry; 311b. are in moderate inquiry, and 31b. are in great demand. Grayjaconots of all descriptions are in fair request. Gray domestics have become dull, especially those tbht were saited to the wants of the Persian market. Gray T-cloths up to 51hb are dull; while 5f 10. to 71b. are in good demand. Gray longcloths are rather dull, as also 101b. and unwards. Bleached and Fcacy Goods.-Bfeached shirtings, low, are in very good demand - those of middling quaity are moderate, and are inquired after, while the higfer ones are dull of sale, Thesame mayberemarked of bleached niadapollams.

Turkey red is in demand, and dyed orange and green are dull of sale. Bletals--Hoops are dull, and have doclinod a little. Swedish bars have advanced in price, and are in very good demand. Steel, in tubs has shtly declined, but is still in fair inquiry. Tin plates are in great demand. Lead, both pig and sheet, is dull, and has even declined. English bar iron and square nail rod have advanced, and are in good demand. There is no change to be noted in ths value of round nail rod and sheet iron; both are, however, in good demand. Copper.-Brazier, sheathing tiles, and bolts are in fair rTuest. Nails have declined a little. Quicksilver is dul, and red and white lead has advanced, and is in demand.

Saffron of the best quality is in demand. EXPORTS. Cotton WooL-There are no stocks of any kind gathering owing to heavy purchases made, which are being delivered as they arrive. Since the arrival of the last English mail rices have advanced, and the market has been very active curing the course of the fortnight. We quote DhoUera at 120r.; Oomeravuttee Ilir. 1X2a.; Compta, 114r.; Broach and Surat, 110r.; Mangarole, 10r. 8a.; and Szwginned, }25r. per candy.

Rape, Scinde is al3o in great request. tIemnp.-Tbis article is in good demand for local consuption omv. Sheep's Wool.-This commodity also continues in good deman. Opiuni.-The market has been somewhat unsteady during the past month, the first half having been marked by firmness; the latter became dull (a circumstance peculiarly remarkable) 2s the time approached for the allotment of orders in the China steamer, which sailed on the lit instant, and prices have declined to 1,050.r. to 1,055r. for 3Mundlesir; 1,045r. to 1,046r. per chest Indore. Complaints are becoming loud of the very unsatisfactory manner in which the Peninsular and Oriental Company grant orders for the drug. The China steamer of the 1st took on board 2,035 chests. Tonnage.-Freights have been pretty steady, and we quote for Liverpool, .X to 34 5s..; for London, 31. to 31. 5s.; and for China, llr. to 129r. per candy. Exc.ta, . Superior sterling has sold for 2s. 21d. until two days ago, when holders of C;bina-drawn bank quitted at 2s. 2 3-1id. Local bills and documents have been done chiefly at 2s. 24d. Court's bills, 60 days' sight on Calcutta, 9sAr. Madras, 30 days' sight, 99r. China, 60 days' sight, 216r. to 2l7Ar. THE CALCFTTTA MARKET. SATUtRDAY, 22d November, 1856. In our last report we announced the receipt of inteligence from London to the 10th ult., which had reached uq on the day preceding the despatchof the mail. On the 14th inst., the d.tk from Bombay brought ns London paper.; to the same date, and on the 17th inst. the Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamship Hindostan arrived here, and delivered her pack-ets the same evening. The commercial advices having already been anticipated by the electric telegraph and the Bombay d4k had little or no effect on our market. Mr. Lindsay's screw steamship England (the first of a line of mail packets rid the Cape to India), which left Dartmouth on the 6th August last, and was expected here a month ago, arrived in our port only the day before yesterday. The delay is attributed chiefly to the deficiency of coals. Various causes have contributed to curtail operations in our produce market, the amnount of business done being on the whole on a limited scale. We bave had but scanty supIplies of almost all the principal staples, which have enabled holders to prevent the market taking a dow*ward tendency, and the high prices ruling at the beginning of the month have been fully sustained. The advance in the rates of freight have likewise in a measure checked shippers from operating freely. In indigo some sales have transpired. Sugar continues high, owing to the active demand prevailing on the part of buyers for Bombay. Of rice low descriptions have engaged considerable attention, while the smal stocks of other sorts have prevented any large businezs being done. We have had less inquiry for saltpetre. Raw sili continued dull until the last two or three days, when it attracted attention, and some sales wereeffected in some insta.ces at the estremeprices ruling a short time ago. The incre,se in the stocks of -ilk piece goods has rendered the market, flat, and the previous value is hardly maintained. Seeds are keeping high. Jute is rather easier and the I market better supplied. We have had less activity in our import mnarket, which nmigl,t oe attributed to the heavy supplies secured by dealers since the termination of the Doorga Pooria holydays and the expected large imiports. III British piece goods we notice a fair amount of transactions, in some instances at 'rice,- a.shade lower. Gray shirtings have not been in such active denjand as for some time previously, and conseqI'ently the value has given wayslightly. Other descriptionls o1f cloths have scarcely experienced any alteration. An imlproved demand, however, bas prevailed for mule twist, of which considerable purchases have been made by native deaiers at a slight advance in prices. Our metal market baa continued firm with an upward tendency, althouglt the sales during the fortnight bave not been to s'.V extent. Money Nark6t-Although we have had no alteration in the rae's of interest said discount charged by the banks. money is becoming slightly tighter in the Bazaar, aud nativeL capitalists are asking higher rates. In fact we already observe -an advance of I per cent. on loans. The 4.1 per cent, loan does uot setm to increase in favonr as the payments into all the Indian Treasuies up to the 31st ult., sn¢.uisting to ba. 6,40,000, clearly show. This reluctance to lend mloney to Government arises chiefly fromn the appre- hension ,,raduaUly gainingz ground in all quarters of a five pe^r cent, loatn being SOoI1 announced, a contingency not very improbable under the pressing wrants wehich the Indian Geveruient haste meet. Shares.-We have not heard of any transactions latelr with tLe exception of a;sale of soeme shares of the Bengal Coal Company at Rs. 1,380 each. A handsome dividend is expected from the profits for the six nonths enaing on the .31st ult. At the half-yearly general inetw ef the Bonded Warehouse held t the 12cb instant a dividend at L1r. a-share wa declared. Bank of Benga dares ae held at 6,400r. East India Railvay Compxny's sha-es, on which 20!. have been paiLd, are worth 231r. to r. each. GovernMent Seclrities-In consequence of an anticipation that the Bank of Bengal would raise its margin on loans of Gorernment securities, our stocks experienced fartber deprecition, and at the early part of last week Comnpany's Ft were plahed at R&sl8 per cent. discount; but, no such alteration Iaving since been made, a reaction has taken place, and Coznpan Fonrs have ruled at Ra 14-12 o0 15-0, Sices Fours at Is. 16-0 to Ra. 16-4 discount, and Company's Fives at Rr. 2,-8 to 2-12 per cent. premium. on the wDole the operations have been on a limited scale. Exchange on London.-A very considerable busines has been done sine our list, at gradually advacie rate s.Te. raarket opened at 2s. 1gd. per rupee, but _s the rspply of paint was heavy 2s. I dJ became the rate of first-class bill at whiclifigure a large business wasdone.

We quote to-day 2s. 1Nd. to buy and 2s, 2d. per rupee to sell, but, as thee firs ave berrn current only for a day or two, the rate for tch mail may bo said to be 2-.j pe a Document billsmty be quoted througbhout asd.- per rueaoe. the rate for credits. Frelibs.-Slicethe eparture of the mail great activity has prevailed inL the market, and the engKagements of tonna,e as wvell as the chatrters of ships for Great Britairn, 'West Jndies, Austmrtsi, Us6uit-itnx, and Amierica, bare befn on a large scale, the rates of freights at first showing no alteration, but at the commencement of the present week assumig an upward tendency. Considerable tonnage bas been taen up for rice to London and Liverpool, and our closing rates are for the former place 3t. 12s. 6d. to 31. 15a. for 2-3 to i dead weight and J light good.N, and for the lxtter place 3 U7s. 6d. to 3!. 10s. per ton. For America a good business is in progress. For China very little has l.-en done during the pst fortnight in consequenee of the relncttnce of comm3anders o vessels to accept the rates now ruling for . voyage to China at this season of the year. We have in our harbour a good amount of tonnage still disengaged. CEIIYA MlARkiET. HON-GRO\G, Nov. 15. Between the despatch of the last mail and the commencemnent of hostilities trav.e was going on satisfactorily. All is, however, at a complete standstill now, andlikelyto remain so for some time to come. Freights are nominal at 2t., and all the vettels are now leaving Whaunpoa. Exchange on London, 4s. 7.d. to 4s. Sd.; on India 217r. From Shanghai we have dates to the 6th inst. Transactions in silk have again been large, 11,000 bales having been settled during the month. Arrivals are 60,000 bales, of which 56,000 bales are sold, and the balanoe is held for Jigher prices. Present quotations show an advance of $15 to $25 over last month's prices. Tsatlees No. 1-2 silk- left - No. 3 SM,5 No. 4 5300; inferior, $310.275. Throwne, $340 to $350. Tayssamis fine, none. Mfiddling to fair, $26 to 3295- inferior to middling, $235 to $260. In hck teastransactions have been moderate, And arrivals small. Prices are , tael higher. Green tea sales of 92,000 packages are reported, principaly for Amierica, at an advance of ;1 to 1 tael on good and fine kinds, but a decline on the common qualities of 1 to 2 taels. Gray shirtings and white are quoted somewhat higher, but the import market has been affected by the great scarcity of Shangbai dollars Sales of Frays are 110,000 iecaes, whites 19,000 pieces. Most transactions hate been in barter, or for sycee silver. The Chinese merchants and bankers have lately held meetings for the purpose of arranging a better system of currecy. Excbange on London, 7s. 5.d. to 7s. 6d. ; on India, 344r. per100$.; on Canton, 35^ to 3; per cent. dbcount. Freights to Great Britain, 21 for tea, and 51. to 61. for silk. Tonna abundant. From Foo-chow-foo we have advices to the 6th inst. The tea market had been active during the previous month, and prices had advanced 1 tael per picul on all congous above the commonest kind. Settlements of the month amount to 32,000 cheots Congon; 700 chests Souchong, and 3,400 half-chests Oolong. The unsold stock on the market is small, but it is impossible to know how munch has yet to arrive. Three vesmls have sailed for Great Britain, one for Holland, and one for Hamburg. A. good1 deal of the abovementioned purcbases of Congous are for tbe colonies, and the green teas for America The dull question has been arranged. &moy adviees are to the 12th inst., but anre unimportxnt.

DEFALCATIONS OF AN INCOE-TA&X C,ALLRMOU.- On Tuesday evening a crowded meeting of ratepayers was held in the town-ha l, North Shields, Mr. Aldertnan Pew in the chair, to adopt measures to protect themselves from a reassessment of income-tax made by the commissioners to cover tne defalcations of Tbomas Briggs, who had embezzled and misapopristed 1,7001, coUected by him in the Tyne. month in-district. The case made ont by the speakers at the meeting seems a hard one. Brigq,s who was a tobbcconist in the town, had been appointed a collector along with Mr. Joseph Philipson, a draper, for 197->4'. Philipson had left the whole of the collection in the hands of Brigg. Brigga had coUceted a considerable sm of money, becamo bankrupt, paid 2s. in,tbe pound to his creditors, recommenced business in the town, and is a defaulter of income-tax collected to the amount already named. No security had been taken frorn Briggs by the commissioners, and nothing can be had of him; and in consequence of some technicahty in the xppointment of Philipson, he also is absolved from loss. The commissioners have therefore come down upon the ratepayers, who this half-year, besides their doublo income-tax, are called upon to disbarse a rate equal to the money embezzled byBriggs. The speakers atthe meetingmade out a strog grievance, as they asserted that in Shields the tax was e. creed with peculiar hardship on the tradingand shipping community. When the tax was doubled, they said, nearly all the incomes of persons in the town, more especiaUy shipowners, were surcharged double; also that though shipowners were obliged to insuro their ships against sea risks, the insurance was not allowed as a set off against income; and though the loss hy the defalcations of Briggs had .arisen through the Government officials neglecting tosoothat his sureties were perfected, the parish was assessed in an arbitrary manner to cover tho loss. It was unanfunously resolved that the ratepayers view with extreme disapprobation, as unconstitntional and oppressive, the attempt to make a reassessment for the sum abstracted from the income-tax collected in the town; and that the Board of Inland Revenue be memoraized. praying that the amount abstracted be paid out of the general fund of the income-tax, and not by the individuals by w-hom it has already boen paid." Acommittee wa8 appointed to take every legal measulre to resi.st the payment of the reassessment. The meeting was addressed by some of the leading merchants and shipo'vners of the town and amnong whom were Mr. Alderman Mease Mr. George Cravwsbay, mayor of Gatesheod Dr. Dodd, 3Mr. Dodd, banker, MIr. flume, M:r. Proctor, and Mr. Baynes. DEATH FROMS STARVATION;-AXI inmjuest was held on Tulesday aS Dudley. before MIr. Robinson, coroner for WVoresterhire, on the body of an old man, namne unknown, who was foond lying in the road close to the towvn on Sunday morning last. Hie wras ink a dying state, and was conveyed by the police in a wheelbarrowv to the workhouse, but died before he reached that refu"e It vwill be remembered that Sunday wvas a severely cold day. A pest morcemn examination of the body ws made by Mr. F'msher, surgoon, wtho found a contused wound of about an inch and a-halF in length under the chin, but this would not have tended to produce death, though a good deal of blood bad flowed from It. The 4 stomach waas quite empty and coUxapsed. Several shots were found in the lungs, but they had evidently been there for a considerable period, and had noiS been tho cause of dea&h. Mi-. Fisher gave his dr'cided opinion that death had been caused by starvation, combined, with disease and exptosure to the cold. The armns of the deceased were m arke4 with Indian ink; on the right arm wasa*cradfix, and on the left a mnermaid and a " call to judgment." A number of peonle bad visited thme body. but he haid not been identified. Tho jury returned a verdict, " That the deceased had died from starvation, conubined with. dise ase,"
aYrPT. (FrROM OUR OWN0 CORRySM- I ALEXAIDRIt DFC. 22. The Peninsular and Oriental Company's stoa22er Valetta arrived here this day with the Lonlon mails of the 10th inst. The Bengal, from Calciqtt, and the Ganges, from Bombay reached Suez on the 15th and 1 th inst., and will rave to wait the c6ntract time for the Southampton mails, due by the Ripon, of wrhich there were no tidings at Malta 'when the V"aletta left that island at noon on the 19th iDst. By lsst accounts the Viceroy had, reached Assonan, and had halted there to recoire a Sardinian oflicerwhohas followed his Highnessup the Nile, and brings a decoration of the Order of St. Mlaurice and St. Lazarus, seatto the EgyptianiViceroy by King Victor Emmanuel. His Highness seems steadfastly bent upon pursuiing his journey to the Egyptian dependencies in the far South; but recent events in Abysinia, of which ve have just received intelligence will in all probability frustrate the con temy'lated negotiations with the Government of that country. It is rumourod that Orchi, who acq uired oonsiderable notoriety as usurper of the gterament of Tigr6, lately availed himnself of the absence of King Theodoro from the seat of Government to rise up in rebellion, that a battle has been fought. in which the latter has been signally defeated, and that Orchi again possesses Kull sway over the cottntry. The captain and crewvof the Myra, of Sunder. land, have brought intelligence of the total destruction by fire of that vessel, while ons her Way hither with a cargo of coals from Nwcvastle. The fire appears to have been the effect of spontaneous combustion, and its existence in the hold of the vessel was first discovered on the 4th inst., when she was in longitude 28 deg. east, and about 40 miles from the coast of Egypt. Water was poured down llpoII the cargo, but without effect, and Captain Hunt soon found himself compeled to have the hatches reclosed. All sail was kept on, in the hope of reaching Alexandria; but, unfortunately, little progress could be made, owing to light winds. Meanwhile, large quantities of gas appear to have been generated, and on the 6th inst. an cxplosion took place by which the decks of the vessel were completely torn up. The captain and crew took to the boats, and half-an-hour after they had left the vessel she was enveloped in ono iheet of flame. They made for the nearest part of the coast, but in landing the boats were stove in. At Arabs' Tower the crew were furnisbed with provisions, as also with camels and horses, by which they were conveyed to Alexandria, where they arrived on the 10th inst. The pilotage arrangements in the harbotur of Alexandria have often given rise to complaint among both English and foreign shipmasters. The reforms that are demanded semn,, hon ever, to resolve themselves into the two folloiing points, -namely, that the pilot-boats should receive strict injtuetions to display a conspicuous signal, enabling vessels to recogrni7e them, without fear of the perilous mistakes to which they are now liable ; and, secondly, that they should be required to go farther out to sea, at least sufficiently to be quite clear of the entrance to the channel; but in order to enable the pilots to accomplish this, especially in rough weather, when the precaution is most needed, it will become necessary to provide them v.ith decked vessels of greater tonnage than the boats now in use. It will, perhaps, appear strange that ships should still be Ro dependent ripon the assistance of pilots, considering that the principal channel leading into the harbour has been marked off with buoys and beacons, but it is donbtful whether pilots could ever be entirely dispensec with, and the absence of either charts or sailing directions renders the buoys under present circumstances almost quite useless. Some instructions have been published by the French Mo,Iitorw de la FlofUe, but it seems unacconntable that nothing has been promulgated either by the British Adnmiralty or by the Egyptian Government. The survey conducted by Her Majesty's ship Tartartus will probably lead to the publication by the British Government of the requisite details. The Peninsular and Oriental Company are about to introduce a steam-tug into the harbour for towing lighters to and from their ships and the Customhouse-wharf, and it may be hoped that their example will promote the introduction of improvements of a similar natute for the generl benefit. As mentioned in my last, the Sultan has granted an "irade" authorizing the formation of thu Rled Sea Steam NaYwation Company, by which regular intercoure is a but to be established between Stiez, Jeddah, and the other chief ports of the Red Sea. The capital of the company will be 600,00 0., divided into 40,000 shares of 201. each, and the privilege is granted for a term of 30 years. The necessary measures for carrying out the undertakinig are in progress, and an offlice has been opened at Constantinople for receiving the sulbscriptions of those desirous of becoming shareholders. It is said that the Governntent of the Porte has expressed. its 'wish that the uniform of the Eg yptiarn troops should be assimilated. to that of the Imperial army, a proposal which will in all probability encounter consideraole opposition in this country, for independently of the minoreconsideration that the Eg,yptian dress possesses the merit of being more gi-aceful mn appearance than the unsightly Stambouli costume, it is contended that it is also better adapted. to the exigencies of a warm climate. Subscription lists have been opened at Cairo for collecting funds to be applied to the erection of an E~nglish EBpiscopal church. The English residents in thtat city are not numerous, but the large numnber of tourists who congregate in the E3gyptianl capital during the winter months has long rendered. it desirable that a suitable place for public worship should be provided. The call h1 already been most liberally met, chiefly of course by travellers, anld everything seemls to denote that the requisite means w;ill soon be provided. Little or no assistance can, however, be expected from Alexandria, for we are still striving to obtain funds to enable uts to build the steeple of our chutrch. It will hardly be credited that the magnificent sumn of at least 12,0001. has been spent here for building a church, and that the resn,lt consists in an incomplete edifice, with sittings for only 180 or 200 persons, anld so ill contrived that the words of the officiating clergymnan can be understood by only a portion of his congregation. As for the external appearance of the bultding, some liken it to a muse"m, others to a Dissentets' meeting-house, but almost all agree that it lias very little of the ecclesiastical in its character. Mr. Robert Stephenson, the celebrated engineer, has arrived here from Toulon in his yacht the Titania. MIr. Stephenson is trAvelling for the benefit of his health, but his v isit to Egypt is als r understood to be in connexion with the railway bridge abonit to be constructed across the Nile at Kafr Laiss.

r - A CA 3IPA, G. IN PERSIA. The following iateresting letter has been addressed by a Britishl officer to the editor of the Bt,'s9tl Htcokaru., and is noticed in our summary of Indian intelligence "Sir,-A rupture with Persia appears to be inevitable; and as I have had some experience with its army, and am well acquainted vvith the face of that country, having served in two campaigns vwith Persian troops, and been four times from Bushire to Tabriz, perhap3 the accompanying observations, which are based on experience, will not prove uninteresting. I therefore proceed to jot dowrn such suggestions and facts as, if attended to, would, I think, prove of assistance, should our- troops, as propo-ed, invade that very interesting country. " WVithout further preamble, I would state that throughout the length and breadth of Persia there is not a wheeled carriage to be found, goods of every description being carried either on the backs of mules, yaboos (ponies), or camelsn ore generaUy on those of the two former. It is therefore abundantly evident that the difficulties awaiting the commissariat department of our army-difficulties greatly enhaig-d by other causes which I wilU shortly enumerateare almost insurmountable; for imules, ponies, and camels will have to be colected ere a step in advance can be made, and as I have found this a 1hard task even for the accomnmo da'ion of a smaU body of :30 men, it is palpably manifest the difficulty would be far greater for an invading army, if not altogether impracticable. When I add that, on occasions of public emergency, I have invariably noticed the charwadars (mule owners) have driven, or tried to drive, their mules into the mountain recesses, rather than emnploy them on publio service, it wiU be seen that the carriage for the regimenta3 stores, rations, &c., is an object of the first coneideration, and the greatest difficulty we have to contend against in our onward progress to the land we are about to invade. " Unless provisions are carried with our troops, they wil starve, for the nature of the country is such-the cities or towns so thinly scattered, the villages 'so few and far between,' and such miserable holes wben met with-that I have 3known it difficult to obtain provisions for a small kafi31a or caravan. " Assuming, therefore, that an army of 20,000 men landed at Bushire (a fewer number will not suffice to perform the work cut out for them, for our communication to the rear must, from the above cause, be kept open, and it becomes imperative that we conquer and retaini possession as we advance), the first and most important consideration for the C:eneral commanding wil be Ilow to secure carriage for his stores, ammunition, &c. The capture of Bushire need give him but little concern, for that may be effected with a couple of regiments. It is open on all the sea fronts, but towards the south on that face near the British Residency there is a wall, part of earth, part of stone, which could from its ruinous state be entered, when I was there, at almost any point: and as the Plersians never repair their buildings, I presume it is now even in a much worse condition, or has probably fallen altogether. There is no ditch, and the gates on the Alimidee side have doubtless lon" 'mouldered into dust.' Should, however, the enemy make a stand here, or assemble in force on the plain towards Borasgon, the General wiU have a splendid place of ground to manceuvre his men upon,and his irregular cavalry will very soon settle the matter. " But how to advance, that is the important question! Ile must halt til such time as he is enabled to collect a sufficient number of mules and ponies to convey the necesary stores. If he can succeed in effecting this, and obtain the requisite carriage for at least 16 days' stores, and others to carry magazine stores, &c., the first and sure step for the subjugation of the whole country wiU have been made, and his future progress, making Shiraz his basis of operations in the interim, will be easy and without doubt successful. " I may observe, en passant, that the inhabitants of E-ushire are chiefly Arabs, or crossbreeds between Arab fathers and Persian mothers, and are of the Mussulmsu sect called ' Soonies.' There is also a large sprinkling of Armenians in the town. The population of the interior of Persia are aUl 'Shiabs.' Bushire, therefore, is not particularly well affected to the Government of the Shah, while, the city being on the sea-shore, and the outlet for all the trade of the southern provinces, the population of it have recessarily been brought into close intimacy with Europeans through their commerce; more so, indeed, than the people of any other portion of the Shah's dominions. A diversion in our favour might, doubtless, be easily effected in this quarter, and, if it led to no assistance in miien to our ulterior operations, it would benefit us by securing our firm and undisturbed footing at this point. "After reaching Shiraz much may be effected by the judicious application of a golden key to the lock of the umderstanding of men in power. The country was ever the I otbed of rebelion, and every khan in it has ' an itching palm,' tliinking himself as much entitled to rule as those N ho rule him. This feeling is prominently evinced on the <eath of each successive Shah, when, as invariably happens, the standard of rebelion is uinfurled, blood is spilt like water, property sacrificed or forcibly taken possession of, and the strongest hand grasps the sceptre of despotism. The steps to the throne ace made over the lifeless bodies of the innocent as well as the guilty, for, to quote a Persian expression, ' suspicion often strangles a snan.' Much assistance night therefore be obtained by the judicious use of the yellow metal, and supplies obtained togetler with other assistance in the very heart of Persia. The very best thing to be done would be to proclaim aniother Shah, seat him on the throne, and keep him there. " The marchi from Bushire to Shiraz will, it is shown, be the most arduous and difficult part of our proceedings. The road and country around are barren and desolate, and I fear impracticable for artiUery. But wiUing hearts and hands may obviate all obstructions. I once crossed the mountains of the Kaflankoo, near Tabriz, in the depth of winter, with a park of artilery, and by dint of perseverance and energy we succeeded in doing so without a single casualty, but it was a work of infinite labour and difficulty -much less, however,thanthatchalked out for the artillery uf the present expedition in crossing the passes of the Pari-you, Kootal-i-Dooktah, and the Tang-i-Turkoo, all of which must be surmounted before the troops can arrive at the tablelands around Shiraz. " I have an impression, however a very faint one, that another route will be available for the guns of our force, which route skirts the Looristan country. If I am correct in this opiaion (I have never been by the route myself), I -v ould then recommend that the troops be divided into two divisions, the artillery proceeding vid Looristan, the remaining infantry and a portion of the irregulars by the usual mountain roads to Shiraz. A junction could be effected before reaching that city. " The daily stages from Bushire to ShiMa4 by the Kafiah r- as follows:-The passes to be surmounted are noted in the order as they present themsel"es to the traveller- Fursacks. hMiles. From Busbire to Ahmidee ... ... ... .. (; 1S From Ahmidee to Daloikee.. .. ... . 10 S0 llidway between the above there is the large viil lage of Borisgan, the inhabitants of it being celebrated thieves. From Daloikee to Khana Takta. ... ... 5 15 The Pass of Malhoo occurs between these stages it is very difficult. From Kbana Takta to Kazeroon ... ... .. 3 9 About six miles froum Khana Takta, on the road to Kazeroon, the pass of the Tang-i-Turkoo is met with; it is one of the worst roads in the country. From Kazeroon to Komaratch ... ... 5 15 From Komaratch to liootal ... ... ... 5 15 About midway of the above stages the traveller comes to the Kootal-i-Dooktah, or 'Daughter's Pass.' The road is execrable, and at its widest part is not 15 feet; many places are nearly perpendicular. Along the whole lineof the pass large boulders are scattered. The ascent is probably 2,500 feet. From Kootal to Rhana Zargon ... ... ... 61 19 About 11 fursacks. or 5miles. on the other side of - KootaUthe Kootal-i-Perigani, or ' Old Wooman s Pass,' has to be ascended. The roadway is similar to that of the Kootal-i-Dooktah, or 'Daughter's Pass,' and in many places regislar holes have been wom in the face of the rocky ascent byte feet of the u ules. The guns must be taken off their carriages to drag them over places of this description, and I think it woINld be advisable to prepare cradles in India for'this special puirpose; thev (the gpns) might taen be dragged by ropes over the dffliculties alluded to. From khana Zargoar to Shiraz ... 2-- ... ... ... ... 8 24 "The entire road by this route is a smries of steps, formied by successive ranges of mountwins, the patsses nained leading from one platform to the otler, till the beaitiful valley of Shiraz is attained. Throughout the whole finc, there are no places at which supplies could be (btained for an army such as must be sent, if I except Kazero,n, and . l.eoikee, but even there not in sufficient quantities. The fool of the 30 scattered inhabitants is generally cooked with cowdung, wood, except towards Shiraz, being very sca.co-in some places unobtainable. In some of the baudlets a few dried twigs may be had, wvhich have been collected on the ' chumans,' or plains. There is no cultivation en Xoute, except a patch of wheat here and there around Kazeroon, or a grove of orange or lime trees. The rations for the troops must therefore be carried with them for this portion of their march, and, as before noticed, when S iraz shall be reached by the army all further (serious) difficulty vanishes. " Bushire will be taken possession of with little, or, more probably, no resistance. One attacking party may land on the south, another on the north side of the city, if it be seemed nece-sary; tha' on the soili near the Residency flagstaff, 'on tho north adjacentkto the Bazaar. (The ships cannot go nearer than 2i umilesl. Oa any face of the city the troops will meet with no obstacle worthy of the name. ' The plain to the south of the Residency offers a splendid encamping-ground for the troops. MIake Bushire the dep6t for Indian stores and supplies of aU descriptions, garrison it with 2,500 men, station detachments permanently at Daloikee, the Tang-i-Turkoo, Kootal-i-Dooktah, and Kootal-i-Perigan, and a regular and safe communication might thus be kept up between Bushire and Shiraz. " At this season of the year snow will be met with on all the mountains on the other side of Xootal, and the cold felt severely by our Sepoys. This must be carefuUy guarded against, as much sickness wiU result from the neglect. After leaving Kazeroon the temperature becomes very con. siderably lower, and the sudden change, unless our troops are well provided with warm clothing, wiU prostrate many of the finest fellows among them. I have worn Indian siummer clothing at Kazeroon, and felt warm even in that; but at Kootal, a march ahead, broadcloth and furs were found agreeable, almost necessary, although from constant exposure the cold did not much affect me. " The same provision with regard to food must be made for the country horses. The Persian horses are aU fed on chopped straw and barley, and this or some substitute must bo taken with the Indian cavalry, for on the line of march from Bushire to Shiraz there is no fodder obtainable ; the little that may perhaps be found at Kazeroon or Daloikee will be quite inadequate to the wants of the animals. "In 1S36 I was with the Persian army of the South under the command of General Sir Henry Bethune, and attached to the Affshar battalion. To my certain knowledge many men were for seven days supported on a hetle parched wheat, and for nearly three I never tasted a morsel of food msyself, simply because it was not to be had. The army numbered about 4,000 or 4,500 sirbaz and irregular cavalry. If, then, this difficulty in obtaining rations attended an army of such inferior number, composed exclusively of Persians, who were well acquainted with the best mode of foraging, as also the country we were passing over, it is easy to conceive how this difficulty would increase and magnify itself to anarmy of India-of 20,000 men, who would be totaUy unacquainted with the country or its resources. The scarcity I here allude to occurred between Shiraz and Ispahan. " I have no time at present to write more, so shall conclude this first portion of my remarks on Persia with a brief description of the country to be passed over by our troops eu route from Bishire to Shiraz. "From Bushire to Alimidee-a level plain. From Ahmidee to Daloikee-ditto. Daloikee is a large village with immense groves of date trees and naphtha springs in abundance. Water bad here. Stench from the naphtha springs reaches the viUage. " From Daloikee to Khana Takta-a continued ascent, rocky road for the first mile or two, running parallel to a shallow river, which has to be crossed prior to entering the Mulhoo Pass. The river has a firm bottom available for artillery. The inhabitants as far as Daloikee wear the blue and red striped Arab turban, and the women generally rings in their noses. Earthquakes at this season of the year common. "From Klsana Takta to the village of Komaratch-road tolerably good, running for the most part between gently rising hills. Near the village rocksalt scattered plentifully on the hill. A tower to each house, enclosed by walls loop. holed, as also is the tower on all ith faces. Done to resist robbers, who used to abound in this part. Small stone towers occasionaly met with on this line of march, containing a small body of Tofanchees, a species of police, who, in niy opinion, were themselves thieves. "K lomaratch to Ka7eroon-good road for the first five or six miles, when it becomes rough and hilly. The Tang-iTurkoo is a horrible pass. Guns must be dismounted hereLots of work for the Sappers and Miners. Rock boulders in all directions. Mountains on either side commanding the pass. Strong detachmsents of skirmishers should be thrown out over the faces of these hills. Much caution needed just here to guard against surprise. At Kazeroon good limes and oranges obtainable at this season. "Kazeroon to Kootal-Caravanserai. Kootal is a partially ruined caravanserai, perched on a hill in the midst of lofty bleak mountains. Appearance of the place lonely in the extreme. Many murders have been committed here by the bill robbers. To tho right and front, as far as the eye can reach, mountains tower over mountains till their lofty cresas meet the clouds. The pass of the Kootal has to be ascended between these two last stages. The greater portion of the road of this pass is the solid face of the rock worn into holes by the feet of mules that have trod their way along its dangerous elevation for ages. Horsemen will have to dismount here. In the ascent the rider's leg will be frequently hianging over a precipice, perhaps a thousand feet in depth. "From Kootal to the Caravanserai of lhana Zargon.- The caravanserai, like that of the Kootal, is surrounded on all sides by mountains but much more cheerful in appearance. On the route the Kootal i-Perigan must be surmounted, after which the road chiefly runs through dwarf oak forests. The trees are of small height and girth. Wild pigs abound here, as also porcupines. Here an attack on our troops might be made under very favourable circumstances, and too much caution cannot be used to guard against it. " From Khana Zargon to Shiraz the distance is 24 miles. The road runs through the mountains, which are well wooded. After the first three or four miles of march road winds along the base of a mountain, a wide and rapid river rushing along some 200 feet below. Here an attack might also be made under very favourable circumstances, as the greater part of the road is entirely commanded by the mountains on each side of it, and these, being wooded, afford every facility for an ambuscade, and its contiguousness to Shiraz makes an attempt of the kind more than probable. The troops along this route will get good water and plenty of wood, but no encamping ground before their near approach to Shiraz. In fact, after leaving Daloikee there is not in the line of march an available spot for an encampment. Some thought is, therefore, required to obviate the effects of the sharp cold which the men will experience, as they wil not sleep under canvass. "I now conclude, and if yoa consider the foregoing of interest will shortly communicate with you again. " YoUs obediently, " C. F."
IZNDIAN R LWAY POJSEcS.-It seems unaccount able that among the projects for branch railways, extensions, &c., so frequently brought before, and urged on the public, no attention should be drawn to a country the peculiar capabilities and resources of which will soon render it one of our finest possessions; in addition to which it is our northern frontier province. We wish, therefore, to bring promiinently into notice a line of railway which, if constructed, would soon become the most important in India, either for pecumiary or commercial prospects; for we are certain it vould pay the largest dividend, in comparison with any similar length, of al the other railways in the country. Lahore, situated on the Ravee, is the capital of the Punjab and the seat of its political administration. The town is very extensive, and carries on a brisk internal trade. The civil station of Anarkollee, and the large military station of Mleean Meer, are likewise attached to it. Umritsir, the commercial capital of the Pinjab, distant 36 niles, is at least equal, if not superior, to Deliii in population and wealth. The intervenmg country is level, and without even a nullah of any size, and an intercourse of so great an extent is maintained between them that the road is iterally throniged day and night with every description of wheeled vehicle, horses, camels, &c., and foot ppossngers; in short, more resembling the street of a town than a mere communication between two cities so far apart. Umritsir is the grand entrepot for the commerce of the cis-Sutlej States-the rich and mountainous region eastward to Rote Kangra-the horses, fruits, and woollens of Cabul and Bokhara, the shawls, and other produce of Cashmere, Yarkhand, and the mountainous country towards the nortb-east,-in fact, of the whole Punjab, and the countries encircling it are here concentrated. Mooltan is a large town and military ttation on the Sutlej or Gharra, so termed after its junction with the Beas. It is quickly becoming an important emporium, for it is the connecting link to the trade of Northern with South-Western India, or rather Bombay and Europe. Kurrachee, situated at the mouth of the Indus, is fast advancing in prosperity and into notice as a seaport; it will probably soon be known as the first in the empire, being superior to Calcutta, Madras, or even Bombay. In a commodious harbour and safe anchorage it will become a depot for the commerce (export and import) of all Northern India and Scinde with Europe. The railway, now in progress of construction between Kurrachee and Hyderabad, some 200 miles higher up the river, will tend to promote its importance, as during the monsoon months the navigation is highly dangerous, and totally at a standstill between these two ports. Now the forrnation of a railway from t'mritsir to Lahore in the first place is advisable, and will pay magnificent dividends, with a small comparative outlay, particularly in the cold season. Admitting that the rallway from Utmritsir to Labore is absolutely necessary, an extension to Mooltan is likewise requisite, and must prove profitable. From Lahore to Moolt;m is about 200 miles. The intermediate country lying in the valley of the Sutlej is generally low, and sufficiently level, the average fall being about 2., feet per mile. In 1al0051 the tri levels between Loodiana and Ferozepore (higher up the river) averaged a fall of 24. feet per mile, or 1 in 2,000 feet. The geological features of the intervening district between Lahore and Mooltan are alluvial or firm sandy soil, interspersed with high grass or low hush jungle. The military metalled road was, I believe, one of the first in the Pun.ab, and is a proof that no extraordinary difficuIties require to be surmounted, as it is a melancholy t htawovenmnpulcwr in India, at all difEicult or expensive, cannot by any means compete with private enterprise; but, what with the red tape and occasional stoppage of funds, the old adegein the long ron is exempli- ied, "Penny wiise and pound foohish."-CalcuUa Rnglish-
COURT OF BANX1UPTCY, Ba=IrghaMUstrct4 Jan. 1. IN RE T. BAW. (Before Mr. CmeminSioner EVANS.] 'ne bankcrupt was an ironmonger, of Kingsland-road, formerly of Hertford. Mr. CHIDLEY applied on his behalf for a certificate, and attributed the failure to the bankruptcy of C. J. M3are, the bankrupt beinga creditor to the amount of nearly 5001. against that estate. Mr. Linklater, for the assignees, did not oppose, and the Court granted a second-class certificate. DI BRE HUPHREY BROWIT, TI.r Mr. LI KLATER appeared in support of an adjudication of bankruptcy in this case, as noticed in ThC Ti7nes of yesterday. Numerous witnesses having been examined an adjournment was ordered.
MfIDDLESEX SESSIONS', Ylhursday, Jan. 1. The January general quarter sessions of the peace for the county of Middlesex commenced this morning at Clerkenwell before the Assistant-Judge and a bench of magistrates. There were 46 prisoners for trial-40 charged with felony, and 6 with mnisdemeanour. The AssISTANT-JUDoE delivered a short charge to the grand jury. John Bambridge, 14, pleaded "Guilty" to a charge of baving stolen a a carriage lamp, the property of John Joseph Felton. Three former convictions were proved against him, and it was stated that he was a sharp, intelligent lad. The AssiStA~N-Julic. sentenced him to 14 days' imprisonmnent, and to four yeas' penal servitude at the Redbill Reformatory. Thomas Barker, 1o, pleaded " Guilty" to a charge of having stolen a quantity of lead pipe, the property of John Mtr. MErcm said he had received instructions with respect to this boy, and he felt it his duty to call the atten tion of the Court to what had been the conduct of tho prisoner's father. The prisoner had been guilty of pilfering ; be had been the associate of very bad boys, it was true, but his father was the cause of it, for he had deliberately done all he could to force this poor boy from his home into the streets, and, for aught he cared, into crime. The father had carried on business as a cabinet-maker in a respectable way for some years in Elm-street, Gray's-inn-road, but he now lived at 74, Great ChartWstreet, Pitfield-street, and kept two shops, one in Princes-court and one in Lamb's-alley, Hoxton. The prisoner's mother died about four years ago, leaving four children, aud the father then took a woman to live with him; since which time he had done his utmost to get rid of his children. This boy had been forced into the society of young thieves with a few pence to live as best he could, and even common shelter bad been refused him. The evidence proved the offence against the boy, and as he had pleaded guilty the Court would have to deal vith him; and it was to be hoped that the Court would, under the recent act of Parliament, compel the father to contribute to his suppOrt while in prison, so that parents so disposed towards their children might know that, instead of avoiding the liability of maintaining them, they were only entailing additional expense upon themselves by such conduct. A worse case than this could not be conceived. Mary Day, an aunt of the prisoner's, corroborated on oath the statement of the learned counsel, and, in answer to the Court, said the father's earnings were from 41. to 51. a- week. The AssisTANT-JUJDGE sentenced the prisoner to 14 days' imprisonment, and four years' penal servitude at liedbill, and said the proper course would be taken to compel the father to maintain him. Richard Donovon, 30, was indicted for having ibtained a halfsovereign from James Adaimson by false pretences, with intent to cheat him thereof. He pleaded " Guilty.' Mr. Poland appeared for the prosecution, which was instituted by the Mendicity Society. The prisoner had been convicted seven times summarily of obtaining money by fraud from benevolent persons. On one occasion he represented himself to be a son of Alderman Cubitt, and on another as a son of Alderman Challis. The AssisTANT-JUD(}: sentenced him to 18 months' bard labour. John Welch, 18, was indicted for having stolen a watch, the pro'perty of Charles Scott, from his person. Mr. uooper prosecuted; Mr. Ribton appeared for the prisoner. The prosecutor keeps the Blue Posts, in King-street, Regent-street, and one day, while he and his brother were looking at a fire in Grevile-street, Hatton-garden, the prisoner got close to him, and robbed him of his watch, which he was seen to pass to another person. The jury found him Gulilty. William Ware, 2f, was indicted for stealing a watch from the peraon of Alfred Proctor. lr. Way prosecuted, and Mr. Ribtor. appeared for the prisoner. This case was of the same description as the preceding one, a robbery committed in the street by one of a gang. The jury found the prisoner Guily. Former convictions were proved against him. Sergeant Chown, o E, stated that he took him into custody for being in possession, at night, of burglars' instruments, when he attacked him with a life-preserver, and so injured him that he was laid up for eight weeks. For that he was sentenced to one year's ard lahour. Some of his associates were now under sentence of transportation, and he belonged to a gang of about 30 of the most desperate thieves and burglars in London. Three former convictions were also proved against Welch. Both prisoners were placed at the bar, and The ASSTAsT.-JUDGE said thev were proved to belong to an association of thieves, who lived by waging a continual warfare of plunder upon society, and it was his duty to preventthem fromjoining in the depredations of that body for some time. It could not be expected that any good could result from their besng again sent to the House of Correction; that had been tried upon them several times without effect. The sentence he should pass upon them would be penal servitude, and the meaning of a sentence of penal servitudewas that they would be kept at useful labour during the whole of the period of the sentence. After a confinement of some nine months at Milbank, or PentonvMlle Prison, they would be removed to another place, where, in association with other convicts, they would labour on public works for the residue of the term of the sentence. In this country they would be sent either to Portsmouth, Portland, or Chatham, and if sent beyond the seas the place would be either Gibraltar or Bermuda, and on the expiration of the sentence they would be discharged in this country. During nearly two years which foUowed the passing in 1853 of the statute under which sentences of penal servitude were pronounced, the question was much considered whether good conduct of convicts detained under such sentences should be rewarded by any shortening of their terns. It was at last decided that the full term should as a general rule be undergone. Although such remission would not be granted to the prisoners good conduct under their sentence might greatly improve their sition as convicts, and render their confinement and punishment less irksome. The labour that would be exacted of them made such a punishment one well calculated to answer the pnmary and great object of punishment-the deterring of others from the commission of offences leading to such sentences. The certain detention during the whole of their sentences would give definite protection for a long fime to the body of society here against a repetition of the offences the prisoners had committed, and it was to be hoped that at the end of the sentence another important but subordinate object of punishment, their own reformation, would be sufflcientlv effected to insure their abstaining for the future from such courses as had led them into their present position. He then sentenced each of the prisoners to penal servitude for six years. Thomas Beales, a boy about seven years of age, who had to be lifted up by an officer to be seen from the dock, was ilnditedformsaliciously stabbing another boy named George William Charlton. The prosecutor and the prisoner were the children of parents living near to each other at Islington, and it appeared that they were p,laying at marbles, when the prosecutor, who was much the bigger of the two, kicked some of the prisoner's away. This led to a contention, and the result was that the prisoner stabbed the other with a knife in the left breast. T'he knife was an old one and the blade loose; had it been sharp and the blade firm at the joint, the medical gentleman who was a witness in the case was of opinon that death must have ensued. The jury found the prisoner Guilty, but recommended him to mercy on aceount of his childhood. Sentence deferred. (Bcfor'5rMr. CnxAsY.) Charles Tripp, Robert Jones, and George Holmes, surrendered to taxe their trial upon a charge of having assaulted and beaten Wiliam Claydon. Mr. Payne appeared for the prosecution, Mr. Metcal.e defended Tripp, and Mr. Sleigh the two other defendants. The prosecutor is a pianoforte key-maker, and the defendants belonged to the same business. The case was very complicated, there being a cross indictment, and there was a good deal of hard swearing. There bad been some disagreement, and on the defendants meeting the prosecutor they, according to his testimony, set upon him, knocked him down, anu kicked him on the back of the head, Jones being the principal assailant. The jury found Jones Guilty on the first count, and Tripp and Holmes Guilt, of a common assault. The defendants were liberated on recognizances to appear on the trial of the cross-indictment. Emnianuel Cooper, a Buenos Ayrean sailor, was indicte d for having maliciour' stabbed William Robinson, and caused him grievous bl.y harm. rhe prosecutor was a coalwhipper living in Perseveranaceplace, Shadwell, and the prisonerwent to his house one night, in a partly intoxicated state, and inquired for a person who was not and had not been there. He would not go away when desired, and when the prosecutor attempted to push the door to he pulled out a knife and struck at him. In holding up his arm to ward off the blow the blade of the knife came in contact with the inner side of the prosecutor's thumb, which it nearly severed from the hand. The prisoner then attempted to escape, but he was pursued and taken into custody. In his defence the prisoner said the prosecutor struck him first and cut his face, when he certainly did strike again. He said the prosecutor's house was a bad one. The prosecutor denied having struck first, and said his house was not a brotheL The prisoner was found Guilty and |Mr. CRIASY, having in the strongest terms denounced tlhe use of the knife in quarrels, under whatever provocation, sentenced him to nine months' hard labour.

POLICE. MASSION.ROtUSE.-Henry Arnold and Cha:rles Hurby were brougt Tup before the LoBD MityA'o chaTged vwith having stolen a cart and horse and 92 elephants' t-eth, and Zacariah Pickard was charged with having received the elephants' teeth, well-knowing that they had been stolen. Mr. Wontner appeared for the Prosecution, and Mr. Lewis attended upon the part of Arnold. The two former prisoners hadeen previously examined, and since that examination Pickard, who is a cabman, was apprehended. After an examination, which occupied a great length of time, the prisoners were remanded till Monday. The LosRVr MAYOR requested that the press would acknowledge his receipt of a5. 5s. from "U. A.," for the poor-box. GuiLDnALL. -John Ford, James Eglinton, John Blackman, Wiliam Stuckfield, Alfred Badman, George Saunders Flood, George Elkins, William Wiltshire, and about 20 other persons, appeared before Sir F. G. MooN, some npon summonses, andothers by haabcos from the debtors' prison in W hitecross.street, to answera charge of riotously assembling on the 31st of July last in Whitecross-street Prison, to the terror of Her Majesty's liege subjects, to disturb the public peace, and, being so riotously assembled, of assaulting Mr. r ames hIay, in attorney-at-law. Sir F. G. MooN said there was no case legally made out against any of the defendants before him sufficient to send them for trial, and thesunmmonsesweretherefore dismissed; but in the event of the City Solicitor obtaining fresh evidence the partios would still be liable to be proceeded against. Sir R. W. CARDEN said there was no doubt about the insubordination of the prison, but the evidence did not implicate any of the persons before the Conrt in the infliction of the injuries upon MAr. May. The court was then Ceared, and those persons who had been brought from Whitecross-street and the Queen's Bench 'were escorted back to their quarters in those prisons by a strong body of officers. Hlenlry Frank Carr, whose extraordinary account of a large quantity of stolen property found in his possession so imposed upon Sir B. W. Carden and iMr. Thwaites, the chairman of the Board of Works, 'was again bronght up, cha,r-ged witOh robbing his employers of property to the value Mr. Morn appeared to prosecute, and 'Mr. Wontner conducted toe defence. Some further evidence was given relative to a part of the property in pledge, identified as belonging to ltr. Meeking, of Holborn, after which evidence in a fresh case was given, in which the prisoner was charged with robbing Muessrs Greenwell, of the Blackfrinrs-road, in whose employ he had formerly lived. About 90 pairs of gloves were found in his box, 'which weaoe identified as Messrs. Greenwell's property. The prisoner was committed for trial on both charges. It having been stated on a fanner occasion that the nsoner entered Messrs. Meeking's establishment upon a alse character written by Mr. Alexander Lans, a draper, of Wimbledon, a summons was ismed against bimn for that offence, and he accordingly anpeared yesterday to answer it. From the evidence it appeared that, in accordance with a custom in Mr. Mieeking's establishment, the prisoner Carr filled up a form, stating, among other things, that he had lived in the employ of Mr. Alexander Hans, of Wimbledon, from Jnne, 1855, until December in the same year. This statement was forwarded to Mr. Hans for authentication, and he returned it with a note declaring the contents of the statement to be correct, and adding that while Carr was with him " he found him strictly honest, sober, industrious, civil, persevering, and obedient." It appeared, however that Carr was in the employ of Messrs. Sewell and Cross daring that time. Mfr. Wontner, for the defence, said he knew, upon the facts of the case, that a conviction must follow, and he was only addressing the Court in mitigation of penalty. This was not an ordinary case of sham character, where the persons, as is usual in such cases, are strangers to each o'her, and have a fraudulent object in view for their mutual gain; but, on the contrary, although the prisoner Carr had not lived with Mr. Hans during 1855, he had done so for the same period in 1852 or 1853, on which occasion his character was all that MIr. Hans could desire, and it was merely a wish to oblige a deserving young man, who had suffered much from illness, to enable him to get a situation, that he had given the character in question. Sir R. W. CARDES said this was a very important question, for if the defendant had not given the faLse character Messrs. Meeking would not bave taken Carr into their employ, and he would not have had the opportunity he had availed himself of of robbing them. Sir F. G. MooN quite concurred in the remarks made by Sir R. W. Carden, and he did not consider this was a case that called for any mitigation of the penalty. He therefore fined the defendant 201., and lOs. costs; or, in default, three months' imprisonment. Mr. Morgan said that, under the act of Parliament governing these proceedings, half of the penalty was due to the informer, and Messrs. Meeking, being entitled to that moiety, were desirous of placing it at the alderman's disposal for the benefit of the poor. The fine and costs were immediately paid. Sir R. W. CARD.ES requested that two bank-notes for 51. each, wkich he had receved from " J. R. H." for the poorbox, might be acknowledged in 7Te Times, in accordance with the wishes of the donor; also 10 chaldrons of coke, from Mr. A. A. Croll, to be distributed among the deserving poor. Bow-sTRET.-A dirty, abject-looking fellow, named Dennis Mahoney, who is well known to the police as an idler and associate of bad characters in the neighbourhood of Drury-lane and St. Giles's, was charged with violent assaults on Jane Power and Robert Cleave. The complainant Power, a woman of poverty-stricken aspect, said that at about 6 o'clock that morning she went mito a public-house in Broad-street, St. Giles's, to take a glass of ale. The prisoner and another man were there drinking at the bar. Witness missed three shillings from her pocket, and accused the two men of robbing her, upon 'hich they attacked her, drove her out into the street, knocked her down, and kicked her about the head and face as sbe lay. They both kicked her, the prisoner first. She was very much hurt, and was taken to the hospital, where her head and face were bandaged. Mr. HENRY asked if she had been up all night. The witness replied that she had not. She had only just got up for the purpose of having a glass of ale. Mr. HEnRY observed that it was a very unusual circumstance for a woman to get up at 6 in the morning for the purpose of going to a publichouse to drink ale. Robert Cleave, a decent-looking working man, said he was passing at the time, and saw the prisoner and his companion knocking the woman about. fe did not see the prisoner kick her, but he was encouraing the other, who did. Witness interfered to protect the woman from such brutal treatment, upon which they set upon him. The prisoner knocked him down and kicked him. He not up again and struggled with them, buat finding they were " too much for him," he let them go. After the policeman came up witness saw the prisoner near the public-house again, and gave bhm in charge. Little, 113 F, was on duty in Drury-lane, when his attention was drawnlbycriesof "Murder"from the woman Power. He went to her aid, but saw nothing of the assault. The prisoner was brought up on a similar charge about three months ago. The prisoner denied that he was the person who had committed the assault. He was in the public-house, and hearing a noise outside 'went to see what as the matter, when the woman gave him in charge. Mtr. HEXRY sentenced him to two mouths' imprisonment for the assault on the woman, and fined him ol., or two months, in default, for that on Cleave. Mr. HENRY has received 21. for the poor-box from T.P.B."; an acknowledgment was requested in Th Tim CZ. MAsLBoRouGoH-sTsET.-From "E. M." lOs. for the poor-box has been received. MARYLEBONE.-Mr. LoXG has received from the " Rev. F. H.," Paddington, 1L, and from * F. P. B." 21. for the poor-box. WESiNmsTER,-James Kitchen, a carman in the employment of Mr. Watkins, Ostend rabbit and butter salesman, Newgate-street, was charged with furious driving and doing very serious damage. Joseph Elardwick, an omnibus driver, said he was following his employment on the Brompton-roadi at about920 minutes to 8 on the previous night, when he saw the defendant coming towards hua in a light chaise cart at the rate of 15 miles per hour. Complainant called out to defendant, who endeesvoured to pul up, and in doing so broke his left rein, and the horse consequently swerving to the right defendant's near side shaft entered the chest of complainant's near side horse. There was abundant room for efendant to have passed on the near side. After the colls6ion defendant jumped out of the cart, and it was then discovered that he was drunk. It was here intimated that, as the value of the injured horse was 401., the Omnibus Company did not seek to recover any compensation before the magistrate, whome jurisdiction is limited to 101., but only proceeded against the defendant for the public offence. Mr. Wharton, a surgeon at the Consumption Hosoital, stated that he saw the defendant driving along tbo Bronmpton road. He was goin at a full gallop, 'witness thought almost 20 miles an hour. he lives of people were placed in imminetnt fdanger, as it as quite impossible for any one to get out ofhIS way. Witness apprehended that .some accident 'would happen through his fulrious drving, and following him, came up directly after the colUision. Duerendant, in reply to the charge, said that his horse jibbed, owing to being in a very light cart, which he was anused to, as he (defendant) had met with a previous accident that afternoon and broken his own cart. He wa?s only going at the rate of six miles an hour when the omnibu3 driver came straight upon him, when, to escape bein- run down he pulled the left rein very hard, and it broke. It was entirely the omnibus driver's fault. Richard Siday, another man of Mr. Watkins's, who was in the cart with defendant, was called by hin as a witness, and said that when the horse jibbed he wbipped it and it bolted off as hard as it could, bnt was only going at the rate of four mniles an hour at the time of the accident. htr. AieOLn asked him in what shtat the defendant was at the time? Witness replied, not quite sober, but not so drunk as to be incapable of driving. Wituess himself was qiite sober. A poheoemzd proved that both the men were more or less intoxicated. Mr. AiNOLl) said is was as bad a case of furions driving as could well be conceived, and fined the defendant the full penalty of 4Qs., and in default committed him for a mont, leaving the Omnibus Company to proceed against Mr. Watkins for the injury to the horse, WORSIrP-SMET.-We have received a communication from Dr. Winn, the well-known physician of Finsbuysquare, complainingi of the omission of a defence made for him by his solicitor, MSr. Solomon, in answer to a charge of assault preferred against him and one of his male servants upon a lodger in the same holseiamed Benham. We have referred the writer's note to the reporter, who states that he hardly rearded the observations made by 3fr. Solomon in the light of a positive defenoe, Dr. Winn's teal defene having been, in the reporter's opinion, extracted by his attorney from the m,,uths of the witnesses for the prosecution; and, Mr. Slonion's remarks baving been made after the magistrate had exprcs&-d his intention to send the case for tnal at the sessions, the tendency of them appeared to be merely to induce the acceptance of bail for the principal defendant, an object they at once effected. It is bat jus, however, to state, as tho defendant wishes it. that the defence alleged great and ropeated insult and annoyance, arising from a disputed nossession of the house; that, thongh it was ostensibly denied, it appeared that Dr. Winn had been termed a swindler, and a man who did not pay his debts- and that the actualviolence whieh caruso& the plaintiff'rs ightful appearance in court was inflicted by the servant, fromu excess of zeal for his master, whom he found en ed in ,Jfntest with the complainant. For this violence Mr. Solomon contended his clent, Dr. Winn, could not be held legally answerable; and, it appearing that the defendant had been 20 years in practice, was a most respectable person, and had numerous p1tients upon whom his daily attendance was indispensable Vr. uhniurzL took the same view of the matter, and liberated the defendant on bail. The rest of the report the Doctor himself bears wlling testimony to as beini both lucid and faithfuL CLEmtLm-%vxLLW-Louisa Reeney, a middle-aged woman, well-dressed, of No. 5, Featherstone-court, Featbersbtnestreet, City-road, was placed at the bar before Mfr. TVP.- wsn-rr, charged with stealing a female child, a year and a-half old, belonging to Mary TasselL a mxrried woman, residing at No. L, Princes-building, St. Luke' The ps;soner, it appearod, on Wednesday last was seen by some gentlemen in Britannia-fields, Islington, with the child. Another woman was with her, and they were ill-treating the poor chila so badly that they suspected it had been stolen and the prisoner was given into custody and lock-ed up, and the child was taken care of. John Lodge, 114 G, was deputed to make inquiries into the matter, when he traced the child to have been taken from the neighbourhood of the mother's residence. The prisoner was remanded. TiHAE.-John WilLnams, aged 27, a well-known thief and ticket-of-leave convict, and Margaret Edwards, 2.;, tho mnod ferocious and disorderly woman in the district, who has been repeatedly in custody, were charged with stealng a shawl value three guineas from the person of Elizabeth Wilson, who described herself as the wife of a master brushmaker residing at No. 13, Blackfriars-road. The prisoners were remanded until Saturday. LAr,E%m.-John Courtney, a journeyman shoemaker, Vws further examined before the Hon. G. C. NoRToY on a charge of cutting and wounding John Burke, and also assaultIg himsn a xverysavage manner. Prom the evidencea of the complainant, whose head was still bound n-p, it appeared that on boxing-day his house was surrounded by a mob, and several stones were thrown at his door, and on his going out to see what was the matter, he received a desperate blow on the head from the prisoner with a clamp, a shoemaker's implement, which felled biim to the around and inflicted a deep and dangerous wound. The prisoner and his wife also inflicted further violence. snd from the kieks of the former he was badly ruptured. Notwithstanding the severity of the injuries he received and the brutality of the prisoner, the complainant expressed his wlingness to forgive him, saying he had no wish to begin thene yearo with law. It was found, however, that his forgiveness was not wholly disinterested, for that he had received half-a-sovereiga from the prisoner's wife, and a sovereign from his brother, to settle the matter. Ir. NonrTOy, however, said the case was of too serious a character to be settled in such a manner; he should send it before a jury. The prisoner was accordingly committed for trial, bnt the surgeon who attended him not being in attendance the prisoner was remanded. *,* Ulnder this head in T7hc Timts of Monday was a report of a robbery said to have taken place at " the house of Mr. Cook." Mr. Theophilus Cooper, of No. ll, Hamptonstreet, Walworth, requests us to state that the robbery took place at his house.

DEBT IN FRANCE. TO TEB BDITOR OF THEB TIMES. Sir,-At this moment, when imprisonment for dobt is xbout to be abolisbed in England, it may not be amiss to inquire what is the position of British subjects detained in the French debtors? prisons. As the law of France now stands any foreigner may be arrested for debt on the simple declaration of a Frenchman. The 3faison d'Arrct pour Dettes de Clichy ordinarily contains 1'0 prisoners. Of these there are 20 or 30 foreigners, of whom several are English. The law recognizes that they are not prisoners, but only dctens, and does not regard them as felons. Nevertheless, this morning at 9 o'clock 3Mr. Charles Morret, an American gentleman, patentee of the vulcanized india rubber, was deliberately shot dead by a soldier of the 55th Regiment on gaard, when standing with his hands in his pockets at one of the windows of the prison which is public to all the inmates. He had committed no infraction of the regulations, and the mlurderer's conmssqrc in no way authorized him to fire on any one in any case; indeed, it ex. pressly forbids the sentry's musket being loaded in tho day time. The unfortunate victim was a married man, and during his residence in the prison was one of its most respected and honoured inmates. It is to be hoped that this astounding occurrence will call public attention to the position of those English who are unfortunate enongh to be detained for debt in France. Could not Lord Palmerston open negotiations with our ally the Emperor of the French to obtain that, in this respect, Britisb subjects.shall be treated in France as French subjects are treated in England?

SHIPPING ABaGSTRATION. TO THE; EDITOR OF THE TUMES. Sir,-The foltowing notification having appeared in Thc Timcs of the 30th inst.,-" Tho departures from the port of London for the Australian colonies during the past weelz have comprised three vessels with an aggregate capacity of 2,400 tons,"-I hail this recognition by *7c Timcv of the term " capacity" in connexion with shipping as the first step towards the establishment of a practically useful, because truthful, system of shipping-registration-a matter of enormous importance to pubbc interests. The present system of tonnage admeasarement for registration, maldng no direct reference whatever either to the weight of the ship hersetf, as 4etermined by her light draught displacement, or to the load displacement, the difference between these two being the measure of the capability of a ship for carrying weight, it follows that the registered tonnace of ships does not indicate the tons weight with which ships may be loaded fit for sea. The fact is that ships may be so constructed for the express purpose of evading the present law of tonnage admeazurement for registration that a vessel of 100 tons register tonnage may be built to carry 100 tons weight of cargo, or, on the other hand, a ship of _1,0w tons register tonnage may he so proportioned and built as to be too deep5ly imu menred for sea even at ber launching draught. To get tho better of these anomalies the term "' capacity" for cargo requires to be recognized, as now done by Tlh ni7mw, in addi.ion to the term ' tonnage," or capability for carrying weight of cargo. Nothing but delusion can result from capacity being made the measure of tonnage, thus confonnding the two to-ther, as is the case under our present system of shipping regi.stration, a delusion obnoxious to public interests, and utterly subversive of all daa AvLilable to science for deerinhining the relative locomotive qualities of diffcrent proportions and types of build. Thus scienoce is defcatedfrombeing Rpplied to shipping improvementbased on experience. Althougi the expression "aggregate capacity of 2,400 tons" is indefinite as respects the word "tons" (for by mercantile usage, a ton of cargo b7 measurement is 40 cubic feet, but I cubic feet of capacty for cargo constitutes a registered ton, and consequently we don't knov whether the three ships referred to would carry 6,000 tons measuremerit of cargo, or only 2,400), the recognition by The Times of the word "capacity," as a*lied to shipping, is the beginning of a reformation in shiping registration wboreby ships will be desiKnated not oxly by their " capacity," or capability for holding bulk, but also by their " tounage," or capacity for carrying weight, the one being no measure or cnterion whatever of the other; both should be registered. By such a system of registration ptxlic interests wonld be benefitted, as they always are benefitted, by truth being established in opposition to delusion. I am, Sir, your most obedient servant.

THE UNITED STATES. -- - -- w (FIOM OV1I NEWV YOIK CORRESrONDENT.) NEW YORK, DEc. 20. WS'inlter is upon Us at last in its most unendurable shape,-a dry air, bitter cold, with the wvesterly wvinds whirling the dust, which the negligent authorities leave on Broadway, in masses throug h the air. Our streets are, nerertheless, gay with decorations in honour of approaching I Christmas, and especially of "Santa C ' whose festivities are observed with time-honoured respect and devotion by the younger portion of the population of New York. Christmas is close at hand, and Congress has done nothing. A month has been wasted in prolonged discussions upon the Message, wlhich, to the outvward eye, seem only the prolongation of the agitation of the canvass. Inwardly they have a deeper meaning. They are not designed to act upon the fortunes of the Republicans. They are the upheavings from discordant troubles in the ranks of the victors. Within the next two months must be decided the important question who shaU rule in the new dynasty,-whether moderate counsels shall guide it, or whether the objectionable planks of the Cincinnati platform, instead of being put away as old rubbish that have served their purpose, shall be put square under the feet and made the main prop of the President elect. Mr. Buchanan himnself continues the wise course -which he has observed since the election was over. Pohticians of all shades have sought to penetrate his silence, and newspapers have sent correspondents to watch his daily motions. But no one has yet been able to say that he has a right to declare this, that, or the other thing of the new President's course. That it will be moderate to an extent that will be unsatisfactory to the extreme South I have reason to believe. The indications thus faN of his selections for members of his Cabinet show this. That a seat will be tendered to MIr. Cobb, of Georgia, and to Mr. Br,ght, of Indiana, I regard as most probable. Each of these gentlemien belongs to the Conservative wing of the party. The R Ich7mo 1 Enu1irer, in advance, forew'arns 2Ir. Buchanan of any attempt at compromiiise with iNorthern feelings. The5South, it says, will be content with nothing short of the legality of the extension of slavery; Mr. Bnchanan must come up to that mark, or he won't do for them. Meanwhile a case has just been argued in the Supreme Coiurt of the United States at WNashington -the Court have taken it for consideration-wlhich may settle the whole question of the constitutionality of the aissouri Compromise and the powers of Congress over the territories, without the help of Congress. A Missouri gentleman, travelling into the unorganized territories beyond that State before the passage of the Nebraska-Kansas biU had repealed the Missouri compromise, carried with him a body-slave by the name of Dred Scott. Dred remained there with him, and subsequently| voluntarily returned to Missou;ri. He now suies for' his freedom, claiming that, by the voluntary act of his master, he wasmade free when taken into territory from whiclh slavery was excluded by act of Congaess. To this several replications are made, on some of which the case may torn without reaching the question that now agitates the public mind. The arguments of counsel, however, have rested on the main issue,-whether the act of Congress, known as the Mlissouri Compromise, was constitutional; whether slavery, therefore, was at that tinie excluded from the territory by positive law ; and whether, if not so excluded, Southern gentlemen have not the right, without the shield of positive legislation, to carry their slave property upon the territories belonging to the `ederal Governmient. If the Court pass bv the minor issues and meet the main question, it miay be decided for ever, and one great bone of contention be taken from the halls of Congress. The uneasy feeling in the South about the negroes still continues. Fromu Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas the local papers come with more or less notes of alarm. Even in Virginia, and in the very neighbourhood of the national Capitol, negroes have been arrested and -whipped upon suspicion. From all quarters Christmas holydays are pointed out as the time for the supposed insurrection, and masters are urged to see well tbat their slaves are at home at night. Twenty-five of the iron furnaces in Tennessee have been closed in apprehensioni of the rising. I send you telegraphic extracts, which show the extent of the alarm. I believe myself, from all I can learni, that the thinig is exaggerated by local fear. There is no coiicealinc the fact, however, that the apprehension is deep-s0eated and spreads over a wide coutntry, and it is perhaps the best commentary that can be given upon the i_ngeniois defence of slavery as a divine blessing vhich the new school of Soutlhern politicians have discovered. The Piid.nwnd EThlircr draws from it the following characteristic eonclusions From these insurrectionary movements we may deduce an illustration of the utter folly of the proposition to revive the Africaii slave trade. XegNoes rf some inteUigeniec are not to be deceived into such chonerical and suicidal schemes. They originate in the blind passions of the ignorant and brutal mass-a mass to which it is the interest of the South to make no addition froin the savagewvilds of Africa. To-niiglit a great meeting is to come off at the Tabernacle, to aid 'the Aimerican citizens in Nicragua who are in a critical positiOnl in consequience of ther efforts to relieve that country from the weight of foreignl despots (in big letters), and who are strving to extend the bounds of freedom, &c." The objectionable Judge Lecompte (in Kansas) has been removed, and a gentleman named HLarrison, one of the exectors of Mlr. Clay's wrill, appointed in his place. The proprietors of the Collins line of steamships have petitioned Congress to take the line odf their hands and close up the concern. The Adriatic still lies at the dock on the East River, her engines not yet completed. Tile +Y,-e. Yo,lk Timws publishes the following extract from a letter from General Walker to a frienil in New York. The account he gives f himself does not agree very well with other published accounts:- "Virgin Bay, Mondaj, Dec. 1. " You will doubtless, get fuU accouints of the la.e events here irom the newspapers. I consider that our permaneent power in Central Anwerica never has been on as firm a basis as now., nor do I know of one sing,le month since I have been in N icaragua wherein we have made as nimuch progress towards final results as the month which has just ended.

AxOTI.E2R ( U?.o-rrT .IVULZRY AT DEi:rY.-In TlIic Ti ,ei.f of yesternlv (Thar.r.day; we gave nn account of a garotte robbery at Derby or. Saturday eveling last.

IRELAND. (FROM OU OWN CORRESP2ONDZnT.) DUBLIN, THURSDAY MORZING. THE BROADSTONE TRAGEDY. For several days past the Dublin journals have preserved a total silence with regard to the investigation still said to be in progress at the Broadstone terminus. K,aunders' Newsletter, however, of this morning again refers to the mystery, and to the inexplicable line of conduct pursued by the authorities:- "Notwithstanding the lapse of time, which usually exercises a contrary effect, the pr,blic mind is still in a feverish and painfully unsettled state with regard to the Broadstone murder, and the studied reserve maintained by the authorities tends rather to heighten than to diminish this sentiment. Day after day the assurance is given that the police have the guilty party or parties; that they have evidence against him or them to a considerable extent; and that a link only is required to insure conviction. It is known that for days, almost for weeks past, authorities in high official positions have been expecting an arrest to take place alniost momentarily, and that parties of police have been more thaa once actuaDy told off for that duty; and yet from day to day the eventis deferred, and the investigation appears to recede from rather than to approach a climax. To this is added the distressina belief-resting on more than mere surmise-that opinions are divided at head-quarters as to the course to be adopted; that the police and high Government officials look on the testimony that can be brought forward as conclusive; while the Crown lawyers, with whom the decision rests, shrink from advising a prosecutionuponthe case as laidbefore them. Ithas beenlongmorethanwhispered as a subjectof remark thatthe Crown solicitor,who atthe outset took a very active part in the examinat ion of persons in connexion with the railway, ceased some weeks ago to attend at the Broadstone'. and some go so far as to affirm that his withdrawal was occasioned by objections on constitutional grounds to the course adopted by the police towards certain of the parties upon whom suspicion in the first instance rested. All agree that either an arrest or the total abandonment of the inquiry must speedily take place. What are the public to think? Are the police acting upon sure information, and are they baffled by superior skill, or does suspicion rest upon the vildest surmise? In justice to the persons who are not guilty, but upon whom the cloud of suspicion rests-as is at present the case with nearly everything and everybody connected with the Midland Railway-in vindication of their own name and exertions, and in mercy to the public, the police ought to adopt some course without delay, which would enable them, as far as is consistent with the ends of justice, to publish the information in their hands regarding this mysterious tragedy. One observation is due to themthey did not bring forwe-d or in any way interfere as prosecutors in the charge preferred against Harrington ; on the contrary, they declared from the first that they were not in any way mixed up with it; aud it is surprising how such a mistake could have been fallen into, when this explicit declaration was published at the time." THE MARQUIS OF WATERFORD. A local paper gives the annexed account of the accident to the Marquis of Waterford, and which, fortunately, was not of so serious a nature as was at first supposed:- " On Friday last, as his Lordship was about riding out, he mounted one of his splendid stud of hunters, a Wicklow, mare, in the courtyard at Curraghmore, and the animal after plunging a little, contrived to throw the marquis, 'who quickly remounited. . His Lordsh p spurred the animal, and endeavoured to get her out of the paved yard, but she backed a short distance, and then gave a kind of a rear, and, plunging, threw her noble rider forward on her neck. The Marquis's foot became entangled in some way in the reins, and he slipped to the ground. The mare walked over him as he lay, bat, fortunately, his Lordship escaped mith a cut in his forehead, wbich was inflicted by the animal's hoof coming into contact with his head. The noble marquis was quickly removed to Curraghmore, where medical aid was quickly in requisition. His Lordship, it was soon found, had sustained but a lacerated wound on the forehead, and had escaped fracture of the skull; and we are happy to state that the noble marquis had so far reYered from the effects of the injury he received as to be able to leave his room on Sunday evening last. Since then his Lordship has been progressing very favourably." TilE GREAT SOUTHERN AND WESTERN FRAIDS. The irquiry as to the property, real and personal, of James Montgomery Knighting, at the time of his conviction, was resuimed yesterday from the previous day. The convict was present during the proceedings, as on the previous day, in custody of two of the turnkeys of the prison in wlhich he is confined. Several witnesses were examined by the Crown to show what property Afr. Knighting was possessed of wlheii committed. It appeared by their evidence that he was the owner of a considerable amount of land in the counties of Meath and Longford, and house property in the city of Dublin, producing a rental of several hundreds of pounds per annum, together with other property, consisting of bonds, bills, promissory notes, &c., to the value of fronm ,0(001. to 8,0001. The case has closed at both sides, and the jury will assemble on Saturday to consider their verdict. Mr. Fitzgibbon, Q.C., who appeared on the part of the Grea' Southern Railway, in his address to the jury, contended that all the property of Ksnigfhting was forfeited, and, as a convicted felon, he had no such right in law as was alleged by his counsel. The learned gentleman further observed,- "Te jury, he was sure, would rot be influenced in their finditg aus to what property the prisoner was possessed of by tbe production of a number of deeds of assignment executed wvhile in jail. They were plainly and palpably fraudulent, intended to defeat justice. All such assigninents were void if not made fo: valuable consideration, and where was the proof of consideration there ? In one case 3001. was the consideration, but no money was paid -a bill, which was ' adviscdly' in circulation, was given. He could not too strongly deprecate the tone in whieh this convict had been spoken of. The juiry were told he was an Iunfortunate gentleman.' Was that the way to designate a man who betrayed his trust, and robbed those by whom his family and himiself were supported, tle sharebolders wvhose money hiad created one of the grandest works in the country '? The jury coald not tell how many thousands this ' unfortunate gentlemanl' had spoliated those shareholders of, and yet they were asked not to ' strip him,' but to protect him, and leave him his real property to enjov when he had earned it by his im,prisonment. He might as well have presented a pistol to tl-e head of a man on the highway, robl-ed him of his monoy, and with it bought real estate, and then, whlen he was brou, ht to justico, his coamsel might as well, as in this case. say, ' Oh, do not touch the real estate of this unfortunate gentleman- pi tect it for himself and his family.' Was that the prirciple on which juries were to act, or was suc:, a thing to be tolerated in any countrye" CONFLICr WITH THE POLICE. The Kiq,' l's Cn,tnd Cltruiicle of yesterday has the following statenment:- * On the 2Gth inst. (S'. Stephen's day), a party of men from Raban, amounting to, it is said, about 200, came to the Blue Ball as murminers, or ' Wrenboys.' After practising some of their absurdities, they entered the publichouse of Mrs. Webb, and partook of some whisky, and so soon as it began to take effect, the recollections of some faction quarrels among themselves revived and were renewed, and they commenced quarrelling, whereupon they were turned out of the house into the yard, and here, in a short time, a furious fight commenced between the mummers, who were now divided into two parties. A police barrack, in which there are five men stationed, is nearly opposite Mrs. Webb's house. Four of the police, unarmed, seeing the affray, entered the yard and endeavoured to put an end to the fight, arresting some of the most violent ; both parties, however, joined in resisting this interference, and attacked the police, some of whom they struck, and they rescued the prisoners with considerable Niolence, reminding the police of Killoughy (which is near, and where, as our readers may remember, several policemen were killed in a conflict with the country people). The police hastened to the barracks, and, having procured their arms, turned out, under the command of Acting Constable Cennell. The infuriated mnob, having pursued them, made an effort to surround them and sepa- rate them from the barracks, whereupon the .acting constable gave orders to load. The mob becomning aware of the determnination of the police to fire if they did not desist, retired, still, however, shouting and yelling defisnce. They were ptursued by the acting constable and his party who suicceeded in arresting and bringing to the barracks as Drisoners 13 of the party, who were next day taken before the muiagistrates at Tullamore, by whoni they were committed tor trial at the ensuing quarter sessions," THE FUNIDS.

Horsfall, one of the members for the borough, has announced to his friends that at the cloce of the present Parliament he will decline being re-elected. The state of his health is the alleged cause of this step.

The Simoom steam troopship, Commander Cooke, was taken down Portsmouth harbour yesterday to sailing moorings off Gosport. It is reported she will soon embark troops for foreign service. The Transit steam troopship was taken into dock yesterday at Portsmouth for repairs. She, too, is believed as likely to convey troops to the East. The Industry steam storeship, Master- Commander Petley, left Portsmouth yesterday afternoon for the eastward. The Resolute steam troopship was undocked yesterday at Portsmouth after refit. It is believed she will speedily be required to convey troops on foreign service. Captain Milne, one of the Lords of the Admiralty, and Lieutenant-Colonel Greene, director of engineering and architectural works to the Board, arrived at the George Hotel, Portsmouth, on Wednesday night, and yesterday morning proceeded to Gosport to witness the working of the patent hauling-up slip and railways for the berthing of the gun and mortar boat flotilla, &c. Her Mfajesty's ship Antelope, ordered to be ready for sea on the 30th ult., has had her sailing instructions counter. manded by direction of Commodore Shepherd, superintendent of Woolwich dockyard, with the sanction of the Lords of the Admiralty, by reason of the repairs and internal arrangements being stil incomplete. She is ordered to be fitted with Clifford's apparatus for lowering the ship's boats.

The regular mails for Maunxtins will accordigly be made up and despatebed from London in future on the 20th and 20th of each month; but, in order that advantage may be taken of any intermediate opportunity that uay offer of communicating with Mauritius vitl Aden, supplementary mails will also be made up for conveyance as far as Aden by the packets leaving Southampton on the 4th of the month, and by the route of Marseilles on the 10th of the month. A POLIIE JUDGE.-Governor Ford, of Illinois, tells an anecdote of one of the early judges of that State, but the governor does not put upon record the name of the considerate magistrate. At the court over which this judge presided -a man named Green was convicted of murder, and the iudge wvas obliged to pass sentence of death upon the culprt. Calling on the prisoner to rise, the judge said to him:-" Mr. Green, the jury say you are guilty of murder, and the law says you are to be hung. I want you and all your friends down on lndian Creek to know that it is not I that condemns you; it is the jury and the law. M(r. Green, at what time, Sir, would you like to be hung! The law allowev you ftme for preparation." The priseoer replied, " May it pleasa your honour, I am ready at any time; those wlho klill -the body have no power to kill the soul. My preparation is made, and yon can fix the time to 6uit yourself; it is all the same to me, Sir." " Mr. Green," returned the judge, "it is a very serious matter to be hung. It can't happen to a man but once in his life, unless the rope should break before his neck is broke, and yon had better take all the time you can get. Mr. Clerk, since it makes no dLinerence to Air. Green when he is hung, juGSt look into the arh.anac and see whether this day four weeks comes on Sunc,%y." The clerk looked as he was directed, and reported that that day four weeks caino on Thursday. " Then," 8a d the judge, "Mr. Green, if you please. you will be hua g this day four weeks, at 12 o'clock." The Attornej-- General, Mr. James Turney, here interposed, and said, M1 A[ay it please the Court, on occasions of this sort it is usual for Courts to pronounce a forinal sentence, to remind the prisoner of his perilous condition, to reprove him for his guilt, and to warn him against the judgment in the world to come." Oh, Mr. Turner," said the judge, " Mr. Green understands it. Mr. Green, don't youe" "Certainly," said the prisoner. " Mr. Sheriff, adjourn the Court." Four weeks from that day Mr Green was hung but not so much to his own satisfaction as his appearance promised on the day of his COnYiction-Amceican paper,
LORD PALMERSTOY AND THE SOUTHAMPTON B;2ZTION. SOUTHAMPTON, JA?. 1. Seldom has an election contest been so pregnant with events of an exciting and irritating character as that in which this town is at the present momeut involved. Every day some new incident arises to foment the angry feeling which prevails, and even the Premier of Eneland has been drawn into the vortex. His Lordship, in a moment of friendly forgetfulness, expresses an opinion upon the merits of the two Liberal candidates ; this opinion is immediately made use of as public property in the interest of one of those gentlemen; his rival writes to the noble Premier on the matter, and receives a reply from him; which letter the candidate, in turn, requests permission from his Lordship to publish, together with the other portions of the correspondence. At this stage the whole question now rests, Lord Palmerston not having as yet replied to the last letter. We have been waiting, day by dwy, in the hope that the correspondence would be completed, before touching this piquant httle piece of election gossip; but, as it would appear that his Lordship is taking time to consider we now proceed to a narration of the facts of the case, as far as they are at present before the public. About 10 days since one of the Premier's tradesmen, Mr. WiUliam Lankester, a partner in an extensive ironmongery firm in Soutbampton, was sent for to Broadlands to see his Lordship on business matters, and this arranged, his Lordship referred to the pending election, and asked how matters stood. Mr. Lankester replied to the effect that they were in a great bastle; that they had ibought Mr Waguelin would have united the Liberals in his favour when Mr. James had left the feld, but that Mr. Andrews had split the Liberal party by the course he had pursued in coming forward as a candidate three weeks afterwards. On this (according to Mr. Lankester's narrative, from which these facts are gathered) Lord Palmer- ton remarked, "Very impolitic; he is not fit for it," and said that though 3r. A%ndrew's was a good felo w enough he was uneeducated. Mr. Lankester then informs his Lordship that Mr. Weguelin had come down to Southampton with the highest introductions, and his Lordship is reported to have replied-" Oh, he is quite the right man; he has position, influence, education, and a high character; he is quite a fit and proper man for such a town as Southampton, and the other is not fit." Mr. Lankester expressed his fears that the result of Mr. Andrews coming forward would be the return of the Conservative candidate, and that M£r. Wilcox would then reign his seat, ending in Southampton being represented by twvo Tories; and his Lordship observed-,' Very sad; he (Mr. Andrews) is not fit." The interview ends, and the curtain faDs on the first act of the drama. On the foUowing evening (Tuesday) we are introduced to act the second. A public meetinc of Mr. Weguetin's friends had been convened at the I ictoria Rooms, atid forthwith Mr. Lankester, who is the chairman of Mr. Weguelin's committee, unfolds a document and reads from it his notes of the above conversation. As may be imagined, such a revelation produced no little consternation and surprise, and great was the storm it evoked. As soon as Mr. Andrews heard of the matter he wrote a letter to Lord Palmerston, enclosing a copy from the reporter's notes of Mr. Lankester's statement, and requesting to be informed whether the conversation had been correctly stated. Three gentlemen of his committee went over to Broadlands on Wednesday with their letter, but the Premier had gone to London, and so an interview with the noble lord was frustrated. The deputation returned to Southampton, and the third act was over. Christmas-day and boxing-day pass away, and on the Saturday morning Mr. Andrews receives a letter by post from Lord Palmerston, wherein he compliments Mr. Audrews on the high position he has attained in the muninipality, which he views as his proper and legitimate sphere of duty, and admits having nsed the expressions attnibted to him. His Lordship, however, deprecates the idea of intending to interfere in the election in any way, and says that he has written to Mr. Lankester, who had committed "- a gross violation of confidence" in making public that vbhich was merely a private conversation. After consulting with his friends, Mr. Andrews again wrote to his Lordship on Monday, requesting permiWon to publish the correspondence. To this letter no reply has yet been received from his Lordship. The fourth act concluded, people are now awaiting with interest the risin' of the curtain for the ",grand dcnfeicemnt"-as playgoers have it-which will, it is hoped, introduce the letters of his Lordship upon the scene, everybody being anxious to read for himself the Premier's opinion. This nice little episode in election matters has, as might naturaly be expected, created great interes4 in all quarters, and has had the effect of increasing the fury of the raging flames.
CREDIBILrTY OF WITNESSES, TO TIHE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-On the trial of Dedea Redanies for murder, reported in The Tines of the 20th of December last, I find the following circumstance occurred:- " Thomas Girling was caUed into the witness-box, and he said that, before he was sworn, he wished to state that he considered the administration of an oath was merely a civil ceremony. " 31r. Baron Bramwell asked him whether he believed in a future state of rewards and punishments. *Girling said he did not believe in a future state, "Mr. Baron Bramwell said that he could not be sworn, and ordered him to leave the witness-box." As this person was called on behalf of the prosecution, and the prisoner was found guilty without his testimony, it may be presumed that in this case the rule which led to his rejection had no important effect ; but suppose he had been the sole witness to a fact which could establish the innocence of a man on trial for his life under circumstances of great suspicion ! Surely it is time that this matter should be se' to rights. There is nothing new to be said about it in the way of argument; the only obstacle to the establishment of a rational practice is the general unwillingness to disturb the existing state of things in coenexion with a question on which a great deal of prejudice exists. Nobody pretends seriously to believe that a sceptic is incapable of telling the truth, or is :n any appreciable degree less likely to teU the truth than another man. We all know the contrary, and make no Foch distinctions in our daily dealings with our neighbours. Besides, wbat can be more irrational than to deny credibility to a witness because he himself makes a statement which is credited, and the making of which, moreover, is a very strong proof of his regard for truth ? He might have kept his scruples to himself, and taken the oath decorously like anybody else; but because he is too honest to do this he is declared so utterly incapable of tr.uth that it is useless even to listen to him. Observe, too, what an easy escape this rule gives to an unwilling witness; he has only to declare that he does not believe in a future state, and the law cannot touch bini. Great advances have been made of late years towards the establishment of the true principle as to the admission of evidence-namely, that all witnesses ought to be listened to, and that it is for those who hear theni to weigh the value of their testimony; and I hope it wiU not be long before good sense has another triumph in the abrogation of the present religious test. I do not say that there may not bo cases in which a jury may properly disregard the evidence of a professed sceptic; all I say is, that it is preposterous to refuse altogether to receive it, when a man may confess himself to be a poisoner, a swindler, a burglar, and yet be admxissible as a witneSs. In connexion with this subject I may also refer to the extremely foolish way in which custom requires judges and magistrates to satisfy themselves of the capacity of children who are brought to give evidence. They are to examine whether the witness II understands the nature of an oath)" If the child can repeat the Lord's Prayer, and can say that "- nanghty boys who tell lies wil go to hell" (which I humbly hope is very far from true as a universal proposi tion), he is a competeLt witness; if not, he is rejected. Nothing can be more fallacious than such a test. Like the rule against sceptics, it is based on the entirely false assumption that there is no moral sense independentldy of religion. The credibility of children should be ascertamned precisely as that of adults is ascertained-namnely, by observation of their demeanour and the amount of inteligence and consisteney which they display, aided, if necessary, by the testimony of others. I do not want to see judicial oaths abolished, because I know that, in point offact, they do secure veracity in many witnesses; still no divine or moralist can allege that an oath adds anything to the obligation to tell thetruth, which is absolute without it; and if a witness either objects t ) be sworn, or says that he considers it superfluous, his testimony should just be taken al the same without any further ado.

Maunder, the Mayor of Barustaple (Devonshire), in compliance with a numernusly signed requisition from the inhabitants of that town, washeld on Tuesday to consider the propriety of Petitioning Parliament against the income-tam. Colonel Buck-, M.P. for the borongh, and many of the leading inhabitants, were present. Resolutions condemning the tax as nnjnbt and inquisitorial were unaninously passed, and these were embodied in a petition to Parliament. A. meeting of the inhabirAnts o' East.

EXECUTION OF DEDEA REDANIE& rMAIDSTONE, SAs. 1. The murderer Dedea Redxnies was executsd this morn ing, at 12 o'clock, in front of tho county gaol at Maidstone. It will he unnecessary to state more in detail the circumstances connocted with the crime for which the wretchod man suffered than to remind our readers that at the late winter assiss he pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him vith the wilful murder of a girl named Caroline Back, 19 years old, and that he was convicted upon a second indictment of the wilful murder of Maria Back, the sister of Caroline, and two years younger. The career of the prisoner appears to have been a somewhat extraordinary one. He was born at Belgrade, in Servia, and until within the last 18 months he had professed the Mahometan religion. He appears not to have been brought up to any trade or profession, but it seems that he served for some time in the Tarkish army, when, being disgusted with that service, he left it, and was for some time at MiLan. Here ho became acquainted with a Catholic priest, who had some conversations with him upon the sub. Ject of his religious notions, and it appears that ho succeeded in impressing him with an idea that the Mahometan religion was not the one likely to lead to salvation, and he became a Christian, and since that period ho has professed the Roman Catholic religion. Upon the breaking out of the war with Russia and the embodying of a foreign legion he joined one of the Swiss regiments that were embodied for the service of this country, and was doing duty with his regiment at Shornecliffe, in the neighbourhood of Dover, at the time he committed the dreadful act for which his life was forfeited. Redanies appears never for a moment to have denied his guilt. Indeed, the only thing that seems to have given him trouble is the complexity of the mode of procedure in the EnglLsh criminal law, whereby he was called upon to return an answer upon four forms of procedare-namely, biUs of indictment and inquisitions by the coroner-whether he waas guilty or not of the offences alleged against him; and he has repeatedly said that his intention was to plead guilty to having killed both the girls, but that as he was perfectly bewildered by having so many charges of murder made against him he did not know what course to take, and allowed everything to proccd without troubling himself in the matter, as he was quite prepared for what he knew must be the inevitablo result-namely, the loss of his own Life. Ever since his conviction the prisoner evinced the most perfect composure and, indeed, impassibility. The Rev. Mr. King, the chaplain of the gaol, of course saw him in the performance of his ordinary duty, but as the prisoner profemsed to entertain Roman Catholic notions he was unwillng to press his ministration upon him; and, a communication having been made by the gaol authorities to the Catholic dignitry of the Brompton district, a priest who had some kno ledge of the German language, named Lawrence, was sent to visit the prisoner, and he was almost constantly in attendance on him down to the last moment of his existence; and was so satisfied with the condition of his mind that he administered the sacrament to him on Wednesday. Notwithstanding this, however, there can be no doubt that there was a very strong Mahometan notion prevailing in the prisoner's mind to the very latest period of his existence- for almost immediately before he was severed from the world he regarded his approaching death with the most perfect indifference, and exclaimed, " In a few moments I shall be in the arms of my dear Caroline; 1 care not for death." The prisoner was allowed some few indulgences that were perhaps not strictly in accordance with prison rules, and among them he was permitted to smoke. He evidently enjoyed his pipe; and on Wednesday he was engaged in smoking as usual, Having finished his pipe lie coolly shook out the ashes, and then laid the pipe on the table, and said, " I smoke no more." After this he amused himself, as he had on previous occasions frequently done, by making a sort of rough sketch of the place aiid the mode in which the double murders were committed; and when he had finished he laid the pen by the side of the pipe, and said, '*Now I write no more; I prepare myself to go meet my dear Caroline." He then went to bed, but it appears that for the first time since his conviction he did not sleep soandly. WVhat doubts and fears disturbed him none can tell; but it was remarked that upon this last dreadful night he was unable to take that rest which he had before enjoyed. He had also previously eaten heartily, bu' on the morning of his execution he was unable to take any refreshment, although lie still exhibited the same outward appearance of composure that characterized him all through the proceedings. It seems that Father Lawrence, the Reman Catholic clergyman wbo was in attendance upon the prisoner, very shortly after he had been in communication with him entertaineda strong belief that he was not in a sane state of mind, and had some communication witk Mr. Bone, the governor of the gaol, upon the subject, and after expressing the opinion that the prisoner was not in an accountable state of mind Mr. Bone, referring to the peculiar circumstances of the prisoner being a foreigner and the daiffi culty of communicating with him, advised that no time should be lost in coinmunicatinm with the Secretary of State, and informing him of the circumstances upon which such an impression was founded, Mr. Lawrence accordingly addressed a communication to Sir G. Grey. It would appear, however, that no sufficient grounds were sated for any interference by the Executive, and the law was, therefore, left to take its course, a communication to that effect having been sent to Father Lawrence from the office of the Secretary ofStatek It was rather a peculiar circumstance that the governor of the gaol rigidlv insisted upon carrying out oneo£ the gaol rules for the exelusion of all strangers from the prison on the morning of an execution. All parties appeared to be perfectly ignorant of the law in reference to the matter, and under which ever- proceeding connected with the execution of the capital punishment devolves upon the High Sberiff, and, in his absence, upon his deputy, At present it appears the unider-sheriff for the county, Mr. W. Palmer, is absent from the countrv on account of iU health, and his duties devolve upon lr. AWildes, the clerk of the peace, and that gentleman deferred to the judgment of the governor of the prison, and consequeDtly, so far as the intenor arrangements of the execution were concerned, the -whole affair was managed with the most complete secresy, no one being present but the governor, the Rev. Mr. King, Father Lawrence, and a few sheriffs? officers, In the case of the poor wretch who was the sufferer upon the present occasion, as his guilt was clear, and as the execution was really, so to speak, a mere matter of course, no complaint should perhaps be made of this course of proceeding, hut it is obvious that if public executions are to be a port on of the la%- of the country it is advisable that some authori7ed representatives of the press should be present on such occasions. In reference to what is above stated as to the want of knowledge of the lav upon this subject, it is only necessary to state that the governor of a prison has nothing whatever to do with the carrying out of tho sentence of death on the morning of an execution. Tl e sheriff is the only responsible party, and aU the governor of a prison has to do is to deliver up the body of the prisoner to the sheriff that execution may be performed upon him, and the governor need not even be present; in fact lie has nothing to do with the matter. Father Lawrence was witli him at an early hour, and they conversed together for a considerable time in German. Redanies did not to the last appear to consider that he had committed any crime; his idea seemed to be that being fondly attached to Caroline Bock, and fearing she was about to become connected with another man, he resolved to destroy her to prevent such a result, knowing that the consequence would be the loss of his own life, but at the same time believing that lie should at once rejoin his beloved one in the other world. That, in fact, death to him vas the prelude to everlasting bliss, and with such ideas evidently fully impressed upon his mind he went to the scaffold as to a marriage bed lHaving been accustomed for some considerable tiune to a military life he had DaturaUy imbibed a good deal of the neatness and smartness of a soldier, and durinF his imprisonment it was observed that he was always particularly careful in his personal appearance. On the morning when he was to leave this world for ever it appears that he took more care than usual in dressing himself. The actual formalities of the execution were very simple. When Redanies saw Caleraft he at once placed himself in a military upright form, and submitted to the new process of pimoning without a murmur, The signal being given for moving to the scaffold the prisoner at once walked off with a light cheerful step, and, although he had some considerable distance to traverse, and a number of steps to ascend before he reached the gallows, which was erected in front of one of the wings of the gaol, and to which access was obtained through a window or opening in the stone work, he did not exhibit the slightest trepidation. His calmness and composure did not forsake him for an instant. The Rev. Mr. King read the Burial Service in English, and Father Lawrence aLso read some prayers in the German language, and after a very brief interval the drop feU ^and the culprit appeared to be dead almost inAstantaneously. It should he stated, perhaps, to show the condition of themin of the prisoner, that when he arrived at the entrance of the gaol and was about to ascend tle stairs leading to the scaffold, he recognized the officer xt the gato by whom lie had at first been received, and, addressing him in the most friendly manner, he stepped on one side and shook hands with him, aLnd exclaimed "Goodbye." and then joined the procension, and tripped up the stairs leading to the -allows. A ceonsiderab'ie number of persons assembled to witness the execution, and their behaviour was most orderly and decorous. A sad event concluded the melancholy proccedings of the day. The body, after hanging the usual time-one hour was cut down, and the workmen proceeded to remove the scaffold. WVhile so engaged one of them fell from a considerable height upon his head, and was killed on the spot.
THE LlrvEROOL FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY.- LTVERPOOL, Jan. L-At a meeting of the Liverpool towncouncil this morning a letter was read from Mr. W. Brown, one of the members for the southern aivision of the county, and an inhabitant of the town, making the munificent offer to build at his own sole expense the now free library-the corporation finding a suitablo site. The erection of the building, it is thought, will cost about 30,0001. Mr. Brown suggests, as the only stipulation, that his name shall in some way be associated with the building, and that he and succeeding members of his family should have some voice in the management of the institution. A vote of thank-s to Mr. Brown wasa unanimouoly adopto coupled with an intimation that the council would be glad to meet his wishes with respect to associating his name with the building and the manageme;t of the institution, and a special committee was appointed to consider the best means of connecting a memorial of M-. I rown with the buildcing whether by a portrait or statu a- nlah, or by any other means,

THE HUDSO'S S BAY TERRITORY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,--My attention has been called to some rather hardr words in a letter inserted in 7rc Times of Mndr v l b my friend Mr. Isbister. It is impossible that le d', should dispute as to facts relating to thc so-called Hudson's Bay territory, nor are we likely to differ much in opinion; and had it been a question only concerning himself and ma I should have been content simply to rejoice that his letter had given many a more extended and more accurate knowledge of a part of British North America of which few Englishmen knew anything, and of which I am as anxious as he is that aU shonld at the present time have accurata knowledge. Butthe convictquestionis no matter forprivate, personal, or party disputes, or one on which any man ouht; to be silent who has anything to say; it is a public question intimately affecting every man, woman, and child inz England, and I therefore trouble you with a few remarks which will, I hope, set me right both with him and with the public. That the country about Lake Winnipeg, the Red River, and the southern branch of the Saskatchewan, is aU that he says, and possibly even more, I do not doubt; that almost, unlimited supplies of corn, if not of cattle, might be raised there is to me, as to him, a well-known fact ; but I presume he could not place convicts there among some 10,000 free British citizens, where the boundary between the u nited States and British territory is not two miles, breadth of w-ater, but an imaginary line representing the 49th, parallel of north latitude. We knowv that the country between Lake Winnipeg and Hudson's Bay is not of the same character as that tor the south and west, and wlhetber bread, corn, and cattle can be raised there in any quantity or with any certainty remains to be proved, and I srhaU be the first to rejoice when Mr. Isbister has proved it, either bythoapplication of convict or other labour; but if you or your readers wil refer tomyletter inyourcolumns on Christmas day, it wifUbe seen. tbat I wrote only of the country round Hudson's Bay, and I freely express my disbelief that the necessaries of life can. be produced there. I do not, for reasons familiar to him, consider the country to the south or west of Lake Winxii -eg Hudson's Bay territory. That Vancouver's Island is the worst possible place for . convictestablishment may admit of a doubt, his positive as. sertions to the contrary notwithstanding, and lIer Majesty's Government and the public will form their own opinions orn the subject. I wish, however, that he had not been quite so hasty in his consideration, for there are, as he well kno sw parts of that island from which escape would be almost, If not quite as difficult as fro,m the shores of Hudson's Bay, and I may add that the nearest point to the Americars boundary at which I slhould recommend a convict establishment being forned on Vancouver's Island, would be 22 miles distant by sea. The cost of transit to Vancouver's Island might possibly be three tinies what it would be to Hudson's Bay, but I arsi much mistaken if the cost of such a settlement on Hudson's Bay would not be more than three times the cost of one on Vancouver's Island, for, if we consider! only the cost of protection from weather and food, in the latter wooden barracks, built by the convicts themselves, would be fully sufficient, while in the former, in the absence of wood of any size and in any quantity, r prresume recourse must be had to stone; and I think event Isbister would not expect crops from the soil roundt Hudson's Bay under some two or three years' tillage, while on the prairie land on Vancouver's Island they might be reaped the first year. In any part of the Hudson's Bay territory, even if we extend that appeUation to the southern. boundary of British America, cattle require housing during seven months of the year, if during that time they are to be of any use, and food for that time must in any case be stored' up for them; while on Vancouver's Island they live out and find sustenance for themselves, as well in winter as ixx summer. If further comparison is necessary I shaU be happy to afford it, but my principal object was and is to draw attention to the importance of a naval station where our vessels may refit and find coal and stores in the north-east Pacific,. to avoid the necessity of going to San Francisco and Val.. para so and paying largely for what we might in our own territory obtain for little, and to convict labour, as tha cheapest means by which the necessary works might be per" formed. I am, Sir, your obodient servant. IL G. NICOLAY, F..G.S. VAN. L.
THE QUEE3Z's ENGLISH, TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-"Tbe one " and " tho other" have attracted so, much attention that I would fain hope that " such" might; not pass disregarded. There is some risk of its taking root as a Parliamentary vulgarism. In the letter in your impression of to-day, from the offlc of Works to the Engineers to 'whom the metropolitam drainage question is referred, there is an extract from an act; of Parliament which illustrates the proper and the vulgar use of "such." "The Metropolitan Board of Works shall make suck sewers," ac., "as they think necessary," &c., "and such. BoardI shall,"I icc " Such tewers as they think neccssary,"-equivalent to "sewers of the kind which they think necessary`--is right. but "such BoaTd"' irtended as an equivalent for "thu Board," is altogether indefensible. I believe that it was first used as a substitute ft% the legar vulgarism "said"-a word of which lawyers make prodigious use in documents which are to be paid for by length, but not in &heir private correspondence or in their conversation. VWy should not " the" or " that" or " those," instead oE sLch" or "- the said" or "the same" or - the aforesaid,'" be used in acts of I'arliament and legal documents as well as in the mcst accurate scientific composition 7 It may occasionally bappen that " the said" is convenient: for identification, but I gavely suspect that it 72 " saids" did not make a folio tho word would speedily go out of use. The Irish lawyers use "said" by itself, instead of "the saod,e thui avoidjtg the use of two words by re,&cting tho one which ouzglt to be retained; and Mr. T. Steere, thet United States' Consul, according to your report of his speech at the dinner given to Lord Panmure, followed their example by talking of "the exports-to said provinces." Home Too'ke long ago denounced bhe legal vulgarismsp "be the said" and "they the said," and they are given up by all but slavish adherents to old forms. Would it not be as weUl for the chairman of the committees of tho House of Lords and the Speak-er of the House oL Commonsto instst that "such" shall never be used improperly in any act ef Parliament, and that the use oE " said" shllU be wholly dropped ? Is it loyal, ic it decent, to ask Her Most Gracious Majesty toeg oher Royal assnt to bad English ? Yours obedientlv. - X.JL. Jan. 1.
