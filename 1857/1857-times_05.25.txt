BUSKIN UPON MILZAIS. The following is an exeract from a recently publisbed work by Mr. Ruskld upon the present Exhibition of the Royal Academy - "283. A. Dream of the Past. (. E. Millais, A.) The high praise which I felt it my duty to give to this painter's work iast year was warranted by my observing in it, for the first time, the entirely inventive arrangement of colour and masses, which can be achieved only by the highest inteUect. I mrst repeat briefly hero what I have had occasion hundreds oX times to explain elsewhere, but never yet often enough to get it generaRy understood-that painters are broadly divisible into three classes: first, the large class who are more or less affected or false in all their work, and whose productions, however dexterous, are of no value whatever; secondly, the literally true painters, vho copy with various feeling, but unanimously honest purpose, the actualities of Nature, but can ouly paint them as they see them, without selection or arrangement - whose works are therefore of a moderate but sterling value, varying according to the interest of tha subject - lastly, the inventive painters, who are not only true in all they do, but compose and relieve the truths they paint, so as to give to each the utmost poasible value; which last class is in all ages a very small one; and it is a matter to congratulate a nation upon when an artist rises in the midst of it who gives any promise of belonging to this great imaginative Coup of masters. Andthis promise waa veryvisible in the wor o Millaislastyear; anew power of conception being proved in them-to instance two things among many-by the arrangement of the myrtlebranches m the IPeace,' and the play of the colours in the heap of ' Autumn Leaves.' There was a slovenliness and imperfection in many portions, however, which I did not speak of, because I thought it accidental,-consequent, probably, on too exulting a trial of his new powers, and likely to dis. appear as he became accustomed to them. But, as it is pos. amble to stoop to victory, it is also possible to climb to defeat; and I see with consternation that it was not the Parnassian rock which Mr. Millais was ascending, but the Tarpeian. The change in his manner, from theyears of 'Ophelia' and ' Marana' to 1857, is not merely Fall-it is Catastrophe; not merely a loss of power, but a reversal of principle: his excellence has been effaced, ' as a man wipeth a dish-wiping it, and turning it upside down.' There may still be iu hixa power of repentance, but I cannot tell; for those who have never known the right way, its narrow wicket-gate stands always on the latch; but for him who, having known it, has wandered thus msolently, the byways to the prison-house are short, and the voicea of recal are few. I have not patience much to examine into the meaning of the picture under consideration. If it has one, it should not have been disguised by the legend associated with it, which, by the way does not exist in the romance from; which it professes to ie quoted, and is now pretty generally understood to be only a clever mystification by one of the artist' friends, written chiefly with the view of guarding the awkward horse against criticism. I am not sure whether the bitterest enemies of prm-Raphaelitism have yet acocused it of expecting tocover its errors by describingthemin badEnglish Putting the legend, however, out of the question, the fancy of the picture is pretty, and might have been sublime, but that it is too il painted to be dwelt upon. The primal error in pictorial grammar of painting figures in twilight as bright as yellow and vermilion can make them, while the towers and hills, far above and far more exposed to light, are yet dark and blue, could hardly have been redeemed by any subsequent harmonies of tone, much less by random brilliancy; and the mistake of painting the water brighter than the sky which it reflects, though constant among inferior painters in subordinate parts of their work, is a singularly disgraceful one for a painter of standing. These, and the other errors or shortcomings in the work, too visible to need proving, and too many to bear numbering, are all the less excusable because the thought of the picture was a noble one, and might seem both justly to claim, and tenderly to encourage, the utmost skMllandpatienc-einitsrendering. It does not matterwhether we take it as a fact or as a type-whether we look verily upon an old knight riding home in the summer twilight, with the dust of his weary day's journey on his golden armour, taking the woodman's children across the river with him, holding the girl so tenderly that she does not so much as feel the grasp of the gauntlets, but holds the horse's mane as well, lest she should fall; or whether we receive it as a type of noble human life, tried in al war, and aged in all counsel and wisdom, finding its crowning work at last to be bearing the children of poverty in its arms, and that the best use of its panoply of battle is to be clasped by the feeble fingers, wearied with gathering the sheddings of tbe autumnal woods. It milght bear a deeper meaning even than this-it might be an image less of life than of the great Christian Angel of Deatb, who gives the eternal nobleness to small and great, and clasps the mean aud the mighty with his golden armour; Death, bearing the two children with him across the calm river, whither they know not one questionug the strange blue eyes which she sees fixed on heaven, the other only resting from his labour and feeling no more his burden. All this and much mome than this-for the picture might be otherwise suggestive to us in a thousand ways-it would have brought home at once to the heart of every spectator had the idea but been realised with any steadiness of purpose or veracity of detail. As it stands, it can only be considered as a rough sketch of a great subject, injudiciously exposed to general criticism, and needing both modification in its arrangement and devoted labour in its future realization. I am sorrowfully doubtful, however, how far Mtr. Milais may be capable of such labour. There are two signs consDicuous in this year's work, of augurystrangely sinister; the first, an irregularityin the conception of facts, quite unprecedented in any work that I know in the Realistic schools of any age; the second, a wared feeling in the selection of facts, peculiar, as far as I know, to Millais from his earliest youth. I say first an irregularity of conception. Thus it seems only to have struck the painter suddenly, as he was finishing the knight's armour, that it ought to be more or less refective; and he gives only one reflection in it-of the crimson cloth of the saddle, that one reflection being violently exag. gerated; for though, from a golden surface, it would have en, as he has rendered, warmer than the crimson, no refection is ever brighter than the thing reflected. But al the rest of the armour is wholly untouched by the colour of the children's dresses, or of their glowing faces, or of the river or sky. And if Mr. Millais meant it to be old armour, rough with wear, it ought to have been deadened and darkened in colour, hacked with edges of weapons, stained with stains of death; if he meant it merely to be dusty, the dust shonld have lain white on some of the ridges, been clearly absent from others, and should have been dark where it vas wet by the splashing of the horse. The npple of the water against the horse itself, however, being unnoticed, it is little wonder if the dash of the chance spray is missed. A more manifest sign still of this irregular appliance of mind is in the fact that the peacock's plume, the bundle of wood, and the stripes of the saddle-cloth are painted with care; while the children's faces, though right in expression, are rudely sketched, with unrounded edges, half rose colour and half in dirty brown. Vestiges of his old power of colouring, still unattainable by any other man, exist, however, in that saddle-cloth and in the peacock's feather. But the second sign, the warping of feeling, is a still more threatening one. The conception of his second pict 7re (408) is an example of the darkest error in judgment-the f3talist failure in the instinct of the painter's mind. At once coarse and ghastly in fancy, exaggerated and obscure in action, the work seems to have been wrought with the resolute purpose of confirming all that the bitterest adversaries of the school have delighted to allege against it; and whatever friendship has murmured, or enmity proclaimed, of its wilful preference of ugliness to beauty, is now sealed into everlasting acceptance. It is not merely in manifest thimgs, like the selection of such a model as this for the type of the foot of a Spanish lady. or the monstrous protrusion of the lover's lp in his intense appeal for silence; but the dwelling perpetually upon the harshest lines of form, and most painful conditions of expression, both in human feature and in natural objects, which long ago, when they appeared in Millais' picture of the "Carpenter's Shop," restrained the advance of pra-Raphatlitism; and would arrest its advance now, uniess there were other painters to support its cause, who will disengage it from unnaturalness of error and vindicate it from confusion of contempt. For Mr. Mhllais there is no hope, but in a return to quiet perfectness of work. I cannot bring myself to believe that powers were given to him only to. be wasted, which are so great, even in their aberration, that no pictures in the Academy are so interesting as these, or can e for a moment compared with them for occasional exceUence or marvellousness of execuxtion. Yet it seems to be within the purpose of Providence sometimes to bestow great powers only that we may be humiliated by their failure or appaUed by their annmihilation; and sometimes to strengthen the hills with iron, only that they may attract the thunderbolt. A time is probably ed in every man's career, when his own choice determines the relation of his career, when his own choice determines the relation of his entdowments with his destiny; and the time has come when this painter must choose, and choose finally, whether the eminence he cannot abdicate is to make him conspicuouts in honour or in ruin."D

FrcMCH SUIPPr ' TO A SToCK SHOW.-ASOM--J what characteristic mode of testing the merits of the various prize animals at the recent fat stock show at Poissy, near Paris, was adopted by the jurors of that exhibition. After the animals had been slaughtered as required by the regala. tions under which the exhibition took place, and the weight; had been ascertained, the jury were entertained at a dinner in which portions of the various prize animals were served up; the "object being to test which breeds give the besim quality of meat." The flesh of the first prize animals was selected to undergo the ordeal. Aportionof each animal wa cooked separately; the time taken to make ready, the weight before and after cooking, &c., were gone into with consider. able minuteness." The writer in the North BErit* Agricul* tu,ist, from whom we take the particulars of this novel agricultural competition, says,-" Those who have not paic much attention to this subject, esteeming meat simply as fat or lean, would be astonished at the difference in the tasta of the soups, and of the meat from which they were pro. pared, were they to make the experiment. They would& tind that the 9lesh of certain breeds is better adapted than. that of others for boiling-others for roasting." Oa each dish the jurors came to a division, which was oftem. very close, seven to seven, the votes being taken by a show of hands. Bachjuror tooknotes bythe numabers-she number being the only distinguishing mark. The votes were putafter each div&sion of soups or meat was partaken of. Fusts came the trial of soups, ol which eight specimens were pre. pared from the fiesh of oxen, English and French. The soup made from the Duke of Beaufort's prize shorthorn oK was considered by a majority to have made the best soup. So the best boiled meat, thatfrom which the soup had been. made, was considered to be that of the same ox. Nlext was the trial of roast pork. And the first quality was found to be that from a cross of the new leicester pig with a French breed caUed t Augeron. Then came roast mutton, of which eight sorts invited the trial of gastronomic discrimination. The Cotswold was placed first, though the competition was very close, the first division being equal, one juror on a second. division giving his adhesionto the Cotswold roast. We. think this quite rght, for though in this country it is the fashion to hike the darker-fleshed mutton, an unprejudiced taste must, we think, prefer the Cotswold, which produces much more lean meat than the Leicesterto all other breeds We should notice that the reporter, obviously a Scotehmau; demurs to the mutton decision. Last of all was the trial of roast beef, of which there were no lea. than 13 specimens, " all very good, requiring on the part. of the jurors more thau ordinary balancing of points ci merit." Nor was the difficulty of the final trial lessened bf the circumstance of "the appetite being somewhat paUed by the food previously partaken of." Indeed, g,ivi all credit to the small portion only from each dish of which it; is the French custom to partake, we can scaroely underst. ad how the jurors could have undergone the labour of devour. ig even a mouthful from each specimen. And yet we leara that between each trial course there intervened some non. competing course, snch as fish, fowls, sweetbreads. asparagUs, and so forth. The roast beef bad ben cooked *' before a small grate containing charcoal, with a bhchelor'es oven behind;"aud the colour of several of the roasts "wasuot good." Some, however, "w ould have gratified the taste ot the most fastidious epicure." The following are the, results :-The West Highland ox of the Dake of Beaufortwvas first; the Devon ox of the Earl of Leicester, second,; tae Charolaise, third; the cross ox of Mr. Datdgeon, shorthorna Angus, fourth; Mr. M'Combie's ox, Angus, aged, class. fifth; the Limousine, sixthi the Duke of Beaufort's shora. horn ox, seventh; Parthenas, eighth. The others were notclassed. Probably the testing powers of the jurors had by thistimebeenoverpowered. Itissaid, "afterTotingonthe. roasts, which was attended with considerable excitement, each jaror appeared to acquire increased confidence in his~ judgment and taste as the testing proceeded." The dinner concluded with fruits and pastry.-Rconomist MUXDER I STAFFORDsuE ..On Saturday. morning, at 2 o'clock, Mr. T. Charlesworth, farmer, oC Bromley Hurst, near Abbotts Bromley, was brmtaly mrardered and robbed on his return home from a place where he. had beenenjoyingthe evening. We learn that immediatelr after the intelligence became known three persons were apgrehended by the county constabulary and taken before Mi.. grm, magistrate, in the course of the day, and rema,ded to the leak-up at Uttoxeter, until Wednesday next. Their names ar= Browne, Jackson, and a fIlow known as "Dal. cimo Jack." Browne made a full confession to Inspec. tor Crisp, which was taken down, signed by the prisoner, and shortly after handed to Colonel Ho chief constable of tho county.

The failure has been announced from Liverpool, 7<cf Mr. John Doherty, in the American provision 'and corn trade. The liabilities are believed to arnount to about 100,0001., and it is feared the assets are small. The railway meetings of the week have presented few features of interest. The report of the Water. ford and Rilkenny Company states that competition has interfered with traffic receipts, but that arrangemutnts have now been concluded by which the terms are raised to their original standard. The directors do not recommend a removal of the chief offices frcm England to Ireland. According to the report of the Antwerp and Rotterdam Company the pasaenger and goods traffic exhibits an increase, but in the cattle traffic there is a decrease. The receipts i?rom minerals will be augmented through the route to MIoerdyke, and the completion of the line from I'lushing to Venlo will extend the communication on the one hand towards Flushing, and on the other to Tilbourg, Bois-le-Duc, and the German railways. At a special meeting of the Ulster Railway the Echeme forthe disposal of the forfeited shares was apXroved, and the directors have been authorized to talie the necessary measures for carrying the propozition into full effect. The report of the Trust and Loan Company of tpper Canada, issued preparatory to their meeting on the 30th, states the net profits for the half-year ending the 31st of March at 9,37]1. A divide.Dd at the rate of 7t per cent., less income-tax, is recommended. Half of the surplus profits over six per cent. are to be appropriated as usual to the reserve fund, 2501. is to be applied to preliminary expenses, ond 3111. will be carried to the credit of the next half-year. According to the report of the Mercantile Bank of India, London, and China, submitted at Bombay on the 24th of March, the net profit for the six months ending the 31st of December amounted to 31,4941. A dividend was declared at the rate of -eight per cent. per annum, and the balance, 11,4971., vwas carried to the reserved fund, which now amounts to 40,2191. 1'he followina relates to the new Government in eansure for the constitution and control of savings- "Lincoln's-inn, May 21. *Sir,-The SaviDngs-Bank Bill now before Parliament is decidedly the most iuportant measure of the kind emanat. ing from Government since the establishment of these institutions; and, as I claim to have been the first, with Mr. 'W. M1. Christy, to advocate its principle, I beg to offer a §ew remarks, with a view of briefly stating the nature and practical effect of tho measure, respecting whioh some mis. apprehension appears to have arisen. "I The new Bill proposes to empower the Commissioners of the National Debt to establish savings-banks, giving to the idepcsitors Government security; also to enable them to make regslations for tho general management of the banks, and to appoint inspectors to enforce these regulations and inspect the accounts. II That a reform in the principle of these institutions was nee'.ed is obvions. While other similar institutions have ibeen rapidly progressiDg, indicating the increasig thrift and resources of the industrious classes, these have declined, demonstrating that, as now constituted. they 'had ceased to | 8atibfy the exigency of the times. The cause of this lies -on the surfaco. Governnment savings-banks offer alwaysbad, security, low rates of interest, with sometimes irregular! management and prodigal expenditure. Under the nevw Act there mnust always be good security, and thore may be higher rates of irterest, with greater economy of management and incrensed facilities for depositing. "1 The advantage to the depositor of Government security -was always apparent, but, constituted as the banks were, Government rightly declined to incur the responsibility. "' The problem was to reduce this liability to a minimum. The difficulty was more apparent than real, and arose solely in rot regarding the question from a commercial point of view. Indeed, the proposition only required to be clearly stattd to suggest its own answer. It was obviously in violation of sound commercial principles to require the Government to stake the public credit to seoure tbe repayment of money over the receipt and custody of which it exercised Do efficient control. If, therefore, this deficiency were supplied by furnishing Government with adequate means of inspecting tho accounts, controlling the expenditure, and regulating the management of these institutions, the risk inocurred would be really inappreoiable. This is now propose d to be effected by the maohinery of inspectors and auditors, who will bo the servants of Government, and liable to it only for the discharge of their duties. Herein lies the real merit and essence of the now measure. I am satisfied the plan will work efficiently, and is open to no practical objection. "There is nothing in the Bill indicating that the Government wish to interfere with the healthy independent action (of these institutions. The power of appointing the other paid officers is vested in the trustees and managers. To grant the above powers to the commissioners is only in compensation of the liability assumed by the Government. No more is thereby conceded to Government than would be to commercial partners having the right to inspect the accounts and regulate a business the pecuniary obligations of which they were liable to discharge. Another rovel feature of the measure is the provision that it will enable depositors to have invested in their names in the public funds any sum exceeding 1001.; a boon to the poorer classes, putting within their reach the cheap and easy means of making such investments. If the Provisions -of this Bill be fairly tried; i. e. if the ' regulations? be judi- i {ciouely framed by the commissioners, and discreetly but 9 stijetly enforced by the inspectors the Government cannot sustain any appreciable loss; and fpredict we shall witness a striking instarce of how powerfully different courses of legislation may operate to mar or promote the prosperity of such institutions.1 "The clause in the Bill restricting the use of the title 'savings-bank' to banks sanctioDed by the commissioners; appears to be arbitrary and unnecessary. *In conclusion, I would suggest that the Bill should not be passed in its present form as a separate Act, but that the; previous Savings-Bank Acts should be repealed, rearranged, anld re-enacted, incorporating the provisions of this Bill * thei effect would he to simp'if a branch of our jurisprudence ibecoming needlessly complicated and confused.

"Sir,-There are two letters in your columns of this morning which, if left unexplained, are calculated to injure me unjustly. " In the first place your reporter has described me as a stock and sbare broker, whereas I am described on the files of the Court as a dealer in mining and other shares and public securities. In that capacity I acted. " What my counsel, I believe, really did say was, not that it was the custom of ' brokers,' but 'that it was the custom of dealers in the Stock-Exchange to Bell both stock and shares which they had not got.' " If Mr. Lucas employed the word ' broker' instead of 'dealer, ' it must have acisen from the fact that neither I or amy solicitor had any previous consultation with him, nor could he have had any proper instructions, as it was quite without my knowledge, and not until after the opposing counsel had made his statement, that Mr. Lucas was inBtructed to defend me. "The letter emanating from the Committee of the StockEsxchange, announCing that I am not a member of their house, is gratuitous, because it is well known that I am a member of the Mtining Exchange, where every person acts as both dealer and agent.

STATB OF TBADE. MANCEESTER, MAY 23. There was nothing like animation in the market, and the purchase of only 28,000 bales of cotton at Liverpool for consumption is a true indication of the depression which characterizes all branches of trade in this district. Constautly a small business is springing up in orders for assortment fronm various quarters, but there is no bold and healthy pulse in any department, because the prices at which goods are produced induce distrust, and buyers are anxious to confine their liabilities within the smallest compass possible until it is seen what is the probable future course of prices. Manufacturers and spinners are in the meantime, anxious to keep down the produce of the loom and spindle as much as possible; and, in addition to those at Burnley, a number at Stockport, Bacup, Rocbdale, and other places, are about to work only 40 hours per week. BIRMINGHAM,L MAY 23. The iron trade of South Staffordshire continues steady at last quotations. There seems to be no inclination, either one way or the other, to disturb present prices. The demands from the British North American colonies are improving. Most of the large works are, however, full of orders, and are not anxious to enter upon fresh contracts even at exist. ing rates. Mine pigs continue firm at last quotations, and the consumption increases rather than diminishes. The easier state of the metal-market operates favourably, although not to any great extent, upon the staple manufac. tures of Birmingham. Some of the brassfoundry trades exhibit symptoms of improvement, but the brass and copper wire and tube manufactures are still dull and in. active. Cabinet brassfoundry is generally pretty brisk, and the smaller makers of domestic wares for the factors, who pay promptly for the material they obtain and use " from hand to mouth," are considerably benefitted by the late reduction in the price of copper. The Birmingham manufacturers now in London represent the braziery business of the metropolis as upon the increase. Orders are comrara* tively good, and, if the prices of metal as at present deciared were satisfactorily established, the demands of the entire country trade, it is thought, would be unusually great. The manufacturers of tin goods are busy, as are all de. scriptions of the hollow ware businesses. The consumption of these articles has recently kept the chief establishment3 of the town and neighbourhood urgently occupied, as well for home as for foreign requirements. I ittle new can be said of the general trades and manufactures of Birmingham. As usual, the state of many fluctuates with the season, when the article manufactured is more or less required by consumers. Although not unusually busy, many, if not most of them, are, however, doing a more than average amount of work, and few are positively or extremely depressed. For japannery there have lately been good orders, and for ornamental productions and jewelry there is a better demand than has occurred during the year. The glass manufacture is unquestionably dull, and this is attributed greatly to the continued high price of materials, The journeymen cabinetmakers in Birmingham are seeking fcr an advance of 2s. per week in their wages, but at present the demand is made respectfully, and there are no positive indications of a strike. The foundries of the surrounding manufacturing districts are, according to reports, pretty fairly employed, the engine and boiler making businesses being somewhat active. The cut nail manufacture is busy, and at Willenhall the lockmakers are moderately well engaged. For the general hardware manufactures of the town and neighbourhood it is said that extensive foreign orders have been given out during the week. A great portion of these have Deen for the South American trade. LEICESTER, MAY 23. The home demand for plain hosiery goods is flat, and there is not much doing for the United States. The sock and fancy branches are rather muore active, and there is also a little doing in the cotton branch, The wool-market iS tolerably firm. Tbe worsted mills are working short hours. The hosiery trade at Loughborough, Hinckley, and in the country districts continues dull. NORWICH, MAY 23. The manufacturing trade here continues quiet, but with the execution of the autumn orders a revival may be shortly expected. The condition of the shoe trade is stil favourabe. The operatives of the city are, generaUy speaking, LEEDS, MAY 23. There is no striking change in the condition of the staple trade of this district; but perhaps, on the whole, a little more firmness has been manifested during the last few days, A rather better feeling has been exhibited in the warehouses, and several buyers have bean down from London and the provinces, but their purchases have uot been on a large scale. hMediums, sound black cloths, and a few faney goods seem to be most in demand, but the trade in mantle cloths is almost over for the present, and the inquiry for winter goods has notyetset in. At the cloth-halls this morning transactions were to a moderate extent, a pretty gencral feelig which now prevails that there will be no mmediate further reduction in the price of the raw material having given a slight impulse to trade. HALIFAX, WAY 23. There is a little improvement to report in the state of trade. More inquiry has existed both for wool and yarns, but purchases are made with caution. The price of wool is maintained. Several orders for yarns have had to be declined, in consequence of the prices offered being such as to entail a loss on the manufacturer. Rather muore has been doing in pieces, especially in light fabrics for home use. On the whole, the aspect of things is decidedly more favounrable than it has been for many weeks, DUJBLIN, MAY 23. The customs' receipts for the week to Thursday, the 21st of May, inclusive, were 20,4171., against 18,7441. last week. BELFAST, MAY 22. Lmen.-The Armagh market was sparingly supplied, but the demand being slack there was no change in prices. In Lurgan the quantity of lawns offered was particularly small ; prices are ndvancing.

Linen Yarn.-The demand for yarn for home consumption is slow, but as a considerable number of shipping orders are still unexecuted stocks are low and prices firn. Mlam-The markets were poorly supplied with flax, in some places not more than a couple of loads or so appear. ing. lt is generally consideredthat 10-12ths at least of the crop of last season have been disposed of, and that not more than one-sixth remains to supply the wants of the spinnaruntil the new crop comes in.

BAIrWAY IMT LIGENX. LLANELLY. An extraordinary meeting of this company washeld on, Saturday at the Lo,ndon Tavern, Mr. Biddulph in the chir. The uHAiRMAff explained that at a meeting of the com. pany, held in October. 1853, the directorg were authorized to issue the whole of the preference shares, and certain shares in lieu of unissued ordinary shares, 'Which were caled substituted shares. The Act of Parliament authorized a preference dividend not exceeding 6 per oent per annum. On the 16th of May, 1855, it was agreed, at a meeting of the proprietore, to issue the remainder of the nOw 251. shares at 41. discouant, and that they should be entitled to a preference dividend of 6 per cent. per annum. Shares to the nominal amonnt of 50,0001. were )sTsed, and they now proposed to issue the unissued or sub. sttitted shares, amornting to 14,0001., at 6 per cent. per annum for three years, andS percont. per annum thereafter, but not to allow any discount; tho shares were tobe paid in fallt as they wvanted all tho money. Thei6 per cent., or 1 per cont, extra, would be given in lieu of discount. They would be oflered ini the first instnce to the shareholders, and if not aU taken up the remainder would be offerod to tli_public. mr.Glascodine, tho secretary, read a report, which Stated that on the 16th of October, 1853, the proprietors resolvod to raiso additional capitalto the amount of 64,000C. on 5 per cent. preference shares, which were also to be entitled to participate in any dividend beyond 5 per cent. on the old shares. The sum of 50,0001. had been raised on tho3e shares, and there remainod 560 substitatod shares, representing 14,000C., to be issued in order to enable the directors to complete certain works, and provide additional working stock, according to former estimates. In reply to questions from Mr. ALLEN, Mr. IILrar, and Mr. SHAW, it was stated that only 425 of the preference shares were isued at 41. discount, so that a net sum of 48,1731, was obtained by the issuo of 50,000L preference shares, The substituted shares proposed to be issued would make uP the 61,0001. authorized to be raised on preference shares. The Llandilo extension would be completed within 1,0001. of the estimate. The trade on the railway had increased from 12,0001. a few years ago to 20,0001. last year; they would have additional traffic from various sources when facilties for conveying it were provided. On the motion of Mr. HElkLm, seconded by Mr. Ssr.&v, a resolution was passed authorizing the directors to issue the 560 substituted shares, to be entitled to 6 per cent_ per amn-am up to June, 1860, and 5 per cent. per annum afterwards. The oalls might be paid in advance, and 6 per cent. interest would be allowed. A vote of thanlks to the chairman concluded the proceedings. TIL.BURY, MALDON, AND COLCHESTER. This project is virtually abandoned, although the arrangements negotiated between Mr. Brassey, on the part of Sir Morton Peto, and the directors of the Eastern Counties Company are not definitively concluded. The East-Saffollk line, when completed, is to be worked by the Eastern Counties Company, the number of trains is to be adequate to the wvants of the district, and the directors of the respectve companies are to make the necessary arrangements. Th eSshareholders are to receive the 6 per cent, guaranteed by Sir Morton Pete.nu-ntoe RHYMNEY. The works of this lino are progressing so satisfactorily that it iS expected it will be opened as far as besowmswr in a few weeks. A considerable length of tho permanent way has been laid in the direction of the Tat Vale Junaction. At lfaesycwznwr the line will form a junction with the loop line within a few miles oE the Crnmlin Viaduct. The district abounds in ,inerals, and neow coUieries are being opened in proximity to the railway. The opening of thfs ralpwhaywill also give easy access to the colebrated site LIMERICK AND ENNIS. The report of the directors of this company congratulates the shareholders on the improved prospects of the company. The works have made considerable ?rogress since they came into the hands of Mr. Dargan. The land requirad for the line may be considered as in the possession of the company, and, with a trifling exception, has been aU paid for. Contracts have been enterod into on advantageous terms for the supply of rails and sleepers, and the directors were assured that there would be no difficulty in opening the line for traffio before the end of the present year. Tho call of 54 per share made in January last has been generally well answered. A nrumber of shares in the hands of parties whom it would be useless to press are in courso of forfeiture, and the forfeiture would he submitted to the proprietors for confirmation on the 30th inst. Application had been renewed for a Government loan, which the directors had every reason to expect would be successful. The report of Mr. J. B. Pratt, the engineer, stated that tho works on the line were commenoed by Mr. Dargan on the 22d of November, 1856, and considerable progress had been made in such works as could be execated m the winter months. From Febraaryto Maythe workswere machretarded by the severityoftheweatherand the difficalty onfprocuring horses. Notwithstanding these disadvantages the works have been continued over the whole line, and smceo the 1st of May the number of men and horses has been increased to more than 600. The plan for the swivel bridge over the Pews has been approved by the Admiralty and the Board of works, and is now in the hands of the contractor. The rails, fish-plates, and wood screws have been contracted forby an eminent firm for 1,1191 per mile, delivered. The contract for Baltic sleepers has been taken by Messrs. Martin, of Dablin, for 2931. per mile delivered, making the oost of the permanent way per mile 1,4124, a sum less by 25OZ. per mile than the average of railways in Ireland. Theoline is 24tmiles long, and 21 miles of it have been fenoed in. The earthworks of 14 miles have been brought to formation level. Six months will be required to complete the worls on the remaining 10 miles, to lay the rails, and to open it for traffic. Mr. Dargan will guarantee the opening of the ine in six months if the company are prepared to make the necessary money advances. I3fPROVEHENT OF PERMANENT WAY. It appoars that Mr. J. ML Pareons, C.E., has succeeded In accomplishing a matter much wanttel in the permanent way of rallways, that of securing the ends of the rails firnly in their position, and tbus preserving an even road. at the joints of the rails. This is performed by means of his " wedge fish-joint chair," which is twico the length of the ordinary chair,and so contrivedonone sideasto catch the lower flange of the rail, and press close under the upper flange. The otherside of tho chairis fitted clwthtwo flatblocks of wood, cut so as to present the end of the grain to the side of the chair, and extending about two inches in thickness to,vards the rail, between which and the bloclks of wood is driven a long iron wedge, which presses the web of tho rail jest under tho top flange and rests edgewise on the bottom flange. The effect of driving the wedgo is to tighten both ends of the rails which meet in the chair, and at the same time to press down the bottom flange ofEthe rails solidly upon the chair, thus preventing any upward, down. ward, or lateral motion between the chair and the rails. One side of the iron wedee is barbed, so asto hold its position on the wooden blocks, which are creosoted to preserve them. The chairs at the intermediate points of bearing are formed in a similar way, but are only half the length, and they also secure the rail to the side and bottom of the chair as described. The shrinkage of the wood endwise being imperceptible, it is found that after the wedge has been tightened the second time it remains firm and solid in itsposition for manymonths requiringno attentionwhatever. The ordinary wooden wedges require constant attention and do not hold the rail firmly in the chair for any length of time, as the various chan es in the weather affect them considerably. The state of the rails near the joints secured by Mr. Parsons's method forms a striking contrast to those fastened in the ordinary way. Specimens of each may be seen in operation on the Great Northern Railway, near Holloway, and on the London and South-Western Railway, about half-a-mile down tbe line from Vauxhall. It will be seen that the surface of the rails is as smooth and flat at tho points of junction as In the middle of the rail, snowing that they are completely secured to the chair. The bearing surface in Mr. Parsons's chairs being at least double that of the ordinary chairs, the injury to the bottom flange is reduced one-half, and by the superior mode of securing the rails the " hammering" is prevented. It is stated that the expense of removing the ordinary chairs and replacing them by the "wedge fish-joint chair" will be comparatively small, being less than that of the cost of fishing, and capable of being more readily executed. The wedge-fish joint chair has been in use on a portion of the Great Northern line since December, 1854, and, having stood the test of the heavy traffic, its use is to be further extended on that line. It is also being entirely adopted on the East Kent Railway, 20 miles of which will be opened for traffic in September next. TRAMFIC RETURINS. Eailway. Mie Fe&-lier.

IRBLAND. JUDGE CBAMPTON ON TE SOCIAL ;VL. DUBLIN, SATURDAY Mowmts- lMr. Justice Crampton, who has been for a nua. ber of years an ardent disciple of the ultra-te-A perance school, took occasion yesterday in his charge to the term grand juries to. deliver; a lengthened homily on the spread of the old national vice, a fact which the learned jud.ge could only account for by the facilities afforded for the granting and renewal of spirit'licenses. Ex- ressng his total disbelief that Parliament would owmgly sanction the commoa use of any article vhich was injurious ito health, morals, or religion. he proceeded to say "Christianity, gentlemena,ls stil part of the law of the land, and 'the British Parliament is stilla Christian Pgliament. Now, I own, my poor opinion is, that both the Principles to which I have adverted are violated by the liwr which permits, nay, encourages, the common use of spiritn ous liquors, under the notion that thereby a valusble revneae is created for the Sitate. t3y opinioniafoundedupon these two considerations-frst, that te national expenditure necessarily incurred to raise the revenue is so great that upon a balance of accounts it will be found nearly to countervail; if not entirely to annihilate, the expected revenue; and secondly, that thoephysical,fmoral, and religion evils aceomp. nying and flowingfromtthissystemnimmesurabl, oxoeodany pecuniary advantage to be derived from the spirit duties. jrL would take up more of tho pablic time and tax your patience more than would become me were I now tolenter upon a detailed statishcal view of this wide subject. in nstsaimnt of the positions I have taken the libert to ly down. Bat I woulN ask uo, in considering tho economical queation,to compare with the net reve-nue returned by this tax the milions of barrels of wholetvme bread corn-the staff of life itself-which must necessarily be consumd, destroyed, in order to procure the unholy revenue derived from the spirit duties. Add to this the expendisore of human labour. or machinery, of collection, of law costs, and of police, and estimate then how much or rather how little of the spirit revenue will remain for the use of the Stae. I caunot now enter upon the black catalogue of the physical and'moral mischiefs rem1ing from the spirit trade as licensed by Parliament; these are obvious and open to every eye that is not wilfully closed against seeing them. What I would now desire to impress uon your minds is the alarming increase of the number of lcensed publichouses; the frightful conse. quences arising from the multiplication of these-I 'iiil cali; them poison shops-are matter of daily experience. I may say of them in the well known words of a great statesman, ' They have increased, they are increasin,, and they ought to be diminished.' Their number 99 'Legion' and their office is pretty much the same -as that of those who call themselves by that name. On this occasion I shall advert to one only of the many mischiefs growing out of the multiplication of publichouses in this country-I mean its result in the multipL;4ation of crime and its baneful consequencer. I need not tell you, gentlemhn, that the number of publichouses In Dublin, and in every town and district in Ireland, far exceeds the number of bakers' and victuallers' ahops. It has been computed upon the best authority that upon an average throughout the uruted kingdom there is not less than one placo at which intoxicating liquors are sold for every 20 families. A startling position this is. I need not say, therefore, that throughoit our own countryfar greater fcilities are afforded for tho salo of a poisonous indulgence than for the supply of wholesome food to our poor and excitable population. I need not tell you that go 'here you will throughout thii country-north or south, east or west-wherever you see a chapel, or a place of public worship, adjacent thereto youwill be sure to find one or more publichousee' I have been led to make this last remark by a sad experienoe. in the course of my long circult duties, that a greater number of crimes of violence and blood are in this country committed on the Lord's day than on any other day of the wee;k, and that the publiehouse is generally {he scene or the cause of the crime. The reason is obvious. The publichouEe is most frequented on Sunday-Sunday is, in fact, the publican's harvest day. I can appeal to my ovrn notebook of assize trils for many years in testimony of this painful fact. I go not now beyond the last assizs and a single county. I shall not weary you with details. It was my lot to preside in the county court at the last assizes of thecounty of Cork. Now, mnostof you remember, Iam sure, that Cork was the firstandchief scene of the meritorious and successful labours of the late benevolent Father afathew.. A terrible reaction, I am sorry to say, has taken place there, and drunkenness prevails in that county to an alarming degree. And when I say that county, let me not exoe t other counties in Ireland. I look to my note of trials at Ere ltb Cork assizes, and what do I Snd as bearing upon this particular subjecb 7 I take five cases, almost immediately succeeding each other in the pages of my manuscript book. Of these, four were cases involving charges of murder and homicide, and the fifth was a case of dangerous asault. Some of themminvolved severalprisoners in the trial. There wereconvictions in all, andofcourse punishment awarded in all; but what I want to remark iE, that aU these cnines were committed on a Sunday, and that they all grew out of drinking in a publichouea on that day. I may say in additioni that the parties convicted were not persons of bad character, but were reported to be generaUy of sober and industrious habits and respectable in their line of life. I pas by other cases of violence tried at the same assizes and growdng out of publichouse doings, because these latter offences were not Sunday crimes. But including all offences of every kind, I can from many years' experionce state, with perfect assurance of its trath, the positionrthat two-thirds at least of the crimes with which we have to deal as judges are directly or indirectly traceable to spirit drinking and the publichouse. But some one may say, 'Would you have the spirib license to be totally withdrawn, and let each man brew and distil in his ownhouse and at his own discretion ?' I answer, first, suppose it were so, the nation would not be in a worse state than it is at present. I think that by such a measure neither drunkeunwsnor crime would be increased, and, at all events, Parliamentwould nolonger, in that respect, be the abettor of crime and vice. But, secondly, such is not my meaning. I would say, legislate not in a mere financial spirit, looking only to revenue, bat in a spirit of benignity, and with a view to the comfort, morals, and improvement of the people, If distillation mauststiU be allowed (as I fear it must), tax all distilleries, both monster distilleries and petty distilleries, to the utmost of your wil. If spirits are sll to bemade and sold, make stringent laws that no intoxicating drinks shall be drunk on the premises3where they are sold; save only by travellers and gaests in inns or eatinghouses. Abolish your public. houses, abolish your beershops, which are only provocations to spirit drinking; and thus, not entering into details, whic are delicate and difficult, a law, I -think, might be framed which, without trenching upon the revenue of the Crown, would largely contribute to the happiness, the morals, and the iuprovement of our people. We are told that a sturdy Roman concluded his every speech in the RomanSenate by these remarkable words, 'Detnda esI Cartine,' and so, gentlemen, would I now conclude by saying to you and the British Parliament-Pnblehouse are nuisances, and they should be suppressed." EE asmoLm V . g ar THE CATHOLIC UNIVERS=r. For several days past reports have been current to the effect that there is a screw loose in the machinery of the Catholic Uuiversity, and that unless prompt aid be administered the notable scheme devised by Dr. Cullen for closing the gates of the Godless Colleges will only be remembered as among the things that were. No one will deny that thus far the project has disappointed the expectations of its promoters, and the rumour now is that the learned rector himself (Dr. Newman), having no tawte for sinecures, is about to be transferred to England, -where some rnore suitable appointment has been provided for him. It has been remarked that for a long time there have been no monthly meetings of the committee, nor any public acknowledgment of the receipt of fresh contributions for the sustainment of the institution, so that wvithout money or any increase of pupils, and being as unlikely as ever to obtain a charter, it could cause no surprise if the Catholic University should meet the fate which its own friends say is imminent. The concession made last year by l'rinity College, by wrhich four non-foundation scholarships are thrown open to the competition of Roman Catholics and Dissenters, although trifling and coming somewhat late, has nevertheless materially damaged the Catholic University; and had the march of toleration commenced earlier in the Dublin University, it is much more than likely that a Catholic rival, even thougi chartered and recognized by thp Government, woid have been a stiUl more signal failure than thepresent exhibition of a college with a fuU staff of professors 'lecturing to aU hut empty benches. In fact, aJl officers and no soldiers might be the just complaint of Archbishop Cullen. As a matter of business the ultrammontaneorgansmaybeindue course instructed to deny the truth of the current reports; but it must be borne in mind that their origin is traceable to influential Roman Catholics t and whether well- informedt or otherwise, is a point which may be settled between the parties themselves.

It appears tUt the prisoner had gros6ly misconducted himself sine he bed been 0dged at Dartmoor prison, and had xnadeltlr attempts to escape. A few days ago he made an attenpt to ecapo by running awat from the seperabt ells wben let out to wash him;slf, and 9e also took a leadin part in an act of insubordination in which eight ether eonvtots went concernd.

LONDON, MONDAY, MAY 25, 1857. It surely cannot be admitted that a country like England is unable to suppress the African Slave Trade. No one can urge that the strength of the good cause falls short as opposed to the evil. The odds re all on the side of humanity. On the side of humanity is the first naval Power in the world, supported by the sanction or acquiescence of every civilized State. Success, too, has not been wanting to encourage further exertions. Philanthropists can point to a long line of triumphs. From the days when Lord MANsrsD, in the case of the Negro SomBrnszT, declared that slavery was impossible within the limits of England, to the present time the struggle has been proceeding, and both slaveowner and slavetrader, though obstinate in their resistanoe, have been forced to yield one position after another. England and France have both abolished slavery within their doinnions, and States which stiU continue to uphold slavery have declared with more or less of sincerity that it shall be limited in extent by a prohibition of the trade which fed it. The contest lies, therefore, between England, backed by the moral feeling of the whole world, and a few desperate adventurers who gain a precarious income by carrying on the traffic between Africa and the Spanish colonies. Cuba is now almost the only country which regularly imports large numbers of Negroes, and to supply the plantations of this island most of the slavers which now pursue their odious trade are fitted out. As the Americanis refuse to admit the right of search, the Slave Trade, it is said, is now almost wholly carried on under their flag. Nay, unless statements publicly and repeatedly made be false, the greater part of the slavecarrying crafts are owned by American citizens, and fitted out at American portpr; so, indeed, it is declared in a resolution adopted by a meeting held at Kingston, Jamaica, in February last. The feelings of the inhabitants were, no doubt, much moved by the condition of the blacks liberated from the slaver which had been captured by the British vessel Arab; and this meeting, which passed strong resolutions on the subject of slavery and the Slave Trade, was the natural result. We have no desire to echo any Protectionist opinions of the Jamaican politicians, yet, as we ought to give the slaveowners, both AngloAmerican and Spanish, their due, it may be said that in the minds of great numbers of them this country by its dependence on tropical productions, and consequently on slave labour, has its share in whatever sin there may be in slavery. If Manchester buys more than half the cotton of the UJnited States, and we receive the sugar of Cuba and the coffee of Brazil, the fact is not without its effect on those who are on the look-out for arguments against us, and are willing enough to turn the discussion from their own inhumanity to our inconsistency in denouncing it. Of these arguments there are nulmbers current in the slaveowning world,-some plausible, some absurd, but all satisfactory to people who want excuses for their own misdeeds. " If you abolished slavery it was with "a view to foment insurrection in the Southern "States; if you guarantee Free-soil institutions to "Ruatan, it is to revolutionize and subject Central "America. You keep a squadron on the coast of "Africa to be ready for action in any part of the "Atlantic, and you demand the right of search to "demonstrate your superiority over other mar"time nations. In fact, you do not wish to "see the Slave Trade abolished; you would rather "it should continue, since it gives you oppor"tunities of interference and aggrandizement." Such is pretty much the reasoning on the matter, and it must be allowed that, as long as we profess a desire to suppress the traffic and hesitate to take the best means for doing so, the accusation of insincerity, though unjust, is likely to find believers. As matters at present stand, we blockade the African coast, which stretches for more than 2,000 miaes along the Atlantic. What chance there is of suppressing the traffic by such means may be well imagined. The squadron consists of vessels heavily armed and manned, and able to crush any slaver that they can come near. But the slavedealers know very well that in open sea they are not likely to be caught. They build their vessels for speed; they have no heavy guns; and they cram their cargo of human flesh into the smallest possible space, knowing by experience that if they can bring into port half the number of negroes they embarked they will make a handsome profit. Our only chance is to surprise them at the mouths of rivers or in unfrequented roadsteads of the coast while they are getting their cargoes on board; even in such cases they will stand out to sea, hoist American colours, and defy us. As for treaties with chiefs aud so-called "K ings" in the Bight of Benin, they are, of course, simply useless. Where Spanish Captains-General and New York citizens make fortunes by the trade, how can it be expected that King Tom or King JuMBo should refran ? It seems, therefore, a most ineffective policy to attempt to stop the trade at the point of embarcation. The chief success that has yet been gained has been owing, to the determination of the various American Governments to exercise strict control over their ports, and the vgilance of olur squadrons has thus served to aid these States in their good intentions. Bat as long as the Cuban authorities wink at the lauding of slaves by the thousand, while we are steaming to and fro on the African coast, there is little prospect of improvement. If, then, Englanld wishes to make a great effort to put down the trade in its last stronghold, it will do well to turn its attention to the Cuban coast itself. The Spanish Government is bound by treaty to do its best for the accomplishment of this great object. This assistance might accordingly be demanded, and, in default, a general blockade of the harbours of Cuba established by an English squadron. It is, we firmly believe, in vain to trust to the Spanish Government for the immediate or even the eventual prohibition of the trade; but, under the pressure of the British Minister, it might be induced to give orders for the seizure of whatever Negroes were brought into port, and for the rendering of due assiatance to the efforts of our commanders. The total suppression of the Slave Trade seems not only possible, but easy, if such means were adopted. It is no small thing that, though more than one nation is interested in the continuance of the traffic, none has had the shamelessness to withhold its official condemnation. On these grounds, and with so high a moral position, it is our duty to persevere. Nor arm the interests of our on.-n colonies to be put out of the question. With The extinction of fhe trade in R0iVes tIherc might be a better prospect for a frw- i Sni ri ion. Talk to most people aboiit -h .l ':igroes from Africa to Jamaicus .r Ti 'a' under some system of appv Aceship or contract, and they will probabiy may that it is only a Slave Trade under another name, and that the adoption of such a scheme would destroy all the influence we have acquired, and cary the world back to the worst days of inhumanity and recklessness; but once let the real Slave Trade have ceased for ever, and not only the British colonies, but even those American States which have, to their credit, abolished Slavery altogether, will find it to their advantage to bring over Africans under some wise and humane system, which will benefit the regions on both sides of the Atlantic.
The sfate of our affairs at the Cape, as described on Friday night, is not encouraging. It is Hot but what the colony is a valuable colony -very valuable indeed, with an almost unlimited expansibility, salubrious climate, productive soil, infinite natural advantages, and, in short, all the attributes that could render a supplementary territory desirable and precious. The drop of bitter in this cup of sweets is furnished by a certain incident of the settlement on its eastern frontier. These regions abut upon a body of tribes known as Caffres, with whom the boundary settlers are constantly in close, and often in hostile, contact. Such, it is true, is nothing but a natural condition of colonization, to be found in many other countries of the globe, but the aggravation and difficulty attending the case at the Cape are extremely remarkable. These Caffres are not mere helpless stragglers of some aboriginal race-in fact, Sir DE LACY EvANs was taken to task for calling them " miserable bar" barians." They are a wonderfully superior race of savages, descended, it is said, remotely from Arab stock, and displaying, beyond doubt, a capacity for the least eligiDle developments of civilization which renders them, unluckily, anything but agreeable neighbours. We should probably have outlived by this time any ordinary desciption of annoyances arising from such a source, but the Caffr seem fairly to puzzle u. In their habits theyare nomadic and given to the pursuits of pasturage, but they happen also to be the most incorrigible cattlestealers in the world, and evince a proficiency in thieving which it is impossible to surpass. Of course, depredations of this kind excite the ira of the colonists, who live also by their flocks and herds, and the end of it is a fight, when the embarrasments of our position become very strikingly c' napicuous. These interesting and well-extracted heathens, though not much disposed to any but martial enlightenment, have a most unfortunate aptitude for war. They adopt European weapons and tactics with extraordinary facility, suffer little from a state of hos;ilities, are under no danger of starving, and are uncommonly hard to kill. Relying upon these local and personal advantages, they held us at defiance the other day, as they have often done before, for months together, and only discontinued the contest at last, as Major WonrrTuv told the House, because they had no more gunpowder to go on with. The difficulties arising out of such a neighbourhood are doubled by the circumstances in which the mother country and the colonists find themselves. In old times, when Dutch and not British ideas prevailed in the settlement, the Caffres were treated as barbarians are usually treated by borderers of a higher race. The colonists formed themselves into small extemporized battalions, took the field against the natives, and, being better equipped, better armed, and not troubled with many scruples of warfare, were, perhaps, as formidable to the Caffres as the Caffres were to them. In fact, it was savage work on both sides, with the superiority of power on the side of the settlers. But this system provoked the most resolute denunciations from the philanthropists of Britain. Missionaries, though they could never teach the Caffres the eighth commandment, appealed on their behalf in touching descriptions, and at length the colonists were no longer aUowed to go out and shoot natives on their own account. The defence of the settlement then passed in due course to the regular troops of the empire, and the Caffres were provided with antagodists in a certain number of regiments of the line. 1By this system, however, our disadvantages were enormously increased. The Caffres are on the spot, disposed to war as a natural diversion, invited to it by our presence in districts which they would rather see their own, and fully competent to carry it on with satisfaction to themselves until their ammunition fails, or a year or two of peace may seem agreeable as a change. We, on the other hand, despatch our combatants by a long and costly passage all the way from England to South Africa, maintain them in the field by a heavy expenditure, and, though we may succeed in protecting the colonial frontier, never get the enemy under our hands for a decisive blow. All thishwhile tho Caffres, without divesting themselves of their untutored wildness, acquire our military tactics with marvellous success. They have guns and horses in pretty good condition, are excellent shots, and possess, in fact, as Mjor WonTLEY emphatically observed, the material for " the finest light " infantry in the world." Of course, under such conditions, they like' to keep themselves in exercise. Three years, it was remarked, with ironical pleasantry, were about the time allowed to elapse between one Caifre war and another; and, if we may take each war at 3,000,0001., the result will be about a million annually out of the national exchequer sunk in this very unproductive investment. The worst of it is, too, that the colony has no interest in saving us anything, but rather the contrary, for the Imperial expenditure upon 2,000 or 3,000 toops is of course an enormous advantage to it. Tho only man who seems to have discovered any escape from these straits was one of a family eminent in military aptitudes-the NAprn=s. Sir GBuOnx NIrAUM, when Governor of the Cape, bethought himself that cattle-lifting, after all, was a game which two could play at; and that if the whole dispute turned upon this it might be settled by maintaining a good running account, and keeping on the safe side. Accordingly, having calculated that Caffres stole cattle to the average value of 5,0001. per annum, he retook Line to that amount, and thus restored the balance of commerce as conducted in South Africa, without resort to regular war. At other times we have tried new frontiers, acquisitionS of territory, cessions of territory, neutralizations of territory, treaties, conventions, and a hundred other expedients; but with no substantial or permanent success, and statesmen seem at their wits' end in the case. "It was " no easy matter," Mr. LAoUCMnr assured the House, " to decide what plan should be pursued "for the defence and protection of the Cape., " The House had already had severe experience "of the difficulties in which this country "might be involved with respect to the affairs "of that colony." It seems to be thought that now, at any rate, whatever might have been the case formerly, the colonists cannot fight their own battles, though, as the settlers must have increased, we should think, in numbers as largely as the Caies, and could be at least as well organized and equipped, it is hard to see where the savages should havo gained so much advantage. Major Wopnmy thinks the importation of gunpowder into Cafiraria should be stopped, and troops enough maintained out there to impress awe by their very appearance. The last resource of all has been the establishment of between 2,000 and 3,000 of the German Legion on the frontier, which must, we hope, be of some service, though Mr. ADDnn.enY'S arguments were well qualified to prevent any very sanguine anticipations on the point. Towards the close of the debate, however, COlOnel SiEuS threw out an idea-not now mentioned for the first time-that something might be made out of the Caffies themselves by taking them into British pay, and engaging them for Dur own service, as was done with the wild tribes of India. Certainly it is very hard that these savages, with forms, as we are told, of admirable symmetry, and an intellectual organization evidently capable of better things, should be so provokingly perverse in the line they select for progress. They bid fair to be the best skirmishers and the most irreclaimable thieves in the world; but is it not a thound pities that their proficiencies cannot be made to assume another form? It is possible they might be tempted to ecrol themselves, like the Bheels, into an irregular corps, and be moulded by some strong-minded OuTaAr into a hardy and useful class of soldiers; but, as South Africa contains no enemy but themselves, we hardly see how they could be employed, when the elements of war would have disappeared altogether. Such, however, is the aspect of this troublesome question, and we can only trust that the troops of the Line and the Legion together may at any rate be successful in averting another of those periodical ruptures in which our difficulties are so painfully expressed.
A correspondent in our impression of Friday brought the weight of authority down upon the | inequalities of the Poor Iw, and the sad case of the " East-end " ratepayers, of which we have lately heard so much. He cariTed us back to the fountain head, the Magna Clarta of the English poor, the great Act of the 43d of liEzABaTH itself, which founded the Poor Law system in this country. He showed from that Statute what the intentions of the Iegislature were in establishing Poor-rates-viz., that they should never press with undue severity upon this or that particular parish, but that when the pressure exceeded a certain point the parish should be assisted from without. The Act of Queen ELIZABETH gives power, in case the inhabitants of any parish should not be able " to "levy among themselves sufficient sums of money "for the purposes aforesaid," to two Justices of the Peace " to tax, rate, and assess any other parish "or parishes within the hundred ;" and " if the "said hundred shall not be thought able and fit to "relieve" the hard-pressed district, then " to tax, "levy, and assess any other parishes within the "county." The principle is undoubtedly laid down here that a parish should not be too hardly pressed, but that its burden should at a certain point be spread over a larger area. Unfortunately, we have little more told us here than what we should know without being told. We know, even without going to the authority of the 43d of ELrzABxra, that it is not the design of English law that injustice should be done in this any more than in any other public arrangement,-that a parish should be overburdened any more than that an individual should be. On this principle there is universal agreemnent. The only question is the practical one, how we are to relieve the overburdened parish-i.e., bow this is to be done in consistency with the necessities of the case, which require a parochial area of rating? The 43d of ELIzABFTH thrown no light on this question. In the first place, the Act appears to contemplate a case of greater urgency even than the "East-end" one, a case, viz., in which there is literally not money enough in the parish to feed the poor; and its intention is rather with respect to the poor themselves than the ratepayers, -to save the poor from actual starvation where there is no money to pay the rates rather than simply to lighten the ratepayers' burden. In the next place, the Act only contemplates the case of temporary pressure upon a parish, and only contemplates a temporary remedy-i. e., a temporary fund raised by the taxation of the hundred or county to meet the need of the occasion. But the " East-end" case is a iery different one from this, and would not be met by this mode of treatment; and here the argument of our correspondent rather fails. He very properly appeals to the 43d of ELIzABETH, and to the Report of the Committee of the House of Commons in 1800, founded upon that Act, as proof that overburdened parishes should be relieved. B1ut both that Act and that Report only contemplate temporary relief. The Report, whicb, he tells us, was drawn up by the #*e of the House, including MIr. PITT, then Chanellor I of the Exchequer, recommends "the Tasm, of a "local fund-the levying of a local tax through "the metropolis, for the puroe of easing the three parishes of whose distress complaints have i been made," but it expressly regards thus remedy as caLed for " by the extraordinary pressur of the present time," and says that this measure is to form no precedent which can be pleaded "except in some case of similar emergency, and. "in a like period of dearness of provisiona and consequent distress," and " not to be considered as opening the way to any invasion "of that general principle of the Poor Laws by CC which parishes which have sufficient means of "maintaining their poor are exclusively charged "with their support." The relief, then, which both the Act and the Report contemplate is only temporary relief to meet a temporary pressure upon the ratepayer. But the case of the " Eaxt" end" is that of permanent pressure, and whatever treatment i3 applied to it should be a permanent one. Here is a set of parishes in which, from causes which have beenlong in operation, and i of which we see no probable termination, poverty unduly accumulates. Eowarewetoassitthe6e parishes "without any invasion of the general principle of "the Poor Laws ?" That is the difficulty, and the Report of 1800 does not solve it. It leaves us in the lurch just at the point where we want explanation. Temporary measures are " no inva- ' sion of a principle ;" they do not touch the system of which they are merely interruptions ; but permanent measures affect the system. How are we permanently to relieve overburdened parishes without any invasion of the principle of parochial rating? ? We must fairly confess that the case of perma- nently overburdened and crushed parishes is not I contemnplated by our law, that this new fact must be met somehow or other, and that a thorough examination of the whole question will be necessary in order to meet it. In the meantime, without at all wishing to diminish the claims of these haTdpressed parishes to justice, or give any excuse for the postponement of the consideration of their case, we think we may fairly remind the ratepayers of these districts that there is, after all, though not a complete remedy, yet some relief to such pressure in the natural working of things. There is, to a certain extent, a self-acting justice in these cases of permanent pressure. It appears from the Report of the Committee of the House of Commons from which our correspondent quotes that the Poor-rates of some of our East-end parshes, even in the year 1800, amounted to " between 4s. and 6s." in the pound. That was their rating then, and that is their rating now, and probably for a considerable part of the whole time between it has not been much below this. Now, we cannot believe that household property and rents could permanently keep up under such a pressure as this and be unaffected by it. It stands to reason that they must falL 'When a man buys a house, does he not take the present and probable future average of the Poor-rates into account ? Is not that as regular an element in the calculation as the condition of the house itself, and the timber, bricks, and mortar which compose it ? And is not the same element taken into calculation when a man rents a house ? Such a state of things as this, when it has gone on a certain time, must affect house-rent; and if to that it is replied that the loss only goes from one person to another, and passes over the tenant, to fall upon the landlord, the answer is obvious, that the greater part of the household property in these parishes must have changed owners half a dozen times since the year 1800, and therefore that the greater part of this property must have been bought with this depreciating cause at work upon it. Of course, the first effect of a long Poor-rate pressure is real loss to these owners of the ptoperty; that is certain enough; wherever there is money taken away somebody must pay it. But, as distinguished from the first effect of such a state of things, does not its permanent effect to a considerable extent touch rather the property itself than the owners and occupiers of it? Does not the result settle down ultimately in the fact that houses and shops are depreciated in value in certain quarters of the metropolis,-a fact which no more unfairly touches the purse of the present owner than the first fall of a railway share from 1001. touches the pocket of the subsequent purehaser who bought it at 501. ? We do not offer these considerations as wholly decisive of the question; at the same time they are rather apt to be forgotten by ownera and occupiers, who regard the value and rent of property as fixed by nature, or fate, or chance, and then protest against the burdens as if they were a wholly independent consideration, whereas the burden has in the first instance been an important element in fixing the value, so that if they suffer from it at one end they have benefited by it at the other. In a complicated system such as that under which we live thero is a vast deal of latent balance and adjustment perpetually going on, and the great rule of common sense that a man should only give for a thing what it is worth meets the disadvantage of a depreciated article by a lower price. At the same time no argument in the world will ever persuade a man, or ought to persuade him, that it is all right and fair that he should be paying Is. in the pound Poor-rates while the inhabitant of the other end of the town only pays 7d. While we may fairly hope that there has been some self-acting justice in the case, we must decide these questions by the present facts, and not by the metaphysics of property. Overburdened parishes ought undoubtedly to be relieved. If they are not, there is a danger that they will simply take the law into their own hands and let their poor starve.

AMERICA. (BY zzr Ia AND & XNATIONAL DEZkPff.) LWvE oL, MAr 24. By the Royal mail steamship Aftic$, Captain Shannon, we have advicms from New York to the 13th int. She has brought $1,534,578 specie on 2ight. Among the passengers by the Africa are x J_. G. ulsmaun, Austrian Minister to Washington, and MIr. John Clairborne, who hax b13een appointed special agent for the American Govermnent to collect statistical information in Europe in relation to the consumption of ootton. On the 14th inst. the Africa pawed the Royal mail steamer Asia, hence for New york, and the screw steamhip Queen of the South, bound wet. The Washing Vi Usio, of the 9th, says:- " We larn that the Cabinet have acquired considerable insight into the motives which prompted Lord Palmerston to reject tbe Dalh-Clarendon Treaty. His Lordship pro. feases only to desiro certan verylimited protection to the Indians and to resident British subjects, and the modiicae ton of the treaty to that extent. This position, which has been semi-officially assigned to the London Cabinet, is 14 no means comprehensible by the President and his Cabinet. Indeed, if we consider the assumed attitude of lord Clarendon sinoe the rejection of the treaty it wi be impossible to comprehend what in reality ig the object of Her Majesty's Government in Central America." Adespatch from Vashington of the 12th to the .New York7 Times says :_ " Nothing is to bo done relative to the Dallas-C,e1ndon Treaty. There has been no correspondence between Mr. DAllas and Lord Clarendon, but merely a convereation. Lord Napier has stated the grounds of objection, not only to the Secretary of State, but to others, and in terms of the mOet conciliatory nature. The Senate so altered the article of the treaty, in regard To the Bay Islands as to require the absolute and unconditional ewsion of the islands to Hondura, instead of the qualified cession whie' was propoe. Herein rests the whole obiectiou, I X not think from what I lean tht the Admninistration is dispoeodto go into neow treaty; there is no danger of any collision, the whole matter must zest till thenext Congres meets. The Administration will not instract 3Ir. Dalsto offer new propositions Mr. Dllas, in a letter to General Cass, expreSe the opinion that if the treaty had reached England prior to the electionit would undoubtedlyhae been ratified. The officialpapersjustoommunicatedbyLordNapier contain a formal proDoEition for a neow Centrl American Treaty, but the Administration will probably do nothing inx the premis until the meeting of the next Congress, when the entire subject will be laid before the Senate in deference to their views heretofore expressed." The New York 7Times thinks that if the British Govemnment are right in regarding the Central American Treaty, as amended by Congreas, as a deliberate and dangerous attempt to keep open a Southern gateway for the extenaion of slavery, and as it isprofeeedlyaninterfereneththerightsofGmrt Britaintoformtreatieswithindependent Statesonthe American continent, the adtion of the Britisn Government will be sustained in England, as it ought to be, heartily and at a risks, and to any end. It is flatly impossible for the United States to prevent Grest Britain fromfilling the position in Central Ameriea to which she is fairly entitled as the first commercial nation in theglobe. The New York Courier and Enquirer has the following from its Washington correspondent *- " There was abundant proof in the records of the State Depatment that England hu no jalouy df the United StAte in connerion with Central America, and only de6sired to adopt ia reference to those countries a meaure for the promotion of her commercial interests which the United States could approve. She would have preferred to act independently of this Government but for the uspicions which the ruling party here had iustiled into the public mind that ehe entertained projects of colonization and territorial aggremion. The British Government therefore eagerly accepted Mir. MXrcy's project, which was sent out very soon after Mr. Pierce lost ths nomination for the Presidency; but Mr. Buchaanu ws not consulted, nor was Mr. Jeaffreson Davis, nor Mr. Mson, the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. From the instant of its promulgation the confirmation of the treaty was considered hopeless, all the influence of the retaing Administration was exercisod in vin, and it was only saved from unconditional rejection by a postponement until the advent of the new powers. Then Mr. Buchan aund General Cass held a contercnoe with General Davis, who had been transferred from the War Department to the Senate, and it was agreed between them that the peace of the country required some attempt at conciliation. General Davis introduced the suggested modifica. ,ions, and they were adopted by the Senate by the emat' vote necessary to give them effect, but against the prot4st of the senators representing the Filibustering interest" The Courier and Inquirer, referring to a rumour that Lord Napier, acting under the instractions of Lord Palmerston, had proposed to the President to go into another negotiation. on the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, but that Mr. Buchanan had promptly declined, expresses disbelief in the alleged refusal The Courier regrets the rejeetion of the treaty, inclining to the oDinion that the British construction of the convention of 1850 was the true one. The Washingto,t Union of the 9th announces by authority the following:- ' The Governments of ngland and Franeehave notified to the Government of New Granada that they canot approve its position towards the United States Lord Clareir don hAs written to the British Envoy here, apprising hin of the attituLde of Her MajesWs Cabinet upon this question, and we have reason to know that the contents of Lord Clarendon's despatch have been communiated to the State Department." There had been a desperate, but unucessful, attempt of the convicts to escape from Singsing Prison; one of them was shot. Several unsucoessful attempts had been made in Baltimore to get up meetings to express sympathy for and furnish aid to General Walker and the cause of Filibusterism in Nicaragua. The Burdell murder case was brought to a close on the 9th inst., after being six days on trial. The jury brought in a verdict, having been but 35 minutes out of the court-room, of " Not Guilty." Mrs. Emma August&aCunningham Burdell was discharged from custody; MIr. Eckel was also discharged on his own recognuizances in the sum of $5,000. The trial had done nothing to clear up tho mystery of this strange case. 1 Advices from Havannah to the 2d inst. report cold and wet weather throughout the island. Sugars were high.

4JBNERAL SIR CHARLFS XA .4PIER.* (Continued from The Times of A, ril 10.) It bas been the lot of our great Jndian heroes to 'wina deathless renown, but in theirl ietime to bring mpon themselves inevitable obIo(1uV. So it fared -with Clive, of whose achievements we are all proud, 'but over whose head while he lived the censure of lhe House of Commons hung like a sword ready to fall. So it fared with Warren H astings, whose anemory as the greatest of lm1:3n statesmen -we cherish, while yet from the scene of his glory he returned to England only to hear his -conduct impeached before the Hwoise of Lords in strains of eloquence the most elaborate that had -ever been addressed to that august assembly, and so -successful that for ten long years a favourable ver.diet was withheld by judges unwilling to condemn and yet scarcely able to exoulpate. So it fared with Niapier, who certainly deserved well (if his country -and showed extraordinary ability, but who also by lis own act reaped the censure of his Government, -and made more enemies to himself thau any other mnan of his time. Some of his oppivnents, indeed, endeavoured to fasten upon him the iufaniy of being like the elder Nabobs-murderous, extortionate, -corrupt and false,-at one time iii,b -cile, at another time insane; but these were scirrilities which never -seriously damaged him, and which he ought to have despised. The fatal error which he comm itted was ,this, that being a tyrant by nature tie never freely -submitted to be a servant, and that in his heart bedieving the East India Company to be " agents of 'he Devil to make men miserable," lie accepted the pay and consented to be the agent of these agents, with the determinationi to have his owin way, and 'with muchof the feeling whichled Satanhimself to regard ruling in hell as better than serving in heaven, -and which procoredfor Sir Chatles the title of SheitanJ&a-bhaee, or Devil's great brotiier. Necessarily, therefore, his decrees provoked the criticism of his subordinates, awakened the jealousy of equals, and jostled with the authority of his superiors, while -the private talk of a commander, whose tongue was -even sharper than his sword, and who was eaten up -with admiration of himself and corntempt of other maen, could not fail to be reported, and reported -could not fail of giving offence. In lookiing over lhis journals it is amusing to see how he chafes under authority, how he longs for absolute qpower, and how pleased he is to tell that the ,tribes under his dominion salute him as king. lIe is perfectly happy under Lord Ellenborough, -because be can do what he likes; when Lord -Ellenborough departs India becomes intoleTable,-" a ring of gold withouit its jewel," "an *empty house full only of cursed bugs." Sometimes 'be is mad because obliged to write civilly to a superior, say that "imbecile" that " packass" Lord Ripon :-" The hottest day in Scinde never made ,ny blood boil as this man did! Yet I begin, 'My -dear Lord Ripon !' God forgive me ! I ought to be hanged, but it is one of those unpleasant things I do for the public service." Sometimes Me pours out abuse upon the civil servants of the sCompany, whom he describes as lazy, extravagant wretches, swilling beer and champagne from mnornmg to night, and having a separate ser-vant to -wash every distinct toe. Sometimes he launches forth upon "the ruflians," "the anony-mous villains" of the Indian press, who, if it be true that they called him " liar, traitor, thief, coward, a feUow who disgraced the glorious age of Wellington, a knight whose spurs should be hacked off his heels," certainly carried the attack too far, .although it must be confessed that they had a strong temptation to sport with a tartar who could write in {his vein-" Don't expect me ever to be in a good 'temper until I am in my coffin, unless I can kill an -editor," and whose idea of meekne-s was conveyed in the folowing terms-" I never feel angry in my heart against anyono-.beyond wishing to break their -bones with a broomstick." Poor fellow! he writhed under the most lenient criticiam, even when he declared himnself "callous as a biiffalo's horn." Of the press generally he says, " they would abuse the Almighty God if He came on earth ;" and this journal comes in for its share of those elegant insinuations which the Napiers have so largely at com,nand. One scarcely knows how to deal with a man -to whom everything turns up amiss-who considers qour praise worthless because it is extorted by public opinion, and by a regard to our own interests, and who considers our blame infamous because -coming from concealed assassins armed with irreaponsible power. No one knew better than he -who spoke of shooting an editor that aU this outcry which public men are so fond of raising against -anonymous articles and irresponsible opponents is -the merest twaddle; and that, in point of fact, anewspaper criticism is not a bit more anonymous than the book upon Napier's policy which has ,Colonel Outram's name on the title-page, although dt was not written by tbe Colonel (at least, so says Sir WiMiamNapier,who thinks that he was too illiterate.) With all their affected hatred of the public press, the Napiers never could resist the temptation to make use -of it, either directly or indirecty, when it suited their purposes; and so well was this passion of the -Oenerals knowfn that on his la>st expedition to India the Duke took leave of him by sayinig "M Mind, -no writing to the newspapers." If he did not write himself his brother wrote for him, and we must take leave to say that there seems to be something disingenuous in the attempt to clear Sir Charles Napier from all responsibility for his publications on Scinde, with every word of which he agreed, the tone of which he inspired, and the information of which he in great part afforded. L et this and all his other inHconsistencies pass. The hotheaded Sheitan-ka-bhaee Ihad a thousand personal brawls, which will be forgotten when his service to the State wiU be remnembered with honour. He said of himself, "A bad felow I am in many ways, but I feel no intentional wickedness, on my conscience. My worst sin is the wish to shoot Outram, as he deserves." Premising thus much as to his personal relations in the new sphere of action to which he was called, and keeping in mind that, although nothing can justify the loss of temper or the violation of law, still a man of vigour must in these days have his -patience sorely tried when, through the insolence of - office, the delays of routine, the doubts, the ignorance, and the accidents of a system under which .ten heads do the work of one and nobody bears the responsibility, he finds money wasted, opportunities lost, and great designs retarded, we resume the narrative of Napier's Indian career, upon which he entered at an age when other men think more of dinner than of victory, more of the gong than of the drum. At -60 a General may be considered old and untit for service in the field. If his faculties are un.dimmed, the lapse of years will probably have *shaken his strength and cooled not a little the ardour of his blood. Yet, if at that age Sir Charles Napier had died, or if he had shrunk not simply from active service, but from active service in the fierce cliniate of India, he would have gone to his grave unk-no wn save as the hero of a hundred official squabbles. At this crisis the chances were so much against hini that the insurauce-offices refused to -aecept his life, and the reasons which led to this refusal only stirred him up the more eagerly to grasp .at the Indian command. He had not long to live, ,he had made no provision for his family, and he was determ1ined to risk everything for his daughters. It is necessary to bear this in mind as affording -a cllue to the vilest charge that was afterwards brought against him. It was said, and conspi-cuously by Lord Grey when it was proposed in the :Iouse of Commons to pass a vote of thauks to the -General, that he plunged the country into a war with the Ameem for the sake of the prize-money. Bitterly did Napier, in whose beart there was no sordid taint, feel this reproach, the only real ground for -which was the blunt honesty which made him cnfess that nothing but love for his girls-nothing, -therefore, but a resolution to make money-would -have induced him to leave England. "HIIad I thou -,died not a farthing was left for them. At Bombsy the purser received my ]ast monev-a bill for 5001., n payment of the voyage from Suez, and returned -1." Whatever he may ultimately have amassed, he declared when this accusation was urged against Ihim, when Scinde was at his feet, and when he was -nupposed to have gained hundreds of thousands, -that he had realized of what he termed " the ready rhino" but 12,0001., certainly not an extravagant sum -o have been acquired in two and a-half years by a man who was lord paramount of a most fertile province, whom the Anmeers would gladly have appeased 'with lacs upon lacs, and with strings of pearls anld diionds, who drew a. very large salary, and whose personal wants were FO few that his ideaX of a noldier's comkfort consisted in two towels and a - - .- J lic 7I vptJlums of (ienrrat wr CIhares James &apier, CJ3.: by Lieutenant-General Sir W. NAP.ER, . .B., io 4 vOl. Vols 3 and 4. London: John Murray. piece of soap for baggage, a hunch of bread and a drink of water for sustenanice. It may be remembered that Sir Charles Napier was despatched to Scinde very sooii after his arrival in India, and here his troubles at once began. By right of a treaty which Lord Auckland isegotiated with the Ameers we had a certain privileged footing in Scinde, Major Outram, as political agent, being the chief guardian of our interests. Naturally enough, the Belooch princes seized the opportunity of our reverses in Affghanistan to evade the treaty, threatening to drive us from their territory. It became necessary, therefore, to overawe them -to bring military force in aid of political influence, and for this purpose Sir Charles Napier was sent by Lord Ellenborough with supreme authority, almost with carte blanche. Outram and his staff of political agents were in point of fact superseded, the pen giving way to the sword, and the civii expeuses reduced at once by 6,0001. a-year. Outram's services were still retained, but he was only an adviser and had Do real power. Oat of this transaction arose all Sir Charles Napier's miseries. The change was necessary, but it appears to have been effected with unsparing rigour, and, when coupled with the contemptuous opinion of the service which he had not hesitated to express, it was regarded as insulting. The "Politicals " on the spot soon gave signs of jealousy; their friends at Bombay soon gave signs of resentment. At first Napier is all admiration of Outram, asks his opinion, takes his advice. By degrees they begin to differ,-Outram, true to his vocation, objecting to bloodshed and wishing to treat,-Napier true to himself, hopeless of diplomacy, and eager for the fray. The General of course carries his point, to the great dis-gust of the Political Commissioner, who takes an early opportunity of quiitting the scene of his fruitless labour s. Then Napier gradually discovers that the Commissioner is a "humbug" and a "simpleton," while Outram concludes that the conquering General is a tyrant and a bloodthirsty monster. At length Outrana is in the eyes of Sir Charles an ass, a base wretch, a poor charlatan, without natural ability or acquired kuowledge; while in the eyes of Outram's friends the Governor of Scinde is a blackguard, a villain, a traitor, a murderer capable of any atrocity, a liar, the disgrace of his age. The controversy spreads-Directors, Governors, GovernorsGeneral, Cabinet Ministers take a tacit part in it. A man cannot admire the victories of Napier without being an enemy to Outram and his Bombay partisans; poor Lord Hardinge cannot present Outram at Court without being false to his friend Sir Charles. Finally Napier becomes monomaniacal on the subject of Colonel Outram. The name of his great enemy appears in every page. It is gall and wormwood to hear him described as the ablest man in India, and when some indiscreet admirer says that as a soldier the Colonel is superior to Napoleon, althoughnot quite equal toWellington, the Sheitan-ka-bhaee is in ecstacies, and one can fancy him dancing the devil's hornpipe on the occasion. He has a savage exulbation in recording a family a4iction, which, if there was the slightest ground for believing it, ought rather to have softened his heart :-" Outram I do believe is mad. His brother cut his own throat." From Outram his hatred spreads to double detestation of the East India Directors, who had not dismissed him from their service. His enemy is every day of his life committing some ridiculous blunder or some fearful crime, and tne authorities have not a word to say against him; but, on the contrary, cover him with new honours and intrust him with higher commands. Then Leadenhall-street becomes " Leadenhead-street ;" the Company is a " pernicious oligarchy ;" truly did Lord Wellesley describe the Directors as "I the ignominious tyrants of the East ;" "My hope is to see the republican Directors smashed ;" " would that every insulting word Lord Ellenborough used towards the Court of Directors were a 13-inch shell !" In all this hurricane of abuse it is not difficult to perceive that Outram might very justly feel aggrieved at being so summarily extinguished in Scinde by the joint act of Lord Ellenborough and Sir Charles Napier; and that without being an ass, or a base wretch, or a charlatan, he might-even if a little personal jealousy added strength to his viewsdispute the propriety of annexing Scinde and maintain the efficacy of more lenient measures. At the same time, judging the affair after the eventjudging it also in the light of the Punjab campaigns, which cost us so much anxiety and so much blood, just because in the first instance we were long suffering, were willing to parley, and hesitated to strike hard, it appears that the seizure of Scinde was a political as well as a strategic necessity. "Moderation!" said Napier, when he heard that Hardinge at the end of his first campaign had come to terms with the Sikhs, "Moderdevil ! Real moderation would have seized the whole Punjab. If we make a slip in this purgatorial moderation-a little blessed, a little damneddown we go to the devil in politics." His views, indeed, with regard to the policy of annexation were extreme, and might well provoke hostility, for they would justify the seizureof Constantinople byRussia, or of Cuba by the United States. " Were I Emperor of India," he said, when his views were most matured, " no Indian prince should exist." He would dethrone the Nizam, he would seize Nepaul: without the abolition of the native sovereigntiei no great good could be effected, and the Company's revenues must always be in difficulty. " Would that I were King. I would make Moscowa and Pekin shake." In carrymg out this policy, however, he had a strong feeling that nobody should annex, nobody should goverm but himself. The annexation of Oude was a vile proceeding, because it transferred that unhappy kingdom from a single tyrant to a legion of " ignominious tyrants," and because it was accomplished by Lord Dalhousie, who was actuated chiefly by personal spite, arising out of the absurd storv that when his father was Commander-in-Chief, and introduced his wife to the King of Oade, His Majesty, not understanding Enalish customs, fancied that the lady was for sale, ana after a short time said to his attendants, " That will do, take her away." It is rather strange that the Napiers, who denounce the seizure of Oude as an act of spoliation, should yet think it infamous for any one to deprecate the taking possession of Scinde. Sir Charles, it is true, declared that " the conquest of Scinde never entered his head until after Meeanee ;" yet months before that battle he writes in his journal what we quoted in a previous article-" We have no right to seize Scinde, yet we shall do so, and a very advantageous, useful, humane piece of rascality it will be." Humane it was, because these Ameers were "such atrocious tyrants that it was virtuous to roll them over like ninepins." Advantageous it was, because it substituted a strong frontier for a weak one on that side of India. It was even necessary as being essential to the defence of the Northwest provinces, and as in the excited state of the hiU tribes after the disasters of Cabul it seemed otherwise impossible to compel the observance of solemn treaties. What right we originally had to enter Scinde is quite another question; but once thera it was our duty to assert our privileges and to defend our position. This Sir Charles :Napier proceeded to do with great energy. It is not possible to follow him through all his negotiations with the Ameers, and in all his marches and counter-marches up and down the Indtds; but we shall indicate some of the leading facts. He very soon ceased to negotiate and appealed to arms. It was what the Talpoor princes wanted, for they hoped to overpower him by numbers, and in any case they felt certain that they could elude him in their desert fortresses. To compel them to fight, and to show that it was impossible for them to elude him, Napier determined on an enterprise, which at the time was described by his opponents as a wildgoose chase, which the Duke described as one of the most curious military feats he had ever heard of, and which afterwards probably saved the General a good deal of trouble. Emaum Ghur was a fortress so far away in the desert that it was believed by the Ameers to be impregnable, a fastness on which they might always fall back without fear of being pursued. " lVhere one man goes anotherman can," said Napier, and with 50U soldiers he chased the enemy into the desert, pounced upon Emaum Ghur after a seven days' march, blew it up, and returned to his army after an absence of 18 days. Having thus brought the Ameers to bay he fought about a month afterwards-namely, on the 17th of February, 1843, the terrible battle of Meeanee. On his side were 2,000 men; opposed to him were 35,000 Beloochees. "Let them be 100,000, I will fight." There was, indeed, such a disparity of numbers that in sendilg an account of the battle to the Horse Guards he half apologizad for his audacity :-" If I have done wirong, it. was the Great M-uter led rae into error. The Duke's letter on Colonel Monson's retr eat decided me never to retreat before an Indian army." The fight,which was conducted very much on the principle of foot to foot and point topoint, lasIed four hours, the combatants being the whole time only some four or five yards asunder. Napier won the battle with the loss of only 300, while the loss of the enemv was more than 6,000. His own cool courage was nobly seconded by that of his men-by the 22d Regiment especially-and for the first time in modern English history, says Sir W. Napier, the valour of non-commissioned officers and private soldiers was recognized by name in the despatch giving an account of tbis great victory, by whichHyderabad fell into our hands. Hyderabad surrendered the day aEter the battle, and with it immense treasures became the prize of the conquerors. A still greater amount might have been taken, but that 'Napier allowed the Ameers four days for the removal of their ladies and all their private property. It was ascertained that these ladies carried away with them property to the value of two millions sterling. One thing they took good care to leave behind-it was the whip for flogging them, which was found banging up in Nusseer Khan's zenana, and which had two lashes made of twisted brass wire. It was, by the way, one of the strongest charges brought against Napier that he had dealt very harshly with these women; but all the evidence, and especially that of his character, goes to establish the very contrary; and one fact may be mentioned, as showing how easily the many enemies wbom he had created could distort into crimes the most harmless of his actions. The wife of one of the Ameers, pretending tobe in what Mrs. Gamp would call " a bittiwation vich blessed is the man as has his quiver full of sech," sent for a ctate bedstead profusely mounted with pure gold. The prize agent sent word that she might have any bedstead but that one, and the princess, not choosing to take any other, suddenly got well, and was confined long afterwards at her private residence. By the time this story reached Bombay it appeared that Sir C. Napier, in order to swell the prize money, had directed the agent to Eseize a miserable truckde bed on which a princess was lying in her hour of greatest need! Great as was the victory of Meeanee, the Ameers were repulsed, not subdued, and Napier had now to defend his position until he could obtain reinforcements to contend against overwhelming odds. Soon reinforcements came, and in about five weeks after Meeanee with 5,000 men he routed 26,000 of the enemy, who were strongly intrenched in triple lines at Dubba, and fought with wonderful ferocity. Sir WilliamNapier has given few details of the order of battle, rightly thinking that the subject belongs rather to the history of the conquest, which he has already published, than to the biography of his brother. One little incident subsequent to the battle is curious. Everybody disliked to call the battle after the village of Dubba, because that is the name in the district for a skin of grease. "All the boys were horrified at the name, and MIacmurdo (Napier's son-ialaw) rode about bleeding like a pig to find another village to call it after." Lord Ellenborough settled that it should be called after Igyderabad; and for " the twvo glorious battles of Meeanee and Hryderabad," as they were characterized by Wellington, Sir Charles Napier now obtained the thanks of Parliament. "The thanks of Parliament ! Who cares for them? Not L I want no thanks from the placehunters who infest St. Stephen's," said the surly old felow, while all the time his vanity was rarely tickled. Suppose he had received no thanks, what a hubbub he would have created! for practically by these two battles he had conquered Scinde. Many of the chiefs submitted to him, and he introduced them to Chalon's print of his Royal mistress, or, if he forgot to do so, they always asked for the Padisha, and Napier proclaimed her power, while to the lower orders he proclaimed her virtues, instructing his interpreter to roar aloud that " the Queen is the Father of all the oor." All the Princes, however, had not submitted, and the Lion, the Shere Mohammed, was still at large., Napier seized upon his capital, compelled him to fly, baffled his combinations, dispersed his army, and became complete master of Scinde-the conquest not costing the Company one shiling. To complete his triumph he had the mountain tribes still to subdue, and, with admirable forethought and skill, he arranged a campaign towards the Cutchee district, in which there was not much fighting, but a good deal of clever manceuvring. It was on the occasion of sending home an account of his skirmishing operations in the Cutchee hiUls that Lord Ripon wrote to him-" You make too much of these outpost affairs." Napier never forgave that remark; and, perhaps, it was too rougbly worded; yet, although it is impossible not to admit the importance of the hill campaign, and the signal ability with which it was conducted against many thousands of these robbers, still it was scarcely necessary to mention every little passage of arms, every little turning of a deffle in this guerilla warfare, even if to accomplish the grand result the old General had to stick to his salddle 22 hours at a time. The grand result was that the mountain tribes were completely subjugated, the ehiefs coning to him with the Koran on their heads and dismay in their hearts to lay their jewelled swords at his feet. After Meeanee Lord EUenborough proclaimed the annexation of Scinde; after Dubba he appointed Napier its governor, with absolute control. It rejoiced the heart of the conqueror, who immediately set himself to consolidate his power and to develope the resources of the country. His first object was to make the Beloochees, the Scindees, and the Hindoos who peopled the territory of the Indus, understand that British rule was preferable to the despotism of the Talpoor princes. He at once therefore reduced their burdens, and made the most vigorous efforts to put down the system of pilage and blackmail, warfare and assassination, infanticide and suttee, which prevailed in these primitive regions. The Beloochees were in the habit of descending from their mountains upon the unhappy villagers of the plain, killing the men and women, and cutting off little children's hands. Among the Scindees wife-kiling was the favourite sport. On the slightest provocation the poor wretch of a wife was chopped to pieces, the husband pulled out his knife and cut off her nose, her lips, and her ears If he suspected her virtue he twisted his hand in her long hair and backed off her head, which, indeed, was the milder punishment. When tired of this kind of sport they turned to another which was equaly admired. The lovely odalisques of Scinde had a numerous illegitimate offspring. On the occasion of a birth the fond father took the child, placed a cushion upon it, and calmly seated himself crosslegged upon this ingeniously constructed divan, smoking his pipe and cracking his jokes. To these fashionable amusements Napier worked hard to put an end; and while using very severe measures to repress cruelty and injustice, as well as to throw vigur into the decisions of his courts-martial, which had become " so legal and so wise that there was not the slightest chance of convicting the greateat scoundrel, " he endeavoured to conciliate the people by the relaxation of tribute, by the remission of debts, and by the free gift of lands of which previously they had only been tenants at will. He introduced windmills into the country, had his model farm as at Cepha- lonia, had a 1sa-ge model garden at Kurrachee, constructed canals and roads, built barracks, organized an efficient police, which was afterwards imitated in the Punjab, and created for his army two camel corps, one for fighting with guns, the other, more important, for baggage. It was very much froni the lessons obtained in the preparation of this latter force that Colonel MIacmurdo subsequently was able to raise and to manage as he did the Land Transport Corps in the Crimea. Why Napier's camel corps was finally disbanded we are not prepared to say, but so it was, to the great indignation of the brothers, who attribute the act to personal spite on the part of Lord Dalhousie and the Directors. To the same motive they ascribe the extinction of many other plans in the success of which Sir Charles was much interested. They have no idea that the crest displayed on the cover of these volumes-a hand grasping the moon-is not a bad emblem of many of Sir Charles's schemnes. During the latter part of his res;dence in Scinde Napier was ill at ease. He was mad about Outram, he was disgusted with the Bombay Government, he was not quite content with Lord Hardinge, who, althouigh full of kindness and consideration,;still as a General had plans of his own, which were not those of the hero of Scinde. He seized the opportunity of his wife's illness to resign his command in the summer of 1847. He did not, however, return directly to England, bat passed acme time on the continent. He travelled through France in 1848, while it was still in all the ferment of- revobktNi3, and loitering throuigh Puris, w)iom,~ Ehould he meet but 7arshal Soultt A pleasant interview for Sir Charles, who in his first battle was opposed to this French General, and, in point of fact, although nobody knew it at the timo, was the real winner of the victory of Corumna Now that Napier comes home a great conqueror from Scinde what does the celebrated Marshal think of him? " He paid me the highest compliments, as he had studied aU my operations in China ! and entirely approved them." This was certainly mortifying, and Napier generalizes as follows:-" Depend upon it that when a French soul is damned, it puts on a great coat and compliments the Devil on his fine climate-though un pea froid." We cannot help suspecting, however, that on this, as on many other occasions, the Greneral's cantankerous temper betrayed him into the commission of a gross blunder, in attributing to Soult a piece of flattery of which we believe him to have been incapable. Which is the more likely-that Soult should have told a lie in order to gratify the General, or that the General should have misunderstood the Marshal's pronunciation, andhavemistakein "Scinde" for " Chine ?" The Devil's great brother, however, received very different compliments in England. He had to go through the eternal round of dinners and toasts, public addresses and private congratulations, with which the EngEsh people welcome their heroes. To give a climax to these compliments, Sir Robert Peel came up to him one evening in a drawing-room and said " Were I to begin life again, and be a soldier, i would enlist under you in preference to any other General.' Poor old Napier, who could dine off a crust of bread and a cupful of etagnant water, and who was by no means given to compliment, was at once bothered and flattered by these attentions. It is amusing to read of the straits to which he was put when he had to dine with the Queen. By way of Court dress he borrowed a magnificent waistcoat from his valet. In the midst of " these effusions of fish and folly," as he described the feasting, came news of the battle of Chillianwallah. The country was alarmed, and the cry was that none but Napier could redeem the character of our arms. "Either you or I must go," said the Duke of Wellington. There was great hesitation, for Napier bad made himself exceedingly disagreeable to the East India Directors. The appointment was offered to bis brother George, and was by him declined; then Gomm was appointed, and he actually sailed from the MHauritius to take the command; finally, Napier superseded Gomm. But, in order to give him as little power as pOSsible, it was proposed to withhold from him a seat in the Supreme Council. Lord John Russell rather awkwardly informed him that the Directors were seeking for a precedent to deprive him of that appointment. Jum ing to his feet and extending his clinched hand, NYapier cried, -" Look here, Lord John ! if they can't find a precedent for my going out with a seat, I will, by God, find one for a Commander-in-Chief not going out when offered the situation." So Napler got the appointment, peace was ratified over a public dinner, the General packed up his two towels and his piece of soap, and went to India with tho shouts of the nation after him. His position with regard to Lord Gough was delicate, but all was smoothed by the good-heartedness of the latter. " Gough is a glorious old fellow, brave as ten lions, each with two sets of teeth and two tails," he wrote before this encounter, and now he wrote" I like that noble old fellow Goughmore than ever; he is so good, so honest, sonoble-minded." With Lord Dalbousie his interview was equally cordial, although in a different style. The first words of the GovernorGeneral were-" I have been warned, Sir Charles Napier, not to let you encroach upon my authority, and I will take - good care you shall not." Sir William Napier describes this brusque address as vulgar insolence, and thinks that his brother would have been justified in retorting by tosing the Queen's commission in Lord Dalhousie's face. It must be evident that it depends entirely upon the manner of the speaker whetter such an address should be interpreted as an insult or an expression of extreme cordiality on the part of a man who wished to be on the best of terms with the Commander-in-Chief, who knew the difficulties of being so consistently with self-respect, and who thus frankly offered to break the ice and come to a clear understanding. Sir Charles seemas to have taken the advance in good part, and during the first few weeks of his new command speaks in glowing terms of the support he receives from the Governor-GeneraL He rather pooh-poohs him as a young man and a novice in Indian affairs, but on the whole he is disposed to pat Lord Dalhousie on the back as wonderfully good, all things being considered, and very promising. Napier was sent out to fight. The Directors had no idea that he would set himself primarily to reform the discipline of the army. Yet this is the task to which he now bent his energies, giving his directions with a vigour that was always amusing, if not always salutary. "How the devil could I make soldiers attend by sending a civil message to a rascal a thousand miles off? By the Lord Harry it won't do; oak trees cannot be chopped down with penknives, and so I must and do use the hatchet." His general idea of the army was expressed in the following terms when he joined theBombay division in 1842:-"The general framework of this army is bad. The offlcers appear better staff-officers than ours, but as regimental officers worse." The Indian army had been subject to mutinies, and Napier attributed this distemper to the regimental system, by which the older officers got good civil appointments, while regiments were left to the care of boys. "That officers do civil duties far better than civil servants I have not the slightest doubt, but then there ought to be more officers." These and other arrangements now occupied his mind, but he felt that he had no real power to change the Bystem. He did not even know the number of his army. " I could never arrive at any exact calculation." The old General fretted his life away over these arrangements, which certainly were not perfect, and no doubt he gave the people about him immense trouble by his complaints aud fidgetting. Ere long when he finds that Lord Dalhousie does not fulfii his expectations in carrying out his views in every direction, the Governor-General comes in for a pretty round of epithets-" poor little pig"-" this little goose"-"the miserable little weasel"-" aJesuitical fellow"-"this little great Marquis, the Laird of Cockpen.'k " He is weak as water and vain as a pretty woman." This sort of criticism could scarcely be so common as it is in Napier'sjournals and private correspondence without finding its way into his conversation, and affecting to some extent his official despatches. The Commander-in-Chief was, in fact, a firebrand in the midst of the Supreme Council, and the first opportunity was seized to get rid of him. Discontent was prevalent among the regiments of the Punjab, the Governor-General was absent on account of his health, and the responsibility lay with Sir Charles Napier. In order to satisfy the demands of certain of the Sepoys, he suspended for one month an order of the Supreme Council with regard to the rations. FormaUy it was a very slight affair, involving a loss to the Company of not more than 91. 6s. Still it was a palpable violation of principle, and in the very first words addressed to him by Lord Dalhousie Napier was forewarned as to the conse- quences of overstepping his authority. Had any other Commander-in-Chief commoitted this error it might have been overlooked; committed by Sir Charles Napier, with the character which he had earned, it could not have been overlooked. He was reprimanded publicly. " The Governor-General in Council will not again permit the Commander-inChief under any circumstances to issue orders which shall change the pay and allowances of the troops serving in India." In a minute which was afterwards drawn up by Lord Dalhousie it was stated that the ration and! muitiny inuestion was not the real ground for the reprimand; the real ground was this-" the style of the Commander-in-Chief's correspondence had become offe4wive.- Farewell to Tndia. Sir Charles Napier resigned his command and returned to his family, who had taken up their abode near Portsmouth. So a few years afterw=ads, with even heartier acclamations, anothms Sir Charles went forth to the Baltic as the clampion of England, did nothing but grumble and. write letters about the want of disci~ pline inhis soce, andm returned home tostrikehis flag and give up his appointment. The General retired to. Oaklands. to brood over his wrongs, to mutter cexrses against cle East India directors, and to meditato on the m'Ateries of creation. " I do not kno v why t'he good (od afflicts England with Whigs and bvgs, but he ';.oes so, aud we all work towards some wondrous er d." Poor Sir Charles, instead of going into Par]IAament to bluster about his wrongs, threw off his auperabundant energy by continually going to law. At one time it was to get damages for the loss of his dog, at -another tirae to get dannisges for the low of his character. His last public appearance was at the Duke of Wellington's funerals where he assisted as a pall-bearer, and caught a severe cold from which he never entirel rallied. On the 29th oF Auut, 1853, he died surrounded by his family-died like a soldier, on a carop bedxtj the old colours of the 22d Reginent that had pasae( through all the smoke of Meeanee and Hyderabad wraving over his head.

AR JO0lN BRIGHT AND PARLIAMEN- TARY BEFOPRM. The following letter has been received by Mr. Alexander Laing, Hawick, in acknowledgment of certain resolutionsof sympathy with Messrs. Cobden Bright, and Gibson, on the result of the Huddersfield and Blanchester elections, passed at a meeting held in that town some weeks ago. A letter on the subject fromi Mr. Cobden has already been pab. lished. "Geneva, May 17,1857. "Dear Sir,-Your kind note, enclosing a copy of the resolution passed at a public meeting of the inhabitants of Eawick, reachod me only last evening. I lode no time in writing to say that I am very glad to find that in your town the cause of reform, free trade, and 'retrenchment has so many warm friends, and that you have understood and approved the policy which Mr. Cobden, Mr. Gibson, and myself have supported in the House of Commons. In the question of free trade,little progress has been made for some years past; as to retrenchment, the word has become almost obsolete, and the military expenditure of the country is now nearly double the amount which the Duke of Wellington and Sir IRobert Peel thonght neceseAry in 1835, although we have no more territory to defend, and although a large army is no longer necessary to maintain tranquiUity in Ireland. As to reform, while almost everybody professes to be in favour of it in some shape, the preparation of the particular Bil to be brought forward next year is left in the hands of a Minister whose hostility to every proposition for reform since the year 1832 is notorious and undeniable. Whether on these three points to which your resolution refers the country is in a satisfactory position I must leave the friends of free trade, reform, and retrenchment to decide. " With regard to the promised reform lot me warn you to look not more to the question of franchise than to the other arrangements of the measure. It would be easy to double the number of electors and at the same time to increwe the aristocratic influence in Parliament. To give votes without giving representatives in some fair degree in proportion to the votes is bat to cheat the people; and to give a large increase of votes without the secuzity of the ballot wiU subject increased numbers of our countrymen to the degradmg influences which wealth and power now exerise so unscrupulously upon the existing electoral body. A moderate measure, and an honest one so far as it goes, is far more to be desired than one of great pretensions with some fraudulent scheme for defeating tho wishes of the nation. A dishonest apportionment of members may effec. tuay destroy a representation; and any trick to obstruct the free action of majorities, such as that proposed in Lord John RuacelPs Last Bill, should be strenuouly resisted, as calculated to undermine the very basis of representative institutions, and designed only to cheat the people of that increased power which the Bill would profess to confer upon them. "Whether I shall ever again in Parliament support the poacy you approve is extremely unoertain, bat I shall always retain a grateful sense of the kindness which I have received in put times, and at the present time, from the intellgent community on whose behalf yon have written to me.-Bellove me to be very sincerely yours, " To Alex. Laing, Esq., Hawick. JOHNE BRIGHT.1

HYDE PARK. TO THE EDITOIR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-There isa slight change which should be made in the qsytem of farming now canied on in Hyde Park. It would in no degree diminish the revenue derived from the pasture, axdwouldadd materially to the cleanliness of the place. Cows ought to be excluded, and their plaoes filledby sheep. This step has been taken in all the other parks under Sir Benjamin Hall's jurisdiction with the very best resulta. The herbage becomes finer, more money is obtained for it, and the walks and grass are not dirtied and disfigured as they are in Hyde Park by the cows I am told that the cattle belong to the deputy-ranger, who, notwithstanding that a space of soveral acres is railed off for their use, allows them to iange over the whole park, much to the inconvenience of the pubic. I have no doubt that if you will allow this circumstance to meet tho eyes of the Ranger, by admitting it into your columns, his Royal Highness will at once give orders that his deputys dairy shall cease to annoy ns, the frequenters of the park. ar__ n a I am, Sir, your obedient sersant, A ' Y-BUBaiINI. -j -
ST. JAIzS's PARt.-The water, such as it iS, supplied by the water companies to the parks has hitherto cost Government 1,6 40I. a-year; bat a discovery has been made during the recent alterations, which, it is supposed, tWill effect a saving of one-half this sum. In that island, surrounded by the ornamental waters of St. James's Park, which the " Merry Monarch" named Dack Island, and of which he onoe appointed St. Evremont Governor, there was found to exist a powerful spring, yielding pare water in sufficient abandance to supply the whole lake, and perhaps to prove *vailable for other purPoses. From a well of 10 reet wide, sunk to a depthof 25 feet, 510oo gallons of water a minute are now obtained; and it is anticipated that a stiUl larger supply wil be attainable. The water evidently comes from the Thames, being filtered on its pssage through a bed of sand two-thirds of a mile in thickness.-0bscrm:a We are requested to state that Mr. Laurie paired with Mr. J.

REJECTOY OF THE D As-C0LA REio, TREATy. -The fact has been widely braited that the Clarendon. Dallas treaty, supplementary to and explanatory ef the Clayton-Btdwer treaty, after having been cut and carved out of all similitude of its former self by the United States Senate, has received the finishing blow from the British Cabinet; yet up to this hour we have not happened to meet one expression of regret for the circumstance. That it has been received with surprise at Washington we shall be slow to believe; for al Government which I so maims and mutilates a treaty, negotiated with a first-class Power by its representative of the highest grade, has no right to expect that the disfigured remains will be meekly acoepted as if it had undergene na change. Our Government had a right, through the achon of the Senate, to make the alterations,-Great Britain as good a right to esejct them. Thus the treaty is demolished; and if there be any mourners to go about our street8 (since Mr. Dallas stiU traverses in contented dignity those of London) they certainly are too few To raLse a dust. The Clayton-Bulwer treaty was, under the circumstances, an. international necessity. The Panama road was required.; yet capitalists could not be expected to furnish the money tberefor if their road, when comn pleted, Was lihble to be closed any moment by a war iro which any two. great commercial Powers were engage-i That treaty was in main a good one, and refleits credit ou the contracting parties. That the subsequ3ag conduct of oither hAs fofly sustained that credit, in view of onr naval exploit at Greytown, our Fiidbusiers' ravages in.Nicaragu, and GreatBritain's seizure of Rvaan, is no; so. clear.

He is about to commit tba petty transgression of abducting a aovice from a onvent, by force of arms, hut so touchingly does he sing of tbh brightness of her eye that he becomtes for the while a per. son with whom people sympathize. Lastly, there is the gipsyAzucena, a vengeful Nemesis, who triumphs in the end, but who dwells so patheticaUy on her past wrongs ana sufferings, and has so much present sufering to put up with, that she excites pity rathor than terror, and makea one more in the list of interesting personages, Whether we-regard the pert which thecharacters take in the storyor the per;rt whiel they take in the music, we may safely assert that few operas exhibit so many objects of sympathy as iA Zroi.aoie. On Satarday night there were many eauses to make thhis interesting opera more than usually attractive. In the, first place, there was a new characbter for Signor GiugRlin which would call forth all the resources of his voice and hi= talent, and the successive triumphs of Signor Giuglni are important events in the lyrical season. In the secod place, Mademoiselle Spezia had only been heard in on. character (the other Leonora in La FaZvrit) ana& had given sufficient evidence of histriosK genius to awaken a strong desire to aee her in a new part, In ther third place, the Azacena of Madame Alboni was acknowledged last year to be one of the mostperfectimpersonations, botn musical and dramatic, ever seen upon any stage. Let these considerations be added to the hard fact that IAJoTs.v. torn is one of themost populxrworksintho modernrepertory and it may be readily understood that the homse on Saturday night was one of the most brilliant and crowded of th. season. Mademoiselle Spezia has more than justified expectations. Theuppernotes are certainly less at her command atan those of the lower register, but her dramatic expression isvery fine, and, on some occasions, when the audience least expeoK anything of the sort, they find themselves overpvwe=edbY a burst of vocal eloGquence that compels them to acknowledge, tho presence of gekius. This was particularly the case ithfamous "Miaerere' in the fourth act. Signor Giuglini may add his Manrico to his Artoro and Edgardo. As sooa as his voice was heard bebind the raen warbling forth " Deserto sulla terra," a general round of applause marked the recognition of the popular favourite. Bat, as usual, he delayed the moment of his ebief triumph to the latter part of the opera. Whether it is ths re5lt of a profound policy, or whetheras an evening adva&ne his. feelings gradually identify themselves with those of tha character assumed, certain it is that, instead of consuming the enthusiasm of his hearers at the commenceaent of & rformance, Signor Giuglini delights them the more the, K9herthe opera progresses. "Ah si -ben mio," the air towards the close of the third act, sung when aUrice. is about to lead his bride to the altar, was one aC those perfect things by which Signor Giuglini so COAmpleteyenchainsbisandiencethat tbeymustlisenandadmfrein spite of themselves, one of those quiet exhibitieons of exeel2enoe in which it is hard to say whether we are 3eogh entranced by the sentiment of the vocalist or the fauitlessness of the vocalization. The allegro, " Di quella pira," in which he breathes forth hisrage and horrorat the impending fate of Azucena, was an outburst of passionate singig that. electrified the hearers like the deance of Arturo in r Puritani, and Was followed by a roar of approbation. What can those critics mean who, while they admnit that GiuA is a correct singer, declare that he is deficient in on * As Arturo and as Edgardo the man has snng witha his. heart and soul, and stirred the hearts and souls of every one who has heard him, and it is hard to guess what al&. ll> draught of song is desired by those who we not yet eontent. Both this altegro and the " Misexero" in the following ac suigwith immense feeling by Signor Giuglini and Mademoiselle Spezia, were rapturously encored. Indeed,so hearlywas. the applause, that although Manrico, whose voice Was heard behind the scenes, was supposed to be safely locked up is a certain tower, he felt that the wil of thepublic was stronpr than the bolts of his dungeon, and therefore, opening m prison-door, he gravely came forward aud made his bow. As fortheAzucenaof MadameAlboni,ftisinevery respet. a grt work. When she tells the terrible story of her mother's fate, and reverts to the still more horible mistae that she herself committed, her perfect voealization is rendered doubly effective by the eloquence oE ber countenance and her gestures.

Enthusisstic applause was given at the end of the opera and at the intervals between the acts in all the forms or which it is susceptible (including 'cals'" innumerble) - and, what is far more worthy of record, there was hea4 throughout the evening that best sort of appluse tht does not manifest itself on stated occasionm,but burss forth spontaneously when some new excellence is displayed.

FOREIGN INTBLLIGEYCE. I FRANCE. (FROM OUR OWN COURSPONDINT.) eA P irtron of the foUolog appe3rcd In our cocond 1t1lou of Saturdiv -1 ir&AL, .IURIDAY) SlAY X4, ti P.M. A letter from Rome of the 17th mentions that he Pope was still at Macerata, wvhere he waa well received by the population. He wras to leave on the 18th for Ancon, where great fetes wvere in prepara. tion for hun. A number of foreign ships of wsr had arrived in that port for the occasion. The French, Austrian, Neapolitan, and Spanish Consuls established at Ancona had come to Macerata to meet His H3oliness, who was accompanied by a very tifling escort. The very favourable reception he continued to meet with from the people was still considered as a sign that the Pope's intention is to grant certain reforms in the administration before his return to Rome. The funeral of M. Vieillard, Senator, the old friend of the Emperor, and the preceptor of his brother, took place to-day. It was attended by a considerable number of persons, either known as public men or as distinguished in letters and tcience, and who desired to pay their tribute of respectto his memory. According to the last wishes of the deceased, the funeral was very simple. It was expected that, in accordance with the general usage, the remains would be borne to the church for the religiousceremony, and it is said thatthe usual notificationswereissuedforthatpurpose. Averyshorttime, however, before the hour came for removing the body a document was found in which, to the sur- rise of every one, the deceased had expressly pro. hibited his remains being taken to any church, but that they should be carried directly from his house to the burialplace. The Archbisho,p of Paris visited him a short timebefore his death. The Court is much annoyed thatso staunchand public a partisan of the Emperor should have commanded so remark. able a deviation from the usual practice, and forbidden the observances which, except in very rare instances, are adhered to. The incident is much talked of. The body was borne from the residence of the deceased, in the Rue St. Lazare, to the Cemetery of are la Chaise. M. Yieillard's brother, Adjutant at the Palace of Compibgne, acted as chief mourner, accompanied by M. Boyer, of theImperial navy, and M.Reynaud, his nephews. The Emperor's household was represented by M. de Chaumont-Quetry, Chaiberlain; M. de Mocquart, the Emperor's private aecretary; and Dr. Conneau, his chiefphysician. The Minister of State and the Prefect of Police also attended. The Minister of Justice, who was detained at Fontainebleau, was represented by his son, M. Charlea Abbatucci, Master of Requests to the Council of State. The deputation from the Senate was composed of MM. Elie de Beaumont, Gauthier Leverrier, Goulhot de St. Germain, Admiral Hugon, the Marquis de Lawcestein, Count Lauriston, and M.Boulay, de la Meurthe. The Corps Legislatif, the Council of State, the Institute, the political press, and the various Ministerial depart. 3nentswerefullyrepresented. TheDukedePlaisance, General Grouchy, Generals Piat, de Casabianca, Larabit, Lacrosse, the Marquis d'Audiffret, General Courtais Petitet, Councillor of State, the Abb6 Glayze Volowski, General Foucher, and MM. de Thorigny, de Tocqueville, Taschereau, Mesonan, Gouin, Greterin, Cuvilier, Fleury, and Havin, of the SiUele, were present. The funeral cortge was escorted by a battalion of infantry of the line. M. Boulay, de la Meurthe, Senator, pronounced a speech at the tomb of the deceased. The funeral of the Marquis de Pastoret, Senator, and Member of the Academy of Beaux Arts, also took place to-day at the Church of the Madeleine. The Marquis Duplessis-Belliere, the deceased's sonin-law, acted as chief mourner, with the Barons Eazan and de Vaufreland, his nephews. The Emperor was represented by a chamberlain, and the Senate sent a deputation. After the religious service the remains of the deceased were provisionally deposited in a vrault, whence they are to be conveyed to the Castle of Fleury-sous-Meudon to be interred in the family bnrialplace. The Marquis de Pastoret was one of the few of the Legitimist aristocracy who took office under the present Empire. The following article, from the Sidoe, on the ap proaching elections, is meant as a reply to the Uniosi and the Gazette de France, the advocates of " abstention." It does much credit to the Sicle, and is, moreover, remarkable as having produced some sensation in the faubourgs-a sensation which is quite new for them now. The article has been eagerly sought after, and is read wvith much attention. It is to this effect:- " With the reserve becoming a serious journal we have advised our politioal friends to make use of their rights I and to take part in the elections for the Legislative Body; we have the satisfaction to learn that our advice has been well received, and that our views coincide with those of the most advanced as of the most moderate men of the great party of the French Revolution. The Liberal party thus offers a good and worthy example in laying aside dissenSions and differences of opinion in order to present itself united at the poll. We are, perhaps, justified in ex. pressing astonishment at the tone of irony, bordering on impertinence, employed by the Legitimists towards the SRe. Let them abstain from voting if they choose; let them obey the orders of the head of their party, and say that a sentiment of duty inspires them; to this we have no objeotionWe have never meddled in their family affairs. Moreover' democracy has never understood the duties of a citizen in the same light as the Legitimist aristocracy. This is easily explatned; the Legitimists are, above al, the ser. vants of a man, while we only obey principles that constitute the force and honour of our party. - We have not the presumption to impose candidates, bua those adopted by our friends will be supported by us with all our power and to the extent of our liberty. All Liberal France, which extends from the middling classes to the most obscure ranks of workmen-all that grand democratic family which accepted the Revolution of 1789, and which claims the prudent, moderate application of the principles prclaimed at that epoch, will take part in the elections. Doubtless, the D(taa.s, the Presse, the Rstafett4 the Siicl, and the various provincial journals which follow the same policy, do not possess the authority of the Legitimist journals; they have on their side the quantity of readers, while the quality is eertainly on the side of the ' ancien r?*imc.' But in times of universal suffrage quantity is not to be despised. We have regretted that the interpretation given to the electoral law should not be more extended; but this is not a reason why we should desert the electoral battlefield. Fortified by the approbation of the most eminent men of the democratic cause, we shall do all that is possible, within the limits of the law, to advance the election of our candidates. We do not resemble the Legiti. mists; our frame of mind is on a parity with our fortunes. We do not say that we shall gain numerous victories; but if we sustain a defeat we shall derive consolation from the reflection of having performed our duty, and of having fought loyally and with patriotismn for our cause." Prince Napoleon returned to Paris at 9 o'clock last evening from his journey to Germany. The ball to be given by the city of Paris to the REng of Bavaria is to take place on Thursday next. The Presse announces that the Conference on the Neuchhtel question is to meet to-morrow, in order to take cognizance of the instructions received by M. de Hatzfeldt, which authorize him to sign the protocol drawn up by the Conference. A violent thunderstorm burst over Paris yesterday afternoon about 5 o'clock, and was accompanied with such unusually heavy rain that for some time it seemed as if a waterspout had sent down its contents. In many places the streets were flooded, and for some minutes all passage was impossible. The early part of the day had been oppressively warm, with the glass at variable," so that the storm was I not altogether unexpected. The heavy rain fell for about half an hour, the rest of the evening being delightfully cool and agreeable, though with the sky somewhat overcast. The receipts of the Panis and Orleans Railway Company for the week ending the 13th of May amount to 1,169,177f. 63c., being an increase of 209,978f. 83c., as compared with the corresponding week of last year.

SATuItAY, MAY 23, 6 Pm. The Monitetw de la Flotte publishes accounts from China of the 2d of April, which contain some in. teresting details from the seat of war. Yeh, the Viceroy of the soulthern provinces of the empire, is at present at Son-Tehe-Ting, a large village of Kouang-Tcheou, about 15 miles from Canton. He aa fortified himself in a good position, which allows him to maintain his communications with Pekin and with the other three provinces which, with the Kouang-Tcheou, form his viceroyalty, and which are the Kouang-Si, the Kouang-Toung, and the Konei-Lin. He is at present at the head of an army of 30,000 men which he is increasiur every day by means of forced levies and extraordinary taxes. A few days previously it became known at Hongkong that a British ensign, two non-commissioned officers, some soldiers, and a few seamen, who had been taken prisoners by surprise on various occasions, were at Yeh's headquarters, where they were suffering great distress. It was resolved to open negotiations to obtain an excbange of prisoners in their favour, and a foreign agent, who had formerly had an interview with Yeh, undertook to manage the affair. Yeh consented to receive him, and, having listened to his propositions, he replied,- " You ask me to exchange the English I have in my pos. session, to the number of 16, against double the number of Chinese subjects, among whom are several Tartar officers and one of the commanders of the Imperial junks. I refuse. I do not want your prisoners, and you may do as you please with them, but if you are desirous to have the 16 Englishmen, and If you have the necessary means to treat for them I will let you knowr my intentions tomorrow." The foreigner who acted as agent between the parties remained at the Chinese camp, where he was tolerably well treated, and at 12 o'clock the next day he received a visit from Sinoo, the first aide-de-camp of Yeh, who is said to be devotedly attached to his master, and who told him that the Viceroy, having taken his proposal into consideration, would release the prisoners on condition that he was paid 500 piastres each for them. Sinoo added hypocritically that he advised him to accept the conditions, as the Chinese soldiers, notwithstanding all the care he took to restrain their brutality, were capable of offering the utmost violence, The agent referred to Hongkong, the money was immediately sent, and the prisoners were released without injury. It was subsequently discoveredthat Yeh had fixed the ransom at 400 piastres for each prisoner, but that Sinoo had increased it in order to keep a portion for himself. Such is the detestably covetous character of the Chinese functionaries. An unpleasant affair had occurred at Foo-chowFoo, a port on the river Mn, the principal market for black tea. The Viceroy having heard that, con- 1 trary to his commands, a considerable amount of business was transacted there, sent a company of his guards there on a market-day, arrested several Chinese merchants,and burnta considerablequantity of merchandise belonging to the English. At Shanghai there was much business doing. The Mandarin who governs there is completely opposed to Yeh, and has never ceased to be on the best termrs with foreigners and to protect their trade. The Imperial Government is compelled to tolerate him lest he should make common cause with the insurgents who are at his gates. The D8ba, in an article on free trade, contains the following passage:- " If there exists a country that ought to abstain from indulging in insults and insinuations towards England, to which we bear witness, it is perhaps France. ' Perfide Albion,' without demanding anything from us in return, ha3 opened her ports to our prodace of all kinds. We findin her an excellent market. Our flag participates inher trade and in that of her colonies on a footing of equaity. Iteven takes part in her coasting trade. The noisiest manufacturer who is the loudest assailant of England profits by this iberal legislation, and sends masses of his produce to that country. In 1842, that is at the commencement of the reform, Francoe, according to French documents, exported to England goods to the value of 92,000,000f., of which 49,000,000f. were in manufactured objects. In 1855 it exported to the value of 251,000,000f., in which mnufactured goods were represented by 187,000,000f." The following private telegraphic despatch has been received "TURIN, WAY 23.

"Te(rovicesro ofwth Ausoin epreNq,)wihcoti VIEbNA, MAY 20, Not long since cursory mention was made in my correspondence of a speech which on the 9th inst. was addressed to the members of the Austrian Agricultural Society by the Chevalier von Kiveyle, one of the counsellors of the Minister of Finance. The speech contains a vast deal of statistical information. I extract the following:- "The provinces of the Austrian empire, which ontain about 100,000,000 'acres' (ich) of productive soil, may be divided into four groups:-1. The alpne countries, which consst of Upper annd Lower Austria, Salzburg, the Tyrol. Corniola, Cnarinthia, and Styro. 2. The eastern countries, comprehending Hungary, the Banat, Croatia, ScLAvonla, the military frontiers, and Transylvaoia. 3. The northern countries,-which include Moravia, Bohemia, Galliola, and the Bukowina. 4. The southern countries, namely,i Lombardy, Venice, and Dalmatia. Of thel17,000,0003acres of productive soil wshich fall to the share of the Alpine countries, 11,000,000 are covered with forests. The remaining 6,000,000 are arable land and pastures. The attention of the inhabitants of the Alpine countries is pawrticullarly directed to the improvement of their forests and to the breeding of cattle, and it is but natural that such should be the case, as the land on which wood and grass are now grown oould not advantageously be used for any other agricultural purpose. The com and cattle prodaced In the Alpine ountries do not suffice for the necessities of their inhabiants. The eastern countries contain 47,000,000 aores of productive soi, 15,000,000 acres of which are covered with forests. Only 7,000,000 acres of land are ploughed, but corn might advantageously be grown on a great part of the soil on whioh hormed cattle, sheep, and horses now graze. The countries in question produce 105,000,000 metzen* of corn, out of the 260,000,000 which are grown in the whole empire. The weight of the wool grown in the eastern countries in the year 1851 was 260,000Ocw Vast numbers of swine are also bred and fattened in Hungary, and the average quantity of wine produced in that fertile Crown land is 30,000,000 barrels per anum. The quantity of tobacco grown in Hungary during the last year was about 600,000owt. The northern countries do not produce enough corn to supply the wants of their inhabitants, although a large proportion of tho land is ploughed and sown. The article of food on which the lower classes principally depend is the potato. A great part of the fine wool exported froma Anstria to England and France is grown in the northern countries, which have 26,000,000 acres of productive soil. About 16,000,000 acres are arable and meadow land; the other 10,000,000 acres are forests and commons. The southern countries have 9,000,000 acrea of productive soil 2,400,000 ace of which are pasture land. The extent of the forests is 1,500,000 acres. The provinoes of Lombardy and eVenioe produce 980,000Owt. of cheese, which is not quite half the quantity that is annually consumed in the empire 7,000,000 barrels of wine are made, if the oidiua does not make Its appearance, and 447,000cwt. of cocoons ProdUcQdif no epidemic decimatsB the silkworms. Tho contents of tho common sewrers of oilan render the meadows in the neighbourhood of that oity so wonderfully fertile that thoyaremowed no fewer than nin times in a year. The cows in Lombardy are imported from Switzerland. ia Dalmatia, where the soil is rocky, bat little corn is grown, and there is not more than 1,250 000 acres of pasture land." What was said a few days ago respecting the depreciation of house property in Pesth will also apply to the capital of Bohemia. Credible correspondents write from Prague that houses are continualy sold "for a mere song," and sometimes much below the price for wvhich they were mortgaged a few years ago. Last week a house in the city, which brought in a rent of 5001., was sold for 3,8001., and a large house on the Hradschin, which had been mortgaged for 5,4001., was sold by auction for 3,2001. A brewhouse with a front into two streets, which had always been valued at 10,0001., only fetched 5,8001. when brought into the market. Yn my opinion there are three reasons for this terrible depreciation of house property. ]. Many persons have speculated beyond their means in Credit Bank shares and railroad scrip, and are obliged to dispose of their real property m order to be able to meet their obligations. 2. House property rarely or never brings in more than 4J or 5 per cent., and a mn in business can now easily make 10 or 15 per cent. of his money. 3. The taxes on houses amount to 33i per cent. By an Imperial ordinance of May the 10th all those persons in Hungary, Croatia, Sclavonia, Transylvania, and in the Temesch Banat and Servian Voivodina , who are in receipt of an income of less than 300 forins (301.), are exempted from the income-tax. The persons who signed the petition which the Primate of Hungary presented to the Emperor a few days ago pledged themselves to keep the whole matter secret, but it has transpired that Prince Esterhazy, Prince Batthyani, Baron Sma, and a fourth magnate, refused to put their names to it. Although His Majesty made such great concessions to the Roman Catholic Church in order to secure the support of its servants, all the Hungarian bishops signed the address. The contents of the petition were privatelymadeknown to the Archduke Governor-General before it was presented to the Emperor, who is said to have returned it at onca to the Primate, with the words-" This is not a time for such matters," or "I have no time for such matters." At a sitting held a day or two since by the Directors of the National Bank some of them reproached Baron von Pipitz, the Governor of the Bank-who is a Government employe-with undue interference in the business of that institution. According to the statutes the directors ought t) examine the accounts of the cashiers, but the Governor undertook to do it. If the self-assumed duty had been properly discharged M. Reiter, one of thcashiers, would of course have had no opportunity of embezzling property to the amount of 350,OOfl. or 360,000fl, As has repeatedly been said, it is one of the weaknesses of the Austrian Government to meddle too much in the private affairs of the establihments which are under its protection. It cannot be doubted that a supreme control is necessary, but Austrian Ministers-and more particularly that enlightened statesman Baron Bruck-are greatly inclined to make mere puppets of the directors of the various joint-stock companies. In consequence of thenumberof English machines which were purchased at the Agricultural Exhibition the price of silver has rrsen 1 per cent. Eighty rooms have been taken at Marienbad, in Bohemia, for the King and Queen of Prussia and their suite. The apartments are engaged from the middle of June. PRUSSIA. (FmoX OUR OWN COBRYPONDET.) BERLIN, MA&Y 2L Her Majesty's message to the Houses of Parliament, announcing the approaching marriage of the Princess Royal with Prince Frederick William of Prussia, involving as it does a call upon them to make proper provision for her dowry, will probably give rise to some curiosity as to the provision made in Prussia itself for supporting the dignity of the Crown and Royal Family. The few data that I can offer to your readers on this subject are necessarily incomplete, but I hardly think that any of them are very far wrong. The Civil List in Prussia, or, to speak more properly, the claim entailed on the public domains for the support of the Crown, is 2,573,099 thalers, or 385,9651. This amount is, as its name implies (Kron flidei-comrniss), not the result of an annual vote of the Ohambers, but a fixed sum entailed on the produce of the Crown and State domains, in virtue of an arrangement made by the late Kingi in 1820, who caused an amalgamation of the Crown and State domains under one management; and at that time the above-mentioned sum was fixed upon as a fit and proper amount for the Monarch to derive from the common fund for the support of the dignitv of the Crown. Since then the value of money has considerably decreased in Prussia, as elsewhere, wbile, at the same time, the demands on the head of the State are continually increasing, so that it may confidently be looked forward to that in a few years the King will be obliged to make some alteration, either by precluding a great number of claims that are at present made on him, or by applying to the Diet for an improved arrangement. At the commencement of the session before last it was whispered that His Majesty contemplated a step of this kind, but nothing of the sort was brought forward; the plan, howe-xer, that was then conceived was to change the entail of the fixed sum into an entail of the landed property at present producing that sum, from which the King, well knowing the present mismanagement of the Woods and Forests, reckoned on deriving a much larger income under his own management. For various reasons, however, the plan has been nipped in the bud. In addition to the amount of two millions and a half of thalers settled on the public domains, the King is possessed of considerable private property, though more considerable in extent, perhaps, than in produce. It consists of 14 different estates in the provinces of Brandenburg, Saxony, and Silesia, which belong to him as the head of the Royal Rouse, and are distinguished by the name yaicifidei-commiss-giiter. There is, further, his share of the property left to the Royal Family by the late King, to be divided equally among all his children, the Familien-fidei-commiss-qiter; the value of these is reported to haveamounted to 10,000,000 thalers. And, thirdly, there are the estates which the Kina has purchased with his own means, the chatiUe' giiter, the produce of which more especially forms the privy purse, in the most unrestricted sense of the word; they consist of five rather small estate', and produce about 350,000 thalers a-year. What the total of all this may be I have no means of stating, as the rental of the Haus-Jdommiss-giuter is unknown to me, as well as the amount of the King's share of the FamiUen,fideicommiss-giier, aad it is even doubtful whether the King draws his share of the latter at alL Out of these apparently large sums the King provides a considerable money allowance for all the Princes and Princesses of the Royal House, in addition to defraying the expenses of a number of institutions and establishments which with us would either be in the hands of the State or of private persons. The amount spent in charity or for benevolent objects generally comes out of the privy purse; the allowances to the Royal Family and the maintenance of the household (which in its various ramifications numbers between 900 and 1,000 persons) are defrayed out of the general fund accrning from the abovementioned sources. The King is also in receipt of a further sum of 350,000 thalers (52,0001.), placed at his disposal by the State, with which he defays the innumerable claims upon him for building or enlarging churches and schools, for assisting artists and encouragiug art and science by the purchase of works of art, and for furthering enterprises of general utility over and above what the various public offices do in this respectofficially. By this arrangement tbe King is enabled to do a great deal of good in a field of benevolence for which his personal talents peculiarly qualify him; and it will not surprise your readers when I add that, with his readiness and liberality in giving, neither the 350,000 thalers (called the Disposition Fund) nor his own revenues suffice to meet his requirements The King and Queen are perfectly simple in their own tastes, habits, and wants, and constantly deprive themselves of a number of personal gratifications that they may be enabled to satisfy the many presing claims made upon them. The money allowance made to each of the Royal Princes (called here aanage) is 80,000 thalers a year, or 12,0001.; to each of their children, or to the cousns f te Kng, he alf or40,00 ;w rethe young Princes or Princesses have not as yet formed their household they only draw half of the sum they eventually receive on commencing housekeep. ing. Whether the Royal Princes, in addition to their apawage, also receive any salaie3 in virtue of their military rank or other post they may fnfl, I am not aware. Tho Prince of Prussia, as heir presumptive, I believe is in receipt of half as much again as his brothers Carl and Albrecht, and, like them, also draws his share of the Familien-fidei-commsiss estates; in addition to which, he has some private estates of his own. Besides the numerous expenses which the Royal purse has to defray in Prussia, and which your readers will readily sum up under the heads of household, palaces (27 in number), gardens, and stables (with 400 horses and 360 carriages), there are others that we are not accustomed to in England, such, for instance, as the subvention to the two Royal Theatres. All the actors and singers at these two houses are really and literally the King's servants, and must play and sing for him whenever he requires them. When this occurs at any other place than the theatres and opera-house, of course the public gets no dramatic or operatic entertainment that evening; the deficiency, therefore, between the cost of the theatres and their receipts must be defrayed by the King, and forms the amount of the subvention-about 150,000 thalers. There is then a further regulation in Prussia, that no officer in the army can marry without the King's consent This consent is never withheld if the intended couple have income enough, including the husband's pay, to live upon; but, if the pay and the private means together do not make up an income of 1,000 thalers a-year (1501.), the consent is withheld. This apparently rigorous law, however, converts itelf practically into a claim upon the King, on the part of all those officers desirous of marrying girls without propertv, to bestow on them a voluntary allowance sufficient to make up their pay to the necesary limit. As the pay of a Second Lieutenant is about 301. a-year, and that of a First Lieutenant 451., it may swel be believed that the making up this sun to 1501. in a good many instances is a rather onerous charge on the Royal funds. This in one instance of the paternal relationship kept up between the King and his officers; another is the allowance that he makes to them towards the expenses of their mess, and in some regnments towards the cost of their uniforms. Another very peculiar source of Royal expense arises out of the Queen's being patroness of all the Stijfer (reegious houses or foundations) throughout the kingdom. For every single presentation that may sooner or later become vacant to these refuges for aristocratic poverty there are always at least 100 lay nuns of noble birth consuming the tedious years that intervene between nomination and fruition in lingering expectancy; to each and all of these fair aspirants the Queen contrives to convey some crumbs of pecuniary comfort, to prevent the hungry souls from starving ere the long looked for presentation to the stift can fall in. As the chief activity and happiness of the Queen consist in promoting works of charity, religion, and benevolence-a pastime of a peculiarly expensive kindit may easily be imagined that this collateral claim on the Royal purse is also far from being a trifle.

Lu the Congress to-day the interestwasconcentrated on the Senate, whose doors were besieged before and after their opening by crowds of persons eager to get adDiittaI ce. There was a very full attendance of Senators, the galleries were thronged, and the atmosphere was suffocating, forte-day is the first summner day. The early part of the discussion was of no greatinterest. It related to General San Miguers amendment on the address. At last a Senator gave up his turn of speaking to General O'Donnell, who forthwith rose, and instantly aU were hushed in eager expectation. He said that he proposed addressing a few questions toNarvaez,and proceeded at once to do so, asking him if he had been associated with him since 1852, if he was cognizant of and ready to second the plans that O'DonneU carried out by his military insurrection in 1854-leagued, in short, with him (O'Donnell) in the affair ? Narvaez replied that he had not taken any part in these plans and movemente, but did not say that he had not been cognizant of them-rather eluded, in short, that part of the question. He then said that he took that opportunity of offering some explanations with regard to the word desmanes, which he had used in his speech on Saturday, and proceeded to softenit down, saying that it had been interpreted in a different sense from that he intended, and that he was ready to withdraw it, his intention not being to wound. O'Donnell then thanked the Duke of Valencia for his defence of him on Saturday, adding that he had done it as if he had defended his own cause. HLe then entered with much energy and heat into a narrative of events and their causes previously to the Revolution of 1854, and spoke of various persons compromisedwith him, amongwhom, he said, was Narvaez. Finally, he spoke of the address to the Crown disapprovmg some portions of it, and protesting against the Miras loan. Narvaez again rose and expressed his regret that the discussion should have become personaL He gave a sketch of his opposition to the Bravo Murillo Government and of his friendship with O'Donnell, and terminated by declaring his participation in the plans of the latter, and his motives for not taking an active part in the events of 1854. O'Donnell made an explanation, and confirmed what he had already said respecting the participation of Narvaez. The Senate rose very late, and I am therefore prevented from giving you to-day any better sketch than this hasty one of an extremely interesting debate. The Three per Cents. were done at 40 5; the Deferred, 25 80 ; Redeemable Debt, 1st class, 1160; ditto, 2d class, 6 65. MAY 19. It is unnecessary that I should trouble you with a long analysis of yesterday's debate in the Senate in orderto give a clear idea of its tenour and effect. I General O'Donnell had two objects in view-to vindicate his own political conduct aud to impugn that of Narvaez. In the former he totally failed, succeeding only in strengthening the general conviction that, as a politician, he is a weathercock and timeserver on whom no reliance can be placed. In his attack on Narvaez he endeavoured to prove that that General had entirely agreedwith him as to the propriety of the military insurrection of 1854. To prove this every means appeared good to the Count of Lucena; delicacy was cast to the winds, and the most private conversations were raked up and revealed. It must be borne in mind that the two Generals had been for many years, up to 1854, on the most intimate and friendly terms, and it will be easily understood that the friends being now enemies the debate assumed a most personal and bitter character, so much so that I last night heard the conjecture hazarded by more than one person that it might lead to a dueL, Tbis, however, is not likelv, although there is no saying to what lengths O'Donnell's intemperate and violent character may lead him, and what may pass in the Senate to-day, where the debate is to continue. He was evidently stung to the quick by some hard hits inilicted upon him by his quondam friend and present antagonist. Although he had had abundant tune -which he is well known to have availed himself of -to prepare his speech, and although Narvaez, not knowing what ho proposed saying, could have done but little in the way of preparing his reply, the advantage of argument and oratory was decidedly on the side of the Duke of Valencia, who kept his temper and spoke well and coolly, whereas O'Donnell was in a state of supernatural excitement and irritation. Narvaez made an ingenious and plausible defence. He admitted having expressed himself in 1854 to the effect that things had come to such a pass that a revolution was inevitable, and that he was willing to take part in it, but he added that he had never agreed to league himself with his political adversaries, the Progrestas, and that when. he found O'Donnell proposed doing so he desisted and withdrew. He explained the off'ensive expression he used in his speech of the 16th by saying that he had not limited his blame or imputed abuse (desmanes) to one or more particular Cabinets, but that he included all, his own Government among the number, for all had made mistakes and committed faults. His object, he added, was to place all on an equal footing, and so0 to open thle doo]: to recononwhatiQ3u and to ' The AusDan " metzen" is considerably larger than the English bushel. I oblivion of the past . It is generaly thxought a pity that the dussuon should hv a place at all, and O'Donnell is blamed for brin mng it on. It was a scmadalous and unseeZ spectacle to see two men of high lPOsitiOn-one the Prime Minister, the other an ex-Prime Minsier, ald both Field-Marhals-desending to personal recri_ miinations before the Senate and before the country But, if we ask the question, which of the two calne least scatbed from the encounter, the answer must be Narvaez. O'Donnell has placed himself further off than ever from office, and that is so strongly felt that it would not be surprising if some of his sCanty band of Vicalvanst partisans were to drop off from their adherence to his side. He has placed himself in a bad position at the Palace, for the Queen, it is well known, has been endeavouring for some time past to avert the threatened oontest which yesterday shook the floor of the Senate-house. We shaU see what passes to-day. General Serrano, among a number of other Generals and Senators, is expected to speak. As yet the honours of the debate have been for General Calonge, for the simplo but strong reason that his cause was good. He protested against the unscrupulous political intermeddHing and intriguing which constitute the sole occupation of Imany Spanish Generals; he denounced in the name of discipline the military insurrection of 1854, and demanded the punishment of its chiefs and istgators. Narvaez defended the insurrection, and avowed that it was only in consequence of collateral political considerations that he did not play a part mit. O'Donnell made a painful display of violence, inconsistency, and want of principle, and proved that his undesirable reputation is not usurped. After the debate Cantero and Collado, two exFinance Ministers, went up to him to congratulate him on his performance; it was remarked that neither of the Vicalvarist Generals Serrano and Ros de Olano did the same. What with the vehement personalities and strong interest of the discussion in the Senate, what with the bull-fight, which always stirs and heats Spanish blood (and that of yesterday was a go one six bulls and 17 horses having been despatched to Elysean pastures), what with the sudden heat of the weather and the electricity with which the atmosphere was charged, the clubs and cafrs of Madrid were last night in a state of prodigious excitement. The resucitation of past events, which were vividly recapitulated and exposed bythe rival Generals aroused dormant political pasion;, renswed old hostilities, and reopened wounds that were well nigh closed. People began to skirmish and squabble before the soup was of the table, and loud were the voices, energetic the words, and keen the sarcasms that resounded on all sides. To-day I hear of sundry anticipated duels, including a triangular one; but such encounters are not often of avery serious character in Spain, and bloodletting is by no means their invariable concomitant. People who are very prompt in quarrelare sometimes very prudent in fight. The Three per Cents, were done at 40C; ditto, Deferred, 25.85; Redeemable Debt, first class, 11.65.
EQUALIZATION OF THE POO-EATES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Slr,-The lighttbrowunponthisimportantsubject by the various leaders and letters that have appeared in the columns of The Times is rapidly diffusing itself throughout the metropolis. Boards of guardians and parochial vestries are now agitating the question in almost every direction, and the injustice of the present mode of levying rates for the support of the metropolian poor is a fact admittea on every hand. Every one aclnowledges that the law must be an unair one which compels one dock company to pay 20,000L a-year poor-rate, and another dock company, its next door neigh. bour, employing the same labourers almost to the same ex tent, and creating almost as large an amount of pauperism, to pay only a few hundreds for the same purpose. All acknowledge that it is unfair for the Apothecaries'-haU to ay four times as much and lc Timc-office three times as much as the Bank of England pays. No one does or can deny that it is wrong for St. Nilcholas Olave to pay 8s. in the pound, and St. Mildred, Bread-street, separated from it only by a narrow lane, to pay no rate whatever for the support of the poor. All admitit is iniquitous that one city rector should have to contribute 70L. a-year to the poor-rate and another nothing at all. One opinion only exists upon the impropriety of throwing upon the ratepayers of Woolwich the burden of supporting the -',000 hands that have recently been discharged from employment by tho Government, after having been collected from every part of England for the defence of the nation. While all are agreed upon the unfair operation of the present law, from the Bishop of London, who presented the petition of the east-end clergy, representing 370,000 people, to the House of lords on Monday, to the poorest ratepayer in White. chapel, yet the mode of remedying the inequality is still a question difficult of solution. Ono recommends a rate-inaid; another votes for a large scheme of emigration; another for a general rate of equal amount over the whole metropolis; anothor for an equal rate in each union; one is for local management, another for centralized authority. But the fear is that this diversity of opinions as to the remedy will tend to conceal from view the magnitude o the evil to be remediod; that the tiger will be upon the hunter before he decides whether to fre at him with slugs or bullet. A remarkable statement was made at the meeting of the Limehouse ratepayers on Wednesday, and repeated at the Whitechapel meeting on Thursday, which it is exceedingly desirable that the public should be made acquainted with by means of your ubiquitous and influential columns. It shows the contrast between the ratespaidfouryears ago and those paid last year in the following unions:- Name of Union. Poor-rate, 1852.

Z8s1 This brief list-which might be enlarged very considerably by the addition of Lambeth, Fulham, Southwark, and other poor unions-showa in itself how gigantic the evil is, how rapidly it increases, and that it was no vain assertion that the present system, if unchecked, must inevitably result in the utter ruin of the property situated in the pauperized districts. To the ratepayers, then, the means of cure will not be a matter of much moment; they will hail with welcome the "rate-in-aid" or the "general equalization," or any other means which the wisdom of Parliament may suggest. The drowning man is nob particular as to the shape of the plank that saves him, nor will they object to the form of the remedy, provided it bo an effectual one. The motion for a select committee to consider the inequality will be made by Mr. Ayrton on Thursday next, the 28th inst, and it is not expected that any opposition will bo offered by the Government, for they are well aware that the subject requires investigation, and that a committee is the only efficacious tribunal before which it can take place. Should another winter elapse before any step be taken to provide a remedy the consequences will probably be such as all men wbo wish well to the poor of the metropolis, whether ratepayers or rate-receivers, will have cause deeply to deplore. This is the conscientious conviction of those who have taken up the question, and it is one which an enlightened Legislature cannot treat with indifference. When the leading men of London, such as the Marquis of Westminster, Lords Portman, Shaftesbury, and Grosvenor, the Bishop of the Diocess, Mesr Hanbury, Glyn, Ayrton, and others are united in thinklng immediate inquiryto be necesary, the movers in thiamatter feel assured that their case is in a fair way for dispassionate discussion; and they think that a plan can be devised to meet the difficulty which will neither interfere with local management, nor lead to that extravagance which has been so often spoken of as the inevitable concomitant of a metropolian rate.

THE UNITRD STATES. (FROM OUR OWN OQRmESPOxDENDT) NEW YO= MAY. 9. TheDallaClarendontreAtyseon, forthe present at least, to be laid upon the shelf, and the old (entral American questionB left where they were. -I,The rejection of the amendments made by the Setiate, in consequence of the necessity of securing t)ie auent of Honduram, throws the treaty over the time for the exchange of ratifications, and puts the whole question afloat again. The two Governments are It full liberty once more to discuss whether the sans5uloUW King of the Mosquitoes is a veritable monarch, in spite of his predilection for bad brandy; whether the Bay ilands are a dependency of Eonduras or of the more distant Beliz; and, behid allthm tquestions, whether Filibusterism shall pAss the control of the Isthmnus beyond the Spanish races It was well known in Washington tltat the old treaty was ratified, with the amendmento, by the personal exertions of Ir. Buchanan and his friends, in order that a difficult question ni ght be removed, and the new Administration relieved. The fall of this treaty has opened those questions anew. YOU can judge in Elurope as well as we here how far the change is likely to complicate relations between the two countries. I can only reiterate what I said in my last letter, that the personal relations between the British and American authorities here are of the most agreeable kind. Lord Napier has established himself on the best possible footing at Washington, and has at the same time won most excellent opinions from the outside public that controls action at Washington. The quarrel between the different claimantu to municipal power has lulled into temporary quiet. All parties having at length joined issue in a way that bids fair to have the question in dispute setted before competent tribunaLs, the public have ceased to care about the squabble, except as hoping that whichever way it may turn we may have a more efflicient administration. It is not forgotten that last year the yellow fever lay for nearly three months at our door, kept out only by the 'vigorous administration of the quarantine laws, and that there is fear that the danger will appear again this year. We have again had a cold and late spring, which isoften followed by a hot and pestilential summer. The mass of the taxpayers, therefore only pray for some government, no matter of which party, that will keep the streets clean, attend to the sewers, and take at least the ordinary precautions for warding off disease. With only moderate care Newr York can be efficiently protected againt any pestlence. They demand also a police force that shall not be used for party purposes, that shall be reasonably active in preventing garotting and robbery in the ordinary thoroughfares-that is, within reach of the business streets-at the hours when people are ordinarily in motion, and that may, except in unusual cases, be relied upon for the conservation of the public peace.. In all these matters New York is just now passing through the trantition state between provincialism and metropolitanism. Although in size, wealth, direction of opinion, and everything that makes up a metropolis, it is certainly entitled to lead in American affiair6, its institutions are lamentablyprovinciaL The present move may be regarded as the precursr of ethers that are sure to follow, designed to give it the semidespotic institutions which are inseparable from aJl densely packed metropolitan communnities. A wellorganized police, for instance, must be essentially despotic. The most that freedom can claim is that the institutions which it protects and which direct it are essentially free. We are enacting over again the story of London and Peel's Police Bill. The trial of Mrs. Cunningham " drags its slow length along ;" elongated as it is, it is shorter than most criminal prosecutions for many years back In this respect the presiding Justice deserves credit. The prosecution, it seems to me, havemade no case at all, and if the defence had rested at the close of the testimony for the Government I think the jury must have brought in an acquittal. They show that the relations between Mrs. Cunningham and Burdell are consistent with the idea of a marriage, that the murder was committed by a person acquainted with anatomy, that the first blows were probably struck by a tall person from behind, that the person who did it must have been a strong person-more than able to cope with Dr. Burdell, that the house was easy of access, thatthere were marks of boodon the staircase descendingto the door and on the outside of the hall-door, that the floors were filled with mortar so as to be impervious to sound and that, in fine, there was an unprobability that the mumder was committed by hIfrs. Cunningham, and a reasonable probability that it was comm itted by some person who escaped by the hall-door. It is scarcely probable, therefore, that the tirial will result in a convition. In expectation of this some of the journals are, in advance, indulging in tirades against the administration of criminal justice in New York. I must say that so far as my opportunities for observation go there is no truth in the charges. I think that sometimes, perhaps, the law leans too much towards the prisoner; but, on the whole, I believe that crime is punished as vigilantly in New York as in any city of its size and population. There must, of course, be a greAt many persons in so large a communitywho contrive to elude justice; but, generally, I think the authorities manage to control crime and criminals with remarkable vigour for a community with a defective police and a well-banded body like the rowdies and " shoulder-hitters." The press are also loud, and justly so, in their complaints against the prosecuting officer for the ferocity of his language against the prisoner. The mystery of the Newburg murder remains as insoluble as any demonstration of spiritualism. It is said that the points of resemblance between the deceased and the living Miss Bloome are not as clear as would appear from the testimony; but who it is that was killed, or why she was made away with, is yet unknown. One of the morning journals advances the idea that the whole thing was got up to show the uncertainty of circumstantial evidence, and thus affectthe jury in the Cunningham case ;but, unfortunately, this requires us to believe that the sister and friends of Miss Bloome were really deceived on the question of identity. The usual monthly returns from the Customhouse continue to show increase in the importations and in the export of specie, while the suDply is less than last year. The importations for the 10 months ending May 1 were $187,000,000, against $160,000,000 for the corresponding period in the last fiscal year; the exports of specie, $33,115,000, against $15,061,000 last year; and the receipts from California $30,555,000, against $34,287,W00 last year; and the total exports from New York, specie included, $102,221,000, against $80,642,000 last year.

LAW REPORT. COURT OF CHANCERY, LICOLN'S-INN, XAY 23. NUNN V. EDGE tHUefore the LORD UHANCELLUR.) t This was a part-heard appeal from a decree of Vjee. Chancellor Stuart, dismissing the plaietiff's bilL The suit ,was instituted informdpaupe?ris by Katy A,,iu Nunn, the widow of William Nunn, claiming the benefit of a bond alleged to have been executed by the late Uaptain Edges RNN., in the year 1805. The allegations in tt e bill were that previous to the exeoution of the bond Captain Edge seduced Peggy Nunn, the daughter of a respectablo yeoman, of Holbrook, in the county of Suffolk, bY whom he had an illegitimate chUd, William Nunn, the husband of the plain. tiff. In order to make provision for such child Captain Edge executed the bond in question, binding hianself, his heirs, executors, and administrators, to pay during the joint lives of hinmself and the said WilLiarn Nunn an annuity of 20L to Peggy Nunn and Charles Nunn, upon trust for the maintenance and education of the baid William Nunn during his infancy, and on his attainmuent of 21 in trust for the said Willam Nunn, and also to pay the sum of 5001. on the death of the said Captain Edge, upon trust, in case the said William Nunn shoutd have attained his age of 21 years, for the said William Nuann absolutely. WiUiam Xunn attained his age c *, 21 years in 1825, and in 1827 intermarried with the ;. -ntiff. Captain Edge died in 1842 leaving the defendauts William Edge and Michael Bentley executors of his will. Peggy Nunn died in the year 1847, and Charles Nunn, the other obligee of the alleged bond, in August, 1855. The bill then went on to state that the annuity of 201. was regularly paid bv Captain Edge d,wn to the time of his death. Shortly after the death of Captain Edge Michael Bentley inf,irwed William Nunn that Captain Edge had by his will left him an annuity of 20., and the first half-yearly payment was accordmngly made to him, but before a second payment became due William Nunn died, on the 6th of June, 1843. The bill next alleged that an acquaintance of the plaintiff in the year 1846 informed her that a bond, binding the executors of the late Captain Edge to pay the sum of 5001. to her late husband, had been executed by the said Captain Edge ; and in consequence of ihis information she proceeded to make inquiries, and, after long search, found the draught copy, as settled by co,insel, and a copy of the bond, asserted to have been executed by Captain Edge, in the possemsion of Mr. George Bower, of Tokenhouse.- yard, the successor of the solicitors with whom the bond had been deposited by the trustees thereof. No trace of the original bond bas ever been discovered, and upon application being made to Michael Bentley shortly after the finding of the two copies he on behalf of himself and his co-executor refused to make payment until the original bond should be prodaced. The bill then stated that the plaintiff, being utterly destitute, applied to the defendant, William Edge, for some temporary assistance, until he should satisfy himself of the truth of her statement respecting the bond, and through Michael Bentley was informed that a sum of 101. would be given to her in charity, although she was an impostor, provided she would sign a paper not to make any further claim upon the estate of Capt-in Edge. According to the allegation in the bill the plaintiff, being overwhelmed by the accusations of Michael Bentley, and in ignorance of the effect of the said paper, signed it, and took the 101. This occurred in 1846, and it was not untU the month of December, 1855, after the death of Charles Nunn, the survivor of the obligees of the alleged bond, that the bill was filed, praying to have the relemse executed by the plaintiff'declared invalid and void, on the ground that it had been obtained froin her by fraud, misrepresentation, and surprise, and to have it declared that the plaintiff was entitled to be paid what might be found due for principal and interest on the said bond. The question, being one of fact, of course depended entirely upon the evidence, which was very volumuinous, and the arguments uponi it occupied the attention of the Court the best part of three days. On behalf of the defendants the allegations of fraud respecting the release wvere not only negatived by their own witnesses, but the admiissions of the plaintiff herself in writing some time back altogether disproved the charge, and the Vice-Chancellor accordingly dismissed the bill without hearing the defendant's counsel. From this decisien the plaintiff appealed. Mr. MALINS and Mr. CARY, for the appellant, contended that there was ample evidence to show that a bond had been executed by Captain Edge, and, although the allegations of fraud might not have been substantiated, the fact of the plaintiff having, in ignorance and without professional ad. vice, taken 101. and signed a release ought not to prevent her recovering what was due upon the bond. Mr. BACON and Mir. A'PIILxr', in support of the dec.ee, urged that there was no proof of the existence of a bond at alL The two copies afforded no evidence that Captamn Edge actually executed any bond. Moreover, if he did execute one, the presumptiou was inevitable that it was cancelled in his lifetime with the concurrence of WilUiam Nonn. The claim wasa stale one, for, although the plaintiff at the time of her marriage, in 1827, knew that there was a talk about such a bond having been executed, she took no step to enforce any claim until nearly 30 years afterwards, when the surviving obligee of the supposed bond had just died, and every other person who could have given any evidence respecting it thad it ever been executed) had died long before. The plaintiff had not even thought fit to examine Mr Bower to show in what way he came possessed of the two copies. Mr. CARY, in the absence of Mr. Malins, replied, and remarked that it was as much the duty of the defendants to call Mr. Bower as it was that of the plaintiff. The LORD CHANCELLOR delivered judgmeslt, and said he entertained no doubt whatever on the case. No bond was forthcoming, but, although that fact was not conelusive that no bond had been executed, it rendered it imcumbent upon the ecstuilac trusts to produce very cogent evidence indeed to satisfy the Court thatt it ever had existence. What was the evidence in the present case ? The two idraughts which were produced from the solicitor's office. Now, although their production might furnish some evidence to go to a jury upon, it could amnont to nothing without an examination of Mr. Bower to show in what way the documents camue into his possession. Possibly he might have been able to explain that they were copies of an unexecuted instrument. At any rate, the non-production of Mr. Bower was a very suspicious circumstance; and it was plainly the duty of the plaintiff to have produced him, and not that of the defendants. In addition, the evidence was by no means conclusive as to the regular pavment by Captain Edge of the annuity, and therefore he (the Lord Chancellor) was not satisfied that a bond was ever executed. If, however, such a bond did ever exist, the presumption from the evidence was that it had been satisfied by the obligor. Is Was executed in the year 1805, and yet there was no evidence that it was ever iu the hands of either of the obligees, or that they took any steps to obtain possession of it. Curiously enough, one of the obligees liveil u,itil within a few months of the filing of the bilL After sueh a lapse of time since the making of the bond without any claim being founded upon it the Court could come to iio otber concelsion than that it had been long since satisfied. He did not therefore wonder at the Vice-ChanceUor in holding that there was no evidence to support the pilainitlifs claim, and could only say that he considered the conduct of Mr. J?atriek, the plainti{Ps solicitor, higisly reprehensible in wrtig the insolent letter he did before filing the bil and in persevering in the suit after its dismissal by the Court below. He must also Compnlain of the too great facility afforded to the institution of suits in form& pauperis, and, although it wouid be fruitless ats far as the defendants wero concerned, the appeal would be dismissed with costs. Mr. MALNLINS, with some warmth, said he must take his full share of his Lordship's censure respecti,lg the appeal, as his Lordship was aware that it could not have been prosecuted without his (Mr. Alalins's) sign;,ture. As had been stated by Lord Eldon, counsel could hardly hell) sanctioning an appeal when it was desired by the parties themllselves, and in the present case, considering the destitute condition of the plaintiff, and the sanguine view she took of her own case, he felt he could not do otherwise than give her the opportunity of having it reheard. Under these circamstances he trusted his Lordship would withdraw the censure he had cast upon the solicitor in the case. As to the advising of the suit his junior counsel was very young at the bar, and had, perhaps, been too enii isiastic as to the result of the case- a fault that a little experience would Soon cure. The LORD CHANCELLOR roplied that he did not blame Mr. Patrick so much for the a al as he did for writing tho letter he had alluded to. . Cary had roost ably done everything he could for hi; client's interest, and doubtless would when more experienced learn to look upon such cases as the present one in a less enthusiastic manner, SIrTLNGS OF THE COURT. The LoRD CHANCELLOR took occasioni to say that the full Court of Appeal would sit on Friday and Saturday next, and on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in the following week. (Before the LoRDs JuSTICES OF APPEAL) IN RE WOODBuRN's TlRUSt. Mr. SiA5IER informed their Lordshipis that the Lord Chancellor had stated that he should be at leisure on Friday and Saturday in next (this) week, and on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in the foUowing week, to sit in the full Court of Appeal, and to take such cases as the Lords Justices would please to appoint. EX PAItTE HARDING, IN RE GREIG. Their ILORD3SsPrS directed that this case should be mentioned to tho Lord Chancellor as one which it would be well to be heard before the full Court. EX PABTE BOYD, IN RE THiE ROYAnL BANK OF AUSTRALIA This was an appeal from a deoision of Vice-Chancellor Stuart, who had dismissed an a ppeal from a judgment of Master Richards, allowing the clim of Miss Marion Boyd and Miss Mary Boyd, as holders of four debentures of the Royal Bank of Australia, three for 5001. each and one for 2001. The claim arose in the following manner .-The late Mr. Boyd, the father of the ladies, in 1837 inpured his life in the United Kingdom Life Assurance-office, of which he was resident director, in the names of his sons, Benjamin and Mark Boyd, for the sum of 2,9991. 19s., " in trust for Miss Mrion Boyd, Mliss Mary Boyd, and Miss Joanna Stewart Boyd." The last-named lady died in her father's lifetime, and he regularly paid the premiums until his death in 1846. The company paid the amount due on the insurance, 1,7481. 4s. od., by cheek to Mr. MIark Boyd, one of the trustees, some material deductions being made. The trustees, who were the stockbrokers of the Royal Bank of Australia, laid out 1,7001. of the money in the purcheas of the four debentures in the names of their sisters, the purchase being dated November 4, 1846. On the 13th of March, 1857, Mr. Richards, acting in the u.7inding-up of the affairs of the bank, allowed the claim of the ladies as a debt against the bank for 1,7001. and for 2971.7s. 10d., the amount of the coupons attached to the debentures, From this order the official manager of the bank appealed to the Vice-Chancellor, who affirmed his decision with costs, and hence the present ap peal. i-: hIins and Mr. Roxhurghappeaed for the appellant; r. Rochfort Clarke (of the common law bar) vwas for some contribusoris in support of the appeal; -Mr. Bacon and Mr. Karslake supported the decision of the Vice-Chan- The arguments for the appeal weze shortly these :-That t 1,71. was a debt not from the hank, but from Mark oyd and his firm to the ladies: that the debentures had mever appeopriated to the isses Boyd, and if they ad been theO title of Mark Boyd to them was5 no good, for, as they were overdue the ladies rust take them subject to all thle equities effecti'ng them ; that it was not shown that the seses Bo d knew of any aleged appropriation until long after the debentuwreosf were overdue ; that Mark Boyd was himself a debtor to the bank in 15,0OOe. or more when he nade the aleged investment in the debentures; that, although there was an entry in the bank books speaking of a "Miss oyd" as owser of 2,0001. worth of debentures, that by no means " ear-marked" the fund, especiaL'y as the sum was different and the name of only one lady mentioned, whereas there were two interested, or alleged to be interested; that the fact of on'ries in the books of Benjamin and Mark Boyd were insufficient to show an appropriation; and ultimately that even if Boyd, the father, had affected to create a trust it was void, inasmuch as at the time of the settlement he was himsolf largely indebted to his son, I Mlark Boyd, and that therefore the 7,0001. received from the insurance-office belonged to the creditors of that son, and not to the ladies. The learned counsel asked that, instead of the demand being admitted as a debt, it should only be entered as a claim, and then that the question of title should be tried in an action against one of the contributories. Lord Justice KNIGHT BRtUCE said it appeared to him that it was a just inference from the evidence that the 1,700& was the money of the Misses Boyd, and that that very money was invested in the purchase of these very debentures. It did not appear that there was anything to impugn the genuineness of the entries in the books. Lord Justice TURERE said it appeared to him that the proper course would be that the money should be impounded-say, for three weeks or a month-in order to see whether a suit or action would be instituted against the ladies. Lord Justice KiaunT BRUCE.-The question really is whether the trust is established to have existed in 1846, and, if so, whether this Court thought there was a reasonable probability of obtaining further evidence against a twofold decision in their favour, On behalf of the Misses Boyd it was strenuously argued that to retain the money in court would be only to encourage useless litigation, for that there had been a very full examination upon oath, one of the witnesses being one of the two ladies. and another one of the brothers of Mr. Mark Boyd, neither of whom had the official manager of the bank or any of the contributories thought fit to crossexamine. Mr. KARSLAKE, in tho course of his argument, read passages from the judgment of Vice-Chancellor Staart, in one of which his hlonour said - *- The further this ca!e haai proceededthe more does it seem to me to be the very last sortof mae that oughttobeEeLt tohe triedbeforea jury. It is _ case of an equitAble right, accompanied with a complication of oquitable tiue. vrith the legal right conferred by tbo dehvery of the asignment. It might be a very proper thing if ther were doub:e, or suspicions sufficiently sanctioned by evidenco to create a doubt I,. the tnidoof the Court, to direct an iseue to try ny factsastowhich ttere was a doubt,-es for instance, the authenticity of these entries In the books of Mr. Mark Boyd as an honest record, and contemporaneowly made. of tho transactions purDorting to be recorded. A question of that kind might be sest to a jury, but to send this case, ugon the authority of Gwynne's case, or upon the authority of any other case, to be tzied by a jury, and leave the~e ladie-, who seem to .e to have suffered too muich already, to tLdergo the exense and hazard.-forthree issome hazard ina trial by jury,-ate, alithathas takentpiace woulld be to my mind one of the greatest oppre-sionu and acts of Injustice or which a court of justice could well be g uuty-an act vwhich I (mntertainineg tb at opinion ot ill shall keep^ esseslf clear of, and therefor ram gladto find that the decision of the at .ter is one free from ali doubt, saud my only reg,ret is thai I cannot reimburse these Mr. hIAx.rs having been heard in reply, Ldord Justice KNIGHT BRUC said the valiidity of the trust wFas only impugned on the ground of the insolvency of the father, but it was not shown upon the evidence that he was so. True, he was largely indebted to his son Mark Boyd, and that debt still remained. No doubt, there was no other debt, but Ddark Boyd, who was one of the persons constituted a trustee in 1837, recognized the trust, and from that time until his bankruptcy many years later had dealt with the money as trust money, and acted as a trustee. It was therefore quite impossible to recognlize any claim of M\ark Boyd as a creditor against his father's estate and in contravention of the trust. The tWO so11s, or one of them, wvere chargeable as trustees, or a trustee, with the sum of 1,7001. There was not any reasonable probability in his Lordslhip's opinion that now any evidence could be obtained to vary this state of things. The sons, or the son, laid out the money in the purch..se of dobenturesof theoRoyal Bank of Australia. with which Mr. Mdark Boyd was largely connected. The accuracy and genuineness of the entries in the books had not been questioned, and from those entries, and the remainder of the evidence, the inference was unavoidable that the money was specifically paid to the bank as the purchasemoney of certain debentures, which (or four of them) represented and were intended by btr. filark Boyd, the trustXee to represent the 1,7001. trustmoney. The factwas clearly andindisputablyesta. blished that MIark Boyd held the debentures as a trustee for his sisters, whether those ladies knewr the fact or not. The question! then, was whether there was any reason to believe that additional evidence could be obtained to vary the state of circumstances, and his Lordship was of opinion that there was no reasonable ground for so thinking. 3fark Boyd paid interest to his sisters regularly or irregularly, and upon mnoney which they considered held in trust f or them;and before the bankruptcy Edward Boyd, a brother, had de1iveredto him by Mark Boyd or his clerk the debentures in qWuestion as the property of the ladies. There was no question, there! ore, of orderand disposition. The creditors of MlarkBoyd and of the fatherwerealikeout ofthecsse. The onlyqnuestion was whether the fact Of Mark Boyd being largely indebted *'o the bank, the bank could ray that as Mark Boyd could not make a title to the debentures his sisters in like m anner could not. They could not so say, for the debentures were regularly bought in the due course of business, the money for them being paid to the bank. There w-as no reason here, again, to think that further evidence yould* alter the case. His Lordship was of opinion that there wvas no ground for the appeal, and be agreed with the Master and the Vice-Chancellor, wvhose united decisions be for one affirmed with costs. The case was perfectly clear-perfectly free from doubt. The official mana>ger would have reserved to him the right to take any steps ho might be advised for the recovery of the money. Lord Justico TURN-ER thought the order of the ViceChancellor was quite correct ard could not he disturbed, There had been a trust validly created, it had not been put an end to, and it was not now open to impeachmBent.
ROILLE COURT, CEABczRY-LA?NE, MALY 23. MIEREDITH V. VTflT (Before ahe MASER of the ROLLS.) His HONOUR gave judgment in this case, in which the question raised was whether certain real estate of the original testator in the cause, directed to be sold by trustees and converted into personalty, had been re-converted by a subsequent testator, in order that it might be ascertained whether the property in question passed to the testator's real or to his personal representatives. The Court decided in favour of the latter. Mr. R. Palmer, Mr. Lloyd, Mr. Selwyn, Mr. Nalder, Mr. E. Stevens, and Mr. Simpson appeared in the case.
VICE-CHANCELLORS' COURTS. Mtv 2- WILCOX V. SMIlP (Before Vice-Cha7 nceMwr Sir R. T. KTnD} RnSLEY.) This case came on upon a petitioa raising a very important question under the Succession DExty Act (16th and 17th Victoria, cap. 51). The facts were these :-A ntlman named Wfilcox made his will, dated on the 3d of June, 1826, devising his estates at Wolston, Brandon, and Stretton-upon-Dunsmore, in Warwiokshire, to trustees in trust for his son Wiliam Wilcox for life, with remainder to trustees to preserve, with remainder to his first and other Eons in tail male. In May, 1827, thetestator died, and Wiliam Wilcox became entitled to the property as tenant for life. WiUiam Wilcox died on the 15th of July, 1853, and his son Charles Walford Wilcox then became entitled as tenant in tail in possession. The statute in question received the Royal assent in August, 1853, bearing date on the 4th of that month, and the 2d section was as follows:!And be it enacted that everv past and future disposition of property by reason whereof any person has or shaU be. come beneficiaUy entitled to any property or the income thereof, upon the death of any person dying after the time appointed for the commencement of this Act., either immediately or after any interval, either certainly or contingently, and either originally or by way of substitutive limitation, and any devolution by law or any beneficial interest in property or the income thereof, upon the death of any person dying after the time appointed for the commencement of this Act, to any other person in possession or expectancy, shaU be deemed to have conferred or to confer on the person entitled by reason of any such diqposition or devolution, 'succession,' and the term 'successor' shaU denote the person so entitled, and the term ' predecessor' shall denote the settlor, disponer, teatator, obligor, ancestor, or other persons from whom the interest of the successor is or shaU be derived." The 15th section enacted that where at the time appointed for the commencement of the Act any reversionary property expectant on death should be vested by alienation or other derivative title in any person other than the person who should have been originally entitled thereto under any such disposition or devolution as was mentioned in the 2d section, then the person in whom the property should be so vested should he cbargeable with duty, in the same manner as a successor, would have been chargeable under that section, and also in the case of acceleration of succession. In the 14th, the 20th, and 44th sections the same words " become entitled" were used, and the 54th section runs thus :-"This Act sball be taken to have come into operation on the 19th of May, 1853, and shall take effect accordingly." Mr. Charles Walford Wilcox having become tenant in tail in possession on the 18th of July, 1853-that is, between the actual passing of the Act in the August following and the 19th of May preceding, to which day under the 54th section the Act was to have relation back, the question was whether his case came within the operation of the statute, and whether he was chargeable with succession duty. For the purpose of raising this question the Crown, by the Attorney-General, presented a petition for ascortainment and payment of the uty, which was resisted by Mr. Charles Walford Wilcox. The Attorney-General, Mr. Thring, and Mr. Elanson appeared for the Crown; Mr. Glasse and Mr. F. S. RZilly appeared for Mr. C. W. Wilcox, and opposed the petition. The ATroRNEY-Gx-ERAL, was heard in reply. TheVicE-CuANcRLLoR said that, although he entertained a strong opinion upon the question raised in this CeSe, he should like to have an opportunity of considering theo various sections of the Act before he gave his judgment upon it, which he would do in a very short time. (Before Vice-ChancUor &Sr W. P. WoOD.) GROSVENOR V. THE HAMPSTRAD JUNCTIoN RAILWAY COMPANY. Mr. WIULcocK and Mr. TORRsANo moved for an injunction to restrain the defendants from entering upon, taking pesesosion of, or otherwise intermeddling with a certain piece of ground and premises in Kentish-town, upon which the St. 'ancras abmshouses were in course of erection and from commencing or csrrying on any railway or other works in . or upon or affecting the said piece of laud ond premises, or any piart thereof. The plaintiffs, who were the trustees of a charitable society caUed the St. Pancras Aimbouses Instftution, had purchased from the Governesses Benevolent Iustitution cerain lands in Kentish. town for the prpose of buding lmahousee thereon. Certain conditions were contained in the contract of sale as to the erection of these almshouses, and the reservation of the central area as a garden or open space for the inmates The erection ot the alhlwuem was proceeded with subsequently to the purchase of the land, and the central portion of the line of building, comprising a hall, library, and coemitteeroom, with residences for married couples, was completed in 1854 On the 15th of July, 1851, notice was served upon the plaintiffs by the Hanipstead Junction Rail7way Company of their requirin for the purpose of their Act to purchase and take 10 perches of the Jand which had been conveyed to the plaintiffs by the Governesses Benevolent Institution. The plaintiffs thereupon required the company to take the whole or nono of the land conveyed to them, on the ground that the part required by the company was uortion of a continuous tenement, and that the railvwvy, by separating the central portion of the almshouses from the proposed side wing, would render the building urseless and destroy its character, so as to make it necessary for the plaintiffs to take a fresh siteoipon whiohlto re-erect the almshouses. Some negotiation had ensued, but, the parties having been unable to come to any agreement, the plaintiffs had in April last received notice of the intention of the company compulsorily to take the land comprised in their notice of July, 1854. The cantral portion of the almshouses already erected reached to witbin a foot of the proposed line of railway. The plaintiffs, upon receiving this notice, had filed their bill, and now moved for an injunction. In support of the motion it was contended that the chs. racter of the building would be completely destroyed if the railway comrpany were allowed to purchase this portion of the land without taking the whole, and that the side wing which it was proposed to cut through was such an integral portion of the building as to bring the case within sec. 92 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Acb (1845), which provides " that no party shall at any time be required to sel or convey to the promoters of the undertaking ap art only of any house or other building or manufactory, if such party be 'wing and able to sell and convey the whole thereof." hMr. ROLT and Mr. SPEED opposed the motion, and contended that the company did not proposo to touch with their railway any building in existence, or any luid actually enjoyed with any existing building. The portion already built formed distinct tenements, complete in themselves, and left untouched by the proposed line of railway, and It wonld be a most strained construction of see. 92 to hold that it applied to buildings in posse as wel as in eue. Could it be contended that if a railway across the Thames touched the lower corner of }ing's Bench-walk, the company would be compelled to take the whole of the Temple 2 Mr. WILLCOCK replied. The VICE.CHAXNC:ELLOR said that he would give judgment on Monday (this) morning.
COURT OF QU1EENS BENCH, WrSTBiNSTmi, BY 23. MNFRP.V V. R.ART.R1 An -Fo- t=M93 Sn ba?1co, beforc Lord CA3eBELL and Jutka COLERIDGE) WIGHTxi, and PB:tLE.) mr. H. HiLL moved, pursuant to leave reserved, for a rule to enter a nonsuit, or to enter a verdict for the defendants. The action was tried before Mr. Justice Wightrman, at the last sittings at Guildhall, when it was arranged that the plaintiff should have the verdict, subject to the opinion of the Court on the facts given in evidence. The question to be argued was whether the plaintiff wasentitled to recover the value of a quantity of hemp. which he had sold and delivered to a ropemaker at Sunderland, named Horne, who had become insolvent, and which the defendants, who were Horne's assignees, had taken possession of and sold. The plaintiffs case was that there had not been any acceptance of the goods by Horne; but the defendants' contention was that no acceptance was necessary to pass the property, but that if acceptance was necessary Home's con. duct amounted to an acceptance of the goods. Lord CAmPBELL said the learned counsel night take a rule to show cause. Rule nisi granted. TIE QUEEN V. THE TIVERTON BOARD OF HEALTIL In this case the Court had granted a mandamus to the Tiverton Board of Health, commauding them to put the burisiground provided by the Board in a fit and proper state for consecration by the Bishop of Exetcr. Mr. KLNGDON now moved for a rule, calling on the prosecutor to show cause why one of the pleas should not be disallowed. The mandamus recited, first, that the board had neglected to put the burialground in a fit and proper state for consecration; and, secondly, that the burialground did not appear to the bishop to be in a fit and proper state for consecration. To this the board had made a return, in which they alleged that the burialground was in a fit and proper state for consecration, but admitting that it did not appear to the bishop to be in such a state. To this return the prosecutor demurred, upon the ground that it did not deny but admitted that the burialground did not appear to the bishop to be in a fit and proper state for consecrationand he also pleaded that at the time, &c., the whole of the burialground was surrounded by a wall and gates, and that the portion to be consecrated was separated from the uneonsecrated portion by a wall 18 inches in height, and in other parts by banks, but that the bishop refusedto consecratothe ground because it was not properly fenced and divided from the unceonsecrated part, and that the bishop required a fence four feet in height and gates of the same height where gates were required. The learned counsel said he objected to the whole of this last plea, and contended that the whole question, whether the groumd was in a fit and proper state for consecration, was suliciently raised by the other issues. Lord CAMPBELL said it would be very desirable If the counsel on both sides could agree to put the substantial question on the record, but in case that could not be done the learned counsel might take a rule to show cause. Rule nisi granted. BOVILL V. EYOBTH AND ANOTEEB. This case was this day re-argued by one counsel on each side, on the construction of the plaintiffs patent for improvements in the manufacture of wheat and other grain into flour and meal, Mr. KNOWVL:ES, Q.C. (with whom were Mr. Bovill, Q.C., and the Hon. George Denman), was heard for the plaintiff ; and Mr. ATHERTON, Q.C. (with whom were Messrs. Manisty and Hindmarsh), for the defendants. Lord CAMPBELL, after thanking the counsel for their able assistance, said the Court would take time to consider. BIRCH V. JURY. This was an action in which the Liverpool and London Fire and LifeInsurance Company sought to recover damages from the defendant, James Jury, an auctioneer and surveyor in the city, for negligence in valuing certain property upon which the company had been induced to advance 7,5001. At the trial, which took place before Lord Campbell, at Guildhall, in February last the plaintiff obtained a verdict, with is. damages; hbut 3aubseqdently the Court granted a rule to show cause why there should not be a newv trial, on the ground that the verdict, if not perverse, was inconsistent. Sir F. Kelly, Mr. M. Smith, Q.C., and Mr. Hurrell now showed cause against the rule; and Sir F. Thesiger, Mfr. Bovill, Q.C., and Mr. Lush appeared to support it. Sir F. LHESIGER had not proceeded far in his argument, when Lord CA.?iPBELL said the verdict was not satisfactory. The rule for a new trial would therefore be made absolute, but on the payment of costs,

M'Intyre having been heard yesterday to show cause against the rtle. the question ivolved was as to the lability of underwnters on a time policy of sea insurance against total loss. e p in question, being in a leaky conditon, was bluiged to put into the port of Grimshy and unload her cargo of coas, Which waS so damaged with st water that it would have cost more than the coals cere worth to have washed them and reshipped them, there being d ineer of spontaneous combustion if they were reloaded without washing. The Lord Chief Juste directed the jury that this amounted to a total loss of freight, and they found for the plaintiff. The question was whether the underwriters were liable, there being no total loss of either ship or cargo, and whether this direction was right. There were other questions, whether the policy had excpired, or was a continuingrpoc, withoutnoece, andwhether, wher freight was not earned within the time of the duraton of the polcy by reason of the cerils insured against, it could be recovered on the policy. The COiRT were of opinion that the rule should be discharged, and that the direction of the Lord Chief Justice was right; and that if durng the continuan1ce of a time policy freight were lost from th perl insured against the mnsured was entitled to recover, although the freight might have been earned by an improvident and unreasonable outlay greater than the freight; for this, commercially speak.. ing, was atotal loss. Rule discharged.
COURT OF EXCEQ.UEP. SATImRnAV M%AV 9!R d UDGOMENS. GELEN V. BALL. (MiUing in Banco.) Xins was an action of trespass by a drover against a maRistrate for wrongfully imprisoning and also for maliciously convicting him on two occasions when cbares were preferred against him by the offncials of the Eastern Counties hallway Company at Ely for alleged, but unfounded, breaches of the ylaws of the company. At the trial before Lord Cain,beU at Cambridge that learned judge ruled that the first imprisonment was justfiable, but directed the nury to assess damages, with leave to enter a verdict for the plaintiff for the snm so asssed (201.) As to the conviotion and second imprisonment under it, which were alleged by the declaration to be malicious a verdict was found for the plaintiff for a large sum, incluaing the cost incurred by him in quashing the conviction. On this state of things the plaintiff obtained a rule to enter a verdict on the first count. while the defendant obtained another, as to the seoond count, for a new trial, on the ground that the fmding of the jury that the conviction was malicious was opposed to the evidence, and also in arrest of judgment, on the ground that the count disclosed no legal cause of action. Timg having been taken to consider both rules, The Clsnu~ BMSO2 now delivered judgment, discharlgng the rule of the plainUff, on thel grotmt that the defendant was protected by the statute 11th and 12th Victoria, cap. 4'3, and making that of the defendant absolute for a new trial, at the ae time declining to give any opinion "a to the validity of the second count, or the reasons for sendin the cause down for a now trial. Judgment accordingly. OLDERSHAW AND ATOTTEMR V. saG. This Wms an action on a guarantee given by the defendant for his uncle. The alleged liability of the defendant was founded on a letter to Mr. Olderehaw (whose execator. the plaintiffs are), in which, after dtating the existence of a debt to him from his uncle, and alluding to the toasibili future dealings, and an increase of the existing debt, the writer says,-" Iamrwillingto bear you harmless againstany loss arising out of the past and future transactions to a certain extent, and therefore, in consideration of your forbear. ing to press for the immediate payment of the debt now due to you, I hereby engage and agree to guarantee you tho payment of any sum he may be indebted to you upon the balance of accounts between you at any timie during the next six years to the extent of 1,000, whenever called upon by you to pay the same." A special case having beenstated for the opinion of this Court in an action to enforce this guarantee to the extent of 731. 9a. 3L, the Court took time to consider, and there being a difference of opinion on the bench, Mr. Baron BAx.wELL now delivered judgment for the defendant on bekalf of himself and Mr. Baron Watson, to the effect that the consideration expressed for the guarantee waw void for uncertainty. The CHr BARON, on the other hand, for himself, delivered Judgment for the plaintiffs, both on the weight of authonty on the subject and with reference to the reasonable costiruction which ought to be put upon the guarantee, reference being had to the whole case. There was no doubt the defendant meant to promise something, and for a consideration, on the faith of which the testator had made fresh advances. In his opinion, the Court wag bound to give some effoct to the manifest intention of the parties, and so to construe the instrument ut res umgis valeat quam pereat. If the consideration expressed was so uncertain and void as to be no consideration at all, as was alleged to be the defect here, the Court ought to see whether there was not another which would render the agreement sensible and available Coad future dealings at all events. This guaranteo might bad for the existing debt, but good for future advances; but, on the whole, he (the Chief Baron) thought it Was altogether good. As, however, the majority of the Court took a different view of it, and he regretted the difference of opinion, the result of the case must be that judgment must be entered for the defendant. Judgment for the defexdant. BL V. 8111PSON. Mr. O'IL&rLsY moved in this case to enter a verdict for the plaintiff in lieu of a nonsuit by leave of Mr. Baron Martin. The questions raised were whether certain transactions constituted an act of bankruptcy, or were a fraudulent preference on the part of the alleged bankrupt. The COURT, after a lengthened discusion, seemed inclined to refuse the rule, but ultimately they took time to consider. * Judgment deferred. ABBOTr V. TEARY. Mr. Serjeant BYvrs moved for a nonsuit in this case, which was recently tried before the Lord Chief Baron, on the ground of misdirection. The action was on a bill of excbange for 3501., and the question was whether the defendant could be made liable as the acceptor, it being admitted that he had not accepted it in fact, and that m all probability it was a forgery by one Harradine. Thst person had been in the habit of making free with the name and credit of the defendant with his knowledge, and the jury found for the plaintiff on the ground that the defen. dant had accredited those dealings by his conduct, and had thereby rendered himself liable for this particular biMl. It was submitted that there was no evidence to warrant the learned judge in leaving that quebtion to the jury, or the jury in finding on it as they had done. Rule nisi granted. NTw TRTAL PAPER. HAND V. WILSON. This was a rule for a new trial, on the ground that the damages were excessive. The action was for assault and battery, and the pleader had laid his damages at 2001., but the jury awarded 3001. As, however, the plaintiff wa limited by the pleader, he couldonly recover 2001., andeven that sum thedefendant seemed to think excessive, whence this rule. Mr. FAtiBsS and Mr. JoYCE having been heard pro and con., The COURT suggested that the proper amount was I00L, and on that footing the rule was ultimately and by consent made absolute to reduce the damages.

OOURT OF BANKA RUPTCY, Bannghai-stremi, May 23. IN} RE J. B. TOWSE. (Rfdm Af. Mr C -PV. A This vas an examination meeting. The bankrupt was a shipowner and attorney at law, of. Lawrence Pountneylane. In this case an adjournment had been ordered for the purposwof amending the accounts. They had now been filed, and variedcbut slightly in substance from those already filed. Mr. Linklater appeared for the assienees, and did not oppose. Mr. Lawirance supported. - The ComssioNmR observed that the bankrupt owed to creditors 18,0001., and to secured creditors 39,0004, while the assets were only about 9001. Mr. LLXLATEAm said that some questions between the assignees and mortgagees were at present undisposed of, and it was possible that the estate might derive some benefit wvhen a settlement was arrived at. The bankrupt passed. A firsrclass certificate was granted to William Sully of the Strand, printer, upon the application of Mr. Bagfiy. There was no opposition.
INSOLYRNT DRBTORS COUBT, Mday 23. IN RE J. GREENVOOn- (Before Mr. Gommiseomer PHmTrps.1 Mr. DOWSE applied on behalf of the insolvent for an allowance from the Unclaimed Dividend Fund, to enable him to obtain his discharge. The insolvent was arrested and lodged in York Castle in June, 1856. He remained there until October, when he removed himself by habeas to the Queen's Prison, London. A creditor having filed a petition, whereupon a vesting order was made, and the inu solvenlfiled scedule upon which ho came up to be heard in this court on the 30th of November last, several creditors opposed, and at theirrequest and expense the insolventwas, under the terms of the 94th section of the 1st and 2d Victoria, cap. 110, remitted to York, that being his last usual plae of residence. He had remained in York Castle until tah 31, when he appeared before Mr. Serjeant Dowling, the Judge of the County Court there, who refused to hear the cuse, upon the ground that it was a creditor's petition upon which he could not act. As the refusal of the learned judge to proceed with the case would deprive the insolvent of al means of obtaining his liberation, the only course open to him was to seek a mzasdamus from the Court of Queen's Bench to Mr. Serjeant Dowling to direct him to hear the case - but as that was a proceeding entailing some expense, which the insolvent had no means to meet, the present application for an allowance under the 118th section was made. Mr. Dowse referred to the case of a man named Race, in which a similar objection on the part of the County Court Judge to entertain the petition led to the issue of a mandamus from the Queen's Bench. Ar. Commissioner PHInins thought if that case were brought under the attention of Mr. serjeant Dowling probably it might affect the learned judge's determination. Mr. MACOuBBEy, amicus curic, said he had obtained the mansdamus in Race's case, but no cause was shown, and therefore the point was not fully argeed. Both Mr. Addison, at Lancaster, and 3r. Serjeant Dowling, at York, refused to be governed by that case, and still declined to hear insolvents upon creditors' petitions. Mr. Commissioner PHILips thought it would be courteous to Mr. Serjeant Dowling to communicate with him in respect to Race's case. If, however, that learned gentleman still refused to proceed with this petition, an allowance would probably be granted to enable the insolvent to obtain his discharge.
MIDDLESEX SE0SSIO2S, Saturday, May 23. (Before the AsSISTANT-JUDGB.) The Court sat to-day to hear rate appeals. There were four on the list, in one of which the rate was reduced by arrangement, and the otherg were adjorirned. Elizabeth Goldsmith, a governess, who was convicted on the 16th inst. of obtaining goods under false pretences from a dressmaker in Regent-street, was brought up. Mr. Giffard had moved ui arrest of judgment, but the ob. jections were overruled, and The Ass9STANT-JuDnGs now sentenced the prisoner to six months' hard labour. Ellen Wilson, who was found guilty of stealing articles, the property of George Chappell Potts, of 516, New Oxford-street, her master, was also brought up for judgment. The prisoner was given into custody for being concerned in stealng eome plate, and the articles she was convicted of stealing were found at her lodgings after that charge was made. She was the widow of a soldier who was klled in the Crlm6a. Mr. RiBTON addressed the Court in mitigation of punishinent. The A9sLsTAxT-.uDGx passed a sentence of six months' hard labour.
POLICE. GUIHALi.-Winiam Shirley, a porter in the employ of the London, Norwich, and Northampton Boot and Shoe Company, in Great Charlotte-street, Blackfriars-road, was chbrged with robbing the Company of boots and shoes to a large amount. The prisoner was fully committed for trial. Bow-sTsxnz.-A needlewomanz named Saral 3eianrd, in the service of Messrs Edmiston and Son, waterproofers of the Strand, was charged with having stolen a number of silk, indiarbber, and alpa coats, &c., the property of her employers. enspector Checkley, of the B division, deposed, thAt in consequence of a burglary committed on the prosecutore premise in October last, the police had been on the lookout for any articles of the description stolen on that oooa. sio*, honing to discover the receivers, one of the principals having Deen aleady convcted and transported. Information wa wtely communicated to him respecting the sale of waterproof goods in one or two quarters tinder suspicious lcirzmtances, and on Friday morning he accomoaned lr. Edmiaton to the Green Dragon publich onse in lSeaden IA pi.retW where an indiarubber overcoat was produced by th6 ladlady, which the prosecator at once identified 5s his property. Having ascertained that this coat had been nrchased at the shop of Mcssrs. .lton and Waer pawnbrokers, of 7 and 8, London-terrace, 3ackny. road, witness and prosecutor prooeeded to that eta blishment, where they found lying on the counter for sale several other coats and capes ot the same deacriution and also the property of Mir. Edmiston. Witnes, still sup. Posing that these goods wero the producoe of the late bur glary, asked the pawnbroker how he came to he seln aticle which had not been in his possuion the tlve month nuired by the Act of Parliament govering their trade ? He replied that some of the articleg sa been in his possession over the twelve months, while, with respoct to others, he bad consented to purchase the duplicates of the srsons pledging them, at the urgent request of the latter witnoss urged that as the burglary wa committed in October none of the goods could have been in pledge more than seven or eight months. The pawnbroker, however, persistd in his statement, and eventually descrlbod the woman of 'whom he had recoived the articles from time to time in pledge. By a lucky accident this woman (the priEoner) presented herself at one of the private entrances to the snop, while witness and prosecutor were stillthere, to pledge other goods. She was immediately identified by . Ednmiston as a wroman who had been in his employ for three years, and witness took her into custody with some of the stolen property in her possession. She at once confeseed that she had been in the habit of robbing her master for a ong time past, concealing the various articles under her ohes whle waiting in the shop to reeeive or deliver up worlc. Witness afterwards went tothe prisoner's lodgings, in Nichols.square, and received a number of pawn- oers'dupicatesfromherdaughter a girl of about 20. Others were found in the rooms, maing no fewer than 83 altogether, relating to Property stolen from the prose Mr. Edmiston asked the magistrate if ke could not indict the pawnbrokers, for he should feel much more anxions to prosecate them than the woman at the bar.They had sold articles at less than a third of their original eost to him as the manufacturer. Mr. HEuY advised him first to consult an attorney, for there ws much difficulty in such cases. The prisoner wras remanded. A donation of 2L 10s. was recelved for llUen Lynch from "X. Y.,' who requested an acknowledgment In Vhe Times. MARLEOROUGH-STREW.-.Edward Crawford was chaged with having entered the shop of Mr. Dare, 37, MIaddoxstreet, Regent-street, at 8 o'clock on the evening of the 11th inst. stolen several gold watches. MrmDare said the prieoner asked to look at the watches, and while doing so he seized the tray of watches and ran off withit. The prisoner denied that he had ever been in the shop. The witness's son, who was in the shop at the time, also spoke to the identity of the prisoner. He was remanded till Thursday next. WosHP-sTR.aT.-Mr. Harman Pickford, Mr. John Bagley, and Mr. William Stephens were charged before Mr HAUMMhL, upon informations, with a serious breach of the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act. Mr. Bodkin attended for the prosecation, and Mr. Orridge for the defendants. The matter, from the numerous attendance of parish functionaries and others, was evidently regarded as one of great local interest, and engroLsed the magistrate's attention for a consdderable time, but the sabstance of it, as deta2led by Mr. Bodkin in his statement of the case against Mr. Bagley, which was taken first, was this :-By the 23d section of the Act above referred to it is enacted that if any inspector appointed under its provisions shall either wilfuly make or cause to be made an incorrect return of the votes given at any election of vestrymen he shall, upon conviction thereof before any justice or justices, be liable for each such offence to any penalty not exceeding 501. nor less than 25. In Shoreditch parish recently two vestrymen tendered their resignatio and seven mnore for the Hoxton district went out in usua course by rotation, for filling the vacancies occasioned by which it became necessary to nave an election, and for that ward or district Mr. Pickford was appointed president, while the defendant Mxr. Bagley and others were appointed to act as inspectors to verify the votes so given. Where the parishioners send in a list of names exceeding these of the number to be electedto fll the vacancies the inspectors, by the terms of the Act, are bound to cancel such hsts altogether, or at least to treat them as though they were not in existence, and the former fact, throngh some misunderstanding, having occurred in this instance, the complaint or allegation was, that the defendants, instead of rejecting tho papers wholly, as they were bound to do, upon.examing the baloting papers, had temporized, as it were, with the difficulty by still regarding these papers as legal, but striking out the names of certain candidates, which they considered as the surplus names, and returning the lsts so amended or emasculated as perfect lists. This they had no right whatever to do, as it would thwart one of the main provisions of the Act - but, as this was the first procecding of the kdnd that had been brought before the magistrate, and it was robable it might have arisen altogether from a misconception of their duties when strictly defined, it was not wished to press for the specified penalties, though it was imperatively necessary that a stop should be put to such courses in future. Ir. Hopkins, a district clerk atthe election, then proved that on the inspectors proceeding to count up the votes and verify the return of vestrymen, it was found that there were several lists containing nine names instead of seven; that the last two were therefore struck out, to the number, he should think, of four or five, but there might be as many, perhaps, as eight or ten. This statement having been further confirmed, Mr. Orridge addressed the bench for his clients, and contended that so far from the charge of wilfuUy pervert'ms the lists, for any purpose whatever, having been proved against them, the facts lay all the other way, as it was manifest that, whatever they were bound to do in strict legality, they had acted throughout in the very best faith, and with an anxious desire to retain as manyvotes and make as fair a return as they possibly could. They were evidently bereft of any partisan feeling, and, rightly or wrongly, considered themselves justified by the circumstances in;what they had done. To establish this much, Mr. Orridge called Mr. Pickford, the president upon the occasion, who gave exactly that version of the whole affair. lr. HAsaL had paid great attention to the facts and evidence, andwasof opinion that though there could be no doubt the defendant had acted in a mauner which was wholly unwarranted by the Act, and in a seriously irregular way, yet that the error had been one of judgment only, not of wilful intention, and he should therefore, in that belief, order the summons to be dismissed. The decision was received with much satisfaction by the majority of the auditors, among whom a partisan feeling obviously existed, aud 3fr. Bodkin said that, under the circumstances, he would take time to consider whether he would proceed with the other informations or not. THAmmo -Joseph Paul Fisman, a German Jew, lately carrying on business as a hair-dresser, in Cable-street, Whitechapel, and Rachael Fixman, his wifEe, were brought before Mfr. SEvEn3 on remand, charged with unlaw/fully and maliciously setting fire to their dwvelling-house, with intent to defraud the Sun Fire and i&fe Insurance Company. This is a most strange case, andhas been noticed before. The prisoners had only been in their late dweeUing for seven or eight weeks, and all their property in the place did not amoant in value,according to one witness, to more than 151., while another valued it at 61. or 71. only. The male prisoner inquired of Mr. John King, a tinplate-worker, the best office to insure his property and effects, and afterwards told King he had applied to the Monarch Fire-office, that his proposal was rejected, and that he had insured his stock IE trade and furniture in the Sun-office for 1001. The prisoner added, that so and so would happen, and on being asked for an explanation, said his place would be on fire. The two prisoners subsequently entered into coiversation with King abont setting their place on fire and obtaining the insurance money, and exhibited to him the preparations for carrying their diabolical intentions intc effect. The male prisoner sent for King on the morning of Tuesday, the 17th instant. and said, " I mean to set fire to the place this evening at 8 or half-pat 8 o'clock." He had previously taken King into an underground kitchen beneatb the shop. There was a pile of wood and coals laid on the grate, and there was a line across the fireplace, and clothes upon it nearly touching the grate. There was another line with rags and clothes upon it hanging close behind, and a line communicatin from the fireplace to some rags on a dresser. The male prisoner asked King what he thought of the arrangements for setting the place on fire to which Kng replied, "You know your own business best ; Satan could not have done it better." King communicated with Inspector Gernon of the H division, and he sent a police-constable named ilarris, No. 81 H, to wAtch the house and the movements of the prisoners. On Sunday evening the prisoners went out, baving first lighted a fire in the grate,but it did not communicate with the lines" as they anticipated. The prisoners returned homue about 9 o'clock at night. Kiing entered the house directly afterw^ards, and the prisoners said they had kindled a fire in the grate, hut the clothes andlines wereonot gnuted.Lne male prisoner said he was glad the fire did not occur, as the canpbine ho had spread over tho rags would have smelt so bady. He then took King into the kitchen again and pointed out to him the g.apipe lying inthe middle of thefloor. It had beenforciblv brokoen offthe branch pipe. The gas was escaping and King told Fixman to atop it, or he would have the house blown up; and he did stopM. Finman then said he would not commence the fire until half.past 2or 3 'clock on 3Mondxy afternoon. On Monday morning King visited the prisoners again. Fixman said everything was ready, and sent his wife out for a pint of naphitha. She came hack and said she could not obtain any. The two prisoners then went out together, and came back With a pint of naphtha which the male prisoner scattered over the rags, clothes, and dresser in the kitchen in the premence of a young man named tin, his assistant, whom he had bired that day, and to whom he said " You must nottell any one whatIlamdoing." Soonafterwardsthe female prisoner went down into the kitchen, and King followed her in a few minutes and found her with a lighted torch made of ngs, and about to set fire to the place He made her put it out and go upstairs. She then put on her bonnet and went out with her child, and sid she was going to convey it to the German HospitaL About a quarter of an hour afterwards the male prisoner went into the kitchen, and when he returned into his shop the fire brokeout,msintended,inthe kitchen, densavolumesof smoke ascended, and the flames came between the boards of the shop near the window. King gave an instant alarm, the police and firemen who were in readiness rushed into the house, and the kitchen door, which was made fast with a padlock, was foroed open, and Harris the policeman was nearly suffocated with the smoke, A German named Steinbereer, a bookbinder, and his family, living in the centre o( the house, had a narow escape from suffocation, ad knocked down the police constable and cut his head in the confusion.

CunRous Cn}inm o' Fxrowy.-On Thursday Mr. James Davenport, saw manufacturer, who had been remanded on bail, was charged before the Sheffield anagistrates with felony by Mr. Charles Brown, a rival manufacturer. The evidence for the proseeation Was, that Mr. Brown had recently received an order for a large quantity of matchet knives, of a peculiar pattern, used in the cutting of sugar canes in the East Indies, and it was alleged that Mr. Davenport, in order to copy the pattern and supplant Mr. Brown 'wtha his customers, had stolen one of the knives, vwhich had been given out to a man named Hoyle to ba ground. Mr. Davenport had sent for Hoyle, and, under pretence of finding him employment, had appointed to cal upon him at his grlndingwheeL Hoyle, suspecting that Mr. Davenport had some other objeet, absented himself. Mr. Davenport went at the appointed hour, along with a friend, and finding the door look-ed, he induced a boy named Harrop to getthrough the windowand reach him oneof Hoyle'x blades, stating that he was desirous of seeing a cane knife. Having obtained one and emunined it, he inquired of the boy where Boyle lived, and said he would call upon him with the knife and make all right. He never did so. Three days afterwards Hoyle went to Mr. Davenport and demanded that the knife should be given up. Mr. Davenport at first denied having taken a kiife, bait, on being confronted with the boy .arrop, admitted it, said the knife was at his house, and ho would return it in three hounrs. Without waiting that time, however, Mr. Brown lodged an information against him for felony. For the defence evidence was given that, in consequenoe of great quantities of inferior goods havig been sent from England, fraudulently bearinz the mark of the Collins' Company of Hartford; ,uitea States, Mr. Davenport had been appiied to by the Sheffield agent of that firm to obtain evidence on which they might found prooeeding againsttheparties. Mr. Davenport having traced an order or a large quantity of cane knives, beaing an imitation of the Collne' Companes 3marlk to have been sent to Mr. Brown from a fLrm at Birmingham, got poemssion of the knife in question, which was one bearing the imitatedmark, intending to submit it to the agents of the Collins' Company, and then return it. In confirmation thst such was his object, it was shown that the knifewasatonco conveyed to Messrs. Firth, the Sheffield agentes, and that the gentleman who was with him when he obtained it from the boy Barrop was in the employ of that firm. It was also shown that a bill in Chanoery had been filed anst tr. Brown for faudulently stiking an imitation of e Collins' Company's mark onhis goods.

TO THE EDITOR OPF THE TIMES. Sir,-& letter that appeared in The Times of Monday last signed "A Post Captain," stating that my method of instantly and safely lowering ships' boats, fitted by orders of 'my Lords" to the troop and transport ships, though avaUable when vessels are under way or at full speed, was nxseless when the ship was stranded or stationary, seemed to me so self condenmatory of the views it advocated that I did not think at the time it required any rejoinder; but, having been caused considerable trouble in being called on to explain sway the fallacy that the ignorance of the naval aathority in question originated, I trust, in common justice, that the ,same means of contradiction, your columins, will be open to me for reply, which I simply make by the comparison that -if a man can jump off a horse when going at full speed he san surely do the same when he is standing stilL It is just e0 with the method of lowering boats by Your nbedint+ -o',-'4 C.

NBTEV SOCIOTY OF FEMALE ARTISTS. There has been of latea lively movement in favour of opening up new channels for female industry. While the extraordinary increase in the numbers Of our people, now acknowledged to be unprecedented, fills the workshops and offices, as well as the learned professions and the army and navy, to overflowing, there are but few employments which afford subsistence to women. The practice of physic is closed to them, although less than two centuries back the " doctoring" of the provincial inhabitants 'was almost wholly performed by women; and in the United States female practitioners in medicine now freely compete with those of the stronger sex. Since the exercise of the pencil is permitted to ladies, and a considerable amount of artistic talent is known to exist inEaglandamong allelassesof women, a society has been set on foot by a few active anti beneficent persons, with the object of collecting the works of female artists into an exhibition for sale. This exhibition will open on the 1st of June, and will comprise, along with the productions of painters byprofession, some contributions fromamateurs, not a few of which are understood to possess distinguished merit. It is nowise intended asarival exhibition to those already before the public, nor do the female artists wish to imply that they consider themselves unfairly treated by the older societies. Into these a fair number of female exhibitors have always been admitted, and their works(which, indeed, have ranked confessedly among the gems of the collection) adequately commended. But a society framed by men, for their own advantage, and necessarily limitedin numbers, cannot open its doors to the applications of female painters without prejudice to the very design of the institution. Nor, again, can the Royal Academy exhibition serve the purpose of a sale room for water-colour drawings, which are naturally eclipsed by their more powerful neighbours in oil. If it be objected that the effect of a Female Artists' Society will be to swel the amount of mediocrity which is annuaUy thrown upon the town in the shape of drawings and paintings, we would reply that in aU departments of art gradations of talent must exist; that the exhibitions actuaUy open, such as the Royal Academy and the Society of British Artists in Suffolk-street, contain no small proportion of inferior specimens of painting in various branches; and that, supposing the Female Artists' Society to produce no greater an amount of mediocrity, compared with works of merit, than the old societies, no partisan of the stronger sex need grudge to the weaker an opportunity of entering the field of honourable competition. It must not be forgotten by those who deprecate the multiplication of second-rate and third-rate pictures that the power of purchasing works of high quality resides with a comparatively small class. But a taste for art may be agreeably fostered by lesa ambitious purchases, and the dwellers in the thousand modest abodes of the metropolis may be encouraged to decorate and enliven their parlours with a fiowerpiece or a landscape of only a few pounds value, without being considered to have committed treason against " high art."
THE PBNINSULAR MAILS. SOUTHAMPTON, MAY 24. The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamship Alhambra, Captain W. J. Woodgates, has arrived from Gibraltar, &c., with the mails, in oharge of Lieutenant Lloyd, R.N., Admiralty agent. She left Gibraltar at 6 30 p.m. on the 16th inst. ; Cadiz, 10 30 am. on the 17th; Lisbon, 11 a.m. on the 19th; Opo rto, 9 anm. on the 20th; and Vigo, 7 p.m. on the 20th. On the voyage home the Alhambra had light breezes and fine weather as far as Cadiz; moderate northerly breeze and fine to Lisbon; light north erly breeze and fine to Oporto and Vigo; thence to Ushant unsettled, and squally at times, and light northwesterly breezes; up to the Needles thick weather, with rain and low barometer, wind from the northward. She passed Hurst Castle at a quarter to 10 o'olock last night, but, in oonsequence of the weabher setting in very thick, and wind from the south-west, was obliged to anchor for the night off Hurst, and came up the river into dock this morning. This steamer brings 32 first-class passengers, 17 second, and 14 deck; and on freight 6 packages of specie (value 2,8571. sterling), 580 chests of oranges, 91 boxes of onions, 69 boxes of potatoes, 7 casks of wine, 32 cases of egg, and 23 packages of sundries. Dates from Gibraltar are to the 16th inst. The Duke and Dachess D'Aumale arrived in the Bay on the morning of the 12th in the steamship Albanian, Captain Glover, bound for Liverpool; the steamer resumed its voyage at 3 o'clook in the afternoon, after taking in some fresh provisions, &c. A fire broke out about midday on the 12th inst. on board the British steamer Powerful, which had put into the Bay on the previous day to coal, on her way from London to Malta, Constantinople, and Odessa, laden with a general cargo. The fire was soon got under. Exchanges at Gibraltar on the 16th were quoted as follows :-London, 90 days' date, 514; Paris, ditto, 5f. 39c. Marseilles, ditto, 5f. 40a. ; Genoa, ditto, 56. 42c.; Madrid eight days' sight, 1 dis.; Cadiz, ditto, J dis. * a, ditto, 1 dis.; Seville, ditto, a dis.; Alicante, 1 Jduls;alencia, dis.; Barcelona, J dis.; Spanish pillared dollars, 4 per cent. pm. Demand dull. The Brazilian corvette Imperial Marinheiro, Captain Alyin, anchored in the Bay on the afternoon of the 11th, from Cadiz, and saluted the garrison with 21 guns, whlch compliment was duly returned by the saluting battery. This vessel is from Brazil, on an experimental craise, and has on board a number of naval cadets, who have been ordered by the Imperial Government to visit some of the principal dockvards and arsenals of Europe for scientific purposes. The imperial Marinheiro sailed again on the morning of the 14th, bound to Toulon, Naples, and Messina, thence to Marseallesand Algiers, and afterwards will return to the Brazils, touching at Gibraltar on her way home. The British steamships Sydney, Australian, and Adelaide passed the Rock to the eastward on the 11th, 13th, and 14th respectively. Thewe vessels have been chartere4 by the Government to take from Malta the 1st Royals (2d battalion) and 47th Regiment, which are to relieve the 15th and 96th Foot, doing garrison duty at Gibraltar. The British steamer Peninsula, Captain Watson, from London and Southampton, with a general cargo for Gibraltar and Cadiz, arrived at Gibraltar on the 13th. On the 16th inst. the Alhambra passed and exchanged night signals with the screwv-steamship Jura, passing through the Straits, from Southampton for Malta and Alexandria, with the Australian mails. Several vessels passed through the Straits, homeward bound, on the 16th, but in Gibraltar Bay there were very HerAMajesty's ship Curlewwas at Gibraltarwhen the Albambra left. At Lisbon, on the 19th, were Her Majesty's ship Princess Roval and the usual Portuguese squadron. The Lisbon exchanges for bills at three months are quoted this mail as follows:-London, 53., at which few bills were pasred, the takers requiring generally 534, at which some trifles were negotiated ; Paris, 53.3 to 53a; Amsterdam, 41 ; Hamburg, 474 ; Genoa, 532. BilUs were scarce on the continent, and transactions consequently limited. In stocks and shares little activity had been evinced. Three per Cents. registered were at 48 to 48.4; Coupons, 47 to 474 ; and Deferred, 28l to 284; Bank of Portugal shares, 8 to 10 per cent, premium; and Bank of Oporto shares, 22. to 25 per cent. premium.

THE GBEAT SHREWSBURY CASE. The claim of Lord Talbot to the earldom of Shrewsbury is now at length fairly before the House of Lords, and it will come on for hearing at the earliest possible opportunity after Thursday next. As it directly involves the first and oldest earldom in the land. and indirectly affects estates of the annual value of 40,0001., our readers will readily believe us when we say that the Shrewsbury case will rival in interest and importance the great Douglas and Berkeley cases. The printed document formallyasserting the claim on the part of his Lordship was laid upon the table of the Upper iouse on Thursdaylast. It consists of 4lpages of genealogical and other matter, and is entitled "'The Case of the Right Ron. Henry John Chetwynd, Earl Talbot, claiming to he Arl of Shrewsbury." It states thatthe elaimant having presented a petition to Her Majesty, praying that the title, dignity, and peerage of Earlof Shrewsburymight be declared .and adjudged to belong to him, and that a writ of summons to Parliament might issne to him by the title and dignity aforesaid, Her Majesty was pleased to refer the said petition, together with the Attorney-General's report Thereon, to the House of Peers on the 9th of May, 1857, who, on the 11th day of May, referred it to the Committee of Privileges to consider and report thereon. It first recites the terms and limitations of the patent under which the earldom was originally conferred in 1442 upon John Talbot, the great Earl of Shrewsbury, and General of the English army in the wars with France, and carries down the pedigree, step by step, through seven generations, from lather to son, in a direct line, until the elder branch of the first Earl's family became extinct on the death of Edward, eighth earl, without issue male, on the 8th of February, 1617. It then shows how, on the failure of the elder line, the earldom descended upon the heirs male of Sir Gilbert Talbot, of Grafton, K.G., as representstive of Gilbert, third son of the second earl, and was enjoyed by them successively down to the year 1856, when it became extinct by the death of Bertram Arthur Talbot, the late earL at Lisbon. It further recites that Earl Talbot now claims to be -entitled to the earIdoms of Shrewsbury, Wexford, and Waterford, as nsarest heir male of the said Sir Gilbert Talbot, through the second marriage of his son John, and consequently as nearest heir male of the body of the first earl, and that he begs leave to lay before this most hon. Hons6e the present "case" in support of his claim. The "case," which is signed by Sir F. Thesiger, Sir F. *Kelly, and Mr. T. F. Ellis, barrister-at-law, as counEel for the claimant, alleges that Sir John Talbot of Al. brighton married as his second wife Elizabeth Wrottesley, by whom he had issue two sons, of whom the elder died Youn, while the line was continued by the younger son, john, of Salwarp, who married Olive Sherrlngton, and whose son, Sherrington Talbot, left by his second marriage, with Mary, daughter of John Washbourne, three sons, of whom the two elder died without leaving issue and that the line of descent was continued by the third eoa, William, some time Bishop of Dnrham. He was the father of Charles Talbot, Lord Chancellor of Enuland, who was raised to the peerage in 1733 as Lord Talbot, and whose son, created EArl Talbot of Ingestre in 1784, was grandfather of the present claimant. We understand that the opponents of his Lordship's claim are three in number-first, the Duke of Norfolk, as guardian of the interests of his infant son, to whom the late earl bequeathed his magniJicent property at Alton Towers; secondly, the Princess Doria Pamphili of Rome, as only surviving child of John, 16th earl; and thirdly, MIajor Talbot, of Castle Talbot, county Wexford, as a rival claimant to the title. In event of Earl Talbot being able to establsh his claim to the earldom of Shrewsbury to the satisfaction of the Committee of Privileges, his Lordship will become premier earl of England and also of Ireland, as also Earl of Wexford and waterford ; and then we imagine a further suit will have to be entered upon before the Court of Chancery for possession of the Shrewsbury estates at Alton and other places in the counties of Stafford, Oxford, Worcester, and Berks. In case, however, the House of Lords should decide that his Lordship's claim is "not proven," the other claim -namely, that of Major Talbot, will be submitted for their Lordehius' decision. The gzallant Major as we understand, traces his pedigree up toWilliam, fourth son of George, the fourth earl, who was made a Enight of the Garter for his valiant conduct at the Battle of Stoke, June the 16th, 1447.
CHmSrrEB RAiLwAY STATiox.-On the Cup Day the enormous number of 36,fiO0 passengers pased through this station, vid the Great Western, the North-Western, .and Birkenhead lines, without, owing to the able super-ission of alr. iills and his coadjutors, a single accident or ,unusual delay, and although there are 100 trains daily passing the station. VORAVITY OF A CoD.-As a fishing boat belonging ,to Barra was lately putting out to sea the men picked up a dead lamb, and having skinned it threw the skin into the tea. They then proceeded, with a smart breeze riht aft, u,ut into the Atlantic, till they lost sight of land. q:aving at length reached the fishing place they dropt their lines. The first fish taken up was a large cod, whose bely was dis. 1ended to such an extraordinat7 size as to excite the curiosityaf the crew. They eut.open the fish, and to their astonishment found in it the felf-sarne skin, wool and ad entire, which iey had thrown overboard in the morning after leava13e,4>j,-rzerctW

TaB ATLANTIC SuBXnIN? CABLE.-Welearm that }Mr. W. Brown, M.P., chairman of the Atlantic Telegraph Company, Mr. Brett and Mir. Pickering, directors, accompanied bg Captain Kells, have been on board the noble ship iagara, Captain Hudson, at Gravesend, to confer and arrange with himn about laying that portion of the submarine cable which is to go to the westward,to connect and bind the Old and the New world, permanently, we trust, in harmoay and peace. Nothing could exceed the gentlemanly and courteous feeling with which they were received by Caphtin Hudson and his officers. After going through the ship, it wan found, to their extreme regret, that, without ruining her, by cutting away stauchions, there was not space to m e seuficiently large circular coils of the cable to secure ite afe delivery into the ooean, which, in such an enterprise, is the first point to be attended to. Indeed this is not surprising, for although Sir Baldwin Walker was most anxious that the British Government shoTld furnish suitable vessels to do their part of the enterpise. Captain Kells was three months looking over the dockyards to find one that would do. The Agamemnon was at last fixed on, but she required considerable alterations. If time admitted, there can be no doubt that among the United States' navy would be found a suit_ble vesael, and that tho Government would send her here to aid in this great international undertaking. Captain Hudson stated that his orders from the Secretary of the Navy were to do everything in his power to forward the enterprise, and that he, his officers, and crew felt a deep interest in it, and wereready to do anything that would contribute to its triumphant success. It was felt by all parties that these two great nations must be united in carrying out this important work, aud probably the best thing that could now be done was for the Niagara to take on board the shore end of the cable, and lead the vau of that parb of the squadron going to the Western World, and be ready to give every necessary assistance. In this suggestion Captain Hudson most cheerfully acquiesced, saying he was ready to do any. thing the deputation wished to aid and assist the undertaking. The United States, desirous of conferring Pl the honour possible upon this country, sent one of their noble,t ships, and, to a person who knows what a vessel should be, an nSpectio of the Niagara would be 'worth a voyage across tbe Atlantic. Everything was in the most perfect and beau.- tiful order. She is construted for sailing and for eurposes of war, andnot for carrying suchalegthof cableas is neoea. sary to annihilate time and space between the two ktindfred nations. None but practical engineers who have been in the habit of laying down submarine cables could foresee what constructionl of vessel would best anwer the purpoe and leave least risk in paying out the cable;- a ,bight"l or a "kink" might be fatal to the wholo operation. This being a bold enterprise, nothing must be left to chance. After the squadron has started we shall look forward with much interest for a message from Newfoundland informing us that all is right.-.Liverpool Albion.

RE-CArnRE oF Ax ESCAPED CoNvIC.-Upon the11th of this month, a man named Peter Hutchison, orBlth, or Bailie, under sentence of 15 years' transportation, escaped from Jedburgh prison. On Thursday, constable Christie, of the Edinburgh County Police,- stationed, at Gorebridge, got information of a man answering hiwdescription being in that neighbourhood. Having obtained the assistance of his neighbouring constables, they pro. ceeded to Old Middleton, and there succeeded in appre. bending him, w,hen in company with threemen, all of whomi had empty sacks nnder their arms, ready to start off on a nocturnal foray. Tue prisoner w*as conveyed by Chrisee to. hsold quarters,d ATrn=rrr AT't Mus ..-Aii attempt at murder was yesterday made at Witham, Essex, under the following circumstances:-A younig woman named Freeborn, cook to Mr. James Upson, farmer in the parish named, became "engaged" to a young man named Charles Minb who was then working at a farm in the neighourhood, oft elvedon. Soon after the coimmenoement of tlis engagement he went out to the Crimea to join the Army Works Corps, or as a navvy, and but recently returirea to the neighbourhood. In the meantime it seems theb young woman bad formed an attachment in some other quarter, which appears too likely to cost her herlife. A few minutes after 3 yesterday she left her master's house for the purpose of proceeding to the Parish church, distant about half a mile, and, so far as her own statement can be understood, had not proceeded many yards before she saw F nich sitting on the bnk-, much to hersurprise, for she bad not seen him since his return, and, indeed, betieved him to be in Londlon. He waited untilt she waa quite close to him, thenL suddenly sprung upon her, threw her down in the ditch, and 'with a razr cut hertroat, without uttering a sinele worL Le then made off; but apparently fearing he had not fully accomplished his purpcso he returned again a fewr minutes afterwardmt and made a second incision, and then immediatelymade oft. The poor girl must have been very soon found, for aboutb 8830 a messenger arrived at the Witham police station, Theconstables, with the exception of one, were at the paislr church; they were, however caUed out during the service, causing, as may be supposed, no small consternation Amonir the congregation, and, with Mr. Superiuteudent Cooke oc the Essex constabulary, were speedily o2t the spot, Mr. Thomas Tomkin, a medical gentleman, being already in attendance. The young woman, who is about 24 yeas oEage, and bears a respectable character, being re xoveo to her master's honse, search wa immnediately oom. menced in the woods, and in a few hours Finch was. captured by a labouring man namea Greenas howa attempting to escape from the wood. Police-consaUbto Idedley, who was near, took him in charge, and by 7 o'clocLin the evening be was lodged in a cell at the With%= police station. The windpipe is completelr severed, butF the main arteries have escaped; so that there is so;D3 chance of the poor woman's recovery [Advertisement.] " Rusa after the War," bv WsG accontof a J,iet to 1ussia by a EnFlish ly since ubewDIV,wj bme roadwith i oet by an cagsseu Mi 3NbDz, Wa Iseset a7t _ ; ; corouation, and indeed Paw evezythiog vhleh KunAria,cegs bas bad to show.
