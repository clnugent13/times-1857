PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGENCE. HOUSE OF LORDS, F1R&AY, FB. 8. Their Lordships met at 5 o@clock. THE FERMOYP P1RAGE. The Earl of DERBY begged to remind their lordships that in the coursc of the last session he comimunicated to them that a patent had been issuea to constituto a person named Roaed Baron of Fermoy, and that an objection was raised against the valdity of the patent, on the ground that the case had not arisen which autholrized the Crown to grant it, three Irish peerages not having become extinct. As the question thus raised appeared to be one of considerable constitutional importance, the natter was referred to a Committee of Privileges. Since that time he had been given to understand that the same issue would be raised, and perhaps in a more convenient shape, upon that gentleman s presenting a petitien, praYinz that his claim might besubstantiated,and he(Lord orbey) therefore, deferred the question for that event. This was a case altogether beside all personal considerations, whatever way the question might be decided, inasmuch, as since the question was raised, the lapse of the 12 months after the expiry of the third peerage, as required by the terms of the Act of Union, had occurred. The only point at issue was whether thiepatent should bear date mn 1856 or 1855, and, conseguently, Lord Fermoy had no personal interest in this question, though it was one of considerable constitutional and political importance. He be%ed to ask the noble earl, the Persident of the Council whet er ho had any reason to belecve that a petition wrould, wiithin a very short period, be presented ? and, at the same time, it might lead to a more speedy issue of the question, if he gave notice that unless before this day fortmght such a petition should be presented and referred to the Committee of Privileges, he oshuld revive the motion of last year, and move that the Committee of Privileges be reappointed to inquire into the subject. E arl GRANVILE said that, before the opening of the session he had received a letter from Lord Fermoy, expressing his earnest desire that the question should be brought forward for decision as soon as possible, and asking him whetherhe concurred inthatophmon. Re had answered in the afflirmative, and requested Lord Fermoy to desire his legal adviser to call upon him in London. That gentleman had done so. and had informed him that a petition had been urepared last session, but it had been mpislid, partly by his {Earl Granville's fult. The agent, however, aundertook that another petition-on the part of Lord Peney should be prepared, and since then he had been in daily expectation of receiving that petition. Re therefore hped that the subject woulidb brought before the Rouseswithin the periodreferred to by the noble earl. THE NTEW MIISTER OF EDUCATION. Earl GRf VILLE moved the first reading of a bill for appointing a Vice-President of the Comnittee of Council on Educati on. The bill would preside tait the Mdinister shlould have a seat in the other house ; and upon the second readieg of the bill heowould take the opportaunityof explaining the nature of the changes to be made by an order in Council, transferring certain departments attpresent connected with other offices to the Vice-Presidency of the Council. The bill was then reada first time. THlE PALL OP EARlS. The Earl of ELLENBOROUGR-As I understand the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs will leave this country very soon on a mission to PaLri, and as it is very desirable that the debate upon the fall of tara should take place before Ths depar I should hke to know on what day the papers promisedon the subject are likely to be presented to the Rouse, 3arl GRAn, VIelE.-Those papersnwill be presected very soon, but I canuot name the precise day. TheEarl of ELINthOROUJG.-The noble earl will ace the difEiculty in which we shall be placed by proceeding withthe debate in the absence of the Secretary for Foreign Aairs. (Hear, hear.) IRISH4 REPRESENTATIVE PEERAKGE. The Earl of DO-tOUeGlMORE gave notice that, wthen the subjectof the Phery patent of peerage came under disecussion, he should call attention t the grievances under which the Irfish peers Isoured in voting for members of their body to represent them in that house. THE WENSLEY5DALE; LIFE PEERAGE. Eoarl GREY.-In the absence of the noble and learned lord w,ho moved the resolution which the Reuse adopted last night, I beg leave to ask the noble and leanued lord the Chief Justice whether le can give any infoermatien to the House as to when the Comamittee of Privileges which has been decided upon is to sit, and what is the course intended to betakena ponfthatnquestion? LordvCAMH PBEr L.-In the absence of my noble and learned friend it is impossiblc for me to give any satisfactory answer to the question which has been addressed topme - but Itmay take this opportunity of expressin amhope that au course will be adopted by Her Majestys Governmecnt which will render thc meeting of that committeeunnecessary. (Rear, heBar.) Of course I cannot take upon mysef to give advice to Rer Majesty's Government they can have that advice from quarters much more entitled to consideration sbtU as a mcmber of this House, I may earnestly express the hope that they will take a step which, in my opinion, would le of infinite advantage, and that they will recommend her Majesty graciously to confer upen the Right ron. Sir James Parke, late Baron of the Exchequer, the title of Baron WFensleydale, to be enjoyed by him and the heirs male of his body. (Hiear, hear.) That being done, my lords,vwe shall snort joyously receive him in this house, and thus put an end to an agitation w hich seems to me calculated to lead to no good. Nzothing will thereby be decided; the question lwill be still left open; and, if a pressing necessity should arise for creating a peer for life, that may still be done. I should rejoice exceedingly if this course were adopted, for I do most sincerely feel that it would be of great senice to the nation at large. (Hear.) The Earl of DERBY.-My lords, I can claim still less right than the noble and learned lord to offer any recommendation to Her Majesty's Government, but I cannot help feeling that his suggestion is one well deserving of consideration. I am quite sure it cannot be the object of the Government to raise unnecessarily a question which is nianifestly one of extreme difficulty, as between the ererogative of the Crown and the House of Lords. rom whiat passed last night, from the general opinion expressed by the law lords-by the Lord Chief Justice, who, as far as he can tikc any part in politics, is attached to Her Mfajesty's Government-by my noble and learned friends near me, and by all the great law authorities in this house, save and except the noble and learned lord on the woolsac, there is clearly a preponderance of opinion to the effect that even if this patent be strictly legal it is in the highest degree unconstitutional. Moreover, if noble lords who upon most occasions vote with Her Miaesty's Government, recorded their votes last night in opposition to the co-rse which has been pursued, thus proving, at least, how distasteful the exercise of such a prerogative would be to this House, then I cannot but think Hor Majesty's Government would be consulting the piblic interest, and also what I consider to be identified with the public interest-namely, the rights and prerogative of the C,rown, if they declined unnecessarily to raise this question of the strict lg,ality of the prerogative, and consented not to cancel the patent, but to issue a new one. This new patent would involve to the individual no consequences in the slightest degree different to the first patent, and would be produlced with the writ when Lord Weusleydaile appeared to take his seat in this house. I am quite sure that those noble lords with whom I have the honour of acting will most ladly receive that solution of a difficulty into which they have been most unwillingly drawn, and there wiU be but one opinion with regard to the reception in this house of so distinguished a lawyer as Baron Parke. I have not seen my noble and leaned friend who brought forward this question since he left the house last night; I have no idea of the course which he means to pursue with regard to the comimittee; but, on public grounds, I entirely join the Lord Chief Justice in hoping that there may be no occasion ultimately for the consideration of this question by the tribunal to which your lordships last night decided, and, as I think, properly decided, itshould be referred. (Hear, hear.) Earl GnAxvmLr rose, but- Lord BROUGRAM, interposing, said he thought that in the absence of his noble and learned friend it would be premature for any one to give an opinion as to the course which his noble and learned friend would pursue. Earl GRAI4VIIIE again rose, and the general impression appeared to be that hewas abeut to ad s oher Irships; but he simply moved, arnidst some laughter, " that this Rouse do new adjourn," which was assented to 71sMe- CO ro aon a h- Their Iordships adjourned at half-past 5 o'clock,
HOUSE OF COIDIONS, FRIDAY, FB. 8. The SrEAmU took the chair at 4 o'clock. NEW 1IBERS. LordRAY-,% rand Mr. WAsP.nr took the oaths and their seats-thefornerfor Tamworth, and the latter for flidhurst. Petitions against openingthe Crvst Palace, National Gallery, and the British Museumnon Sundays were presented by Mr. PIATLTA, from the minister and congregationof the Congre.gational Church, York-street, Walworth; by Mr. Sroo_NE, from the vicar and churchwardens of Coleshill, in the county of Warwick; by Colonel StymH, from the Lord's-day Defence Association of the city of York; by Mr. A. S5TH, from the parish of Tewin, in the county of Hertford; and by Mr. HUTT, from the Wesleyan Methodists of Gateshead; by Mr. M. SaIITH, from the resident ratepayers of East Malling, Kent, against the abolition of church-rates; by Mr. MACKIE, from the Synod of Galloway, for an increase to the salaries of theparochial schoolmasters of Scotland; by Colonel S3nT}m, from the licensed victallers of the city of York, praving that soldiers quartered in the city (and not passing through it on the march) may be stationed in barcks, and not billetted; also, from the York board of guardi;ms, against the contemplated Rura Police Bill; and byMr. OnSF, from the ^ioalwhippers and others employed on the Thames, in favourof closing publichouses on the Sunday. THIE IPISH BENCHE Sir J. SHELEY said that, instead of moving for a commnittee on the efficiency of the Irish judicial bench, he should move for a return showing the number of times the judges had'been absent at any assize, and the reasons for such absence. LOCAL DUES ON SHIPPING BIUL. In reply to MIr. HosiALT, lMr. LOWE said, this bill would not be in the hands of members before Wednesday. THE POLICE BILL. Sir G. GREY postponed the second ;eading of this bill from Monday to Wednesday nest. SCOTCH POOR LAW. In reply to Mr. E. E}acz, Sir 'G GREY sid, the sdject of Poet lAw adbIWi.}tl tion in the EHighland counties was under consideration, and the Lord-Advocate -would, at an early period, stato the decision of the Government with regard to it. - - ARCTIC EXPEDITIONS. Admiral WALCOTT begged to ak the First Lord of the Admiralty whether and when it was the intention of the Governmen,t to grant a medal to those engaged in the several Arctic expeditions, conformably with the recommendation to that effect contained in the report of the Select Committee on the Arctic Expeditions in the last session ? Sir C. WOOD said, the Queen had been graciously pleased to signify her intention to confer a medal on the officers and men engaged in the Arctic expeditions, and measures were being taken to carry that intention into effect. There was, however, great pressure at present in preparing the Crimean medals, and it would be some time bore the Arctic medal could be prepared. THE CRIMEAN COMMISSION. Lord W. GRAHAM begged to ask the Under-Secretary forWar whether the officers animadverted on in the Crimean report had sent in any further explanations on the subject to the Government, or the authorities at the Hlorse Guards; and, if not, whether tho Govermnent intended to call forany? Yr. F.PEEL thought he might call on the noble lord to state who were the officers he considered aninadverted upon in this report. Some of the officers who might bh considered to have been animadverted upon were in the Crimea, and had had no opportunity of seeing the report, stil less of volunteering any statement in their own vindication, if they desired to do so. Others had been relieved from the offices they held at the time, and were no longer in the employment of the Government. He presumed that the Quartermaster-General at the Horse Guards was the principal person alluded to. It was not necessary to call for any explanation of the conduct of that officer because, feeling that the report reflected upon his administration under Lord Raglan, he had announced his intention to reply to it. Ho was also informed that Lord Lucan had mode a statement remonstrating against the manner in which he had been alluded to in the report. Lord W. GRAHAM asked if these papers would be laid on the table of the house? Mr. PEEL said, they were not yet made. OPERATIONS IN THE CHINA SEAS. Mr. H. BAILLIE said, the question of which he had given notice in reference to the conduct of Admiral Stirling and Captain Eliot in the China Seas required a few words of explamation. A statement had appeared in the public papers purporting to be tho report of the proceedings of Her Majesty's fleet in those seas. (Cries of " Order i) The SPEAERE intimated that the hon. member could not make a statement in putting a question. Mr. II. BA LE said, he should then move the adjournment of thc House. Although the Government might think proper to disregard the statements which appeared in the newspapers, they were not justified in allowing false statements and misrepresentations to pass current for a length of timo without contradiction wlhen they reflected on the honour and character of the British navy. The statement was this,-that Admiral Stirlin being in command of the British fleet in the China Seas, lad received instructions to pg e, captre, and destroy a Russian squadron which was know to e in those 'water, and that, under those circumstances, he thought it consistent 'with his duty to devolve that command upon a junior officer, and to occupy himself with a treaty-a so-called commercial treaty with Japan. Captain EUiot, the officer in question, found the Russian squadron at anchor in De Castries-bay. Two statements had been published with respect to the strength of the Russian squadron. One statement, which differed very little from the other, Was issued by the Russian Government and published in the St. Pctersburg Gazette, and according to that statement the Russian force consisted of one frigate, one corvette, and three transports encumbered and loaded with the fugitives-men, women, and children-fromn the Russian settlement of Petropaulovski. The other statement was made by a gentleman, who had lately published a book upon the subject, a friend of Captain Elliot, Captain Wittiugham, an officer of engineers, who was sailing with Captain EUiot. He would read that statement to the House, though it differed very little from the Russian account. Captain Wittingham stated that there were a frigate and a long corvette, mounting 18 or 20 guns; two corvettes, or, porhaps, armed transports, mounting 10 or12 longp,guns each a ni and a small steamer:- ' From each masthead of aU the Russian vessels their wlhite ensigns waved. From our masthead the number of guns seen on each vessel was reported, and it was conjectured that the frigate was the Aurora, of 44 guns; that the corvette was probably the Dvwina, of 18 or 20; but 'whether the other vessels were corvettes of 20, or armed transports of 10 or 12 guns, seemed problematical in the unaccountable and blameable state of ignorance all the officers seemed in of the number, size, and description of the few vessels Russia possessed in these seas, and this lamentable ignorance existed 13 months after the declaration of war." It appeared from this statement that Captain Elliot had not really ascertained what the strength of the Rissians w.as, or hether the ships before himwere shipsof warortransports. Having stated the strength of the mussian squadron, he would state also the strength of the English squadron. It consisted of a first-class frigate, the Sybile, of -10 guns, the Hornet, of 17 guns, and the Bittern, of 12 guns. It was under those circumstances that Ca tam Elliot declined to en ge the Russian squadron. He detennined to send one of his ships to search for the admiral, who was, he believed, in Japan, 1,500 miles off, and appeared not to have thought it necessary to blockade the Russian force. He would give the statement of his proceedings:- "No sooner had the daylight entirely failed than the three vessels stood out to sea, and during the two following days slowly sailed to the south, to accompany the Bittern (what did the Bittern want of their company?), which left us on the 23d when the frigate and corvette commenced cruising in a narrow part of the gulf to prevent the escape southward of the Russian squadron, until the 27th, when the two vessels bore up to Do Castres Bay." It appeared that after a week Captain Elliot thought it necessary to go and see what the admiral was doin-, and he appeared to have been surprised to find that the'ktussiais had refused to wait for the convenience of himself and the gallant admiraL As soon as they saw the coast clear they set sail for the mouth of the Amoor river, and arrived at their destination. They passed the bar safely, andplaced their ships in a state of security. That was the statement that had beenscurrent for some time, and whichhebelieved to be true. He should be happy if the First Lord of the Admiralty could give a satisfactory explanation; but, in the meanwhile, he wished to ask whether the Goverument had received an official statement of these proceedings - whether those despatches would be laid upon the table; wbether the Government were satisfied with the con. duct of their officers; and whether they intended to submit that conduct to a court-martial? The hon. member concluded by moving the adjournment of the House. Sir C. WOOD.-I certainly have not seen the statement to which the hon. gentleman has alluded, but I cannot admit that it is the duty of Her Majesty's Governmnent to sift every story that may appear in the public papers. The best course will be for me to statewhat I know to be the facts. There is no doubt that the admiral had the usual orders to take, capture, and destroy all the enemy's vessels that he could fall in with. It is not true that Admiral Stirling delegated to a junior officer the authority to search for the Russian squadron. He sent a junior officer with some ships to intercept the escape of the crew of the Russian fngate Pallas, which was lost on the coast of Japan, and the crew of which was sup posed to be endeavourng to effect their escape to their own country. Captain Elliot was also directed to cruise in the upper waters of the PacifLe, in the hope of meeting any Russian vessels that might happen to be there. There was no reason to suppose that the vessels in question would be found there. It was very unknown region, of which no accurate survey had been made, and of which no acenrate chart was in the possession of Captain Elliot up to the time he went there. Perhaps, in order that the House may clearly understand what occurred, I may be permitted very shortly to state the nature of those seas. [The right hon. gentleman here commenced a description of the geographical features of the scene of operations, bht, as he spoke with even more than his customary indistinctness of utterance, the explanation could not be heard either by hon. members or by the reporters. A cry of " Speak up P from the back benches failed in the desired effect, and when the tight hoen gen tleman was again partaly heard he was spealdng ta the following effect]:-At the close of May Captain Elliot was cruising at the end of the Gulf of Tartary, and on the 20th of May wvith the force which the hon. gentleman has accurately stated, consisting of the sailing frigate Sybille, of 40 guns, the sailing ve Bittern, of 12 guns; and the Hornet steamer, he came in sight of the enemy in DeCastriesBay. In that baytheydiscovered the Russian vessels, and the Hornet was sent in to reconnoitre. Later in the day Captain Elliot went on board the Hornet and completed the reconnaissance. The Russian force consisted of the large frigate Aurora, of 44 guns; the large corvette Olovetska, of 24 guns; and the Dwinn, another vessel of 20 guns, lying moored with their broad: sides to the entrance of the bay, and behind them a larger vessel bearing a rear-admiral's flag. They could not make out whether this was a large armed transport or a corvette, but it tuned out afterwards that it was an armed transport of eight guns. There was also a steamer qf six guns, and another vessel, making in all six Russian vessels discovered in the harbour. Shots were exichanged with one of the corvettes, whEich fell short on both sides. The hon. gentleman asks whether we are of opinon that CaptainElliot did wrong in not attemptingto enter the harbour. The opinion we have formed Is, that Captain Ellot was rfectly justified in not attempting to enter the harbour und the circumstances. He had two sailing vessels and only one steamer; it was an unknown harbour, the soundings of which had not been taken, and it now turns out that if they had attempted an entrance it -is almost certain they would havo been lost. It app that the passagewhichtheyattempted, and which was the only one ofrwhich they then knew, was not the red one, and that if they had attempted to enter by that passage the Sybile would have gone aground, and 3night have been lost. The next question put by the hon. gentle. manis as to the blockade of the port. What Captain Ellot did was to lie off the harbour next day, and try to provoke the Russians to come out. But they knew their own game better than that, and remained safe in the harbour. The wind blew off the shore, and it was impossi ble for them to enter an unknown channel gaarded by the broadsides of three vessels. Captain Elliot then had to consider what course was best to be taken to insure the objects for which he ws there, and to prevent the escape of the Russian fleet. I v'ill read Captain Elliot's account of the course he adopted:- "It appears to me highly probable that the Russian squadron will immediately attempt to escape to the southward, oet of the Gnlf of Tartary.' Mybiectwill now be to prevelit their doing so, and I sha take up such positions withthe Sybille and the Hornet as to watch their move: mentS shoud that be their intention. My-opinion is that if they move they will do so at once, andtry to make their escape through t'he Straits of Perouse. This strait being only 25 miles across, their squadron is less likely to escape I me there than it would be by my cruising in the northern I part of the Gulf of Tartary,where there is a greater breadth to guard; the alternate strong winds and thick fogs of these seas being much against suecessfully blockading or watching a port. The GuLl of Tartary as also somewhat contractedbetween Cape Lamanon and the Isle de la Prise. I therefore propose guarding that channel for a day or two, should the weather remain favourable for my doing so, .and then to cruise between Cape Romauzoff in lat 450 25? N.,long. 141° 34' E., and the opposite shore of Cape That is the official report of the course which Captain Ellot thought it advisable to take, and that is confirmed by several private letters written by Captain Elliot which I have seen, and which state that the weather was so thick and the fog so prevalent that it was impossible to watch any port. What lie really wanted was steamers susaU enough to enter the barbour, and he took the wise measure of sending to the admiral to obtain moro reinforcements, especially steamers. It was desirable that the enemy should not know the direction in which he was gone, and, therefore, Captain Elliot sailed at night. He attempted to reach the narrow part of the Gulf of Tartary, because it was only there that he was likely to intercept the enemy. I will read the following extract from a privato letter of Captain Elliot:- "With my two ships I could only attempt to stop them going in what I thought the most likely direction for them to take, as it is impossible to keep sight of a place in the thick fogs of these seas, and, with a constant south wind, a few hours' fog would be quite sufficient for them to run out of sight with)' These are the reasons that induced Captain Elliot to take the course he did. Iam inclined, however, to think that he oughtto have remained off the mouth of DeCastriesEay, and Ithink no sufficientreasonhasbeen given for his notdoing so. On the other band, It would be rash of us sitting here, and not knowingthe state of the weather at the time, to attempt to come to any decisive opinion. Captain Elliot is a young and a very enterporising officer, as he proved during Ins service in the Mediterranean HIe had looked forward most anxiously to the capture of the Russian frigate, and I have no doubtthathe honestly and conscientiously believed, upon the grounds I have stated, that he was taing the course best calculated to insure that capture. There was great probability that the Russian squadron would not be able to escape at all, and bethought thatcienifitshouldreachaplace of refuge it could not go to any place where it could do any injury to our trade, whereas he knew that it would injure our trade considerably if it once arrived inthe Straits of Perouse. He believed tha i was of paramount importance to prevent the Rsians from aoing southward and that if they escaped north ward it woud ul1timasely be in his powser, w.hen a reinforcement arrved, to effect their capture. I certainly think that he was wrong in not remnaining off the months of the hay, but I cannot say that if he had remained the result w.ould have been different. llr. ELLIOT thought the friends of Captain Elliot had good cause to complain of the course taken by the hon. gentlemani opposite. (Hear, hear.) If the hon. gentleman intended to make an attack upon Captain Elliot it would only have been fair to put some notice of his intention upon the paper. (Cheerm) Tho hon. gentleman had made two distinct aceusations; first, that Captain Elliot did not attack the Russians; and, secondly, that ho sailed away southward, wishing, as the hon.gentleman seemedtoinfer, to escape from them. The second of these charges was most unjust; and it was one which he hoped would neverbe made with truth against any British officer. (Hear, hear.) What had Captain Elliot done? Hfe hadgone to De Castries Bay, to an unsurveyed port, upen an ansurveyed coast, in very bad weather. The port into which he had the choice of going appeared to be full of shoals, and to have but one entrance. He was, therefore, obliged, most unwillingly, to come t the conclusion that it would be imprudent to take his ships into that port. He had no means of knowing that an open passage existed through which the Russian ships could escape, and he naturally concluded that they could onlygetouttowardsthesonth. The right hon. gentlem ansaid ho was wrong in not remaining opposite the port after he had sent away the Bittern, but it would have been impossible for him to do so in consequence of the alternate gales of wind and fogs. All these gales blew from the south, so that if he had attempted to lie off the port he would have been thrown to the north, leaving the whole Gulf of Tartary open to the Russians. On the other hand, brcomg ito the south, and cruising backwards and forwar in t e narrowest part of the gulf, he was pretty sure of intercepting them, as he imagined that if they went to the north they would get into a cul-de-sac. Finding that they did not come out towards the south, he went back to Bse Castries Bay, and, discovering that they were no longer there, he naturally arrived at the conclusion that they had gone northward, andhe expected that, on the arrival of the reinforcements he had sent for, they would immediately be pursued. He (Mr. Eliot) could not form any opinion as to the causes which had detaied the admiral, but it was certain that he was detained for some time, and that when he arrived in the Gulf of Tartry he thought it would not be right to proceed any further northward. Captain Elliot being under the admiral's orders could do notIing but proceed to the northern part of the gr and endeavour to discover what had become of the uians; but when he arrived there the weather was so bad that it was impossible for him to carry on any operations, and he returned. The admiral, after remaining for some time, determined to go back to the south. Captain Eliot could have done nothing better than he did, for, not being able to get into the bay and fight the enemy, he endeavoured to intercept them as they came out, and if his information had been correct his plan would have been entirely successful. Even at last they would probably have be en captured if the admiral had proceeded northward, but from the state of the weather, or from some other cause, he did not think proper to do so. The subject had not been brought before the House in a fair manner, but if any further inquiry took place he had no doubt that it would clear Captain Elliot's character from all the imputations which had been cast upon it. THE BUNHILL-FIELDS BURflG-GROuxD. Mr. MIALL asked the lUnder-Secretary for the Home Department whether his attention had been called to the fact that arrangements were being made and notices served for the removal of the remains of persons buried in the late Bunlmill-fields burying-ground, Church-street, Islington, and for using the ground for building purposes; and whether such proceedings were in accordance with law? Mr. MASSEY said that, two years ago, information was given to the Home Secretary that notices had been served upon the owners of private vaults and graves in the Bunhillfields ground to remove the remains of their friends, as the ground was about to be appropriated for building purposes. In order to ptastop to such a gross indeececy, the Solidtor to thel l'e ry was instructed to warnathe personawho had served those notices that he would be prosecuted if he peevered in his intention. This warning appeared to have the desired effect, but about two days ago a representation was made to the Home-office that similar notices had again been issued. No doubt such notices were iegal at common law (hear), and rendered the person who issued them liable to an indictment for misdemeanour. Inquiry should be made into the facts, and, if necessary, the law should be put in motion. (Hear, hear.) THE ECCLESIASTICAL AND THE CHURCH ES- TATES COIMMISSIONS. Lord R. CECIL asked whether Her Majesty's Government proposed to act upon the intentions intimated on the 15th of July, last year, by the Home Secretary of institutin;an miqmry into the working of the Ecclesiastical Commussion and the Church Estates Commission ? Sir G. GREY said, he did propose that some inquiry on the subject should be conducted by a committee of that House, and he would give notice of the motion for a commnittee in a few days. PATRONAGE IN DOCKYARDS. lord HOTHAM asked whether there would be any obection to lay on the table a copy of the recent order or regulation, by which the patronage of all appointments in their respective dockyards was given to the admirals and captains superintendent? Sir C. WOOD said he had no objection. OUR RELATIONS WIT AMERICA. Mr. COBDEN then rose to ask for explanations from the Government for the non-production of the correspondence respecting our relations with America. He said,-I ask for these explanations because the answer given by the noble lord at the head of the Government to my inquiry the other night does not appEar, for reasons I shall explain, founded exactly infact. I aslste -noblo lord whether there would be any objection to won the table of the house the correspondence respecting our present relations with America? The noble lord stated, in reply, that the correspondence in neither of the cases to which my inquiry referred vas quite completed, and on that ground he refused my appeaL Now, in order to make my observations the more readily intelligible, I must premise that unhappily, there are two subjects of dispute existing at the present moment, and involving very serious and grave considerations between this country and America. One has reference to the Central American question of 1850. The House is aware' though the country, perhaps, is not, that in IS0 the English and American Governments entered into a convention,. most benign in its object and somewhat novel in its chac racter, for the purpose of guaranteeing the construction of a canal across the Isthmus of Darien. The convention begins by expressing a hope rnd desire that it mnight havo the effect, among other things, of promoting peace and amity between the contracting Powers, and civilization throughout the world. The object of tho convention was to enable parties to construct a ship canal through the narrow isthmus of Central America under a specific guarantee from the contracting Powers. The convention was intended to bo elastic in its operation, for the contracting Powers contemplated inviting other Powers to join in tho guarantee. Among other things it was: provided that, in case of war ships passing through this canal, or being withina certain distancoe of its entrance, should not be subject to eapture or molestation. History scarcely presented an example of a convention being entered into for objects more commanding approbation. The convention was agreed to in 1850, but owing to the unfortunate propensity of diplomatists to involve their sentences in phraseology which becomes unintelligible not only to others but to themselves, it. seemed likely to be the cause of very serious qurel betvesn the two countries. His hon. friend the member for DMfies had proposed in this house that there ahouldbeau examination of candidates for service in the diplomatic career, an I would suggestb him to require one qualification-namelyJ that they should be able to wzito piga Im4 igaljivjb English. In the present case this unfortunate disagree. _m _ to:s= L ' a m uore unaooountable -becoumse both the diplomatists spoke tho same language, whereas, had it been a convention betwmeen German and an Englishman or a Frenchman and an Englishman, there might have been some excuse for the misunderstand. ing. From 18G0 down to October in last year this convention had been tho subject of correspondence between this country and the United States; and in October of last year. a letter vritten by Mr. Buchanan to Lord Clarendon closed the correspondence, and in December, on the meeting of Congress, the correspondence, so far as it relates to the Ameriean side of the controversy, was laid on the table of Congress; and I mention this, because the noble lord, says that the correspondence is not complete. I wish to separate this subject from that of the enlistment, in respect to which we are unfortunately involved in a dispute with America, and I hope the noble lord will give an answer in reference to this subject as distinct from the other. 'We have the correspondence published in the United States; it has also been published in England, and I hold in my hand a pamnphlet containing it, published and purchaseable in London for about Is. Nevertheless I cannot quote this cor respondence, though it is discussed in the nerw' papers and made a topic of conversation in private. 1 can only bring forward a motion founded on documents beforeParliament. The answer given to my question the other night by the noble lord was, that this correspondence was not complete; but ho mnust have been in error in making that statement, because Lord Clareadon in September, 1855, in his last letter to Mr. Buchanan on the subject, uses these words "Her Majesty's Government had, indeed, refrained from pung the dicussion by replying to Mr. Buchanan's note of the 22d of July, 1854, b use it appeared to them that the continuation of the correspondence was not likely to lead to an- -atisfactory conclusion; and, as Her Majesty's Ministers air still of that opinion, the undersigned vill confine his answer to Mr. Buchanan's present note within the same limits as those which Mr. Buchanan has prescribed to himsel1f."1 Mr. Buchanan also, in last October, assents to Lord Clarendon's statemernt that thD correspondence is concluded, He says:- "While far from intending to renew the general discussion of these questions, which has already been exhausted, the undersigned, in passing, would mace a single observation, &c." A Moreover, it was 3Er. Clayton himself, a party to the treaty, who in moving, in the Armerican Senate, that the papers should be printed, stated that the cerrespondence was concluded. If I wanted a conclusive proof that the correspondence was ended, I should find it in the fact stated by Lord Clarendon in the House of Lords, that the subject matter of dispute had been offered to be referred to arbitration, thus plainly admitting that the discussion is absolutely at an end. I, therefore, think that this House ought not to be wholly unacquainted with the nature of that correspondence, and I hope that the noble lord will no. object to its production, or, if he does, that he wi give some other ground for his objection than that alleged the other night. The other dispute is one of more recent date, Last year we sent emissaries to America to enlist men for our Foreign Legion. Now, I should like to know who were those wise individuals who, sitting in couw cil, and feeling a great want of men to fight this battle which we were told England was able to fight against all the world, sent to the United States for men to fight against the Russians. Why, the stream of human labour going from the East to the West every year amounts to 300,000 or 400,000 human beings. We ourselves send from 50,000 to 100,000 men annually to America, to seek their fortune by the superior remuneration of labour, and I should have thought it as likely to have rolled back the seasons or to have turned the river in its course as to send to the United States to find ablebodied men, where they are earning 4s. or 5s. a-day ecah, to fight for us in a semi-barbarous region for about Is. a-day. It was so absurd and foolish a project that I should like to know who are the parties responsible for it. We have no correspondence published on this subject, either here or in America; therefore I only go on common rumour and on what was admitted by Lord Clarendon in another place. It seems that on remonstrance from the United States, we admitted our error and countermanded our orders, withdrawing our enlstment estabIlshments not onlyfromtheflnited States, butfromour ownNorth American colonies. Inthisrespect our amncde and apologyweremost honourable. I do not know the terms of the apology, but I am told that the apology, when made, was considered satisfactory. But I am told that after that another transaction took place, not in violation of American law, but in evasion of it, which has reopened the grievince. I do nbt know how this is, for we have no official informa. tion before us, and I only state what I am giveu to understand is the fact. All I wish to point out to the House is. that our Government has admitted itself to be in error. We are in the wrong, and, when we have admitted that to be the case, whether we make reparation in one form or another does not appear to me to be of any great importance. If you tread on a man's toes, it does not very much matter whether you say to him, "I beg your pardon," or "Ibeg ten thou. sand pardons." That never would be a point on which any sensible men would go out to fight. Let it be borne inmind, then, that we are, by the confession of our own Government, in the wrong, and, as we stanid responsible in the name Oi the country for the acts of our Government, I think it would be well [if we had this correspondence laid before us, even if it be not completed; and for this reason-I am inclined to suspect that this question has assumed very much of a personal character, that it has been envenomed and embittered in the course of the protracted correspondence; and I think, therefore, that if it were taken away from the Foreign-office, and discussed in the country or in this house, there would be displayed such a magnanimous feeling on the part of the people and of the members of this House that the quarrel wonldbe at once put a stop to. There has been a talk of arbitration in the other subject of dispute, and I beieve we should find some such mode of settling this question in the most honourable and satisfactory manner. In private life, in quarrels on matters of etiquette, it is not the usual course for the person who has committed the wrong to fix the reparation. Seconds are called in, and they decide what shall be the apology to be made; and, if this question were brought before the House, I have no doubt we should find out a means of escaping from the difficulty. Besides, the country would be much more at ease if the subject were discussed by us, and there would be an end to that alarm and apprehension which now exists among the mercamtile community lest every fresh packet should bring intelligence that Mr. Crampton has received his passports and is on his way home. At all events, I am quite sure that nothing will be gained by allowing these matters to remain veiled in the secresy of the Foreign-office. We have got into one war by the system of secret diplomacy, and we may get into another in the same way. "W here there is darkness there is danger" is as true in politics as in the material world. This second dispute aboat our attempts at enlstment, be it remembered, is more imminent than the first. I do not know whether the noble lord intends to lay before us the papers relating to this part of the subiect ; but if he refuses, on the ground that the correspondence is not completed I am at a loss to see how we are ever to get any more papers on any subject, for it was only last night that he declined to produce the papers relating to the case of Mr. Curtis, our consul at Cologne, on the ground that the correspondence was closed and the whole matter finally settled. If he now refuses to give us these papers on the ground that they are not completed, he will invest himself with the entire responsibility ; for if we are not to have the correspondence, either before or after it is finished, what hold can the country have upon the noble lord and his Government? This question of our relations with the United States-would, I think-, be much safer in the hands of the people mad of this House, than of the Government or of the press. I there be a war between us and the United States, it will not be a war upon which the people wi enter with a willing spirit; if there be a collision, it wil be provoked either by secret diplomacy or by the exasperating language of the press of this country. - What has been the language of the Ministerial journals on this subject? Almost the first thing we heard of this dispute was from an article in 1ic Times newspaper in November, which told us, to our astonishment, that we were ready to go to war with Amenica, but that we should stil "Hold our hand on the throat of the Northern despot." Within the olst fortnight, too, Ihave seen similar language inthe AtorningPostsand mne Times, which are thejournals supposed to represent the opinions of the Ministry. I must say, though I have watched the anguago of the American journals with considerable in. terest, I have seen no such language in them as has ap. peared in V7ie Tiszei and the Morning Post. True, the journals of England generally have not taken that hostle course, but those journals which represent the Cabinet will be taken in America to represent a laie portion of our people. Ia aanxious, therefore, that we should not bethe only persons in the country who are not to discuss this subject. I desire that we should be, in fact, the pulse of the nation in this question, as we are on any domestic question in which the people feel interested. I can hardly view as possible so great a calamity, to both countries and to the world, as a hostile collision between England and the United States (hear, hear), amd yet we are talking about it daily in the pross, we are Speculating about it in private, and the Government, in their correspondence, is bringing us to a deadlock which will take away all chance of escape. A warbetween this country and America, onwhichever side sccess might rest, would be the most horrible, the most inhuman calamity, even to the VIvr1 'WhIv (o1d possibly SaPPoI Wore we to sucnd it would be very much like destroying our own ofpring, a*l, were America to crush Englsaid, it would be litUe better than parricide. I hope, therefore, that we shill not be afraid to approach this question, that we shal' not refue to understaLnd what it iswe are quarrelling about, but that we shall call for the papers and shall show the coun try that we are prepared to deal fearlessly iad honet with the issue which may be laid before us. (Hear, hear.) Lord PAIERSTON.-In answering the hon, member, I shall observe that distinction between the two questions involved in this matter which he has himse drawn, and which he has recommended to me. And first, then, I will deal with the question of Central America. The hon. gentleman is perfectly correct in saying that the treaty of 1850 ws a treaty honourable to both paties, and which had in view objects that could only conduce to the improvement of commere and the extension of civilization in every part of the world. It is well 'known that greatinterest was excited upon the subject of the opening of a ship canal through the Isthmus of Darien between the Atlantic and the Pacific. Jealousies grew up between England and the United Siatesj each supposing that the other had some exclusive object in view, and meant by some means or other to establish itself to the prejudice of the other, either at one end or other of the canaL The object of the treaty concluded by my right hon. friend Sir H. Bulwer with Mr. Clayton was to remove all possible cause of jealousyuponthatpoint, andtheproaisions of that treaty were calculated to accomplish that end. The project of cutting a ship canal between the two oceans has, however, been found liable to physical difficultie3 'which there is not much chance of overcoming, and practically, therefore, that part of the arrangement has ceaod to have any immediate application. But there were further provisions in that treaty, by which, in order entirely to do away With the jealousies which each of the two countries entertained of the views of the other, both countries disclaimed any intention to appropriateanyterritory in Central America, or to colonize or obtain any possessions therein. There v.s au exception made however, with respect to pos. sessions which we hadalready there-Belize and its depen*lencies-and with respect to certain duties of pro'ection which had been performed by us for n long cours of time, and which were at that moment ex:sting. I do not think myself that the t:eaty is liable at all to the eriticism which the hon. gentleman has passed on it. It seems to me that the words of the treaty are plain and its meaning perfectly obvious, and I realy do not see that any other con. struction but that which we contend for can be p;t upon it. The treaty was prospective, and not retrospective in its operation. At the same time the American Government has endeavoured to establish a different construction, and a long correspondence has taken place between the two Governments on the subject. We contend for our construction and the American Minister contends for a different one. We have stated, however, that notwithstanding that we are perfectly convinced that our interpretation is the just one, we are ready to submit the question to the arbitration of any third Power. (Hear, hear.) To that offer we have not yet been able to obtain an answer, and so the question now stands. I did say, the other day, in answer to the hon. member, that I did not think thecorrespondence sufficiently closed to be laid before Parliament, but upon referring to the state of the corre spondence I feel that we shall be perfectly prepared to produce it, and I am quite ready to lay it on the table at once. (Hear, bear.) It is not techni. caOly closed, but I think it is sufficiently dosed to be laid before Parliament for the purpose of showing what are the views of the two Governments on the points at issue. The other subject of dispute relates to our Foreign Legion. When the act was passed, a little more than a year age, which enabled the Crown to enlist foreigners, it was represented to Her Majesty's Government that there were in the United States a considerable number of Germans who might be disposed to enlist in the military service of this country. The hon. member seems to think it a moral and political absurdity to expect that the tide of emigration which has been setting from iEast to West can, with regard to individuals, turn back and ilow from West to Fast; hut he must know, or at least he ought to know, that in point o£ fact that ebb of the tidehas already commenced (hear, hear), and that, inDregard to Ireland, hardly a month or a week passes that a certain number of individuals who have emigrated to the United Statesdonotreturn totheirnativeland, eitherhavingnamAssedwhattheyconsidera competency, or, en theotherhand,havingbeendisappointedintheirexpectatio,s It was not for us to judge beforehand whether any considerable number of Germans would be wiling to enlst, and orders were therefore given to establish a recruiting depat within our provinces, with instructions that any persons capable of service who might present themselveB for enlistment should be enrolled. At the same time strict and specific orders were given that nothing should be-done which should infringe the municipal regulations of the States or violate tne law of the Union. Severalhundreds of Germans went to Halifax and enlisted, and some of them are now in this country. Her Majesty's Government, however, very soon found that it would be exceedingly difficult in carrying on this enlstment to avoid that which might cause offence to the American Government;. and, being most anxious that nothing should occur which -could give umbrage to the United States, we issued orders that these proceedings should be entirely discontinued, (Hear, hear.) SOOn afterwards an official representatior was made by the Government of America, complaining oE the enlistment. The answer given to that was that, anticipating that they might take umbrage at the proceedings which bad been commenced, Her Mjestys Government had of their own accord ordered that they should be discontinued. In giving this answer we expressed our regret for anything which might, contrary to our intentions and instructions, have been done in violation of their laws, thouglL we were disposed to think that no such violation bad occurred; and referred, as a proof of the sincerity of such regret, to the fact that we had of our own accord stoppea the proceedings of which the American Government complained. (Cheers) The hon. gentleman (M1r. Cobden) has said, thatthe relations of Governments shouldbereguatedby thoserules which apply tothe conduct of gentlemen towards eachother; and Iwouldask, whatcouldbe moresati5factoryas between gentleman and gentleman than that one should say to the other, "I thought I foresaw that what my servantk were doing might give you reason for complaint, I Lave stopped their proceedings; but, nevertheless, if they have, contrary to my instructions, done anything with which yoe have reason to find fault, I beg your pardon; I am very sorry for it, and express my regret P1 (Cheers.) - When the communication to which I have referred was made to the American Ministerin London, he expressed hiaself satisfied with the explanation (cheers), and said that he felt confident that his Government would entertain a similar feeling in regard to it. Yor some time we heard nothing more. Subsequently, however, complaints were renewed, the question was reopened, and a correspondence has gone on upon this subject. Three days before that on which Parliament met I thought that -we sholda be able to lay that correspondence on the table of the house. There wasnothing init which we could wish to conceal; on tho contrary, we were anious that it should bein the hands of members. On the very day before the meeting of Parlia. ment, the American Minister presented to my noble friend Lord Clarendon an exceedingly voluminous despatch, containing a long recital of circumstances alleged to have occurred in connexion with this enlistment. My noble friend felt that it would be impossible to answer that despatch in a manner consistent with the respect which ought to be shown to the Government of America, and with a due regard to the character of the British Government, without referring to Her Majesty's Mnister at Washington for a report upon a variety of minute details, upon which the information possessed by the Foreign-office was imperfect. This cirenrastanea has necessarily delayed the reply to the last despatch of the American Government; and the matter therefore stands thus :-If the correspondence were to be produced now, it would end uith a long paper from the United Stat-es Govern. ment, to which no answer has yet been given, because the materials on which such answer must be founded have 35t yet been received. (Cheers.) It would not be fair to the American Government to omit from the correpondence this last paper, which they would not have sent hal they not considered it an important one; and, on the other and, it would not be fair to the British Government to gve that statement without giviNg alsothe reply to it. (Hear, hear. I hope that no long period of time will elapse before we ar able to close the correspondence by giving a answer to that paper; and I can assure the lion. SentlemaR and the IHouse that, when that has been done, we shall be most ready and most anxious to lay the papers upon the table. (Cheers) I quite agr with the hon. member that this matter is of -the utmt importance in its bearing upon the interets Df the two countries. Ifo llyconcur with hinmin thin Icagtlatt thr could hardly be any conflict between two ains whic would bemorelamentaibleand calamitousto both tbA wod be a contest between ourselves and the people of -Aerita.

SURREY THEATRE. A good tliorough-going melodrama-we do not mean a " dranmc," in the French sense of the word, with its acts neatly rounded off and its changes of scene reduced to a 1ninimut) but one of those long stage-told tales of adventure that takes a hero through a whole chronicle of events, and perpetually varies the p lace of action,-such a wrork, we say, mlay be found occasionally refreshing, now our nsual dramatic notions are more formal than they were 30 years ago. We may not always be quite clear as to the position of every link in the chain of incidents, and if we were caUed on to explain how a gentleman vwho w as involved in an apparently inextricable difficlty in one scene appeared quite unembarrassed in another, we might be puzzled not a little. Nevertheless, when we know that some sort of danger is followed by some sort of escape, to be foulowed by a new danger in its turn, and that danger and escape will go on succeeding each other until the invention of the author is fairly worn out-we know quite enough to keep us in a state of agrecable excitement, provided the successive scrapes scrape snfficiently on the fcelings. Now, there is a very good specimen of what we may call the " string of adventures" school of drama now enacting at the Surrey Theatre. It is called ,Siadoews of Cnime-why, we canmot precisely say, for the crime committed by the wicked personages is substantial enough in all conscience. However, be that as it may, the hero of the tale is a noble, fearless, devil-daring gentleman, named De Moleville, who flourishes in the midst of the " Beign of Terror," proud to show that it is without terrors for him. An Engiish lady wishes to escape from France, and finds a stoppage at every ssible place where passports require to be risvd, but she Z uckly, afriendm the ubiquitousfDe Xloleville, who has a fresh costume to baffle pursuers at each successive barrier and leaves us in doubt whether courage or shrewdness is his preponderatingquality. When he has seenthe lady quit the coast in a fishing smack, one might think that his occupation was over. Bnt, no. There is- fresh work for him to do. The lady has left her daughter and her jewels under the care of a faithful servant, and the servant, taking up her abode at an- unlucky lodging, has been poisoned for the sake of her money, while tse child has been turned into the street. It is therefore the bounden duty of De MoleviUle to discover the child, and, when the crime is discovered likewvise, to bring the criminal to justice. Of course he succeeds. What conld stop De 2IioleviUe ? poice spy recognises hunin the street as a personage proscribed by the Government pr o ten., but a knock on the bead stops tho intruder's vigilance. Jean 21arat is his enemy, but he scales Jean *arat's wall, and, knife in hand, compels that illustrious patriot to grant him a free pardon. !Poor Jean thiks to be even with his adversary by issuing afreshvwarrant for his arrest, but he little knowshowfortne, who proverbialy favours the bold, especialy favours the daring De ldoleville. The warrant is dur served, but nottillthe hand of Charlotte Corday has rendered it null and void. At last, after years of this sort of thing (for the ad ventures we dimly hint at occupy years, not days), DeMole. vile has -the satisfaction of seeing the wicked-poisoner shot on the top of a roof while endeavouring to See from justice, and fall to such-a -depth that the audience-startat the spectacle. : This brief and, we fear, somewhat obscure narrative, will givebut afaint idea of thejoys and terrors awakenedLby the Shado7cs of Crimn4 but it will serve to indicate the-existence of something very exciting. Mdr. Creswick. as -the wonderworking De Moleville, with almost as )nany dresses as he has speeches to deliver, acts and looks the part to per. fection, giving by his daring appearance andmllanner an air of vraiseilonce to incidents that can scarcely be called probable, while to relx -themiind o the sectatorIrom the tnsion occasioned by " powerful-interestft there is the inexhaustible humour of 1fr.

MOBY-MARKE Tatl CITY INT SLLIGENCE. Friday Evening The English funds havo again been firm to-day, and have closed at an advance of an eighth on the prices of last evening. Consols for money, which then left off at 91i, were first quoted 91 to J. From this they went to 91g, but the final bargains were at 913 to J for money, and 91 to ifor the 11th of March. The transactions of the day were not important, but, owing to anticipations of a very favourable Bank return, there .was a gencral tendency to improvement, which was checked only by the pressure for money. The demand in the Stock-Exchange is still maintained, and in the discount-marLet nothing is dono below the Bank rates. Bank Stock closed at 212k to 214; Reduced, 911 to BE; Nevr Three per Cents., 92k to i-; Long Annuities, 3k; Annuities, 1885, 16 11-18; India Stock, 223 to 225; Exchequer-bonds, 97- to 98; and India-bond5 and Exchequer-bills, 7's. to 2s. discount. The transactions in foreign securities were not extensive, but prices showed in some cases a slight improvement. Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, were negotiated at 92k, 93k, 92}, and 93. In the Four per Cent. Guaranteed Stock the opera. tions were at 100 101, and 100ga. The general bargains comprlsed-Brazilian FiLve per Cents., 101 ; Mfexican, for money, 20k; for the account, 20k; Russian Five per Cents., 105 and 104; the Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 93- Sardinian Fivo per Cents., for the account, 89k; Apanish Threeoper Cents., for the account, 42- and 43 ; the New be ferred, for account, 241 and 23k; Pawsive, Q0k; and Belgian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 95. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon bills upon Paris were offered, and the rato was more favourable for this country. Amsterdam and Hamburg were also slightly higher than last post. The corn-market was steady this morning at the decline of Monday. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a fair business, but with a tendency at the close towards diminished firmness. The closing quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 72f. for money and 7 2f. 80c. for the end of the month, showing a decline of more than a quarter per cent. in the former case, but no alteration in the latter. At Vienna there are still symptons of reaction froni the late rise, and at Amsterdam the stock-market remains inactive. The continental letters to-day mention that at all the principal cities the rates of exchange on London present a very firm appearance. At Hiamburg there is an increased demand for money, and the rate of discount has returned to 5 per cent. The prospectus has been issuedof an undertaking, with limited liability, to be called the National Discount Company. Theproposedcapitalisl,000,0001. in shares of 251., and the list of directors is composed of business names. The transactions of the conmpany are to be of a similar character to those of the existilg dlscount houses, and it is not to act in any res ect as a bank. ltie colonial produce-markets during the week there has been only a moderate amount of business, and prices are in most instances agpin lower. The sugar-market opened very flatly, and the home trade evince no disposition to operate to any extent. Exporters, however, and especially the Grcek finns, have been buying freely both raw and refined, a considerable portion of the latter being for the Mediterranean, and perhaps also for the Baltic, if it can be got in during the armistice. Prices generally have fallen ls. 6d. to 2s. per cwt., except for the common brown kinds of Mauritius, w hich are taken for shipment, an6realize about previous quotations. Privately somc business has been done on the spot, and writh regard to cargoes afloat such transactions as have taken place indiiate a diference in price of 2s. 3d. per cwt. in favouv of those for the continent. The tea-market is aso very dul for nearly al descriptions. There ax" no buyers of i conunon congou even at a reductioh. Coffee is 1 quiet, at former prices. For plantation Ceylon, I owving to its having been very sparingly hrought forward, full terms were obtained. Large (pantities of Mlocla have been offered and chiefly boup'L in. Very considerable transactions have occuirred in run, at a fall of 3d to 4d. per gallon. WVith the exception of one large parcel sold at the begiining of the week, nothing of moment has been done in rice. Saltpetre has again been sold at a decline. The imdigo quarterly sales are declared for Tuesday next, and 9,000 chests are advertised. letters from Constantinople mention that telegraphic despatches intended for Turkey should be addressed to the Governor of Giuro-evo, on the Danube, who wil forward them to thcir destination. The last accounts from Australia with regard to the opening of the River Murray state that the steamer Albury (Cadell's line) had safely reached Albury on the 2d of October, from the Goolwa-a distance exceeding 1,900 miles. The actual time under steam was 270 hours, being an average speed of about seven niles per hour. Her airival at Albury caused a great revolution in the price of all those imported articles of which she brought supplies. The charge fLxed for freight between Adelaide and Albury was 301. per ton for heavy goods anld 451. for light. The steamer Gundagai was nearly completed, and Captain Cadell expected soon to take her upto Gundagai, on the Murrumbidgeea point equally distant with Albiiry from the mouth of the h7UTaY. The water was higher than during the previous year, and the advantages to the three colonies from the development thus being effected of their interior resources seeln almost incapable of being over-estimated. The prospectus has been issued of a Great Yarmouth Fishery Company, with a capital of 30,0001. in 101. shares. Its object is to prosecute on an extended scale the herring and mackerel fisheries at that place. The amount paid into the treasury of the East India-house for bills on India from the 23d of January to the 8th of February was 134,8811. The return from the Bank of England for the week ending the 2d of February gives the following results wvnen comparedwith the previous week:Public deposits ... ... £3,782,879 ... Increase .£518,676 Otherdeposits ... ... 13,807,258. 1ncrease 93 ,7D5 Rest ... ... 3,410,082.I[nncreaso 33,450 On the other side of the account:- Government securities... £2,092.361 ...

I .. THE, TUBKISH CONTINGMYT. (FROM A CO RltF13A KE-TXTC, JAN. 15. There is a complete dearth of interest in the affairs of this part of the Crimea. Monotony-in the trus sense of the word-drags along its slowly creeping length day after day. The excitement consequent on the false reports circulated by Tartars of an immediate attack on Kertch has, with its concomitant disagreeables, passed away, togetherwith the changa of temperature from freezino to moderate. The weather is the only thing that affords any topic for conversation or exhibits the slightest shade of variety. Yet how sudden and great is this variety I No one unacquainted with Crimean weather could form an idea of its nature. Buta few days-I had al. most said hours-have elapsed since thebayof Kertclt and the Straits of Yenikale were one huge mass of ice, strong enough to beartheweight of guLns of heavy metal; and sledges, containing no small amount of humaan cargo, were driven alongside the ice-bound ships, oven as a carriago in Lndon draws up beside the footpath. The entire face of nature was veiled in snow, and the quicksilver in the thermometer generally ranged from 3 degrees to 20. The wind changed, and, as if by magic, ice and snow vanish, and we have April weather, with soft and genia! showers. The 12th of January was the very picture of a spring day. The sky equalled any that ever overspread the Italian shores; not even a white streak was to be observed to alloy the purity of the blue-the sea lay calm like an azure lake, and its waters, as they rippled on, seemed to sport in the laughing sunbeanms. Few are the April days in England that ever surpassed in loveliness the 12th of January in Kertch. Yet before this very sun had set all wvas changed, clouds came lowering on, the blue and cheery pky became dirty and sombre, and the day went out in driazllug showers. The following day was an exact representation of a dull November day in the great city, and ended in torrents of rain. Every place wav ankle-deep in thick tenacious mud, and orders were given to the various Turkish Contingent reuiments to scrape up the mud in the separate parts of the town occupied by each, but next morning frost reappeared and snow felL In the internal government of the town a great deal of good has been effected, marked by a decided diminution in the numbers of the intemperate. This may result from tle means of procuring drinl; having been in a great measure exhausted, but still a great deal is to be attributed to the orders and regulations-both civil and military-lately not only established, but strictly carried out. The shops are closed at an early hoiur, and any refractory publican is punished by the infliction of considerable fines. Some cases, of course, escape tlhe closest observation, but the improvement in several ways is marked and decided. Every comfort seems to flow about the Turkislt Contingent. When one speaks of campaigning, their condition can be termed almost luxurious. Those not housed in Rertch have been as comfortably accommodated outside in large good houses, well roofed, and covered with tarpaulings, witlh small cooking establishments in the rear, and their messes seem of a firt rate order, if one can judge from the savoury exhalations that issue from these cooking-houses about their feeding time. The hospital accommodation and arrangenments seem perfect, the amount of sickness not great, and I suspect that the doctors of the " Contingent " occasionally find it difficult to persuade some of their Turkisk patients that their cure is complete, and a further residence in the comfortable wards of the hospital unnecessary. The force at St. Paul's consists of nearly an entire regiment of French, about two regiments of Turks, and a small force of English artillery; and, thouglz their position is naturally exposed to the inclemency of the weather, yet, as they Vve built capital houses (far superior to any that could have beem supplied from a distance), made of timbers, tiles, iron sheets, windows, and doors, collected fiom the ruins of Kertch, they appear remarkably comfort. able. Seime of the smaller huts are covered with iron sheeting; others are built partly in the ground, and their roofs are covered with earth, which seems to answer the purpose of keeping out both cold and. wet. Vast improvements have been made on the roait zo St. Paul's, and over a small stream which joins the sea, about the comnmencement of the net road, the French have built a good stone bridge irt place of an old wooden one which existed in the. time of the Russians. Carved on the centre stone o£ the bridge are the words, "IVme Wagimeat d'Ia. fanterie de la Marine, 1855." The position of St. Paul's is considered as very strong both by nature and art, and critics pronounce the lines there to be superior to those made at Yenikale.

ZO2NDOWV, SA 2WDr, FEBBAP.Y 9, 1S56. The HIouse of Lords met yesterday at 5 o'clock.

PARKE a .new patent of ilstio1 with roemitnder to his heirs male. This wvuhl d ut ot etd to all agitation on the subject. T1't'o lP40 of DEsusa concurred in the suggestion, iudt trutstedlt it wvould be adopted, in order to avoid a eoutict on such a question as the prerogative of the Cuowzi. Tho Houso then adiourned In the House of Commons, on the motion that the Houise at its rising do adjoum until Monday, 3Mr. BAlnIE put certain questions to the First Lord of the Admiralty in reference to the conduct of Admiral STrm-G and Captain ELrIOT in the China Seas. Sir C. WVooD gave explanations of the proceedings of these officers with relation to the Russian squadron in the Gulf of Tartary, reading the reasons assigned by Captain Ehmor for the course he had puraued. Mr. ELLIOT justified the proceedings of Captain EL(IOT, contending that, under the circumstances, hecould not have acted otherwise than hedid act. Mr. COBDEN, in seeking for explanations from the Government for tlhe non-production of the correspondence respecting ouir relations with America, observed that there were, it was well known, two subjects of dispute-one with reference to the Central American (the BuTawEra and CLxrToN) convention of 1850, the correspondence respecting which, though declared by Lord PAnTrRsTox not to be complete, had been laid upon the table of the Senate of the United States; and from these documents, which had been published in London, it would appear, he said, that Lord CLRADoN himself had considered it complete. The other subject regarded enlistment intheUnited States; and in that transaction, which he characterized as absurd and foolish, it was admitted that we were in the wrong, and with respect to that matter he thought it would be better that the House should have the correspondence before it, even if it were not complete. He hoped, therefore, thatthepapers would be no longer withheld, in order that the House and the country might understand what we were quarrelling about. Lord PAiwRsTON- said that with reference to the first question, regarding the interpretation of the treaty of 1850, an offer-had been made by the British Government to refer it to arbitration, which had not been accepted, and upon looking over the correspondence he was ready to lay that portion of the papers before the House. With respect to the other question, concessions had bcen made by HIEB MahIxsrx's Government than which, he should have thought, as between gentleman and gentleman, nothing could be more satisfactory, and when made to the Amelican Mlinister here he had expressed himself satisfied, and felt assured that his Government would be equaUy content. The question, however, had been reopened, the correspondence had been going on, and just before the meeting of Parliament a voluminous despatch had been received from the American Government, to wlhich there had not been time to reply. He hoped that no long period would elapse before an answer would be sent to this despatcl, and then the Government would be most anxious to lay the whole matter before Parliament. Nothing, he added, would be wanting on the part of HIER M3JEsTys Government, with a due regard to the honour and character of the nation, to avoid a collision which would be a reproach to both countries. After a few words from Sir DE LAcv EVANS, the subject dropped, and the motion -was agreed to. The MIetropolitan Police Bill was read a third time and passed. On the order for the second reading of the Partnership Amendment Bill, Plr. Spoo.NER dissented from its principle, and insisted that it was not right that, when the law of partnership was to be so essentially altered, -the measure shoulld be hurried tlhrough the House. hIr. WAToSz heartily concurred in the principle of the bill, vhich he thought a sound one. He desired, however, that whatwas a "'sleeping partner" should be distinctly defined. MIr. AIUNTz believed that the measure wvould be a great delusion. Ir. CArs remarked that various suggestions made by him and others for the improvement of the bill of last session, and which had beeu then opposed by the Government, were adopted in this biil. MIr. 3MorrArT supported the bill, which he considered the complement of the repeal of the usury laws. 1Mr. T. BARnrN said, this bill introduced a great and experimental change in the mercantile law and usages of this coluntry, for vhich he saw no ne3-s sity. It was a novel experiment, withoat t1d test of experience. It was calculated to offer a aemium, I not upon credit, but upon fraud, separa4.ng management and capital; it wvould affect 4ne commercial reputation of this country, and - had not the approbation of the mercantile smmunity. Such a change was not wanted j,ze,- where there was no deficiency of capital; v aere profit could be gained, there w ould always bp capital. Sir W. CLKYr i-iieved that the country at large was in favour the bil, which would encourage the employrKent of capital and supply a protection to small:apita Not committing himself to details -e heartily supported the second reading. mIr. ARcuEsAl.D HIAS opposed the bill, as a total nange of our commercial law which would open a wide door to fraud. He denied that there was any deficiency of capital in the country; on the contrary, capital was redundant. The effect of the law of unlimited liability was to support the eredit of this country abroad, which this bill would in a great degree destroy. Mr. BTGGS supported the bill, which would afford, he said, facilities to rising talents in trade. He had known instances of the most painful kind, in which ruin and hopeless penury had resulted from the operation of the existing law. MIr. GLYN, not objecting to the principle of the bill, complained of the omission of the clauses introduced into that of last year as a security against the sudden withdrawal of capital. Without that security he was afraid the bill would open a door to fraud. After a few words from Mr. mhn'-S, MIr. CAPwxELL said, since the repeal of the usury laws it was natural to review the law of partnership. WVhen the bill came into committee the question would arise whether a contract between a ormantpartner and other partners was a matter which solely concerned them alone, or affected the interst rof the colmmercial community and the public likewise; inthe latter case registration and publiity ought to be provided for. Some remarks were made by MIr. PErJsi with reference to the Joint-Stock Companies BilL Mr. MITcHLL distinguished between money lent upon usury and advanced in partnership. MIr. Serieant Snxx admaitted that the law of partnership requiired change, but he feared the bill might lead to evils greater than those it proposed to remedy, by the withdrawal, for example, of capital from concerns where the lability was liniiie_ DMr. J. PHrrLmroRE considered the strong argument in favour of the bill to be that it aorded to. the humbler classes the means of employment for their capitaL Mlr. LAi-oG mid he should cheerfully vote for the principle of the bilL He recommended bTr. Lowi to endeavour to devise some further reatraint upon commerial frauds, the existing checks being, in his opinion, inadequate. M Ir. ML CHA5EBERS spoke in favour of the biL Mlr. Lowx, in reply to objections, said he was satisfied that all the frauds mentioned as likely to be I perpetrated under this bill were practised upon a very large scale under the present lw. Nolegislation could wholly prevent fraud, and a system of safeguards-such as registers-would be either a dead letter or would introduce a train of evils. The bill was then read a second time, as well as the Joint-Stock Companies Bill. The Burial of the Dead (Ireland) Billwas also read a second time. On the order for the second reading of the Youthful Offenders (Ireland) Bill, Mr. V. SCULLY urged the postponement of the. second reading, assigning reasons why Irish mem- ters should not be called upon then to assent to the principle of the bill. After some remarks by Mr. KinoDy, Mr. Hoxs5ur. objected to postpone this stage of the bill, the provisions of which were the same as those which the House had approved in the Eng. -Esh bill of last year. The details, however, mightbe discussed in committee. Mr. -MAOuuE made some observations, and the bil was read a second time. The House of Commons' OfficesBillpassedthrough committee. Sir W. CLAY obtained leave to bring in a bill for the abolition of church-rates. air. HEADLAn moved for leave to bring in a bill to amend the laws relating to the medical profession. He detailed the material provisions of the bill, which, he said, did not interfere with the right to obtain medical advice and assistance from any person whatever; but it sought to insure, first, equality of education throughout Great Britain and Ireland; second, reciprocity of practice; and, third, a general registration of legaly-qualified medical practitioners. He then explained the machinery by which the different provisions would be carried out, a prominent feature in the plan being the appointment of a medical council. The motion was seconded by Mr. BnADY. Lord P.T~mERSTON professed his readiness to give every assistance to the progress of the bill. The House adjourned at half-past 9 o'clock until MIonday.
Mlr. COBDEN at one time had a great reputation for fixing on the solid points of a question and taking a ground from which he could never be moved. Hence it was that they who did not like him could not answer him, and had to confess that the man whose tone of agitation was so disagreeable to them had, nevertheless, a great deal of truth on his side. Whether this was comparatively easy in questions of commerce and finance, or whether Mr. COBDEN does not see things so straight and so plain as he once did, certain it is that he did not last night touch the delicate subject of our relations with America with the same common sense and conscientious accuracy as he used to do the statistics of food. On the question of Cenitral America Mr. COBDEN at once conjectures that the disagreement has arisen simply from the unfortunate propensity of diplomatists to involve their sentences in unintelligible phraseology. To criticize by anticipation a document without quoting a word of it, and that merely from a certain opinion of the class from which it proceeds, is at all times rash and unfair. But in this instance Mr. COBDEx had the best reasons for Inowing that there must be something more than phraseology in fault, and that no possible clearness of style could have obviated the difficulty. The proof of this is in the fact that the British Government has absolutely given up the phraseology of the convention under dispute. Be that convention intelligible or not to the subscribers it matters not now, inasmuch as the British Government no longer stands to its own construction of the words. Entertaining no doubt as to their meaning, it nevertheless proposes to leave them to the interpretation of an umpire. Tho question, then, is no longer on any British construction of the words, or on any construction at all; but simply whether the Government of the United States will submit to arbitration, and surrender its pretension to give laws to the world. Our owvn Government has said, " Truth does not "permit us to concede that the words of the con"vention mean what we believe them not to "mean, but we are ready to let some one else say "what they mean." When this is the position in which we stand, and when the United States' Government is taking its time about tli' offer, it is not consistent with truth in Mr. COBDEN to say that the embarr-ssment arises from the bad style of the document, though, of course, it is a specieS of comment familiar enough to public men'ot a certain class. It must be added that even id his ellogy of the convention Mr. COBDZN hp- not been able to resist the temptation to sarcman, as if it were utterly impossible British di2pomacy could really do a good thing, or do it b,nestly and. simply. If any American agitator chooses to say that we volunteered an engage.ent professedly in the interest of all nations but really with fraudulent and sinister aiimp Of our oWn, MIr. COBDEFN has given him a %)ecies of countenance, whether he intends it or not. Having slurred over our offer of arbitration on the subject of one difficulty, Mr. COB=E proceeds to mak-e it the graramen of his accusation upon the other difficulty,-that we have not referred to "seconds" the form of the apology to be made. In fact, he passses over with contemptuous slight in the one case the very mode of proceeding which he professes to desiderate in the other. His suggestion of " seconds," however, does not apply to the second case. It is for the challenger to name his second, leaing us to name ours, if we place our cause in other hands than our own. The doctrine that he who confesses an error must not himself expect to fix the reparation is true enough; but, on the other hand, it is also true that he cannot leave that point to the offended party. Even humility has its limits, while there is no amount of abasement and damage which some people would not be ready to inflict on those from whom they have felt or fancied a wrong. MIr. CoBDEN has seen something of mankind, and he must be aware that consciousness of insult, desire of self-vindication, assertion of dignity, and thirst of revenge, are feelings apt to burn and swell into absolute monomanias. The weaker sort of imaginations will dream of slights and wrongs in order to indulge in the thought of reprisals. We have no reason to believe that the United States contain more minds of this morbid character than are to be found in other coantries, or that the statesmen of the Union are addicted to this self-indulgence; but. we must say that they' exceed all European nations in their appetite for apology. We should not feel ourselves safe if placed at their disposal as to the terms of the apology. Nay, they already demand what they are perfectly aware is more than an apology. Mr. COBDEN has seen nothing unpleasant in the journals of the I Union. According to him, their tone is gentle, pacific, modest, inoffensive, and all the rest, coinpared with what he finds in our columns. But is it either gentle, or pacific, or modest, or inoffensive to demand the recall of a Minister for an offence never intended to be done, and covered over and over again with apologies ? After all, will Mr. ! COBD stand to. his own test ? What will he say 1 if the Government of the United States persists in refusing an offer of arbitration on the affairs of Central Anerica? And, if one offer of arbitration is refused, how can we make another? It is evident that even that peculiar and powerful entity, " the people," as distinguished from Government, Parliament, and the Press, and in Mr. CoBDies mental vision opposed to them, can do nothing but mischief in the present stage of the affair. The American Government, it appears, launched a' huge missive against us in the shape of a voluminous narrative j3ist before the meeting of Parliament, and it is the turn of our Government and our Minister at Washington to reply. Anything, done at this moment to the prejudice of Mr. CPrrroN would have to be done over again, and the common justice of manldnd would resent a condemnation pamed while the accused was preparing his defence. When we have hadhis own answer to tho indictment so laboriouslydrawn up against him itwill be time to pro- nounce definitively on the extent of his crimes and the reparation we are prepared to make for them.- For our part, notwithstanding Mr. COBDEN'S evident suspicion that we want to get up an American war just to fil up the void made.X by the peace with Russia, we have no such imurderous desires. We are not such fireeaters as to wish for a war with the United Stares, sanguinary and wasteful as it might be beyond all precedent, unnatural as it would certainly be, and disastrous as it might be, very possibly. After our experience of the war just, as we hope, ended, and with honours and promotions showered on the conductors of it in the ratio of their demerits, we have no very encouraging anticipationsof success. All that we are certain of is, that we should inflict immense damage on the Americans, at the cost of great loss in blood, ships, and everything else to ourselves. That is nothing to hope for, and we do not hope for it. We are. as desirous of peace as Mr. COBDEN can be; but we know that when a nation becomes too proud to listen to reason the only appeal is to arms.
As the prospects of peaeo become more clear attention, both at home and abroad, reverts to those social improvements which chiefly distinguish the age. In the British Parliament domestic measures again receive the notice which 'was denied them in the turmoil of alternate disaster and triunmph; in the capital of the SuLTAN the representatives of Europe are engaged in legislating for the future condition of the Turkish empire. Even at a time when a new-borni admiration for the ruling race of those regions seemed to brind this nation to its corruptions and decay, we felt it a duty to point out that only by great and organic changes could the East be strengthened so as pernmanently to oppose a barrier to the aggressions of Russian policy. The state of govermnent and society there is now better understood than two years ago, when Turkey was an unknown land, 'which few had v-isited, fewer still had studied, and 'whici none seemed to have the courage to describe with impartiality and good faith. WVe all know the belief whiclh prevailed that al oppression by the dominant race was at an end, and that the Turks had adopte, with their European costume, European notions of justice and toleration. Those delusions are now dispelled. Every succeeding writer now tells more clearly of unchanged habits, of tyranny as wasting as before, of corruption still more universal, inasmuch as in every province the vices of the functionary have supervened on thoso of the barbarous feudal chief. WVe now know what a Pasha is, how a commander-in-chief will act, how armies are furnished with officers, andc by what means a man may creep to high rank and revel in unchecked plmuider. We have formed an idea of the Turkish genius for duplicity, and can comprehend how a Mussulman, with all the innate dignity so much admired, and with many a noble sentimenit on h-is lips, shall go to Erzeroum or Aleppo without a piastre and on a trifling salary, and yet return in three or four years %vith a fine fortiue. We can now underst;;nd how a firman can be issued, couched in the most solemn terms, and yet never be ohcyed, because every official throughout the cllpire knows it is not intended to be oboyed. The state of the Christians, their zabjection to the caprices and avarice of their rulers, their helplessness under tribunals wItere their evidence cannot be received, and the bitter hatred which makes themi the willirg tools of Russia, have of late been sufficiently d.scribed. It is impossible, therefore, not to hear with satisfaction that the European representatives at the PopR= are busy, and that the fourth point of the Austrian propositions is likely to be extended into a complete convention for the reconstruction of the social state of the Turidsh empire. It is said by our -c6rrespoiident, and every one who reads the details which he. furnishes will agree, that the Ambassadors have .asked for far more than they expect, in pursuance of the old policy of demanding much in order to obtain a little. Trily, such changes as they propose will amount to a total revolution in the habits and prejudices of more than a thousand years. That the Mussuhuan should be on an equality vwith the infidel is something which the ruler vill not easily be brought to inderstand, and even the downtrodden Rayalh of the provinces will hardly appreciate. The general principle of equality between Mussulman and non-AMussulman subjects wmill probably be developed into practice only 'where some European authority is on the spot, whom one party will fear and to whom the other will have confidence to appeal. That either a Mussulman or Rayah judge in the remoter provinces will do justice to those of the adverse religion, or that a court of mixed creed will ag,ree on any point where the fanaticism of its members is involved, is, in the present state of the Eastern races, almost hopeless; but, as we have seen many changes, and the inifluence of European residents every day increases, it may be hoped that before long travellers may record the unusual spectacle of a Cadi and a Bishop in council together, not to plunder the faithful whom they rule, but to combine conflicting codes and soften deeply-rooted prejudice, so as to arrive at something which is near to justice. An equally important principle, and one more easy to carry out in practice, is the appointment of Chlistians to civil and military posts. As far as regards the subject races, there can be no doubt of their anxiety for office, which in the East confers the only rank now acknowledged, and is, besides, a ready instrument for gaining wealth. As nine-tenths of the Turkish functionaries are now corrupt beyond all that Europeans can conceive, and destitute of the commonest education, it is impossible but that any change must be for the better. The Christians, whatever may be their moral condition, have yet of late years exerted themselves to elevate and instruct their children, and a generation has arisen educated in European capitals, and possessing at least the knowledge requisite for the fulfilment of the highest duties. UJnder awatchful tutelage, and by the exercise of a wise selection, we doubt not that numbers may be found capable of administeling with advantage the concerns of the empire. Yet it is most certain that if left to itself the PoRTE will employ none of these. The obstinacy of the Turkis not of the kind which stubbornly resists; it is of the most elastic material. The advisers of the SULTrAw, when forced by the representations of the allies, will assent to anything. France and England may consider: their work effected, and the close of the war the era of a -new civilization; but no sooner is the pressure withdrawn than the whole system of society reverts to its former shape. Not a Giaour will be admitted to any but the lowest offices, not a Mussulman buit will find intrigue and infamy, as before, effective for raising him to lucrative honours. The clauses which demand equal justice and an equal career for all will require the lasting watchfulness of the Western Powers if they are to be more than a mockery. As to the admission to military service, such a change is less likely to be appreciated by those whom it is proposed to elevate. But we think this is a point on which the allies should be firm, and establish at once a new principle. It is well known that a firman was published a year since commanding the extension of the conscription to the Christians in certain cases. This was felt to be merely a yielding to some diplomatic remonstrance; it was distasteful to the Rayahs and abhorrent to the Turks, and consequently nothing followed. A few wealthier Greeks and Armenians may desire a high military i conmmand, but none would aecept the lower grades of the army, much less such a lot as that of the Turldsh private soldier. But in any reconstruction of the empire the burdens as well as the privileges should be shared by all. If there be an army, let it be recruited from all classes and the followers of every creed. Here, again, the lasting interference of the contracting Powers will be necessary to success. Whether or not the reforms intended end in any great practical change, the attempt will at least have been meritorious, and not without its results. Although many of the stipulations may never be executed, yet the PouTz and its subjects will feel that oppression must at least be secret, and that to be secret it must not be general or intense. At any rate, there wiU be no excuse for another protectorate of the Christians. It is evident that the western nations will have done all that foreign Powers can do without the absolute subversibn of the SuLTA?'s rule. This rule Russia had always professed herself determined to maintain. She can, therefore, have no claim to assert that the condition of the Christians would bc advanced by her especial interference. But, though we rejoice at the prospect of this convention, to which circumstances and the common feeEng of Europe will urge the PoBTE, we must place far more confidence in the material changes which every day is producing. Already Constantinople is linked to Eiurope by the telegraph, her vast port is filled by the shipping of the western nations, the mines on the coast are not neglected, roadsand in course of time railways-wil give access to the rich interior, and the people have grown wealthy with Western gold, and are at length beginning to assert rights which no foreign Government has yet been able to obtain for thenL Such an amelioration is more solid and more enduring than any that is founded on the promises of a CounciL
DThe child of the fairy tale loclked in the strongroon by a wvicked old aunt, and told to unravel immense piles of tangled thread before dinner, was apparently not more helpless than he -who examines any of our ancient institutions to bring order and shapeliness out of the chaos which they now exhibit. Who shall codify our laws ? and, above all, to our present purpose, who shall make square our ecclesiastical laws and customs ? There is no good fairy to assist us ik;e that litte child; unfortunately, those now among us who can make everything fair and square in a moment are very bad fairies, whose order is revolutionary, who mistake destruetion for reform, "-who make a " solitlde and call it peace." Those who, like Lord BLA.NDFO D, w%ish to reform without subverting the ecclesiastical edifice, must be content with a very partial success, must give up all hope of attaining perfect symmetry of outline, must sacrifice unity for largeness of effect. It is of no use, because these irregularities cannot all be removed, to make unfavourable contrasts between the Church and the Dissenting communitiea that have sprung up in opposition or auxiliary to it; if ever these Dissenting bodies shall last as long as the Church of England, they will, no doubt, present as great anomalies; their revenues will be as confused, their regulations will be as inconsistent, their divisions will be as inapplicable to the wants of the time. It is the penalty of old age that destroys beauty, seams the brow, and wrinldes the cheek ; but, instead of exterior smoothness and curvilinear forms, brings misdom, experience, old memories, and indestrucetible associations. We do not want a Dutch symmetry-we do not want a Swiss neatness; if the Church were new to-day, adapted to all the wants and little habitudes of this present hour,-a prospectus advertised in our columns as if it were a mercantile association, its members andr office-bearers all duly appointed according to the latest fashion-it would before the year is out begin to be inapplicable to our wants. Of coiuse, we are speaking entirely of its external and temporary arrangements-not of its spiritual blessings and its unchangeable forms. Wealth increases here and decreases there; population passes to and fro ; precedents unaccountably arise. The Church requires new bishoprics; their revenues require adjustment; the clergy are not proportioned to the laity in different districts; their incomes, in very many cases, are not proportioned to their labours nor to their merits; the Ecclesiastical Courts get into confusion one with another, or are insufficient for the trial of offenders; and the Church has no power of legislating to remedy these deficiencies. "Time," it has been well said, " is the greatest "innovator of all"-here adding what was never expected, there destroying what had always been counted upon; and no reform (we do not say that individuals, but that a nation can devise and accept) is able to keep pace with these ceaseless innovations-not even the reforms of the last 25 years, great as these have been. That Lord B.nrFoBD is not satisfiel with these reforms, that in some respects he finds they have led to new abuses, and in many respects were extremely deficient, and that he invites the HomE SzCnPETAIAy to consider the subject, no one can wonder at who remembers the circumstances under wluch the reforms were inaugurated. "Down " with the Church" was the cry of one set of agitators, while another class took up the alarm, and determined all their votes by the one thought -" the Church in danger." Happily, that warcry has almost ceased to be heard; the radical elector does not ask the member who solicits his vote to pledge himself to do what he can to pay the national debt wvith the ecclesiastical revenues ; he seldom even asks his representative to confiscate the revenues of the Irish division of the Church; mob-orators do not utter tirades aggainst portly bishops and sneer at tleir apostoheal poverty; all the leaders of the Dissentinge, communities manage to fraternize on platforms with portions of our clergy, and, if they raise their voices against the establishment, confine their reproaches to individuals. Church-rates, it is true, are still a sore point, but they do not raise the question as to the disendowment of the Church, the abolition of prelacy, and the exorcism of thePrayer-book. Things have thus altered for the better, however, very much, because under the terror of such savage criticis3m many great and salutary reforms have been effected. In saying this we do not forget that the. better spirit with which the Church is regarded has a still deeper origin, in the greater earnestness of spirit which its ministers and people have shown; the clergy have as a class become more worthy of their high calling; they have done their duty with greater zeal; they have been multiplied so as to reach hundreds and thonsands of the population who previouasly never heard of the parson, save as the recipient of certain fees; they have, in a word, shown. themselves in true sympathy witli those sufferings which only the religion of sorrow can alleviate, and those wants which only heart can supply to heart. Yet, over and above this, internal imnprovement, great reforms have been forced on the Church by pressure from without. One of those grievances we shall immediately have to deal with in the matter of church-rates. Others have been eflected in regard to the episcopal revenues and the different eudowments that come under the tutelage of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. But it must be evidenit that nith bills, however admirable in intention, yet produced amid ftuious party clamour,- one section meaning destruction to the Church4und foisting in -ill-omened clauses, another section in terror for their sacred mother, and determtned at all hazards, if unable to defeat the measure, at. least to throw overboard this clause andc that one, -many mistakes must have been committed, abuses must have crept into practice, and the law ulti. r mately passed present some of the usual anomal lous features. Now, we trust that the British Legislature is to well disposed to the Church that it can proceed to examine in no spirit of opposition some of the t questions. that agitate the country; and a letter which ILord BDr.ximORD has just addressed to Siri GEoR-E GREY is peculiarly seasonable, as showing what the friends of the Church expect. He treats of the management of the episcopal revenues, the subdivision of parishes, the revenues applicable for parochial endowments, and the admiuistrative body required under existing circumstances for the Church. There is not one of these subjects that is not full of interest, and that does not require the attention of Government. Very different are the views of the members of the Church now from the views prevalent twenty years ago on these topics, We have begun with great difficulty to legislate on such Matters; the difficulty nowv is not to legislate. Every one has his scheme; this has been left -mdone, that also must be done in order to render complete what we have already attempted. A party has arisen within the Church which professes at least to regard its revenues -with indifference, and who wouild purchase the abolition of State interference by the sacrifice of State endowments. We shall be glad if, with a spirit of reverence to the sacred institution, the Government Will talke up the subject and see to the better management and distribution of the ecclesiastical revenues, at the same time enlarging and developing the Ecdle_ siastical Commission into a body -which may be safely intrusted with all the temporalities of the:"' Church. This Cormmission is only an expedientt k but we must be content -with expedients, and cannot in the present state of things expect that the outward array of the Church shall be as th6 sealdess robe of its divine Fou-xDEP.

MURDER BYS A CON CT.-PORTSMOUTR, Feb. 8.- This mornin a convct, named Jones, No. 1,246, stabbed Mlr. Charles William Hope, assistant-surgeon on board the Stirling Castle convict invalid hulk, in this harbour. Tho wound was inflicted in the neck by some sharp instrument, not discovered yet, and seems to have divided the jugular vein, causing death in a few minutes.. The prisoner seems to ave become desperate on the deceasedrefusing to certifythe necessity for his remaining in the lower deck, which is a sort of invalid ward, and wreal;ed h-s vengeance on him in the alery of the chapel, after leaving the surgery when he had been examined. Fromlanguage which he used afterwards to Mr. Williams, tho chief warder, it would seem he in. tended to murder him also, as he said, "If I could get at you rd serve you the ssme, you - villain P Mr. Sv,ainson, Admiralty coroner at Portsmouta, summoned an inquest of the most respectable tradesmen of Gospozt, of whom the Rev.

BESEFr SOCE S FOR RAILWAT W ORKA=.- On Tuesday there was a numerous meeting of the worknmen employed on the South-Eastern Railway, atthe school-room. at the Aishford-works, to bear an address from MIr. Smiles, the secretary of the company, on the advanges to be derived from the cultivation of provident and economi- habits. Mr. Smiles enforced his position by some Tery able aid convincing arguments. He said that every man ought to feel it a duty to cultivate his self-dependence and by ue economy of his means, often hardly enough earned, to endeavour to secure himself against the casualties of siclmessw accidents, or loss of employment. Prudence, forethought, and self-denial formed the basis of manly character and respectability. A man who laboured was worthyof allrespect -it was the idler who was undignified and useless. The pay of engine drivers was equal to that of lieutenants and assistant-surgeons in the army; and the remuneration paid to railway guards and stok-ers was equal to that of merchants' clerks and mnany Dissenting ministers. How to accountforthepresent disparityin the social position of the one class as compared withthe other? -It was in agreat measure to be accounted for by the difference in their education-thongh the improved institutions for the istruction of the people at large were tending graduallyto diminish the cause of inequality, and to bridge over the gulf whichdivided them. But it was mainly caused by the want of respect and proper ambition whicheveryworking man ought to cherish. Mr. Smiles proceeded to enforce uponworkinmenthe dutyof economy for the sake of the comfort of their households, and the education of their children, and urged their resort to benefit societies as a most praiseworthy combination for purposes of mutual help. Railway men ought most es y to ernploy forethought in order to be efficient or their worlk. Te best proof of their possessing such forethought would be that they should exercise forethought in matters relating to their own lives and circumstances. Railway work, by its very necessity, called for the exercise of the highest qualtiesinaiman-sohriety, punctuality, precision, watchfulness prudence, collectedness of mind, forethought. The railway worker in all ranks-platelayers, pointsmen, signalmen, guards, drivers and stolers, stationrmasters, and their staffs-must always be on the "look oiut." Uinreinitting vigilance on duty was as necessary to be observed by them as by the soldier in front of the enemy. Iu fact, the railway workmen, of all workmen, required to be the mnost couplete at all 'points-the most thoughtful and ready minded. When at was considered that not less tbas 90,000 mei were nor directly employed in the worlking of railways in this country, scattered abroad in stations and workshops at all points of the kingdom, the influence of their example upon the surrounding population must eventually be a matter of noslight importance to society at large. Such being the position of railway workmen, be enterained the expectation that in matters concerning their own social condition they would also exhibit a proper example of their wise and thoughtful arrangements. Mr. Snriles concluded by invit- ngthe assemblea worknmen to unite in the formation ofthemselvesinto a benef t society, a measure which iho diractors of the company waere most anxious to promote and encourage, provided it were based on sound principles. believing that it would promote the wellbeing of the 'iworkmen themselves, and secure the more efficient service of the railway. But while the directors were willing to give their liberal assistance they desired that the men should make the institution their own, as the were.the parties mainly interested in its prosperity.

8ECOND EDITION. T- THIN TIrES OFiFICE, Satiurday Mfornling. THE PEACE CONFERENCES. (BY Sn3UlS A!ND BBRXH mLM1GRAr.) Wre have received, the following telegrapbic despatch from our Paris correspondent - " PART9, SATURDAY, FIM 9, 8 A.R. ' The ?stoniteur announces that M. Massimo d'Azeglio had at first bceia designated by the Piednaontese Govemment to take part in the negotiations at Paxis, but that it learns to-day that Count Cavo-ar and the Marquis de Villaarina, the Sardinian MEnister at Paris, have been definitively appointed the Sardinian Plenipotentiaries to the Congress." TME EAST. We have received the following telegraphic deaatch from our M1arseilles correspondent - " 31ARSEMi:ES, SATuRDAY, FEB. 9, &20 A.3r. " The Carmel has arrived, with advices from Constantinople of the 31st, and from the Crimea of the 29th January. " Despatches leave at 9 a.m. " A Council assembled on the 29th at the English Ambassador's lasted till the following mornin-g. The principles put by the Ambassadors of the allies will lie approved by the Sititan to-morrow. 4" There is nothing new from the Crimea." EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris correspondent, dated yesterda-y, 6 p.m.:- A letter from Vienna, of the 5th, has the following remarks on the peace question "Complete accord exists between the allies of the 2d of December touching the peace stipulations. 'Jhis is now 3placed beyond doubt. I am happy to be able to announce that the 5th basis, wvlhii it Nvas generally supposed would become the stumbling-block to the approachingConferences, has only proved the perfect understanding between Austria and the Western Powvers on all points relative to the casus bdti. To give youn an example: the Court of Vienna has, without difficulty, admitted that in the interpretation of the 5th basis should be comprised the obligation of IRussia not to reconstruct the fortification of Bomarsund, as it is against the interest of Enrope that Russia should exercise too much pressure on Sweden by means of the Aland Iles. I have reason to think that it is this decision which prevents Pruassi from declaring in farour of the Western policy, though we must admit that the King gave his mnorel co-operation to t?e Austrian propositions. "I have already said that the Emperor Alexander did not completely approve the conduct of his Plenipotentiaries at the Vienna Conferences. He would have preferred a line of conduct inore conciliatory as regards the interpretation of the third guarantee, for if Prince Gortschakoff and 3r. de Titoff had better understood the spirit of their instructions eLnd had admitted the principle of neutralization of the Black Sea, peace might have been signed last year, and pro. ibably to that fact we owe it that neither of them is now named Plenipotentiary to Paris. The nomination of Baron Brunow is a favourable omen-inasmuch as he had from the beginning endeavoured to stop his Government in the fatal line it was pursuin. ICBaron de Bourqueney is maling his preparations to leave for Paris, where you may expect him on the 11th. Id. de Serre, First Secretary of Embassy, will act as Charge d'Affaires. "Count Buol leaves thison the 12th inst., and as he means to stop nowvhere on the way, vill probably arrive on the 16th. He takes with him Baron Neyssenburg, Aulic Councilior, who filed in the Austrian Foreign-office a post similar to that of Director of the Political Division in France. He had been long attached to the Austrian Emhassy at St. Petersburg. ML de Kletzi, who was attached for several years to the mission at Constantinople, and who is particuilarly acquainted wvith Eastern affairs, will also accoimpany M. BuoL. Id. Buhl goes as prisate secretary to the Plenipotentiaries, rith£ two other secretaries." The following private telegrapiic despatches have been received " I 7T}, EVEN-G. "The Vienna Gazette announces the pregnancy of the Empress. "M. de Bourqueney has left to-dy for Paris, and Count Beol-Schauenstein will leave for the same destination next week. " BERLIN, FEB. 7, EVE1sriG. " According to a despatch from St. Petersburg, Count Orloff has not yet left the Russian capital. " A deputation of Austrian officers, headed by General Parrot, has arrived at Warsaw to attend the funeral of Prince Paskeuitsch." "' TURIN', FsE. 8. "General delLa Idarmora has arrived here. " The Turkish Ambassador yesterday presented his letters of credence to the Eing. "The Senate has voted the loan of 30,000,000 by a majority of 50 to 7. "It is said that the Count Cavour will replace hd. d'Azegio at the Conferences." The foll;wing are obserrations made by a French military friend on the great question of the day, and whose opinion on such affairs has been often before the public - " It is cuions to study public opinion in France on this great question of peace. There is little doubt that, vwith the excep'tion of military men, peace is popuar-but not a peace such as that now proposed to be made. The satisfac. tion is not without the alloy of regret among the great majority of Frenchmen. They who are most eager, most impatient for peace at all price, are the Legitimists,-all whose sympathies have beenforalongtimnepast with Russia, and whose antipathies England is honoured with. The men of the school of Louis Pnilippe, who ill a greater number of public offices, and who compose in great part the official world, are also, as under the preceding reign, partisans of peace at any price. They desire only one thing-to cnjoy the advantages which they possess from their position. They tell you that France has acquired sufficient glory to be satisfied. But they forget that this glory, which beiongs to the nation, is somewhat counterbalanced by the blame which falls on the Government that has not succeeded in finding a great General, nor in imparting a better direction to the operations of the army. There is but one voice in France to blame the small fruit vwhich has been obtained from all our efforts, sacrifices, and bravery. In fact, the realpublic opinion in France, in so far as it can be known, is the same as that in Piedmont and in Sweden, namely, that it is unfortunate that our arms should bes laid down before the equilibrium of Europe by means of there-establishment of Poland is secured. One fact in particular gii7es great weight to that oDpinion, it is that, in spite of the denials of the Austrian Cabinet, it has sufficed to evoketlce shade of Poland to compel Russia to Lay downher armz, and to accept the propositions 'which are inposed on her. " Ineligent men in tiis country thinul that the Emperor has coimmittel a mistake in 3alowing this opportunity for acquiring zlory to pass away. He has had it in his power to change the snap of Europe, so badly arranged in 1815 from hatred to rrance, as if he was frizhtened by the grandeur of theprouect wlhici wvould be so gloriousforhim. He has ever, even duringthe war, allowed his desires to be limited by the treit.eS of 11.>, so odious tothis country, andhe willnot demarnI th:e execut,ion of theni in what concerzns Poland. One thing is clear, that the army ill retfrothe East dis-| satisfied with the manner in w1hich tho war has been conducted, and also with the creation ofthe Imperial Guard." A telegraphic despatch from 1Madrid, dated the 7th1, .y_ "'The proposition presented to the Cortes to fix at 110 reals (231.) the electoral qualification has been rejected by a majority of 103 to 101. It appears probable that A. Brril, the Miniter of Finance, will retire from the Cabinet." Ariother private telegraphic despatch, dated at a later hotur the same night, announces that M. Bruitl had positively quitted the Cabinet, and that last nitght his successor, Don Francisco Santa Gins, took the oaths as Minister of Finance, Santa Cruz was *linister of the Interior in a former Cabinet: he is not expected to maake a good. Minister of Finance. The cause of BM Bruil's retirement is not stateda, but very probably it ia connected with a project for the re-est3blishment of some suppressed taxes. If the French Senate has winced under the corretion- administered to it in the Moniteur a week or ti- ' ago, tlat ihstrious and useful body is now determined to tbke its stand on a really high pos-, tion, and to prove to the world that it is not the passive thing it is deemed. It has been taunted with a.want of initiative in the public business of the country; and this cruel reproach it i3 resolved, not precisely to fling back in the face of those who made it, but to free itself from by an act of extraordinary vigour. I dare notguarantee the authenticity of the rumour-but it is -whispered in quarters which are, of course, well informed, that -the Senate vill prove its power of initiative by drawing up, anid perhaps even presenting, an address to the Emperor on .the birth of an Imperial Prince, or Princess-as the case may be ! If this be not "initiative," I Inow not what is. Apropos of the 'lecture in the AMoniteur, it is certain that several of the Conscript Fathers had thought of imitating M. Drouyn de Lhuys, and, as they paced angrily the halls of the luxembourg Palace, they worked themselves up to the proper pitch of excitement necessary for the painful operation of resigning; but alas! the fierce resolve evaporated much as Bob Acres' manhood oozed through the palms of his hands, and the threat was not executed. "I shall resign, I will resign, I must resign," said a foaming and embroidered. Senator to a well-known witty personage, of whom, patriotism has also been a vocation of great pro-asperity. " You will not." "Pourquoi pas ?" " Pour trente-cinq bonnes raisons, a 1,000f. piece," was the reply. It was conclusive. The address in which the Senators are to exercise their new-born "initiative" will be a ctuiosity. AL Desprez has been appointed sub-director in the department of Foreign Aflirs in the room of AL Lefebvre de Beconr, who is going out to La Plata as Minister Plenipotentiary. Count Aloys de Rayneval, Secretary of Legation at Hanover, is named to the same post at Florence; and IVI. de Bonnieres, Second Secretary at Berne, is named Secretary of Legation at Hanover. 'I'he Monsitmur contains decrees making various appointments and changes of residence among the magistracy. At a general meeting of the shareholders of the Tarragona to Reus Railway Company, held lately in Paris, the account of construction was stated to be 1,815,584f. The Directors had renounced aU payment for their services until such time as the line should be opened to the public, which event was stated to be about to tak;e place in a few months. The works had been urged on with such activity that the line might be opened about the present timiie, had not the firm of Sharp and Stewart, of Manchester, found themselves unable to deliver, until the month of May, the locomotives wvith which they were charged. Each locomotive will cost 59,000f. The report states that the shares will probably be before long quoted at the Bourse of Paris. The receipts of the Orleans railway during the week ending on the 28th ult. were 861,520f. or 151,774f. more than during the corresponding weelk of 1S55. The grosareceipts sineethe lstof January amounted to 3,318,049f., being a difference in favour of 1850 of 401,736f.

We read in the Opinione, of Turin, of the 6th inst. - " To-morrow, or after to-morrow, Baron Tecco, the Sardinian Minister-Plenipotentiary at Constantinople, is expected at Turin. We already stated that the correspondent of the Indipendance Beige was misinformed when he announced that the Piedmontese Cabinet recalled Baron Tecco because he had protested against his exclusion from the conferences on the future administration of the Danubian provinces. Baron Tecco had been invited to return to Turin on important business, long before that question was brought forward, and on no occasion was the conduct of the Sardinian Envoy disapproved of by his Government." According to the Genoa. Cor-iereMlercantilf of the 5th, M. Massimo d'Azeglio had declined the honour of representing Piedmont at the Peace Conferences. The Chamber of Deputies was to resume, on the 6th, the discussion on the estimates of the fnance department for 1856. The Opinione says:- " 14t a moment when peace negotiations are about to open it is impossible to overlook the Italian question. Should that question not be solved agreeably to the enlightened ideas of the age and the rights of nations, it will prove a permanent source of apprehension and perturbation, and Piedmont cannot view -with indifference the revolutions -which may hereafter occur in the peninsula, nor tell what part she may think proper to act in future events. It has been observed that in Italy parties seldom desert their principles. If weexceptthepartisans of constitutionalmonarchy, the remainder are mere sectarianq, pursuing a sterile policy, which divides men, instead of uniting them, and is a constant source of disagreement. If the latter could bebrought to understand that the salvation of Italy depends on the union of her sons, it would be a very important preliminary step towards the achievement of that object." The Genoa Corriere Mercantile, of the 5th inst., has the following - " The Mediterranean Electric Telegraph Company, which is at this moment occupied in laying down the necessary wires to unite the island of Sardinia with La Calle, on the coast of Africa, intends to establish a complete telegraphic communication between Europe and Melbourne, inSouthern Australia. After opening secondary lines between La CaMe, Bona, Bugia, Algiers, and Oran, the Company proposes to run the principal line by Tunis, Tripoli, Alexandria, Cairo, Suez, Jerusalem, Damascus, Bagdad, Bussorah, along the northern coast of the Sea of Oman, Hyderabad, and Bombay, wvhere the line is to separate into two branches. The northern branch will proceed directly to Agra, whence a wire will be directed towards Iahore and Peshawur, and thus reach -within a short distance of Cabul and Cashmere. From Agra the telegraphic line will pass through Benares and unite at Calcutta with the southern branch, which, startingfrom Bombay, will pass through Bangalore and Madras. From Calcutta the line will follow the north-east coast of the Gulf of Bengal, the peninsula of Malacca, the Sunda islands, and thence cross Over' to the north of Australia, and, extending along the eastern coast of that continent, communicate with its numerous settlements, until it ultimately reaches Port Adelaide. The entire length of the line is estimated at 20,000 kdlo. m6tres." Genoa will soon communicate by railway with Nice, and, subsequently, with Toulon and Marseilles. A number of engineers are at this moment assembled at Savona, to decide on the expediency of running the line either along the Ligurian coast or through the valleys of the interior. The port of Genoa received in 1855 5,843 vessels, and was visited by 31,574 travellers; 800 of those -essels belonged to Marseilles, 476 were Eng,lisL, 037 Spanish, 476 Neapolitan, &c. A letter from Florence says- . A Ministerial modification is about to take place in Tuscas.y. The Duke of Casigiano, Minister f Foreign Affairs, Ilts by the death of his father become Prinoe Corsini, and intends to reside at Rome. His sCcessor wil prob3bly be Chevalier J. Martini, who -As WAnister of Tuscany at Turin from 1848 to 1850." SPAIN.S. (mROX OF¢ O'WX CORPE85PG!;El.) MARID, FEE. 4. I understand that Lord Howden is about sending home a postal convention, in a shape ia which it is thought it may be accepted by our Government. In considering this question, we must remember that the Spanish Go.ernment has largely reduced the amount of postage charged till recently on letters from England, the letters formerly paying 10 reals being now charged only 4 reals (10d.), and that without any reciprocal reduction on Spanish letters on our part. It m:ay be said on the other side, that all the expense of carrying letters from Spain to the Philipine Islands, &c., falls on Our Government, which is true, but even then a large reduction on the present charges would probably yield more than the maintenance of the present state of things, experience having shown as theory predicted that the number of letters sent is greatly increased in proportion as the charge on them is diminished. We are now in the midst of the Carnival, and nothing but fun and folly seems thought of. Yesterday as the worthy representative of the United States, Mr. Dodge, was riding towards the Prado, a masque sprung on the horse behind him with a clever jump, and pronouncing his name insisted on accompanying him on his ride in that position. 3Ir. Dodge not exactly relishing making so p4lic a display, and coneiving that the voice of his would-be companion was not wholly unknown to him, got down and consigned his horse to the discretion of the masque, who in due course of time returned it by a messenger to the owner, giving a fictitious name. The little Princess is taken out daily in an open] carriage to the Prado with different dresses-one day as a Manola, another as a Maja, &c. It must not be supposed, however, that politics are altogether dormant. On the contraxy, we are probably on the eve of furtler Ministerial changes. The Minister of MIarine (Don7Antonio Santa Cruz), having quarellecd with the Spanish Board of Admiralty, lately nominated as a consulting Junta,when he required their assistance, has dismissed them all in a decree published to-day, and appointed other naval men in their place. The changes that seem to be expected are not likely to interfere materially at present with the system of dualism which makes Generals Espartero and O'Donnell the pillars of the Government, but circumstances appear taking a direction which may bring the " situacion," as it is termed. to become either a more exclusively Progresista one, or lead to a reaction in a Moderado sense. The debates on the Electoral Law may precipitate such a crisis. The present Constituent Cortes were elected under a decree which fixed the payment of 100 reals in direct taxes as the qualification for electors, and many contend that they cannot consistently restrict it beyond that sum, while the disposition of the Mloderado elements in the Government and a large portion (though not apparently a majority) of the Deputies is to raise the qualification considerably beyond that amount. Another idea which the same parties have adopted is to exclude military men under the rank of Brigadier from' being eligible for election, which is also opposed by the Progressistas generally, as an undue interference with the rights of the electors. Carlist designs are again talked of as likely to be attempted in the Spring in Gatalonia and Arragon, Gabrera being spoken of as the chief, and his plans aLs being in opposition to the counsels of -Elio, Arevalo, &c., and even to the present views of the Count of Montemolin. Lord Howden had a dinner party of 34 guests last evening, composed of ministers and ex-ministers, diplomatists, capitalists, literary men, and artists of aU kinds. His lordship had also a large evening party afterwards. The Credit Mobilier Company here is expected to commence operations by the 15th or 20th of this month. The Three per Cents. were done at the Bolsa today at 38.75 cash, and the Deferred ditto at 24.40. ELECTRIC TELEGRAPHIC DESPATCHES. (FRO o0n OWT CORRErsOrecDcNr.) SOUTEAMPTO1T, S&TURDAY MOLN-oG.

THE STEMER BELGIQUE. We are requested by the agents for the BelgianTrans. Atlantic Company to fpnbllsh the following docmuents respecting their steamer Belgique, whose unfortunate essay in her first voyage has been described by our Southampton corzespondent: -rendent- " Southampton, Feb. 4. "1 Gentlemen,-In compliance with your request, we this day surveyed the Belgique steamship in the dry dock at this port and have to report as follows - " We0 thoroughly examined the hull of the ship, and the only leak of -prtance we could discover was before the main sternpost betweenthe garboard strakes and the keeL in the wake of the angle-iron placed there to increase the stiffness of that part of the keeL We also found several of the butts and rivets, more partioularly in midships, slightly disturbed, and the top sides of the ship near the large ports exhibited symptoms of working. "The mainmast has settled down in consequence of a want of strength in that part which supports the step. " The port boiler has received damage in the furnaces,> caused by the plate having been overheated. "O,n,, f-t1 b5bd v ti,u scun propenler is czacRoe4 and some of the nuts and screws at the end of the stern pipe are torn off or damaged; this may have been caused by the screw having caught a hawser while it was in motion " In consequence of the symptoms working beforemen. tioned we beg to recommend that the cargo ports should be entirely closed and plated up to correspond with the rest of the ship's sides, and that all loose rivets should be cut out and replaced, and butts of plates examined and calked where found necessary. " We also recommend, in order to remove all doubt as to the strength of the vessel, that she should be fitted with an iron striger, wrought on each side between the main and spar decks, extending at least three-fourths of the ship's length ;-this stringer to be 2ft. 6in,. deep, and 5ft. 8in. thick, with an angle-iron 3 by 2', rivetted to the upper andI lowver edges, and fastenedto a reverse angle-iron on eachaide of the frames. | "'Werecommead] that all the pumps should be overhauled and put in good order, andwash-plates fitted on each side under the floor plates of engme-room, to prevent them being washed up; also, that the hold and 'twixt' declk illars be properly secured at top and bottom to the beams. The step of mainmast should also be more securely fastened and supported on the-top of the tunneL "The furnaces of the defective boiler must be zepaired and made good, and the cracked blade of the propeller efficiently repaired.

PRUSSIA. (FMOZk ouIn OwN coMMWONDw-i,.) BERLiN, FEB. 5. The PrussianChambers, or, as it is now more correct to call them, the two Houses of the Diet, seldom form the sbject matter of ary of my letters. I trust that there are none of your many readers who, misled by any fancied analogy between these two Legislative bodies and our own Houses of Parliament, take this omission of mine ill. From the indications I gave at the beginling of the session as to the constituent elements of the two Houses and of the overwhelming majority on the Right Side, the upholders of a reactionary ultra-Tory course, it will have been seen how little was to be expected from them either beneficial to the land itself or interesting to those abroad. No subject of foreign policy is ever introduced there; the Houses contain no European celebrities; and in the recent elections those leaders of parties from whom regene- ration or reform, or at least some little change for 1 the better, was hoped have been excluded. To trace up to its causes this retrograde progress in public opinion, which has thus found its reflex in the constitution of the House of Deputies, is beside my present object, which is simply to report a few particulars of the business of the session, as far as it has gone, together wlith a alight indication that the very magnitude of the evil consisting in this overwrhelming numerical superiority of the Right Side is probably about to w ork out its owvn cure. The " Programme of the Right Side," which I have mentioned on a former occasion as having been printed and circulated among the members of that party at the commencement of the session, excited so much dissatisfaction among those whose co-operation it pre-supposed that it was subsequently disavowed and withdrawn, and at a somewhat later period it was superseded by a plan of the ensuing legislatorial campaign drawn up in a much milder form. Nevertheless, only yesterday, the view was expressed in the House of Deputies that the best way to save time to the Legislature would be to strike out at once an1 the paragraphs of the Charter that still savour of the period and eircumstan¢cs (revolutionary) under which it received its birth. In conformity with this feeling, which prevails on the Right Side of the House, the Ministry has already procured the repeal of the 42d article of the Charter, which had liberated real property from the various feudal fetters it was hitherto subject to, and deprived it at the sanme time of various rights of special jurisdiction, &c.; and in connexion with this subject the 114th article has been also erased from the Charter. On the motion of the Government also article 88, which, according to our notions, very properly forbids al judges to hold any other office. or to follow. any other avocation simultaneously with their judicini functions, has been also repealed, as far as the resolution of the House of Notables is concerned. In addition to the above, the repeal of the following articles has been moved for bymembers of the Right Side :-Article 4, guaranteeig the equality of all in the eye Of the law, and nbolishin privileges of rank in this respect; article 1k throwing open aU offices of State to al subjects without distinction of religion; article 76, fixing the month of November in every year as the period when the Kin isto sumon the Chambers to meet reg,ularly; and article 107, which lays down certain regulations tendmgv' to render changes in the constitution more difflcult,by interposing a period of three weeks between the two divisions necessary to make any such resolution on a paragraph of the constitution valid. Thislist, however, does not by any means exhaustthenumberof those clauses whichthe present Tory Reformers propose to themselves to eliminate. In the debate, however, on the two last mentioned articles, which took place yesterday, the symptoms of reaction against the reactionary party to which I alluded above showed themselves. Although the motion for the repeal' of article 76 had in some degree the advantage of Ministerial support, it was thrown out by 217 votes against 76; and as regards article 107, although its alteration had been resolved on by the House of Notables, and Ministers approved and backedl the change, the motion for facilitating alterations of the constitution was lost by a majority of 199 against 93. While I am on the subject of Prussia's Parliamentary exhibition of the present spirit of the nation I will add the following, illustrations. In opposing the motion for therepeal of article 42, the result of which would be to restore to the proplietors of landed estates all those meedieval rights that make the tenant actually a vassal and almost a serf, Count Schwerin said, addresing the Right Side:- " You affirm that attacks are made by the Left Side upon the nobility. Gentlemen, 1, for one, am in the possession of estates that my ancestors possessed hundreds of years back-, and kept them, because they knew how to undeistand the signs of the times. It is my endeavour also to interpret the signs of the times, and to act in accordance with them, and for that reason what Ifirst and foremost of all must struggle against isjunskndiuss (squireocracy, and Ithe petty, narrow. minded, self-seel-ng spirit that pervades it). The two brothers Von Humboldt belong also to the nobility just as much as the two brothers Von Gerlacli do. I recommend you to follow the example of the former rather thanthat of the latter." What the spirit of the Prussian squireocraey is towards their vassals may be seen from a petition presented to the Legislature by a Pomeranian landowner, praying for relief under the following aggravating circumstances .-He had issued his commands on his estates that when any of his people spoke to im they should do so bareheaded ; on such and such a day, while inspecting his field labourers, one to v,hom he spoke had answered without taking, off his cap. On being admnonishled he had replied he wvas accustomed to take off his cap in rooms, butnot in thefields. The obstinate fellow was not to be moved by threats of any sort, although there isa paragraph of a law which ordains that servants who remain wilfully obstinate and disobedient to their masters commands are liable to a fine of 5 thalers or three days' imprisonment. The Pomeranian landowner had in vain applied to the Landrath, the Procureur du Roi, and the Minister of Justice to get this law strained and put into force against his vassal, and, failing in gaining them over tD his views, he ap pesnow to the Legislature to help him to his right of puniishing the refractory vassal who thus offendshis patrimonial dignity. The following will also show how men inthe upper circles here comprehend constitutionalism and the standingof the ouses of Legislature, which the Kifig himself has instituted and sworn to maintain in harmony with the constitultion :-On taldne the oaths to the constitution preparatory to taking his seat inthe House of Nobles, a brilliant specimen of noblo intelligence makes an express reservation of the oath of allegiance that he'has already sworn to the King as his subject, and of the oath of fidolity and obedience that he had swom on enterLug the army I A Russian 'eldjitgor, who passed through here last Week, has brought to Baron Brunow in Franldrt his redentials and full powers to reproeb Rtussia at the approaching Peace Conferences in Paris.

BERLIN, Fm 6. The Russian press has lecome suaddenly so pacific that the reader might- almost fancy 3ussia -was the lamb that the wolf Europe was constantly terrifying and frightening -out. of its propriety and peacefulness. You have doubtless seen and noticed a St. Petersburg article in Lae Nord describing the impression producecd in that capital by the new mise cn sc2Ne - of the Oriental question. - I will endeavour to cuU for you a few flowers more from the saume journaistic soil,whiqh se'e,ms to produce plants of every kind and fruits of every taste at the command of the Government; If it depends apon the Russian Cabinet al6ne, we are informed, peace is certain; the points contained in the draughts of preliminaries are by no means so unacceptable as they might seem at first' sight, and, Russian diplomacy will know how to develope the honey from them -while it deprives them of their sting. All the drearar about the Agia Sophia, that were so rife three years back, are being discountenanced and colmitted to oblivion; the object that Russia had all along in view-the protection of the Greek Christians-will now be most satisfactorily attained by their being put under the joint protectorate of all the great Powers; and to holy orthodox Russia belongs the imperishable honour of having taken the initiative in the attainment of this desirable end ! The idea that has frequently been broached before, that the. "sick man" is likely to be brought much quicker to the grave bya permainent consultation of many doctors thanby the good offices of one, is not forgotten, though it is no longer printed; it is, "though lost to sight, to memory dear." Among the private consolations addres,sed to the Russian people for home consumption is the as,surance that this arrangaement with the rest of Europe 'will not in the slightest degree interfere with the verification of the Emperor's announcement on the occasion of his maounting the throne, that his " reign should be a continuation of the reignof Peter I. and Catherine," d&c. It is considered that the progress of the late negotiations has already produced two results: the Russ,ian concessions have-llrstly, stoppedj Austria's mouth, and secondly, turned the heart of FrYance towards the path of peace. Eng,land, left to herself, has neither the wrill nor the power to continue the war. This will give Russia time to work out the plan of the Grand Duike Constantine for the attainment of a respectable marine force, the two main features of which are the sutbstitution of steamers for sailing, vessels, and the substitution of Russians and Greeks for the English in the naval service, for which purpose the new corps of operative engineers has been formed. The crews-for the future fleet are already formed to hand, inured to hardship, and to the rough service of the Black Sea; having scuttled their -vesse]s in Sebastopol harbour and otherwise done the State good service, they are now every day enrolling themselves, at Cronstadt and Sweaborg.- The G;rand Duke Constantine informs the navy in g¢eneral orders thatthe Emperor, in spite of the very considerable burdens pressin;g on the revenues of the State just now, has been graciously pleased to improve the position of the officers of the navy by raising their pay to an equality with that of the offlcers of the armny. The table, or tarif of the future pay, as, soon as it has met with the approval of the Admnalty, is to be published and acted on this year. "It is with most heartfelt satisfaction" that the Grand Duke makes the above announcement. In consideration of the great loss lately experienced in naval officers killed or wounded in the present war, and in consideration that the brave warriors of the fleet have shown themselves also worthy defenders of their country on the continent, and in actions of artillery in the Crimea and in KRamtschr.tka, the Emperor has been graciously pleased to order that the present number of pupils of the Naval Cadet Corps shall be increased by 00, and the additional expenses accruing therefrom be provided for in this year's budget. Furthermore, all naval officers who took part in the defence of Sebastopol have had one year's pay additional handed to them as a dotuceur; and, finally, an Imperial ukase holds out to naval offlcers wFhose duty may call them away from home for several years at a time on distant expeditions the considerate arrangemnent, that during their absence their families may draw from the Government Eon account of their pay the money necessary for their subsistence and the education of their chlildren. The six screw gunboats now building at Archangel have been christened Rasboinik, Opritschnik, Strielok Plastun, Naiesdnik, and Dschigit. From the above enumeration of various small matters connected -with the fleet, it will be evident that R-ussia does not by any means look upon the loss of the Black Sea fleet as a fatal wound inflcted on her naval power. Generals Wassiltachikoff anid Todtleben have each of them received the Order of St. George, the Grand artyr and Bringer of Victory, 3d Class. The Sebastopol medal is to be conferred on all persons, from the general down to the private, who took part in the defence of Sebastopol, and even all who were in the town on duty during the defence, this last regulation includes all the women, of various ranks, who evinced their courage by bestowving their kind offices and solicitude on the sick and thc wounded during the siege. It is also expected that a medal will be struck for the Transcaucasian army, in commemoration of the late campaign in Asia. According to the I1u1alide, the troops in and about St. Petersburg amount nowf to 33 battalions of infantry, 28W squadrons of cavalry, with 14A batteries of field artsillery, not including the Keva batteries and the armament of the Peter and Paul fortress. IJp te the endiof January no measure of the Government had come to the knowledge of the public implying any relaxation in the preparations for war: whenever this is commenced the first step will be to dissand tho two levies of tho Militia, and to stop the organization of the army of reserve at Mloscow, under Tscheodaie£f The next step will be to send home to their families all those who have been summoned to their regiments while ab)sent on leave, or after having even retired from - nilitary service. En no country will the return to a state of peace he so rapidly made sensible to the population as in Russia. The following narrative is about to go the rounds of the press, showing how the Emperor Alexander tried 'bard to lure away the Emperor Louis Napoleon .from the Eng,lish alliance, and howv the Emper6r Louis NEapoleon remaained true and firm to his engagements. - Friendly courtesies, 'but of a strictly private nature, had been kept up since the commencement of the war between members of the Imperial familyof Russia and the Princss Mathilde, the cousin of the Emperor of the French, a natural result of her union with Prince Demidoff; in September last a political turn was given to this channel, and one of the smaller Gorman States undertook to bring about a separate peace between France and Russia. Russia communicated to France the concessions she was willing to malke (and which subsequently were published in the circular despatch of the 22d of December), and in addition offered to Frnce special advantages for herself. These temp- tations, however, the Emperor resisted, although thealliance offered by Russia openedthe widest field to' French ambitionand love of conuest; considerable territorial acquisition ers'to petheprice and 'the result of this nnion of the two greatest and most aggressive military Powers; but it involved a breach of the Emperors engagement with Engla2nd, whichl would have throwin inn into the same .-tfi and career as his uncle had unfortunatey todaen. The Emperor, on refusing these overtures, commnunicated them to London and Vienna. The result in this latter capital was, 'that AuJstria became suddenly alive to the danger to which she had been exposed, an quickly rrsolvedupon putting herself on anunequirocalfoot& Etowards aU partiee. the proposals she drew up -for the conclusion of A peace, after being revisdand somewhat nhaB*eneq3 mLondon and Paris were forwarded to St. Peters. burg, and accepted there. lhilethee negotiitions were going on Russia- got windof them, and en.- deavoured to anticipate them by authorizing Prince Gortschalkoffto communicate in Vienna the conce%sion that had been already mentioned to France, and which forned the contents' of the despatch.o0 the !22d of December. The Prince accordingly caUled upon Count Buol, and addressing him with, ";Well, msy dear count, I bring you peace," opened his budget of commnunications, but met with the; objection that Iossia's offier cametoo late; Austra had already drawn up her own propositions, and -v'uiitted them to France and in o ls ffi Advices from WaZ.. ' hti oheunc of the decease of Prince. t ne days' mourning has been oraered foe- , whole country by the Emperor; all places of -amnusement will remain closed, and the Guard and v i Y p*'iut oncrape; the regiments that bear theMarsh2i S e will, however, keep on their mourning f'2 A weeks. The Paris Presse publishes the following letter, dated " St. Petersburg, Jan. 29"- " Prince Gortschalcoft who handed over at Odessa the command of the Army of- the South to his successor, Gene. ril LUders, arrived here on the 24th of January vith three of his aides-de-camp. The same day the Prince was adnitted to a private audience at the ,Winter Palace. The Emperor expressed tobhim his thanks for the services he had rendered duringthe operations in the Crimea, and fonnly promised bim the command of the army in Poland. " The P.rince aLRo paid visits to the Grand Dukes, to the Ministcr of War, and to some of thel3igh dignitaries, and his reception -was everywhere most cordial; that by the population of St. Petersburg was not the less so, and a fete has been given in his bonour by the inhibitaits. " Great preparations for war are being made, despite the prospect of aece. It seems as if the arsenals were working twvice as hard since the decision of the Czar. The Grand Dulte Constantine, Prince lecnschikodff, and some of the superior officers of the navy are continuily inspecting the doelcyards. "On the other haiud, two or three successive reviems have been held of the garrison of the capital, and every morning the Invalide ltasc publishes the names of the officers ap. pointed to i-acancies. The divisions in Tauris and in Asia under General M ourveff appear to have lost a great many men, as reinforcements are sent to them from all 'he divi. sions in the Caucasus and in Southern Russa . "The Emperor Alexander IL appeas nevertheless, resolved to abide by his pacific intentions, but the news from the interior causes him some annoyance. MIoscow and the Boyards groumble at his decision. If the hopes of peace are realized, it may be said that that the towns situated or. the sea-coast, especially the manufacduring towns, vill evince real satisfaction, whereas the cities that have no commerce, and the country places-the dweDlings of the priesthood and nobles-will show dissatisfaction. "Count Valentine Esterhazy, whom every man seemed rather inclined to avoid before the 16th of January, is now the honoured guest everywhere; he has become the lion of the capital since the acceptance of the Austrian propositions. " It is said that as soon as peace is signed the Emperor and Empress of Ruassia will proceed to 3loscow for their coronation. On this occsion an amnesty will he granted to the Polish political offenders." SARDIRA. (RoMf Otis oWN CORRESPONDIENT.) - - ~~~~TURINr, Fmn. 3. An article which appeared in VTe Times of the 26th ult., on the prospects of Piedmont in the event of an immediate peace, has produced an impression here that the state of public feeling in Piedmont is not understood in England, nor its objects in entering into the Western alliance duly appreciated. Coming, as it did, at the same time as reports frona the Consd.itx'tion,iel anidI IRide ,dance Belge that Sardinia was iotto obtain an equalshare with the other belligerent Powers in the peace conferences, the article has been made a stallring-horse by the opponents of Government to sow dissension and disgust among the supporters of the alliance. It may be well, therefore, to state in a few vords what seem to have been the real motives which actnated the rulers of this country when they decided, rather more than a twelvemonth sincem to unite its destinies with those of France and Emgland in the great struggle which at that moment was cerainly not very favourable to the cause they joined. Like the allies of the 10th of April, 1854, Sardinia, as a mnaritime and commercial nation, felt a direct interest in the imminent danger threatened to the freedom of trade in the Black Sea, as well as an indirect interest in the peace of Europe generally; for both of vhich reasons she judged it most prudent to assist what she considered the side of justice, instead of leaving the champions of civilization to fight her cause for her, or merely giving them empty tokens of sympathy. On the first invitation, then, fromn the Western Powers the Government of Sardinia willingly and heartily agreed to put on foot sulch a force as her limited territory and crippled finance would permit; but, as she, more than any other Power in the alliance, had an immediate interest in the ameiorationof the state of the people of Italy (for which she had recently made so many unsuccessful sacrifices), it was not unnatuar3 that both Government and the country should hope that their promptitude in aiding in this distant warwould insure them friends in the settlement of disputes nearer home. Those who followed the course of the debates on the treaty will recollect that this was the spirit of the arguments of the majority, and even those who opposed that policy did so on the g,round that the only army which Italy possessed ought not to be sent out of the country in a war which threatened to become European. It was, indeed, most honourable to the Sardiuian Parliament that on that occasion it discussed the proposed treaty and disposed of it more as a question of Italian than of Piedmontese policy; for, had the old leaven of municipalism been allowed to pre^ dominate, a small kingdom of 5,000,000 inha-bitants with a heavy debt rnight have been well content to enjoy her own free institutions uriobtrusively, and left the great Powers to undertaLe distant contests on the confines of Europe, content to fisk their commercial interests to the general settlement at the ternmnation of the war. It was undoubtedly, therefore, with a hope-a hope openly expressed and recognized-of gaining friends to the emancipation of Italy that Sardinia agreed to send a force to the Crimea, and it is because the course of events hitherto, so far from giving promise of such a conssummation, should peace be made at present, has tended rather to confrm foreign rule and despotism inthe Peninsula, that the termination of hostilities is not looked forward to with pleasure at thlis moment. A pacific solution of Italian affiirs would suit Sardinia infinitely bettor than a warlike one ; but all hopes of such have vanished before the extending, moral influence of Austria-the very incarnation of despotism and foreign domination-so much so, that while te city of the Pope is guarded by a French garison, Austrian policy reigns paramount in the Sacred Council, and the Courts of Naples, Florence, DBi adena, and Parma are as entirely sAubservient to the same influences; and, as the principles of this coalition are in direct antagonism to the wishes of the people, the moderate party fears, with much reason, the resuscitation of those wild enthusiasts who have latterly been almost devoidcof followers, and a repetition, perhaps, of the insurections aud persecutions of the last six or seven years. infactatheSardiniansfind themselvesmuchin the positionl of a gentlomanweho has made greati exertions to b3il sfrienld, and,-after havigpaid half the sum,i isi told the rest Will not be required, as his frend mulst remana in limbo; and they are not quite satisfied with the proceedings.- _

AICULITECTURAL PHENOMfENOY. TO THE EDITOB OF TEIE TIMES. Sir,-It is credibly reported that the Clock Tower of the new Houses of Parliament has got itself into a sad scrape. Of course, no one isto blame; no one everis to blame when Government affairs get into a scrape. But it seems that, by reason (it may be supposed) of its adherence to departmnental routine and its extreme aversion to any hints frm unofficial quarters, this systematic clock tower has buit itself up, lie George IML's dumpling, so that there is no knowing how the apple is to get in. It has long slits of windows, each m3asuring (by my eyes about 37feet 9 inches high by about 44 inches wide; and these, to all external observation, axe the only orifice) through -which the clock, to measure about 45 feet or so eubic, and its bob major bells, to weigh from 30 tons or so downwards, are to be insinuated into the interior of the tower. But, happily, architectural genius is neverat a loss, and it is said that an estimate of the expense of the requisite scaffolding, pulling down, and rebuilding, including 10 per cent. for contingencies, has been made, and that clock and bells tan be got into the tower for the most insignificant sum of only 3,oOO. ! When Mr. Disraeli hears of this he will, for very shame, ,ive up all notion of hanging an architect for the good of the public; and when my respected old friend, Mr. John 3ull, baa to pay the 3,000., he most assuredly wir insist on paying 5. instead of 2C. IOs. per cent. commision on the estimate, even if the 10 percent. for contingencies aliould, contrary to all recent experience in my immediate neighbourhood, be swelled to more than cent. per cent. Another of my old friends, Westminster Abbey, whispers - tome that in his youth the freemasons managed to get bells into cathedral towers without pulling them to pieces; but he is a doting lauMdator temporis acdi. What I most love to .-e is geeius strugrling with difficulties, and what I love next is to see genius get itself into a difficulty by --ldng such a mistake as a common builder would lie ashamed of, so as to have the glory of struggling with it. It did my old rafters good to see the gradua rising of the clock tower, with nothing but its slits to let in the cloc'k and bells, and if it had not been for fear of rattling out all the 'glass in the leaky casement windows of the new houses E should have shaken my stiff old sides with a hearty chuckle when I saw the clock dial holes securey walled up, so that the straggle Jecame inevitable. 3My semi-medical reighbour, the General 'Board of Health, talks of cdflatir the constricted passages of the tower; k't he is one of the very new lights, and I am sure that you Will agree with me that nothing could be so good for it, or * o consonant with all reasonable architectural practice, as a little wholesome pulling down and rebuilding.

Ikhe proceedings took place in the Town-hall, a smnall apartment, wich, notwithstanding its linited accommodation, On not incontveniently filled. In the town there was not the slightest manifestation of public excitement, and a stranger would have observed nothing in the slighest degree indicative of so imnportant a local event as the choice of a representative to serve the borough in Parliament. It is only necssry urhertopremise that Midhurst has a population of about 1,Wo inhabitants, is distant 2ndiles from the nearest rawa and that Lord Egimont has the poweuof returninr a th yhe chooses to select for the p -ace.

Wxnscsu rose and thanked the electors for their generous kindness, which had placed him in a very proud position. He trusted that his conduct woald be such as to enable him, if events rendered it necessary, to return again to Mdhust without causing a blush on the face of any of his constituents. He could say on his honourtliat ho believed no mran had ever entered the House of Comnrois, since the country had a House of Comnuonsi more utterly free and independent then himself. (Cheers.) Through their kindness hoe wenst thither as free as air-as free as the breeozs which blew about Midhurst at that moment, though not aso fickle and inconstant. No man in Enigland could have beeu bore astonihed than himsglf, whenlie received au invitatoe iu London to cone down and stand for the boraigh. Mr. Spencer Walpole was his oldes friend, both in prabli and private life. He (Mr. Warren) ws with hisu some aew weeks before, but not a brth had he uttered about Mid hurst. Mr. Goulburn was still alve ; but, from the death of that gentleman up tovthe a ent when he was invited to come forward, hme ha never heardl a syable frony fr. Wal. poleorany human beingaetot heeborough (Cheers.) He shoun Lgo into Parliament unfettered. bv anv uncer. ,saULg, secrer or open, vxpress or implied; and this was because those wIse brought him before the electors had some confidence in his public character. He would not per'it himself to be disturbed by anyhard things that hadbeen said of him ; and, had ther been a contest, he would have endeavoured to conduct itin the spirit o?f a Chrisin gentlemana. (Cheers.) Whereveuhe had gone in his canvass he had heard the praises of Mr. Walpole, whose memory lived in the hearts of the electors, and who he (Mr. Warren) knew would always tenderly cherish the recollection of his 10 years' representation of Mdhurst. The ]resent was the first time (and they did not see a young maan m him) that he had ever presented himsalf to a constituency, and a very proud position it was to oecupy. When he determined to accept the honour which they had conferred on him, his first resolution was to de the duty of an honest candidate. Being unfettered himself, he resolved to see whether or not he bad the unfettered sapport of every elector. (Cheers.) A placard had been extensively circe.- lated, stating that the whole thing vas a juzle between Mr. Walpole and himself. Both their addresses were issued on the Lath of January, and on the 21st he came among them. Why did not the gallant and literary gentleman from whom that placard had proceeded a1so come among them at the same time ? Why did he not meet him (Mr. Warren) face to face in this battle 2 iHe was there as an Englishman, and would have met the hon. and gallant and lterary gentleman as an Englishman should. (Cheers.) ince, hovever, his opponent had not come forward, lie would dismiss him from~s their ffuther notice, after observig thathe ought not to havelibelled the constituency. what had been his (Mr. Warren's) conduct? He had come down to blidhursl, and had spent 11 consecutive days in canvassing that same pocket borough He had done so at no little sacrifice of time and of health also, for he was no' accustomed to the keen and cuttmg winds of these hills. The local journalsihad said, and it had received the tremendous echo of The Times, that he bad been so brief in the terms of his address, and had exhibited such reticence (that was the new and ugly word for it), that he had disdained to explain himself to ihe electors. He did not complain of these remarks. He admitted that the address 'was brief-possibly too brief. He came among them not graced by any pretensions to rank or wealth: as on,e of the middle classes, with no aristocratic connexions; one of themselves, in Lord Holt's words, "chosen by the people from among the people." (Cheers.) He was the nominee of no man, nor would he stoop to beso. (Cheers.) On the other hand, he would not be the delegate of any body of electors, but woald fill to the best of his abilities the position of a representative of the people. Every measure having in view the good of the people would receive his honest and unbiassed support; for-his eyes would look only to the substantial merits of each measure, from whatever side of the house it might come. He was aware that, as the successor of Mr. WValpole, he appeared before them under disadvantages ; but he quoted a pamphlet written by him at the timne of the Papal aigression, and addressed to hisright hon. friend, with theviewof showing that their poliical sentiments were identcaL He declared that he would go into the House of Commnons, not asthe creature of expediency, but as a man of fied and sound principles. (Cheers.) From these principles lhe had never wavered, and to them hewvould be ashiueas steel to the7last. Hehad no secrets, and he did not care for promises, whatever quarter they came from. What he thought r,ght, that he would do. (Cheers.) Be would not repudiate party, interpreting that word in a strictly guarded sense. People naturally aggregated into classes representing leading principles, and so far be was a party man. But he woul not fowow any man whitliersoever he might lead, for it woula ill become the representative of the borough of, lidhurst to do so. (Cheers.) As far, however, as it became a man to follow; he would fo]1lrw the Earl of Derby. (Hear, hear.) He beievedthatnoble earl to be a man of transcendent ability and the highest character; in the language Of the Ezsaminer, "having the honour of the country at heart, and no one knowing better in what that honour consisted." Mr. Warren then proceeded to state his views on questions of general polities afbeting the welfare of the State. In doig so, he said that the first object which caught his eyes was the crnuson cloud of war. If the Earof Derby had not been so suddenly and rnthlesily displaced, it was his conviction that not a soldier of liussia wrould haeve crossed the Pruth, and the war would have been avoided. (Hear, hear.) He held that opinion in common with many most distinzruished persons, one of whom had told him that he had never regretted any act of his life so much as that of assisting to drive the Earl of Derby from power. When that event took place the nation "drifted"into war, and every one now was startled at the retrospect. But he could not shut his eyes to the disclosures at that fortressSebstopeL It was imposnble to believe that such accumnulation of warlike naterial could have been got together if there were not a profound scheme for long-cherished purpoees of aggression; and who vwould venture to say that sooner or later something of the kind was not inevitable? Since the storm had burst, we must deal with it as best we could, and therefore in entering the House he would av, " let bygones be bygones." Ifaving praised the womanly tenderness and ympathy for the sufferings of thearmy evinced by Her Majesty and thedevoted.berommn of Florence Nightingale, 3fr. Warren proceeded to explain the course he intended topursue in Parliament. He said that hewould be moderate but watchfuldand determined - that he was neither for peace at any price nor for war at ah hazards. The question vas passing from the hands of soldiers to those of statesmnen, and no one could reard it in its present phase without profound solicitude and without breathing a prayer that God might direct their coursels,-that e would put it into the heart of the Powers on-the one side to exact nothing -Obut what was just, and on the other to concede as much. (Cheers.) They wanteda real peae, bled oi- wiisdom and -justice, and then they would breathe ,more freely once more, and ret-urnonce more to the pursuits of peae. He bad been asked in- the conrse of his can't'aas "Are you a fizm Protestant?" and he had- replied, "I am, and no miustake": -(Cheers. These were timue when every one who was so must be determined and watch-- ful, because Protestantism was -subiect to the subtle approachea of one of the most - dangerous enemies of hnan iber. (Cheers.} He had nailed his colours to the mat til they or he hiaself were shot away, and if the good ship went down, ho would go with her. (Cheers.) He would not use harsh words to his' Roman Catholic friends, but the Maynooth question was a most serious one. It belonged to a elass of questions which arose out of the excess of liberty which the people of this country enjoyed, and it therefore required, Eke them, to be dealt with wisely and deliberately, "roaletfuit quode .firs non debest" Had he bee a member of the Legislature when that grant was made, he would hive opposed it strenuously;. but at this time of day there were great difficulties to be overcome in deAling with it. He was pledged to nothing and when that question camn on, though his constituents might ntot bear him spceaki-he wras not going into the house as a tinlding cymbal, as a chatterer, for that would I disgesttShe good sense of the electors of Mi&hrst (cheers);butbe wished for an honest inquiry into the state of the fgrat, and whatever conclusibj s be conscientiously arrived at thereon he wroud endeavour fearlessly to act ut to. He bad given no pledge, and had not been asked for any, and that generous confdence be would never forget. iCheers.) He reproeated not only Conservatives, bult Liberals-not ouly Protestants, but Catholics-not only Christians, but Jews. Ee was a devoted son and member of the Church of England, and no object was dearer to his heart. dothing,d therefore, was more painful to him than to see the differences that bad arisen within her bosom in the conflict [betwveen hlberty and authority. It gave bim exquisite pin to see these questions-some touching the foumdations of that many of thesge difficul,TtiEes wouald bef cleare away f thved members of the church lokdmore to Points of coincidence and less to points of divergence. (Hear, hear.) In the course of his canvass he had been asked what view he etook of the question of church-rates. That was also a subject bristling with difficulties, but they must be dealt with somehow. He wouldc enter the House of Commons as a friend of the church, watchful lest the thin end of the wedge should be slipped in, and any attempt made to separate tne vital connexion between Church and State. He would give what assistance Le could as a churchman and a lawyer to any mant who would settle the question and i remove from people's eyes that bone of contention. There was another question of great difficulty, on which he was inflexible, the preservation of the character of a Christian Legislature- 'Be never would consent to admit the Jews into Parliament. He would Permit them to execute our laws, but not to make them. On the observance of the Sabbath also he was, as at present advised, equally inflexible. He would not open the Crystal Palace or any other plac of public amusement. Godforbidweshouldeverhaveaparisia Sabbath in this country.' On thie subject of religious education he had thought and written for years,and would warmly co-operate with men of every party who wished to promaote it. The middle-classes had his-best and dearest pathies, and the lower orders would ever find in Samuel warren an affectionato brother, watching their interests with the utmost solicitude. (Cheers.) - All rmeasues tendingtopromote tepinernce would have his steady su not He administered justice, as recorder at over 90,Oo0ipeoiple, and- he had ample opportunity of seeing the evilsot intemperatce. Every,qaestion that came before the House for law reform would have his steady, earnest support.. The interest of literatue aho would claim his cOnstant attention. He had never written or saidd an ill- atured wOrd against any human being, nor ha his hand ever traced a line which at his dying hour he would wish blotted out. Ie considered that applying the Income-tax to fixed and fluctuating incomes equally was an act of spohation; and he would therefore watch that tax closely. He had personal friends on the Ministerial side of the House and even in the Governmnent. He was no enemy of lord P'almerston's, though the lame of the noble Iced had been used in the borough during his can-ass in a way which he was persuaded the noble lord knew nothing about, He wonld give Laid Palmerston in his Present position a rnserous hut guarded support. (Hear, hear.) God forbid that any vote or vord of his should add to the difficulties of a Goverment trying to extricate this mighty empire from the Jaws of war ' Mr. Cobden was one of his constituents, and when he canvassd him hxe was receiosed with great cordialityandkindness. "Ofcourse,"sahe, "y know vhov; much we differ, but I shall be gla to see you in thle House of Commons." At present he dId not see his -way through many of the difficltties which pbli affairs presented, but he would see and hear and judge for the best, as his constitue-nts had a right to requir of him. Ie was deternined never to utter a harsh word in the House, and to avoid petty personalties and rancorsm vituperation. language of the kIdnd was not in his vocabulary, and he would carry in his heart the saying, " Let your moderation beknownofalzmeyL" (Cheers.) Hodeslred toenterparli2meut with the fear of God in an bhones English heart, determined byGod'sa blessing to do his duty.. (Cheers.) The proceedings terminated with the usual vote of thanks to the returzning-officer. EDINsBURGHL NOMMMATION OF CANIDATES, The nomnination of candYidates for t-he representation of Edinburgh took place on Thursday. Ir.

Mr. LOGAIi,i a lively spec, seconded the nomination. The other candidate, he said=ae forward under a coalition of sevenl different parties, and, never since the day MTash entered the Ark, had so mnany beasts, clean and unclean, been seeni together. Mr.- W. 3'ChIsE proposed Mlr. Brown Douglas, recommending him as a Christian and a Protestant, whio would act u3POnProtestant views in the teeth of any Government.- The comparative youth of Mr. Douglas would also, enable hima to represent them efficienitly, while Mlr. Black was now arrived At that time of life that his friends should give bina, not labour, but repose. Mr. J GIBSON secondedl the nomination. He trusted it wouldl be founid, to use the learned gentleman's simifle, that tewere in the ar-k of safety, while the other party were en thpit ofbeing overwhelmed,with the Delug~e. MTr. Bx.sCx then addressed the assemiblage.

II Eoporting this infjstice, the Voluntaries sadrifice all prmciple, resort to the wea ons of persecution, add insult to inu_y, endanger . the peace of Ireland, ani give a foul stab to Protestantism, and shut the ears and the hearts of the people to the reception of the truth.

THE NAVTY, dc., ESTIBATES * A-e estimates for the ensuing financial year are out. The sum total that will be required for the servies of the ensuing year, 1856-57, amounts to 12,148,64?.., being anet increase of 291,1351. over the year 1855-56. The iterns are as follow, viz. :-Wages to seamen and marine, 3,237,8931.; victuals for the same, 1,434,7301L the Admiralty-office, 138,3991.; the Royal Navl Coast Volunteers, 20,0001.; the scientific branch, 58,9821. ; Her Mfajesty's home establishments, 153,7951., anditheeabroad, 36,4941.;wages to artificers employed in the establishments at home, 1,190,3091., andto those employed abroad, 109,913N.; naval stores, &c., for the bilding and repairs of ships, 3,447,3511.; new works and improvementsiin the yards, 864,334.; medicines and medical stores, 70,0001.; miscelaneous services, 88,9721. ; halfpay, 655,4211.; mifitary pensions and allowances, 404,36=3.; and civil pensiotis and allGwances, 147,6851. Thus it will be seen that the effective service requires a sum of 10,851,1721., and the noneffective, one of 1,297,4691. The above may be called the Navy Estimates "Proper." Next follows the estimate for the ('Transport service and prisoners of war," which will entail a total charge of 6,971,5371.-a formidable addition to the sulm required for the general navy estimates. The greater part of this estimate (6,829,9221.) is for "xfreight, &c., for the Army and Ordnance Departments," the sum total required for prisoners of war amounting to 125,8001. only. The Post-office Department (packet service) will entail a charge on the-nation for the ensuing finaneial year of 756,487., against 755,2S91. last year. Of this sumn 25,0001. is required for the lrish mails, 4,000!. for the Channel ]slands, 15,500!. for the lZench, 2D,5001. for the Peninsular 172,8401. for the American, 240,000l. for the West Indian, 25,000?. for the Western American mnails, 21,5001. for the West Coast of Africa, and ,14l,414L. for the Overland Indian, ,c. These three branches of the Naval Estimates anaLke, together, a grand total of 19,876,675L The Army and Ordnance Estimates have yet to appear.

LAW REPOBR. P OLIS' COURT. CHAwcm .-N REn. 7 a OF TllINI . THTY MASTR AND LLWS OF TRINfl' COLLEGE. CAM~BRIDGE. I-eiorc C RASR o t Me YOLLS.) 'Thi was an information filed by the Attorney-General, at the selation of some ofThe inhabitants of uttox'eter, in Staf. fordshire, aggainst the Master indFellows of Trinity College, Cambridge, under the following circmautances --The Rev. Thomas Allyn,be his will, dated in 1558, gave certain prperty tD the Felows and scholars of Trinity College, in trust, to support out of the proceeds three free grammar sclhbols-ono at Uttoxeter, anotlher at Stone, in Wt=frdshire, and a thirdat Stevenage in HertfordAshire. The rent of the property at-the time of the testator's death amounted to about SW. s-year, but in the course of years had sogreatly increased as to amount at the p resent time to several thom. ands a-year. The College had supported the schools, as directed by the testator in his will. ; but, after pro. a'idin for a such sustenance for the schools as the liitradFellows of the College considered proper, there wns a considerable sum remaining over, whych it was contended the College was beneficially entitled to. It appeared also that the lLster andFellows of Trinity College were of opinion that the grammar schools directed to be maintained by the testator were to be restricted to children belonging to the Church of England. It was to protest against these iiews of the College, both as to the surplus funds and to the character of the schools, that the present information was filed, the prayer of it being that the Courh iould make a declaration to the effect that the schools were entitled to have any surplus therec miht be appledfor their benefit, that u scheme might be dtrected for their improvement, and that the childreu of Dissenters migthe declaredn ob cntitled to come in and share the thatatess county, as wcll as those who belonged to the Church of Englaned. The ASTER of thc PRoars held that it wa e^ vident, frosnthe intention expressed in the dll of the teshttor *thathe intended Trinity College should benefitbyany sur plus that inighit remain after te spec;fic directions of his 'will had beenl complied wvith; buat ordered that the case should stand overuntilthe Master a;^d Fellowrs of Trinity College had been c6nsuilted 'as to enlarging the sCO^e and character of.thceschools, soalb to admit the childiren of D)issenters, inasmcauh as the Court considered that the teatntor intended that the schools should not be confined to any partieiular class or. sect, but, as :free grammar schools, sheould be open to the admittaneof the childr-en geerally of the inhabitan ts of the places named, withoult respect tyo their being lloman Catholics, Protestants or Dissenters.' The Solicitor-GeneraL. MIr. BI. Palmer, MIr. Piounell, Mr. Follett, MIr. Evans, Mr. Wickens, 14r. Pemberton, Mr Giffard, and Mr. Dnnne appeared in the case.
VICE-CHANCELLORS' COURTS. FrmTL 7- JiA" Y. kiAla. (Bcfore Yce-Uhancdlor SirS. T. JXEnW sLsr.) This wfas amotion to stay a31 proceedings, to dismiss the bill, and that the solicitgr whohad filed it might pay the costs, the ground being that it had been filed without autho?lty. bIr. ROXBunOE was heard in support of the motion, which is still proceeding. (Before VWe-Chanedor Sir Jounx SiuART.) MARKER V. BIRCH. The Court was occupied the -whole day in hearing a motion on behalf of the defendant in this case, that certain books of account should be taken as prinud facie evidence of the truth of the matters therein contained. The motion did not involve any point of general interest. Isir. Malims, l!r. Greene, and Mr. Sidney Smith supported the motion, and Mr. Craig and Xr. Francis Webb resisted it. (Before YCi-(7TancelNor Sir W. P. WOOD.) THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL V. THE TOWNSEIP OF LUTON LOCAL BOARD OF HEAILLTH. Mir. ROLT and Mr. CAnINS moved for an injunction to restrain the Luton Board of Health from permitting the sewers and drains to empty themselves into the river Iea, and from otherwise polluting the river, or keeping the sewers and drains so as to be a nuisance or injurious to pubEc health, and also from opening any new drains or sewers communicating with or discharging thaemselves into the river, or any opernings in sewers dready communicating with the river. The plaintiff, Mr. Leigh, at whose relation the information had been filed, was the owner of Luton Hoo Park, in the immediate neighbourhood of Luton, which extended for nearly three miles along the river Lea, vvhich fowed through the town. By the Public Health Act, 19s84 all sewers were vested in the local board of health, withcertain powers as to their enlargement or discontinuance. Between 1S48 and 1850 the Luton local board of health discontinued the dumBwells and cespooLs by which the town had been previousFly drained, and enlarged the sewers, carrying into such sewers covered d drains, in substittios for the dumbwellsand cesspools.n 18E3 additional drains were constructed and an additional main sewer, by which nmeans a large adiktional area of sewage, to the extent of 10,500 yards, was earried into the Lea. The effect of this addition to the se7age connected with the Lea was, awording to the statements in the information, such as to poUute the waters and reader them unfit for domestic or drinkdng pnses, destroying nearly al the fishnearthe townL 1inadditiontotheordinarysewage,therefuse and scourings from the straw plait manufx*ories of the town, and from the chyraical matters use therein-oxalic acid andbrimstone-wsre carried into the river, the effect of which wasa constant exhalation generating su*lhmretted y. drogen and other noxious gases. The plaintiff had complained in tarch, 1854, of the pollution of the river, and inthe course of the negotiation which took place between himself and the local board of health they stated that they had in contemplation a new scheme of drainage, whc would divert the entire sewage ef the towln from the river. The plaintiff stated that he had been induced to delay taking any proceedings against the defendants by the pendency of thesenegotiations; but, nosatisfactoryresult having been arrived at, the plaintiff had on the 13th of December, 1855, liled the information. Evidence was adduced to a considerable extent, from which it appeared that above the town the water was still clear and unpolluted ; that in that portion of the river which flowed through the town," and was influenced by the sewers, the water was very foul and offensive, with auantities of feculent matter floating on the surface and ad. hering to the sides, with an accumulation of mnud varying in depth from 6 inches to 3 feet &inches; that a portion of the nver which had been used by the farmers for 30 years for sheepwashing was, since the spring of 1855, no longer available for that purpose, as the sheep came out of the water dirtier than when they were thrown in. Evidence bad been adduced orn behalf of the defendants to show that the water was not polluted to such an extent as to render it unpleasant to the taste; that the rroportion of sewage water to pure water was, according to analysis, as 1 to 800; and that no fish had existed in that part of the river which flowed through the town for the last 15 years, while the injury to the plaintiffs water and fish was very trifing, if at all perceptible. It was also stated that the effect of oxalic acid and the clhymical bleaching ingredients was to neutralize the bad effect of the ordinary sewage. MIr. W. 35. JAMSIE and Mr. FooEs, for the defendants, contended that the plaintiff had precluded himself by his delay from obtaining the injunction sought for. It was admitted that the river had been polluted by the outfall of se e log previous to the exis-tence of the local board of health, the river, from the position of the town in a basin of hills, being the natural channel for the drainage of the town, and the increase of fouling matter, though that had been greatly exaggerated, was fairly attributable to the geat increase mn population in Luton. The plaintiff had imself contributed materially to the nuisance by damming up the water at one of his mills, and thus rendering the w ater stagnant. At all events, the nuisance already exise. lag had not been aggravated to such an extent as to entitle the plaintiff to stop the proceedings of the board of health. The VICE-CHASOELIOR saidthattheplaintiff was entitled to an injunction as to the second palt of his application with respect to openingany new drm or sewers communieating with, or discharging themselves into the river Lea, or from executing any works whereby the sewage passing into the river may be increased. With respeet to restraining the defendants from permitting the existing sewers to empty themselves into the Lea le had some doubt, from the impossibility of providing for the drainage of the tovwn by any other means between the present time and the hearing. As to the plaintiff's right, it was the simplest case possible,the river flowedthrough bispark, wasa private watercourse, and his own Property, and could not be compared with the case of the Thames. By section 145 of the Public Health Act the defendants were prohibited from using, injurimg, or interfering with any watercourse, stream, river, Lc., in which the owner or occupier of any lands, Lc., shall or maybe interested without consent in writing first had and obtained. In the present case the owner of the river had not given his co^eent in writing to any of these proceedings, and whatever rights by way of easement -mght have been previously acquired by the inhabitants, the board of healt, a new bo:Yy, bad acquired no sich prescriptive rights, nor had they any right to do the acts complained of without the consent in writing of the owner. It remained to be considered whether the plaintiff, not having given his consent in writing, had waived his right by acquiescence or laches, it being contended that he had come too late to obtain an interlocutory inuncmtion. His Honour, after going through the circumstances detailed, in the affidavits upon the question of delay, said that he thought it would be very di£acaltat the hearing to szay that the plaintiff had precluded himself by laches or waived his right; but that was a queston which would remain for the hearing. As to the nuisance to the public and the plaintiff, there was very little doubt that the evil had been enormously ag-ravated since the board of heailth had been constituted. It might be trae that the population had greatly-increased, but, as he bad already observed, no sach prescriptive rights were conferred upon the board of health asmughtbeen.Joyed by individual inba bitants.' Before the constitution of that body the drainage had been discharged by a surface area of 250 yards, whereas the extent ef the sewerage was now 10,500 yards. To mainta-n that a vast quantity of noxious matter had not been discharged into the river from this immense increase of sewerage was a proposition whieh swould require the strongest evidence. there was strong evidence, on the other hand,}as tothe nuisance. I t was a very stron fact that the water was so poluted that the farmers had 'ound ittimpossible to iva.h sheep in the river for the first time in lZnot in the middle of summer, but early mn May. The evidence of Dr. Arnott was also strong as to the amount of pollution, wbsile Professor Way, on behalf of the defendants, merely spoke of the relative proportions of sewvage and pure water, and that the state of the river was not worse than in many other towrns. The evidence of the inhabitants,who hadtastedthe water, and considered it perfectly good, really amounted to nothing. No doubt, the evil hadhbeen on tbe increase for some time, but the addi. tion of sen-e had been so immense since the extence of the boardf o health, andthe nuisince'wnsso'fullyproved, that the injunction mvust be granted as to the execution E any future works, as above stated.

Sir F. Tssxsomi resumed his opening for the defendant in this important case, which, it will be remembered, occupied several day-s dung last term, and involves a question between guardian sand ward as to the settlement of accounts and the execution of certain deeds of release and mortgage by the plaintiff on attaining his majority, the mortgage having been created by him for the purpose of raising money to meet the excess of expenditure over receipts durmngisminority. Thelearned'counsel,afterreferimngtoandcoommenting onthecorrespondence andevidenceatmuchlength, concluded his address by calling on the Cout to put an end to this interesting and painful case by dismissing the bill vith costs. It was perfectly clear that everything had been done by MIr. Strachan with the most perfect bonasfdies, and with the *pure and single object of advancing the interests of his wan . The improvements on the estate had all been planned and effected under the beast possible advice, and if the expenditure had exceeded the original expectations of the defendant, every one must feel -and knowhow difficult it was to stop short in carrymg out improvements vhen once they had begun. As to the execution of the release, it was impossible not to feel that the plaintiff was a young man of more than ordinary capacity and intelligence; that he was possessed of a most independent spirit; and that he was fully aware of all the improvements which had been goig on, and of the debt which had been incurred in carry2gthem out. Therelease was, in fast, the pure emanation of the plaintiffs own will, executed with fou knowledge of all the facts, and most certainly free from any improper influence on the part of M1r. Strachan, who therefore felt both morally and legally justified in insisting on thatrelease as an answer to ithe lplamtift'sj claim. As to what had Itaken place since the release, the circumstances showed a clear ratification by the plaintiff express and implied,-er. press by payment of interest on the mortgage debt for five yearS; imved by his frequent indications of satisfaction at what had been done, and up to his taling the extraordinary step of fllingthis bill by his conductto Dir. Strachan. Under all the circumstances he would urge upon the Court that the cases which had been cited for the plaintiff as mark-ing the extreme jealousy of the Court in all tranctios between guardian and ward could have no application to the present case, andthat the prayer of the bill could not be acceded to. The evidence for the defendant was then resumed.
COURT OF QU=S2 BENC1, WEsnImsnp, Fim. S, T1E ODEE1 V. LOCKWOOD AND OT5S. (Sitigs at Wfisi PuJ22L, before Lord C.oBELL and ( nmmr., - ..r , . Idr. Corier and Mr. Charnock appeared for the prosecution, and l,tr. Hawlins for the defendants. This was an indictment which charged the Mlessrs. Lothwood, house agents in Conmaught-terrace, and anotherperson with a forcible entry upon certain premises, situate at No. 90, Great Jumction-terrace. The prosecutor was a person named New, who went by the name of Charles Kimig, and cariTed on busine.i as a photographic artist at No. 226, Oxford-street. It appeared that in December, 1854, the prosecutor had taken a lease of the preniises i-n q3estiort for three years at a rent of 200. per annum, payable monthly. He there opened an exhibition, consisting of dissolving view. tabnu zrnans, c., enlivmed by music and songs. The rent wvas regularly paid down to September, 1855, hut on the 25th of October he made defanlt, in consequence, as he mid, of hearing that the landlord, Henry Howden, bad become a bankrupt. The Mdessrs. ,ockwood, the defendants, who had acted as agents in letting the hot;e, insisted on the Prosecutor paying his rent, stating that the Henry Biowden who had signed the agreement and had become bank;rupt was only acting as trustee for his mother, who wias beneficially interested. The preseentor, however. refused to pay, and, e.xpecting that a distress wrould be levied for the rent in na-rear, he carefully lockedup the premises by day, but in the evening o-cned his exhibition as saL. On the 6th of December thie prosecutor ascertained that some one had got into the house by a window. At 10 o'clock on the morning of the 10th of December the two defendants, accompanied by a man named Holly, went to the house with a crowbar, and attempted to force an entrance. After some time they effected an entrance by putting the crowbar in a crevice between the shutters. Th then seized everythimg, includ chandeliers and es, and carried thmaway. On cross-examination by Mr. law-kins the prosecutor stated that when he took the premilses he told the defendants he wanted them for the exhibitiou of a panorama of Australia and the Holy Land. dissolving views, b hehad since exhbited " tabceaunx v irans,n including a monkey -wvdth a long t-i, -which hopped round his cage on the end of his tail, and performed other wonderful feats, such as standing on his head, &c. The charge for admission was 2d., and liL for the reserved seats, and the exhibition was frequented by a large number of boys,and young girls, froml O to 16 years of age. A mas -was in pssession, under a distress for rent, from the 5th to the 8th of December, when he, was turned out. The prosecutor stated that he sometimes performed the part of an avocat,' that his real name was " ,New," and' that he had adopted the name of " Konig," because an English n3me would not do for a "w wizard." It appeared from the evidence of one of the prosecutor's men, who had been left in the house, that on the 5th of December an entrance had been effected by the staircase window bv the defendants and a broker, the latter of whom took asn inventory, and remained till the 5th, when he was turned out. He alsa confirmed tho evidence given by the prosecutor as to the forcible entrance oii the 10th. Mr. HAwimiS. for the defendants, sid he should prove that the defendants were justified in what they had done. They had got into the house on the 5th of December, without breaking any fastenin'- and levied a distress. The man in possession was an the 8th violentlv thrown out into the street; and on the 10th, whic.h was a MIonday, the defendants bad gone to the house and forced an entrancea proceedi. wshich the learned counsel contended the law justified. They took with them twlo policemenuto prev.ent sany brech of the Peace, and used only fiO mu ch force as was ecsayt .pnthe outer door. L ord Cas'su. several times intimated his opmiion that the proceeding could not beso justified. The case, howvever, prloceeded, and it was proved that, nith the assistance of a colicemsa, who lived in an ematy houtse adjowein, an entrance was effected by a winhow which had not been fastened. A distress wras then levied and a man left in possession, but at a late hour on Saturday naight he was forcibly ejected. On the following Monday the paties went, accompanied by tro policemen, and brote open the shutters as above described. lord CABIsELL said the evidence which had bess given did not justify the conduct of the defendants, thougvh tho offeach, Inder the cimprcstance, was almost venial; and if they were convicted he should pass oany a triflinB sentence. r. HAe s3 said he s afraid the defendants, if convicted, would be lEable, under their recogkzances, topay the cstis of the prosecution. Ultimately the defendants were found Gz'Wy; and Lord CBan acL told them the sentence was that they be rmned each Is., and be inprisoned ntil the fine wtas paid.

Thc defendant as tothe trespass tothe land, pleaded that it was his oen soal and freehold, and demnrred to the count uponthe distress. It appeared from the plainto evidence that at.

This was an issue out of the Court of Chancery, directed to try the validity of the execution of a wilL Mr. Serijeant Byles, Mr. Fleming (of the Chancery bar) and Mr. White appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Smith, Q.C., and ,r. P'hipson for the defendant. The question raised was whether the will of a lady named Lucy Williams, the daughter of a clergyman in Suffolk. was executed according to the requirements of the WillM Act, and whether or not she had signed the will in the presence of the two attesting witnesses.. The testatrix lived at Beadham, in Suffolk, for 18 or 20 years, and died there on the 8th of March, 1854, at the age of 70, possessed of property worth about 10,OO. She had herself written out her will-on the 6th of March, 15 and had got the carpenter and blacksmith of the vilage to cone and attest its execution as witnesses. These twomnen found her sitting in her room at a table, with the will he. fore her, and sle directed them where to siga their names, and also to add tleir occupations and addresses; and they Loth signed the will and left the room. She died three ,ears aterwards, and her will was proved in the common form, an old and faithful servant named Shribley being her executor, and having a beneficial interest under the wilL Theheir-at-law,notbeing satisfiedthat the will had been sufficiently executed, the will wasadministered in the Court of Chancery, aud that Court had directed this issue. The two attesting witnesses, on being called, prove their attestation. They had both signed their 2naesto the will in her presence and in the presenceeof each other; and it seemed to them to he in the same condition then as now, but neither of them could say that they saw the testatrix sign it, or whether her name was there when they signed the wilL This was the plaintif's case. Mr. hL SaTsi- submitted that there vwas no evidence to go to thA jury. His LOP.DSIIIP thought there was, and could not reserve Ihe noint, as it was an issue out of Chancery. Noone coula doubt but that the signature of the testatrix was on the will when the witnesses signed it, and it was sufficient if she aclnowledged her signature, which, however, must be there before the acknowledgment. If the jury, looking at the vwilL thought the signature must have been there be-. fore the witnesses signed it, and that, being there, she aeknowledged her signature by handing it to them for their signatuAre, he should rule that that was sufficient. 'The jury, on looking at the will, immediately found a -erdict for the plaintiff. K The will, which was given in evidence,was ofgreatlength, in the testatrix's own handwriting, and very eccentric, the greater part of it being flled with directions about her own funeral, the ceremonies attending it, and the making of her grave and tombstone. She directed herself to be placed in her coffin Ig on one side, in her usual night clothing, with a flannel dressing-gown over it, and to be tucked in with a blanket, without any removal of her rings or earingu8s. She then directed certain letters to be placed in her coffi, and on it the inscription, "Lucy Williams, born 19th November, 1780," with the date of her death. She directed hersel not to be buried for 14 days-that the undertaker should be a stranger from Wickham Market, andl that her funeral should be conducted like her late mother's. Then follow directions as to the making of the grave, which was to be brick, arched, with an oak panelling on the south sde. This was to be covered over with rubbed York stone and enclosed with hzammered pallisadig. and ^ratings were to be placed on the tomb to admit light and air. She then directs the pay of the bearers who carry her remains, that a hearse and four horses handsomely and fully caparisoned, covered with black cloth and lined with white calico, should cenvey her to the grave, and that when buried her burialplace should " be kept free from toads." In fact5 the poor old lady's mind, even inthe contemplation of herown death, seems to have been fJIed with the p omps and vanities" of the world; and her own particular lkes and dislikes seem to have beer carefully provided for when her poor dust could appreciate them no more. The will then gave certain legaies to her relions, but left the bulk of her property to other persons. This case finished the cause list, and the Courb rose.
COURT OF EXCHEQUER. FE& 7. ;:PECIAL VArER. (Sittings in Banco. HIUTCHM iOl V. GILLSlP This was a demurrer by the defendants to the plaintiff's declaration in an action to recover 1,0901. 18s. 4d. on an order of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Counca, made in an appeal from a judgment of the Provincial Court of Quebec, and the question raised for the decision of this Court was, whether any action could be maintained in this coantry under the circumstances of the case. It appeared from the allegations of tthe declaration that In the y-ear 1S295 a suit arose in the Comrt of King's Bench m Mfontreal between the defendants and Messrs. SpraB and William Hutchinson, in the course of which the ben plaintiffs sought to attach certain proerty and moneys then being in the hands of one Lamb, as beg the property of the then defendants, by a pirocess analogous to the system of attachment in the Lord Mayor's Court of Tondon. Upon that the present plaintiff, who had been a partner of William Hutchinson, presented a petition of intervention, claiming that the property so attached belonged to him by virtue of an arrangement consequent on a dissolution of partnership. The Court of Montreal gave judgment in that interlocutory suit in favour of the claimant, and ordered the property to be delivered up to hin, but the plaintifiM in the original suit appealed from that judgment to the Provinciil Court at ueboc, by whom it was reversed, and the claimant ordered to pay the costs and bring the propery into court again. mHr. utchinson thereupon appeda in136 to the Queen in Council, by whom the matter was referred to the Judicial Committee of the Privy CounciL That body, in 1S3S, in the exercise of its powers, ordered a reference of the partnership accounts to be gone into before Mr. Serjeant Channel, as upon the dne adjustment thereof depended the ques. tion whether the title to theproperty in the "intervention uit!' vwas m the now plaintiff or in the defendants in the originalstit at Montreal. The learned serjeant having re. ported in 183 that the plaintiff was entitled to the property, the Judicial Committee so reported n its turn to the Queen, and ordered that the decree of the Court of Quebec should be varied accordingly, and that the now defendants should p~ay to the now plaitiff ,0901 a 1s 4d his cosetaof theappeal aindreference, rind, in accordance wiit that report, a, formal judgment was eventually proniounced byEHer Majesty, an end being thus put to litigation, which proved, as Mur.

The miatter being thtus determined in favour of the claimant, and in accordance with the judgnent of the Court of Montreal, the now defendants were appliend to to pay the costs, but, as they declined to do so, an application was made to the Privy Council for an attachmnent, buxt Lord Wensleydale, who then presided, declined to exercise that undoubted power of the Privy Council, on the ground, as we understood, that as the parties resided and carried on busiieA in Canada, the enforcement of the udgent ad btte beemited o ta colony.t Nof good the~ ~ ~ ~~~~~~~i cssudrtes.ttsSan4the costsa there. eut,he OwVer, wi-ould mset roha.e bee Larred at iearenai fnd, af til derpther da the declaratima and e oternd to than an action wo thiscu upon th e judgment .o 0th as it was in truth the order of the QueeP in Council, and not of the Judicial Committee, which bedyalone had power over the costs under the. statutes 3d and 4th W-illiam IV., c. 41, and 6th and 7th Victoria, c. 28.

Th right of the plaintiff to sue the defendants, therefore, grew out of their legal duty to pay, andI did not depend on the question whether the.Privy Council had or liad not means of enforcing its orders. In the next place, he argued that the judgment was absolute and final, and, being so, was enforceable by action, and as for the refusal of Lordl Wensleydale to is-rue an attachment, that was 3 matt-er of discretion on his part, which could not miiUtate aggainst the undoubted right of the plaintiff to enforce paymenit of the costs. by this action.

Both the attesting witnesses had forgotten the transaction, but when the will was exhibited to them they recognized their signatures; and one of them deposed that he was so well acquainted -with the requisite forms for the due execution of a withat he was sure they must have been complied with, or he shozld not have signed it. The case was argued some months since, but the Court, with a view of saving further expense, reserved its judgment, and recommended -that the personsinteresteed should come to an amicable arrangement. The learned JUDGE novr pronounced for the will and decreed the costs of Mrs. Stanton, by whom it had been op. posea, to be paid out of the estate.

It is utterly untrue that I charged any procuration fee. The office pays me for prearing the bonds;* but that 15 guineas is allp1releved from the borrower. By Mr. REED.-Tho bankrupt's brother George was in my office a twelvemonth. He has since been in practice on his own account. I beard the bankrupt's evidence at the lastsitting, and 'was so ntterly astonishe at the atrocity of the charges he made that I made no attempt to answer them until I was prepared with statements and documents to do sO comp~letely. I 'wrote to the papers toecontradict the bankrupt's statement, and Georeeliese did the same. I did not seek to iduce Frederick Leslie to 'write a letter in contradiction, by stating that if he would do so I would tear up abll on which he was liable for 2001&, and that ho i should not beopposed in thelnsolventCourt. He wasthen in the Queen's Bench. I prepared a letter for him to'sign, but he refused to do so till he had consulted his solictor. He promised to sign it if his solicitor approved it. I 'wanted those letters for my vindication fromw the bankrupt's charges. 1believed the truLth of the state. ments 'which the bankrupt dictated to me in the proposal.i I did not then know of F.

I believethe statement to be true thatthe loan was required by the bankrupt for the extension of his business. I did not then know that 1501. was going to F.

He did not, as solicitor to the company, in- I form them of this. He did not discount a bill for 1501. on the 4th of November. Frederick leslie gave him no securityeexcept a memorandum on the back ofthe note. ReferringtohisbooksDof the4th of November, he found anentry, "AdvancedFrederickLesliel50L ;drawingmemorandumand obtainingFrederickLeslie'ssignaturethereto."Thememorandum given Frederick Leslie was destroyed. He hadpreviously discounted four or five bills (renewals) for Frederick Leslie. There was one bill in October, 18&5, for 1501. Frederick Ieslie now owed him 2201. He would swear that he made np the 101. by cash and discount. He paid something like 1O per cent. on a three months' bilL He never sawFrederick Lesi's schedule in the Insolvent Court. He went there to watch the case, and instructed counsel to appear for him. 151. 15s. was paid for his charges altogether. This was not as a bonus. H bhad been Aspinwall's referee. On his oath he did not know that the check for 2001. was intended for Aspinwall. The accountproduced is the account he showed to the direcotrs. His checkbook did not contain an entry of Dec. 19, 1854, for 1051.; there was 1201. on the 16th of December. He did not send a check for 1051. to the Union Bankfor change; he believed not. As the referee of Aspinwall he communicated with him. He had never had any previous transaction with him. Ho is not acting for the TraveUers in this matter; but he is still the solicitor fog that office. They had not given him any graceful notice that he might retire. He did not know that Frederick Leslie was a surety at the time he fined up the paper;- nor did he that Owen WaS. He vwas not solicitor for the English and Scottish. He had threatened to sue Owven twvo years beefore he became his referee for three or four guineas. He got the money. Long after that he introduced him into the office. The smallness of the amount was the reason Owen did not pay without being sued. When Frederick leslie had borroweed the 1501. of diml he did not think that would diminish his chances of pa ment. He did not ask Lewis to become a referee. He was refexee for Owen and Aspinwall, whom he believed to be responsible. The directors had since saidthey should have been happy to advance 1,0001. on such security. By Mr. BAGLs.m-Hehadno object in view but to benefit the office. Mr. Nichols, exained, said he was clerk to3Ir. Chappell in 1854. MEr. Chappell asked for a proposal paper, The bank-rupt said he was in business on his own account, and had been so for five years. He remembered 3Mr. Chappell Diring him two ol.-notes. He gave them to Mlr. Frederick By MIr. REED.-He happened to be in the room when the bankrupt said he bad been in business five years. The conversation was brought to his mind by his having a good memory. It was on the 10th of November when the two .-notes were givento Mr. rederick Did not know Mr. Chappel had been down to the prison to see Frederick. Did hot know that it would be inconvenient for MIr. Chappell to produce Frederek. His Hoxoui said the bankrupt's conduct to the Travellers Society had been such as to make one doubt what klind of credit to attach to his statements. If he meant to screen himself by stating that he made the representations he did at the instigation of his attorney he would be very much deceived, for he must know that he ought notto do that which was wrong at the instigation of another. He saw no reason to come to the conclusion that Mr. Chappell bad acted the dishonest part imputed to him. If an attorney could thus act, he would have but little chance of remaining on the rolls. He believed that it was not so. The bankrupt should have called Frederick Leslie, if he had expected to be believed. Why had he not done so, instead of cal1ing upon Mr. Chappell to bring him forward as a witness ? Mr. Chappei swore that he never saw such a bill as 1601., or knew that it existed. If the bankrupt should corroborate certain items the Court mipht be inclined to believe him ; but it could not do so on his own unsupported testimony. Itwas material to know what had become of a portion of his money. A sum of nearly 1,0001. was not to be accoanted for by an assertion that it had been expended. The bankrupt hadno domestic expenses to incur, and yet he had, according to his own statement, been expending at the rate of 2501. a-year in some way or other of which no account was given. As men of the world they knew the ways there were for a young maan thus expending money; hut still a bankrupt must be re- quired to do more than simply say he had expended the| money. He recollected the ease in which a bankrupt was committed to Prison who refused to account for the manner | mn'which he had expended 1001. As regarded the matter connected with the loans from the insurance companies, it was unfortumate that Mr. Chappoli had held inconsistent offices. To besocitorfor the company, surety, and referee he mnust be more thanmato do his duty to al parties. It mriht have been better, also, under the circumstances, if he h not acted in this case as solicitor to the assignees.

CENTAL CRIMINAL COURT, Feb. 8. I.nT.r -p (Beforc Mr. JUs5ice WIGErIN.) T Ba-r DR. VAsGnAs. The Rev. John Vaughan, formerly the incumbent of St. Matthew's district church, Brixton, surrendered to take his trial for felony, in having knowingly and wilfully made atfalse entry in the registry of burials belonging to that parnsh. The rev. gentleman having been placed in the dock, ho pleaded " Not gnilty" to three indictments, each alleging a separate offence of the kind above stated. Serjeant Wilkins, Mr. Clarkson, and lMr. Clark conducted the prosecution on behal of the churchhwardens of the parish; the Attornev-General, Mr. Ballantine, and MIr. Psideaux, were counsel for the defence. The first case proceeded with charged the prisoner with having nmdo a false entry in the register in relation to the burial of Jane Webb. Mr. SerjeantWsniss, in opening the case tothejury, said that although the facts were very few, and the case in itself was very simple, yet, inor4er to make it appreciable and inteligible, it would be necessay to ask their attentionto a 'few preliminary observations which he felt it neCesEary to make. The prosecultion was instituted -under an' act of Parlianentof the lst ofWilliam. IV., sec. 20, which declaredi that any person3 who should knowingly-or wilfully insert or cause or permit to be inserted in any register of baptisrms, marriages, or bn_ials, any false entry of any matter relating to a marriage, birth, or burial, shall be deemed guilty of felony, and be subject to certain - punishments, in the discretion of the Court It was unnecessary for him to reumk upon the great impoitance of having all such registers as these correctly kept, because he was sure they could see that the interests of them all were involved in the matter, and that such documents would be of no value whatever if their correctness were at all doubted. From the very earliest dawn of divilinztion measures had been taken to prevent registers of this kind from bcing tampered with, and of late yer;s the matter had been looked upor. as so important that the Legislature had declared, as the jury had seen by the statute to which he had referred, the offence of tampering with suchregisters to amount to a felony. The learned serjeant then proceeded to state that the prisoner was in 1855 the incumbent of -St. Matthevws Church, Brixton; it WaS a district of Iambeth parish, and under the act lof Parliament certain fees were charged for burials, &c., the amount of which was doubled in the eases of persons who were non-resident. Haing explained that a portion of these fees went to the incumbent, a portion to the churchwardens, and another portion to the rector of Lambeth, he said he should now simply lay before the jury the facts of the case he was instructed to present to them, and he should do so without any conments, but 'should leave them, as men of business, to form their ownconclusions from those facts. On the 6th of June, 185, a person named Jane Webb, who lived at No. 53, Park-place, Parkroad, Claphiam, died, and the registrar of deaths in that district, appointed under the act of Parliament, gave a certificate of the death. The Claphan district was beyond the St. Matthew's district, and it would be only reasonable to suppose that the minister of that parish must have been well aware of this fact. It was the duty of the undertaler to give the certHficate obtained from the registrar to the ministei at the time of the interment, and he should show that when the deceased was buried Plummer, the undertaker, and who was at the time also parish clerk of St. Matthew's, gave the certificate and the double fees' that arose from the fact of the deceased being a non-resident, to Mitby, the sexton, and he handed over both the certificate and the money to the prisoner. He should show that upon this Dr. Vaughan 'made an entry, first in what was called a rough book, that was kept in the vestry, and afterwrards in the parish register, representing that the deceased had been bu, h was within St. IMatthew's district, and for vwhich interment only a single fee could be claimed, and a sumn of os. was stated to have been received as the ground fee, instead of w2., which was the sum actually paid. This was a short outline of the facts of the case, andhe would observe that the gravamen of the charge did not consist in a misappropriation of the money, but in making a false entry relating to a burial in the register of the parish. It was needless for him to say that the entry was false in a very important point, namdy, with regard to the residence of the deceased, and, if the fact were made out to their satisfaction, they would have only one duty to perform. The following evidence was then adduced: Miss Anne Webb said,-I live at 53, Park-place, Parkroad, Clapham. The deceased Jane Webb was my mother. She died on the 6th of June last at Park-place, Clapham. We went to the house in March before her death. Before that time we had lived in Park-crescent, Claphain . I was present when my mother died, and I attended her funeral. She was buried at St. Matthew's Church, BrEcton, MIr. Plummer was the undertaker. -By the ATTORoNEY-GsmRALL.-There was no particular reason foremploying Pluriner. - Miss Mary Anne Webb said,-I am another daughter of the deceased, and after her death I went to Mr. Frost, the registrar of the distriet, and gave him information with regard to my mother's death, and he gave me a p,apr. I gave the same par to the undertaker, Plummer. Hle was at the time parish clerk of St. Matthew's, Brixton. I paid forthe funeral expenses altogether. Thereweredouble fees charged forthe buriaL By mother was buried on Monday, the 11th of June. Mr. G. Eastman, the curate, performed the service. Mr. J. Frost, the registrar of births, &c., for the Clapham district, said,-I kinow Park-place, Clapham. It. is within my district. Iproduce my hook, in which I registered the death of Jane xVebb on the 9th of June, 1855. I produce a duplicate-of the-certiflicate I gave upon the occasion. By the ATro&\ -Y-GENEaAL.-Part of Acre-lane was formerly within my district, but it has since been caUed Parkroad. Park-place leads out of Park-road. Some of the old people still call the whole road Acre-lane. My district is about a qutrterof a mile in extent. Part of Acre-lane is in tanibeth parish. I don't know whether it iswtithS. Matthew's district. ' iiwithin the St. Re-examined.-My- district is confined to Clapham parishL John William Plumner said,-I am an undertaker, and was formerly-parish clerk of St. Matthew's,tlBrixton. I was the undertaker employed to bury the deceased. She was buried from Park-place, which is in the Clapham district. I received the registrar's certificate from one of the rdatives of the deceased. I gave that certificate to Maltby, the sexton, on the day of the burial, and paid himt i. 15s., which was a double fee. Mr. Eastman performed the service. I deducted 3s. 4&., a double fee to which I was entitled, before I paid Mlatby. On the morning of the funeral Isaw Dr. Vaughan in the vestry, and I saw Maltby pay huin-some money, but I cannot say the amount. I tImk there were two weddings that morning, but I believe there was only one funeraL No one was present but myself, Maltby, and Dr. Vaughan when the money was paid. I also saw Maltby hand the registrar's certificate, and I saw it in his hand, and I saw him make an entry in wh&t was called the rough book. (The book was put inL It contained an entry that the deeeaseed died at Acre-lane, and a fee of Os. was entered as havmig been received.) There were the iniitials "(G. E.' to the entr. They were the initia'is of Mr. Eastman, 6s. waRs a single fee f-or the ground, andlI think that portion of the entry was in Dr. V.aughan's handwriting. 1 am q,uite certain the words "¢Acre-lane" are in his handwriting. I don't remember when my attention was first calledto theentry after the occurrence.- I placed the undertaker's certificate upon the file. It was handed tome byD. Vaughanfor that purpose. The relatives have since paid me my funeral bill. By the ATrosusmc-GmAr-I was never regalarly appointed parish clerk, but I went on with the duties after the death of my father, who had formerly filled the office. Dr. Vaughan went abroad in Augast, 1855. - I don't recollect that be often complained of mv conduct. I was dismissed by hima on September 6, 185i5. My father was an undertaker, and I still carry on the business. I am not yet 18 years old. There was a good deal of excitement in the parish upon the subject of this matter, and handbills were circulated' reflecting on the character of Dr. Vaughan. (A handbill was produced.) I did not stick up this partibular one, but I did stick up others, and I stuck one up directly opposite the prisoner's house. I got the handbils from ir. Eastman, the curate. I do not know that Dr. Vaughan and his curate were not on good terms. I do not know what o'clock it was when 'I gave 'the money to Maltby, but a wedding was going on. Hie had nothing to dowith weddings. (A laugh.) He always came, however, toopen the church. I gave-him altogether 2X. 6s. 6d. It was before the wedding was over. Dr. Vaughnm officiated at the wedding. I will not swear that Itold Mlatby there would be a funeral on rhat day, but I think I did.. I cannot say positively whether I told him ornot. I sawMaltby pay the money to Dr. Vaughan, but I did not see the certmiicate lass Dr. Vaughan gave me the certificate afterwards, and put it on the file. Maltby- may have said something to the effeat of "out of the district," but I cannot say whether he did or did not. In answer to furthei questions the witness said he could not remember who spoke or what was said. The ArXoRNEY-GENxiAn (to the witness).-Will you swearupon your solemn oath that Maltby did not mention Acre-lane as the place whence the funeral had comae? Witness (hesitating).-I won't swear anything. Cross-examination, continued'-I looked in the rough book on the followig Sunday, and I then for the first time saw that the reside&ce was given as Acre-lane. The Doctor was inFruce at that time, and itwisafterthat I had heard that double fees had bedn improperly taken by Maltby, and that complaints had been made by some of the inihaiitants wpen the sabject. I thino I had seen the book'bothbefore and after the Icomplaints.

The next time Isaw the certificate, after I had given ittoiialtby, it was inDr.Vaughan'shand, and I saw him in the act of writing in the Tougs book, nud he then gave the certificate to me, and told me to put it on the file. The pew-opener was allowedlhalf-a-wronf for every out-district funeral, and Dr. Vaughan asked me if I had allowed thataum, andIsaidlhad; andhereplied, "That's By the ATro1N:y-GENsn1.-A portion of Acre-lane is in the St. Matthei's district. George Maltby said,-I was sextn of the district parish of St. Matthew's, Brixton. I was sexton for two years. I remember the funeral of Jane Webb. I donatknowexactly when Iheard first that the fhnerel was to take place. 1'l-nmer was the undertaker. I don't know the day of the month or week, but I remember the fauneraL ] I saw Pilumer at the church the same afternoon, about half-past 2 o'clock. I received something from him, but I cannot say whether it was on the day of the funeral or not. B[e certainly paid me* t. 15s. before the funeral tGok place for fees. They were double fees, I don%{i recollect whether he gave me anything else before the funeral took place. I. don't remember who gave me the certificate-whether it was the undertaker or ant one else. I think I paid the fees to Dr. Vaughan either the same day, or the day before, or the day after. Plummer was present whenh paid the money. I don't recollect seeing any certificate. 1. gave Dr. Vaughan l9s of that sum 12s. was a double ground fee, and the remainer vwas a double desk fee. I don't remember whether Dr. Vaughan made ay entry in the rough book. I- don't Temember whether there were any weddings on the day the funeral took place. By the ATTonRS,x-GEmiA.-It was in the morning wheu Ireceived the fees from Plummer. The witness was reminded that he had just before sworn positively that it was at half-past 2 o'clock in the afternoon; and he said that was wherL the funeral took place. He ther said he could not tell whether it was on the same davL at all that he seceived the money. The ArrosnXy-GENsu, told the witness to make his choice, and stick to something; and he then repeated that he could not tell whether the money was paid on the day of the funeral, the day before, or the day after. On further cross-examination the witness said that Mr. Eastman sometimes made the entry in the hooks, Lnd when the place of death was not on the certificate it was the erustom for the sexton to tell the naLme of the place to the clergyman, and he would of course put down what he *as told. He said that the Doctor was very frequently acconpanied by his son when he came to the vestry. Be conldnotray whether he had ever seen Dr. Vaughan bvhlmself six times during all the time he had known in. To the best of his knowledge, none of his children were present when these matters occurred ir the vestry. Mr. Joseph Vaughan frequently came with him to the church. He remembered two persons, named Hanison and Meynell rmaking a complaint one Sunday of having received an incorrect certificate, and they were in communication with Mr. Eastman, and they were asked to wait until after the service was over. While they were waiting he offered them the 6s. which they had overpaid. He did not oeactly offer them the money, but he hadl it in his ocket ready for them. They refused to take the mone. pe did net recollect tellin them to saty they had only paid 1. 9s. To the best of his recollection he did not say so. He wou ld not undertake-to swear he did not. He would not swear one way or the other. He went after the funeral of MIrs. Webb to lIr. MIatthew Vaughan, the son of the prisoner, hut he did not recollect saying T,O him that Eastman and PIliumer were trying to get up a row about the burial fees. He did not remember, but he could almost say he did not. Mr. Justice WIscnsLrN (to the witness).-Are you sure or not? Witness.-I cannot say. By the ATromNEY-GYarsuunA-The 6s. I offered to refund was half of the ground fee that had been paid by the parties. When the last abode is not upon the certificate he has no means of ascertaining the last abode, except by what I or the clerk tell him. The certificate on this occasion Idoes not contain the last abode. I don't know what I told the Doctor on this occasion. I don't know Ithat I told him anything. I was not there at the time. Plummer some.. times made entries in the rough book. The ATToRmix-GEsRAL told the witness to point out a single entry in Plummer's handwriting, and he was unable to dtO So. Cross-examination continued.-Ho had heard that Dr. Vaughan objected to Plurnmer going into the vestry at all, on account of his smelling so strongly of smoke. Dr. Vaughan had taken proceedings against him in the County Court. A distress was put into his house for M., and the Doctor advanced him the money. There was some dispute about 21. lOs, and there were cross-actions between him and Dr. Vaughan, and he obtained judgment in his favour, and witness's action was writhdrawn. ge swore be did not owe the 12., and his counsel withdrew from the case, and said he would have nothingmore to do with him. The County Court judge said he believed he had committed perjury, andhe should consider whether he ought not to commithim,andheafterwardssaidheshouldnotdo so because Dr. Vaughan was wealthy enough to prosecute him. He had bean examined a great mamy times in reference to these matters. The rough book was 2always open to the investigation of the churchwardens in the vestry. He never had a running account with Plummerfor fees except once, at Dr. Vaughan'stequest, for two orthree weeks. Generaly the fees were handed over to Plummer immediately. Re-examined-Mrn Harrison complained to the churchwardens that an incorrect certificate had been given to her, andthat she could not get some money from the bank, on account of the identity of the deceased person being disputed. He had received double fees himuself, but he only paid the Doctor singlc fees. He rePaid the double fees becausethe woman waspoor. Dr.-VaughaD toldhim to return the money. By the.Arrtos' -Gxers.ar.----The funeral of Harrison took place a day or two before Dr. Vaughan went to France. He should have g;iven the wom,lan the money if he had seen her. Dr. Vaughan iusisted upon his returning the money. Mr. G. Eastman said,-I was curate to Dr. Vaughan and stillhold the appointment. There were a good manyfnunerals at St. Matthew's Church at one period, when the cholera was prevalent. In June, 1855, I officiated as curate. The entry in the rough book of the funeral of Jane Webb is all in the handwriting of Dr. Vaughan, exceptthe initials "G. B." Sometimes the undertaker'scertificate was shown to nebeforelmadeanyentry inthebcok. Ithinklhave once or twice placed my initials to ablank entry, but I cannotsay whetherIdidsoon this occasion. Theentrymade in the parish register now produced is the same as- the one in the rough book, and it is also in Dr. Vaughan's hand'writing. By the ATron.NEY-GEntAL-I have frequently performed the burial service without seeing the registrar's certificate. Whenthe last abodeof the deceased was notmentioned in the certificate I cannot say how the particulars were obtained. The information is generally stated in the certificate. I have not taken an active part mn this matter, and am not aware that I have ever been on bad terms with Dr. Vaughan. I ordered some of the handbiUs to be distributed, at the churchwardens' request. I told Plummer where tostickthemup. Ididthis at the churchwardens' request. IbeleveIam stllth curateof Brixton. Ihave received notice from the new incumbent that mv services will be no longer required. The Aroiuxx-Gsmiir..---ave you given notice that before your departure you intendto preach one sermon upon the trial of Dr. Vaughan, and one upon-his conviction9 Witness.-I am surprised at the question. - ir. Serjeant Wuerss asked some guestions of- the witness relative to the certificates, and the rort-,=Gmm, sAL produced some, and made an observation respecting themi. Mr. Serjeant WMxM-s said theAttorney-General 'vas not a witness, and he must request that he would not give evidence. He had no doubt he would make a very good one, and, when he wanted him, he would subpcena him. (A laughL) The ATToiNY-GENMAL said he believed he should make as good a witness .Is some of those that had ben called by his learned friend. (Renewed laughter.) A number of the certficates were put in, and it appeared that some of them contained the last place of abode of the deceased persons and some did not. Mr. AX S. Prior said,-I am one of the churchwardens of St. Matthew's, Brixton. I was a inted by the incumbent. Inthecaseofthe urialof Mrs. WebbDr. Vunghan accounted tome for a singlefee only. He paid m3 6s. The handbills that have beenr produced were published b my sanction and that of -my brother churchwarden. I had nothing to do withthe pAblication of any handbill reflecting on the character of Dr. Vaughan. By the ATTroIn7r-GmiuaA-I saw only two of the handbis after they were stuck up. There has beena a et dealofexcitementin the parish upon this subject. lam avare that Dr. Vaughan disagreed with his curate, and T suggested that such a state of things was not creditable, and that they had better part. - Mfr. Edwards, the other churchwarden of St. Matthew's parish, gave similarevidence with relation to the handbills as that give by Mr. Prior. Mr. rior'was rcalled,and he said, in answer to questions putby the Attorney-General, that he 'as intimate wvith- Dr. Vaughan before these transactions, and he always -uderstood that he was a gentleman of competeut means to suppcort his station independent of the revenue he derived from his incumbency. - , - Mr. Serient Wiss said this was the case for tho' prosecution. The Aaro l~'GEI RU. then addressed thejury for the defence. H ]is learned friend had said that his cams wa5 concluded, and he could'only say it apreared to him to boe verY lhmentable case whenhe consiodred the naturce of the tEstimony upon which it depended. It was melancholy to see Dr. Vaughan, a -ergyman oftho Church of England,: a gentleman and a mno education, placed on-,hisa_tr for felony, and standingin the ignominious position -of a - prisoner at the bas of this Court5 -and he could not help thinking that but for the excitement about which 'they had heard the churchwardenswouldneverhaveput Dr.-Vaughan in such a position uponL testimony of the description-hat had been -laid- before, them. that day. There could be no doubt that a great deal of. excitement had prevaied-in the parish in referene to these proceedings, ad it appeared to eeq lyclearthat Dr. aughan.had not made himself onuLar ; and-.that eithes being a, man of warm tempner, from oeng too plain spoken, or from some- other cause, hc. hai unfortuna-tely gotinto hot water; anditwasiJnaxim-aman should.never forget tha ifhemadeenemies he' as sure ore day or other to--pay.he enty,:aud Dr. Vai An ws doing so on the present occason..

He plt it to the jury whether it. would not have been more fair to have gone int6 a case vhere Dr. Vaughan would have had am opportunity af pro. ducing couinter testimuony, and where the jury might ave hadtheopportunity of considering the degree of credfit to Whichthe witnesses on each sdae were entitled. in the casm now before the Court Dr. Vaughan was entirely at the mercy of the two men who were the trincipal witnesse against him. Notwithstanding this hiad beem done however he fet hat he was Tute safe, becanse he Lewta he was daealing with a tribunal that; would not decide upon the mere statements made by witmesss upon oath, but who would weigh allithe surrouding crcumstances and look carefly at the demeanour rid conduct of the witnesses before they came to-a decision. He entreated them to consider what the charge was that was made on the present occaEion. Dr. Vaughan, a man holding a high position as a clergyman, a man of property, was accused of taking the mLserable mmun of 6s., and, in order to do so, had placed himself certainly at the mercy of a parish clerk- and sexton, by wbhon at any moment he might have been detected. What was the amount that ws to be derived from the miserable and paltry pilfering? Why, at most it could not have anounted to more than a few pounds in the-coume of the year, and for such a paltry consideration the jury were askid to beheve that Dr. Vaughan had committed this miserable fraud. Was nGt the story told by the two witnesses Plummer and MlItby, upon whose testimony the charge entirely rested, in itself msoit iiprobibh1 ? They admitted that nothing wau said untill1irs. Biaison made the complaint about the incorrectness 6f the- egistbr, and it was clear that Miltby had the money himsel 'itAt she had improperlypaid. B -was of opinion tf- this was the key of the vrhoT ease. If Malthy would take one h.be would take another, andthe jury should:not forget thatili-aos in al state of pecuniary di~cuity,-that~ he had -had a distress in Eis house,-mnd it was for them to - consider wtlier it was not much more likely that he andFluinmer should. have taken these double fees improperly, by 'collusion ivith each other, than that a man m the position of Dr. Vaugban should have done- so. The sexton had clearly been detected in taldng the money improperly, and he wouldl have led the jury to blieverthat he offered to- eturn the money to Mrs Harrison, at the request of Dr. Vaughan, because she was poor. There was no evidence at all that she was poor; on the contrary, she made the complaint about the certificate because it was incorrect, and she was unable to obtain a legacy in consequence. Even if it had been -so, the jury were to belicve thatthe man who was represented to be so miserably sordid as to rob the churchwardens of this trifling su£n of money was willingto restoreittothose who werepoor. The Attorney-General then commented upon the conductoC the sexton, Maltby, and said it was perfectly clear that he wmas aware that a charge of perjury was han n over him, and he inewperfectlyvwell that if he could succeed in obtaining the conviction of Dr. Vaughan upon this charge he would have nothing nore to fear on that -score, and he had therefore a direct interest in endeavourin" to support the present prosecution. Be urged that it was nupossib eto lace any rehance upon the vidence of the witnesses 3altby and Plunamer; and he asked whether it was likely that Dr. Vaughan would have run the risk of sacrificin' his character, his position, and his family by placing himsif -in the power of persons of their description, who could at any moment have turned round upon him and destroyed him. W-ith regard to the alleged flise entry in the register of the residence of the deceased he urged that nothing was moreprobable than thatthe sexton BaltbyshouldhavementionedthenameofAcre-lane, andthat. Dr.Vwogban, having no s cspidon, placed that address in the register, and the4ury wou ear in nmindthat upon the certificate of the registrar that was handed to Dr. Vaughan the addresswas not given at all,butit wasmerely headed " Clapham district," and it turned out that part of Acre-lane was cwithin that disthict; so thatDr. Vaughan might very easly have been deceived. The Attorney-General concluded by expressing a confdent opinionthattheurywouldnevercome to the conclusdonthat a man in the position of Dr. Vau3ghan would h_ve perilled his aLl for such a mniserable gain, and that they would by their verdict express their opinion that there wausno foundation for the charge made against him. 3r. Justice WIGsoMAN then summed up. Be said that - the charge made against the prisoner wasthat he bad knowingly inserted an entry in the parish register representing that the deceased person, Anne Webb, had diedin Acrelane, when in point of fact she had died at CUlapham, and before the jury corld return a verdict of guilty they must be satisfied that the act was wilfuy done, knowing the statement to be false. The case appeared to him to rest entirely upon the evidence of the two witnesses Maltby andPlurmmer, and it was forthe jury to consider, after what they had seen of the demeanouar of those witnesses, and the manner in which they had given their evidence, whetherathey could feel themselves justifiedin returning a verdict of guilty upon such testimony. It appmeared to him that, even supposing they were speak;aug the truth in the matter, there was this difficulty in the case, that there wvas no p roof that Dr. Vaulghan knew that Acre-lane was a false address, and as it appeared that a part of Acre-lane was out of the district he would have been justified intaking double fees, supposing it to be a, genuine addres This was very important, because an essentialpt of the charge was that the false entries should be made knowingly, and if it were made otherwise it would be no offence. The learned judge then went over the whole of the evidence, and concluded by stating that it wans for the jury to say whether it was made out to their satisfaction. that Dr. Vaughan had made the entry in question knowing it to be false The jury immediately retuned a verdict of Yot Guty. There was some applause in the court when the verdicb was pronounced, which was, howvever, speedily cheC;ed. Sergea3nt Wnxxs expressed his intention of proceeding with th3eother indictments this (Saturday) msorning, andupon the application of the AT0ros.sy-GsexaL, Dr. vaughau was liberated in the meantime upon bail. -1EW COURT. (Before Mr. Judice WES.s.) Edmund Schell, 28, merchant; and Louis Schell, 26, merchant, two fashionable-looking Germans, were indicted for feloniously havingin their possession an engraved plate of a, promissory note of the State of Prussia, with intent tob defraud. Mr. W. J. Payne prosecuted, and hr. Party defended. Rudolph Appel, of 43, Gerrard-strect, Soho,. lithographer, stated thatiupon the 23d of last November the prisoners came to his house, and asked him if he could imitate a lO-thaler note, like one which Edmund produced. Witness said he would, if they gave him a proper authority, or he did not dare to do it. They said there was no haxn in so doing, and pressed upon him to do it, stating that a lithographer in the city had agreed to doitforthem. Witness after they had gone communicated to the PrussianAmbassador what had occurred, and he advised that witness should conEentto dowhat theprisonersrequired. Theycalledagain, and, after seeing some of witness's specimens, said they should want about 5,000 copies, and would give at the rate of 201. for 50 copies.

The total cost of the working stock, including 45,0891. expended during the half-year, amounts to 2,888,a526. The number of miles worked by the company is 8903, and the average cost of the working sbock 3,225?. per mile. The expenditure on capital account since the 31st of December, 1849, amounted to 4,168,275?., being at the rate of 69t712.. peranaun. The revenue account for the half-year ending the 31st of December last shows that the receipts amounted to 1,588,4591., and the working expenses to 609,9761., including 56,542L for rates and taxes and Government duty, leaving a profit on the working of 978,4831.

To the net balance of 633,5661. is added 6,950?., the balance from the last account, makmng the dis. pesable sum 640,516?. Out of this is proposed to be deducted 525,981?. for dividend at the rate of 53 per cent. per annum on the consolidated stock of the company; 10,310?. on the London and Birmingham 20?. shares, being at the rate of Ss. 6dL per share; 7,884?. on the Matnchester and Birmingham 10?. shares, being at the rate of 3s. per share; 10,9151. on the new 121. 10s. shares (21. l0s. caUed), being at the rate of Is. per share; 30,1641. on the Huddersileld and Manchester, Leeds and Dewsbury stock; and 6,7501. on the Coventry and Nuneaton stock, being at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum, absorbing together 592,004?., and leaving a balance for the next account of 48,5121. The ordinary dividend for the past half-year will be at the rate of 51 per cent. per annum, which,with the dividend of the preceding half-year, will maL-e the dividend for the year 1855 average 5 per cent. The Committee of Consmltation appointed at the general meeting of the company in August last, " to confer with the board on the general policy of the company, the rate of expenditure, and the best mode of increasing the present dividend to a more reasonable remuneration for the vast capital expended on the undertaking," have just issued their report. It states that the committee so appointed, consisting of 12 members, held, in the aggregate, 577,606?. of stock in the company, and that six of the members who have signed the report are holders of stock to the extent of 223,400?. With a view to show the extent and intricacy of the inquimrpon which the committee have been engaged they state t the capital of the company exceeds 3400,000?., the annual revenue 3,000,001. ;the number of servants in constant employment is about 13,009, the number of stations on the line is 354, the number of passengers carried annually is 9,500,000, the tons of merchandise carried annually is about 5,000,000, the number of trains run annually is 250,000, the number of miles run by the trains annually is 9,000,000, the number of railways with which traffic is interchangedis G1, thenumberofratesforgoodsinuseis470,000,and *forpassengerfaresabout250,000. Afteradvertingtothefinancial position of the company the report states that, while the fuxed securtes of the company rest upon a rock, the committee look with the greatest a pprehension upon the large augmentations of capital which have been, and still are an progress, and the time is come when afinal stand must be made. The shareholders may be assured that augmentation of capital means, generally, dimainution of dividends. This company, from the inherent wealth audgreat extent of its territory, has hitherto avoided the fatal policy of preferential issues; but if branches for protection and lines for political purposes, irrespective of their net receipts, must stil be entertained; if guarantees to other companies, on terms similar to many already sanctioned by act of Parliament, are still to be the order of the day; London and NTorth-Western stock will gradually drift to a permanent discount, and further issnes (if any such there be) must be on terms of preference to the new proprietors. It is, therefore, with much satisfaction that the committee find an entire concurrence, on the part ofth board, in these views; and they have to report not only a total absence of applications to Parliament for further branches and extensions, but that notices have been givento apply for powers to postpone the execution of some of the new works for which the company is responsible; and that the board has, during the last year, a ppointed a committee, whose special duty it is to watch and check the expenditure of any capital not previously and specially sanctioned by the proprietors. They have had before them very able statements on the cost and present earnings of branch and subsidiary lines. The general resudt is one of great pecuniary loss, compensated, to some extent, by the retention of much valuable traffic, and by the possession of districts which may hereafter become profitable; and by traffic brought upon the main line which, it is only fair to say, but for suchexcenditurewouldeitherhaveremainedundeveloped or would have been diverted by rivals to other channels, These extensions form, with thebattles of thegauges, abple. proof of the spiritprevalent attimerailwayswereinauTuated in Great Britain, and of the want of foresight, on the part of the Government and Parliament, in losing so great an opportunity of establishing the future highways of the empire on a rational and profitable footinm. There are, however, some redeeming features even in tMis picture of extensions; and the committee cannot quit this portion of the subject without expressing their satisfaction at the great advantages which the board have secured to the company by the early promotion of the Lancaster and Carlisle lilway, and, more recently, of the North London Railway ; and the purchase of the warehousesat Haydon-square; whereby this company has been placed in an impre position as regards the commerce of the city of London andthe Thames. By the North and South Western Junction, aggain, the lines of the South-Western, and other companies, hitherto separated, havebeen brought into unbroken counexionwith the London and Noith-Western system. They have also great reason to express the same ap roval of the course taken with respect to the coal trado of London. They think that a sufficient distinction has not been made between works of prmary and inferior importance; and that rates of expenditure which are justifiable, and, indeed, indispensable on the great highways, have been equally adopted by enginees on branches where the traffic is inconsiderable and the net receipts almost a blank It is in the establishment of duplcate lnes to places already adequately accommodated, and in the cost and results of contests, that the proprietos will find ample reasons for the diminution of their dividends. If Parlament, in place of encouraging the erroneous principle of competiton between railways, had allocated to each company a particular district, the necessity of agreements would not exist ; but the parties have had to test, too frequently by expensive strugles, their relative claims for traflic in dispute; and, after great loss to all, an arragement invariably takes place, and the traffic iS divided accordingly. It is thus that the practical spirit of the -age finds remedies for legisla. tvo errors, and companies do for. themselves by indi. rect and more cestry_m means w'h_at, -in-otZher` c'ountriues', the State - does for its subjects. Your commaittee have gone through the whole of the agreements with other com es ad have no hesitationi in stating to the =e2hoIders that so far as they are able tojudge,the interests of this company have been judiciously delt -with, and a great approach has been miadeo a good understanding with all the parties conc-erned on terms mutually advantagoous. The report then adverts to the arrangements with the Ilochdale canal, Stockport and Disley Railway, the INorth Staffordshire, the Great Northern, and the Great Western. They strongly recommrend the establishment of a good understanding with respect to the. traffic of existing companies, and, with a view to put a stop to the evils ariinag from competition and combination, they advocate the principle of P'arliament allocating differ ent districts to different companies, on certain terms and conditions, with a view to extend the railway system into new districts,which are atpresentdestituteofrailwaya&~m. medation, andto discontinuu theruinouspracticef prantinJg several lines of railway to accommodate the same district. They state thit the Parliamentary law and eagineerime.. penses of the comnpany, from June 1825, to June, M amounted to 1,6386518? of which 4,592. was chiapd. to revenue, and 1,384,W2 to capital, They complain that the passenger-tax presses with great severity on railways generally, and on some with great injustice. The amount paid by this company last year amounted to 48,5271. 'They also complain of the excessive amount of assessments upon railway property to the poor and other local taxes. These amount to about 58,2511. a-year on the London and North-Western Company. The law of compensation for accidents they state bears most unjustly against railway co7mpanies and requires amendment. With regard to the capital account the committee are satisfied that if it cannot be entirely closed, an approximation to closing it should be attempted. They propose to surround such expenditure with additional precautions, and that no additional expenditure should be sanctioned which does not pronise to bring adequato returns into, the exchequer of the company. The committee, in conclusion, state that, although some of the results of the past policy have been unprofitable, the committee are not insensible to the excessive competition and Parliamentary difficulties by which it has been surrounded, and have a firm conviction that the management of this great property has been marked by zeal and ability, and, abovo all, has been an honest management; and, further, that in spite of losses by unremunerative branches and the rivalry of formidableopponents, for the latter of which no board can 'e responsible, thecondition of the roperty is sound, and, when peaceful relations are established with other companies, capable, under a vigilant, energetic, and liberal adnistration, of early and great improvement." The report is signed by J. Parker, chairman; *J. Ryley, hon. secretary; James Pickup, James E. Marshall, George Hadfield, James Tgrer. GREAT WESTERN. The directors of this company have determined to recommend to the proprietors the declaration of a dividend for the half-year ending the Slst of December, 1855, at the rate of 2l per cent. per annum, carrying forward a balance to the current half-year of about 16,0001. SOUTH DEVON AND TAVISTOCK. A general meeting of this company was held at Plymouth on Monday. The Earl of Morley in the chair. The CILsRrILaN explained that the Royal assent was given to their act of incorporation on the 24th of July, 18I4. The compulsory powers for the purchlase of land would exire in July, 1857, and for the construction of works in July, 1859. At the time they obtained the IRoyal assent the subscribed share capital only amonuted to 116,0001. They would require to have 160,0001. subscribed before they could proceed to purchase the land. The state of the money-market had prevented them taking steps to raise the requisite amount. The share capital was increased in 1855 by a subscription of 11,0001. from the Duke of Bedford, and 5,0001. from other sources, naking it 132,0001. Various other sums had been subscribed in Plvmouth and Tavistor,k, completing-the capital to within about 8,0001. If they could not makeup the share capital, the undertaking mnst be abandoned. He hoped they would not allow the undertaking to fail for the sake of the small amount necessay to complete the subscription. There could be no doubt that the undertaking would be remunerative. After some observations from Mr. T. STEVE?iS, Mr. J. Buss,rLT, Mr. DABBn, and Mr. BuutmLr, Resolutions were passed, pledging the meeting to subscribe the requisite sum to complete the share capital of the company, and the proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the Chairman.

.THE SGAZLE IIN THE NOBTH. SHIELDS, flUMAY FonZiw&.- The eff'ects of the feaiful gale of yesterday morning are liely to prove verseiu to shippn in the Tyne. It W5-¶ at first comnputed tht 10,000?, would cover the damage done to the ships by being brought in collision dluring. the gale; but from 15,OOC1, to 20,000?. will be nearer the mnark. The storm -was* most fearful in Shields harbour, about 3 o'cloeck in the morning,, and the spectacle pe sented by ships breaking loose froni their moorings, and smiashing and crashing into each other, is described as awful beyond description. It was high water about 3 o'clock in the morning, when the gale was at its height, and the Tyne presented the appearance- of an inland sea rather than a commercia river. No small craft could live, and it was impossible to get steam tugs to assist the vessels that were doing so grat an amount of damage. The following are some of the casualties which have taken Slace :-Attwood, of Shoreham, -foremast carried away; Swedish schooner Fibra, upset, lying keel up, near the Hoyhill dock; Countess of WNestmorland, of Newcastle, lost nmainmast and safils; Ocean, of Colchester, lost one of her boats and stern stove in ; Sirius, of Shiedds sternd- edJohn White, of Whinstable, lost his boat;. WAIllam Shep pard, of Shields, lost rudder, sails, and a boy drowned the Evadne, of Shields, stem stove in, with other damage; Mary P2ig, of Shields, dismasted;. Penelope, of teondon, lest p art of her rigmgin; Gemini, of Shields, lost mizien top; Herues of Aldhborough, completely dismasted and a wreck ; Deolindo, of Guernsey, lost bowsprits and had bex topinasts carried away; Plremium, of Shields taffrhil gone and stem stove in; the brig Matilda both masts carried away and much damagedI in the hull; an apprentice, nLamed Henry Clarke, nearly killed, He belonged to the Good Intent, of Bnidport, and the accident was caused byV another vessel'smast falling over the Good Latent. Some1casualties happenedat Sunderland,but notanything so serious as onthe In the Lonig-reach a great amount of injury has been sustained by slipRing prop)erty. A numiber of ships broke from their moorings at J arrow-quay. A foreign schooner is capsized and sunk. A vessel, the Willialn Sheppard, has her topgailantcnast gone, and is otherwise much danmaed. Several ships have sustainedl injuries besides, and a large iron screw steamer, the Sylph, fitting out by Messrs. Palmer, of Jarrow, is reported to be much stove and damaged. A large floating dock drove across fromathe Coble Dean to the south side of Shields Harbour, and is sunk -with a brig called the Advance, on board of it. The Antelop brig lies athwvart the tiers at the New Quay in a very awk ward position, and some mischief has heen done to the fencing of the new floating battery building at Messrs. Palmers, The following vessels are upon the in-sand : the Rosebud, a Danish brig, the Carolinie and Henrietta, the James and Francis, the Sir Charles Napier, of Norway, the Amazon, the Royalist, a Dutch galliot, the Eyin Fish, and a foreign brig, and the Brinmas. A goodi deal of damage has been done in the country by the kite stormi, trees uprooted, stacks of hay and corn scattered about the roat and other miischief. The injury to property in the neighbourhood of Shields atnd Newcastle, and throughout the counties of Durham and Northi'mberiand is very extensive indeed, and the restoration of buildings and walls blown down will involve an epniueof some thouLsands of pounds. The list of csate svery extensive, but no life has been lost on land. The electric telegraph poles, that were Mlown down upon the North-Eastern. Railway, have been restored. Part of the spire of Tynemouth village church was blown down yesterday morning, and did some damage. La Scotland the effects of the storm appear to have been very disastrous. On the night between Wednesdlay and Thursday, Glasgow and neighbourhood, and the whole west of Scotland, were visited by a frightful hurricane. Heav rains fell at intervals during the day, accomnpanied by wl squalls, which, after nightfall, lengthened out into stormblst of the most potent character, and continued during the entire night with greater or less int,ensity. Fortunately, th,e loss of life and injury to the person miay be easily sunmued up; but the damage to, or the destruction of, property in the aggregate isverygreat. Lathei moring the citypre sented a desolate and battered aspect. Roofs were untiled, chimneys and chimney cans overturned in all directions andI the street-s strewn with the fragments, Throughout the suburbs the amount of damage is very grest. Alarge chimney stalk, situated between Brownstreet and College-street, was blown down, and has damaged miore or less five inhabitedliouses. In one of them.aakd was a severely injured in the leg that thxe limb had to ondergo imputation. A portion of the steeple of St. Matthew's Churcbhbad been blown down. A spirit cellar in course of beingg fitted up in Eldlerslie-street had its windows blown in and the intenor completely gutted. Mr. Steven's wrights': iop, Elliott-street, has been very miuch injured. A chinaniey stalk at Wilson's-mills, Old.Patrck-road, succumbed te the blast, and has damaged other adjacent buildings in the fall, Mr. Hill's workshop, Kent-road, has been blown down. The gable of a dwellinghouse in Lancefield was foreed over, but fortunately no person was hurt. La the eastern district a chimaney fell at 231, Mrain-street, Bridgeton, and at the samne time part of tie roof was driiven into the dwelling of Mrs. Hramilton, by which she was hilled on the spt and her daughter much hurt, A large new tenement, blonging to Mr. Aitkenhead, baker, Muslinstreet, Bridgeton, and situated in the Old Dahinarnock-road, -was blown down, It was four stories in lheight, and newly finished. The front chimaneys of the building at 102, Belgrove-street, fell in and carried part of the roof wit thiem, by which Mrs 'Napier and another womian were much hurt. The roof of the foundry in Ncr-street is dowsn, ho,lrany of the police watehmen -were hurt bythe falling ruins,bhut noneof them severely, The destruction of s lamps has been also very great, i'her hss also been very serious destruction to propert in the northern part of the city. A large recently erected stalk in the works of Messrs. Tennant, of St. Rollox, -was blowvn down, and falling upon valuable -works below has caused very serious loss. This was not the great stalk-, which is the highest in the kidngdom - but anywhiere else the chimney whiceh has thus fallen before the blast 'would be consideredl a mighty one, for it was nearly 35 feet in height, The exteniLve range of -workshops in the course of erection for the Caledonian Railway Comnpany, at St. Rtobso, have been disrupted in the most serious manner-presenting all t-he features of a mass of rains. These large erections were far towards completion, aud will prove a most serious loss to the contract-or, In the same district many of the monuments have been damaged and gravestones laid fiat in the Necropolis, and injury of a similar character has been sustainedl in Sighthill Cemetery. The hurricane was experienced in great fury in the vi'llage of Govan. A young woman named Jess-ie Muir, 25 years of age, wvhose father had diedl so recently as Satarday last, was in the house alone, and began to get ver frightened asthe storm grewvin intensity., ghe accordingl went into the house of a neighbour, but hadl only been there for a few nmiutes when the chimney fell through the roof tf the house, by wvhich she was deprived of e on te spot. La the southern part of the city the destmeutiou of po pet wa~s great, During the morning the roof of r Vixensa ironworks, Govan-bank, the roof of the boilerihed at Lily-bank-, and the reefs of several small building in the district were blown off. M1any casualties ocre on the south side of the riven. Two maagnificent building sheds, erected about three years ago by Messrs. Tocd and M'Gregor, iron shipbuildxers ad engners, at Particl4 were destroyed. These shcscn trceinf he imost sbstantial manner possible, were the most unique of their kidnd in the united kino-dom. They were in two divisions, the largest being about 34 feet'in length, 00 feet in breadth, aud 60 feet high; the second -wis 00 feet in height, 50 feet in breadth and 280 feet long. Thley were erected at great cost~ and while ships of the largest tonnage could be constructed with ease underneath their roof, the artisans employed were protected in comifort from the inclemiency of the we-ather, La a few minutes their destruction was comiplete. About half-past 1 o'cloc'k a tremendous blast from- the south-west caused them to yield, and they fell with a fearful crash, burying two vessels in course o constrction in the ruins. The inhabitants in va-rious parts of Partiek- heard the noise, and were under the impression that it was thunder, The immense timber supports of the sheds and the strong iron bars forming the -joisting of the roof wvere broken to pieces ; but this is not to be wondered at when we consider the height of the erections and the immense weight of the structure, there being about 150 tons weight of iron used in the construction of the roof, which was fitted with $,000 squaiue feet of corrugated glass. The whole weight of the structure was from 250 to 300 tons. The steamer constructing under the westernshied, and which was nearly ready for launching, is, we are happy to say, very little injured; the otheur, of lesser dimensions, the framework of -which was in process of erection, is very much damanged, but t'he exact extent cannot be ascertained. The damage which Messrs.Ted and M'Gre"or wil sustain by this disaster wil amount to between 15;066&Land 20,0001, The vilage of Partick also suffered-4om the effects of the storm. The dwelfings generally sufferedl more or less throu8h the destruction of chimneys, the tearing off of lead, breaking of glass, ke. At Whitemch the storm was not less severe,.L Mu3essr. Barclay and Curle's establishment the smithy and part of the engineers' shop were destroyed. The smithy in the premises lately occupied by Messrs Sandeman and M'Laurin was unroofed and the adjoining workshops otherwise in. . Teworkshosi the building-yard of Messrs. ~MWiiia Sinmons and Ca,w'ere also miore or less damaaed - and the stern portion of a ship which is being lengthen&id iA Messrs Thomias Wingate and Co.'s building-yard was blown off the blockcs on which it rested. Polkhw nisnihorodwr Mtteu force and fury of the storm. The streets oftlhe ton were next morning strewn with broken chimaney-cans andlslates. La some cases thatched houses were nearly unroofed, and in mnany of the more exposedplaces the slatca have also been more or less blown fromi the roofs. The river and frth at Bowlng were terribly agitated. Ships were driven from their moorings from the tail of the bank, and a large vessel was driven up the river by the gale, and cast ashore near Cardross-bay, where she lies on her beamends. The steamers which were moored or lying "'in ordinary," in Bowling-bay, were driven from their moorings. The steamer Wellington has sunk in the bay, and the steam-yacht of Mr. l1Iver, of Liverpool, remains in a similar position. The steamer Venus hasbeen stripped of her paddleboxes, and her paddlewheels have been carried away. The damage done at the Broomielaw is not of such a serions description. Three vessels broke from their moorings, and drifted up the river tiU intercepted by the Broonielawbridge. Fortunately, however, little destraction was done, At RenfrewFerrythe tiderose to such a height as to flood the lower fiats of several of the houses to the depth of between two and three feet- The gas was extinguished, and thq inhabitants of the houses reYerrj to were under the necessity of standing upon tables or sitting upon the cill of the windows, from half-past 1 o'clock till3, when the tide receded. As a matter of course, niuch valuable propertywas destroyed. About 8 o'clock on Wednesday night a fearful windrose, accompanied with rain. By 10 'clogck the gale was at its height at Paisley, and slates and chimney-cans wrere flying in alldirections. Intheconrseof the nihaubrftcsrr blown down, and a number of houses completely destroyed, the xovfa caried oft the widows smashed in aId made total wrecks. A largo number of thlatced houses at the west-end of the town were entirely 'enroofed. On Thursday mornng tho streets of Paisley presented a singular appearance-ald strewn over with chimney-cans, slates, tiles, rubbish of all kinds, aso a large quantity of thatch straw. A boat laden with charcoal at the quaywas turned over on her -side, and thewhole of the charcoal thrown into the water. Thc premises of Mr. Paul Campbell, bleacher and printer,Lonend, have also suffered very severely. A three-story house used for the printing business was completely desnobahed. On Wednesday evening Greenock was visited by the most violent tempest which has swept over it in the memory of those living. Slates, tiles, and chimney-cas literallyrained uponthe streets. Thepathway leading along the shore westward from the Bay of Quick has been much destroyed, and rendered impassablo at several isots. . A quantity of timber was floated awayfrom the Bay of Quick, and inthat vicinity several sheds were unroofed, and two brick walls levelled to the ground. Several of the boats which werelng on the beach were floated away, and a schooner on a neighbouring s5ip was self-launched, and has not been hear of since. Serious damage was suffered bytheshipping inthe harbour. Of the vessels lying in the roads, some went ashore in the neighbourhood of Helensburgh, others drove for some distance; and two large ships-the Mohawk and Stentorrode out the gale. So fiercely did it blow, and so heavywas the sea, that the latter vessew was pitching bowiprit under with 125 fathoms of chain on her port anclior. luring the night a schooner was discovered driving down athwart the Stentor's hawser, but her anchor caught the ship's, and brought her up. Of thefive or six vessels ashore, one is a Dutch brig, with rudder and roundhouse gone; another, a Sunderland brig, in the same condition;* and a third, the Emmapilotboatof Gourock, alsowith rudder carried away. The lighter Janet, of Greenockl, on her way down the river was drivern ashore and sank at Danglass, the crew escaping with their lives; while the lighter Helen, of Greenock, was driven on the top of the river embankment. A raft on its way up the river was broken up, and of the six who navigated it three were drowned. Two of the bodies were found on MIton Isle, near Dunglass, one of which wvs recognized to be that of a man named MDougall, residing isn Cartsdyke. Six or seven coasting vessels are lying on the Kilmun shore, having evidently put into Eoly Loch for shelter, and driven from their anchors. As many lie on the beach between Gourock and Irgs. All the seabathing places have suffered. Shore-street of Gourock was flooded, windows were driven in, and two side pinnacles of the U. P. Church thrown to the ground. At Lirgs several houses were unroofed, the quay damaged; the pier at Wemyss Bay was destroyed; and a portion of that at Dunoon carried away. At Helensburgh the loss of property has been very great {some of the residents estimating it as high as 100,000Z.), as it was exposed to the whole fury of the gale. The tide flooded the shops and houses in the street close to the beacLh, and it is rumoured that several people have been drowned. The storm was very violent at Ayr on Wednesday. A stiff breeze from the senth-west had been blowing during the afternoon, accompanied by heavy showers of rain and sleet, and towards evenng it began graduallyto gather strength, and continued so tll about 12 o'clock, when it increased to a perfect hurricane. Numbers of chinmneytops were hurled into the street, houses were partially or whollyunrocofed, garden pilings and walls were levelled to the ground, lamps were broken and lamnp-posts cast down, and even the firmest houses shaken to their foundations. In some laces the sea encroached 50yards. The new Free Church in course of erection in Wallacetown has been seriously damaged. The front gable, composed mostly of elaborate masonry, has been blown down, and one of the side walls has also been injured. The storm was bitterly experienced along the vale of Clyde. It appears to have been about its height from 12 till3 o'clock an the morning, after which it gradually died away. It was p receded on Wednesday evening by a very peculiar lurid-hlke aspect in the western heavens. i I
I THE METOPOLITAN BOABD OF TWORKS. Yesterday, at 12 o'clock, the Metropolitan Board of Works met again in the Council Chamber, Guidhall, for the transaction of business. Mr. Thwaites, the President, oc- cupid the chair. The minutes of the preceading meeting were read and confirmed. THE OARD AN-D THlE BANE OF LONDOyN. Mr. OFFon brought up the report of the committee on the security proposed to be given by the Bank of London, as treasurers and bankers of the board, and as to the most secure mode of drawing checks upon the bank. The commnittee stated that, in compliance -with the instractions of the Board, they had placed themselves in communication with the Bank of London upon the subject; that lMr. Scott, the secretary of the bank, had entered into various explanations vith respect to it, and they recommended that the Board should accept as security from the bank a bond of indemnity, under. their corporate seal, for securing and duly accouming for all moneys and securities belonging to the Board which might be intrusted to them as their treasurers and bankers, such bend to be in a form to be approved by the solcitor to the Board. The report also prescribed the mode of drawing checks upon the treasurer. Mr.TuisLER said, he could not concur with the committee as to the securityproposedto be taken from theBauk of London, for they had in substanee come to the conclusion that no security at all should be required from that bank. (Hear.) In the event of the bankruptcy of the bank, the Board would be able to prove the amount of its balance in the hands of the bank just as well without a bond as with one; in fact, the proposed bond would be just so much waste paper. (Hear, near.) He certainly understood when 1tlis subecb was referred to the comnmittee that what they had to consider was, how they might obtain a bon! jldc security for so large a sum as 50,000b, which would generally be deposited in their hands, and vhich might sometimes be larger. (Hear, hear. He contended that the only security which the Board would be jutified in accepting would be one based orn real pro- or money in the public funds. He believed that the bank had offered to deposit as a security the title deeds of property belonging to it of the value of 70,000l4, but on a condition which was wholly impracticable. If therefore the Bank of London made any difficulty about the security, let the Board wash their han of it (hear, hear); and the more so, as another bank was willing to act as their treasurer, and to give security on real property to the extent of 30,000M, unaccompanied by any impossible conditions. He moved that so much of the report as related to the question of security be referred back to the committee for reconsideration, and with the view to their stipulating for some better security. 'Major Lyox, in seconding the motion, said, he was propared to divide alone upon it if it was ouly to stand on their records as a protest against this proceeding. (Hear, hear.) The duty of the committee was to inquire anto the question of security, but they had reported upon that on which they were not required to report, seeing that they had reported in favour of taking no security whatever, for the bond offered by the bank was tantamount to none. Mr. BTupsur said, he must also record his protest against the report of the comuittee, considering, as he did, that the bond in question would e no security at all, and that in the event of the failure of the bank the Board would only be in the position of an ordinary ereditor. Mr. HAL5. apprehended that the bond wolrd take priority over al other proofs in the event of bankrptcy Mnr. TCmit said it would not. The subject underweent some further discussion, in which Mr. Heows, Mr. Few, Mr. Ware, and Mr. D'IffTanger took part, and Mi . Turner's motion for refermnu the subject to thecomitteefor reconsideration was eventually agreed to, with an addition, moved by MIr. Deputy Harrison and seconded by Mr. Savage, that it be an instruction to thee c e to require real seurity from t threasurer to the amount at least of oO,OOObe REPOBT OF TE FISAyE COM?nrE o Mr.tWoouycio, the Secretary, read thereport,of the hinance Committee, which stated that they had had uader consideration the claim of 4,493b 13s. 3d, made by ler. Edmund Smith, of Woolwich, contractor for works executed under the late Metropoltan Commission of Sewoers, in comnexion with the construction of the permanent outlet of the Victoria-street sewer, and also the recommendation of Mr. James Simpson, the engineer tuder whose Suenrintende,ice the works were executed. They had at the same time referred to the proceedings of the Court of Sewers on the 16th of October and 18th of December, 1855, when this claim was the subject of discussion ; a/nd they had come to the conclusion that MIr. Smith was neot entitled to a larger anam in respect to that claim than 843th ls. Sd. Since the meeting of the Board on the 1st inst., MWr. Smith had commenced an. action to recover the amount of his claim, and theyrecommended payment of the sum of 8343 Ils. od. into court. The commcittee had also examined the application for payment of wages made by James Frost afdl9 others employed under the late Commission of Sewers, as labourers and in other capacities, and they recommended that the applicants be apprized that, as they were not in the service of this Boardtheir claim would not be recognized. Thoy had dlso bad under consideration the claim of Lessrs. alke and Walker, solicitors to the Rock Life Assurance Company, for the sum of 181? 0s 10d., the amount of lawr charges incurred in connexion with an itended loan of 1 a0,0s00 from the Rock Oflice to the Sewoers Commission, which loan was eventually, by mutual4 consent, abandoned. They had referred to certain proceedings of the Court of Sewers inrelation to the same caim, and theyrecommended that Messrs. Lake and Walker be referred for payment of the amount in qaestion to their clients, the ?ock Lifeoffice, on whose roposition the agreement for the loan was abandoned. A lasth) The committee further reported that they had ex3mined the certificates for payment to the contractors of sums amountgn the whole to 1,09SL., and found them correctd and they recommended the payment of those sums. Mr. CREI,is moved that so much of tho report as referred to the application of the labourrg men, Frost and others, for wages, be recoasidered by the comnmittee t nr. SAVAGE explained that the committee, of which ho was a member, could not admit that the men in question weroein thesei dce of htheBoard, and that their application bad beenrefiised on that ground.th Mlfr. CreDlin's motion was pat and negatived, and the whole report approved.clelo b 1-EDMD A1ND SLAES OF SUEOEDInAtE OadtCERSt The SECsErs&A3Y read the further report of the committee on the salaries and dutles of officers, which recommended that eight clerks be employtd to assistthe Secretary to the Board in disehasging the du ies of his office-namely, fonr firstclass clerks, and a likeo number of second class derksa that the salary of th;e ffirst of the first-ls clerls bo350L; of the second, 300e; of the third, 250.; and of the fourth, 2004; amd that the salary on the first of the scond-class dlerls be 1201. -of the second, 100.; of the-third, 80DL; and ofthe fourdi, 70L . They also recommended that thtee clerkEs be einployed to assist the accountant of the Board-the first at a salary of 180?., the second of 1404., and the third iMr. DOULT70N, seconded by -Mr. BsRIST01VI, moved the postponement of theeconsideration of the report until the next board day, on the ground chiefly tha~t ibtC retation was not upon the ceWnd4 parer of the day, ana tbl 1 came before the Board.bvrsru_se. Mr. DepaSuy Haaruaoi objected to The motion, consider. iDg that it was absolutely incumbent upon them to' apposnt wthout delay a proper inumber of persons to assist the higher officers in carring on the necessary business oE thq Board The PRVSIDEis said, he was anxious that there should bo no unnecessary delay in the appointment of the staff of the Board. He felt cenfident that the Board would rise to a full appreciation of their position andtheir responsibility. They were called on to discharge most important functions, involvin the consideration and execution of great public works of the most formidable kind, and they must rise higher in their conception of the necessary stafffor carting out those works than if they were a parish vestry. (Hear, hear.) That staffougt to be of the most efficient kind, and to be fully organized, with the least possible delay. He himself required a superior officer to assist him in the onerous and manifold duties that devolveda upon him, and the clerk to the Board required similar assistaice. The Board would have atleast one public sitting in each week,and there would be besides three committee meetings, all which would givre rise to an amount of business which it would require a competent staff toporforn While ious that they should not have one single officer beyond what the service required he felt that nothing would damage the action of the Board more than the want of an efficent stal to carry out the requirements of the act under which the9 were incorporated. The discussion of this topic was continued bs Messrs D)alton, Atkins, Rows, D'Iffanger, Boysons,Xicholay, Irvie, Lowian Taylor, Offor, Davi6, and liall and the motion oE 3Mr. I)oulton was agreed to. OEYEA. PUlRPOSES COSIJLE. - Mr. WA~RE, pursuant to notice, moved the appointment of a commttee of 15 members to be called a "Gernera! Purposes CommLittee," to whor might be referred suchl matterseas s might not be distinctly embraced in the dutes of any committees appointed for special purposes. 3fr. Dounro opposed the motion, on the ground that they had already appointed commttees almost withous number, and that it was time enough to appoint such a comanttee when the necessity arose for it. By the appoint. ment of so many comnmittees they were forgm" chains around their necks, and if the evil went on, he should iko to know what business wouldremin for the Board to trans. act? (HHear, hear.) Mr. Ctoe L said, the Board had atpresentt 66miles of main sewters under its control, beides several contracts for other sewes, and nedoftheirfirst dunessbonldhave been to appoint a committee to superintend the working those sewers and contracts, at present almost wholly neglected. Hear,he r.) The Boardlsad lost a gooddeal ofntime in less debates; and ofte, on leaving the Board, he could not bu feel that one able man would do more'racical bstiness than the whole Board put together. Hefelt, howsever, that too serious an amount of work w.as imposed upon their chairman, in his bei required to attend themeetings of all committees of the Board, in addition to those of the Board itseli O HIear, hear.) He submittedat e chairman ought to be relieved from attendance on colmmittees, and so be at greater lioerty to discge the important functionss devolving upon himin his o cial The PRESnDwEs said, he was a working mar, and he felt ithis business and his duty to attend to very part of the working of the Board, and that he should be manmtng in his duty if he were not to do so. (Hear, hear.) Thr. wiEs l objected to the appointment of so mang committees, as having a tendency to break up the Board altogether, and as being nothing more than so many proofs of the paT feeling which exited among them. (Crnes of Onr. CORRIE rose to order, submitting that the hen; member should not be allowed to impute improper motives; to his colleagues. Mr. HAwVEES said, if they could not hear truth in one form he would put it in another, and say that the unfair system pursued in the nomination of comiittees was, in fact, diofranchisilg certain parishes in the metropolis in favonr of others. The motion was also opposedby Mlr. wiowmanTaylor, big Bristow e, and g . Bidgood, and negatived. FUI'URE HETlGS OPFH BOARD. OD the motion of 1mr. ailkison, it was resolved that the ordinary meetigs of the Board be held on Friday in each week, at 1.2 o'clock. TPE ThTERCEPJ3X SEWERGE: SCHEE 31r. OFFOPi, pursuant to notice, moved " That all the pls, sections, details, and other papers telative to the schemne of intercepting sewerage belonging to the Board be referred to a select committee to arrange and report on the same." Hle drewt, in a facetious speech, a contrast betweenL the present and former state of the Thamnes, and described the conditiondof Hackney-brook, which, frombeig a place in which he was accustomed to fish when a boy, was now an elongated cesspool, empt-yina citself into the river lea and then into the Thames, to both of which it gave additional contamination. He reminded the Board of the great public urgency there was for proceed';ngwvith the least possible delay to the consideration of the great scheme for intercepting the sewerage of the whole metropoLs which now fooud its outlet in the Thames, and carrying it to a destination where it would cease to pollute the river, and the limited time-five years-given them for the exection of tue work. The Board had now been five weeks in operation, and he thought it was high time tuat they got into harness and addressed themselves to the business for which they were incorporated. Major LYoi-, while agreeing with MEr. Offer as to the evil of procrastinating the work in question, differed from him as to the persons who ought to arrange the existing plans andemoved an amendment that it be referred to cerain engmeers, to'be hereafter appointed, to conaiderdend renort what plans would most effectually intercept the sewers dischargingmThemselves into the Thames within the limits of the metropolis, tan perfect the system of main dsain.-ge. Er. Deputy Hengsione said, thelateCon3mission of Sewers had coLlected from time to time about 200 different pLans forintercepting the existing sewerage of the metropolis, and their course of proceeding had beento refer those plans to a committee of their own body, who had devoted msch time and attention to the subject from first to last. But athourgh seven or eight years had been spent by them in collecting and considerig those different schemes, they had never come to a conclusion absolutely aotirming any parEticular one, and recommending it for adoption. The sESrtionu reminded the hon. member that the lnst and other Commissions of Sewers had reported on theK plan which they thought best. Mr. Deputy seRsaonc admitted that reports had hees moade of one palrticular plan, which appeared well calculated te carry outthe great interceptin scheme, aht beyond that the cmmissioners did nothing. He knew that some of the many eminent engineers whom the previous commicssonera had consulted oR the subject complamedthat it had never yet been referred tothem to say which was the best olan for carrig out the intercepting scheme. (Hear, hear.) They had said certain plans which had been submitted to them from time to time would doit, butcthey aio d atways said that with an evident reserve, as if they had some better plan in their mind, which no doubt they would have pro. pounded had they been asked to do 5o by any of the previous commissions. (Hear hear.) e submitted thatluothing would be more dep torable than to see this Board drifting into the adoptEon and execution of a great engineering work like this without its being submitted tc the consideration of the eminent engineers of this country, and if possible a pproved by all Or most of them. (Hear, hear.) ae would carefore recommend to the Board to refer this question entirely to certain engineers in whom the colutry had full confidence, t be hereafter appoted in conjrention with the engineer of the Boacd to reportto the Boardctheptln byswhich in their opiniongthis great pubc work would be most effectally andpeconomicallyecarried into execution. No time shoud be lost. Let the Board proceed at once to determine who those oentlemen shofud be, in order that they might enter on the consideration of the subject and come toaconclusion wh ch wonld command the respect and confidence of theBoard and the public. (Hear, hear.) fr. Douos submitted that their very exsstence as a Board dependedn he prompttude ith which they ptoE ceeded to grapple wvith the considertion of this great work, and urged them to proceed writh it at once. They had appointed an engineer at a salary of something like l,000t. a-year. He (Mfr. Dontton) wanted to know why it could not be left to that gentleman alone to propound a scheme for interCepting the sewerage without any extraneous as. sistance whatever? (Hear.) He submitted that it wouldbe bettor to swreep awiay all the existing plans, and commence de miore, leaving it to their own engineer to submit to the Board a plan for carrying out the w;ork in question. Mr. CARPirS suggested a middle course between the resolution and amendment-namely, that the Board, im. pressed with the necessity of at once proceeding with the intercepting scheme, request the chief engineer to report to them at the earliest possible peried on the plans necessary for cazrryig out the work. Some further discussion ensued, in which the President and Messrs. NiCOla,S Dixon, Bursiem, Wilkinson, Lyon, Harrison, Come, }tows, Hall, and Taylor took part. At length 1II. Offor withdrew his motion, and on a show of hands3fr. Carpmael's suggestion, which had assumed the formn of an amendment to the motion of Major Lyon, was carriedby a majority of 27. THEF 1ESFIC 01N LONDON- BRiGE. Mr. COrJuxSON gave notice that, at the next meeting of the Board, he would move that, taking into consideration the greatly increased and daily increasiing traffic over Lon. don-bridge and in Wellington-street and }Iigh-street, South. wark;, and that there is a sum of SO,000Z. arising from the coal dues, set apart formalcingimprovements in Southwark, it was most desirable that immediate and active measuresbe taken to provide for making a new line of street from eome part of t Higha-street, Southwark, towards the western part of the district.
