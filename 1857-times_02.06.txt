If the mines hAd yielded sufricient to pay the expense the order would hare been practicable, buet as the Cour made no provision for the oontrary state of things which actually occuzed the necessary ooulqteqneo was a large and con'stantly accumulatln debt, until it reached a point that further funds could niot be race even for the food and clothiog of the labourers, as may be seen by the attestation and affidavit of Dr. Guunnig the Chief CommIssioner. Mky cooBtnt appeals to Euglnd for ass. ants had been disregarded, and the bils draw by the Commissloner3 fQr current expenses, and already credited in their milrea ao. counste, were returned dighonoured lwas November yea, which ciaused the gudden stpace of the Cocacs Mines at=apontUo1 the deepest interest, and ata moment of almoet assured sce.Under the hard and cruel neoessity a voction, of the forc was hired out, and a part of the hire spliled to the payment of tho debts In the province. From
his fund te establisbMente Are now maintained, amd the machinery at Cbooes kept in repair; and will he s until the properties are sold, or tIe Coeses Aline seeed by the prpets undor the pleas of abandonsctent, in violation of the lease, What portion masy then remain itbis inct posible to say; hut IEde-clame meast slemnly, that even if tee exp(nFea were to he stopped immediately, the sumn In my hands would n6t amount to nec-fifthPast of my just-caims. Could thesefacts have been stated in court, I believe that tho judgment against mne (surely a haich and cruel one) would not have liceen given;- and I Indulge the hope that, as on a former occasion, an appealmay be succesfully made t3 a higher tribunal.
I undlerstand that my counel coDuld not he hmarc for twro reaonss

Yesterday Afternoon a meeting of the SuPporters of Mr. C. W. Martin was held at the London Coffieehouse, Mr. Francis Dashwood in the chair. Mr. Martin explained his political sentiments. He isaid that in
he sat in Parliament for the borough of Newpt, Isle of Wight, and became a supportermo Sir R. Peels policy both with respect to free trade and the repeal of the corn laws. He stll adbered to those pinciples, anld was willing to give his adhesion to the present Goverment eo long as they brought forward those reforms which were required. When he was in Parliament for Newport he gave his support to Sir W. Clay's motion on the church-rate question. He should still do so; and, with respect to the subject of the Jewish disabilities as this country considered all under its laws to be free, he oanould give his Toto fOr the removal of themi. Mr. Martin then condemned the incometax, and gave oinion that the Government wdiild abandon the addition ald.ini theapound. In answer to a question from an elector Mr. Martin said he was opposed to the ballot. Aresolution in supportofMr. Martin, secondedby Mr. Wells, thP., was unandiously agreed to.

THE LATE BRIGADIER STOPFORD.-As the several
THIE LATE BiuGADem STOPFOP.D.-As the several published accounts of this truly gallant officer, who fell at the storming of Bushire, are in almost every instance incorrect, we submit the following outline of his achievements, which we believe to be correct:-The late distinguished officer was James, third son of the Rev. William Stopford (Rector of Garrycloyne and Grenah, county of Cork, randnephew of the second Earl of Courtown) and Abigail Evans, third daughter of Eyre Evans, of Miltown Castle, county of Cork, cousin of the second Lord Carberry. He was not a graduate of Dublin CoUege, but studied for the army, along with a younger brother, at the Hanoverian University of Gottingen, by the direction of his Royal Highness the Duke of York, when placed on his list as candidates for commissions by the late Lieutenant-General the Hon. Sir Edward Stopford. Brigadier Stopford was appointed Ensign of the 40th Regiment while studying at Gottingen. He was sent out when a young ensign to join the 40th in Australia, in charge of a convict ship, and on the voyage he showed his first instauce of cool bravery. He was parading his guard on the quarter-deck when the convicts rushed on deck, having mutinied, asnd taken advantage of the endeavour to save the doctor, who hadthrown himself overboard; Ensign St9opford had barely time to form his men and fire on the mutineers, many of whom were killed and wounded, before they were forced below. From Australia he accompanied his regiment to India, where he contirnued with it, except 'while on leave of absence, until its arrival at home under Lieutenant-Colonsl Stopford's command. He accompanied the 40th as junior major up to the Bolan Pass, in the Candahar campaign; was at the taking of Khelat-i-Ghilzle and Cabul and, having traversed India, returned through the Khyber Pass to BengaL He commanded the 40th at Maharapore where, in attacktng and taking the enemy's guns the 40th lost as many offic~ers and mien comparatively as tZey did at Waterloo. Here,'asthedespa6tch said,,-"MajorStopfordfelI leading on his regiiient, dangerously wounded, at the very muzzle of the enemy's guns." For this service he was made Lieutenant-Colonel and Companion of the Order of the Bath. le ly fora considerable time wounded on the field among the dying ard the dead, mnen and horses, and might have faUeen a victim to his own generosity in feeliDg for others, as ha did through life, tnore than for himself. When his " dooly" or stretcher was sent for him from the rear, and he perceived General Churchill lying near him mortally wounded, with both legs earried away by a canon ball, he said, "Oh I General, you are worse than I am, you'll bleed to death,
must go on this dooly.2 When Colonel Stopford was at las carried tothe rear he arrived just in time to say farewell to the Gencral, who died immediately after. Another anecdote at Maharaipore saould be related. Colonel Stopford's horge lay kiking beside him in the agonies of death, and he called several limes to soldiers who were loading as they passed "o .put fie horse out of pain," and one man fired and only broke the horse's jaw. Colonel Stopford was often heard to say tha4 notbing affected him so much as the increased ago4y -of his favourite charger. Well may his regiment have been "fAarious at the loss of their Colonel," for a bulcet ever plerced a better or a braver heart.-Du&in JfaI.

Viscount DUNGA2NNON gave notice of his intention to ask the Postmaster-General whether any arrangement had been come to by the Government relative to the steampacket communication between Holyhead and Kingatown, vhat was the nature of such arrangement, and when it was likely to be carried into effect.
TICKETS OF LEAVE.
Viscount DUNGANNON also gave notice that on Mon. day he should ask the noble earl the President ot the Council whether Her Majesty's Government proposed making any alteration in the systemn of tickets of leave to convicts, and whether a return to the system of transportation to any of our distant or rising colonies was contemplated.
ANSWER TO THE ADDRESS.
Earl SPENCER, Lord Steward of the Household, brought up the Queen's answer to the Address of their Lordships' House, in reply to Her Majesty's gracioui Speech.
OUR DIPLOMATIC REL&TIONS WITH PERSIA.
The Earl of ALBEMARLE gave notice that on Monday, the 16th inst., he would move for an account of the gain total of the expenses incurred in diplomatic nissions to the Court of Persia by the Governor-General of India from 1799 to 1814 inclusive, comprehending salaries, establishments, military escorts, transports, and presents; slso, an aecount of the sum total of expenses incurred by Her Majesty's Government and by the East India Company on account of the British legation at the Court of Persia for establishments, house-rent, and pensions, for the last year for which the same could be furnished. He should not move for these returns with any wish to anticipate the discussion respectng the conduct of Her Majesty's Govemment in advising tho Crown to declare war against Persia, but rather to raise the question as to what should be the future policy cf this country towards that State; whether a semi-barbarous nation, such as it was, should be placed on the same footing as the civilized nations of Europe, remembering that Persi* vas not in community with European nations, that it did not necessarily possess any political connexion with this country, and that it had no possessions conterminous with those of Great Britain. With a view, therefore, of raising. this question, he should, on a futureoccasion, move thatthe diplomatic relations between this country and Persia, which were now suspended, should not be renewed.
THE WARS WITH CHINA AND PERSIA.
The Earl of ELLENBOROUG.-I wish to ask the noble earl the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he ean lay on the table of the house any deposition madeby Thomas Kennedy, who is stated to have been the master of the lorcha seized by the Chinese authorities at Canton, and to have been on board at the time of that seizure? I beg further to ask whether the noble earl can lay on the table any despatch, if such exists, from Her Majesty's Government at home to Sir John Bowring, authorizing him to take the opportunity, i2 any favourable opportunity arose, to urge upon the authorities of Canton the neceesity of observing the treat.7 entered into between the two countries under which Englishmen were to be admitted into Canton?
The Earl of CLARENDON.-The deposition of 'ihomas Kennedy is included in the papers which I laid upon the table the night before last. I have made inquiry, and I believe, if there has been any delay in the production of those papers, it is in consequence of its having been thought desirable to have a map of the river of Canton, which will give a complete view of all the operations there. That map has been furnished, and I believe that in the course of this evening the papers will [be produced. With respect to the other question put to me by the noble earl, no specific instructioe has been given to Sir John Bowring by Her Majesty's Government in respect to the admission of Englishmen to Canton; but in those general instructions with which he was funished when he left this country he was told to bear in mind the desirability of obtaining free access to the cities named in the treaty, and more particularly to Canton. When Sir John Bowring arrived at his post he communicated his arrival to the Imperial Commissioner, and requested an interview with him in Canton. 'lhat interview, however, was refused, and the only despatch addressed to Sir John Bowring upon that subject was one in which the Government approved the measures he had taken upon that occasion. No instructions have been sent to him since, although Sir John Bowring has constantly represented the inconvenience resulting from a want of direct communication with the Chinese authorities.
The Earl of ELLENBO ROUGH.-Is it the intention of the noble lord to make any motion on the subject?
The Earl of CLAEENDON.-At present it is not my intention to do so.
The Earl of DERBY.-Is it likely thatthe papes respecting the war with Persia wii be placed in our hands in the course of next week?
The Earl of CLARENDGON.-It was my intention to lay them or. the table in the course of a very few days. Tbe only reason why I should not wish to specify any particular time for doing so (although they are quite ready) has refer. ence to the negotiations which are likely to be entered into with the Persian Government through its representative at Paris.
The Earl of DERBY.-I must say I think that the reason given by the noble earl hardly appears sudicient for any delay in the production of these papers. We don't ask for any documents affecting the negotiations, but we do ask for papers illustrative of the motives which led the Governmentto enter into the war, and of the manner in which that war was proclaimed. On this point, I confess I was much struck with the very powerful statement made on Tuesday evening by the noble earl opposite (Earl Grey), and although I could not give him myvote upon the amendment then moved by him to the Address, yet in the general principles which he laid down I am disposed to concur. T certainly do not think the mode in which this war with Persia was commenced and proclaimed was consistent with constitutional practice and us-e,.
The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH-Will the noble earl opposite lay upon the table any papers ilustrative of the measures, whatever they may have been, which were taken by the Government of India upon their receiving information that the Persians were moving hostilely upon Hlerat ?
The Earl of CLARENDON.-I cannot answer that question at present.
The Earl of MALMESBURY.-A very different poiicy appeas now to be followed with respect to China from that which was acted upon by preceding Governments. If Iremember rightly, when Ifiled the office of Foreign Seer. tary, and while Sir John Bowring was in China during Sir George Bonham's leave of absence, Sir John urged Her Majesty's Government to insist upon the performance cf that particular part of the treaty which gave us a right to enter Canton. Now, nobody doubted our right on this point, but there was a difference of opinion as to the advisability of insisting on it; and, if I remember rightly, Sir George Bonham, a most prudent and experienced man, was of opinion that it would be of no benefit, but rather the reverse, to insist upon our right, and that trad, could be carried on quite as well, and perhaps better, at the factories without the English entering Canton, which would only expose them to insult from that barbarous and prejudiced po pulation, and would be likely to lead to difficulties between the two countries. I hope, therefore, that my noble friend (the Earl of Clarendon) will give us, among the papers which he is about to lay before your lordships, some of the despatches sent hopme in 1852 and 1853 on the point I have referred to, particularly if there are any in which Sir George Bonham, whose advice is worth listening to on such a question, expressed his belief that it would be inexpedient to press for an entry to Canton. Such despatches will serve as antidotes to those of Sir John Bowring, who recommended a course exactly the reverse of this.
The Earl of CLARENDON.-I have not the least objection to furnish the papers which my noble friend has indicated. In reference to the allusion made by him to Dr Bowing's conduct at the time Sir George Bonham was in England, I think, if I remember rightly, that my noble friend in his despatch-I read it in The Times-did not give any decided opinion on the subject, but instructed Dr
owring to confLne himnself strictly to the maintenance of
the dtus quo. M y noble friend's instructions were to tle effect that Dr. Bowring should not meddle with anything. ("Hear, hear" from Lord Malmesbury.)
Earl GREY, in expressing his satisfaction that his noble friend was willing to lay the papers referred to by the noble earl before their lordships, hoped that they would extend as far back as the original treaty, for, as their lordships were aware, the controversy was by no means a new one. He begged especially to hope that among them would be included a despatoh which he had himself written, with the concurrence of and after consultation with the late Duke of Wellington, dated N ovember the 24th, 1847
which strictlyprohibited offeusive operations being under. taken by the local authorities without reference to the Government at home. (Ear, hear.)
The subject then dropped.
LORI) CARDIGAN ALND MAJOR
CAITRORPE.
The Earl of CARDIGAN.-I am anxious, my lords, to a,.ke,advantage of the earliest opportunity during the pro. sen ', session toput a question to the noble lord the Sacretary fo r .r connected with a subject which, although, I regret- t say Jit, nearly concoerna Myself, still is one w ahich is, I believe, connected with the general inter est of the .army. The question which I am about to pit relates to ihfifmatfon of charater b o fk hl'
commissions in the army. Before putting this question allow me to remind your lordshios that of late years circura.
tinces are entirely chauged with regard to the means which a man has to defend his character by the change of opinion vhich has taken place with regard to the laws of honour. Your lordships will remember that the great Dako of Wel. hngton, when on a great political question he considered himself unjuastly reflected upon, had reconrse to the remedy provided by the laws of honour, and a smilar conrse was adopted by Pitt, bY Fox. by Canning, by Lord Castle. reagb, by the late Sir IL Peel, and indeed by nearly all th3 great and distingnisbed men of the past and present century. I, my lords, have been more unfortunate than they were because, in following their example, I have been placed at your lordships' bar to be tried as a felon, and have stool in danger of losing not only my personal property, bat even mypersonalliberty. The law regarding duelliog has gradually become more stringent, and since the event occurred which put me to so much inoonvenience only one personal conflict has, I believe, taken place between two gentlemen, and upon that occasion one of thoso gentlemen lost his commission and was imprisoned for two years. The Mutiny Act also, and the Articles of War, have also been altered, and are now msuch more stringent and severe, and it is upon the Articles of War that I will found the nuestion which I wish to put to the noble lord, and, in obedience to the Articles of War, I ask the protection of the highest military authority. The facts are these :-My character has been maligned, nd my military reputation defaaed in a most extraordinary and most uncaUed for manner by an officer holding a commission in the army. That offlcer has publshed his unfounded statement under the cognomen of a Staff Office-, but he in reality is Major the Ron. Somerset Calthorpe, a near connexion of a memberof your lordship? House. First of all, my lords, it may be necessary for me to say that, with the exception of one statement with regarl to a certain number of horsef, all the rest of his allegations contain enot one single vestige of truth, and are entirely and utterly devoid of foundation. In the difficult position, my lords, in which I was placed by the publication of Major Calthorpo's book, the course which I thought proper to adopt was the followingAlmost immediately after the appearance of that book I applied to the Commrander-in-Chief, and requested him to bring Major Calthorpe before a genbral court-martial for conduct unbecoming an officer and & gentleman in disgracefully maugning my character. Hts Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge refused to accode to my request on the ground that such a course would be productive of incon venience to the general interests of the army. The next stop which I took was to request a friend of mine, xn officer who had attended me upon several occasions in the different services in which I was engaged by Lord Eaglan!s orders with the cavalry-he and his brother staff officers never having heard of anv foundation for these gross fabrications -to go to Major Calthorpe and point out to him how unfounded his Statements were, and to calmly request him to reconsider the subject, and o wvith draw those mnisrepresentations in ny manner he might think proper The answer which that officer received was an dmission that two out of three of those allegations were totally and entirely devoid of truth, and the others were explained by Major Calthorpe in so flippant and offensive a manner as to be entirely unsatisfactory tome; and he refused to withdraw those statements from his work on the plea of inconvenience to himself and his publisher. I am aware, my lords, that mw7 people, pernaps the majority of people, may say, " Why need you care about it; why take any notice of it 1" But, my lords, I think that when a man's character is openly attacked he is bound to defend himself in some way or another. lad I been attacked generally, and in the manner in which a gallant admiral has been attacked, I don't think that I should have taken anv notice of it, because I s,hould have considered such attackcs ridiculous and absurd; but when an officer comes forward and states that on certain specific occasions I did things which it would have bedn discrbeitable in me to do, and bringscharges which, to use the words of a galtant lieutenant-general, are preposterous, I do not think that it is for me t allow the matter to pass If it were merely a question of the present, these allegations might have been passed over on account of the insignificance of the officer by whom they have been brought forwgard- but, published in a book, they become, if uncontradictea, matter of history; and I, my lords, do not wish posterity to form an opinion on my conduct upon inatenals vwhich vonld lead to a judgment most unfair and unjust. The qusition which I wish to put to the noble lord is thiswhether, after having received a letter from Lord Raglan thankinn me for the manner in which I conducted the reconnaissance in the Dobradscha, and for the information which I obtained, which letter I have in my possessionwhether, when afterwards my name was mentioned in the despatch written after the Battle of the Alma in a manner which must have been most satisfactory to my own feelings in connexion with the affair of cavalry on the preceding day-whenI rS fortunate enough to boone of those general officers who had the distinguished honour of receiving the thanks of your lordBhips' House-after all this, is it right or proper that a junior offioer holding a staff appointment should be permitted, two years afterwards, with impunity to malign my professional character ?
aszk, whether an officer who hasthas disfraced hlmself, by publishing EtatementCOntaining allegations so gros and so utterly devoid of a*vestige of truth, should be allowed longer to draw even half-pay from the public purse, and whether he should be permitted to continue to hold an hiononrable post upon the staff of the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland ?
Lord PANMURE-Owing to the general terms of the notice which was given by the noble earl who has just sat down I was unable to do more than to guess at the nature of the question which hevas about to put to me; and I must be permitted, now that I have heard it, to express my regret at the practice which is growing up of making either House of Parliament a court of appeal upon points of discipline respecting the administration of the army. (Hear, hear.) I cannot, however, find fault with the noble earl for avaiing himself of hid privilege as a peer of Parlia ment to refute in this public manner the accusations which I cannot bht say have been most wantonly bromght against his military character; bat I think that while he was conscious of being in possession of the approval Of Lord Raglan for his distinguished and gallant conduct in the Crimea, he might well have afforded to pass by in silence the remarks of one so inferior in rank and judgment to the gallant officer under whom the noble earl served. More especially might he have done so, I think, when he considered that he was armed also with a document which showed that he had received the thanl;s of this and the other House of Parliament.. (Hear, hear.) Although the noble earl charges a particular officer with being the writer of the book to which he has referred, let me remind him that, as far as the authorities at the Horse Guards are acquainted with the facts, that book was written under an anonymous signature. The Commander-in-Chief (who would have been present in his place to-day had he not been in attendance on Her Majesty), upon receiving an application from the noble earl to redress through the means of a court-martial the injury which he had sastained from that book, stated that he did not conceive that it was his province to take notice of anonymous miitary publications, because such a precedent once established would lead to inevitable confusion in the administration of the discipline of the army; and that moreover it appesred to him, as it appears to me, that the noble earl had a recourse open to him by an appeal to the civil courtLs of the country, whereby he might have obtained reparation for the defamation of his character. The noblo earl has stated the reasons why he did not adopt another course in vindication of his honour and why he did not appeal to what he called the "law of honour. My lords, think that he was perfectly zight in making no such appeal, and Iam sure that the sooner such a law is abrogated entirely the better it will be for the profession and for society at large. (Hear, hear.) I think, under all the circumstances, that the only answer I can give the noble earl is to say that it is not the intention of the Commander-in-Chief to bring the officer who is supposed to be the author of the work in question to a court-martial; and I would strongly recommend the noble earl to rest upon the high testimonials which be has in his possession to refute the injustice to which he has been subjected. (Hear, hear.)
hTHE NEW FOREST.
The Earl of MAMESBUJRY, in moving for certain returns relative to the New Forest Hampshire, of which he hadgivennotice, ask-ed the iadlgence of the House for trespassing uon their time with a matter which was so far personal to lamelf that he might be said to be one of these who were to some extent upon their trial before the Commissioners of the New Forest. The noble earl then narrated the circumstances connectedwith the appointment and the prGceedings of thecommission. e said that in 1851 an act was passed for the purpose of putting an end to the deer, which contained a clause enabling the Crown to appropriate and plant 10,000 acres, in addition to
the b,tJW acres already possessed by it in the New Forest; the commoners also were called upon by that act to prove their rights before the County Court judgeat Southampton, nd power was given to sell waste lands to the extent of 2,000 to defray the expenses of cag out the act. That sum was found to be far too sm for the purpose, and in 1854 another act was passed appointing tree Darristers to adjudge on the claims of the commoners, and giving them power to sell any quantity of waste land in the forest, in addition to the 2,0001. ssnctioned by the act of 185i in order to defray the expenses. These commissioners had been engaged ever since November, 1854, and he begged to remind their lordships that many of the commoners were very poor persons, who had no original title, but who had a right of user of uiwards of two centuries, and who felt this investigation to be of the very greatest importance, regardin it almotas a strugghle between the Sovereign and themselves It was of the hig est importance that the commissioners should proceed with the adjudication as rapidly as possible, becausethewitnesseswere neegryvggan ol o be expected to live much eincendiary fire which took place in the New Forest a few years ago originated in the feeling which prevailed among tho people against the commission; and he had no hesitation in saying that the commissioners could not evince toO great a
spirit of conciliation. Sach a gpirit had net been displayed. Theppulation affected by the commissioners covered abo0ut IOW t.ares, and the plAces at which the commssijsoners held
their sittings were at so great a distance from the
resideneeg of the parties vhose. claims they were. called upon to decide that in many instances the poorer commoners could not afford to pay the exp2nse of convaying-theliewitnesset- Onl the oter dy sera parties were obligel P$ attend th conimissi on es at a di-
tance of from 10 to 20 miles from their residences. Again,
t was matter of complaint that the commissioners had sat only two years, and that during the first tbey had succeedel ia dispoSiDng of no more than half-a-dozen claims, while during the second, 1856, they bad confined their sittings t' 40 days. IHe had been told by an ingenious lawyer, and h3 had every reason to believe the statement to be true, that every sitting of the commissioners cost four acs of the forest. In November last, hearing that a court waI to be held at Christchurob, and finding that his claims and those of his neighbours were not to be taken at that sitting, he ventured to address a communication to the commissioners, against whom he enter: tained no sort of prejudice; explaining his views on the subject. That letter was wvorde in what he believed to be a proper manner; but, in order that their Lordships migh3 judge for themselves, he would htke the liberty of reading is:-
"Gentlmeu,-aving "Heron-court, Dec. 1T', 1355.
cc Gentlernen,-Having lately returned from abroad I have only just learnt from Mr. Druit, atChristchurch, that you are about to hold A Court upon Purest CLaims at that placo; but that mine, although my property is actually adjoining, are not to ba investigated, but are deferred to a more distant period and locality. I therefore beg leave to ask yosu upon whiat grounds my interests are treated differently from the majority of cases belonging to this parcah? If it ba so, I am exposed to a great increase of expense in sending my witnesses (necessarily extremely aged persons) a long day's journey, instead of a short walk to the court, wrhile the poorer claimant', whose witnesses .ould be nearly the same as nine and those of the hrge proprietors, are deprived of the advantage of saving their :xpensesaltopether by calling them simultaneously with ours. As I consider It a case of great and *pparently useless injustice and inconvenience to myself and others, I have taken the liberty to press upon you my view of it, in the hope that you may think fit to take the whole of this parish at the same time and place.
'-I remain, gentlemen, your obedient servant.
"IfgALhtESBURY. "The Hon. the Comminsioners for Forest Cisms/'
On the 1st of January-c fortnight after the date of his communication-he received tSi following answer -
" Christchurch, Jan. 1.
"My Lord,-I have laidyour Lordship's letter before the New Forest Commissioners on the first occasion of their meeting since the receipt of it. I am directed by the cammissioners to acknowledge it, and to inform your Lordship that they cannot take any notice of the questions and argaments therein contained, as they do not recognize in any man the right to address them in the manner your Lordship has thought fitto assume.
"The usual public notce will be given of the time and place at which the commissioners will hear and determine on your daim.
"I am your Lordship's veryobedient servant,
"1W. StRIAD
"Clerk to the Commissoners. " To the Right Eon. the Earl of Malmesbury."
(Hear, hear.) When he received that letter, signed by the clerk to the commissioners, he thought it was the ebu ition of some trancing attorney, not conceiving it posdible, having no intention of offiending the commiPssioners, that they had authorized the transmission of sO discourteous a communication. But he had since ascertained that the commissioners themselves, and not their clerk, sere responsible for it. He rejoined in the following terms:-
"H eron-court, Jan. 3 " Sir,-I beg to acknowledge your note of the ist inst.
" Having been in the habit of corresponding officially with every class of public servants, both abroad and at home, and having myself had the honour to hold a high responsible an,cointmcnt under the Crown, it would be troly unpardonable wero I to deserve thecharge of ahowinZ a want of courtesy and respect to persons delegated by Her Majesty for any particular service.
" With this feeling in my mind I hxve carefully read the copy of my letter of the 17th of December to the New Forest Commissioners, without being able to discover the unintentional offence which, as you state, 'the manner I have thought fit to assume' has caused I could have had no motive in offering such to the public position of them gentlemen, and still less to them personally, because I am at this moment unacquainted evenL with their names.
" Had I found in my letter any expression which could be construed into'a solecism in private or officiad correspondence I would gladly offer them an apology. As it is, I cannot do so; but, on the contrary, munst alirm that, in applying for an explanation of certain orders which appeared to subject myse and my poorer neighbours to unnecessy and therefore unfair expense, and in ' taking the liberty to press upon the commisdoners my views, in the ho pe hat they might think fl,' &c*, I was exercising the undoubted privilege of self-defence and supportig itin tbe largen'e of a gentleman. I knew tbat we had no appeal from the 3'udicial decisions of the Court, but I believed that wve might without presumption observe upon its preparatory acts, and, like other defendasts in other courts, plead for speedy justice or a ehange of tvnue.
"But, as the commissioners ' do not recognize in any man this right,' it only remains to me to ask in Parliament for a public explanation of the course of justice to which I (as a party concerned) object, and, if possible, also to ascertain in what more fitting form of diction than that which I have used the New Eorest Commissioners expe:t to ba addressed by Her MEajesty's subjects.
"I remain your obedient servant,
"MALMESBURY. "The Clerk to tbo Commissioners for the
New Forest Claims."
(Hear, hear.) If be had received from the commissioners a letter of explanation, which, however, he did not say they were bound to give ; if they had simply stated, in official language, that they could not comply with his request, he should not have troubled their fordships with the subject; but he had read the correspondence to chow the animus of the commissioners and the absence of that delicacy of management which, desirable in all cases, was especially required in a commission necemsarily offensive to the people. After the correspondence had taken plAce, a memorial was addressed to the commissioners by the mlistrates and gentlemen residing in his neighbourhood, which had the effect (so we understood the noble earl) of causing the commissioners to announce their intention of holding their meeting in March at Christchurch, instead of at Southampton. The following was an extract from a letter which he received from the oldest magistrato who attended the meeting where that memorial was agreed to:-
" Dear Lord Malmesbury,-We did not ask you to sign our memorial, feeling that after the treatment you had experienced you onght not to be exposed to the chance of a repetition of it."
What he wished to impress upon the Government wsv the cruelty of compelling persons to wait a long period for the settlement of their cases, imposing upon them the risk of losing their witnesses through advanced ago, and also the necessity of modifying some of the terms which had been laid down by the commissioners. There was one point to which he hoped the attention of the Government would be direeted. When the deer were in the forest they were protected bya cUlass of men called fencemen. In the act of Parliament these men werealtogether ignored by the Crown. and now that there were no fawns and no deer in the forest the employment of the fencemen was insisted on. Before ponclding he would refer to the case of Brecknmok Forest, which was enclosed some years go. They began with selling one-fifth of the forest, and at the end of seven years the lawyer's biUl had sweled to so large an extent that it required tho sale of two-fifths of the land to liquidate it. 'What became of the other two-fifths he supposed no one kner. (A. laugh.) With that precedent before them he thought they conld not act with too much caution. He asLed the noble earl opposite whether the Government approved the letter which the commissioners wrote to him in answer to the one he had sent them. The noble earl then moved for returns of the number of days and of hours each day on which the New Forest Commissioners had sat forthe purpose of adjudicating the commoners' claims, since theact of 184 passed; the number of claims already settled at the present date, and the numberstill remnaining on the lists; the am nt of expenses incured to this date by the commission, payable out of the future sale of the New Forest waste.
Earl GRANVILLE had on former occasions been warnei of the extreme difficulties which he would have to encountsr in answering in an efficient way questions relating to those departments of tho Government not represented in that house, and the discussion now raised had afforded some proof of the wisdom of that warning. He was happy, however, to say that the responsibility did not in this particular case rest on hrn as a Minister of the Crown, for the commission whose conduct had been impugned was responsible, and that to Parliament alone, having been constituted by an act of Parliament. The noble lord at the head of theGovernment, like thenoble earl, was a commoner in the New Forest, and a defendant in this very suit ; but there was this difterence between thom, tbat, while the noble earl complained of the delay wbich had taken place? the noble viscount was not very well pleased that his claim had been so speedily disposed of. and that in a manner not at all satisfactory to himEelf. (Heir, heir.) Having received from the noble earl opposits timely notice of hismintention to move for these returns ke had written to the commissioners on the subject, and they had sent to him copies of a statement which they bad transmitted to the noble and learned lord on the woolsack, not in his capacity of adviser to tho Crown, but as the head of the profession to which they belonged. He would, therefore, ask permission to leave the matter in the hands of his nob!e and learned friend.
The LORD CHANCEJLLOR said, it was quite true tha'
e? papers refered to by his noble friend had been put into bis 'and, ad he woui therefore make a few observations on the subject, especially as on one or two points the noble earl (AIamesbury) had a little misunderstood the position of the commisoners. Th e act of Patliament passed in 18-54
appointed the judge of the County Court of the district to be the head of the commission, and authorized the Lord Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench to select two other barristors to constitute the commission, which was to be a court for the purpose of hearing claims and adjudicating upon 'them. The gentlemen selected were Mlr. Barstow and Ar. Coleridge, and it was due to them to cay that two more honourable men did not exist. They proceeded to the district and entered upon the duty of hearing the claims of the commoners. The noble earl seomed to suppose that a rule was laid down which required persons to prove their title from 1800. That was a mistake. All
they did was to satisfy themselves that the commoners had acquired a legal right to their land. The act f Parliament said that if any one could prove that he bad.' been in possession since 1800 it was to be hld sufeident; but such cases were exceptional, and in most instances they had been Fatisfied with proo of 20 years' possession. In the discharge of their duties the commissioners bad to fix times and places to hear claims. This was a legitimate exerdse of the powers confefred upon them, *nd they had stated tohim
that they were anxious to havo the,mannerin which this
duty was dischrged examined and sifted 'in the'-nstsearching manner. No persons could be more desirous than' they were to conclude their daties. They had no interest,
in point of remouneration, in delayig'tho adjudication of' the claims, because, as he understood, the. ale ef the forest lands was to pay the. expesse of the commission.
e ha4 told the commissioners that he thought they had uiponatruea he lette r of thQioble earl alogethen rT {Elet,-

their extreme regret thaLt they should have so mnisundersto 4t
it, (Hear.) But what they felt Was that they were thera,. mot so mrtch a commissioers of the Crwton coatest wWt-t the cormmoners, as pernons who were appointed to do lin
partisl justice to aU partits. When the Pnoble lDora' letteresmotobland the u etion wAs under considera-loa whetherthey should sit at Zheritchurch or some other plwce, and in eonformity with tbo oath they had taken. tbeY felt thatitewere bound to decide this and every question jitdic ally an. in accordance with the interests of the comm'oers
While this matter was under consideration the commi - dioners received from the noble earl a letter, ia which it was stated that the course they were pursuing would beattendeda 'with injustice."
The Earl of 31ALUESBURY.-With "apparent in. justice.
Tho LORD CHANCELLOR.-Well, if the expressiom ha-I been "injustice" he did notthinkitwould have justified. the reply of the commissioners. Indeed, in his o inio
there was nothing in the noble earl's letter that called for an angry answer. He believed that the commissioners had. discharged their duties with the utmost zeal, and if there. was any ground for complaint it was not that their prooeedings had teen too slow, hut that they had been too hasty. He could only say, on the part of the coimisesioners, that, thc returns which had been moved for wouid be repareth
with the utmost care, aLnd that they were anxious that their proceedings should be subjected to the most strict invest W gation. He would venture to say that the character ait conduct of the commissioners vere unamsailable, and tbatn they had enideavoured to discharge their duties in a satisfac.- tory manner. At the time they received the noble ea:.l
letter they were considering whether it would be for the interest of the suitors that they should sit at Christchurch. or not, and as theythought it would be advautageous to th:, suitors they determined to sit at that place.
Lord CAMPBELL took some interest in the conduet o! these commissioners, because, although he would gladlr have been spared tke duty of mnaking the choice he had: been caUed upon by Parliament to appoint tya,f -them. There were three commissioners, one of whom-a County, Court judge-was named in the act of Parliame., «d i
selecting theother two commissioners ho had acted upon tboe maxim, ddur dignior4 and had appointed llessrs. B3rstow and Coleridge, members of the Western Circuit, and he believed that it would be impossible to find in the legal profesEion two gentlemen who were more likely to discharge their duties in an exemplary manner. He thought the reply of tho commissoners was hasty, and was to be regretted, for there was nothing in the tone of the noble earl's letter todisentitle him to a courteous answer. The commissioners. doubtless looked upon the noble earl's letter as an interference outhe rt of a'utor wththedischarge of their fone-. tions; buthe (Lord Campbell) thou ht there was no groun
for Fach an opinion. He belieted thatwhen the returns forwhich the noblo earl had moved were produced it woutld be found 'that the commissioners had ducharged their duty ably, industnorisly, and with perfect fairness. He thought the noble earl had somewhat prematurely censured the commissioners in the letter he had addressed to T2e Timesnewspaper, and that he ought first to have moved for the returns and havo reserved his censare until he found that it;. was justified bythe facts.
The Earl of HARDWICKE considered that his nob' v friend (Lord Malmesbory) had rendered a public service bybringing this subject under their lordships' attention, for he,thought the conduct of the commissioners ought to be carefully watched by Parliament. He believed there was noe; tribunal which vas so satisfactory to the commissioners and, so unsatisfactory to landowners as an enclosure commission,. for he had known cases where commissioners luxuriated in. turtleand cham3gnie, and discharged their public duties in. the most leisurely manner. The Lord Chancellor ha tsaid thosecommissioners had been too hasty in their decisions,. and he (Lord Hardwicke) thought they could not have paid very diligent attention to their duties, as they had only sot
for 40 days since their appointment. The letter of the, commissioners to his noble friend was corched in suchterms as he had never seen addressed by public officers to, any gentleman in tbe land, and he had certainly expecteedL that the noble and learned lord on the woolsack-although he said he had no power to censure the commissionerswould have expressed his strong disa probation of the can-
duct of members of the bar who ha'obeen parties to sucha.. communication.
The Earl of MALUSBURY wished to say that he did. not complain that the judicial decisions of the commissioners had been unfair, or even mistaken. He complained of their arrangements, which he thought were most objectionable. Be had been under the mark in stating that the commissioners had only sat four -homs -day atChrist-- church, for, taking the average, of a fortnight they had only sat threo hours and a-half a- ay.
The LORD CHANCELLOR said, it was clear that the. act of Parliament had not contem plited a continuous sitting,
for it had appointed the County Cout judge of the district'one of the commissioners, and he was always emp!oyed. several days in each month.
The returns were then ordered.
TICKETS OF LEAVE.
Lord BERNERS, in moving for a return of the number of tickets of leave issued to convicts in each year since tho commencement of that practice, their original sentencav and unexpired time, showing the number of such convicts reapprehended, for what ofence, and the result of such. proceedings, said he was aware that great misunderstanding had gone forth on this subject, but, considering the strong condemnations of the sytem of giving tickets of leave tohardened felons and men who made crime their profession.
which had proceeded from the learned judges, from thepolice magistrates, from the recorders of vaious boroughs,. and from nurerous grand juries and quarter se3sions, itwas right that their lordships and the public should be putin possession of clear and detailed information, not only asto the number of tickets of leave granted, but of the c6aracter of the persons to whom they were granted, and the-
ality of the offences for whith they had been committed. rOm a return lately laid on the table he found that, although the number of offenders committed for trial during the year 1855 was smaller than in previous years, the more serions crimes were on theinerease. Taking the five yea-sending 185, manslaughter had inesed 21 per cent., bur-s. glaries 21 per cent., laroenies from dwelling-houses 30 per
cent., larcenies from theperson 12 per cent., and forgery 20per cent.
Earl GRANVILLE said there would bo no objection on the part of the Government to grant the return. e did not think it advisabla to enter now into this importtnt
question, fornotice had been given in the otherHouse of theintention of the Government to bringuin a bill on the subject of secondary punishments, when the Secretary of State fc - the Home Department would state at length the views of tl e Government.
The Earl of CARNARVON suggested that tho retutn moved for by the noble lord should not be confined merely to those holders of tickets of leave who had been re-onvicted for some 'fie offence, but should be made als to, include, in an dgoitonal column, those ticket-of-leave men. who had been reapprehended without the commission of anrdistinct crime. Their lordships were aware that the tickets, of leave were granted upon certain conditions, and that t'sey were revocable not simply on the repetition of ac's of violence, but also at the pleasue of the Home Secxtary, provided that Minister was satisfied that tbo. holder was leading a suspicious life. Thoobjectof ths latter proviEion obviously was to prevent the men from r;turning to their old associates and to habits of idleness; and, were it wise or were it inexpedient in itself, there was little doubt that it was an important feature of the system.
In order, therefore, fairly to test the working of the e itiresystem, it was desirable to ascertain how many of the minhad been reapprehended under the category just meotioned, as well as under the other categories enumerated in the proposed return.
Lord CA&iPBELt, while agreeing that this was not a favourable opportunity for entertaining the subject of secondary punishments, yet believed it to bo most importanb; that their lordships should know at the earliest possible moment what was the real question they had to consider in the present emergency. That question was not whether they should or should not continuo the issue of tickets of leave, bat whether they should or should not return to the. practice of transportation.' The granting of tickets of leave was not a snbstantive, but merely a collateral measure, contingent upon the suspension of transportation, and while the system of transportation continued in abeyance theevil now so loudly complained of must go on. The Govern-- ment must take into their serious consideration the absolute. necessity of returning to transportation, if security was tocbe extended to Her Majest7's peaceable subjects; and nothing but the assurance given bv the noble carl that a
measure onthis subject wasin contemplation, and about tobe, introduced into the other House, could at all quiet the alarmn now so justly felt by the public. Had it not been for that promiso on the part of the Govemment, he should have deemed
ie his duty immediately to bring the question under theirlordships' notice.
Viscount DUNGANN`ON regarded it as of the utmost. importance that these returns should be laid on the table.
Crinme as rapidly on the increase, and in the rural districtsoffences were fast multiplying Which until lately were, scarcely ever heard of. The result was the general a'a-m now prevaleut'throughout the community. It was impossible for the man who was sent back to the scene of h s former offences to obtain employment there, and cons -
quently he must either return to his previous practices ( r remain in a state of absolute starvation. This was exposing him to a d.gree of temptation beyond what human natuA-
could be expeeted to bear; --a&nd-n-o wonder, therefore, if' ho should relapse into evil courses. While in Irelandduring the recess he (Viscount Dangannon) had visited tbe convict establishment at Spike Island, ant obtained information as to the operation of the ticket-of-leave system in that country. When a man's conduct had been such as to entitle him to a ticket of leave, before he received itinquiries were made by the police authorities as towhether or not he could procure employment, and also as to tho character and habits of any person offering to take him into his service. If the' result of those inquiries was satisfactory the convict obtained his ticket of leave. That appeared to be a verY cautious and admirable mode of proeeding, and would, at; all events, be a decided improvement on the plan pursued in England. But be that as it might, what had oc3mrred during three5ss had unfortunately excited apprehensions. in the public mind that wero only too well founded; and it
was earneslly to bo hoped that the session would not beallowed to pass without a thorough revision of the existin;;system and the adoption of an effectual remedy for the' a arming spread of crime.
Earl GRAN1qrIIE was understood t~assent to the' niedification of the return recommaended the noble earL (Carnavon). - '
The motion was then agreed to, and their lordships ad.- joursned at 7 o'clock,

MIr. ROUINDELL PALMER presented a petition from one Charles Attwood, a farm-labourer in Essex, who stated that he was 60 years of age, with a wife and 11 children; -that he had rented a cottage for 30 years ; and that he had 4drought up his large family without the aid of parochial
reli e. Frrom Christmas, 1855, until August last, he worked for the same master, but under no written agreement, and {his wages were paid weekly on Fridays. Be had a dis pute with his master at the end of a week when he was receiving his wages, and he left his service in consequence and went into that of another. The employer whom he left thereupon had him taken on a charge of leaving his 'work before a magistrate, who condemned him to 21 days'
-bard labour in Chelmsford Gaol. He Eerved the full term of his imp__sonment wore the prison dress, partook of -the pr andperformed the hard labour. On returning hromne he was taken ill, and the consequence was that he lost the benefit he would otherwise have had of working at the harvest. But that was not all. In December last the
titioner's son, who was employed as a serv-nt to the Rev. Mr Hemming, came up to London one Sunday, and being too late for the last train, which would have conveyed him 'home, was afraid to return afterwards, and had remained in london ever since, because his master had obtained from a neighboumnn, m gisrate a warrant for his apprehension for I- avinn his service. The petitioner complained that the laws which allowved such proceedings were harsh and unequal, -and he prayed that it might be amended, and that such -arbitrary power might no longer be vested in a single magistrate.

Mr. LAYARD gave notice that to-morrow (this day) ha 'would ask the noble lord at the head of the Government -whether Fernk Khan, the Persian A mbassador in Paris, was now n.cgotiathig with Lord Co.vley under the authority of the same powers which he possessed when at Consstantinople; and also when it was the intention of Her Majesty's Government to place upon the table of the house the papers *relating to the Persian war.
MINISTERS' MONEY.
Mr. FAGAN, by Mr. HADFrELD, gave notice of his in. tention upon the l9th inst. to ask for leave to introduce a bil to abolish the tax called ministers' money in Ireland.
MAYNOOTH.

SECONDARY PUNISHBMENTS.
Mr. MILNhS gave notice of his intention, upon the 3motion for the appointment of a select committee to con'aider the system of secondary punishments, to move as an amendment that the select committee which sat last year upon the subject of transportation be reappointed, and ir. structions given to it to inquire into and reportupon the best ;means of procuring temporary employment for discharged -prisoners.
COURT OF CHANCERY (IRELAND).
lr. MACARTNEY inquired of the Attorney-General for Ireland whether hle was prepared to bring in a bill in accordance with the report of the select committee of the House of Commons for improving and altering the busin&-s -of the Court of Chancery in Ireland?
Mr. J. D. FITZGERALD reminded the House that a -committee which sat last year to consider the subject of the Cout of Chancery in Ireland had reported 22 resolutions, based upon which three bills were introduced into Parliament -and pssed into law. Bythose acts the condition of the Court -of Chancery had been materiaUy changed, a new Judge of Appeals had been created, and the Court had to a great -extent legislative power to work out its own reforms. The Encumbered Estates Court had been continued until July, 18;8, by which time Parliament vwould be prepared to con. sider the condition both of that Court and of the Court of -Chancery. It wvas therefore not the intention of the -Government to introduce this session any bill relating to the 'Court of Chancery.
WEIGHTS AND MEASURES IN IRELAND.
Mr. RUME inquired whether the Governmesit had it in -contemplation this session to introduce a bill to assimilate the weights and measures throughout the various counties and market towns of Ireland.
Ir. HORSMAN replied that a measure upon the sabject 'was in preparation.
ENGLISH CAPTIVES IN FORMOSA.
MIajor SIBTHORP inquired of the First Lord of the 'Treasury whether Her hlajesty's Government intended to take any measures for the release of the British seamen shipwrecked on the coast of Formosa, and now in captivity -on that island.
Sir G. GREY said, orders bad been sent out to Sir J. Bowring to communicate with the adnsirnl on the station, and to desire him to ascertain whether the report was true that British subjects were held in captivity in the Island -of Formosa, and, if ao, to adopt the best means for obtainloag their release.
POOR LAW MEDICAL RELIEF.
]Mr. RICE asked the President of the Poor Law Board 'whether it was his intention to propose during the present session any measure on the subject of medical relief.
Ar. BOUVERIE replied in the negative.
THE SALE OF POISONS.
Mr. BRADY inquired whether it was the intention of Her Majesty's Government to introduce any measure this session for the better regulation of the sale of poisonous drugs.
Sir G. GREY replied that he did intend to introduce a measure upon that subject, and he hoped to do so at an early yperiod, (Hear.)
THE VACANT JUDGESHIP.
lr. GLADSTONE wished to know whether it was in'tended to fill up the vacancy in the Court of Exchequer caused by the lamented death of Baron Alderson, or whether it was intended to keep open that vacancy until the comnission recently appointed to inquire into the state of the judicial establiqhments in Westminster-hal had made their report?
Sir G. GREY believed it was not intended to keep open the vacancy on the bench of the Court of Exchequer during the prosecution of the inquiries of the commission. The in3tructions of that commission wero to inquire whether any changes could he made consistently with economy and 'the public convenience, whereby a reduction in the number
of Judges could be made. A t the present time he (Sir G. Grey) wvas informed that to keep open the vacancy caused 'by the death of Baron Alderson would cause great public inconreniensce.
THEB HIUDSON'S BAY COMPANY.
Mr. LABOUCHERE, in moving for a selecb committee, -aid it was his duty to state the reasons why Her Majesty's 'Government thought it incumbent on them at this particular time to call attention to the state of those vast pos. 4aessions of the British Crown which lay beyond the limits of the two Canadas. Thoee extensive regions, although for the most part comPrising a country little fitted for the ia-dustriai pursuits of man, except so far as those pursuits
*ould be exercied in the chase of animals which s-applied fur, or ij,isheries, neverthelems contained large districts ad. nirablaited to the use and enjoyment of civilized mansome being rich in soil and minerals, and others from situ%. tion, being extremely valuable to commerce. Ihe believed indeed, that he should be able to prove that in this subject were involved questions of imperial policy, justice, and humanity of noordinary magnitude. (Rear.) The authority over thoseregions was for a long timne divided between -the Hudsou's Bay and the North-Western Companies, whose collisions produced injury to trade and gave rise to sceneS of bloodshed and confusion; but not long ago that authority was vested by amialgamation in the Hudson's Bay Company. 4nd, in point of fact, that company possessed exclusive trade within, and almost exclusive administration over, all the immense tracts of country which stretched from the watets
of Hudson's Bay to the waters of the Paoific, biclngyan . cove'isl and It would be necessry that he should stet, tbough very briefly, the nature of the tenures under which the Hudson's Bay Company exercised such vast powers. In the farst place, by anciett an charter, granted to them by COarles II. in 1670, they possessed, or at least they claimed to possess, rights of the most important description over all tbat portion of British North America which was within Rupert's Land, and was descrieed As lying on the borders of the rivers flowiing into Hudson's Bay. Some years ago An address was carried asking the Crown to investigate the claim of the company to thi* charter. Lord Grey, who was then Colonial hinister, baving obtained from the company a statement of their claim, referred it to Sir John Jervis ind Sir John Romilly, who were the law advisers of the Crown. The company in their claim, after defining Rupert's Land, stated that under the grant they had always exercised and enjoyed exclusive right of trade in those territories. The law officers of the Crown gave it as their opinion that, without doubt, the rights so claimed by the company properly belonged to them; but they suggested that it would be more satisfactory to the company themselves if their rights were made the subject of decision by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. As, however, that proceeding involved considerable expense, the persons opposmg the company declined to carry the matter further, and he was therefore justified in saying that, although frequently controverted, the
rights of the company under the charter had been long ea. joyed, never disproved, and, as far as inquiry- had boen made, confirmed. Under a Royal license, granted about 19 years ago, for 21 years the company also possessed the right of prosecuting the fur trade over a far more valuable and important country than Rupert's Land-namely, the district to the west of the Rocky lountains1 which was called British Oregon, and extended to the Pacific. The license expired in1859, and a few weeks ago he receivedfrom the directors of the Hudson's Bay Company a letter stating that they wished to know whether the Government intended to renew their license. He thought it the peculiar duty of the House of Commons to decide upon such a question, and that the Government ought not to pledge themselves without giving the House full opportunity to consider it. Although the license did not expire until 1859, the nature of the trade (requiriDg long preparations) was such as to make it most unfair to the company to postpone the decision as to whether there should be any change or not until the last moment. He rephed to the directors that he should feel it his duty to bring the whole subiect of their affairs before a committee of the Houqe in the present session, and in justice to the company he was bound to say they expressed not only perfect willingness but an anxious desire to have those affairs thoroughly investigated. He hoped the committee would take a large and statesmanlike view of the whole question, looking to the considerations of polcy and humanity which were connected with it, and he was satisfied they would receive from the Hudsones Bay Company the frankest and fullest assistance in the prosecuion of their inquiry. He had stated the tenures by which the company held Rupert's Land aud the vast territory betweenthe Rocky Mountainsand the Pacific. They also held Vancouver's Island upon a tenure differing from both of the other two, as the House would probably recollect, because the circumstarces attending the transaction were a good deal disessed at the time. Lord Grey, the then Secretary of State.for the Colonies, thought the best arrangement was to grant a lease of the Island of Vancouver to the Hudson's Bay Company for 11 years, terminable by giving a year's notice, but necessarily ternminable in 1859. It was obviously the duty of the Government to consider seriously the condition of that island before the lease was renewed. He thought it would therefore be expedient to alppoint a committee to consider the condition of Rupert's LAnd and the charter rights of the company; to consider the condition of the territories west of the Rocky mountains, over which the company held an exclusive license to trade until 1859; and also to consider what policy it was right to pursue with regard to the renewal ornon-renewal of the lease under which the company heldVancouver'sIsland. The terms of his motion were general, because any narrow view of this question would be snostimperfect and fallacious. Looking to the condition of the Indian tribes that inhabited the vast district in question, there were considerations of humanity which the House could not neglect, and he trustedthat competent and experienced members of the House would not refuse to give this subject their attention as members of the select committee. He did not think it necessary to state, except in-the most general way, the mode in which the Hudson's Bay Company managed their affairs. The company had at its head gentlemen of the highest character and sagacty residing in London. They employed an agency of 1,200 persons, who were scattered over a gSeat district of c Tmtry. They were almost en-
tirely Scothmen, and conducted the affairs intrusted to them with the skill and shrewdness that might be expected from them. Hle felt bound to say that the company were not neglectful of their duty as trustees, which in some sense they were, for t'ne British Government and people, and also for the Indian population with which they were connected. As far as his information went, their rule had been beneficial to the native population. There might have been, and, indeed, must have been, occasional scenes and actions extremely to be regretted and deplored; but, on the whole, the principal members of the company had acted in a considerate and humane spirit to the native tribes who inhabited their territory. The companys agents were narrowly watched, their promotion depended on their good conduct, and a degree of discipline that any Colonial-office might find it difficult to maintain had been preserved through the instrumentality of a private company. They had effectually restrained the sale of ardent spiritsamong the Indian tribes. Of course that restraint
me les perfect as the borders of civilization were
approached. bt among the more distant tribes the comjpany had managed to exclude the sale of those ardent spints which were usually their bane and destruction. One striking fact might be mentioned to the credit of the company, that while during the last few years the most frightful scenes of carnage and confusion had taken place on the other side of the frontier, there had been absolute peace and goodwill within the limit of British authority. (Hear, hear.) This being the case, he was slow to believe that the conduct of this company to the native tribes could have been so reckless, so regardless of justice, and so inconsistent with humanity as some of their opponents had alleged. He had communicated with the Governor of Canada on the subject of this inquiry, and if the committee were appointed they would have the advantage of receiving statements and evidence from the Canadas. He doubted very much whether the constitution of the company were such as to encourage colonization. It was not likely that a tradig company should promote colonization, in whichthey could have no miterest save of the most indirect kind, while in some cases their interests must be altogether opposed to colonization. This part of the subject would, no doubt, receive the careful cousideration of the committee. The country in question was of the highest importance in regard to its political situation. It was admirably situated for the use and delight of man. It enjoyed an excellent soil, abounded in minerals, possessed valuable fisheries upon its shores, and was most conveniently situated for that Pacific trade which was becoming of so much importance. Another settlement had grown up within the limits of the company's terrtory-the scettlemenatton the RendRiver-whe wsteo tho

nrgne non. friend must know that kings of England had granted charters not only contradictory in themselves, but in contravention of the rights of British subjects, and that Charles IL had no power to give what was given by his charter to the Hudson's Bay Company. (Hear, hear.) James I. gave to the Virginia Company the sovereignty over the whole of America from the Atlantio to the Pacific, frorm Canada to Panama, but he had no power to make that grant. The case was the same witb regard to the Hudson's 3ay Company's charter, but, even if it were not, the House would have a difficulty in saying that the rights of the company should he upheld in opposition to the interests of iumanity. He was doubtful as to the accuracy of his right
on. friend's statement that the company had taken care of the redmen. He knewthe country, and he knew that contests had taken place in it which might be compared with some of the most barbarous struggles that had ever occurred in Europe. His right hon. friend must have heard of Lord Selkirk and of the combats in the neighbourhood of the Red River, which would not have disgraced the best armies of Europe. The company were beyond the reach of the Colonial-offlce, they did what they pleased, and the slaughter of the red men and the conduct of all parties conceined was disgraceful to a Christian and civilized nation. (Hear.) It was very well to say that the company took care of their territories, but what had they done with Vancouver's Island? They bad kept it a solitude. (Hear, hear.) If they had acted with the object of promoting the interests of ther country they would have made Vancouver's Island a colony, a settlement ; but they had only acted s fur merchants, they had done everything-in their power to increase the number of foxes, wolves, bears, and martens, and to prevent tho increase of men. (Hear, hear.) Her should have thought that his right hon. friend, after an examination of the facts of the case, would have arrived at the conclusion that the existence of the company witiLthepowers they now possessed was inconsistent with the great object of civilization, and would have proposed a bill talking away thgo
.powers. Hisright -hon. friend ad however, pursued -a different course, and he would not oppose it; but he gave notice' before entering this committee, that the objects he Ahould have in view would be civilization and colonizition, the creation of a home for a happy and numerous population, and the foundation of a great nation to check the predominance of tbe United States. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. ADDERLEYthoinight that the' inquiry proposed by thenright hon. gentleman was needless, but some of the opinions expressed by the right hon. gentleman had convmced hira that a select committee should be appointed in order to remove any doubt which might remain on the right hon. gentleman's mind as to the absolute necessity of opening this extensive territory to colonization. He should have supposed thatevery one would anticipate with eagerness the expiration of the two years which must elapse before it could be colonized and settled. If England did not allow it to be opened it would open either of itself or with the assistance of the lUnited States, and the real question, in his opiion, was whether it should continue to belong to the Queen or whether it should be annexed to the United States. (Hear, hear.) Va:ncouver's Island, which had been annexed to the Hudsons Bay territory in co nence of the greatest blunder ever committed by a Colonial Minister, was not only peculiarly rich in minerals and whale fisheries, but it was upon the line which would connect the Atlantic and the
Pacific, and its great mercantile value had been long ago foreseen by Mr. Pitt. It mattered little whether the charter of the company were valid or not; it could not be maintained in opposition to the rights and the necessities of mankind. (Hear.) There was no precedentinhistoryof an empire which had the power of declAring that a great continent should be locked up, that it
should be kept as a preserve for wild animals, and that it should produce nothing but fur. (gear.) For all the important purposes of commeree, traffic, colonization, and all the great objects interestin to humanity, the world was shut out of this enormous temtory on behalf of a small trading and exclusive company. (Hear, hear.) He did not believe the company's charter had the slightest validity, but if it had, it was impossible in these days forthe Crown of Great Britain to m tain such a principle. By
the express letter of their charter the, company were trustees for the colonization of the colony, and were bound to introduce religion among the Indians, but, as the hon. gentleman who had just sat down observed, how -was it wLble for a trading company to execute such a trust? order to execute it they mn.st destroy their own trading concern. The right hon. gentleman said that the company had good agents, but the question was not whether the Colonal-offico agents were more or less efficient than the company, for no one thought of hand-
ing over the colony to the Colonial-office. If the territory should be freed from the grasp of the Hudson's Bay Company he trusted that it would not be handed over to the
onial Dpartment, but to Canada, or that it would be formed into a colony to be mamtained by its own adminis-
tration. (Hear, hear.) Unlesssomethingofthiskindwere done the inhabitants would again do what they had done before,-they would petition the United States to be annexed, rather than remain under the tyranny of this exclusive trading company. He ventured to say that when the present motion ap red on the paper of the House so little was the Hudson's Bay Company in any man's thoughts that nine-tenths of those hon. members who read it conceived that there was some intention in the mind of the Colonial Secretary to raise the question whether this territory would be available as a penal settlement or not. He was happy, at all events, to find that there was no such idea in the right hon. gentleman's mind; and he was perfectly convinced that no such idea would be entertained by any hon. member who had had an opportunity of considerinm the question of penal settlements. That was a propostion loosely and ungnardedly made by writers who had not taken pains to consider the subject. At all events, one good would arise from the inquiry, for it would show by plain and intelligible evidence that if penal settlements were to be formed (which he doub+,-td) of all spots in creation this territory was not only the least advisabe, but the most impossible to be selected for that purpose.
Mr. E. ELLICE said that if anything were wanted to convince him of the necessity of the proposed committee of inquiry it was the speeches of the two hon. gentlemen who had just spoken, exhibiting, as they did, a total ignorance of the manner in which the Hudson's Bay Company had administered its affairs, and of the state of the population in their territory. He was not so much surprised that this should be the case on the part of the hon. gentleman oppo-
site (Mr. Adderley), because his attention perhaps had not
beforebeen directedtothe subject; but he was astonished at what had faUen from the hon. member for Sheffield, because
he naturally supposed that that hon. member, from his con-
nexionwith Canada, would haTe takenthe trouble to become acquainted with the real cir¢umst.nces of tle case. It was
preposterous to suppose that colonists would go to the un-
settled portion of the Hudson Bay Company's territory
until the better districts were occupied. It had been suzgested that it would be advisable to put an end to the Hud-
son Bay Company's charter, and to separate the connexion of the company with the colony. But had the hon. mem-
ber considered what government he would put there instead of the company's government? Had he considered the geographical circumstances, and the dif{iculties attending the question as between the red man and the white ? In the country governed by the company west and east of the Rocky Mountains there was in round numbers a population of 300,000 Indians. Their condition before the company became united into a compact body was one of bloodshed and constant riot and turmoil, but the company had not the monopoly of the country there the inhabitants of Canada being allowed to spread through the country
where they liked, and trade with the natives, offering to them that seductive article of barter-ardent
sp'rits; and the rivalry between two companies led to those acts of murder to which the hon. member for Sheffield had referred. However, since the two companies had been formed into one the state of tt s natives had sensibly and materially improved; and the law, so far as it could be, was well administered in the territory. Taken as a whole, the rule of the company was a good rule, and beneficial to the Indians - and in proof of this he remarked that whlile the number of the Indians in the United States had been gradually dwindling down, until they were almost utterly extinguished, yet in the company's territory, with the exception of the immediate neighbourhood of the Red River, the Indians had incresied, and were increasing. This increase must have resulted from the means of subsistence and comfort pro-
Tided for them, as the Indians themselves were careless and improvident. One of the chief businesses of the company was to provide for these Indians large supplies sent out from this country, and the company actually kept in their territory one whole year's necessaries and comforts in advance, lest a sudden want should fall upon them. If their ships were prevented from entering the bay the whole of the supplies would be stopped, and resort must be had to the stores in hand. He freely admitted that a fur trade company had no business with colonization, but the Hudson's Bay Company was not the only instance of colonization being undertaken and carried on by a trading company; and he thought that the fact that the colony was inclined to attach itself to the United States ought to induce Her Majesty's Government not to think too lightly of the claims of the compan to those rights which they had en-
joyed for upwards o t 200years, and which, whether w ell founded or otherwise, had been frequently;recognized by Parliament. A great saving had been effected by the monopoly which had been granted to the company, for the
whole of the expenses of the colonization of the Hudson's Bay territory had been defrayed by the company. The Government would find that the company was quite prepared to take any course with regard to Vancouyeers Island which might he deemed just.
Mr. GLADSTONE.-Sir, it is one of the misfortunes of the vast extent of this empire and the multiplicity of its interests that there are many subjects of the utmost importance and of the deepest interest to which it is frequently impossible to draw the attention of the Hoese or the country. Such, Sir, is the subject now before us. I hope that, as it has at length come inder our consideration, it will be possible to obtain for it some portion, at least, of the attention which it deserves; and I cannot but render my thanks to my right hon. friend the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who has been the first among the administrators of that department to take a step which promises to bring it effectually under the consideration of the House. Nor can I agree with my hon, rfiend the member for Staffordshire, though I join in his sentiments, if he meant to imply that the Secretary for the Colonies committed an error in referring this subject to a committee, beceuse, although I think that a Minister might perfectly well, upon his own knowledge and means of information, adopt his own plan and recommendit to Parliament, yet, considering the peculiarity and strangeness of the subject, I ihink that if he adoDted that course he would probably flnd
hincelf under the disadvantage of addressing unprepared minds. By making the proposition now before the House hehassociates the Housewith his labours, and gives us a guarantee that whenxever positive and definite plans are submitted to Parliament they shall be plans for the reception and discussion of which many members, at least, of this house will have been prepared. I therefore thank my right hon. friend for the proposition that he has made, and I am bound to -ay, turning to my hon. friend on
the fourth bench (Mr. E. Ellice),-though I do not join with th in th e sweeping censure nhich he has pronounced
on the hon. gentleman below me (air. Roebuck), and on my hon. friend opposite (Mr. Adderley )thatI thank him also, on the part of the country, for the disposition which he has shown to throw open the whole merits of this very interestiog question by becoming himself a partner with the Government in enabling %arliameut to discharge this, I must say, long neglected portion of its duty. Having. Sir, said this much, and fully granting that we are not to blame the Hudson's Bay Company for having taken advantage of the powers which we have been imprudent enough to leave in its hands, I must at the same time say that I do feel it has been not only an error, but almost a scandal to this great assembly that we never have considered with the seriousn es5 it requires the condition and the fortuneg of that large. portion of the surface of the globe which is, or purports to be, under the jurisdiction of the Hudson's Bay Company. (Hear, hear.) And I hope my right hon. friend has fuly measured the great scoPe
of the subject which he is now going to submit to this commnittee. Tbere will be no doubt an inquiry, and I have not the slightest desire to anticipate a judgment unfavourable to the co avompany. Tht inquity wi no doubt be conducted
ith t t ust eJt co which characterizes every iquiry adopted sinderthe sanction ofthis House. F urther, I have no doubt that if the committee should come to the concluson (which I cannot think irprobable) that it would be well that the relationg of tho Hudson's Bay Company with this vast territory should be oiroumspeetly and gradually giver a up, a temperate coun i rill by bp by the Goversment nan by
maydeem ideenttedentit}edto prefer sln e fairly considered. There reman twro questions which the committee must not and cannot refuse to look in the face. One is the legality of the title -of the companay, and the' other the expediency
an!h prdnce of codnteo iatuing to thate empapyytthe o'
i
verement of -thesevetterritories;- -o, the- -legality-of the - title of the company I myself aboutt seven yeas ago suecetded to a certain degree in alling the attentior of the House; but I regret to say that the measure to which the House and the Govemrnment of that day wag entizely frustrated and made barren of effect by the course
hinch was adopteI by the then Colonial Minister. Hera is a case in which there is a charter of Charles
I., Rhich purporta to grant to a certain company
of adventurers powers of government that m.ay b' cadled pretty nearly absolute, and powers of trade which are rigi ly exclusive. Now, Sir, it is material-material to the present interests of the country-material, I will even y, to constitutional principles and to personal libertiestt it should be known whether a charter so granted by Ihe Crown is or ig not valid. (Hear, hear.) And here I cannot qssite subscribe to the doctrine of my rig?t honi. friend (Mr. Labouchere). This charter has neveyr, I lieve, been brought under judicia consi deration, but it appears to sne-though on this point I spek with less confidence, because years have elapsed since I looked carefully into the Eubject-that the records and history of the c;se and the important documrents bearing upon it, so far as they go, are nrot favourable to the legality of the charter. The charter was granted in the year 1670, and an important part of its provisions was that the comnpanyshould makee eertions to discover anew pasg into the South Sea. All. those expeditions which have been made by the adventurous navigators of England during the 19th century, at an enormous cost to this country, ought, by rights, t'have been paid for out of the revenues of the Hudson-s Ba-y Company. (Hear, kear.) It was the discovery Of A new passage into the South Sea which was the moving consideration with Charles IL, and even the Government of his day, when they committed these exclusive privleges to that company. The Hudson's Bay Comnany
aving obtained the privileges entirely forgot the great object of the niorth-wes t pg-ad left to others the dutty of conducting that matter and f payig for it. my hon. fijend (Mi-. Ellice) is not rigt" when bie speaks of this titlo as one which has enured with lapse of time, and has passed without question from generation to generation. The charter was granted in 16o. In 1690 an act of Parliament was passed, from the terms of which there arises a very strong presumption of the invalidity and iUegality of that charter. It is called, " An act for confirming to the governor and company tradin to Hudson's Bay their privileges and trade." The preamble recites pretty nearly the terms of the charter, and then proceeds to state that the governor and company have gone to great expense in the prosecution of the objects of the charter. The act then provides that the powers conferred by the charter shall be valid and that the company shall be a body corporate. Even the phraseology of the act indicates the suspicion of its framers that at that period the charter was not worth the parchment on which it was written, because it says that "the immunities, privileges, and oDwers," and so forth, "shaU be allowed and given, whic were thereby given, granted, or demitted, or mentioned to be given, granted, or demitted to the said company." You will say that made the company a bod; corporate and settled the whole question. Very far from a, for the last words of the act are-" Provided always that this act shaU continue to be in force for the time of seven years from this, and to the end of the next session of Parliament, but no longer." (Hear, hear.) Therefore, I think that my hon. friend below me (Mr. Roebuck) and my hon friend opposite fMr. Adderley), who cast doabt up n the title of this company, were not open to the charge of gross ignorance which was made sgainst them. The question of the legality of this charter is, I am aware, one which it is impossible to discuss with advantage at present, but I wish to show that it is one which the committee must take into consideration. It ma be eaid that this title was never questioned during the whole of last century. Daring the whole of last century the affairs of the Hudson's Bay ompany were a perfect bagatelle. The spirit of monopoly operated upon that company with its usual effect, and reduced it to a state of lethargy and torpor. It never extended its settlements except to short distances and in a narrow line from Hudson's Bay. I have not seen the hooks of the company, but my hon. friend Mr. Ellice) has the means of examirii them, and I nave not the least doubt he wiU find thae the transactions of the company at that period were extremely limited. They had to face wintry seas, a hungry soil, and a most rgorous climate. They had not then found their way into the heart of the country, nor begun to eat-in the sense in which they now eat-of the fa: of the lnd, in the shape of great additions to nominal capital ard vast accumulation of aividends The history of this matter is mo3t curious, While the Hudson's Bay Company, paralyzed by monopoly, was conducting its operations in the spirit in which a snail conducts its march -an opposite spirit-somewhat of a bucaniering, but also a freetrading spirit-sprang up among persons in Canada, who without the assistance ofthe Legislature organized themselves under the name of the North-West Company, pierced into the territory of the Hudson's Bay Company, and founded pretty nearly all the stations at which for the last 30 or 40 years the Hudson's Bay Company have been doing an extensive trade. Then came that glorious chapter in British history, that state of lawlessness whichl oversDread the territory when bloody battles-because one ought to give them their right namewere fought in order to conquer the valuable privileges of the trade which had been opened by the esergy of the North-West Company. At that time it became worth while to inquire into the charter of the Hudson's Bay Co-
pany. If you ask why the charter was little gnestioned during the last century, my answer is, because theinterest in the question was in the main a public interest, and it was not worth the while of anybody to incur the costs and anxieties of going intoa courtof law toraise against a comparatively powerful body a question in the issue of which he liad no more interest than had the whole trading community. But when this North-West Company had been organized the case was very different. That company, under the direction of its energetic and able managers, and with the assistance of its good advisers in this country (of wbom my hon friend knows something), took opinions upon the legality of the charter of the Hudson's Bay Company. Thereowas a long pursetopayfor these opinions and those of very eminent counsel, unless I am mistaken, of Lord Brougham and Mr. Serjeant Spankie, were obtained. These opinions wereextremelyunfavourable to the-validity of the charter, Inthisstateofthings-there beimg on the one side the Hudson's Bay Company, with its charter and its quasi-legality, and on the other the North-West Compay, with its energy, with its developed trade, and wirh its stations, but with no legal privileges-that happened which now commonly happeus between two railway companies when they have quarreled. The two companies laid their heads together. The North-West Company made to the Hudson's Bay Company a present of its stations and its energy, the Hudson's Bay Company giving to it the credit attaching to its long prescription and the form or mask, or whatever it might be, of a legal charter. Upon that footing the twoparties coalesced, and they have since carried on the trade much to their own satisfaction. (Hear, hear.) That I believe to be a very summary, but I think, in the main, a true sketch of the extremely curious history of these transactions. From these circumstances will arise the duty of the committee to take measures to ascertain a matter of so much interest to the personal rights of EDglishmen, especiaUy of Englishmen engaged in trade, as the extent of the power of the Crovwn to erant these exclusive privileges. As to the prudence and expediency of entrusting to the Hudson's Bay Company, or to any company whatever, the exclusive government of this vast territory, I confess I entertain the strongest opinions. It appears to me to be an abnegation and renunciation by England of a great part of her duty and of her advantages when she consents to lock against the energy of her children a vast country like this, in which, notwithstanding the discouraging future my hon. friend has given of its climate and its condition, and without allowing for the changes which, as the hon. member for Sheffield juslly says, might occur to the climate and soil with the progress of colonization-notwithstanding for these disadvantages, and withoat counting upon those advantages, is a country in whicb, nnless I am-greatly misinformed, there is even now considerable Ecope for the commercial spirit and energies of En nd. There are qauestions which must not be prejudged That as to the legabty of the charter will, I hope, ho sifted to the bottom, but I also trust that it Will be sifted by means into which partiality cannot enter. (Hear, hear.) The fair way of deciding this question is that which our ancestors adopted, not that which was dopted in 1849. The course taken was that an cr parte statement of their case was obtained from the Hudson's Bay Company, and that was submitted to the law officers of the Crown. Such a cousse can hardly be caUed other than childish and illuive. I apprehend that the course to be taken is that which woulti have been followed in the arbitrary times of the Stuartsnamely, where a Sovereign hd granted a charter which he had no right to grant, that the question at issue should be brought beforeajudicial tribunal. Some such proceedine as that would, I believe, meet the justice of the case, and give perfect satisfaction to the country with respect to the legality of the charter. (Cheers )
Mr. HENLBY said, so far as he could collect from the statement of the Secretary for the Colonies it did not aprear that any information had been given to the people of Canada of theointention of the Government to deal with this question; and what hs feared was that the Government were actuated by a foregone conclusion in entering upon it. He also apprehended that, though in these times inteligence was quickly communicated from one Fart of the world to uanother, consid r- ing the distance of the territory from this country enidence might ce brought before the committee very much* of a one-sided character, and therefore that there might not be afair and dispassionate inquiry into the suzbject. He hhoped, howvever, that his apprehensions were groundless in
teatrespect. Itwas quite cear, with regaTdtotwoportions of tbe territory, that they were open to be dealt with i any way that Parliament might see fit ; but as to that portion held under the charter, be agreed that the charter
whic hitherto had received no judicial confirmation what. ever, ought to be submitted to a tribunal properly invested with the power to decide the question of validity. If the charter was valid and good it ought to bo dealt with in a fair and equitable manner ; but if it was not, the question stood in an entirely different position, and he hoped it 'Would be thoroughlyinvestigated by the committee. Unless it came out in the inquiry that the people could not, if otherwise circumstanced, have a better chance of spreadin
themselves and improving their corndition, be did not think
it desirable, or even possible, that they should be left in the
hands, for good or bad, of a company who, after all, must
manage the territory with a view to their pecuniary advan- I tage. They were a trading company, and though he could mot doubt that they treated the people subject tD them with a due regard to justice and humanity, stiU it was their main cbject to carry on their enterprise with a view to their owu
'He was glad this question was no longer to be kept in the background, and he trusted it would be subnutted to a fair and impartial investigation.
MIr. LAING said, if he had correctly understood the Secretary for the Colonies 2igatly, the right hon. gentleman pronounced the greater portion of the territory so be absolutely uninabited. He wished to correct what appeared to him to bo a little misapprehension on that point. As regarded that portion of the territory of the Hudson;e Bar Company which 14 north of Canada, he believed, though xt was not trictly speaking uninhabitable, it ws not ikely for some time to become oolonized; but. as rea garded the countr to the west ot the Rocky Mounts:sh
a very UTrE portion-or that ad £ Tery favourable climiati'"bile wit srepapct to the remainn- art~, lyiug to the west of Canada, he was enabled toatt, fyom Pertotah eommtbications he had had with geutlemes2 fromCn Cada and with aervants of the Hudson's Bay Cenpany, that the climate of that district Wsr tot excessively s"eYre, and was occasionally of a comparatively nild charaeter. It also seemed ather like a dispenstion of Provid etbthW the mean of water accommodation had been given to soften the rigours of the clmate in part of the country whest it wi
revere. It ehould, on the other hand, be rememubered that the tide of emigration in the UJnited States was settiag now mcst strongly in the direction of the adjoining terrtory of Minnesota. B3ides, of aU the railroads in the north prbot the United States there were none paying so well as those of the State of Wisconsin pointing towards the territory of the Hudson's Bay ConDany, and if any attempt were made to shut out coonization the reslt would he that the border populatioi of the United States would, go over in spibt of such attemnt, and serious difficulties might anse with the United States. Heconsidered the best cous would betomaketheterritory a part of Canada, as ho knew a strong feeling upon the subject exsted in that colony. Re hoped that in the committee full opportunity would be given to members of the Canadian Legilature who felt great interest in this matter to explain their views as weU as the Hudson's Bay Company, who, being on the spot, might be presumed to have some little advantago over them.

DISQUALIFICATIONS OF NATIVES OF THE
IONIAN STATES.
Mr. LABOUCEERE B gain rose for the purpose of asking leave to introduce a bil to ensrble subjectsof the lonian State to hold commissons in Her Majesty's naval and military services. The inhabitants of the Ionian Islanddts were at present placed in an anomalous position, being in a certain sense British subjects, while they were debarred from enjoying all the rights and privileges n which other of Her
asty's subjects Participated. One of the disabilities under which they laboured was, that no native of the ionrn Is]ands could hold a commission under the Crown, and the object of theohil which he askel leave to introduce was to get rid of that diabislty. The matter had been brought to his notice by the circumstance of a young man of good family and character, anativeof tIhese islands, wishing to enter the v Sonitary service of thisecountry. Tho Coin mander-in-Chief was wMling to grant hima conmnsequon but the law officers of the Crown,u being consulted, weureiof o on that it would be illeglrintbeWprese,it state of the law. He found that several cofmeissioners of the Ionian Islands had expressed opinions incfavonr of the removal of this disability, and Sir J. Youing had stated that he rered
fsi osdsr be. Theihth i man then formafynmoved fer lecve to introunce the
Colonel DUNNE asked whether it was intended to naturalize all the inhabitants of the Ionian Islands, or ouly such as might become soldiers?
Mr. LABOUCERBE said, the biplwould only place the inhabstants of the lorean ands in the same position as the inhabitants of any of our colonies, andwould not otherwise affect their sateus.
The motion was agreed to, and theibil was read a first time.
ECCLESIASTICAL GOVERNMEk'p OF NORFOLK
ISLAND.
Mr. LABOIJCHERE, in moving for leave to bring in a bill to alter the existing provisions relating to the ecclesiastical government of Norfolkt Island said it was intended to rectify an omission in the arrangement made two years ago. The Houise was probably aware that the destination mfkNorfolk Island was changed, and, instead of being associated with the worst of our criminals, woulad in future, be g asociated with the inhabitants of Pitcairn's WIsand. Those persons, whose vrtaes and good conduct hadl excited so much intierest in this co-ntry, found Pituairn's Island too small, and, on their own application, were transferred to Norfolk Island, after the latter had been purged of its convict population. In reference to the chang., it was thonght best to tansfer the civil goverment from Tasmania to New South Wales; but the transfer of the ecclesiasticalgovemment was omaitted bThe consequence was that, whie Norfolk Island was under the civil jurisdiction of the Governor of New South Wales, it was under the ecclesiastical jurisdliction of the Bishop of Tasmania. Such
a state of things was obviously inconvenient, and thia bil SimTu transferred the ecclesiastical g ment from. the
iopof Tasmania to the) Bishop oSdny.
Lord R. CECIL asked whether the Bishop of Tasmania assnted to the bill and whether the change ought not to be made by- an order in Council.
3Mr. LABOUCHERE said, the pwer of changn the ecclesiastcal jurisdiction rested with Parliament. Heif did not know whether the Bishop of Tasmania had been in. formed of the intention to introduce the bill, hut he coald not imagine that the right rev, prelate would raise the least difficulty in such a matter.
Sir S. NORTHOOTE said, it was reported that 12 convicts had been left on Norfolk Island. He wished to know whether that was true ; and, if so, whether their being left was intentional or accidental?
Mr. LABOUCHERE said, no convict had been left behind. The Piteairn people had petitioned to have one old man who was well acquainted with the soil of the island left to teach them agriculture, buxt the Governor intended to supply his place in another way.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was subsquently read a first time.
MOTIONS ON ESTIMATE NIGaTS.
Mr. W. WILLIAM,S said, the important privilege of making motions on going into Committee of Supply ba of late years been so abused that he thought it ought to bo limited. If its use were confined to bringing forwardI great public grievances he would be the last to interfere, butt it was well known that members who balloted, and were unfortunate, afterwards availed themselve of this pririlege to moot questions in whichx they were interested. Amendments onx the question that the Speaker leave the chair scaLrcely ever had any practical result, hut the consequence was that counmtless milions of public mnoney were voted at unseaonable hours without anyo~portunity being afforded of their being properly consid,~c Private mnemiber-s had Tuesdays and Thursdays for motions, and Wednesdasfor
ures-n oement onlyhad Konda!,sand Frida, a for aU their business, and he thought it would not be too
much to limit the right of private members to interpOse with a motion before going into Committee
of Supply to one evening in the week. Last year the etimates amounted to so less than 90,00,0001. sterling, which wore usnally brought on ata late hour of the night. The present ystem was very inconvenient to those members who came down at 5 o'clock to take Part in the discussion on the estimates, and who were compelled to wait hour after hour listen'ng to the most idle talk possible. He understoodtheGovernment had no objection to this motion.
Ironical cries of " Hear, hear.") Ho understood tbat cheer, bnt if the Government wanted to prevent discussion on the estimates they would encourage motions which prevented it. He had known one or two occasions, not during the present Governient. when Mir. Hume left the house for a few minutes during one of those discussions before going into committee, and when the hon. gentleman who was sneakind
received a hint from tb Se §ec!4artotboTreasury to sit down. Hodidso, and whileMr.Humo wasabsenthalf-a. eozen votes amounting to miUions of money passed, so that when Mr. Hums returned he ws received with roars if laughter, moro front that (tho 1inisterial) sido of the house than thaother.

The Frauds On The City Banks.
THE FR¢A CDS OX THE CITY BANK.S.
Yesterday James Anderson aud James Townsend Saward, who have been repeatedly remanded upon charges of extensive forgeries and frauds upon many of the city bankinghouses, were again broaght before the LORD MfAYOR, am the Mansion-house, for further examination.
Tho court was very muoh crowded, and by tho side of ths Lord Mayor were Mr. Hankey, General Fox, Mr. Lowman, Mr. H. Lowmau Taylor, and many othera connected with mercantile pursuits.
Mr. Mullens, solicitor to the Committee of Bankers for Protection from Forgeries and Frautds, again attended oa the part of the prosecution.
Mr. Willam Ingersoll was sworn, and said,-I am cashier in tho honse of Messrs. Kinnaird and Co., of Austin-friars. The bil produced for 1,0001., purporting to be accepted by our firm, is a forgery. Tho biU for 2001. also produced, accepted by tho firm, is a genuine document, aud was left for acceptance by a man named Hardwicke.
Mr. D. Badwin.-I was agent for Messra. Smith and Knight, railway contractors, of Sydeaham. They kept an account with Messrs. Hankey and Co., the bankers. I1
August last I had authority to draw checks upon Messrs. Hankoy on behalf of Mes3rs. Smith and Knight. The threa checks producod for 1001., 100., and 501., purporting to bo signed by me aro not in my handlwriting.
Mr Elizabeth Attwood.-I reside at 18, flampton-streef, Gray's-inn-road. In September Last a person called uponr me aud hired lodgings in my houso for, as he said, a friend of his named Dixon. To tho best of my belief the prisoner Anderson is the man who hired the lodginga. A letter addressed to Mr. Edmund Dixon, and bearing the Yarmouth post-mark, was sent to my house, and was de3ivered to the person who hired my apartments.
Mr. A. W. Morris, a clerk in the country department ef Messrs. Barclay's bank, said,-In September last a sum of 2501. vas paid into our bank in the name of James Witney by the convict Hardwicke, who desired that it might be sent to Yarmouth. Some days afterwards tha prisoner Anderson called and requested that the sum should be advised in the name of James Ralph, so that it might be received in that name. I told him that the change in the namo could net be made without the authority of M. Witney, upon which he said that Mr. Witney had gone up the Rhine.
Mr. W. H.Knight.-I live at 17, Bayham-street, Camdenitown. Iam in the habit of frequenting the GreshAm Arms, in Wood-street. About six months ago I w.AS in the parlour of that house, when three persons entered it. I identify Atwell as one of the three, and have every reason to believe that Saward and Hardwick-e were the two others. I sawr
old p ass between them, and a book similar to the one protuced by Moss, the officer, was lying on the table before
John Moss.-I am a detective officer, belonging to the city police force. On Friday, the 26th of December, I accompanied Huggett (also a detective offioer) to 9, Johnstreet, Oxford-street. Wo knocked at the door and inquired for a Air. Hopkins. A woman who opened the door made a reply, upon which Huggett left for the purpose of ascertaining whether the information sho had given ns was correct. Shortlv after Huggett had gono I saw a door closed very gently. I immediately entered the room and saw Saward, and said to him, " Oh! Air. Hopkins, we have been looking for you for some time." He replied, "My nme is not Hopkins, Sir." I said "No I believe it is Saward." He replied "You are quite mistaken. What is it you want " I repHed, " I am one of the officers belonging to the city of London. I want you for forgery." At this time Iluggett returned. We then charged him with being concerned with Hardwicke,Atwell, andAnderson in forgin
a bill for 1,000L upon Messrs. Hayward and Co. He said that he knew nothing about it, and that he did not know the parties whose names we had mentioned to him. We told hm at he would have togo to the city with us, upon which he said, " I shall not go unless yoa force me." Huggett asl-ed him what force he required, upon which he replied, "Laying your hands on me." He then requested to be allowed to go to the closet. We told him that he might do so, bat that we must first see what ho had in his pockets. Hugeett searched him in my presence, and took from his pocket two blank checks upon the Cambridge branoh of the London and Westminster Bank. Saward said, " Oh, they are nothing -destroy them." We also took a small book from his g:cIset, which I produce. He made no further request t>
DMowed to go to the closet. We put him into a cab, and on our road to the city he said, "I suppose it's no uso holding out any longer; my name is Jem Saward."
Saward (interrupting).-1 said no such thing.
Moss.-We conveyed him to. Bow-lane station, where we charged him, and afterwards to the Mansion-house. When we got there he said-"- Oh, there's Mr. Mullens."
Saward.-I did not say so; I could not say so, because I did not knowMr. Xulleria. It was you vwho said it. It was the first time I had ever seen Mr. Mulens in my life.
Moss.-He said, "Tell him (blr. Mullens) I want to speak to him." Mr. MulUens returned with me, upon which Saward said to him, " Mr. Mullens, these men have thought pro er to take me into custody." Mr. lollens repliod,
Y es, quite right; by my directions." Huggett then took from his own pocket the two blank checks produced, and showed them to Mr. Mullens, upon which Saward said. "Oh, they are old checks. They are of no use. *Y: twon't make use of them, wiU you?" Mr. MuUeas replied, "I shall do nothing but what is necessary"
Sawar(d-What I s%id about' those cbecks was this, These two blank checls are of no use, they are 16 or 1T years old." They were dated 1840. I used one or two of them for waste paper, ay Lord. (Laughter.)
The LouRD ,IAYOR-You will have an opportunity o£ makingany observatlea you think proper by and by.
Mr. MLUens sid be had now closed the ease for the
prosecution.

London, Friday, February 6, 1857.
LONDON, FBTDAY, FBBRUARY 6, 1857.
In the House of Lords last niglht
Earl SPXNcXm, Lord Steward of the Household, brought up Her Majesty's answer to the Address.
A discussion then ensued with respect to the production of papers relating to the Persian and Chinese wars, in the course of which Lord CLARamDow declared that the documents relating to our quarrel with Persia would be laid before the House in a few days. The noble Lord also intimated his intention of producing certain papers connected with our diplomatic intercourse with China.
The Earl of CARDIOAN put a question to the SXCRETARY for WAR in reaard to a recent publication on the Crimean campaign, by an officer of the Staf, in which he asserted that his character had been maligned. Public opinion and the progress of legislation had almost abrogated what were termed " the laws of honour," and, having no other means of redress, he wished to know whether an officer who had disgraced himself by publishing false ftatemerits was to be permitted to remain on the Staff of the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland.
Lord PAN?IrIsR admitted that the noble Lord had been wantonly attacked, but thought, considering that he had received the thanks of Parliament for his services in the Crimea, he could afford to despise the attacks of one in a subordinate position. It was not the intention of the COs313ANDER-f-Cl..F to bring the officer in question to a court-martiaL
The Earl of MALMESBUTJY moved for certain returns connected with the proceedings of the Commissioners for disafforesting the New Forest, and complained of the injustice which characterized those proceedings.
After considerable discussion, in which Lord G.ANvrrrY, the LORD (}IANOELLOR, and Lord CA.aPBELL took part, the returas were ordered.
Lord BanNERS moved for return3 sbowing the number of tickets of leave issued to convicts in each year since the commnencement of that sybtemn, specifyig their original sentence, their unexpired time, the number reapprehended after release, the fresh charge, and the result of the investigation.
After a short discussion the return was ordered, with an amendment proposed by Lord M o- who suggested that the number of convictS with tickets of leave reapprehended without having commnitted any fresh offence should be distinguished in the return.
their Lordships then adjourned. In the House of Commons,
MIr. LAnuowis2xn,in moving for a select committee towconsiderthe state of the Britir possesfion with Ncorth eaerica under tde administration of thf Hudson's Bay Company, or over which they pO3!e33 a license to trade, stated the d.azons why vg MIAJESTY'S Government deemed it incumbent upon ihem to call the attention of Parliament to the state P of those posse&sions, involving, he observed, ques-.
tions of imperial policy, humanity, and justice of no ordinary magnitude. He gave an outline of th.
territories over lthich the rights of the Company extended, explaining the Tariout tenures under which those rights were exercised aud eajoyed, and the manner in which they were mnanuged, especiallywith relation to the Indian tibes, towards whom, ho believed, the company had evinced a sincere desire to act with in ues3 and cordiality.
Mr. RosBuca said he thought Mr. LAOUTOHTAim might take a shorter course to attain the object in vieW. The Hudson's Bay Company were, by their yer7 constitution, opposed to colonization, and ho desired that BritishNorth America should bear the preponderance in fact which it did on the oma
agauist the growing power of the United States. Instead of encouraging settlement, however, the company acted upon the narrow policy of peltry .-erchants. The Governmnent should have proceeded at once to legilate.
Wr. ADDMUxY argued strongly against contimuing the exclusive privileges of the Hudson's Bay Company, whose duties as trustees for the colonizationof the territories were in conflict with their interests as commercial monopolists; and he taxed their administration witlh tyranny and oppression.
Mr. E. EL.IcE observed that the speeches of Mr. Ronucx and Mr. ADDBMLxv, which discovered total ignorance of the state of the territory, its population, and the government of the company, atiorded the strongest argumnent for inquiry before legislation. Hie th ought the company, who wished to put themselves in the hands of Parliament, had a fair claim to its favourable consideration.
Mlr. GLA.SmmoiE approved the proposal to refer this subject toaselect committee, which would have two questions to discuss-namely, the legality of the title of the com pany, respecting which grave doubts existed; and the expediency and prudence of their continuing to hold jurisdiction over those vast territories, the condition of which, he thought, it had been an error and almost a scandal that Parliament had never considered with the seriousness which the subject required. With reference to the last question it appeared to him that it was an abnegation ana -renunciation by England of her duty to lock up against the energy of her children a country which would afford a very considerable scope to their commercial spirit and enterprise.
M1r. HruuEy was apprehensive from the tone of Mr. LABoucmaes speech that the inquiry was intendedmerely to back up a foregone conclusion of the Government.
Mr. LAmIG was in favour of inquiry.
After some brief remarks by Mr. B3AILLIE and Mr. G. BuTr, and a reply by Mr. LABOUCnEP.E disavowing any foregone conclution upon the subject, the motion was agreed to.
Mr. LABoUCHEiBE moved for leave to bring in a bill to enable the subjects of the Ionian States to hold mnilitary and naval commissions under the Csowi, with a viewv of placing them upon the same footing in this respect as inhabitants of the British c-olonies.
Ieave was given to bring in the bill.
Mr. LAno-ucnmsm likewise obtained leave to bring in a bill to alter the existing Provisions relating to the ecclesiastical government of Norfolk Island.
hIr. W. WmLwI3m moved that notices of motions on going into committee of supply on the Estimates have precedence only on alternate days, comiplaining of what he considered to be the abuse of this practice, and the impediment thereby offered to Governmnent business.
The motion was seconded by Mr. WisE.
Sir G. GBEYv, admitting the inconvenience attendin te ratie,deln to abridge an ancient and The motion was withdrawn.
Leave was given to Mr. HADFIWD to introduce a bill to amend the law of imprisonment for debt, to extend the remedies of creditors, and to punish fraudulent debtors.
The House adjourned at half-past 7 o'clock.

If every tax in favour of which nothing can
If every tax in favour of which nothing can be said were doomed to immediate abolition, the CA&Ncrimon of the ExcmrxQR would soon be in straits for a revenue. The case against the Paper Duties is so simple that it may be left to the tiros of financial reform. As an undergraduate critic is sure to select Macaiday or Tennyson for the subje4t of his first magazine essay, so the impost on the material vehicle of lnowledge will always suggest itself as a ready theme of declamation to the political beginner. Everything that was urged by Mr. 1M&mmz GL3soN1 and his friends on Wednesday in their interview with the CHaNCELon of the ExxntEQrEr has been urged many times before, and has taken its place among the uncontradicted truths of economy. The Paper Duties press on literature, and ehiefly on cheap literature. The primer and copybook of the child, the newspaper and entertaining periodical of the working man, are taxed in a far greater percentage on their valne than the library edition which the rich book-fancier places on his shelves. A persevering publisher declares that in a course of years he has paid in Paper Duties five-eighths as much as he has paid for copyright and editorship; and that his success and the success of his literary friends have been correspondingly diminished. Another publisher of popular works has been obliged to discontinue the issue of a periodical because, though it had attained to a circulation of 60,000 copies, it was unremunerative, owing to the obnoxious impost. Continue the Paper Duty, and you check education; abolish the Paper Duty, and you confer a benefit, on the contrary, not inferior to those which proceeded from the establishment of cheap postage and rapid locomotion. Such are the arguments of the reformers, and no one can pretend to have an answer to them. If Sir COA?NmwA-LL LMwIs, or any other opponent, confines himself to the question as proposed by the objectors, he must speedily be defeated.
The one practical and conclusive answer, however, is that money must be had. The Paper Duty brings in a large annual sum; can this sum be spared? Of course, this is a mere temporary argument and does not touch the principle. But for a year,-or, perhaps, for longer,-we must be content to leave the principle alone, and argue the matter as one of expediency. We do not dloubt that eventually the Association for the Repeal of the Taxes on Knowledge may attain its end. It is a persevering body, and has already been twice victorious. When it commenced its labours a triple burden was alleged to weigh on the intelligence of the country. The advertisement duty was, to use the language of the Association, " a tax on wants." Air. GLADSTONE yielded to the pertinacity of his assailants, and now the wants of the community may be made k-nown free from the tributary eighteenpence. The second achievement was the abolition of the newspaper stamp. As the promoters of this measure declare that it has not had time to work, we wi forbear from any criticism of its merits. The third part of the programme has yet to be carried out, but we do not doubt that the zeal of the reforuers will ono day be rewarded. For our own. part, we have every reason to wish them success. The results of their two former exploits have certainly been anything but detrimental t6 the interests of this journal, and we can naturally have little objection to a change which would enable us to make a saving on every copy we publish. Therefore, when we have done with Persia and China, when the last bills for the late war are paid off, when there is a lull in the dockyards of Portsmouth and Chatham, when our army has settled down to its permanent numbers, and, consequently, when we have a large surplus, and half-a-dozen interests are demanding the firat share of relief, let us lend a willing ear to the anti-knowledge-tax agitator3. As mind is superior to matter, so we woldd sooner have the Paper Duty repealed than the duties on wine or tobacco. So let paper staid frst in the list for relief when we have anything to spare. But so long as the Income-tax is maintained the country must be content to bear the last and most burdensome of the taxes on knowledge.
The fact is, that the pressure of the Income-tax is so deeply felt that all other considerations must
give way to the necessity of easingthe public of this lated burden. Contrary to the theories of economists, and in spite of all who affect to prefer direct taxation, the British people have wisely determined to be rid of this most gxievous impost. To get rid of the war9d. now, and the other7d. as soon as possible, is the ruling desire of all classes, from peers to the pettiest tradesnmen. The question of the day is how this can be managed. The expenses of the late war have not yet been all met. There is no doubt that, vith all the efforts of tho CHANCeLLOn of the EXCBEQUER, the expenditure of the year will be very great. Consequently, the most that can be expected is to be rid of the extra Income-tax. Even for this we have been unvwilling to press too importunately, through a fear that it might be necessary to adopt the disgraceful substitute of a 1oan. But if it can be accomplished it is certainly as much as the country wishes or expects. Let the CHAxcuLLOn of the E,cmEQuiEp be allowed to concentrate his energies on this one achievement, and then prepare for our complete relief in 1860. The representatives of burdened interests must have patience until then. We hope soon to enter again into the calm and peaceful paths of reduced estimates and repealed duties. Then they will have their turn in order of desert. But, -for the present, let no Minister be able to urge as an excuse for keepingon a fractfon of the Income-tax the pretext that any section of the community is in the least degree indifferent to its abolition.

The question of the Estimates is attended this year
The question of theEstimates is attended this year vwith such extraordinary interest that our readers should knowexactly the conditions under which they are to be produced. Of course, the fact that the chief scope for aU financial modifications is to be found in the expenditure upon the war departments is a feature common to all years alike, but at present there is peculiar reason both for solicitude and hope. We have just concluded a great war, and are entering, as regards Europe, upon our first year of peace. This naturaUy warrants a large reduction in the war Estimates, while at the same time a tax regarded with especial impatience is avowedly left to depend for its continuance or diminution upon the aspect -which these Estimates present. In point of fact, the battle of the Income-tax will be fought and decided on the figures produced by Lord PAxNunE and his colleagues. Omitting the extreme opinions which on this, as on al other questions, wiUl find some advocates, we do not anticipate any substantial diversity of views. Everybody admits that we are not, as the phrase goes, to "become "a military nation,"-i.e., that we are not to assimilate our system to that of the continental States, which are overrun with soldiers, and whose policy involves the constant maintenance of prodigious armies. On the other hand, after what we have seen and felt lately, the PRnim
lmIs,rnn's -ords, that " it is important to utilize " the experience which we have gained in the last ' war," will, we are sure, find an echo in the country. We are now exactly in the best position for setting our establishments in order. We have found out our weak points and learnt how to strengthen them; above all, we have been taught that an aggregate of regiments, however excelent, does not mak-e an army, and that other corps, less numerous, but more speciaUy trained, are absolutely necessary to enable the powers of this army to be developed. Mr. GLADSTOb', very well observed the other day, that the propositions on both sides of the question, when confined to generalities, simply represented a couple of truisms, and that the only sensible method of proceeding was to bring each point to the test of actual figures. When we see what is asked for this or that department of the service, we shal then be able to corclude with some precision whether the demand implies any new-fangled excess, or whether it is really measured by the suggestions of political wisdom.
There was one feature appearing for the first time last year on the face of the Estimates to which it is impossible to take exception, and that is the consolidation and arrangement of all the military charges under one head. Formerly the Ordnance Estimates were entirely separate, and it was necessary to add the various demands together before we could ascertain what " the army" realy cost. Last year this system was reformed, and the Army Estimates comprehended and exhibited the charges not only for the Cavalry and Infantry, but for the Artillery, the Engineers, the Comniissariat, and so forth. The highest point reached by these combined figures was at this time last year, when the total demand for the Army under all heads, effective and noneffective, was as nearly as possible 35,000,0001. This was not, in point of fact, the shape ultimately assumed by the Estimates, for the prospects of peace were disclosed at a sufficiently early period to admit of reductions in the proposals before the House, and the figures descended very considerably. However, for purposes of comparison between Peace and War, it will be best to omit the intermediate stages of decrease, and to look at the actual war Estimates for the army, by way of obtaining a proper contrast for the forthcoming Estimates of peace.
This time last year we were proposing to maintain for the military service of the country 248,716 nmen of all arms and ranks, exclusive of H:BR YuJxsTVs troops in the East Indies ;-that is the first great fact to be borne in mind. The next point to be clearly comprehended is the proportion borne in these numbers by the special corps to the remainder of the army; and it is found that, while the Cavalry of the Line were 15,509, and the Infantry 154,140, the Artillery were 23,491, and the Engineers 4,074. Again, to compare the actual and inimediate charge incurred by this body of men with the total charge for the wrhole military service, we find tlhat our 250,000 troops cost less than 11,000,0001. out of the 35,000,0001., although, of course, we cannot fairly separate from this item the expenses of their maintenance and equipment, includedunderthelargedemand-almost lO,OOO,0001.-made for clothing, barrack furniture, provisions, forage, &c. If to the 21,000,0001. thus composed we add 4,000,0001. for stores (including the requirements of the sea service), 3,000,0001. more for the Militia aud 2,000,0001. for Works and Buildings, we shall arrive at as close an analysis of the whole charge as is necessary for our present purpose.
Owing to the difference in the form given to the Estimates it is not easy to institute a detailed comparison of previous years with that referred to above; but if we take 1853, as the year last preceding that of the war, we shall get two or three noticeable points of contrast. The numbers given in the last paragraph exclude those of the troops of the Line serving in India, but ii we add these we shall find, as a general conclusion, that in February last our Estimates provided for 17,088 Cavalry, 178,924 Infantry, and 28,165 Artillery and Engineera1-altogether 224,177 men of all ranks, exclusive of the Guards, Foreign Corps, Colonial Corps, &c. Aidopting the same reckoning for 1853, wee find upon the whole something like 10,000 Cavalry and 105,000 Infantry of the Line, and upwards of 17,000 Artillery and Engineers, maling a total of 132,000, or thereabouts; so that about 90,000 men were added for the demands of war. The mere numerical iner6ase of men, as we observea the other day, is not the chief cau se of the largely-* increased expenditure which active hostilities
entail, but it is, of course, a leading feature in any such computations, and the figares given will pre. pare the reader for those to come.
Contrasting our position with that of four years mince, we have no difficulty in putting our fingers upon the points where improvement was called for, and where it may probably be still continued with more or less advantage. Mr. GLADSTONz observed on Tuesday, with the assent of the House, that " whatever tended to the physical comfort of the "xoldier, whatever tended to the recognition of the "fair claims of the officer, whatever was necessary "to attract into the service of HBB MAJESTy the "highest class of men, both as regards mental and "bodily qualities, would never be grudged." But this, though a truly popular view of the subject, is not quite a complete sketch of the necessities of the case. To make the officers and men thus attracted to the profession of arms a really efficient body, they must have the best of weapons, the best of accessories in the foran
of special corps, and the best of training in all those practices which war requires. It was not merely that our troops required such an improvement in their general condition as would raise the character of recruits, but that the auxiliary departments of the army demand, estora. tion or enlargement. The successes of ICu4's we have recently seen, depend upon many things besides the number or the courage of the soldiers engaged. In fact, the march of science in these respects is every day diminishing the relative value of numerical strength and elevating that of skilful resource. The saying ascribed to the Duke of WELLINGTON the other night, that 5,000 British troops, if adequately sup. plied, could be easily marched from one end of Asia to the other, shows how little depends upon numbers, and how much upon appliances. These, then, are the points to which we trust to see attention directed-the careful maintenance and improvement of those corps which cannot be suddenly or hastily raised, the equipment of every arm of the service on the best known principles, the organization of the whole on the most approved plan, and such a position given to the individual soldier as shalt insure, when combined with a wellprepared system of operation, an abundant and ready supply of recruits in time of need. That such a course of proceeding is compatible with large retrenchments is plain, and we hope to find it shown that it may consist also with abso!ute and imnaediate economy.

Last Tuesday witnessed the first instalment of the
Last Tuesday witnessed the first instalment of the great annual migration of the upper English classeg of society to London. The business of the nation brings up the first division, fashion will in due course bring up the rest, and round the nucleus of Parliament will grow up that great system of pleasure, elegance, luxury, and social ambition called the London season. Is this great world before its annual gathering inclined to hear a lecture t If it is, it may hear it in the speeches of the Bishop of LoXDON and Mr. GLADsrTON in the Stepney Schoolroom. The subject of those speeches is almost too suitable for this great occasion, and is open to the criticisni
of bringing unwelcome news too early before the gathering fashion of the country. The burden of tho lecture is to remind the West of London of the East, the rich of the poor, " the great cities on the "North and the South of iyde Park, with their "splendid streets, spacious squares, and richly. "embellished shops," of the poverty and struggling life of those eastern districts " removed out " of sight, and, unhappily, out of mind," which that very western luxury has called into life. " East" goes side by side with " West," as Bfx. GIADSTONJS remarks, by a natural law; no great accumulation of luxury and wealth can ever be formed without a corresponding growth of a laborious and strmggling class of poor to sustain and minister to it.
It is rather hard that in proportion as a great class is useful to us we should be disposed to forget its claims on our gratitude. But this has always been the case with respect to the claims of the poorer classes. Their very usefulness as instruments and machines for the creation of luxury and wealth has occasioned the tendency in all ages and in all states of society to look upon these classes simply as instruments and machines. The harder they have worked the more they have seemed born for work, and nothing else; that has appeared their proper lot, and in fulfilling it they have seemed to do nothing more than what every tool does that answers its proper use. Hence the almost total division of the classes of rich and poor in classical times. The existence of an oppressed and ground-down class, deprived of the main comforts and pleasures of existence, was not the slightest difficulty to an ancient philosopher; it was no more an obstacle to him than the exist ence of stone or iron, or any other necessary material which we use for our purposes. This class was the machinery which nature provided for us to supply our physical and social wants, and, when the classical division of mankind into slave and free was over, human pride had still the medieval aristocratical system to repose upon-a system which substantially regarded the lower classes as different beings from the upper, incapable of ever rising to their level, and separated by an impassable barrier of nature from their communion. This structure of pride, which was as really oppDsed to Christianity as the Hindoo division of castes or any other idolatrous creation, has happily long passed away, at least in this country, and if a feeble, sickly son or daughter of fashion here and there retains a relic of it, they have to keep it to themselves ; the hothouse sentiment has to stay at home ; it cannot come out into open day -and be publicly acknowledged; a sincere respect for the great working class of modern society in all its gradations is the understanding on which every English statesman holds his place.
But, though the old marked divisions of classical and mediieval times are over, the difference of education and of our whole mode of life does still, it must be confessed, make such an enormous division between rich and poor that it is very difficult for the two classes to carry on much real communion. Difference of education and mental development is the great division now, as birth ras in former times. It is not, perhaps, too much to say that the duty of the rich seeing and having something like intercourse with the poor is very largely felt now, but, while it is so very commonly-felt, the great difference of education makes such intercourse almost more difficult than it was in less civilized days, such as those described by MAr. MIICAULAY, for instance, when English gentleimen talked tho language, with the knowledge, of their grooms. The very homely sons and daughters of the old manorhouse had really less to divide them from the poor than the educated and refined portion of modern society has, whose only idea 4 sosiaI intercourse is intimately connected witriio intellect. 'Hence it is that with this duty so largely felt it is comparatively so very little fuilled4 A person of the upper or educated classes goes into two or three poor people's houses, lie sits down, begins to tallk, tries to make himzself agreeable, and to elicit common points. :But he finds his progress, though as far as it gocs good al.d useful, very soon stopped by an invisible barrier which no effort can surmotunt. He finds a difficulty in expressing himself naturally, simply because his education necessarily puts things before him in a diffeezLt
Iight from that in which a poor person eees them. .Ie feels himself unable to say th ings wbich he would like to say, and, which hie would say in talking to his equals. There is a sunk fence btetween the two; he is shut within rails, mnd must talk within a groove; lie has to 'check himself in his natural expressions; he has to keep a perpetual watch over his own -mnd, to prevent himself from outstepping the 'charmed ring within which all communication must alke place. Now, it is quite true that under such -circumstances a person of original or simply a *trong natural character will hit on common points -of interest, and elicit the latent symupathies and understandings of a common nature, reason, and teart. But many a well-disposed person will tind his chariot-wheels driving heavily over this unyielding ground, not to say occasionally even sstuck in the mud. Of course, it is easy to have recourse to a formal religious sentimiient in your difficulty, to a text of Scripture, or a moral admosnition; but no person of sense likes to take advantage of such a stiff and trite mode of escape; he 'wants his intercourse with the poor to be as -matural as circumstances permit, and not to produce 1the jmpression on his inferior neighbour that he is jeating him quite different]y from his equal. Mddation thus creates a most formidable barrier between rich and poor even when other obstacles aiave given way. Education throws us more and more on the society of our equals for pleasure, -excitement, stimuilus, and communion of thought.
But what does this prove ? Why, simply that all ages have their difficulties and their own peculiar obstacles to duty. There is nothing here but -what good feeling may overcome; there is, we are tappy to see, a strong struggle going on to over-come it. People are aware that something must be done to break down that extreme barrier between rich and poor under which we have been suffering. One man gives a lec-are; another sets up a society; M.P.'s now zcknowledge the existence of their poorer constituents at other times than elections; the clergy visit much more than they did; Mr. MAunIcE 'sets up his "Working Mauns Association;" Mr. RowsmrL his "Church Schoolroom for the
' Labouring Class." All this is an improvemnent, even if it only showvs that people's minds are uneasy. An enlargement of the old stiff .ground is evidently wanted, and if the wish is -sincere, as it seems to be, it wil fulfil itself in some way or other.

A very large proportion of the miseries of
A very large proportion of the miseries of 'civilized life arises from bad and dishonest servants. We are, indeed, well aware there are many -thousand servants who are endeavouring to discharge their duty respectably and to the best of their ability. Happy is that family rwhich possesses one of the number, for its rulers are spared many grievous trials of temper and snany embarrassments of the most painful kind. When we denounce bad servants we do so quite as nuch in the interest of good servants as in that of 'cmployers. The bad servants generate suspicion and 'distrust against the whole class. How is it to be -expected that a master and mistress yet smarting -under the dishonesty of a butler, the inebriety of a cook, the pertness of an Abigail, or the wayward affections of a housemaid or nursemaid, can receive under their roof with any peculiar satisfaction a iresh representative of any of these classes ? If we leave out of the question ladies of the 'highest fortunes-and they suffer frightfully from 'the tyranny of their immediate attendants-we 'will venture to say you would not find five per -cent. among the matrons of London who could not
'tell you how their existence has been embittered and their homes rendered miserable by the mis'conduct of their servants. Ail due deductions being made for their own want of temper, want of ;ystem, want of discretion, there stil remains great foundation for the charge. Now, we want to-day to give one main reason why there are to many bad servants, and to illustrate our position by a most striking example which has just been brought under public notice in the course of a Queen's Bench trial. It is because employers are so careless in the matter of " characters," as 'they are called, that bad servants are enabled to circulate so long from house to house, and -that there are so many of them in circulation. NTow, we are weeU aware that the law does not allow that a servant's character should be taken away -upoIn slight or insufficient grounds-and rightly so,-but the law will always permiit a master to assign the reason why he has discharged a 4servant from his employ, if the reason be not one of idle and defamatory suspicion. What generally 'lappens, however, is that an employer, for some ,cause or other, and most frequently for a substantial one, becomes dissatisfied with a servant, and yet does not wish to feel that he or she is turned into the street to starve. The easiest way of getting out of the difficulty is to give such a character as 'will gain for the servant another situation. This is done to a most incredible extent; the natural consequence is that a bad servant-ay, a dishonest one-finds it almost as easy a matter as a good one to get a fresh situation. A more thoroughly anprincipled proceeding, or a greater treachery against society, can scarcely be conceived.
The case which was tried on Tuesday and Wedinesday of the present week at Westminster amoiunted to this:-Mr. LAUNCELOT SHADWELL, a barrister, and therefore a man who should have XLnown what he was about, resides in Nottinghamplace. He had in his service as butler from November 6, 1855, to April 1, 1850, one JAMES :PARxEFn. When PAlRXE2 was about to leave his service at the latter date Mr. SUADWELL 'went over the plate with him, and found that articles were wanting to the value of 171. 10s. Mr. SHIADWELL refused to pay the man the balance of his wages, amounting to 61. 10s. After various discussions, one of which took place at the station-house in the presence of the sergeant, MIr. SHADWELL offered to compromise the felony,and not press the criminal charge, if 1ll. were handed to him. PARnER'S wife paid to Mr. SHADWELL 51. outside the station-house door, and subsequently borrowed 31., which she also gave to him. These two sunms, together with the balance due on the w.ages, brought up the ainount to 171. 10s., the value of the missing plate. In the course of his 'cross-examination Mr. SHAD WELL was asked when he first believed the man was guilty of felony. His reply we give verbatim .-." On the 2d 4o of April I had consulted the inspector. I ss am certain he stole the plate now, and I w' was quite certain when I took the money. I " beliecd him to be a felon. I gave him a cha4' racter." Now, it is not to the question of 'compromising the felony to which we would now 'call attention, but how is it that Mr. SHADWELL believed the man to be a felon, and yet stave him a cLaracter ?
This case J, we believe, a remarkable one, though it totes but illustrate in a somewhat stronger way than usual the evil custom which prevails among employers with re'erence to the 'characters of aervants. Let us at least be true -to each other. Good servants will gain as much. as we shall in the end by our rigid adherencoe -to truth in so Important a particular.

The following is a translation of the article in the Monifew,u of which a telegraphic ummary appeared in our second edition yesterday:-
"The Government of the Emperor has always been inspired by a twofold denire in the affairs of the East. If it had in view, in a general interest of policy, at the same time French as well as European, to assure the independence and maintonance of the Ottoman empire, it was also one of its no Iess constant cares to seek the improvement of the condition of the Christian populations dependent upon the sovereignty or the suzerainty of the Sultan. It cousiders it one of the happiest results of its policy and of the efforts of its arms to have contributed to ameliorate the condition of those numerous populations by procuring for them an equality of rights and the advantages of religious liberty.
" The Government of the Emperor was the more inclined to follow this conduct, as it was convinced that it thereby served at the samie time the cause of humanity and of civilization, and seconded the enlightened and benevolent intentions of the Ottoman Government.
"A Among these Christian populations, those of Servia, of Wallachia, and of Moldavia -were peculiarly situated. Possessing their own institutions, they enjoyed ancient rights and privileges; all that was needed, therefore, was to assure to them those advantages by placing them under the guarantee of European law, and by dravwing therefrom new elements of ordor and of prosperity for the country. It was in taking this point of view that the Congress of Paris decided that the Moldo-Wallachian PrinoipaUties should be called upon to appoint two assemblies, or Divans ad thoc, 'with the special mission of expressing the wishes of those provinces, and of indicating the modifications that 'would best suit their organization.
" The union of Moldavia and Wallachia under one and the same admninistration do ubtless holds the first place in these eventual modifications. The Government of the Emperor took advantage of the natural opportunity offered by the Congress of Paris to pronounce itself formally in favour of that combination.
" Already at the Vienna Conferences the Plenipotentiary of France had expressed the opinion that the union was the combination best suited to assure to Moldavia and Wallachia the strength and consistency necessary to make them on that side a useful bulwark for the inde. pendence of the Ottoman territory. The Government of the Emperor had then, from the very first, clearly expressed its view of this important question. It has not ceased to profess it, and the exchange of communications which took place recently between it and the Cabinets 'which entertain a different opinion as regards the measures to be taken at Constantinople for the convocation of the Divans has only strengthened its convictions. It does not despair of seelng them prevail in the councils of the Powers, for it seems to it difficult that the one of them all which is most directly interested in the question should not recognize, when the day for a serious deliberation shall have arrived, that the union of the Principalities which would be for it an additional pledge of security and external independence, and for the populations a fruitful element of prosperity, does not imply anything which is not completely in accordance with the rights of suzerainty actually exercised by the Sublime Porte waith regard to the Danubian provinces."
A letter from Madrid of the 30th ult. says
" The Absolutist party is organizing, and preparing itself for the approaching elections. For the first time since the death of Ferdinand VII. this party manifests its resolution to join in the Parliamentary struggle, in the hope by this means of destroying constitutional government. Its organs in the press form a committee which directs its organization; it declares that the candidates of the Government must be supported. The situation of the Government, composed as it is in great part of men professing constitutionalism, is anomalous in the extreme; it is driven, in spite of itself, h give strength to the Absolutists; it is compelled to foUow a policy which is hostile to its existence.
" With this activity of the Absolutists coincides the amnesty granted to the half-Carlist, half-brigand band, who have so long infested the country under the orders of the Hierros. The offlcial journals were long used to call these men robbers and bandits, and yet they have been permitted to walk about the streets of Burgos dressed in their uni. forms, and displaying the distinctive signs of their rank in the service of Don Carl os; and they have been received by the authorities with marks of deference. The Absolutist journals speak of them with much respect, and, indeed, as their political friends. These persons have claimed the amnesty in pursuance of orders emanating from the Carlist Central Committee,whose representatives are not far distant from the spot where this letter is vritten.
" An amnesty will probably be granted also to Cabrera and other notorious chiefs; and it has even become a serious question among the Carlists whether it would not be pruxdent to elect Cabrera Deputy for his native town, Tortosa; or, stIl better, to insist upon the Government naming him Senator, though it is hardly thought that the Carlist chie will come to tadrid until the prospects are stillmore in favour of his cause than at present.
"The visit of the Court to Seville and the other pro. vinces of Andalusia has not been abandoned; it will pro. bably take place in the beginning of March. The night be. fore last the aides-de-camp who are to accompany the Eing were chosen by lot. The affair of General Prim is proceeding. The object of the Government clearly is that he should not be elected deputy for Catalonia. General Zabala, late Minister of Foreign Affairs, is charged with his defence.
" A meeting of Progresistas, who were members of the Constituent Assembly, his been held at the house of 31. 010oaga. It was agreed that the Liberal party should take part in the elections. The idea of abstaining is now in the minds of few. Every one adtmits the difliculties that are in their way, since the Government has resolved that the electoral lists adopted in 1851 by the Sartorius Government are those that will be used on the present occasion, and that from these lists the greater part of the Liberals are excluded. There ex;sts, moreover, a Royal order of a most despotic nature, in virtue of which the Governors of provinces are authorized to arrest, or chang, the domicile of, those persons who may seem to them to be dangerous, It is superfluous to point out the real object of thi order. The Governors understand it perfectly, and they have already commenced removing persons who were candidates to the Cortes. In this situation are, for instance, Generals Latorre, Serrano Bedoya, and several others, who have been removed from the places they were residing in simply because they were coming forward as candidates. Such is the personal liberty which the Governnient promises to the electoral body and to the candidates! All these difficulties were duly considered at the meeting at hL Olozaga's. Nevertheless, it has been resolved to take part in the contest, if it be only to show that the Liberal party prefers legality to foroe. A central committee has
een named, with M. Olozaga for President, and on him now depend the hopes of the Liberal party in Spain."
The Ministerial evening paper states, that the merchants of Canton had presented an address to Admiral Guerin, who commands the French squadron in the Chiina Seas, and whose flag is hoisted in the Virginie, thanking him for the services rendered by him and the officers and seamen under his orders to the foreigners in Canton during the late events, in saving lives, preserving merchandise, and extinguishing the fires in the factories, The persons who ssgned the address notice the fact that, during their stay in those vwaters, the French seamen have acquired the universal and justly-deserved good w,ishes of the inhabitants of the surrounding continent.
The Pays announces that another collision has taken place on the frontiers of Persia between the Russians and the Ttrcomati tribes. In virtue of a convention signed between Russia and Persia in the year 1846 the Russians constructed the fortress of Petrowsky on the Caspian Sea, near Astrabad. The commander of the fort, in order to protect the garrison from a surprise, lately erected two exterior works communicating with the fort. These works ha* scarcely been finished wlhen, on the 11th of
Januarylast,the Turcomans, profiting bya dense:fog,
fell suddenly on the Russians and forced them to fall. back on the fortresawirh aslightloss. The Governor, having placed th4 garrison inder arms, sallied out with a strong forc0,ad held in checkthe Turcomans, who had already begun to demolish the 'works; and he, at the same time, demanded assistance of the Governor of Ashoorada, which was immediately sent to him. The Russians then pursued the Turcomans, killed some, and took more prisoners, among whom was a chief of the principal tribe of pirates in the Mazandaran, who was imniediately sent to, -the Governor-General -at Astrakhan. The Russians by waging an implacable war against the Turcomau robbers have rendered some service to the merchants trading in those countries. - - 'r

VIENT4A, FEB. 1.
As great reforms are to be made in the administration of the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom, the Central Congregations have been desired to point
out to the Imperial Government those changes which| may to them appear necessary or desirable. The Cabinet is firmly resolved to maintain the principle of the unity and indivisibility of the empire, but it has become evident to all its members that greater allowa-nce must in future be made for the peculiarities of the different nationalities. The attempt " to Germanize" the Italians, Magyars, and Slaves is a political blunder, and the Minister of the Interior wil assuredly meet with less systematic opposition to his measures when he ceases to endeavour to force German customs and the German languase on the other nationalities. The improvements in the administration of the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom are to be made without delay, so that the Archduke Ferdinand Max will find the state machine in good working order when he enters on his duties as Governor-General. The appointment of the Archduke has not yet been made public, but it is known in official circles that the nece-sary preparations for his definitive establishment at Milan are being made; Yesterday evening a courier was sent to the capital of Lombardy with a vast quantity of State papers, and it is presumed that some matters of importance will be settled before the Emgeror and his three Ministers return to this city. Since His Majesty has been in Italy the draught of the municipal laws has been forwarded to him, but reliable information has been given me that it will undergo some very important alterations before it receives his sanction. The statutes for the representation of the different provinces are reposing quietly in the bureaux of the Home Depart
ment, and there they are likely to remain for a time, as the Minister has lost courage, so often have his propositions been rejected by the Council of the Empire. It may be remarked, that rather more than five years have elapsed since His Majesty the Emperor issued a rescript, in which it was said that as soon as the political organization of the empire was completed the several provinces should have a kind of representation. Until now the only provinces which had representatives were Venice and Lombardy. One of the most important changes in the military organization is, that the bookkeeping office of the War Department will no longer be subject to the " General Direction of Accounts" (General Rechnungs Directorium). The accounts of the War Department are in future to be kept by the Supreme Army Commando, and consequently the Finance Minister will have little or no control over the expenditure of the War Department. His Majesty the Emperor is so well satisfied with General Baron SBhlitter, the person who made the draug,ht of the new military oranization, that he has given him the Commander's Cross of St. Stephen, w hich is the first of Austriant cviiE orders.
Some time since the Sardinian papers announced that the Turin Cabinet did not intend to send any one to congratulate the Emperor on his arival in his Italian states "unti the Sequestration had been raised and a general amnesty granted." Both measures have been carried out, but the Sardiniaus would deceive themselves if they fancied their menace had any influence on the policy of the Imperial Government. The abolition of the sequestration and the liberation of the political prisoners were resolved on fully two months before the Emperor quitted this city, and the feact is just as well known to the French s-ad Eng,lish Governments as it is to His Majesty's Ministts Orders have been given by the IEmperor that the celebrated " Last Supper," by Paul Veronese, which is in the municipal museum at Vice=za, shall be restored. As the delieate job ic to be done under the superintendence of the Acadic n, of the Fine Arta at Venice, it is not to be feared:
any damage will happen to thoe pats of th pie: d which are still uninjured. My rneawing is, thar " La Cena " is not likely to be weo - d to death. Nothing positive is yet k- .wn rempeat;iig the reduction of the army, but the prevalent report in military circles is, that 60, 000 men will be sent to their homes, and some 25,000 horses sold. Towards 9 o'clock in the - -ing of the 25th their Majesties drove in a carriag.- uid pair, without any outriders or guards, to the Scala; but they were a long time in getting there, as a dense crowd surrounded the vehicle and insisted on drawing it. As the Emperor declined the proffered honour, the horses were led by the people to the theatre, " amid thunders of applause." A Milan correspondent of the Augsburg Gazette observes that a hundred thousand Austrian bayonets could hardly inflict greater injury on the enemies of Austria than the clemency of the Emperor has done. At the battue at Monza a vast quantity of game was killed, and 104 head were shot by His Majesty. About a fortnight ago five or six of the Archdukes went to shoot wild boars on one of the Imperial estates, and lilled no fewer than 173. There can be no mistake about the number, as the game killed in the various Imperial preserves is regularly entered in the books of the Oberstjager-
Ieister (Master of the Woods and Forests), who sells it wholesale to the game-dealers. It is stated. that a fort is to be constructed on the Semmerins, which will command the approaches to the railroad
TREATY FOP. THE REDEMPTION OF TItE
SOUiND DUES.
The following is, aswe learn from advices received from Denmark, the outline of the treaty about-to be concluded between Denmark and the various European Powers trading with the Baltic for the redemption of the Sound Dues:-
The preamble states, that with a view to facilitate and increase the commercial and maritime relatons at present existing between Denmark and the other contracting States, these parties have agreed to negotiate a treaty for abolisihin,g the dues levied on ships and their cargoes passing through the Sound and the Belts, and for diminishing the transit
duiy payable on goods passing overaim from the German Ocean to the Batic.
In the first article the King of Denmark undertakes for the fature not to levy any duty under the name of customs or tonnage, or for lighthouses, buoys, &c., on any vessels, or their cargoes passing from the German Ocean to the Baltic, or vie versd
through the Belts or the Sound, and this too irrespectively of whether the vessels simply pass through the Danish waters, or whether they be compelled by stre6s of weather or for the sake of commercial operations to cast anchor there, or to put into a port. No vessel of any sort
belonging to tl -.ontractitg Powers is in future to be subjected to any detention or other hindrance while pasing through the-Delt6 0r the Sound: with regarto the vessels of other States not participating in this treaty, the King of Deunmark is to be at liberty to settle by separate arrangements the fsed conditions that are to be granted to them. !
The King undertakes further to free-fromall dues for lighthouses, beacons, budys, &c., and, in general, from all marilime taxes, writh the exception of
absolute port dues and customs, any such,vesselsof thae contracting parties as may enter or leave 3An'ish;
ports either in cargo or in ballast, and equally whether they have or havo not entered intWany conimercial transaction at those pOrts,
-In the second article the Xing binds himself t;,maintain and keep in good order all the lights, bea-
cons, buoy, &c., at present R us, botWA vit #e aEt
*proaches to Danish pe, and roads, and along the iJanish coast. Secondlly,fn the intereat of conmmerce and navigation, to pay due regard to the expediency of modfying the position or the form of these lights, beacons, buoys, c., or of increasing their number, and this without any charge or burden to forein vessels. Thirdly, to keep up the present Supply of pilot, whom it haU be optional to aU masters of vessels to employ or not. The charges for pilotag are also never to rise higher than the
are at present; they are to be the same for Danish as for foreign vessels, and are to be payable only by those vessels that take pilots on board. Fourthly, he wiU permit private persons, whether natives or foreigners, to establish stations in the Sound and Belts for providing steam tugs to vessels pa3sing through and desirous of profiting by this faclity. Fifthly, he extends to all canuls or other routes leading from the German Ocean to the Baltic the same exemption from duty which Danish and foreign merchandise of certain kinds enjoys on certain routes (herefollows a specification of the various kinds of merchandise and the various routes); and if in future anygoods notspecifiedhereshould succeed m obtaining an exemption from transit duty on any one of these routes, that exemption shaUl be extended to allothers. And, sixthly,hemundertakestoreduce the rate of tiransit duty on all those goods now liable to it to an uniform rate of 16 skilings Danish money for 5001b. Danish weight; and, finally, should the transit dues at ..any future time be lowered on ang one of the routes below this rate, the King undertakses to put all the routes now connecting, or which may hereafter connect, the German Ocean or the Elbe with the Baltis or any of its tributaries, on a footingof perfect equality with any routes that may hereafter be opened between any two ports of his dominions.
According to Art. 3, the provisions of Articles 1 and'2 are-to come into force on and after April the 1st of this year.
Art. 4 binds the States entering into this tteaty with Denmark to pay the latter as an indemnification for the sacrifices it makes in the above respects the sum of 30,570,698 rixdollars, according to various quotas already agreed upon, and with the provision that each State is liable only for its own quota.
In Art. 5 it is provided that the various amounts above specified shal be paid within 20 years, in 40 half-yearly equal instalments, which shall include the portion of the capital due and the interest that may accrue on the outstanding balance.
Each of the high contracting parties undertakes in Artidcle 6 to come to an agreement with the King of Denmark as to-I, the manner how, and the place where, these half-yearly payments shall be made; 2, the manner and the rate in which the several amounts, as stated in Danish money, shall be computed in the money of the said State; and, 3, the conditions and the manner in which the said State reserves to itself (if at all) to pay off by anticipation its quota of the indemnity money.

Meeting Of Convocation.
MBETING OF COfO0ATION.
Yesterday the meeting of the tipper House was of a merely formal character, and was immediately adjourned by the ost Rev. President till thls morning, when it meets for the disposal of business.
TEI Lowym Housz
assembled in the eriusalem Chamber. In additio to those whom we mentioned as present yesterday there were also Dr. Coleridge, proctor to the cler of Exeter, and the Rev. Mlr. Mills, proctor to the clergy of Suffolc.
The proceedings were opened with the usnal prayers, and the names having been called over, and the prefatory routine business, which occupied a considerable time, transacted,
The Rev. H. W. 3mizE presented two petitions, signed by 44 clergy of the rural deaneries of Newlbury and 3laidenhead, against the present indiscriminate use of the burial serviee, which were read and referred to the Commnittee of Gravamina.
Notices of motion and amendments wero then given by the Rev. Mr. JdASSNGrrEPJ), the Iev. Canon SELWYN, the Venerable Arocdeacon Dmuisox, and the Venerable Archdeacon RAIiD,LL, and a committeo formally appointed to confer with the Upper Home on the subject of churchrates was again reappointed.
The PROLOCUTOR said such a number of notices of motion and amendment had been given having reference to the subject of the adjourned debate on Church discipline that he was really quite at sea among theti alL He therefore begged that each amendment might be taken in the order of time, and tbat each member w-ho had spok-n on the general question would endeavour now to confine himself as much as possible to thsuboect of t'he armendment which he
The adjourned debate on the Ron. and Rev. S. Best's amedndment to Archdeacon Randallrs resolution was then resuedby reading tho original moton and amendment.
The first was given atlength in our report of yesterday, and the amendment merely proposed to omit that the Judicial
Committee should refer questions of doctrine to a council composed of the archbishops and bishops of the Established
The Ron. and Rev. S. BEsT said he felt it his duty to press his motion, as lie believed it would prove the best which, the House could adopt. He wss willing that the final court of appeal should be the Judicial Committee of the Privy COUciL if nO person not a member of the Established Church sat at it. He did not move the omission of the second clause of the regolution from any diswpect to the bishope, but from a wish to save them from ths anxiety anD distress which must result from their being called upon to decide much-disputed questions of doctrine. He thought, also. his proposition had the advantage of being prscticil, which was not the case with the elaborate theories which sought to trace down the authority of the Church from the fourth century of Christianity.
Dr. M'CAtTL willingly seconded tho amendment, for he felt the utmost confidence in the lawyers who composed, or were likely to wcmpose, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council-not even excepting those who were not mem rs of the Church of England. The'doctrines of that Church were settled, and the only question, therefore, which would remain for the lawyers of the Judicial Comnmittee to decide was whether a clerk had or had not spoken according to those doctrines. He was quite satisfiedwith the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as it now
Stood.
Dr. JEnr quite agreed that the Judicial Committee contbned moet valuable elements, but for many reasons he could not agree to its being constituted the final court of ap aL He therefore opposed the amendment.
oe PROLOCUTOP then put the amendment, which was negatived without a division.
The Rev. H. Cox proposed his amendment to the effect that the Lower House was not prepared to submit, without further deliberation, any mrther scheme to the House of Bishops in accordance with their Lordships' suggestions. Mr. Cox briefly supported it, on the ground that it was quite evident, from the number and conflicting nature of the amendments and resolutions, that that House was not ready to submit any practical scheme.
The amendment was seconded, but on being put by the Prolocutor, was immediately negatived.
Tho Rev. Canon SELwYN then gavo notice of his intention to propose a resolution to the effect that the Lower House, having taken into consideration the question of a court of final appeal in matters of doctrine and finding a difficulty in arring at any satisfactory solution, request the Upper House to agree to the appointment of a joint committee of both Houses to consider the subject.
The Rev. Mr. MILD1inLrY econded the amendment, which led to a prolonged discussion as to wlbether it should be debated at onceo or come in the oreer of time at a later period of the day, when other amendments had been canvased.
The question was at length decided in favour of its immediate consideration, and
Archdeacon DtNIsoi opposed the suggestion. This was no time for the Church to move in the question of a court of final appeat iun matters of doctrine. Neither that House nor a committee of both Houses, nor any of the clergy, were in a position to consider the subjoet. At most, tho joint committee could only lay its recommendation before Her Ma%ety's Government, and it was almost erring on theside of ope to suppose that the Government would pay any great attention to their suggestion on the matter. He entreated the House to pause, for to sit still was now their safest course. Let them adhere timply to the report which they had p resented to the Upper House on the subject in
1 , and whih pledged themtnoparticularline of action. They were safe where they were;* the danger was in making a change, and therefore he opposed the rev. canon's
Archdeacon HAnRiSON opposed the amendment. Their deliberations had already showrn theodifficulties attending the discussion of details. It was competent for the Upper House to propose a joint committee. Their best eourse was to adhere to the "eneral principles of the rop4rt of 185o.
Archdeacon THonrz alo opposed the amendment, believing that if it werecarriedthe House might be preventedtaking into consideration many important matters contained in the report.
The amendment was then put and negatived.
After some conversation on the subject of an amendment proposed by the Rev. Mr. FxNDALL, but which was ultimately withdrawn,
Archdeacon Dm;usox; moved the following amendment:"That this Housedesires reapectfully to state to hts Gmea the Presidec,t that it baa at preasent no suggtstion to offer with sespect to the oonsiltution of acoDurt of finala ailon questlons of doetrlno. beyond these aalready made under h i.t- rprto h oe House of I nteprte h oe This was the only cours they could consistently take, while it waprfectly respectful to his Grace to inform him that they adhered to the principles they had on a former occasion deliberately adoptd
Archdeacon OTvrn seconded the amendment. From the gret variety of opinions entertained by the membors of that House it was impossible they coald come to any conclusion upon the subject. It would be better therefore to leave the other House to take the initiative.
Alter a brief discussion the House divided, when the numbers were,-
Noes ... ... ... 2.. ,. 24 Ayes .. ... ... ... 21 The amendment was therefore negatived.
Archdeacon HARBIsox then moved the following amendment:

Archdeacon DENISON seconded the amendment.
The question was pat, and the amendment, on a show of hand4 was carried.
The effect of this decision was to dispose of Archdeacon Randall's motion, and terminato the discussion of the question altogether.
ECCLE:SIASTI-IOL SYNtODS,
The Rev. Canon SZnMOUR then rose to bring forwavrd a motion on the-subject of the present constitution of ecclesiastical synods, and the object of which was to secure the counsel and co-operation of the faithful laity in the proieedinns of Convocation. He observed that the anostolic counci vas the first of the long series of councils and synods of wbich they read in ecclesiastical history. That council was the origin, as it was the justification, of them all. It was to the councils of the Church that they owed true Catholic and apostolic teaching.
Archdeacon DENIsoN rose to order. It was only very lately that the House had, in conjunction with the Upper House, addressed the Crown for permission to extend, modify, and amend the constitution of the Lower House of Convocation in respect to its spiritual element, and that was the only element of which it was composed. The Crown, acting under the advice of its Ministers, did not see fit to permit such an amendment to be even taken into consideration. He therefore wished to ask the Prolocttor whether it was competent for that House, without the e mison of the Crown, to entertain any proposition whi
had for iti object an entire alteration of the constitntion of the Lower House of Convocation. He believed it hadnot, tnd that they would incur heavy penalties if they were to entertain any question of the kind, unless they firt obtained the consent of the Crown.
The hRoLOCuToR said he had intended to interfere at a later period because ha thought the motion was not pro. perly worded; but as to the neessity of first obtainin- the consent of the orownhediffered from Archdeaoon Denson. Hothon though theyd a perfct right to address the Crown upon anysubject which they had not been forbidden to do. TeCrow nalllowed them to sit, and, if so, it must alow them to do all things which it was not illegal for them to do; and he wtas not aware that thete was anyhing illegal in thhe befotien tbeflor6eteHue
The Rev. Canon SSvsiouu proceeded. Ie assumed that the synodal action of the Church was an ordinance of God, and recogniz6d in the 15'h chapter of the Acts of the Apostes. e admitted thattoquestionofChurch vrn. ruentwa involved in the propo itions he as au Itoto submit to the Houe, and in order to come to a riht jud' . mnentgtheyougt to inquire w ether Godbad revealed to HIS Church any grea t and primary la so as to invest that Church with authority throughout all ages. He thought they had sueh a revelation in the commnission which the Lord gs.ve to His e.peetles immseiaWily, befo-re Ili$ wsent. He chargoid them to teach and"baptize,. and He promised to be with them anid (as 'implied) with all 'who should afterwards hold the apostolic office to the'enid' of the world. That commission extefnde,to the bishops of jhe Church, who wore 'in 'a isense in which to other~ men. wore, the successors of htelpotles, staldi nremay in thee Church.

Subequenty theytookthe brethren also itothe=rcoundigs; and the postles did not send forth their del.`M utitlithey huid reeived the assent of the brethren. Th. Mev gentleman proceeded to quote authorities to show if $sihi3s the practice of the Church in earl ges. The mJuaM Of rgnatius was tbat nothing should aeone by the Chuifr.i without the bishop- while the maxim of Bt. Cjprian wE that nothing should Le done without the concurrenoe of the' presbytery and the peoyle. But, without relying on precedent, he went to a higher source. If the Lord *ava the power of government to the apostles, and if, in. the exercise of their Autthority, they called the presbyters to their council, he imagined that the bishops of the Church, by the leItimate exercise of the same authority, might at an e ca in laymen to give them a place in thee ynod they believed that such an act would be for the good of the Church. The only thing they ought to guard igainst doing was to put their own supremacy and power of control in
jeopa=. He could not conceive how that could ever happen while the hi,ho1ss sat togetber in a separate- room, without the influence or control of the presbytcrs or the people. If it were objected that such an act on the part of the bishops would not be merely a reconstitution of the synod of the Churchl, but sgreat innovation and revolution, he would venture to remind the House of thepeculiar character of their convocation. For 12 centuries the bishops and, their presbyters sat in one cbamber. Those presbvters were chosen by tho bishops themselves, and with ihem confirmed their decrees. But now the bishops sat In one chamber and the presbyters in another; but the presbyters had not their laymen to confirm their decrees. It lnigfit be apprehended that men who were not friendg of the C urch mxight gain admission to the synod; but he believed that none but honest Churchmen would enter it. Again, it was said that if they admitted laymen they would take part in discussions on the doctrines of the Church, which would be contrary to al propriety and ancient practice and be sufficient to upset the eupremacy. The might ii the psed, reserve matters of doctrine for the bishops, but he thought they had better admit the laity without such reservation. Why should they fear the presence and influence of the laity in the discussion of matters affecting the doctrines of the Church? He did not believe that laymen were, vne; rally, less sound in their faith than themselves. that would be their position? They would be able to take counsel from the prebyters, but thev could confirm nothing without the previous consent of the bishop; and in hos oSMiaon it was impossible to exaggerate the benefit that would a2ise from such counsel between the clergy and laity. The clergy would benefit from the sond sense and wisdom of the lay men on a great variet7 of subjects, and the laymen -would benefit by denving from the clergy sounder views on the subjects of the doctrine, discipline, and ritual of the Church. It wassaidthatthelaity were already represented in Parliament, and that to admit thenm in the convocation would be to alter the constitution,ran endanger the union between Church and State. Now, he wished to speak of Parliament with that respect which wag due to so important a portion of the Legislature, but he could not unierstand how any mtan could say that Parliament at present represented the faithful laity of the Church of England. It was not true; and many of its members would repudiate such an slUegation, and would avow themselves the opponents of the Church, and aeknowledge that they desired her destruction, or rather such changes in her doctrines sand discipline as would ineffect be her destruction. Thirty years ago, when Parliament consisted of members of the Church only, it might be said that it represented the laity of the Church but vhen the constitution of Parliament was changee by the admission of Roman Catholics into it that could no longer be alleged. Indeed, he conceived that the change so effected had rendered a readjustment in the Church itse'lf necessary, in order to compensate for the Immense loss which the Church ustained by that important alteration of the constitution. (Hear.) te was not forgettingthe supromacyof theCrown, nor did heforget that that supremacy was so wound up with the Parliament that the Queen could not consent to his proposition without having also the consent of Parliament. He apprehended, if his proposition were carried, Parliament woulld no longer be able tolook with sucpicion at every act of the convocation because it wouldknow thatevery such act would beendorsed by a su9icient! portion of the people to give ssurance that nothing would be done injuriously to affect the laity in their rights and liberties. Then came the objection that it would endanger the union between Church and State. There was a tinie when the State was in dar,ger because the Church was led on by a fereign bishop, and usurped the privileges and poDwer of the State; but, he apprehended, If there were any danger now it lay quite another way, and
the fear was lest the State should usurp the power and the privileges of the Church. The rev. gentleman, after some urther remarirs on the great benefits which he believed would result from the adoption of his proposition, concluded by moving:-

YORK
The Convocation of York was held on Wednesday at the Chapter-house of York CathedraL The Rev. Canon Harcourt presided as commissioner of the archbishop. The Archdeacons of York and the East Riding, the Rev. Canon Trevor, and a few of the local clergy and laity, were present. The commissioner, archdeaoons, proctors, &c., attended morning prayers at the cathedral, and afterwards proceeded to the chapterhouse. The proceedings commenced by the commissioner stating that
e should be ready to receive any written document whihch any proctor might be desirous of handing in, whereupon the Rev. Canon Trevor prayed that the proctors present mighim be allowed to retire and elect a prolocutor. The commissioner refused the prayer, signifying that he was ready only to receive any written document. The Rev. Canon Trevorthen presented to the commissioner a paper, which set forth the nature of the prayer for the election of a prolocutor. The document was accepted, and the commissioner inquired if any commands had been received from Her Majesty to proceed to buiness. Having received an answer in the negative, the commissioner at once formallyprorogued the meeting of Convocation to the 31st of March next.

Alderman Goodwin, late mayor, opposed the motion altogether, declaring that an income-tax wns necessary to the caing out of free trade. It reductions were needed in taxation he considered they ought rather to be made in the indirect taxation of the country, which is borne by the industrious classes, than in the direct ta^xation upon. income and property. HAe and other speakers who followed him agreed that incomes below10 150l. ought not to be taxed. After further discussion the resolution was put and carried, and a petition to the lIouse of Comons founded upon iT w,as adopted.
THE BlonAL EFFECT OF THZ RESOLtTE AFFAUt.- The reader wll find a large portion of our space occupied by the details of the reception of the Resolute officers in England. It is doubtful whether any foreigners, whether of kingly or any other rank, have ever been so magnificently entertained or so gracefully complimented by the Government of England as these countrymen of ours From the Queen to the people of Portsmouth every one has viedc with his neighbour in trying to show bow highly he could teatify his gratitude and respect for this country. Nothing h=a been omitted that the heartiest good feeling or the nost; cultivated good taste could sugg,est. With all theirquarrels,. England and the United States are friends at heart. Smallminded peopln in both nations make it their business to, nurse petty spites; hut the large-hearted people of both countries are friends, -allies, and brothers. And this is ncr pohtical alliance. Though the Governzment of England is more like our own, as being freer than any other in Europe, yet tho governing. clams is by no snean& drawn towards the United States. The alliance is purely a popular one rather in contravention of tina ai obedience to tue sentiment of politica leaders. Whien England alies herself with France her people know yery well that it is but a temporary make-shift, a political'e - dientc they explain, they try toexcuse itby saying n.th ; Frenth are at bottom an improv3tg Iple_ -nd that their

In the StockExchange to-day there was a very full demand for money, which was supplied on Government securities at 6iper cent. The discount-market was also active, and the applications at the Bank of England are believed to have been extremely numerous.
Foreign securities were rather heavy, but the operations produced little influence on prices. Turkish, Russian, and Dutch were principally dealt in. Turkish SLx per Cents. were purchased at 93i and a for money, and 93k to J for the account. In the Four per Cents. Guaranteed transactions took placs at 101 for money and the account. Brazilian Five per Cents., 1024; the Four-and-a-half per Cents, Newf, 98; the Five per Cents. NeXw, IOIJ; Seven per Cents. Cuba (Matanza and Sabanilla), 101; Ei.cuador Provisional Land Warrant, 4; Russian Four-and-a-Half perCents., 961 and i; the Small, 97; Sardinian Five per Cents., for money, 90i and 90; for the account, 90; Spanish New Deferred, 23i and 24 ; the Certificates of Coupon, not funded, 6O; Belgian, Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 99; and Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 65i and 65.
The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. 90c. for money, and 68f. 10c. for the end of the month, showiing no alteration beyond a slight increase of heaviness
A further sum of 30,0001. was taken from the Bank to-day for exportation, making a total of 107T,0001. withdrawn during the present week. These continued shipments excite surprise, since they cannot be for fresh purchases of silver, a large sum of 5-franc pieces being already for sale at prices which wrould leave a loss on their importation.
The Bank of England have intimated that they will henceforth, in the case of such of their customers as keep their drawing accounts exclusively withthem, cease to restrict their discount accommodation to bills not having more than three monthstorun. Long bills wil therefore be receivedfromthese parties in the same manner as they are received by private bankers from their customers at such rates as the state of the market may from time to time render expedient.
It is stated that the terms for the arrangement of the debt of Venezuela have been fully agreed upan between the Committee of Spanish Anerican Bondholders and the commissioners from that republic, and that a meeting of the bondholders is to be held on Monday.
At an annual reeting of the London and County Bank, held to-day, Mr. W. Nicol presiding, a dividend of 6 per cent. for the half-year, free from income-tax, was declared, which, with 5 per cent. previously paid for the six rmonths ending the 30th of June, makes a total of 11 per cent. for the year, and the report and accotunts were unanimoutsly adopted. The chairman stated that the capital of the bank, which is now 500,0001., is proposed to be increased in June next in accordance wvith the views of the directors, supported by the opinion of Mr. J. E. Coleman, the accountant, to 60(,0001., by an issue of 5,000 shares of the nominal amount of 201. at a nmean price; so that vwhile the proprietors participate in the premium, an equal sum may be carried to the reserve fund. The policy of increasing this fund in proportion to the amount of liability having been advocated, the limitation placed on the total at the last annual meeting has been witlhdrawn. With regard to the general state of business, it was mentioned that through the alarm created by the failure of the Royal British Bank, the current balances (principally deposit accounts) were, on the 31st of December, reduced by about 600,0001. Since that period there has been a recovery of about 250,000., and an increase of business in other respects. At the time when the greatest anxiety prevailed the directors, in order to place themselves in a position of strength, sold securities, on which there was a trifling loss, but they gave instructions to the whole of the managers to meet every demand with promptitude, and, in cases where notice was required for withidrawing moneys, to anticipate it by immediate payment. With respect to the advances of the bank on special securities, which include the property of the late wJohn Satheir and the Westminster Improvement Estate, the directors add that they are taking the necessary measures for their realization. The Irish estates have not get been sold, but it is thought by Midsummer the necesssary steps will have been comcleted. The other items of the account are being nlisposed of; 4,000l. has already been received, wsile the remaining 12,0s01. or 14,0001. wlill be obtained before the end of the month. In the case of the Westminster Improvement property steps haven been taken to make alterations in some of the prehises, wohich, as they are now letting, vill, it is considered, expedite their sale. In answser to questions, it wnas stated that the total claim under the Sadleir account is 112,3001., and that the value of the Irish estates is estimated to cover any deficieacy. Votes of confidence waere unanimously passed to the directors and managers. Annrexed is an abstract of the report and accounts:-
dIt will be shown by the balance-sheet, signed by the auditor3, o ad certied by Mr. Coleman, public accountant
tht thegross proFU of the bank for the last half-year in. eluGdig balances amounting to 20,9991. brought for;vard from the last account, asu afteremaling protvisionafor bad and doubtful debts, amounts to 119,2671., leaving after deductions of all expenses, interest, and rebate, a net profit of pre0vu. From.this suns the directors recommend that a dividend be now declared of 6per cent, for the half-year free of income-tax, whic, with the 5 per cent, previously paid for the six months ending the 30th of June last, will bell per cent, for the ear 1856. The directors likewvise recommend that an addition of 5001. be now made to the ' Provident Fund' of the bank for the year 1856, being the same in amount as the sum granted with this object for the previous year. Should these recommendations ba adoptel, there will remaina balance of 7,79SI. to be carried to proSt and lossnewv accOunat. As sutggested at the meetiog of the proprietors in Augus last, the directors further recomnmend that the limitation placed on the reserve funl at the last annual meeting be removed.

At a meeting of the Eledtric Telegraph Company t-day, Mr. G. P. Bidder in the chair, the report apd aPoOunts, toggether with dividend, at the rate of 3iperoent. for the half-year were proposed, but an amendment was submitted declaring the atate.
onent of the directors mneagre and unsatisfactory. A movement promoted by shareholdera in Manchester occasione& a lengthened discussion, mad, notwithstanding elaborate explanations on the part of the chairman, it was contended that the company with better management would pay a higher rate of dividend. At the conclusion of the proceedings the amendment was declared negatived, but a ballot was demanded, the result of which will be annonnced to-morrow.
A sale has been announced for to-morrow at the Commercial Sale Rooms of some samples of nevw East India fibres imported by the EastIndia Company with the view of ascertaining the adaptability of these products to supply the wants of papennakers and others. The company some time back instructed their officers at different stations to send respectively a few tons of such fibres as their districts might furnish, and it is said that some of those already received are likely to prove of greit value whenever they shall be brought here in sullicient quantities to induce manufacturers to arrange for the use of them.
Ameeting. is about tobe held of persons interested in engineering science in conxiexion with a proposal to establish a company for carrying out a patent of Messrs. Wethered Brothers, of Baltimore, for reducing the consumption of fuel in steam engines by mixing common steam with superheated, either before or when it reaches the cylinder. The saving is alleged to be more than 30 per cent., and a report made to the Admniralty has been published1 in which that result appears to have been attained in a trial made some months back on board Her Majesty's steamer Dee.
An Auctioneers and Land Agents' Exchange has just been formed in London to facilitate the transactions of that branch of business by a perfect system of registration of properties for se and investments waanted, as well as to add to the standing of the persons engaged in it by excluding from the advantages of the instituition all those who may have acted unprofesaionally or forfeited a character for respectability and probity. The members must be either land agents, auctioneers, or estate agents, and they are to be subject to the rules and regulations of the committee in a manner analogous to that at the Stock Exchange.
The following remarks by Messrs. Cattley and Co., of St. Petersburg, on the expected supplies of Russian produce during the coming season is from a circular forwarded by Messrs. Robinson and Fleming :-
" As regards expected supplies It is Smposible to get posi. tive information; we state the opinion formed on this point without vouching for its accuracy.
"of the quality of the new goods we have various reports. Tallow will probably be much the same as last year. The new hemp by the barks (growth of 1855) will be very good; the Mejouy, or growth of 1856, is said to be of fair qualty, but of short harle. The new flax is stated to boof inferior quality to that of last year's supply. Of linseed we have seen few really fine samples hitlerto the early setting in of frost prevented its ripening, and the bulk of the new supply will be deficient in weight and of bad colour. Of the lower descriptions of seed, such as Rjeffky, &c., there will be an unusally smaU quantity this year. The new wheat is said to be very inferior, bothi in quality and condition to that shipped in 1856.
" Oar export market has been quiet for some weeks past, but now shows symptoms of more animation, particularly as regards linseed aud gain."

STATAK OF TRADE.
NOTTINGHAM, FEB. 5.
The lace trade has improved a shade, still the market is by no means active. The period of the year has nearly arrived when business begins to be brisk, and, notwithstaud. ing the dearness of material, manufacturers express themselves with confidence with respect to a good spring trade In silk laces there is still very little doing.
The hosiery trade is buoyant. There has for some time been an exceUent demand for hosiery, and more remunerative prices are being obtained by the manufactuirerm The framework knitting operatives are well employed, at good wages.
Silks and yarns have still an upward tendency.
LEICESTER~, FmB. 5.
The hosiery t-ade is dull, the demand for goods being almost, if not altogether, limited to actual requwrements. the operati7es are consequently badly employed. Worsted yarns have still an upw ard tendency, and manufacturers compl3in of a non-remunerative price for their goods,

The prelates of His Holinese's sute placed themselves round the room, and received what was borne to them from the Pope's table.

* The directors of this company have determined to recommend to the proprietors the declaration of a dividend fcr the hialf-year ending the 31Sit of December, 1856, at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum, carring forwrard a balance forthe current half-year of about 17,000u.
OXFORD, WORCESTER, AND WOLVERHAMPTON.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yesterday at Worcester, Mr. W. Fenton in the chair.
The report and accounts, an abstract of which has appeared in The Times, were taken as read.
The CliAutxL said he believed be might now say that they had laid the foundation of the future permanent pros. perity of the companv. The bills which they had cari*ed through Parliament put off for a considerable time the completion of the broad gauge, which had hung so long as a dead weight round their necks. Since their last meeting the directors had spent much time and labour with a view to increase the traffc and diminiai the expenditure. They had also given considerable attention to the question of finance, and had been enabled to raise money ondebentures At interest in no case exceeding 5 per cent. The
'upital account showed a total sum to be raisod of 4,150,844t, which appeated inconsistent with the hope held out in the report that the railway might be completed for 4.COO,COul. With regard to the liabilities of the company, these were at the commencement of the half.year 231,6027, but they had been reduced at the end of 1856 to 110,856. Among these liabiities, be was happy to1 say, were the solicitors' hills, amounting to 16,000!. Messrs. Burchell and Parson had displsayed great forbearanee, tand they haa been enabled to discoarge-their hecaont by the issue of the 4i debenture stock.. TheX hd also dichured their long. standiiig debt to Mr. Vrow er, the engineer, Whoseclaim was about 9,000L, biut throngh the intervention of a friend Mr. Fowler bId consented to- accept 6, 000 in full discharge. They badalso paid off Mr. Willatms, the former contractor for working the line. Since the beiinning of the present ,ear they had beeu enabled to educe thei liabilities fron 110,854)!. to 63,700.

Eailway bah- bee- Unsatictory. Thedirectorsof-this company had gone to that interview degirous of making an amicable rrangement if possible; but he was sorry to addthat they left the room with a strong feeling that there was no desire whatever of cultivating the, same amicable ar. rangement on the part of the Great Western Company. Notwithstanding this, however, the policy of the Oxford, Worcester, and Wolverhampton directors would continue to be a policy of peace, and they were ready as ever to hold out to the Great Western Company the right hand of fellowship. for of this they were assured, that there was more to be obtained by peace than by war. (Cheers.) There was an item of 3,154. which the Great Western Comp any owed this company for money received by them at theirend of the line, and of which they could mot obtain payment, although repeated application had been made for tbat purpose. There was a branchline proposed to bemadebyasep%. rate company from Hampton toStratford-on-Avon, which, if carried out, would materially interfere with this company's traffic on the Stratford Canal, and it would be necessary to oppose that bill in Parliament. Re congratulated themeeting on the presence araong them of several directors of theWorcester and Hereford Railway Company. That line, when completed, would be of the utmost value to the Oxford and. Worcester Company, and it was a fact that coke had been sent from South Wales to Worcester by a detourof 40 miles, vid Shrewsbury. This showed the value of a direct line of communication, which he hoped would soon be accomplished. The new arrangement ef publishing a fortnightly statemnent of the expenditure of the company, he thought,
was advantageous, as aflording information to the sbareholders as a spur to the offioers, and a check upon extravagant expenditure. The Severn Valley Railway was anotber undertaking which it would be to the interests of this company to support, and the directors proposed asking this meeting for power to enter into working arrangements with that company. That company wished the Oxford company to work their line, but he (the chauiran) did notpropoe to commit the company to any definite agreement, but would ask for powers to make an arrangement, which being granted, they would report the result hereafter. In conclusion, he moved the adoption of the report.
This having been seconded, a short discussion ensued.
Mr. BRnwxN asked whether there was any probability of the 24A miles of single line being converted into a double lne, and read an extract from a return in 2Te 2Time, sbow-
lug that the receipts of the Midland company were 566C per mile, and of the Oxford company 391 Would it not be likely that this company would ho able to attain to the Midland traffie ? In such ease he calculated that, after py
inhgthe preferenlce claims, there would be 22,0001 left to
Tho CoAmR.Anrs fearea he could not hold out any hopo of this, tbough he trusted that before a very long period elapsed they wonud be ale to y all tho preference and debenture interest, and something to the oriinal proprietors. The Great Western at present were expending a great deal of money in gettini traffic from Kidderminster and Stour-
bridge, which ooul not pay them, but injured this cornpany's traffic from the best end of their line.
The report was adopted, and, after further discussion, the dividend And interest as recommended in the report were ordered to be paid.
The CiruIRxAI next moved that the future allowance to tne directors should be reduced from 1,6001 to 1,2001. per annum, and that the latter sum should be divided among their own directors, and not among the Great Western
directors, ho sat at this board. The chairman thoughtthe
directors ought to be recompensed by those who elected them. (Cheers.)
Sir IL PETo econded the resolution, which was carried unanimously.
Resolutions were also passed, altering the time for holdin
the future meetinga of the company, which are to be held
benceforth between the 15th of January and the 16th of February, and between the 15th of July and the 15th of August. The directors were empowered to enter into an arrangement with the Severn Valley Railway as asked for,
and the retiring directors, Sir Morton Peto and Mr. S. Pakington, were re-elected. After two divisons, rr Jackson was elected auditor, in the room of Mr. TamlTn, and after other routine business the meeting broko up.
Soon after the conclusion of the meet' a public dinner was riven to the directors at the G , by the inhabi-
tants of the county of Woreester, at which Sir J S. Pakington, MLP., presided.
MANCHESTER, BUXTON, MATLOCK, AND MID-
LAND JUNCTION.
Yesterday the half-yearly mee t of this company was
held at Derby, Sir Joseph Paxtoa, lP., in the chair.
The report of t'e directors stated that the half-year's rent from the lessees, amourting to 5,266., gives the same dividend as on forner occasions,-viz., Is. 4dL per share for the balf-year, which the directors propose to make payable on the 14th inst.
The CHA rpidu, in moving the adoption of the report, stated that the London and North-Western would make a
line to Buxton, and they would make arrangements with them, so that at some future timo th e should be able to connect their line with it. Whenever it was decided to ex-
tend the Matlock line from Rowsley to Whileybridge
there would be a point of junction. TheLondon adNorthWester and Midland Company already leased their line
and said it did not pay - but supposing they had helped to extend it, for the monerate sum of 50001., they would not have lost a farthing upon the Stockport and Whaley-
bridge, while they would have opened up the resources, and conferred a great advantage upon the district.
Mr. TooZAL seonded the adoption of the report, which was carried.
The dividend was declared.
Sir Joseph Paxton and Mr. Gisborme were re-elected
directors. Mr. Richardson was re-elected auditor, and Ur.
Iubbersty appointed an auditor in tho place of Mr. A lleard, deceased.
A vote of thanks was given to the chairman, and the meeting broke up.

Mr. Edward James, Q.C., and Mr. Cross appeared for the plaintiff; And Mr Hoggins, Q.C, and Mr. jyli for the defendant.
The plaintiff in this action, Samuel Horton Beeton, was a printer and publisher in Bonverre.street, Fleet-street, and the defendant, Chariefl HenrY ClArke, was a publisher in Patemnosttr-row.
The action was brougpt on two bills of exchang for 1001. and 75p., payable in fivo and three months, drawn on the 12th of June, 1852, upon the defendant by HenryVizetelly, the publsher, accepted by the defendant, and by Vizetelly enosdt h lmi The defendant denied the endorsement of the bo o s and he also pleaded a special plea, to the effect that the plaintiff and defendant were: in partnership pwith a person nained Salisbury,apubsfr and printers, aud that the co-partnership bought of h Vizttelly his interest in coertain books bid Readable Book " and that H.

who received the sAme as trustee for the said co-part. nershipd and on their joint account; and that there was no consideration for the endorsement, except as afor nid. The defendant also pleaded payment and m, set-off.
The cause was in poe tried yesterday, when the plaintibr proved his case. At the sitting of the Court this mornign the defendant was examined in support of his pleas.
LOrd CASPBELL iummed up the evidence, and left itto thleuy to find their verdict according as they believed the

The jury, after retiring to consider their verdict found
for the plaintiff for the amount daimed, subject to a sment deduction proved by way of set-off.
SPECIAL JURtOSS
When the next special jury cause was called on only three special jurors answered to their names.
Lord CAmPBnl, said je had already in d oeaion to co
plain that such short notice was given to the eial jurors. A reasonable notice ought to be given to them, in order that they might hLake their arrngements.
Sir F. TEhxsioge said he understood the appointments were not made in sfficient tdMe.
Mr. Campbell, the asociate, said the causes 'were not entered in sufficient time.
Lord CA suLL said, the was intorme that the appoint. nents were miade as soon as the causes were entered.

This wa an action of libel, brought by the plaintiff an attorney practising at Margate, aganst t defendant, who is the rector of Ringwrold, near Dover, in Rent, for writin, in ak letter to one William Greenstreet, of and coneerrinw the laitiff tht h was"a ow,pettfogingattorney)1
Mr. erieut Prry nd M. Ilapperedfor tho plain. tiff andMr. . Chmber, Q., an Mr.Badeey for the
It appeared that a person named Stephen Greenstreet had conducted himself violently to his wife and neighbours at Ringwold, and thero was reason to suppose that he was
labouring under some mental malady, and in consequence and to prevent his comtnitting some serious injury the defendant laid an informnation and complaint against him, as did also his wire, before the justices at Dover, that thev went in bodily fear of him. The plaintiff was retained by
Stephen Greenstreet to defend him at the hearing before the mnagistrate,, and succeeded in obtaining l is discharge. The defendant, in a letter written from R WirgwoId Dc r
On the 29th of Mlay, to William Greenstreet, the brother of
Stephen, giving an account of the hearing before the magistrates, wrote-
,I eceived your letter onl yeterday, being tbo day after your

and alrmg eatbouin any , a has o no control weveenretatv himself, I zmuch sar we shall hear or hloodshed before very long "
hi letter, with some other papers, came into the plaintiff's possession on his sending for papers relating to Stephen.
The plaintiff'was very muchannoyed atbeingstl,ld "alow
pttifogn attorney," and on seeing W. Greenstreet at
Iidstono Assizes afterwards, at the Bull Inn, showred the letter to him and others, and said, " What do you think of this? The rev. gentliman calls me a low, pettifogging
attorney," and seemed much annoyed. The letter havinz been putinand proved, the plaintiff was examined, ana stated that he had been 36 years an attorney, and formerly practised in London, and resided on his own freehold; he was engaged much before county courts and justices. He was telegi aphed for to defend Stepben Greenstreet, and had endeavoured to do his duty in defending bim. He had shown the letter to various persons, with the antidote-the expression of his opinion that it was an infamous slander and would come before the public.
For the defendant it was submitted that the letter was a privilged communication. His Lordship overruled this. The loarned counsel then submitted to the jury that the defendaut was acting in the dischargo of his duty and for the best, and stigmatized the action s an attorney's action, brought for costs, and the libel had been circulated only by theplaintiff.
His LoirDssgp in summing up directed the jury that the letter wae not privileged, but was a libel. It was difficult to say what the words meant, but they would be understood
to mean that the plaintiff w as a disreputable practitioner but the words were not circulated by the defendant in a
manner to do mischief. As there was no justification, it was to be regretted that the defendant had gone on to the last extrenne without tendering an apology, which the plain. tiff appeared ready to accept.
The juiy, after a short consideration, found a verdict for the plaintiff.-Damages, 104
FISH V. MACNAAIRA AMD OTHDES.
This was an action to recover damages for an injury received by the plaintiff from the alleged negligence of the defendant's driver.
Mr. Serjeant Byles and Mr. Keene ap red for the plain.
tiff, and Mr. Edvin James, Q.C., Mr. Robinson, an Mr. Wilkinson, for the defendant.
The plaintiff, it appeared, is a publican, and on the 15th
of November last he was driving a pony in a gig down MIortimer-street and into Portland-street, when an omnibus of the defendants ran into him on turning the corner, caught his wheel, ,upset his gig, and throw himi out on the road under the omnibus wheels. The plaintiff sustained very severe injuries by this fall, and haa been put to about 301 expense for medical attendance.
The defendants' case was that the omnibus belonged to the General Omnibus Company, that it was driven by a careful driver, and that as it was being driven after the plaitig's gig the plaintiff, on turner the corner, suddenly pulled up dead, without any warning, and the driver was unable to clear him; and that the plaintiff thus, by his own negligence, contributed to the accdent which folowed.

If the Court were full. there would be a juedicial staff compsetent to the siultltaneo.us discharge of all Its important duties; but, as it is sow constituited, one of those duties raust be abandoned for the present, and as the lesser of two evils, their D,rdahips have given fno the sittings in banco appointed for to-morrow.

This was an action brought against the Sheriff of Kent, ,for allowing one Frederick Thonmas to escape from his custody after he had arrested him, in obedience to two writs 4obtained by the plaintiff
The only question in this case was whether a letter written by the plaintiff's attorney sufficiently authorized the defendant to discharge Frederick Thomas from custody.
A verdict was eventually returned for the defendant. The Court rose at a quarter to 1 o'clock.

It appeared that twv persons named Smith carried on the business of ironmasters at Derby, uinder the name of the Stauton Iron Company. In 1849 the Smiths got into difficulties. They then assigned all their estate to trastees upon trust to carry on the business, and out of the profits to pay the interest on certain mortgages, and to divide the surplus among the creditors signing the deed. Cox and Wheatman had signed the deed. Hickman d plied goods to the company subsequently to ;he deed, an brought his action on bills accepted by the company. It was contended that these parties were creditors, and merely signed the deed as such in order to obtain their proporhon of the surplus profits. The Court of Common Pleas held that the defendants were liable for all acts done by the new company, and therefore were liable upon these bills, and judgment was given for the tPen plaintiff.
There was then an appeal to this Couxt.
v r. Serjeant BYLES and Mdr. WEISBY were heard for the appellants, contending that, by signing the deed the persons o the third part (being the then creditors) did not thereby Adoeme members of the Stanton Iron Company, for the .urpose of being liable as acceptors of bills of exchange fTneyhad signed the deed in order to become entitled to their debts. Inorder to establish a partnership there must be a community of profits.
gMIr. BarZon BR VELL, obsoerved that a bank had recently ~en established, where each depositor was to take an interest varying with the profits of the bank. He knew the best opinions of the bar had been. given that that did not establish a partnership, so as to make the depositors
Mfr. Justice CR0oixrO.-Had not the creditors an interest in the goods ?
IMr. WLsny could not discover it. It was the trade of Smiths, in fact.
* Mr. Justice CBOMPTON.-They shared the profits as long as they permitted the business to be carried on.
: Mr. WrLSBY.-They were merely to have a payment of their debts or so much as the trade would admit. The deed stateqthat as soon as there should be a profit of 1001. it slould be paid into the bank, and as often as there should be enough to pay a shil'-mg in the pound a dividerd to that amount should be decLr and paid among alt the creditors of the company. The parties did not contemplate obtaining any interest in the concern, but signed the deed a creditors only, forbearing to sue for a certain time.
*Mr. Hmn and Mr. Fn=D were heard for the respondents. Who were the Stanton Iron Company, who had accepted these bills ? Where several persons agreed that a business should be carried on, if they were to participate in the profits, that agreement made them partners. In this case here had been an arrangement to carry on the business and fo participate in the profits, and therefore the appellants were lIable as acceptors of the bills of exchange. Profits *ere net or gross; the former was after pment of all expenses, the latter profits without deducting expenses. The deed recited the involvements of Smith, and then they atsigned everything to trustees, to sell so much as was necessary to carry on the busiLess; then to continue the business under the name of the Stanton Iron Company, to procure renewals of leases, out of the gross income to pay the rents, the expenses, and losses and to pay and divide the net income unto and among ail the creditors. Then there wvas a power for the trustees or the creditors to call a meeting of the creditors, who should have power to alter the trusts or to discontinue the business and when tho business was discontinued the trustees were to divide all among the creditors ; after al debts paid, surplus to be given to the Smiths; a covenant by the creditors to accept their debts vitthout suing the Smiths. Was this an
greement to carry on the business and share in the profits? The Smiths bad given up the business, and the creditors who had executed the deed were to carry on the business, and b,y calling a meeting of theo creditors, the majority c'ould compel the trustees to carry on the business in any way they might think proper. They could compel tho trustees to carry on the business or to stop it altogether. The Smiths avere nobody until all the creditors were paid ; the trustees were only to act by the desire of the creditors. The appellants acted at the meetings of the creditors. The whole of the persons who had signed the deed were members of the firm of the Stanton Iron Company.
* Mr. Baron BRA?AwELL put a supposititious case to Mr. il
MIr. EIILL-hly Lord, I think I might be justified in answering that question as was suggested by one of the learned judges.-In what way do you mean to use the answer?t Every person who had signed had a vested interest iaj the concern as a partner.
The Couir took time to consider its judgment.

At the sitting of t'he Court John Paul, aged 60, a respectable-looking man, described as a clerk, was placed it the bar to plead to several indictments cbarging him with foTgery and stealing orders for the payment of money, the property of the guardians of the poor of the City of London Union.
There were six indictments of this description against the prisoner, and he pleaded " Not guilty" to the whole of them. A good many of the jurors who were called to try the cases were challenged by the prisoner's counsel, and a good deal of time was occupied in this manner before a jury could be obtained. The Court was nearly filled by gentlemen holding offilcial positions in comwexion with the City of London Union, and the charges against the prisoner appeared to excite considerable interest.
The case proceeded with gainst the piisoner was a charge of having stolen an order for the payment of 378l. 15e 6d., the property of the guardians of the poor of the City of London Union, his masters.
Mr. Bodkin and Mr. M'Intyre conducted the prosecution; Mr. Serjeant Ballantine was retained specially, with Mr. Orridge, to defend the prisoner.
Mr. BoDrxc, in opening the case for the prosecution to the jury, said that, although it was undoubtedly one of very great importance, yet, the facts he should have to lay before them were in a very narrow compass, and he was afraid that, so far as the prisoner was concerned, it would be very easy and simple in proof, and he therefore felt it unnecessary to occupy their time by any lengthened statement. When he stated that the prisoner at the bar had been clerk to the guardians of the poor of the City of London Union, he had no doubt that it would at once ciai to their recollection the enormous frauds that had been the subject of investigation, and which, coupled with others of. a similar kind that had recently been mnade public, had undoubtedly shocked to a very great extent the moral sense of the community. He was sure, however, that it was unnecessary for him to request that they would not allow what they had heard upon the subject to influence their decision on the present occasion, and he should merely state shortly wbat was the nature of the case that he intended to place before them against the prisoner, and they would decide, no doubt, acoording to the evidence. He had already informed them that the prisoner had been employed as a clerk to the guardians of the City of London Union, under a gentleman named Rtowsell, wFho was the chief clerk, and it was the- custom, in carrying on the business of the union, to hand to the prisoner checks for the payment of persons who hadolsimauponit, and on the 2d of September, in last year, a check for the amount mentioned in the indictment was given to the prisoner to be paid to Messrs. Kingsford, f'ho carred on an extensive business as flour factors, and who had a claim upon the union for flour they had supphed. It would be proved that the prisoner, in stead of applying the check to its proper purpose, on thfe 13th of ;eptember paid it in with other imoney to his owvn banker on his own private account; and on the 17th of December the prisoner absconded, and a reward was offered for his apprehension, and in consequence probably of that reward being offered he was apprehended on the 30th of December, and taken before the Lord MIayor, by whom he was eventually committed uponthe present charge. He should show, in addition to these facts, that upon the discovery of the circumstance that the money had not been paid to Mr. Kingsford Mr. Rowsell had a communication with the prisoner upon the subject, when he admitted that he had misappropriated the check, and entreated Mr. Rowsell not to inform the guardians of the fact; and that gentleman, from a feeling of kindness towards the prisoner, agreed to do so, and paid the amount to Mr. Kingsford out of his own pocket. If this had been the only transaction the matter would in all probability never have been made known, but proceedings of a similar character were afterwards discovered, which rendered concealment altogether hopeless; and the facts coming to the knowledge of the pardians they felt that they had no alternative, considering the position they held and the duty they owed to the ratepayers, many of whom, no doubt, were with great diffi. culty enabled to meet the demands that were made upon them, but to institute the present prosecution.
The following itnesses were then examined*-
Mr. Stephen HodgeonHeath, examined byMr.Mwxysp-. -I am one of the guardians of the poor of the City of London Union. The urisonerhad been for manyyears assistantclerk to the gurdians. His salary was 2001. a-year, and he also had apartments for hnmself and family rent free. He occupied that office on the 2d of September last. I was present at a meeting of the guardians on that day.
Mr. Bldred, formerly a clerk to the guardians, was here called to produce the minute-book of the 2d of September, andhestated, inanswerto questions putbyMr. SerjeantB.- LANraM-, that he was aware that the prisoner was in the habit of paying some of the union checks to his own private account at his banker's, and then paid the wrties who were entitled to them by checks of his own; nd he also said that he had himself filled up some such checks for the prisoner to sign. He likewise stated that there were printed orders demfiing the duties of the clerks in 1850, and he suppd these rules were cted upon. Mir. Thornton was the chrirman of the board in 1.6, but he did not know whether he was now In attendance, The accounts were audited every three or six months.
The witness stated, in answer to questions put by Mx. cODks, that he had never himself paid in any of the union checks to the prisoner's private account, and he was not aware that he had told him so, but he was aware that it had been done. It was generally done when there were a number of small accounts to be paid, and one check was given for the whole amount, and the prisoner paid that in and gave his own checks for the amounts due to the differ. eot parties. The aggregate amount of the checks of this description was not more than 1901.
Serjeant BA ?LANTV here interposed, and contended that the checks themselves ought to have been produced, and theinquiry was not further proceeded with.
Mr. Heath was then further examined. He said,-The prisoner acted as assstant-clerk to the board of guardiaUs on the2d of September. Mr. Rowsell, the chief clerk, was not present. he check now produced, for 3781. 15s., was given to the prisoner in my presence to pay Kingsford and Co., one of the contractors for flour to the union. I saw the same check gain onthe 17th of December. It had then been cancelled. The prisoner ought to have given the check to Messrs. K.ingsford and Co., and he had no authority to payitintohis own private accountto hisownbankers. I discovered the check in the private desk of the prisoner in the house he lived at, belonging to the union, in St. laryaxe. The prisoner had left his residence at this time. Be might properly be in possession of cancelled checks belonging to the union.
Cresexamined.---I have only been conneted with the union 12 months. I have heard the prisoner has been connected with it for 20 7ears. I was not awase of his payin the union checks to his own private account. If IhadI should have immediately moved for his suspension. I know now, of course, that it has been done, but the board of guardians knevr nothing of it. Eired was discharged for not informing the board of the fact that Paul used to pa the union checks to his own account. The prisoner may have paid his own checks to the union creditors to the extent of many thousands of ,counds.
Re-examined.-Until these discoveries were made witness knew nothing of the prisoner having used the checks of the union in this manner. The accounts of the union ought in the proper cowrse to have been discharged by their own bankers, Smith, Payne, and Co.
Mr. J. R. Glenville, a clerk in the Bank of London, proved that the prisoner had a private account at that bank, and that on the 13th of September the check in question was paid in to the prisoner's account with other money, amounting in the whole to 4431. 15s. 6d.
Mr. T. Pinder, a clerk to Smith, Payne. and Co., proved that the cheek was paid by them on the 13th of September.
Mr. J. T. Rowsell said,-Iwas in September lastprincipal clerk to the board of guardians of the city of London union. I countersigned the check for 3781. 1os. and handed it to the prisoner, and it was his duty to have paid it to Messrs. Kingsford. The prisoner left the office on the 17th of December. Before this I hbadspoken to him on the subject of the check for Messr. Kingsford. This took place in Novem'ber. I spoke to the_prisoner in consequence of somaething I had heard froa lMessrs. Kingsford, and, fiding the check had been paid, I asked the pnsoner for a receipt. He hesitated f'r a moment, and did not give any answer. I left the office for a moment, and when I returned the prisoner said it was useless to deceive me-he had used the money, and he implored me to save him from the ruin of a disclosure, and having a great esteem for him, and knowing the general good estimation he was held in, and that he had been 20 years in the office, I promised not to inform the guardians
and to pay the money, and he was to repay me, and I accordingiy paid Messrs. Kingsford from my own funds on the 6th of ,ecember. The prsoner told me that this and another check were all that he had misappropriated.
Cross-examined.-My duties were defined by a paper published under the authority of the guardians several yeas ago. I had very hard work to do, and part of it was to instruct the other officers of the union inthe performance of their duties. I frequently gave instructions to the prisoner. I never knew that he was in the habit of payiR the union checks to his own private account. I neverheard of his doing such a thing. Part of my duty was to read al acts of Parliament haviDg reference to the Poor Laws
Mr. Serjeant BALLA?NTINE.-.And to understand them s
M1r. Justice WIXGHQn,U.-Ii that part of the printed instruction, that he was to understand all the acts of Parliament that were passed? (A laugh.)
Mr. Serjeant BALL.MNE.- no, my lord, nothing so monstrous would, of course, be required of any one. (Renewed laughter.)
Cross-examination continued.-It was not my general duty to examine the accounts, but that was part of my duty. I did not do it personally. The auditor checked the accounts, and I am not aware that they were checked or looked into by any other person. The prisoner toldme that he had overpaid. one account to the amount of 2501., and I found that le had paid Messrs. lee that amount, and had not received the money from the board.
Ple-examined.-It was afterwards ascertained that money ras due to Messrs. Lee upoir a former account, and that checks had been given by the guardians to pay that money with, which the prisoner had ikept back, and, alowing for the money paid by the p2isoner, there was still a balance due
to them:'
A stateinent of the duties of the prisoner as defined by the board of guardians was here put in and read.
In answer to a question put by Serjeant BALLAi;=g, the witness said that a check for.2501j was drawn by the board of guardians upon the supposition that the prisoner had reaDy paid his own money to threm, but when the real facts'were diecovered he paid that check back to the trea-
- , r. lfrd Kigefrd epoed tat is irmform erly supplied the City of LondonUnion vitth flourm and he proved ,that the prisoner did not paj hum the check'on the 13th of
Eeptember, and he did not'-redover the money until the 6th of December, when it was paid into their bakers. - '
The check was then put ih and read, and this closed the case for the prosecution.
Mr. Serieant BALTnm then proceeded to addiess the jury for the prisoner, le said he could not help thinking that his learned friend Mr. Bodkin inuat have felt that he bad a very, weak case from the manner in which he-had opened it to the jury, and the prejudice be had attempted to cast upon the prisoner by talking about enormous frauds that he was represented to have committed, and-other topics of a similar character that could only have been introduced with a view to prejudice the minds of the jury, and induce them to come to a conclusion adverse to the prisoner. The learned cousel for the prosecution had also talked about the guardians coming forward to perform a public duty in carrying out this'prosecution; but he co'uld not help obEerving that if they had done their duty ua guardians before these transactions took place the frauds that were now complained of never could have been committed, and the ratepayers would not have sustained the loss they had done. The jury, however, had nothing to do with the question whether enormofb frauds had been committed or not; and the only point they hadto consider was whether, upon the evidence before them, they would be justified in saying that the prisoner was guilty of the offence of felony; and he hoped to be able to satisfy them that the evidence failed altogether in making out that charge. Although, ss always
appened in such caes, the character of the prisoner's proceedings had been very much exaggerated, he would admit, for the sake of his argument, that the prisoner bad been guilty of most gross neglect of duty, and that he had indeed acted most dishonestly, and was guilty of a very flagrant breach of trust, for which he might be amenable to the law in some other shape, but which certainly did not amount to felony. If it should tum out that the present state of the law did not give power to i'nfict any punishinent for such a breach of trust, it was the duty of tho Legislature to alter it; but It would be A most dangerous thing for the jury to strain the law and to'find a man guilty of felony upon insufficient evidence because they entertained some idea that enormous frauds had been committed, and that those frauds would be unpunished if they did not return such a verdict. The offence Imputed to the prisoner was that he had stolen this cheek, the property of the guardians, his masters, and before he could be legally convicted upon that charge,-and he was quite sure that the learned judgewho-presidedwould confirm his statement of the Ilw upon the subject,-they must be satisfied that at the moment he paid the check Into bis banker's he intended to appropriate theproceeds to his own purposes, and if they should think that be merely paid it in intending to do what it was clear he bad done for many years before-namely, to draw against it, and so discharge the claims upon the union to the amount, but that from some embarrassment or other circumstauce he was unable to do so,-that would only amount to a breach of trust and neglect of duty, and the prisoner ought to be acquitted upon the prssent charge. Only one of the guardians had been ylaced in the witness-box, and he was a gentleman who evidently knew little or nothing of the manner in which the business of the union had been carried on; but he said he was sure the jurv could not entertain any doubt that some of the guardians aud other officers of the union must have been aware that the prisoner was in the habit of paying in the union checks to his own bankers to his owzn pnvate account, and disbursig the amount afterwards through his own checks, and it had been proved that he had done so in one case to the extent of many thousand pounld, and he submitted that there was no evidence whatever to show that when the prisoner paid in this check he intended to apply it to his own use, The learned serjeant concluded a very eloquent speech by expressing an earnest hoe tbat, whatever opinion the jury might entertain of the conduct of the prisoner, they would not strain the law and convict him of an offence that was not established by legal evidence.
Mr. Justice WIGIMLi, in his sumuiing up, said that urdoubtedly before the prisoner could be convicted upon the present charge the jury must be satisfied that when he paid the check into his banlker's he intended to apply it to
hown purposes, and not to pay Messrs. lmgaford with it, and the jury would form their own conclusions upon this point from the facts before them, The prisoner, it was true, appeared to have been in the habit for a contsiderable time o dealing with the checks belonging to the union in the way he had done io the present case, and if it had been at all shown t,bat the guardians had sanctioned the proceedlDg,itmlhthavebeen said that they were content that heO £ouhact in such a manner, and there would have been some foundation for the suggestion that had been made on behalf of the prisoner by his learned counseL This, however, was not the case, and, on the contrary, so far as the evidence went, it was shown that if the guardians had been at all xware of the manner in which the prisoner had been dealing with the checks belonging to the union, they would at once have suspended the prisoner from bis office. The learned judge then called the attention of the jury to some of the other facts in the case, and concluded by atatin that if they weresatisfied that at the time the prisoner paid the check to his banktr he intended to appropriate the proceeds to his own use it would be their duty to fimd him guilty upon the indictment preferred against him.
The ury, hainng deliberated a short time in the box, express a to retire. They left the court at 20 minutes past 12, and returned at ten minutes past 1, and gave a verdict of G~uilty.
The prisoner was at once called up for judgment.
Mr. ustice WIGnTrsu, in passing sentence, said that the prisoner had been convicted of stealing.a check, the proerty of the guardians of the poor of the City of London union, his masters, and he thought that no one who had heard tie evidence and the circumstances connected withthe case could fail to feel surprise as well as regret that a man in the position of the prisoner should have been guilty of such au offence. He was a man of apparent respectability; he had a good situation, and received a good salary, and was certainly in a state of comparative ease and comfort, and, s he observed before, it was a matter for surpnase as well as regret that a man in such aosition should have committed a crime of the description oftheono of which he had been convicted, there being at the same time too much reason to believe that he had committed others of a simir character to a very great extent, Establishments like unions were necessazily open to suffer from the depredations of dishonest persons who were in their service, but he could not help observing that if the rules of the union had been strictly carried out they would have thrown great difficulties in the way of those wh
de8iredto commit offences ofthis description. Onthe present occasion there appearedto have beenagreatfailureonthe part of those connected with the union m aking use of the checks that were in their power, and in not makinea proper exanination of the accounts, and the result had been that frauds had been committed to a very great extent; and the confidence that had been placed in the prisoner moet fearfully abused. The case, he considered, was one of very great aggravation, and he thereford felt it to be his duty to pas the highest sentence fixed by the law for that offence,which was that he be transported for 14 years,
The prisoner did not appear at all affected when the sentence was pronounced, and when the learned judge had conduded he left the bar without uttering a word,
The other indictments againstthe prisoner were, of course, abandoned.

Mr. XEcCAIX9, in his opening speech for the prosecuion, said that the inquiry the jury were about to enter into was one of a very meancholy character, because the death Of oneididual Was involved in it alreadyj and undoubtedly the interests of the prisoner, who was a youn man of good character and of great respectabilit, and who at the time of the occurrence occupied a highlyrespectable position in society, were also deeply involved in the inquiry, He then proceeded to state that the prisoner at the time of the occurrence was assistant to Mr. B udd, a chymist at Brompton, and the deceased was a respectable tradesman residing in the eame neighbourhood It a
pearedthat on the 27th of December tho deceased felt slightly indisposed, and sent to the shop of the prisoner's master for an ounce of castor oil; the boy who was sent on the errand was served by the prisoner, and he took back with him to his master's house what he conceived to be castor oil, and the unfortunate deceased took the greater portion of it. e was almost immediately seized with convulsions, and, although a medical man wassent fordirectly, his aid was of no avail and he died shortly afterwards, A post mortem examiiiation of the body took place, and it turned out that the death had been caused by the administration of prussia acid, and upon the remaining. portion of the oil in the phial being analyzed it was found to contain a conaiderable portion of that mgredient. The learned counsel, in conclusion, said that it was under these circumstances that the prisoner was cbarged with baving by his gross negligence caused the death of the deceased' and, although, or course, it was not for a moment imputei
to him that he had the slightest intention of causing so lamentable a result, yet the law in such cases required that all persons dealing with such deadly ingredients should exercisea.proper degree of caution for the prevention of any mischievous consequences, and if they neglected to use that caution they were answerable for the result.
Witnesses were then examined, wh6 made out the statesment of the learned counsel for the prosecution. It appeared that at the time the boy went to the shop for the castor oil the prisoner was engaged in making up a lotion for the eye, w 'ch should have contained a drachm and a ua-1 o prus acid, -and it a sugete tha he had by -
half of prulssic acaia, ana it wssuggested that he had by mistake put the prussic acid into the castor oil, instead of the lotion, as the latter, upon being analyzed, was found to contain only a most minute portion of the acid, The boy, howev er, wo fetched the castor oil was only enabled to stae nat he saw thepnsoneztake down two bottles of a large sire, and take his phial to the part of the shop where precription were made up, and he then saw him go to a cupboard and put a book in it, but he could give no infornation from wimch bottle tho prisoner poured out what ho gave himfin the phial.
Mrr. Budd, the prisoner's master, said that he carried on business as a chyoust at Brohipton-own Brompton, ani the prisoner was in his service, and attnded, in the shop, and it was his duty to make up prescriptionC anid serve customers, and he kept a book, whibh he produced, bu
vhich he entered all the transactions that took puo in the shop. On the day of this occurrence ihe' prisoner had to minde up An eye lotion that should have contained a. dlrachmn and a-half of prossic acid, andl he appeared to have made an entry in the book to the effect that he bad prepar ed. this lotion.
This witn es refe red to answer the questihns that we e
pute to himby the csounselfor the prosecution with some relctaceandseeedto treat the matter very lightly, Mr. lrecale.fequntyrequesting him not to fence with the quesion tha heputto him, and also complaining of his lauhin wilegivnghis evdence, observing that the ques-

mot letter send for tho eyo lotion he had supplied, and he told him that he had better not do so, and he said the reason he said so was that he thought an " unpleasant constructioun might be put upon it, as he knew it contained pruasic acdd.
Mr. Serjeant BAA xmm, in his address to the jury for the defence, said that cses of this d tion ere of the Inostpejnfui character to be Investigated, tecaue, athough it was mot pretended for a moment that the young man at 'the bar had the slghtest intention to do any wrong ct, yet, if tbe iury should be of opinion that he had throuh negh gence beenthe means of causing the death o£ the deceased, he might be convicted of manslughter, and his future popcsin life bo thereby uttrl estroyed.

inm gurity of manslaughter.

THIRD COUPT.
(Before the Co3moX SERJEANT1
William John Gardiner, 28, clerk, pleaded " Guilty" to several indictments charginghim with stealing various sums (f money, the property of Joseph Hornby Banendale and others, his masters.P Y dalers
Mr. SLEIGII, who appeared for the prosecution, stated that the sumsIn81 question had been paid by various porters in the prosecutors employment to the prisoner, whose defalcations amounted to nearly 1501.
He was sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment.
HenryvHall, 28, labourer, was incicted for attempting to defraud Benjamin Wilson.
Mr. LiDey prosecuted, and Mr. Sleigh defended.
The manner in which the prisoner had attempted to defraud theprosecutor was somewhat new. The prosecutor was upon tha 18th of January passing through Letticoatlane, when the prisoner and a Jew attracted his attention by walking at his side and bargaining about a chain which prisoner had wrapped in paper in his hand. Prisoner, after two or three offers from the Jew, which he refused came up to prosecutor, and said it was no use trying to sell anything to those men, as they would never give a fair pnce for anhing, and then offered to sell the chain in question, which he said weighed 2Joz., and was 16 carat gold, for 56s, and gave the prosecutor to understand that it hadbeen stolen from his (the prisoner's) master's stock. After some conversation prosecutor, under the pretence that he had no money, made an appointment to meet theprisoner that evening, which he did, and, having apprised the police of the matter, a constable was present, and took prisoner into custody. The chain, upon being examined, was found to be worth about 2s.
Mr. SsrGso did not deny the facts, and the prisoner was Conrict4d,but
The Commo SERmiAT said he should defer Fpasing sentence until he had considered some legal objections 'which Mr. Sleighx had rAised.
Thomas Ridaer, 27, labourer, was indicted for perury. 3r. Salter prosecuted, and Mr. Giffard defended.
The case, which lasted until late in the evening, and was somewhat complicated, appeared to be this:-The sister of the prisoner had, through some connexion with a sea catain, who had been engaged in the sale of a vessel to Mr. Salisbusy, of the West India Dock-road, Poplar, made a claim upon him, lr. Salisbury, for 600Z, which the defendanrt, Mr. Salisbury, denied. Mr Ridaer had in consequence served Salisbury with a writ of action, and the matter now stands for triaL Early in November Mrs. Ridaer applied to Mr. Justice Crompton in chambers to have Mr. Salisbury arrested, upon the ground that he was about to leave the country, and filed an affidavit, sworn to bythepioner, who dep se tohatvhienrg upon a particular

BriMnA11 for further examination, charged with having robbed his employers to a lage extent-, an embezi ed money received on their sccunt.
Mr. Waller appeared for the prosecution, and Mr. Levis, of Great Marlborough-street, for the prisoner.
From the evidence, which was of considerable length, the following circumstances were elicited:-The prisoner en. tered the servico of Messrs Alison about 18 months ago, and the utmost confidencewas reposed in him until about a week ago, being a day or two before he was taken into custody. Iu coneequenco of one of the town travellers of Messrs. Alison seeing some goods ata milliner's, Madame Studer, in Bluton-atreet, with the private marks of the firm on them, he communicated the fact to one of the partners, who set on foot ain inquiry immediately, aud the result was a commumication to the police. Detectives Tanner and Robinson were employed to watch the move. inents of the prsone and, having traced him to Madame Studer's hose, tib prisoner was questioned by his employers and asked whether lie had sent out any goods to customers on approbMfion. The prisoner replied in the negative; and when asked if he hd sent any goods on gale or return to Madame Studer, he denied at first he had done so, but afterwards he admitted he liad sent goods there.
Te prisoner when given into custody admitted his guilt He osid hehad Wrobbed his employers because tho women with whom he had become acquainted wanted so much money. The police subsequently asoertained that the prisoner was under e entr to two women to marry them. The police pursuevtheir inquiries, and the reault was the discovery an,! recovere of a lirge quantity of valuable property, which the ptrsoner mnust ave purloined from the
ock at different times, consisting principaly of silks

Tubbs, the relieving officer of Maryleone, attended before Mr. Loxia, staing that on his way down to this court from the work. house, at which he, with the mid of other officers of the establishment had In the course of the day afforded assist. ance to nearly 4,000 persons, he wan followed by u
wards of 250 men, mnny of them not belonging to the parish, and whose applications for relief had thercfore not been complied with. The whole of the said men, some of whom had threatened him In violent langage, were wait. 5ng outside to be admitted
The magistrate did not enter further into tbe matter, and npon the closing of the ooort the body of men-there being several of the police in attendanc3 -made their way again towards the wForkhouse.
CLEBREXwL.-Peter M'Grath, a rough-looking fellow, a blac'ksmith, residing at 2, Law-stret, Bethnal-green, was placed at the bar, charged with riotous conduct and stealng a loaf, anda sowith assaulting Pendrill, 101 G, in the execution of his duty.
It appeared that the prisoner formed one of a gang who had been attending the Smithfield meeting, and on their return home made up their minds to enter the baker's shop. This reolution was no sooner formed than they at once proceeded to a baker's shop kept by Mr. Hains, in Clerkenwell, where the prisoner stole a loaf, but, owing to the excelent arrangements made b7 Mr. Superiatendent Martin, of the G division, to prevent not and disturbance, the police were at once on the spot, and the mob was dispersed. The prisoner
as ta ken into custody by PendriD, 101 G. and was ssaulted by himansosonas he laid hold of him.
The magistrate sent the prisoner to the HTouse of Correction for one month, with hard labour-14 days for stealing the bread, and 14 days for the assault on the con-
THAses.-George Bolam, a tall, ablebodied man, aged 23, and residing at No. 7, Marmon.street, St. Georges in. the-East, was rought before Mr. YAUDL6Iy, charged with demanding broad at several bakers' shops in the Commercial. road.
WiUiam Coxall, a polie-constable, No. 280 K, stated that he saw theagrisoner and several other men go into bakerse ihops in e Commercial-road, and Ask for bread, while sthers waited outside. There were about 30 ablebodled men in the gag,andaboys and others werefollowing them,and made upte niumberto 150.
In answer to a nquestion from Mr. YARDLEY the witness ad he took the prisoner into custody because he was the spokesman. of the party.
The Prisoner-I am ont of work and in want. I only went into one shop and asked for a bit of bread.
Mr. William Smith, a baker, aid tho prisoner and others came into his shop. There was a mob outside. The prisoner had his hands in his pockets, and said, Bread we want, and bread wo will have." Thl prisoner also :aid he and his companions bad been in all the bakers' shops in the road and obtaned bread from each. The witness, on bein questioned by Mr. YARDLEY, aid ho bad been giving bread away all day to distressed persons, who ought to have been properlyreleved at the differnt unions He was surptised, but not alarmed, when so many men entered his shop.
Mr. YARDLzy asked whether any of the prisoner's companons were in the court.
The Pxisoner.-I don't know any of tbem.
fr.YARDLzY in a long and eloquent address, ointed out the illegaty of the proceedings adopted by the prisoner and his companions. He sentenood the] prisoner to 14 dayE' imprisonment and hara labour for begging, and he did so with great pain and reluctance.
Edward Holey, a labourer, aged 28, of No, 10, Chancery. place, Shadwell, was charged with using abusive language and inciting a mob to stel bread at the Ratcliff Workhouse.
It apeed from the evidence of Snelling, the porter at the workouse, and Stradling, a police-constable, No. 231, that on Tnesday great numbers of persons belonging to the parishes and hamlets of the Stepney Union were relieved and the labour test applied, Among them was the prisoner, who received a loaf of bread and some oatmeal only, and was set to work in the stoneyard. On Wednesday getnumbers were relieved without being Eet to work. That morn ing there were a great many applicants for relief, and the pnroner and others were told that no relief could be given to them that day. The prisoner was then standing near piles of loaves and said he wanted bread, and bread he would have, and then, addressing the other applicants for relief, said, " Nowr my lads, come on - let us have bread " Fortunately, his appeal was not responded to, and he was immediate y taken into custody. In the course of a long discussion which took place between the magistrate, the porter, and the police-constable, it was not denied that the eirisonsr was in want of food, and that he worked for
of bread on Tnesday, and was willing to work for anotnnr if the labour-test was applied.
- The prisoner, in a respectful manner, said he was very weak and in want of foodwhen he appliedatthe workhouse,
e tol one of the releving officers he had not tasted a bit of food since Wednesday morning, and when he was told to o aw*ay, he said be would not go without a bit of bread.
eals told the relieving officer that his wife and child were at home starving. The taunting reply was, " Fetch them here mn a 'bus. Ee should like to kuow how a poor man like him was to pay omnibus hiiroe
John Russell, a brickayer's labourer out of employ, said he belonged to a parish in the Stepney Inion. He also sought reiief at the Ratcliff Workhouse that morning, and Mr. Sergeant, relieving offcer of Shadwell, said "There will be no relief to-day," onwhich the prisoner said he would not go without bread.
Mr. YASiDLEY asked if he was to understand the labourtest was applied on Tuesday, and relief given on Wednesday without any work being required.
Snelling-Yes, Sir.
Mr. YARDLzY.-And relief was refused altogether to. dn.elling.-Yes, Sir.
Mr. YARDLurte.-Why did you not offer them relef on the labour-test this day?
SneDing.-I don't know, Sir. They bad bread and oatmeal yesterday.
Mr YilE:Y said the authorities of the Stepney Union I seemed to act with marvellous inconsistency. One day relief was given with the labour-test, another day without it, and on the third no relief at all was given. St. Pancras parish, s he read in the newspapers, had acted consistently. Extra prenises had een taken, and relief given to all, and the laboour-test applied to all who were able to work. He could not conceive a satisfactory solution to the extraordinary conduct of the board of guardians of the Stepney Union. He scarcely knew what to say to it. This was a period of great pressure, owing to the great numbers who were out of employ, and the pressure should be met by extraordinary esertions on the part of the authorities. There was a large staff of clerks, relieving officers, porters, masters, and
matrons of workhouses and others in the Stepney Union, and matters ought to be well regulated. If the Prisoner made use of strong language he did very wrons-. The most
dificult task he had to perorm wa in tegard to the administration of the Poor Lawqi: Day-b day crowds of persons camne before him who said 'they eould not get relief, and he amd-his colleague referred theii to the 'parishes and unions in the district. He wis repeatedly told that every proper object was rehleved, but, takingthe porter's own statement, zo relief was given that day.
Snelling.-Some were relieved and set to work this day. Mr. YAItDLZY said that at such a time as this all ought toh.ve been relieved, andl all who could work should have beCn set toworlr. He could niotuliaerstand the conductof the 'workhouse a-uthorities. It was quiteincolasistont, but the prisoner had no right to use the laniguage he did. It was Xis (tho n agistrates) duty to repress all violations of the aW. At the same time he could- not but condemn the-inconsistency oftheoauthorities- of the Stopnd3-nUeon. He believedl the prisoner was a workmaan and in great distress. On Tuesday the lIbour-test was appliea,t and the prisoner worked for hits loaf The priner
was desirous of doing the samething again, but for some reason he could not understand he was prevented doing Eo. The magistrates were continually sending the poor to the workhouses for relief, and when theygot tfere there wastoo,
often none for them. There was ao doubt the man before' him was in grea distress.
Snelning.-No doubt of tbst, Sir.
Hr. YARDLEY.-Then, why was not relief given ? I have told men over and over agan they have a right to relief, Where are the officers of the Stepney UJnion?
SneDting.-They are not here, bir.

Colonel Tulloch's Review Of The "Chelsea" Report.*
tVOLNBL TULLOOH'S REVIBW OF THE
" CHELSBA' REPOBT.*
(o-tinuedfromn ne' Times of Feb. 3,1857.)
Mter leaving Lords Lucan and Cardigan, the V'bftrvations of Colondl Tulloch are directed in the next place to the case of the Quartermuaster-General, Sir CICIHARD A-Uy. For nearly two months the men were separated from their knapsacks, and deprived of almost every article of clothing except what they had upon their backs, and this at a time 'when they were suffering from the severest weather andfromconstant exposurebynightandday, and were employed in the trenches on fatigue duties, whieh toon redueed their only suit to rags. Such, indeed, was the destitution of the troops in this respect that, as they landed fever-stricken and eovered with filth and vermin on the shore of Scutari, it excited the astonishment and awakened the sympathy of all Europe. Was this deprivation, then, the result of tercumstances beyond control, or were the Commissioners right in regarding it as one of those events against which a moderate degree of foresight might have provided 9
The Chelsea Board attributes the separation of the znen from their knapsacks to the department of the Adjutant-General,buttheCommissionerscomplained, not of the separation, but that no prompt measures were takento recover them. The Board makes light of the ineonvenience by stating that the packs contained very little that could have added to the comfort of the men, a proportion of their necessaries having been left in the squladbags at Scutari. Colonel Tulloch properly replies that the knapsaek is valuable to the soldier, not merely for what it contains, but as a means of keepi'g his necessaries together; that for the want of it the shirt, boots, and Focks brought in his blanket on landing were in most cases lost even before he reached Sebastopol. The knapsack did, however, contain, among other things, a pair of trousers, which was not such a trifing object to men shivering in tatters; and if the knapsacks were sailing about the Black Sea, the zquad-bags, containing the shell-jackets, shirts, and socks, were, at all events, stationary, and there could be no difficul-r in knowing where to find part at least of the soldier's equipment. Yet in most cases ti e whole of the first winter was allowed to pass vithout their being sent for. Out of a total of 20 reginents none recovered them till the end of Deeember or beginning of January, when five regiments had that good fortune; two did not receive them till February or March, and the remainder not till Ap:il or May, the soldier bein,g left during most of the interval almost in rags, a prey to vermin, and without a change of any kind. Atleastitmmghthave been expected thatthedestitute sick and wounded who landed at Scutari in the early part of the winter might have found these articles forthcoming, but the phantom garments eluded their search, and, if the sick soldier at length obtained the covering which cleanliness and decency required, the relief was due to Tlhe Tims 5 fund and to the resources supplied by private charity. To the neglect whichwas then evincedwe have nowto add, onColonel Tulloch'l showing, the k2ches of the Board, who made no inquiry regarding the fate of these squad-bags,and who seem to have contented themselves with t'ae fact that they were not forthcoming as an incident quite in the order of Providence, and which tencls rather than otherwise to the credit of Sir Richard Airey.
On the next head, the "Issues of Warm Clothing from England," Colonel Tulloch contends, in reply to the Board, that when the Commissary-General was not prepared to provide transport for its conveyance the Quartermaster-General was bound to have brought under the consideration of the General Commanding-in-Chief the consequent difficulties in which he was placed, and the question would then have arisen whether extra transport animals should not have been obtained froml the opposite coast to carry up these supplies. The scarcity of transport was a difficulty which the Commissioners were neither disposed to conceal nor to underrate; but, whatever it may have been, on the other hand it could afford no excuse to the Quartermaster-General for not having made the regiments or divisions acquainted with the clothing in store, so that they might send for their proportions if they chose. Sir Richard could not know what exertions the men might be disposed to make themselves, or their officers to make for them, in order to get up supplies so essential to their existence. No such exertions, however, could be expected when nothing was known by either of the stores being there. Colonel Tulloch estimates that a very small number of men would, in fact, have stfficed to carry up these stores to the front. The employment of 100 men from each regiment for a single day in the earlv part of December would have carried up all the rugs, greatcoats, and watchcoats, and another day and a like number of men would have sufficed in the end of that month, when further supplies of these and the additional blankets had arrived. Besides
the larger portion of the force at B3alaklava and Kadikoli had no difficulties as to transport; they were close to the stores, and yet apparently shared no better in the division of them than the men in front:-
* It must always be kept in view tbat at the period when these various supplies of clothing were not made available the men awere falling by thousands under the rapid stroke of cholera and dysentery, or the slow torture of frost. bite- while morning after morning they returned from sitting knee-deep in mud of the trenches to teots the floors of which were scarcely drier, their only clothing coneisting of the regimental suit, which, to borrow the words of Sir Richard Airey, they had had a ir the first voyage out to the Mediterranean, through the service in Bulgaria, through the sea-voyage to the Crimea; theyhxd worked in these coats in the trenches, and fought all through with themn; they were perfectly threadbare, and in many instances did not exist.'
' While this was the condition of the army, tho knap. sacks were on the Black Sea, the squad-bags at Soubari, thousands of pairs of trousers mn ssing, thousands of coatees umused, and tens of t' ousands of greatcoats, blankets, and
gb fillin a the Quartermaster-Generals stores or the The Commissioners, under these circumstances held that " the arrangements relating to the issue of the supplies from the Quartermaster-General's store" were " of questionable expediency." The Board, on the other hand, considered the principle adopted in their apportionment " a very judicious one,'" but then the Board assumed that orders had been sent that the regiments should apply for them according to their strength,which Sir JohnCampbell and Sir Richard England have contradicted. Moreover, while the poor cavalry horses were losing half their lttle barley for wvant of nosebags, and0were eating each others' tails in lieu of more substantial nutriment, the following was the simultaneous ex~erience of Lord Lucan:--" The Quartermaster-
eneral always said that they had not got them in the army, till the Captain of the Jason came to me to beg that I would assist him in relieving his ship of all those horse stores." In like manner the same arithority may be cited to prove that the horse medicines, after being urgently required for five or six months, were at last discovered on board the Medway in the month of January.
lnjustice to Sir Richard Airey it ought to be stated that during a large portion of this time, from the 16th of November till the 18th or 20th of December, he was prostrated-by illneEs. And in justice to the Commissioners it should be added that this was the reason why he was not himself examined by them as to the delays and omissions in issuing the clothing. Colonel Gordon and Colonel Wetherall acted in his stead during the interval of his illness, and the petulant and baseless recriminations of the former, and the discrepancies and self-contradictions of the latter, are most material topics in this review of Colonel Tullocli. The unenviable position which these gentlemen must henceforth occupy after his
searciing exposure must also to a considerable ex. tent be shared by the Board itself, who in the case of Colonel Gordon endorsed his puerile cavils without warranty or fair examination. The questions thereby opened comprehend too many details to be capable of clear explanation here, and they must be followed through their minutihe to their full solution, paragraph by paragraph, in the volume itself. One or two specimens only of their tendency shall be given, and our readers must judge for themselves the bearing of the remainder. Colonel Wetherall, for example, has to explain why certain coatees were not issued to tle troops, and the answer is-first, that they were found to be too small, by reason of the great quantity of underclothing worn by the men, when at the date they arrived, the 28th of NToverabe, the men 7d no unden-dothing at all, and when most of them were without even a shilt, except wvhat they had had on their backs ever since the'r a;rivalin the Crimea, Secondly, the coatees " were not issued, because the new clothing for each regi:
xent was shortly expected," an expectation which,
bowegv'r, was not realized till' two months lfter. Thirdly, they "would probably have been isued,'but

their being in store was notreported." And, fourthly, they were not issued because at the time they arrived " the regimental clothing had also arrived of which the Commissioners in the Crimea received the information under the second head, that ' it was shortly expeced.'" These excuses exceed in variety and incongruity those of the old lady who declined to lend her washing-tub, but they are not more contemptible than the complaint of Colonel Gordon, and which was lightly and loosely sanctioned by the Board, that he had not a sufficient opportunity of correcting his evidence, when his evidence remained in his hands from June to September, with a written authority from the Commissioners to
alter it as he thought fit ;" when he made nearly 1OO alterations in consequence, and finaUy re-wrote the whole of it, and had, moreover, himself testified that " nothing was more liberal than the way in which the Commissioners behaved to him." And, finally, this may be capped by the Board itself, who, when a question arose as to the relative value of rugs and blankets, which they could have determined by sending to the Ordnance Department for a sample of each, and ascertaining their
relative weight and material, contented themselves with the discrepant evidence of the two Colonels thus ludicrously distinguished.
But we must follow Colonel TaUloch to the larger and concluding section of the Board's Report, which is entitled " Co.rSSARY-0 AL D s CAsE," to comprehend fully the farce of a review of the Commissioners' inquiry by men who had none of them a Crimean experience. The general question between Mr. Filder and the Commissioners, of which there are numerous branches, was as to the sufficiency of the supplies in store. Of these the first item is bscuit, of which the Commissioners observed that the ration was reduced on the 7th of November to llb., on the expressed ground of the supply of biscuit being insufficient to furnish the increased ration lately authorized. Mr. Filder contended that there was at all times a sufficiency of suppllesinstore,butiscontraditedinrespectof biscuitby the General Order of Lord Raglan. At all events, Mr. Filderjustifies this proceeding, and the Board came to the conclusion that he "I vas justified in recommending the discontinuance of the extra allowance," for reasons which Colonel Tulloch thus reduces to their true ditmensions.
Mr. Filder contends that "the established ration for troops in the field was not reduced," and with this he contents himself. It is no concern of his that the established ration does not, according to every trustworthy scientific authority, contain an amount of nutriment sufficient to support anymanin health; and that evenwith rice, sugar, and coffee it would be inadequate to maintain for any considerable time the strength and health of soldiers undergoing severe labour, with the watching and exposure they underwent in the Crimea. Vegetables were then wanting, and the soldier was placed in circumstances under which, whatever might be his wants, he could purchase nothing for himself. Such was the condition of the troops on the 7th of November, when, with scurvy in the camp, Mr. Filder recommended that the issue of one-third of a pound of biscuit per man should be discontinued, not because there was any scarcity in the supply, but, as he alleges, because it was notorious that the
men could not consume 1 1-Sib. of biscuit, but sold or gave away a part of what they received to the French troops who frequented our lines.
It is admitted by Colonel Tulloch to have been notorious, not that the biscuit was more than the men could eat, but that it was frequently exchanged for fresh bread, because that necessary of life could not be obtained from the British Com-
missariat, even for the sick- but this traffic, far from being stopped by the reduction in the ration of biscuit, appears rather to have increased as the season advanced, and the diet of salt meat and bisouit became day after day more and more intolerable. The practice was adopted not by the men only, but by the officers; and, considering that hard biscuit is described by several of the re-
ginental surgeons as being not only distasteful, but injurious to men who were suffering from bowel affections, the exchange was rather to be commended than found fault with.
Not only was there a reduction in the ration of biscuit, which, therefore, the alleged reasons are not sufficient to justify, but on the 15th of November the rice was also ordered to cease, so that in one week the troops were, in most cases, deprived of nearly half a pound of the vegetable and farinaceous food so much required to counteract a salt meat diet, and this too when scurvy had established itself, and the fresh vegetables which were looked for were not forthcoming. The diet of the soldier in respect of nutriment, as shown by the tables of Professo: 0hristison, was not only thus reduced to
less than that of the Hessian soldier by nearly ten
ounces a day, but it was less than what is considered necessary, for example in the prison at Perth, to maintain health even in confinement. If the Board of General Officers had referred to such facts as these
they would have been less disposed to second Mr.
Filder's theory that 131b. of biscuit was more than the men could eat. We have already observed they were utterly destitute of experience of the particular circumstances which had a further bearing upon the case before them. As Colonel Tulloch says, it is possible theymayhave been influenced by a recollection of theusual accessories to a soldier's ration in other localities and under happier circumstances, but which the experience of a Crimean General would speedily have dispelled.
On the deficient supply of sadt neat as well as of biscuit the Board made no comment, for " it was apparently too serious a matter fcr seven general officers to express their concurrence in an experiment under which an army was left with only eight days' salt provisions at a season when the communications by sea were liable to interruption." In dealing with a question " of such fearful magnitude" the Commissioners had been already as considerate as they could to Mr. Filder, while conscious that a warning was required against similar shortcomings in future. The discovery of this circumstance, Colonel Tuloch informs us, had the effect of inducing Lord Raglan to call for periodical returns of all the supplies in the Commissariat
store, and was, indeed, as we may fairly infer, a perilous piece of mismanagement, to be permanently referred to for avoidance.
The Board passed over this question, however, to
commit themselves to a characteristic blunder on the subject of " the issues of vegetables and rice." The Commissioners had stated that in the Crimea, during the greater part of November and December, and also in a great measure during January and part of February, the soldier was confined exclusively to biscuit in addition to his salt meat, on which the Board, in their superior judgment,
umdertook to pronounce "'that the statements of the Commissioners are by no means borne out," Colonel Tulloch remarks on this, in a gentle form of comment, " that it is to be regretted that, before asserting thus much, the Board did not refer to the
recorded answers by the ommanding officers of corps to the questions on this head distinctly put by the Com0missioners," and of which he then gives a
summary in corroboration of the Commissioner s' statement. The Board, however, relied upon certain "I returns " of vegetables and rice issued to the
troops during the months in question, without troublingthemselves toinquire further. But the
quantity entered as received and issued is no certain
evidene th at the troops received it. as Colonel u ll-
socn aemonstrates in this instance. Of 340-- 81b b of vegetables stated to have been issued to the troops in November, 336,0000b., shipped by the Harbinger, left the Bosphorus in a very bad state. That vessel reached Balaklava on the 9th, and lay there till the 24th of that month, because the captain could get no one to take away the cargo. In the meantime the vegetables rotted, and were either thrown overboard or scrambled for on the deck by the Zouaves and such of the soldiers belonging to the division at Balaklava as happened to be present. Had the Board referred to Mr. Drake's accounts they would have found that 263,8421b. were admitted to have been destroyed; few or none of these vegetables reached the troops in front; and how they were disposed of appears in evidence which the Board seems never to have perused, or even to have heard of
In regard to the supply of . vegetables for Decencbebr, if they found their right to correct the Commissioners upon that,--itatpap that it could not have amounte d in - tbe 9ahrse of that month to more than three-quarters of a pound, or about two potatoes anld, oone onwoif per rman, in the course of thirty-one days, provided the sick in hospital did not exhaust the supply. In January the issue would have afforded sbout half-a-pound a-week to eachhindividual, sbject to the same objection with
regard to the i eis iThe whole of Feob-
ruary is also consistent with the alleged deficiency, a
deficiencyfwhich pt6ved so fatal to the troops, and whc, hrepcts cts.g ) and h J an ad relaauar r
et to be explained. So early as the 24th of Ontober it appears that Mr. Filder was informed of the presence of scurvy and was urged to act with promn
titude in this behalf by the Quartermaster-Gener. Tn reply he addressed a remonstrance, stating that it was not his duty ; that according to the atsage of the servce vegetables were provided by re-imental arrangement. Without explaining how the unhappy regiments on the plateau of Sebastopol could " arrange" in their own behalf he made objections to nurchasing potatoes which were for sale in the harbour; and in the vicinity of the market of one of the largest capitals in Europe, where vegetable diet forms a considerable portion of the food of 650,000 inhabitants, for some months the British army were allowed to rot of scurvy for the want of a commodity which there is little doubt that he could have procured them. At all events, the assumnption of the Board that he did supply it, on the ground of which they corrected the Commissioners, is, like many of their assumptions, now finally disposed of.
With respect to the issues of rice during the same period-viz., from November to February inclusive, MIr. Filder endeavoured, apparently with success, to impress upon the Board that, though this was declared by General Order to be no longer a part of the daily ration, the troops actually received within a mere fractional part of the quantity to which the ration would have amounted. It appears never to have occurred to the seven sages that, if this was the case, Lord Raglan would not have incurred the odium of making it appear by his General Orders that his army was deprived of such an eesential. The " returns" of the rice issued, which again misled them, would have been otherwise accounted for if they had not omitted the essenial inquiry, to 'whom had the iSsue been. lade. If they had examined the returns, instead of quoting them, they would have found that in the first of these months about 20,0001b. was issued to Turk;lish troops at Balaklava alone, and about 4,0001b. to the Royal Marines, besides what may have been issued in other parts of the calp ; while in December there were issued 25,1421b. to Turldsh troops and 4,8361b. to the General Hospital at BalakLava, thus confirming what had often' been statedinevidence to the Commissioners, that rice could not be issued to the British soldiers bcecause it was wanted for the Turkish troops. The remainder of the rice may be accounted for without iupposing it was consumed as part of the rations by the men in health, by the large proportion of sick chiefly labouring under scorbutic dysentery and' diarrhoea, with which the camp was crowded, and who absorbed nearly, if not all, the quantity sent up to the front. This, however, Mr. Filder reckons as if it had been part of the daily rations of the troops; and the Board, in the face of Lord Raglan's order, and a vast amount of concurrent testimony, appear to have adopted his representation, though little or no rice was received for upwards of six or seven weeks which could be applied to general use. When the issues of rice were again authorized, though the issues to the Turkish troops had by that time been discontinued, the "returns" show that the quantities were double those of the previous two months; yet the Board, who attached such importance to the bare figures of the returns, never adverted to and possibly never remarked thae significant circumstance.
With respect to the continuance of the issue of rice from the 30th of September to the 15th of November, and which appears to have gone to the sick, the Coummissionersgave Mr. Filder credit for having beenmoved to that judiciousstep by the sufferingsof the troops from diarrhcea. But from his letter to Mr. Peel it appears they were in error in attributing to him such motives, and it would seem that he has yet to be impressed with the essential importance of rice under such circumtances.
" Had Mfr. Filder referred to Peninsular experience to guide these arrangements, he would have found that when the Duke of Wellington's army was suffering from bowel complaint the issue of two ounces of rice per man was authorized as a remedial measure by general orders dated the 1st of August, 1812; and when the Duke was obliged to put his army on two days' salt provisions per week he, by ;eneral order, dated the 26th of October, 1810, directed a similar allowance of rice to counteract the injurious effect of that diet. The Crimean arrangements, however, show the converse of this, as the ver period when the army was subsisting almost entirely on salt meat was that selected for depriving it of rce, though thea doubly valuable for the health of the men.
" The Board conclude their observations, under the head of rice and vegetables, with the followimg remark:-'We may here add, with respect to the remarks of the Commissioners on the subject of vegetable food, that we entirely concur in the view of the Commissary-General that his department is not responsible for the particular articles of diet which constitute the ration of the men; his duty is only to furnish it according to the order of the General Commanding.'
" I am not aware that the Commnisionerg ever expressed any contrary opinion. It can hardly be doubted, however, thae it was the duty of the Commissary-General to keep the General Commanding informed of the supphes of .every description in his possession which could be rendered available for the use of the army, and to call his attention to the expediency, from time to time, of making such changes as they admitted. Had he done so, it might probably have brought out the fact that, while thonsands were suffering from scurvy and scorbutic diarrhoa in their worst forms, 20,0001lb. weight of lime-juice were lying in his custody unused for nearly a couple of months,-and that while l.ord Raglan was authorizing the stoppage of rice and biscuit, in the belief that there was not a suficient quantity of either in store, Mr. Filder had, according to his own statement, abundance of beoth."

The Suspected Case Of Poisoning In Lincoln-
TiE SusPEcTED CASE OF PoisoNriNG iw LnTCOLNSHRE.-The Lincolnshire magistrates have given the necessary order for the exhumation of the remains of Mrs. Bacon the mother of Thomas Fnuller Bacon, who is charged with the murder of his two children at Walworth.

REPuDTIxON IN COA&iFoNiA.-The judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of California, declaring the act for the constraction of a waggon-road across the Sierra Nevada null and void, as being in contravention of the constitutional provision prohibiting the contraction of any State debt over $300,000 without an appeal to the people, is, we take it, only second to the establishment of the Vigilance Committee in historical importance. The effect of the judgment is to leave creditors of the State for an amount exceeding $2,700,000 absolutely without recourse, and to inflict urn the State credit a blow which will be felt for years. It is of course competent to the people and Legislature of California to repair the mischief by passing a new remedial act, assuming the debt, and having the same ratified by he lpeople; and this, if they have either prudence or honour, they wil make haste to do. Bat, with aU their haste, time must elapse before such an act can be passed and ratiflied; and meanwhile the claims of the creditors will be exposed to all the contingencies of their precarious posi ion. The people of California, lke the people of Mississi)pi, may come to think it convenient to pay off their debt without putting their hands in their pocket. New flaws may be discovered in the character of the debt. and ingenious lawyers may show that it may be repudiated without shame. Questions may arise as to the disposal of the money obtained from the creditors, and it may be shown that the State was not the only recipienfjor beneficary thereof. We have seen such things before,,'and there is no reason why we should not see them again. If the question could be settled in half-an-hour by the merchants of San Francisco, no doubt the creditors wouldnot suffer even in imagination for a single day. Bat the hi h- minded men over whom Governor 'Doual presided axe a very small item in the population of the State Their views are not certain to be those of the poor farmers, and miners, and fishermen, and vagrants who wil be caUed upon to vote the ratification of a remedial act. In our opinion, a just Providence is punishig California for the faults of her people. In the days of their prosperity, when human labour andenergy commanded nher rewards than they ever obtained before or since, the Calfornians forgot what they owed to themselves and to us. They disregarded the obligaUons of the citizen, and left their Government in the handsof whatever vagabonds chose to usurp it. Like all other faults, this one is now working out its own punishment. The whole State has only been suatched from universal chaos and anarchy by a revolutionary movement, and a delberate though necessary violation of the law by the first nen in the country. But this perilous experiment did not exhaust the measmre of retribution. Now comes-worse almost than revolution-repudiation ; and California exhibits to the world not only a people whose virtue is shown in their contempt of law, but a people among whom it is justice and -honour to defraud honest creditors of their due. We say it is a judment-a righteous judgment. California may make what amends she can, and pay principal and interest at some futureday; but she cannot wipe the stain from her annals. She cannot obliterate fron men's memories tho damning fact that her people are so unfit to exercise the duty of self-government that they elect magistrates who violate the laws, and who use the high and honourable aame of the -State, by the authority of the people, for the purpose of-swindling the public. These are things which are remembered. lior a generation, at least, the Californians wi lie under a stigma and reproach. Men will be shy of them and cool to them. Not that they have shown themselves any more dishonest or less dishonoumble than their neighbours, but because they havo given evidence of so little sagacity and so much recklessness that one never can be certain that their elected agents are notprofessioal knaves. What hs been done ray be repeated.

BROADSTAIRS HOVELLERS.-There is a heavy sea
13aosDitns HovEL.tzs.-There is a heavy sea running.into the little bay, and the surf breaks over the Meary w sto ; but she pltnges through it, and presently wo hear them setting tho sail. The second lifeboat follows the ALry White; and now the lug;ers are under way. Save those laid up with rheumatism, there is not a hoveDler left in Broadstairs. Why the men employed in saving life and property are caled hovellers I know not, and no one here can inform me. God speed them on their way! While they are absent let us afford a few particulars touching these venturesome men. . . . When at home, on shore, tho hoveller leads a rather lazy life. You may see him leisurely strolling about the pier, or up and down Albion-street, smoking; and now and then you may observe him slanting into the Tartar Frigate or the Dolphin, and coning out again, after pattaling of some liquid refreshment. But you rarely see a hoveller drank or noisy. The truth is, a hoveller can carry a great deal without feeling it, and, like a prudent man, he knows pretty well when to bring hinmself up. Some of the youngsters, after a good haul, go away, and are no more heard of until their money is expended; but the bulk are men who drink as much as they can afford at home, and are seldom out of their houses after half-past 8 or 9 o'clock, at which time, daring the winter months, they usuaBy go to bed. The hoveller, in short, is, to all intents and purposes, a good member of society. He is almost invariably a kind and affectionate husband, an indulgent and good father, and anything but a bad friend. As far as I can see (and I have a very large acquaintance with our hovellers), the wife, in nine cases out of ten, rules the roast, manages the household, and takes care of the bulk of the money received for a prize. . . . . The house of a hoveDer is a curious place. It is very clean and comfortable, but lined with tarpauli garments-coaits, jackets, trousers, eaps. And then e bas such a propensity to pitch every outside wall and sailing that the smell, albeit it is very wholesome, is nevertheless overpowering. The back yard is even more curious than the house. Bits of paneDing from wrecked vessels, bottles aud lars of every nation, and of every size, shape and colour, cooking utensils, bits of old iron, a broken boats an odd oar or two-each teling a tale of somne disaster on the "Gooden," where these matters are mostly picked up. A boveler found there the other day several vases of the beat Bohemin glass and workmanship. Sometimesawatch or a pencilcase} will be picked up on the sand at low water. But among tho most extraordinary things foumd by our
toyellers on or near the Goodwin Sands was an anchor which mst have belonged to one of the largest vessels o jshe ,8pxnish A= Ci-Ofkv# K &A? WoVrt:.

THE SEInIOR WRANGLAEm oF 1857.-We understand that Mr. Finch, who has this year received the hiRhest mathematical honours at Cambridge, is a native of Wigan, Lancashire, and received his education at the Grammar School of that place, under the tuition of the present head master, the Rev. S. Doria. Mr. Cowling, the late distingisheA member of the Northern Circuit, vwho took the same honours at Cambridge, was a native of the same town, and pursuled his studies preparatory to the UJniversity at the same school.
THE EARL oF HAREWooD.-Tlhe latest bulletin, which is as follows, is of a favourable character as to the state of the Earl of Harewood:-

LwEstPOOL, Feb. 5.-The " Black-Ball" clippership Lightning, Euwright master, belonging to Mesr'. James Baines and Co., took her departure hence for Melbourne to-day, with 400 passengers, besides a mail and a fael
cargo. The auxiliary screw steamship Great Britain is advertised to leave this port for the same destination on the 15th inst. She has been refitted and altered considerably so as to increase her sailing capacity, and a lifting apparatus has been applied to the screw.
LIFEBOATS.-LIVERPOOL, Feb. 5.-At the usual meeting of the Liverpool Dock committee, this afternoon, the Marine committee, reporting in reference to the Liverpool lifeboats, one of which recently capsized, when her crew were lost, recommended that measures should be taken to give them additional buoyancy. The report was received.
TEE WEATER AND THE PARHS.-Yesterday, at noon, there was a decided chango in the weather, but in spite of the thaw it appears by the official acoount that the number of skaters in Hyde Park alone was S,000. On Wednesday night there was a displav of fireworks on the Serpentine, and many persons, both men and women remaimed on the ice during a portion of the night. A man named James Edwards, of Wood-street, Chelsea, was founr
frozen under the ice yesterday morning. , Some minor injuries were sustained during the day from falls on the ice or immersions in the water. At 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon the thermometer in Hyde Park had risen to 360. Wind, S.W.
IS SMOKING INJURIOUS TO HEIEALTH ?-An interesting discussion is now going on in the Lancet upon the effects of smoking. The uso of tobacco has during the last halfcentury greatly increased in En gland, and has now become an almost universal practice. This question, in which the leading members of the medical profession are taking part, must not only greatly interest the public, but may very materially affect the revenue of this country, when it is mnown that the income derived from the consumption of tobacco was last year upwards of 32,192,9431., the duty on which was more than 5,220,000& This return is independent of cigars, which was about 150,0001. An able article on the tobacco question appears in tho Lancet of the present week by r. Solly, .RS.S, of St. Thomas's Hospital, which will be read with interest by all inveterate smokers.
THE NW Eunorx A-.D AAnmRicA SISEA& SHIPPInG CoMPANy.-A large transfer of steamship property has just been completed at Southampton, the fleet of vessels belonging to thelate General Screw Steam Shipping CompanyhavingbeenhandedovertotheEmopeuamandAden- can Steam Shipping Company, an equitabloand MaishAetory arngement bemg first made with the old shareholders of the former company. The vessels transferred a&I-the Argo, Calcutta, Queen of the South, Lady Jocelyn, H7dses, Indiana, Jason, and Golden Fleece. The ongin cost of these vessels was about 638,0rO1., and they have been purchased by the new company at 181. per ton, being about half their original value. The nominal purchase price of the fleet was 319,7501. They will, after being Properly fitted for sea, be perfectly adapted for tho peculiar trade in which they are to be employed. In celebration of the completion of the transfer, and to inaugurate the entry into possession of these steamships by the new
yom a splendid banquet was given by Messrs. =ey and Co. on board the Golden Fleece, at Southampton, yesterday, the chair being taken by Mr J. R. Croekey. The company included most of the leading gentlemen of Southampton connected with the shi ping, the docks, or the railway, and eminent commerciafgentlemen from London. The guests were about 100 in number. The toasts of "The Queen," and " The President of the United States" having been given, and duly honoured, others followed appropriate to the occasion, including "Success to the European and Amnerican Sinpping Comany,"t and "1 The Health of the Chairman and Directors." The latter toast was acknowledged by AIr. E. W. Crawford, who congratuated the company that these steamships had not been handed over either to French or Russian compani*e as was at one time anticipated. Mr. T. IL Weguelin gave "Prosperity to the great Steam Companies connected with Southampton, nan d they haddeserved well of the country for the services they had rendered during the late war. Captain Engledue returned thanks. The list of toasts having been completed, the London visitors returned by the o o'clock tram, and the company separated.
