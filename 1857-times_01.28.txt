Nauguration Of A New School Of Art In Sheffield.
NA UGURATION OF A ITZr I SCE OF
ART IY S'H@FFBIRLD. ;
Tbe opening of a new school of art ai M4eIda was ina *augiurated by a publH conversasioRC eV. Iouday evening.
The new building, which is pronotceed by competent I judges to be the most complete and commodious building of the kind in the kingdom, has been erected at a total cost of 7,1001. Towards this sum about 3,S00l. has been reised by subscriptions and donations, and 1,To0o. by a bazaar held ia
October last, leving a deficiency of 1,6001. yet to be pro | vided. The invitations to the opening were addressed more particularly to those who had subscribed towards the baild. ing, and to the ladies who had aided in the bazaar. The company includedthe principal merchants and manufac. turers of the town, with the ladies of their families, and was a very gay gathering. Mr. J. A. Roebuck, MLP. fcr Sheffield, was present, and addressed the company.
Mr. ROEBUCK said,-Ladies and Gentlemon,-We are met here to-night to celebrate, I think, a great event in the history of Sheffield. We are met to celebrato the erection of this building, -which, ia my opinion, marks the transition we are about to make in placing the every day avocations of life within the sphere of art. By so doing, we not only elevate the common transactions of life, but we add very much to our own happiness. I will explaia to you why I think this happens. It seems to me that ia the mere making of one's livelihood-the mere gathering together of the bread of life -there are usually attendant upon the ordinary affairs of life circumstances that are not agreeable to tbe elevation of our thoughts and feelings; but if we can makle that which is the daily habitude of our existence the means of raising our feelings and our thoughts, creating in us something that will elevate our feelings as men, we do much not merely to exalt our naturo but to increase eur ownhappiness. Believe me when I tell you that there is something in all that pertains to art of such a perennial and ever-flowing nature that it never palls upon the senses, that it never in any way diminishes in its power to exalt and bless humanity; and, therefore, if we make that the daily avocation of our lives, we do much to exalt the nature of man and to increase our own welfare. This may appear to you a somewhat fine-drawn and sentimental view of things; but I speak to you as a practical man, whose life has been pasced in the turmoil and boiling up-stirring springs of life; for my life has been that of one who hashadto combat with his fellow men, and I have found that that which has been to me the solace of rmy life has been art. Cheers.) For though I am an hum. ble pupil of art, stiU I am an adoring pupiL I love her for er goodness to me; I love her for her elevating influence upon the human race. (Cheers.) My life-I sPeak from my own experience to those whose lot is cast in a different sphere-my life has been one, as I have told you, of combat. The great business of my life has been to overcome opposition. If in that I had been left alone, deserted as it were, allowed to support myself by my own individual energy, I should have had nothing to support and solace me; but because it was my fate to have good instractors, those whom I love and reverence, and whose recollection I shall ever cherish, thoy raised in me the feeling that art was to me that which would render life cheerful and happy; and because they thus taught me I have passed away and forgotten the turmoil of life in that which to me has been the solace of life. And now I will point out to those for whom this building has been erected how that which has been to me a solace may be to them the same. I have fought with the obstacles of life; and working men, to whom I now apply myself, have the same thing in a different shape to contend with. They have to combat with the difficulties of their existence; and if that which is their daily toil-in which they spend their labour, anxiety and energy-wearies them, calls upon them daily and hourly for that which exhausts and destroys their powers, I would say to them, the hope and solace of their existenoe is in the verv school in wbich we are now assembled. I do not 6imply address myself as to the means which this society ofers to them of raising thema in their position in the world, though that 1I think ought not to be forgotten; but I would say to the working men, " You have here before you a proof that those who certain persons tell you are opposed to you, and have interests opposed to yours have come forward in the most munificent manner and have erected this building, not in their own behalf, tut for the instruction-the munificent instruction-of the people of this town." (Cheers.) And I would say to them that there is somethinginthe domain of art which not only exalts the mind, but whieh is ever permanent; and that among the beneficent dispensations of Providence is that the powers of the-mind generally fail after those of the body; that when the vigour and stimulus of youth have passed away and the energy of manhood hasworn out, the powers of the intellect remam, and the pleasures of the intellect remain also; and they who desire a cheap, everspringing, constant means of pleasure and solace in this life should betake themselves to the domain of art. I would say also that this building exhibits to us what I said in the beginnin -that we are about to approach
new era in the town of Sheffield, for this building has been raised mainly by the exertions of the manufacturing class of this town. And when I say that, I mean the mastsr manufacturers; and not only by the master manufactureas, but by the ladies who belong-if I may use such a phraseby the ladies who are their compn ons in life. Sorry am I to say it, that there has not that assistance given to the erection of this great building by the working classes which I had hoped and expected. But my expectations were based upon reasons which my experience oughttohave told me were baseless and unfounded. The working classei have been told that the manufacturing class (I mean the master manufacturers) have interests hostile to theirs, and that anything coming from them was to be looked upon with suspicion and jealousy. The answer made to that by this building is complete. What does this building show? It shows that there is foresight and generosity in the employers of labour; that they have not come herefor their own personal profit; but have said to themselves- and Icongratutlate them that they have made the discovery-that by elevating those whom they employ, they elevate themselves, and they elevate the country to which they belong. (Cheers.) But let me say that we-and in that I include myself-however humble, are deeply indebted to the ladies of this town. (Cheers*) They have enabled us-I beg pardon of the gentlemen for alysg myself, even in name, with them for that which they have done without my assistance, though it would have been given most cheerfully had it been askedbut still, speaking-of the ladies of the town, I say we owe them a deep debt of gratitude. Not to me surprising has been their conduct, for I have invariably found that iu the good race, in the race of humanity, the intelligence and kindness of my fellow.countrywomen have ever been foremost. (Cheers.) No man more than myself has reason to speak well of the sex. As the mother, as the wife, and as the daughter, I have known them; and in every condition of life they have been to me the greatest happiness and the greatest solace which life affords. (Cheers.) Therefore the conduct of the ladies of Sheffield in this matter is not to me surprising. But their conductis an index of the conduct of those with whom they live whom they love, and whom they cherish; and they have shown themselves foremost in raising this great building. They have shown themselves ready to aid and assist all that their husbands, brothers, and fathers designed, and they have been most effective in their aid; and m the name of this association I take leave to thank them most heartily for their assistance. (Cheers.) Now, ladies and gentlemen, having stated the era which I think we have commenced in Sheffield, and having stated also the circumstances very shortly-for I think that brevity is the soul of wit-under which this great building has been erected, I have little more to say to you, though what I could say might, indeed, be extended long into the hours of the night, because there is no end to the advantages which this institution holds out to the working classes, and to them I would now address miy'self. It is usually supposed that this building is iftended simply to advance what is called the manufactuirig iadustry of Sheffield. Now, I take leave to differ fromn that opinion. I believe that theobject of this institutionis to raiso and exalt the whole population. (Cheers.) And by so doing, by a consequence derivable from that, I believe it will benefit the manufacturing industry of Sheffield. How wi it do thies. By improving the taste of all. It is said that English art stands low in the world, that what youproduce, when taken abroad among those who are the purchasers, does not find that acceptance which those articles would obtain if they were manufactured on principles of art. In the great exhibitions of London and Paris I think there was some truth In this assertion. Wonderful as your feats have been, great as I believe your power is, there is something about the productions of English manufacture which is wanting. What is that something? It is that ennobling influence of which I have spoken, namely the influence of art. Now, I believe I am touching upon a matter somewhat unpopular h but it is not my habit to consult popularity. (Cheers analaughter.) The truth, however unpalatable i-
may be, some how or other finds in myself a very unworthy, but a very ready expostor. (Hear. Now, I believe that al that has distinguishedl Sheffield has been gre at energy, great
poer-the application of Wil to the subduing of narture. You have sent your goods over the whole face of the globe, I believe that some explorers have recently discovered in the very centre of Asia works in iron with the name of Sheffield thereon written. But in spite of that there has always been something that has operated as a drawback. What is that something? It is this-that you haveoconsulted anything but nature. You have consulted anything but the principles which ought to dictate to those who are working in any aTt, I do not care what may be its applhc t hei r to the erection of this building. or

(hes.) Ibelieve that the gentlemen who conduct this Mch C.O have in themselves great knowledge of this principile. I will not now-far be it from mne to do se-enter into sa-y metaphysical discussion with them or anybody; hut I eiv hre is at the bottom a well. ring by which allta sgreat in art is supplied. ,hose. principles they know; those principles they will impart to the Ilabouring population of this town, if that labouring population will come and receive them.

Wr. COLA, of tho Government departmet of science and art, expressed the satisfaction it had afforded him to be present at the opening of so noble a building, raised without one shillisg's aid from Government. Thecost, he understood, was near 7,5001., and of this 5,5001. had, been subsctibeod!in Sheffield. He urged that they should within the njit month provide the remaining 2,0001., so that they might commence free from debt. If they did nob do so they would in all probability place their representative in the disagreeable position of having to go to the Board of Trade to beg for a grant. He trusted they would themselves raise the money, and not place either themselves or their members in that situation. He remembered with much satis-aotion the high position which the pupils of the Sheffield school attained in the late competition for prize medals, and added that he re-retted that he could not produce tbe medals for distri'ation, an accident to one of the dies last week having prevented them being struck off. Hewould now say a few words in connexion with what Government was doing in order to assist schools of this description. ae had already told them that they were partly sauported out of the taxation of the country; and here be wound say that the rewards from the Government for excellence in art were not confined to schools like the present; but although at the same time there were from 60 to 70 schools of this description in the country the Government offered rewards to all persons who devote themselves to the study of art. The system which was already in action, but which had not fructified so much as they could wish in Sheffield, was this-that every man, woman, and child, whether full grown, half grown, or ceased to grow, if they could only draw straight lines and solve problems in geometry, might come up to one of those schools and receive a reward proportionate to his efficiency. He wished them, therefore, to understand that 3r. MIitchell was not only willing to look after the instruction of the pupils attending that school, but to give all the aid in his power to starting the children in the various parish schools in the town in the elements of art, which would enable them when they became artisans to aerive a higher instruction in such schools as this. For this purpose an inspector was sent round once a-year to Sheffield, Manchester, Birmingham, &c., to hold examinations of not only the pupils attending the schools regularly, but also of suc people as chose to present themsclves for examination in art. At the present time there were from 60 to 70 of those schools of art established throughout the country, and probably they would like to hear in what position Sheffield stood in relation to those other places. lie was afraid he was now coming to anunpopular part of the subject, and if they anticipatedhe was theyhad only to say so, and he would keep it a profound secret. (A laugh, and cries of "Go on. ) He might say that the Sheffield School of Art stood at the bead of all the schools in the country. (Hear, hear.) Ay, that was a sugarplum; now for a dose of bitterness. The Exeters oowas founded some two or three years ago, and, though the population of that town was only 40,000, the average number of students coming up there for examination from the various parish schools and schools of other denominations was no less than 835; and in the Exeter school of art there were, besides, 190 students. In Cheltenhamn, with a populaton of only 35,000, the number of ait students from al the schools is 1,350; in Chester they have 1,200 students from the public schools; and in Worcester nearly 500. But in Manchester, which was an old school, and where theie was a population of 300,000, he was sorry to say they had only 230 students from the parish schools. In Sheffield, he was afraid to say it. [Cries of " Say it, say it."] Well, could any one give a shrewd guess of what number of students a population of 135,000 should produce? He supposed that Sheffield was not behind in its number of children. (A laugh.) Taking the number of children that Sheffield ought to have-and no doubt it had that number-how many did they suppose were taking advantage of Mr. Mitchell's superintendence? He was almost ready to sink into the ground when he told them the number was only 18. The official returns would shortly be printed and published to the whole world. Leaving that part of the subject he went on to speak of the favourable character of the Sheffield School of Art, and stated that while the highest number of medals awardei in one year to any school was 30, the students in the Sheffield School of Art were about to receive that night 28, or rather they were not about to receive these, though they were entitled t them, in consequence of the die of the reverse side having broken in striking it. He observed, in passing, that there was a peculiarity about the medals this year which had never been known before. There had generally been some Latin inscription upon them, such as " Victoria, Dei gratia, Regina. Fid. Def.' Tbis time they had ventured to put on a plain English inscription, which was simply "Victoria, by the grace of God, Qneen." He then went on to say that the whole of the works of art for which those medals were given throughout the country it was intended to bring togetherinto one exhibition, and thatinord6r that they might not be thought too metropolitan it had been determined that those exhibitions should be held in the pro. vinces, and he was happy to see that in this school they had a room so well calculated to serve for such an exhibition of the fine arts. Next year it was intended that the students' works of art should be exhibited in Manchester, and to award for the best types of art 100 of what they were going to call national medals, To get a medal worthy of such an occasion they had sought all over Europe for an artist, and they had succeeded in obtining the services of a foreign gentleman of great celebrity (whose name the speaker mentioned, but it was not caught by the reporter). Each of these medals would represent 101., for which the student would receive a work of art equal in value to that amount. The speaker then exhibited one or two specimens of the works of art intended to be given to such students as gained the national medals Some of these were in electrotype, copied from very celebrated works of art in the Louvre, aris, and frorm other French museums of art. These he pointed out as encouragements for the students2 and went on to say, in conclusion, that the interference in assisting the people in the study of the fine arts was an interference perfectly justifiable. (The speaker resumed his seat amid applause.)
Mr. RoEBucx,-Before I proceed to perform the rest of my duty I beg to ssure my hon. friend Mr. Cole that in me he will find a person not at all likely to bnUy him, and certainly not a person that is likel to implore him to do anything for the peple of Sheffield. (Laughter.) I believe thatthe people or Sheffield are able to do for themselves what their ownv interests require, for their own interests have pointed out to thom-and when I use the word interest, I mean an enlightened int,"est-a high and ennobling conception of their position in scciety and in the world-their interests have pointed out to them the necessity for such a building as this. My hon. friend has told you that in that they have not received any aid from Government. The only thing which Government had to do was to provide those medals, andathat has not been done. (Laughter.) I must say that that has rnos surprised me. (Laughter.) I knowv something of Government, and Iam not astonished at any failure in that quarter. (Laughter and cheers.) Mr. Roebuck then proceeded to announce the pries, and expressed his regret that he could not distribute the medals.
On the motion of Dr. BnA_Nso?r, seconded by Mr. J. W. PYn SNUTH (the Mayor), a cordial vote of thanks was awarded to Mr. Roebuck for his services in the chair.
Mr. RoimucKL-Instead of owing me thanks I owe you thanks. I always say of my constituents at Sheffield that they are a peculiar constitueeny so far as I am concerned, for the only thing they require me to do is to come once a-year among them to eat a good dinner. (Laughter.) Bnt upon this occasion you have asked me to come to preside over a still better thig than a good dinner-namejy, the inauguration of a great means for elevating the species to which you belong, and doing great good to the town of which you are part. That has been a part of my duty that I most cheerfuly, most gratefully acceded to and if at any time you can make me usefu, you wil find me also grateful in being made applcable to the interests of the town which I have the honour to represent. Believe me when I say that I owe to you not merely the gratification of appearing as I now appear among you; but yot have given me the power, if I know how to exercise it of doing great good, not only to you but to the country of which you formi a part. For that honour I thank you; for that honour I have striven and I will strive, and to deserve
our approbation is the great object for wbich I work. That have deserved it, you yourselves upon this occasion have testified, and for that Ithank you. (Cheers.)
The company then separated.

Sir -The following remarks occur in MIsr. Roebuck's speech at the above meeting, as reported in the columns of Thle Tisses on Satuxrday last :
" I know that real honest and distinguished mercantile houses refused to have anything to do with Government contracts because they were obliged to preface their proceedings by bribing the departments."
2-ow, Sir, this wholesale chargo of bribery and collusion against those who have not " refused to have anythng to do with Governmnent contracts," we feel we cannot allow to pass without entering our protest against such an attack, by stating that, during the many yeas we have been contractors to the Government, in its various departments, nothing ever ap* ared that could for a mioment warrant the offer o a subsidy, in any shape or way, to any person connected with those establishments * and therefore, without vishing to advance any opinion o'n the genera -views expressed at the above meeting, we regret that Mr. Roebuck should have committed himself to an assertion invested with aR the apparent force of actual knowledge-.so unmeasured in its attack, and so general in its application-which our personal observation and experience comvince us is unjustifiable,

Repression Of Crime.
'. BgpRBsIONr OF CRIME.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIHES.
Sir,-The pablic is much indebted to you for the discussion to which you have opened your columns on the subjeet of transportation. I believe, however, that some ingenuity has been wasted in seeking for new places, It is needless to have recourse to. burning or freezing climates, or to stormy or barren islands, which yield no subsistence, for the sirnple reason that there is already a healthy colony, abounding in minerals and timber, and including many corn-growing tracts, the inhabitants of which have for some years steadily demanded a supply of convicts. Such a country is Western Australia, and it will amply serve to meet the immediate difficulty.
But it must be admitted that those who have most studied the question believe that transportation cannot be a permanent resource. They say that the evils which it generates are too great to be endurable. Without dwelling on this, the point to which I am anxious to draw attention is that it can never be stfflcimt. It has the immense convenience of getting rid of the old offenders, whose reappearance is so annoying, but let no one flatter himseli that transportation in modern dayswill discouraae the commission of crime. The root of the evil i England is that we have ceased to have any truly decterring punishment, and no effcotual or lasting good is tobe accomplished without something very like a revision of our whole penal code.
Every one knows that the first element of a good criminal code must be that for each advancing step in guilt the offender should feel that he incurs an increased punishment, so that the law should dispute every inch of ground with him, and continually repel him with penalties growing in proportion to his own audacity. There ought to be a tariff of crime and punishment, the one proportioned to the other, with which every citizen can be familiar. In this country we have no scale of punishments. We can have no scale of punishments without a classification of offences, and this last, we are told, is the most difficult of tasks-so difficult that when it was attempted a few yeara ago by men learned in the law their efforts were soon turned into derision by the judges. In the meanwhile, our sole penalty for crimes less than capital being imprisonment and labour, the only mode of adding to punishment is in duration. There is said to be at this moment in one of the penal settlements a man who is under 45 years' cumulative sentences, so that for his next offence he must wait to be punished until the year 1900; a fact on which he does not fail to comment with suitable glee. Can anything better illustrate the helplessness of the law as it stands ?
The fact is that after once a man has broken the law, and incurred a certain penalty, the deeper he advances in guilt the longer must the retribution be postponed. Can we be surprised that crime should spread under such a condition? Surely it proves the necessity first of attempting to devise some sharper and more prompt punishment, and, secondly of grappling with the difficult but not impossible task of importing some more system and logic into our penal code.
Punishment, Sir, is pain, and pain must be either physical or moral, and, all things considered, I am drivento ask myself whether if a man, besides brealkng into my house to-night, for whieh he Might possibly get six or seven years' penal servitude, were to half strangle me besides, it would do any harm to the community that, instead of receiving two or three years' more imprisonment seven years hence, he should be wel flogged next week. He might be degraded, I am told,-a thing of which the possibility may admit of question; but at all events my throat and those of my neighbours would be considerably safer than when the only motive addressed to a criminals forbearance is to take effect after a long term of years.
Send away your offenders by all means until you have time to amend your criminal law, but do not forget that, besides getting rid of criminals, it is desirable to repress crime; and that this can never be effected without an intelligible definition of offences and a rational graduation of punishments, both of which are at this moment wholly wanting in England.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

Sir,-A slight shock of earthquake was felt both here and at Highfield-house yesterday afternoon at 3h. 20m. There was a noise like a distant heavy luggage train and a trembling of the ground, producing a peculiar sensation on the soles of the foot. The earthquake pendulum moved from west to east. The pendulum is 33 feet in length, and the movexnent was scarcely the eighth of an inch.
I have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servant,

JoLLiTY OF ENGOLu HIGH LTFE.-The following pleasant peep at English domestic life is extracted from a letter written by an officer of the Merrimac frigate, when she lay at Southampton, in October. We find it in the Washington (N.C.) Journal : - "Much attention has been paid us ashore, too, especiaUy by two families -one, that of an old East India general, the other that of Lord Hardwicke. General Frazier has passed most of his life in India, and now lives in ease and comfort on the Southampton Water. At a dinner at his house we had an opportunty of seeinho the aristocracy here live. Lord Hardwicke and family and several other guests were there to meet us, and everything was in splendid style. One turbaned Indiau, with several other servants, waited at table. The plate was superb and the dinner the most recherch& WVe sat down to table at half-past 7 o'clock. These are always epaulette and sword occasions. Lard Hardwicke's family consists of his Countess, his eldest son (about 18 or 20, and Lord Royston by courtesy), three of the finest looking daughters you ever saw, and several younger rons. The daughters-Lady Elizabeth, Lady Mary, and Lady Agnita-are surpassingly beautiful; such development, such rosy cheeks, laughing eyes, and unaffected manners you rarely see combined. They take a great deal of out-door exercise, and carco aboard the Merrimac in a heavy rain, with Irish thicker-soled shoes than you, or I ever wore, and cloaks and dresees almost impervious to wet. They steer their father's yacht, walk the Lord knows how many miles, and don't care a centaboutrain. besides doing a host of otber things that would sbock our ladies to death; and yet in the parlour they are the most elegant women in their satin shoes and diamonds I ever saw. The Countess, in lier coronet of jewels, is an elegant lady, and looks like a fit mother for three such women. Hi Lrdship has given us three or four dinners.

The Slave Troubles In Tennessee.
I TiHB rLJAE TROp LES 12 TBIVNESSEE.
T1.e Clarksville (Tennse6) Jefferoh=iau publishe-
the. followino, resolutionsMopted by the Committee Qt Safety which was appointed in that place to investigate the causes of the rcient negro troubles, and to suggest a remedyg-;
" The committee appointed by the cittizes oE Clarksville to investigate the trth of the threatened insurrection of the negroes in this vicinity, to allay improper excitemeut, and to guard the community against danger, deem it appropriate to the occasion that we should give publicity to the following resolutions, which have mst our unanimous approval, and we recommend them as precautionary mea. sures, which, if followed, will, in our opinion, avert every danger and give perfect security to thefitizens:-
" Resolved,-That we recommend to our city and county authorities to suppress for the fxture all assemblages of negroes, under any pretext whatever, at frolics, balls, benevolent societies, or at publio worships where negro
preachers offloiate; and that our ministers of the! Gospel be requested to asupend absolately their habit of preaching to the negroes on occasions soearate from their ordinary preaching as ministers of the Gospel. Ourcharches are large enough for our whole population, white and black. We deem all such meetings for negro preaching alone improper; that they degenerate into unlawf ul assemblies, and are otherwise productive of incalculable mischief.
" That the owners of negroes ought not to give orders for their negroes to get buggies and carriages for pleasure on the Sabbath, or on any occasion whatever, and that it Is tho sense of this committee that the owners of livery stables in Clarksville ought not to hire horses and buggies to negroes, even when their masters permit it, for the reason that sudh indulgence to negroes promotes insubordination among the slaves, and stimulates feelings whoUy inconsistent with their duty to their masters and the subordinate position they should occupy in reference to white people. It is further the sense of this committee that our merchants and traders ought to abstain absolutely from dealing with the negroes, nnless by the express permission of their masters; and on no account ought they to sel them firearms, ammunition, or other weapons, with or without their owners' consent, if any should be so indiscreet as to grant it.
"That, in the opinion of this committee, the present evilsthat affectusare mainly to be attributed to the late Presidential canvass, not meaning to cast nore blame on this than on thatpolitical party; we condemn the pablic discasaion of aU questions touching negro slavery, before crowvds of people, in the hearing of vast multitudes of negroes. We further think slaveholders are guilty of gross folly when they permit their negroes to go to barbecues and other public gatherings, where publc speakers of the one party or the other discuss those delicate subjects of negro slavery, the true bearing of which they do not comprehend, and where they imbibe crude and disjoiated notions of freedom, which only imperil the safety of the white and the certain destruction of the black race.
That we call upon our city authorities to take strong measures to prevent negroes passing to and from the Ironworks, from spending Christmas holydays in our town, and especially from staying a single night in the corporation, unless their masters reside here. In case, however, a negro's wife lives in town, he will be permitted to sty hero, provided he has a pass from his master, which 1s recognized or endorsed by the o;wner of his wife, and that they increase the day and night watch in each ward In the city during this period, at the expense of the corporation. We further earnestly recommend to our whole population in the town and coanty to abolish the usage of giving to their servants Christmas holydays. It is a usage more honoured in the breach than the observance, for the reason that it breeds idleness and encourages dissipa. tion among the negroes, impairs their health, and corrupts their morals. It would be a blessing to them to be kept constantly employed, as a protection against the evils engendered by idleness, and a decided comfort to us, as affordingexemptionagainstthepettylarcenies and tho bacchanalian broils that always disgrace the Christmas week, during which time we hope additional pains wiU be bestowed by our citizens to prevent negroes from getting whisky, and that all saloons and liquor shops be closed till after New Year if not for ever.
"That, though the committee may adjourn from day to day, it wil not disband tiU we are sure the community are safe from the troubles that caused our organization, and to secure this end we Invoke the aid of our city authorities, the strong arm of the law, and the sincere co-operation of all good citizens.
"That we advise the people of every civil district in the country to organize a Vigilant Patrol of 20 men under the command of a captain, who by turns shali patrol their respectivo districts by day and night until the present excitement is allayed. By these precautionary measures we seek to create no alarm, but to allay it, and if this advice is foUowed all danger wiU ba averted. In caution there is safety.
"For the future negroes shall not be permitted to hiro their own time, as it is caled, under any pretext whatever, or be suffered to remain in town if it is attempted, and wa pledge ourselves to enforceo the law against all persons who, in this respect, shall attempt to evade it. The evils growing out of such practices are too grave to be tolerated any longer, nor wiU it bs permitted that captains or other officers of steamboats shall hire negroes at night about the town, to assist in loading and unloading their boats at the wharf or landing, except they have the written permission of their masters. The negroes invariably return to their masters next day, if not drunk, broken down and unfit for service.
"1 That we recommend in the appointment of patrol in the town and country that the strictest attention be paid to the selection of men of character and prudence, and that masters be requested to keep their negroes upon their own Premises as much as possible til the excitement in the public mind is alDayed, and thas aswell to prevent the destruction of the slaves by imprudent men as to prevent combination and concert on the part of the slaves, should they entertain any improper design.

CORRUPTION IN CONGRESS.-We trust that the
ConunoxiN COGREss W.-eW trust that the committee appointed to investigate the charges of corrup. tion in the House of Representatives wiU discharge its duties fearlessly. The character which has attached itself, either justly or unjustly, to a portion of our national legislators is one which we Would rejoico to have proved unfounded; we do not want it glossed over, or left in any doubt. As regards the present charge there can be no middle course, and the evidence must either sustain it or prove it utterly worthless. The alleged venality of a nnmber of members of Congress is such that, the moment any bil is introduced involving a large grant of land or money,the first impression which strikes almost every person is that some of the advocates of this biU have been amply rewarded for their services. In fact, it is said no one now undertakes to -have a bill passed unless he has largely paid a certaia number of the "lobby" for the influence which, it is said, they can exert upon certain member. This done, an arrangement is afterwards to be made with these members, or with the brokers in their behalf. Now, if such a state of affairs does exist, it is weU that the people should kuow it from good authority. The pay of the membereis qaite adequate for the duties of their offlce, and there is not tho least necessity for peculation. If the test of the success of abill is not its merits, but the amount of black mail which can be levied, then the sooner this is proclaimed the better. The whole lobby business is one which should be discountenauced, as not only disgraceful in itself, bat as also involving the character of Congress. Many a member wben applied to for his suppr by these lobbymen gives his assent, unconscious that his voteilw be sold. His cbaracteris thusinjured, andhefor whose benefit the vote has been obtained is treated unjustly. By the adoption of the recent resolutions an opportunity is offered for denouncing this system and 'aking measures vwhich may tend to induce members to repulse any offer which shaU be made to secure their votes by appealing to their interest. The large railroad grants which were made by the present Congress are regarded by thle people a3 having been secured by purchased votes, and cif the charge3 in regard to the Minnesota biU be sustained their conclusion Wmill ppear to have been a just one. We may safely affirin that there is no Government the members of which are individually unapproachable, but we believe that our own
Government has acquired the reputation of being one more open to outside influence, owing to its popular element than that of any other country. As to the results of the present investiration, we fear that tboy will not be very satisfactory. It is now believed that the proposition to Mr. Payne was made in joke, and we suspect it
will be no easy matter to convict xiy of having bden" bribed. Those who are guilty, if any there be, will have been wise enough to provide against being caught, and it is not probable that any one will become States' evidence. As to those members who deesued it fit to open their vials of wrath upon the public press, wo can assure them that they have only placed themselveo in a ridiculous position, and exhibited a want of common sense which proves them unworthy of their position. With but few exceptions, the press of our countrv is, we may tafely say, incorruptible and independent. It is regared by the people as one of their safeguards. and toit most of our legis. lators owe their advancement. Right glad are they when they can secure its influence, and those who willingly attack3 it and its conductors, when assertions are made which do not pleaso them, only prove that tbey aetknowledge its power. Wlere the press to ignore tha procceding. of Con.. gress the people would b%ve- enough cause oi complaint,; and it is through the very publicity which is given by means of correspondents and "pevny-a-liners" that many a rogue s forced to act as an honesbinanu. If the present investig&;.c tion shall lead to any prs4tical result, the people will knot through what means 3t was attained, and thnse who iZ indignantly shot their arrows at the pres; willfind theirebounding into their own vitnls.-24n Fobl CVorier nnr ,Enqjiurcr.

THE PUB1UO IIEALT g.
MFrom the Registrar.Generalls Weekly Return.)
The deaths rogistered in Laidon, which in the two pre; vious weeks had been 1,135 and 1,171, roao ia the week tUib ended last Saturday to 1,216. In tho 10 years 1847-56 the average number of deaths in the weeks corresponding with last week was 1,177. But if the deaths of last week are lo be compared with the average, tho latter should he raWssi
proportioalUy to the inerease of population, in which cara it wiU become 1,295. Henco it will be seen that althorigh the rate of mortality has been rising lately, it is etill below the averago.
In comparing the results of the last two weeks an increase is observed in the deaths of old persons; for whereas 41 men and women, who had attained the age of 80 years or un. wards, died in the former woek, the number lastwoeek*is 74. In these 74 old persons an unusual number of nonagenta rians is fonnd, namely, 14; a man and a woman were ecb 95 years of age, and the two oldest were women who hal. reached the &ge of 96 years.
In the present as compared with the previous return thre, is an increase in zymotic diseases, and also in diseases of the nervous system and the heart, whilo the nunbers referreX to pulmonary complaints are almost identical, and deaths
by phthisis (or consumption) decreased from 152 to 135. Thej~ increase in the class first mentioned arises altogether fromz hooping.coughandtyphus (which includescommonfever), thle cases In whichthe former was fatal havingincreasodfrom55to, 67, and those oo the latter from 34 to 52. Six children died of hooping-cough in the sub-district of St. Margaret, West. minster, and three of these in the same house, viz., 2, Church-court. Three men died of "febris" on the 21st, 22d, and 23d inst. respectively irk the workhouse, Mile-ens New-town. Measles was fatal last week in 26 cas(j Th.s. complaint appears to have prevailed in the NorwaR worli. house, as four young children died there from it betweeza the llth and 17th January. A musician, who resides at 117, Lillington-street, Westminster, has lately lost all his children (four daughters) from measlcs.
Three persons died of carbuncle. The deaths of five persons are recorded in the present retram as caused bf intemperarce.
Last week the births of 901 boys and 885 girls, in alt 1,789 children, were registered in Lnndon. In the tent corresponding weeks of the years 1847-56 the average numhbewas 1553.
At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mnean height. of the barometer in the week was 29.547 in. The highest reading was 30-20 in. at the beginning of the week; the lowest 28-97 in. on Saturday. The mean temperature of the week was 38'10, which is 1° above the average of the samr
week in 43 years (as determined by Mr. Glaishier.) The highest temperature occurred on Sunday (the 18th). and' was 49 8; the lowest was 28.4°, which occurred en Thurs. day; the range of the week was 21.40. The mean dewpoint temperature was 36-1°, and the difference betweem this and the mean air temperature was 2°. The mesat temperature of the water of the Thames was 39 40. The temperature of the river was remarkably constant. The wind blew generally from the west. Its horizontal move. ment varied from 15 miles on Wednesday to 165 on Friday. Rain feU to tho amount of 0-41 in., more than half of' which fell on Tuesday. Rain fell on every day, except Wednesday.

BMPLOYEBS AND TVOERs
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I amn a clergyman and a schoolmaster. In the one capacity I am in the habit of preaching to congregations, varying in number from 500 to 1,500- tin the other, of lec. turing classes of from 5 to 50 boys. i confess I should like for once to reckon my hearers by thousands rather than by units, and I know of no one but yourself who can furnsb_ mo with class or congregation on such a scale.
For I cannot afford to wait till I can say my may to"benevolent readers" or " an intelligent public," when m_t sermon-beU has been kept ringing by the space of half s year in your advertisement columns. My sermon, such as it is, is for day; my "Tract for 'the Times"' now passing; and, unless you will give it curency, it must g. the way of many a letter before it, and feed the 'dames of editorial fires.
But enough of this strain. My real reason for writing to you is this-that I believe I have something to say which may be of use "in this present distress," and that a word of assent from you wil give circulation to what I have to say from one end of tho land to another-v;ill find admissjiton fbor it cin aldmost every quarter in which I could most wish
I would say a few words upon a subject which you hava yourself suggested-that of the remedy to be found for tles present denciency of employment. I refer to a leading article of a few days since, in which you advocated Goverm. ment works on a large scale. I wiU not enter into a discussion of that suggestion. If such a discussion should be necessay there are others better qualified to enter upon it than I am. In the few words I have to say I would rather build up on the foundation yoa have laid than waste tir-
and energy, and other people's patience, in attemp'ing to pull down what other men have built.
And first, as to the reality of the deficiency in questionv This comes home to my knowlodge in many ways, as to that of most men, I doubt not, whose circumstances info
them, or who care to inform themselves, of the real state r E things in their owvn neighbourhood. As I have a few acres of land in my own occupation I am brought into communi. cation with a great variety of persons in one way or other, and I could not shut my eyes to this if I would, and I am far from desring to do so. Labourers of all kinds have the same tale to tell-"- Never knew work so slack as it is now." One man, an agricultaral labourer, with whom I walked and conversed on my way home the other day, went at once in mediam rem " I never see'd such a sight as I saw just. now foras longas I'velived-never.Ishould think there were 70 or 80 poor chaps had up there before the m trates s I was coming through S-just now, and it's long of no work andstarxvig. I couldn't help pitying on 'em."
But on the other hand, I feel no hesitation in saying. that there are many who might retrench in other ways; so retrench as to make the incidence of their altered expendic. ture touch upon a class who can bear a temporary prcssure with little or no difficulty, and avoid that of the agricultural labourer, the bricklayer, and the carpenter, who have littleU power, any of them-some none, of tiding over a period of unusual pressure. There are many persons I am sure ix evey neighbourhood, who, when the facts of the case ale put before them, will gladly apply a remedy according totheir power; who only need to be reminded that at a time such as this, every additional pair of hands set to work at fair wages for a few weeks means a whole family saved from the pressure of grievous want; or the removal of a bittertemptation, hearbreaking and humiliating evan in, thought, from some young man or young woman, their brother and sister in Christ-need only this to induce them to make a vigorous effort to meet the evil.
" rve been out of work myself this ten weefs, so I knowe. what it is. Thank God ! I've never broke the laws to my knowledge, and I hope I never shall, brut I know what it is to have an empty belly and not knowhow to fill it; and it is hard to hear ones children crying for bread, and them none to give 'em."
Igouptom own field the next day, and itsthe sune story. *' We., P-, I hear that there are a great many men out of work all about just now. Is that so 1" " Yot! may woll say that, Sir; I never knew work so slack. It'st very hard upon a man to be out of work so many weeks together, particular if he has a wife and children to think. of as well as himself. It's enough to make a man rob, or anythink."1
And go all round, it's still the same-" Never was work," or " Never was trade so slack ;" and the same sad commentr, " It's very hard to want for bread and not know whero to get it. " And all this; I should say, I bave heard in most cases, notfrom those who were themselves out of work, and so srkeby way of moving my sympathy for themselves, but roms men who, though employed themselves, knew what others were suffering and felt for them.
Thus much for the fact. But where shall we look for a. remedy ? I answer, in a little well-judged but determined extravagance on the part of the einployers of labouz throughout the country. I say this idvisedly, and with: referenee only to present needs, and I will endeavour, as briefly as possible, to explain and enforce my meanng.
And in the first place, when an evil is to be remedied, wef shall generally do well to begin, if possible, by ascertaining: its cause. That cause, in the case before us, is very patent
-vz., this-that the persons who in various ways generAllyhave work to be done in such a season as this, when theweather is unusually favourable for alU sorts of outdoor work-for building, and so on-that these persons, I say, arefeeling apressure upon their pursesmand contracting their expenditure accordingly, especially in thoso things which. are not absolutely necessary to the continuance of their
usual habits, and which can be most easily tided over to a: more convenient season. Nothing can ba moro proper, abstractedly, than such a course ; and to many, Ihave no doubt, at the present time, not only abstractedly, but absolutely, right.
I would say, then, to the various persons who are usuallemployers of labour, see if you cannot make a little Wol
Just now. Has not the squire u at tbo hal some outhouses to be built or repaired, some additional fruit-wall to be constructed which he had intended deferring till the next rents camie in, but which he can very well do now, if he will o -1
not buy that " charming Turner" on which he hai set his. heart, and.which is for sale at Christie's next week? Or his brother-in-law at the rectory-is there not a part of his. glebo which would be all the better for "trenching" or "ridging up" just now? I am quite sure that his crop of potatoes would amply repay the expenditure-probabl by a greatly increased produce, cortainly by the quality of thee potatoes themselves, which as he eats of them will suggestthoughts of deserving labourers saved froma the workhouse or the gaol, of young men and young women saved from crime and sin, of hungering children fed, of weeping mothers comforted. He will have probably to retrench in some other way. Ho must put off the porchaseof that quarter-cask of sherry rwhich he had thonght or ordering, or be content to go on a littlo longer withoutl that temptng copy of St. Augustine :which he saw atParker'sswhen he was last at Oxford, and whinb_ h had promised himself out of his next tithes; but neithPowelU nor Parkef will havd to close their hou,se if he de ts bothl one and the other till lhidsummer or Mlichaelnmas- aondaBS neither boak-shelves nor cellar are empty as its, iii sermons will riot be the less orthodox, nor his welcome to bis. neighbours the less hospitable in the meantime. .
But Iam-going on further and faster thanIIhad inteaded,and'i Ido not take care my sermon will not evens bavc the iieritof being short. There are otheraspects. howevesr, of this same question which I would gladly. toauha

Tnesdsy Evenlng.
The quotation of gold atYaris is about 6 per mille premium, and theshortexchangeonLondon is 25.20 per 11. sterling. On comparing these rates with the English Mint price of 3l. 17s. 10Ad. per ounce for, standard gold, it appears that gold is nearly 5-lOths per cent. dearer in Paris than in London.
By advices from Hamburg the price of gold is 423 per mark, and the short exchange on London iB 13.21 per 11. sterling. Standard gold at the English Mint price is therefore about 6-lOths per cent. dearer in Eamburg than in London.
The course of exchange at New York on London for bills at 60 days' sight is 108g per cent., which, as compared with'the Mint par between the two countries, shows that the exchange is against England. But, after making allowance for charges of transport and difference of interest, the present rate leaves no profit on the transmiission of gold either way between the two countries.
The English funds continue to exhibit heaviness, and have closed at a further decline of a quarter per cent., chiefly owing to the knowledge of an active demand for money having prevailed at the Blank, and the expectation that if this should continue for a day or two an advance in the rate of discount will be decided upon. Consols for money were first quoted 9OS to i, and the last official transactions were at 93i to J for money, and 93g to i for the account. For the new account on the 5th of March they left off at 931 to 94. After regular hours some transactions took place at a fractional improvement. The dulness of the market was increased by the absence of any signs of recovery on the Paris Bourse, but on the other hand some support was afforded by the reduction in the cornmarket, by a tendency on the part of some of the Continental banks to return to easier rates of discount, and by an impression that an effort will be made by the EuropeanPowers to diminish their military expenses. Bank Stock left off at 216 to 217i; Reduced, 932 to -; New Three per Cents., 931 to 94; India Stock, 219 to 221; Exchequer-bonds, 98-1 to 991; and India-bonds and Exchequer-bills, 2s. discount to 2s. premium.
Foreign securities were steady, but in some cases. there was a tendency to weakness. In Turkish Six per Cents. the operations were at 941, i, and J for the account; and in the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, at 103i for the account. The general busi ness comprised-Brazilian Five per Cents., 101; Peruvian, for the account, 78i ; Portuouese Three per Cents., for the account, 44k and I; Russian Five per Cents., 108I, i, and kI; the Four-and-aHalf per Cents., 96i; Spanish Three per Cents., for the account, 40, and 40i ; the New Deferred, for account, 23i and #; Venezuela, for account, 36i; and Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 641.
In the foreign exchanges this afternoon there was an improvement in therates uponViennaandTrieste. With regard to other places no particular variation occurred from last post.
The closing quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. 60c. for money, and 67f. 55c. for the end of the month, showing a further fall of an eighth. At Vienna an improvement has occurred in consequence of the contemplated reduction in the Austrian army announced yesterday.
A further sum of 20,0001. in gold was taken from the Bank to-day for exportation.
The Bank of Holland have reduced their rate of discount from 4 per cent., at which it was fixed on the 8th of December, to 5 per cent.
The prospectus has been issued of a guaranteed Tuscan railway of 75 miles, from Florence to the Roman States, to be called the Ferdinand Railway. The capital is to be 800,0001., of which 200,0001. is offered in London in 201. shares, and the concession is for 99 years, with a guarantee equal to 5 per cent. from the Government, with whom any surplus profits beyond 8 per cent. are to be divided. The line will connect the Lombardo-Venetian network with those proposed to be constructed to Ancona, Civita Vecehia, Rome, and Naples.
The most important point in the commercial news from America this week is the repudiation of the greater part of the public debt of the State of California. This debt amounts to 600,0001., and a considerable portion of it is held in Europe. For some time there had been a disposition to question its legality, and, the matter having been brought before the Supreme Court of the State, judgment has been given that the bonds are unconstitutional and void. According to the State Constitution, the Legislature were prohibited from contracting any liabilities exceeding, in the aggregate, 60,0001., but the people and all. the authorities have subsequently ignored this provision, and aulowed loans to be negotiated which have reached to five times that sum. Upon the subject being at length brought before the Court it seems no other decision could have been arrived at. No blame therefore can be thrown upon the judges, and it is upon the people at large, as well as upon every officer of the executive Government, that the disgrace must fill if any advantage should be taken of it. According to the newspapers and private letters there is reason to anticipate that a law will be passed to recognize the entire amount; but this feeling is not unanimous, the ,Sacrament,o Times nd one or two other journals being disposed to take the opposite ground. In concluding their judgment the Supreme Court expressed a hope that the Legislature will declare the debt to be valid at their approaching session, make the necessary appropriations for the interest, and submit their proceedings to the people for ratification at the next general election in September. Their only objectionable remark was, that the holders had come into possession of the bonds with the full knowledge of their worthlessness. The fact of their curreney at San Francisco and New York is evidence to the contrary, and under no circumstances can it be supposed that the European purchasers had any idea of the technicality by which their claims could be vitiated. They knew that the State took the value of them, and they did not pause to inquire w,hether, through the agency of its own- courts, it could subsequently escape from its obligations.
In consequence of the desire expressed by some of the holders of Venezuelan bends, that a definite arrangement should forthwith be made 'with the commissioners sent here for that purpose by the Venezuelan Government, the Committee of SpanishAmerican Bondholders have held several meetings with the persons most largely interested in that stock; and a thorough understanding has been arrived at as to the terms of an equitable settlement. All parties being agreed, the Committee of SpanishAmerican Bondholders invited Senor Urbaneta, one of the commissioners, to meet them this aftermoon, requesting at the same time the attendance of several of the bondholders; and after a long discussion a final agreement was adopted, which seems likely to be satisfactory to all parties, supposing the conditions to be scrupulously observed. This agreement will have to be ratified by the Venezuelan Congress, and also to be accepted by the body of bondholders specially convened for the purpose. The following are its principal points as embodied in the document signed to-day :-The arrears of dividend to be capitalized, and bear 3 per cent. interest tiU 1862-4 per cent. afterwards. The active stock to receive 3 per cent. till 1867; and 4 per cent. afterwards. The deferred to have 1 per cent. tiU 1862, 11 for the next five years, and 2 per cent. after 1867; 25 per cent, of the Customs'
revenues of the Republic to be paid to special agents there, and remitted to Messrs. Frederick Hluth and Co., for payment of the dividends. If not sufficient, the amount to be made up by the Governmnent; if in excess of the required amount, the balance to be returned to the Government until 1867; after that date to beapplied in totality to as1ninfund. All these arrangements to take place as son as possible, and new bonds to be issued mn conformity wfith them in exchange for the present bonds. It is stated thattthe meeting of bondholders to which this agree. ment will be submitted for approval is to be held on an early day of the ensuing week.

The E nglish and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company have declared their divndend to-day at L iverpool for the peat half-year At the rate of 6 per cent. per annum, free of Income-tax.
The Ontario, Slmcoe, ansd HIuron Railway Cornpany of pper Canada have failed to remnit the halfyearly dinidend on their debentures, due the 1at of January, usually paid through the Commercial Bank of London. It seems that the secretar y wrote from Toronto to that eetablishi~ent in the early part of£December desirig that the dividend might be advertised, and that no communication of any kind has since reached' them. It transpired at the begin. snig of laatyearthat th vompany had surlreptitiously'
issued preferential bonds, so that aItogether theig coiaiidt is calculated to destroy confidence.

THE REPEAL OF THE HOP DUTY.-We understand
THE RrEnEi oF THE Hop Dury.-We understand that in compliance with the resolutions passed at the last Hop Duty meeting, held at Robertsbridge, the committee a ppointed at that meeting have applied to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, soliciting an interview on the subject of the hop duty, and that an answer has been received from the right hon. gentleman fixing an early day next week to receive a deputation. While on this subject we cannot refrain from alluding to a letter recently addressed by Mr. C. E. Frewen, M.P., to the hop planters of West Kent, in which, in referring to the coming election in that county, he says he considers this-to be " the most fittingtbneforthe electors to return a representative to Parliament who will advocate the removal of that unjust impost, the hop duty." We regret, however, to find the hon. member adding his impression, that "if West Kent declares in favour of retaining this tax it is quite useless for any Sussex member to move for its repeal, as we are sure to be told by the Chancellor of theExchequer that, as the Kertplanter donot wish for the removal of the tax, he cannot consent to give it up when there is so much difference of opinion among the planters themselves." N~ow, we do not dispute the probability of the Chancelor seeking to take advantage of the differences among the planters. But we do emphaticaUy deny the proposition of Mr. Frewen that becau.-s of those differencs it is useless for a Sussex member to move for the repeal of the duty. So far from the opposition of the West Kent planters being fatal, we maintain that there need scarcely be a stronger argument with the House in favour of repeal than the fact that the West Kent planters are opposed to it. Let Mr. Frewen explain clearly to the House " the reason why" the Kent planters oppose the abolition of the hop duty, and we are bold to thin It Wmill supply one of the very best "reasons why" the prayer of the Sussex planters should be granted. We look to the principle-the broad fact of the injurious and severe pressure of that which Mr. Frewen himuself calls that "'unjust impost"-we look, we repeeat to the intrinsic merits of the particular case, and although it would, of course, be highly daeirable to have the support of the members for West Kent, we byno means consider their opposibion of very grave Importance. The da has gone by when petty personal or prvate intersts can oe allowed to stand in the way of tip,ht principles and sound policy. The reasons ulrged by the advocabes for retainnmg the gty are just those which are the last to ind favour or the present tim Of day, The argument of the opponents of repeal are fonnded-expressly founded-on the michievfous nd exploded principles of "class protection," and on nothing else. When even the member for East Sussex gives ulp that principle and adivocates freedom for the hop planterst we cannot think that the repealers have much to fear from the opposition of thoss who resort to the sword and buckler discarded by Mr. Frewen.-Sus8ex4dier1fsnr.

Tuesday Evening.
The railway-market was inl some degree influenced to-day by the preparations for the settlement. Quotations, however, were fairly gupported, and in one or two instances there was a slight advance. After hours less firmness was exhibited. French and Indian presented little alteration, the transaCtions generally having been unimportant. Joint-stock bank shares were steady, with trifling fl'ictuation. British mining securities exhibited a partial improvement, and several transactions occurred in the leading descriptions. Miscellaneous shares were heavy, in consequence of the augmented demand for money. Ottoman Bank left off 11 to 1 discount; Bank of t, f. to i discount; National Discount Company, to i pm.; the New, f to i pm.; London Discount Company, i to i discount; Lombardo-Venetian, 6 to j Tm.; Pernambuco, par to pm.; Riga Railway, I to 1 pim.; Ceylon, 1 to tpmn.; Bengal, i to g pm.; Euphrates Yalley, par to i pm.; Oude, par to * pm.; Central Oude, parto *pm.; Punjab, * to ppm.; European aud Indian Junction Telegraph, i to i pm.; andlNassau, i to 3 pm .

MANCHESTER, JTA. 27.
For long cloths, T cloths, andI the better class of printing
cloths thero is a good demand, atfairprices, tho firmertone of the cotton market having imparted some additional strength in these goods - but xn shirtings and other cloth-, suited to the markets of India and China, the market is nlot only depressed, but great irregularity prevails as to prices. Yarns are much the same as last 'week, with a moderate business of a miscellaneous character, adapted to most markets, but without any transactions of moment for any quarter. Tho finer qualities are in better demand than others, and, being rather scarce, are firmer in price,
Mesrs. John Slagg and Co. report :-"As regards India. and China goods the market continue3 in thesainedull and inactive condition, and the tendency of prices is slightly in favour of buyers. In nearly every other department of the market we have to report a moderate demand, and in consequence of the slight advance in the Liverpool market a somewhat firmer feeling on the part of producers; buxt we cannot quote any actual improvoment in prices."
Messrs. G. Fraser, Son, and Co. report :-" There has been a very quiet market. Present prices evidently prevent transactions of any extent being enterea into. Oar quotations are withoutchange, butthere is some giving way in prices when transactions take place."
The judgment in the case of Mr. Lowe, of Lowe and Lowe, yarn agents, by the Commissioner in Bankruptcy, has called forth some expressions of sympathy by its severity, on the part of these acquainted with this gentleman's amiable quslities and repute for high cbaracterand integrity, the sentence being a suspension for twro years of his certificate, which is to be of the third class without protection, The object has been no doubt to strike a blow at the system, too prevalent, of dealing in accommodation bills, by which the commnercial world has auffered so touch. Mr. Lowe commenced with a capital of 10,8001. iu. 1854, owing to him by a person named Walsh, who was at the time insolvent, but which he considered as guaranteed by Wright, a millowner, who succeeded Walsh in business. The balance-sheet showed debts due to creditors, 25,8381. Us. Sd.; trade liabilities, 727171. - and for bills and guarantees to Wright, 42,5481. 13s. 4d. ; total, 140,604& 4s. Against this, in respect of property, there were debts amounting to 35,4921. 10s., leaving a defciency of 105,112M 143. The bankrupt had kept good ahd correct books of aU his trade transactions, but had kept out of thenm these guarantees of 42,0001. for Wright, and had given three of these guarantees for 6.000L cash at a time when he knew that both himself and Wright were insolvent, The commissioner looked upon these transactions as having brought Mr. Lowe within the penal clauses of the BankTuptcy Act, the 9th clause of the 256th section, for concealing the true state of his affairs,
NOTTINGHA., JAN. 27.
There Is not mnuch improvement in the demand for laco for the home markets; manufacturers are, however, sttll sanguine as to future prospects, and we may shortly expect a better demand. There is not much doing just uow for export.
There isan excelle'it feeling in the hosiery trade. Manfacturers are getting a better price for their goods, and the demand continues brisk. laterialis enormously high, but with a good demand, manufacturers wil be enabled to secure a proportionate advance upon their goods. The operatives in this branch are well employed at tolerable wages.
LEICESTER,, X 27.
Business is quiet, and the hosiery trade, although by no means aotive, is ins, healthy state, We expect shorty to have a revival, wnstil which tue manufaeturers are dttin
obl their stocks, and the present high rate of matevalprevents their increasing them. Wools are exceedingly high. I T ve tEEDS, JA. 27.
The woollen cloth-markets have been active this morning and more sales would have been effected if there had beena
better supply in the market. The chief business, however, s done rtrectly between the manufaoturers and the merchants, without the goods being exposed for salein thehalls Pnces are very firm, with an upward tendencys
The woollen-market at Euddersfield has been steady today, but scarcely so brisk as last week, Stocks are generally lowv, and the price of the raw material induces caution. Speculations in a great measure are confined to new s;tyles. Aissortment orders are frequent. The wool-market}Isbecoming very bare. Port Phillip wvool is in especial demand and very scarce.

London, Wednesday, January 28, 1857.
LONDON, WEDNESDAY, JAIUARY 28, 1857.
'The planters of Tennessee are about to try a great experiment in social legislation. A Committee of Safety at Clarksville has devised a coercive system of a stringency such as even our own Parliaments of former days would have hesitated to apply to Popish recusants or the Irish population in general. WmLIAN: the CONQUEROR himself would hardly have ventured upon such measures with the Saxon serfs. It is proposed to suppress all assemblages of the negroes under any pretence whatever, at frolics, balls, benevolent societies, and even at public worship, where the preachers are black men. The white preachers themselves, those in the confidence of the masters, are desired not to have any communication withl the negroes otherwise than at the regular public services attended by the whites. Slaves are not to be allowed to hire carriages on any occasion, as the practice of driving about destroys the proper sense of their subordinate positioln. Merchants and shopkeepers are desired to have no dealings with the negroes, except with the permission of their masters. There are to be no such things as Christmas holydays, wvhich are found to impair the health of the negro and to corrupt his morals. Negro husbands are no longer to visit their absent wives without a pass from their masters. Many other measures of police are recommended, all tending to shut up every negro on the site of his work, debar him from society, or from the access of new ideas.
This unfortunate race has, indeed, to thank its would-be benefactors for forty summary executions, floggings without number, no doubt many private atrocities, and a systematic tightening of the rein, lash of the thong, and dig of the spurs. No doubt, the nobiest and the best advised schemes of einancipation have often had no other effect than to harden the heart of the tyrant, and add to the horrors of even an Egyptian bondage. No doubt, the Northern Abolitionists are ready to cite a long list of deliverers equally unsuccessful in the first ilstance. On the other hand, it must be remembered that the slaveowners of Tennessee are acting in defence of their property, their position, and their lives. Their terror may be unreasonable, their precautions may be exaggerated; they may be over-sensitive to that sword over their heads, that mine under their feet, that close, smothering, atmosphere of suspicion which the monarch or the master of slaves has ever been supposed to endure. BJut, after all, we who dwell in absolute security, and who do not sleep one wink the less for hearing that thirty thousand builders are out of work in this metropolis, and are daily meeting to see what can be done, are scarcely competent to criticize the defensive measures of men nightly in fiar of their lives. Self-preservation, if not the first instinct of nature, stands very high. Few would hesitate to destroy the highwayman or the burglar, even where property alone was in question. Indeed, in the matter of self-defence we make property part of self, and are all of the opinion of old SnYLoco, that life would not be worth living for
without that proportion of wealth to which we have been accustomed. The slaveowners of Tennessee are not to be regarded as in anywise the founders of this miserable " institution." They, of course, buy and sell slaves, but it is only in maintainirng the existing practice. They came into the world dlaveowners. Slaves are necessary to the cultivation of tlheir lands, the use of their mills and houses, the habitation of the country, the payment of their debts, their own very existence. It is that " state of life " in which they were born." They are defending an order of things inherited from their ancestors, and a necessary part of the whole system about them; and they defend it to the best of their ability and discretion.
But neither the State of Tennessee, nor all the Slave States of America, are alone in the world, or in a position to have a public opinion and a common sense of their own, distinct from the rest of the world, and opposed to the judgment of mankind. In this respect they are in the same case as all other countries; and it is true of aU countries under the sun that they cannot defy the common sense of the world and insulate themselves from the general air of humanity without settling into some vicious singularity. The interference of the Northern States may be insolent, rude, and impertinent; it may go too far in any way; but it is no more to be set at nought altogether thau the puablic opinion of Europe in the coliduct of particular States. Nor does the State of Tennessee enjoy any exemption from those laws of spontaneous development which obtain over aU the races of man, only adapting themselves to his varying circumstances. Nothing whatever can prevent these negroes from a sort of improvement by contact with the whites. They are an imitative race, and they wil do what the whites do, or at least wish to do it. They have imbibed the " white" notion of respectability, and " drive about in buggies." They have dances, frolics, benevolent societies, just like our own labourers. They like public worship where one of their own colour and their own dialect officiates, just as our own labourers are so apt to frequent the Wesleyan, or the Independent, or the Baptist, or the Ranting Chapel, where they hear a gospel adapted to their own senses and faculties, instead of attending the service of the respectable Oxford or Cambridge divine. They also attend public meetings; and here, it appears, the masters have made a great blunder. They have actually invited their own slaves to come to public meetings held for the purpose of exposing, condemning, and denouncing the arguments of the Abolitionists and Freesoilers. The negroes have gathered hence that great attempts were in progress in the north for their emancipation; that the Abolitionists were sending emissaries and even settlers south ; that their own masters were in a great panic; and that, in the opinion of the rest of the world, the institution of slavery was contrary to tile laws of GOD, and certain soon to end. It is true aU this was refuted at these meetings
but, as happens with discourses upon heresy, infidelity, and licentious indulgences, the bane proved stronger than the antidote, and the speaker has more power to disseminate the disease than to cure it. It requires no great shrewdness to discover this mistake; but if the wise pebple of Tennessee will think twice they may make some further discoveries. They may find out that the best devised plans may fail; that they have to deal with a class that listens to speeches, thinks for itself, separates the wheat from the chaff, and is ready to act on its own convictions. It is a serious affair to attempt extreme measures of brute force with a population on whom argument has been tried in vain,-that, in fact, can argue too well for its teachers.
The Slave States may resent the interference of the Old World, but they cannot despise the lessons of its experience. Here, for many centuries, we have been engaged in a continual struggle of classes. Conquerors, races, orders, and interests have had to wage war with the commonalty, and in the end the people have universally prevailed. A thousand badges of slavery have been trampled in the dust, and many a ruin is now all that remains of the baronial family that for ages oppressed the still flourishing town. Hence on this side the Atlantic amoral certainty is felt that no bondage wiU stand the test of time, and that, one day or another, it will certainly give way. There is also an universal opinion, equally authenticated by examples, that the revenge of the oppressed race has always been in proportion to its own abasement. Make your slaves brutes. Allow their reason no exercise, lest they should exercise it ill. Deprive them even of those amusements which we find it necessary to allow to our lunatics. Make them gloomy, reserved, and sullen. Do not let them co-operate even for the offices of common benevolence. Take away their religion. Shut the light of Heaven out of their souls, or-what is the same thing-compel them only to hear the gracious revelations of a higher law and a better state from cold, dull, and hated lips,-from the aiders and abettors in the work of their oppression. Such has ever been the rude policy of the worse class of masters. But it is an effort against the whole stream of change and the irresistible tendency of events. It has only aggravated the final catastrophe. That is the lesson wwhich the Old World can give the New on the subject of the latter's worst peril. It advises the gradual improvement of the servile race, and in that way its gradual emancipation. It warns the few to reflect that they may some day find the many their masters; and for their owrn sake suggests that, while they can, they had better humanize and attach the powerful many. Panic may be an apology, but it has ever been held a bad adviser. It looks only to the present hour. Our survey of social change on this side of the Atlantic goes further back, and as far again into the future. We cannot think that slavery is destined to endure for many generations, for there is no institution of the sort here which has not passed away, or is not now in its last hour. But a consummation that must arrive one day or another should be prepared for; and we can imagine nothing more terrible than the abolition of slavery without preparation.

It is only a few months ago that we congratu-
It is only a few months ago that we congratulated the country on the apparent extinction of its pauperism. Employment was rife, wages high, and content general. Emigration was at a standstill ; the recruiting-sergeant had lost his charm; and occasional murmurs weere muttered that masters could not find workmen, nor the QuEEN soldiers. A short time has clouded the scene with discontent. Several thousand unemployed workmen in London alone clamour for work, and in some of the provincial counties employment is probably at almost as low an ebb.
This phenomenon is not without its explanation. Several crafts-that of building, for instancehave been overdone of late. Squares, crescents, and terraces remain unfinished, either because the builders have no money to go on with, or because they have fouud a better investment for it. Nor are the sufferers themselves free from blame. While the trade was brisk and wages high they combined to make them higher. 'When ihey could get 5s. the unions would not rest contunted x-ith lees than 5s. 6d. Of course, this dLimnished the profit of the masters, and contributed, with other. isaS, to arrest the mania for building. The men hau
much sun in their hayniaking measoa tV ± -
winter of their discontent ;bas comie sooner anuc
lasted longer than seemed likely, and now they rra alternately holding meetings in Smithfield, besieging the magistrates for advice, and knocking at the poorhouses for bread.
It would be no consolation were we to tell these men that their position, though pitiable, is neither unjust nor unnatural; that employment of all kinds has its periods of elation and depression; that men cannot be always building or rebuilding houses to the same extent, any more than they can be always making boots, or ploughing, or sowing; that what the masons and carpenters are suffering has been suffered by ploughraen, spipners, and weavers; and that men who earn good wages for a time ought to put by a portion for a rainy day. It is hard preaching to hungry stomachs, but at least the law of the land stands between the honest man and starvation. More than this it can hardly do. It cannot provide that work shall always abound and wages always be at a maxititmm; that people shal always be occupied in seeking or constructing fresh houses, or that speculation shall always be at blood heat. The bounty of the poorhouse, however, is intended not as a final, but only as a temporary resource. In the present case, the districts in which the unemployed men live are among the poor, though not the very poorest, districts of London. The indigent are, in fact, helping the destitute. Such a process could not last many montbs, and in the ordinary course of events there is no necessity for its prolongation. The trade that languishes also revives; the wages that faU also rise again; and returning spring repairs the ruin of the winter.
To many this is a sorry consolation. But there is, or there easily might be, another. If the era of revival be uncertain and the recurrence of distress almost certain, if employment has its cold and hot fits, and if when it is at zero it is tantamiount to destitution, a remedy exists in England such as could be found in no other country. Although we cannot re-parcel out the domains of our landed proprietors among the feudatories of Smithfield and ClerkenweD, we can still open a way by which these may become greater landowners than they have ever yet dreamt of becoming. England Proper is a little country, and could not well bear the process of re-distribution. But England beyond the seas has ample verge and room enough for the most landed-minded of the unemployed. Take this little world of Great Britain and Ireland, and we grant there are moments when we could wish to add to its length and its breadth. But, practically, this addition has already been made by discovery or by conquest. Australia and Canada are, for all purposes of wages and citizenship, just as much part of England as Warwickshire and Yorkshire are. They are further off, it is true; but, when once reached, they offer a better present, and a far better prospective, field for labour and its earnings than home does. There will be no glut of building for some time to come in either of those grand outlying provinces; or, if a glut does come in one calling, there is always another ready to receive its redundant members. lhere are always waste lands in abundance-not, indeed, to be given away, but to be sold for sums which are within the scope of an industrious man's savings. And none of those who are now gathering in Smithfield or appealing to the Clerkenvell magistrate could wel fail to save in a country where unskiUled labour gains such high wages as it does now in Canada or Victoria. The difficulty is how to get there. The Emi,gration Commissioners profess to help only those who will help themselves. This is an excellent i-ule in ordinary times, especially excellent so far as concerns the colonies, for it sends to them the most thrifty, frugal, and laborious of the working classes-just the men whom, if we had any choice in the matter, we should like to keep at home. But in times of even exceptional pressure it militates against an emigration which would have the twofold effect of lightening the poor-rates in England and creating customers for us in the colonies. It is precisely in times like these that colonies can best receive and utilize the elements of population, and, thereby, of prosperity.
We have spoken of the demand that is made for men in the colonies ; but an equal if not greater demand is made for women. Of course pre.erence is given to women who have not only the disposition to industry, but the capacity for it. Good cooks, good housemaids, good maidsof-all-work are as much valued as good masons, bricklayers, and carpenters. It is astonishing, or rather humiliating, to contemplate how few of our female emigrants have possessed any useful faculty or acquirement. It is said that in one batch of 300 women not one could be found able to boil a potato, and of all household economy they were profoundly ignorant. In a higher, or, at any rate, more pretentious class, it is curious to note how few are familiar -with household duties. It were well if our unions would turn their attention to the duty of teaching pauper children usefull and common things. As they are too frequently brought up they are useless at home and almost useless abroad. But abroad their uselessness is tolerated by their employers out of sheer necessity. In a colony where there is no choice bad's the best. Men put up -with housekeepers who have no idea of accounts, of cooks who can neither roast, nor boil. nor fry; of laundresses who cannot wash, simply because there are none betier qualified to compete with the incapable. At home such people go without places, because the trouble of keeping and teaching them is far beyond the value of the return given. Abroad, in the bush, or the forest, or the jungle, a rude approximation to the skill or experience of more civilized life has its value. Colonists wiU give it every possible trial rather than dispense with it entirely. There are in England thousands of young men and young women whose talent and labour are of the poorest kind. They have been uncared for and untrained, and have become listless and inert. For these England offers no future, no career. It is a chance if they do not live to swell our criminal records; they are sure to swell the union rates. Valueless at home, they have a value abroad. For them the
colonies are a refuge from crime and from pauperism. Though not exactly the materials that the colonists would select in return for their own mouey, they are better than nothing; and the colonists would gladly take them if sent out gratis. It is a question of principle and expedient whether the Commissioners might not deviate from an established rule so far as to make a present to the colonies of a species of labour which has no estimation here but would acquire some value there; and which, if left here, will, in seasons of distress, degenerate into permanent pauperism or harden into callous crime.

In the comprehensive analysis of metropolitan
In the comprehensive analysis of metropolitan mortality just issued by the REGISTRAR-GENERAL, tbouigh we may fail to detect many features of novelty, we can at any rate discern obvious warrant for satisfaction and encouragement. Whether from the favourable character of the successive seasons, or the improvement of our sanitary regulatirns, or the general welldoing of the population, or these end other causes combined, it is certain that ft-. retrospect fortheyear1856presents resultsun-
Iuillygratifying. Taking the one great fact inwhich
m minor statistics are represented-the excess of births over deaths-it is found that the balance is
more in our favour for the pMt year than has been the case in any year withli the limits of comparison. The numbers added to the population ia this way are upwards of 30,000, while the rate of nlortality itself was singularly low. Within the boundaries of what is termed London the ordinary residents are no fewer than 2,610,248, and to every 1,000 of this total the usual computation allows 25 deaths in the space of 12 months. Last year, however, the rate was but 22 per thousand-a proportion more favourable than is shown by any year except 1850, in which, as it is reasonably supposed, the field of destruction had been somewhat narrowed by the extraordinary ravages of the cholera in the previous autumn. The gross number of deaths in the 52 weeks ending the 27th of last December was 56,786; that of births, 86,833. In the distribution of the sexes the usual features are perceptible. More males are born than females, but, as the employments of the stronger sex disperse them over all parts of the world, more females are found in the actual population than males.
These periodical statistics of mortality invest the various maladies to which life is exposed with characteristics and attributes almost amounting to individual impersonation. We can take this or that disease, and measure not only its destructiveness but its favourite times of visitation; we can identify its haunts and classify its victims. Of our principal enemies it is satisfactory to find that some are getting perceptibly weaker than of late. It is, perhaps, hardly to the purpose to speak of smallpox, for PROVIDENCE has placed in our hands an instrument by which this scourge of the human race can be arrested-arrested, it may be said, almost at our own discretion; and when, therefore, the REGISTRAP.-GENER&L speaks of the decline of this disease he is probably only chronicling the results of a more careful resort to vaccination. We learn, however, that scarlatina also is decreasing, and that it has been growing less and less destructive since the year 1S51 ; that the hoopingcough has also ceased in some measure from its ravages; and that measles alone, out of the four epidemical disorders thus classed together, has exhibited any tendency to increase.
From the observationsrecorded of the temperature, and of the connexion traceable between the vicissitudes of the weather and the operations of disease, we may draw two or three deductions of considerable interest, especially as they rather militate against some of our preconceived opinions. Nothing is more common than to hear the sharp colds of a British winter spoken of as decidedly conducive to animal vigour ;-a "fine frosty " morning" seems quite a natural expression, and we doubt whetner congelation could ever be carried to such an extent as not to be called " very seasonable" weather. Even ancient proverbs tell the same story, for it is said that " a green " yule makes a fat kirkyard," and certainly rain and fog are cheerless enough to malke us wish for the bright bracing clearness of a good frost. But the inexorable logic of the RGisTRAui-GCNERAS calculations tells entirely the other way; and it seems that the health of the year depends materially-at any rate in the metropolitan districts-upon the mildness of the winter. In 1856 the months of January, February, and March were favourably characterized in this respect, and the mortality was low accordingly-in fact, notwithstanding our persuasions about autumnal epidemics, the warrm months are almost invariably the healthiest of the year. On the present occasion we have been indulged with a stil more minute investigation upon this point, and the results are certainly impressive. The reader will, no doubt, recollect some remarkable changes of temperature which occurred about two months ago. November appeared to be closing mildly, when all of a sudden severe frost set in, and continued for a few days, when it as rapidly vanished. The period of cold reached from the 26th of November to the 5th of December, both days inclusive; and the REmISTRAR-GENERAL has compared the mortality of the metropolis during these ten cold days with that prevailing during ten warm days, two of which preceded and eight followed the cold period. The very first approach of frost sent up the number of deaths, while its departure instantly sent them down again-the figures in the aggregate being 1.844 for the cold period, and 1,505 for that of comparative warmth-giving an average in favour of mild weather of nearly 34 lives a-day.
In the distribution of deaths over the various districts of the metropolis we learn the usual connexion of mortality with the observance of sanitary laws. " Westminster," we are told, " selected for measures of improvement with some "cother districts, exhibits a decided decrease in the " deaths," and indeed the causes and effects here indicated are now so notorious in their relationship that they need scarcely be insisted on. In the rate, too, of mortality assignable to the several occupations of mankind in this mighty city we may observe many points of interest as well as utility, and one, indeed, is represented in features so decided as to be really amusing. It has always been usual to regard anniitants as endowed with peculiar tenacity of life, and in the occasional bitterness of irony they have been deEcribed as the real "undying ones" of the human race. We confess, however, that we never accepted the impression so completely in the light of a fact as it is placed in by the tables before us. At the census of 1851 there were living in London 3,072 persons classed as "independent gent'emen," and 4,719 defined as " annuitants." Now, whereas in the last twelve mon'hs there died of the former class 546 individuals, of the latter and larger class there died only 34 ! The reader is not to understand that the number of inlependent gentlemen in London is actually limited to the figures given above, the class in question being devoted only to those not returned under any cflice or occupation.
So vividly is the course of things now depicted in these statistics of mortality that the great work of nature in substituting one generation for another can hardly be said to proceed imperceptibly. We can trace the operations of death under almost every form, and observe the warnings and remedies which PROVIDExcE has placed at our
command. To those, perhaps, who reflect that, after all, the years of man are still, as in the days of the Psalmist, but three score and ten, it may seem that the pretensions of sanitary science to prolong life rest on a very slender foundation. But the truth is that our efforts are required not to surpass this standard, but to attain it. It is only by vigilance and energy in the work of selfpreservation that the appointed average can be reached; and it is when we read in such calculations as we have now been considering the number of years and lives which are lopped off by preventible disorder that we feel in its fullest force the duty imposed upon us of employing to the utmost the remedial means within our reach.

The Monitekr publishes the following letter from Nioe, dated the 23d inst.:_
"Hijs Majesty King Victor Emmanuel arrived yesterday at Villafranca, at 9 a.m., on board the steam-frigate Gover. nolo, esorted by the Mozambano.
"Ater the customary salutes from the forts, from the Russian frigate Olaff and three Sardinian brigs in the roadstead, His Majesty landed on the quay, where he w&s received by Count Cavour and by the civil and military authorities of Villafranca. The King at once mounted his horse, and, accompanied by a brilUiant staff, passed in review the 9th Regiment of the Line, drawn up in line of batle oil the squaro. Hlis MIajesty was loudly cheered byethe troops and by the population.
" At 11 o'clock the Royal corlf4,e arrived at Nice. Onx the Vittorio-square a triumphal arch had been erected, where the civil authorities, the Consular body, and variou1s officers of His Majestys household were waiting to receive him. An amphitheatre had been erected on each side of the road, and contained a number of ladles, who braved the bad weather to see the display. All tha houses in the town were decorated and the windows full of spectators. On His Majesty's arrival he was enthusiastically cheered on all sides. The Syndic addressed a speech to His Majesty, to which he replied in a few gracious words, and the cort6ge then proceeded to the Place des Phoceenus where the National Guard and 10th Regiment of the Line were revieoved.
"H His Majesty then proceeded on horseback to the Vila Avigdor, to pay a visit to Her Majesty the Empress of Russia. At 1 o'clock the King again mounted hiohorse and proceeded to his palace, where he received the local authorities. In the e vening the town was brilliantly illu-inated; the ilumination of the viUa of the Empressof Russia was magnificent. The King, who drove about for a long time in an open caleche, was everywhere received with real enthusiasm."

Death Of Baron Alderson.
DEATR OF BARON ALDERSON.
We regret to announce to our readers the decease of Baron Alderson, which took place at his residence in Park-crecent yesterday afternoon, in his 70th year. The Hon. Sir Edward Hall Alderson, Baron of Her Majest)'s Court of Exchequer, was the eldest son of the lato Mr. tPobert Alderson, barrister-at-law and Recorder of Norwich, by the daughter of Mr. Samuel Harry, of Great Yarmouth, where he was born in the year 1787. Having received his early education at the Charterhouse, then under Dr. Matthew Raine, he proceeded to Caius College, Cambridge, where he closed a briUiant career as an undergraduate by taking his degree in January, 1809, as Senior Wrangler and Smith', prizeman, and Senior Chancellor's Medalist; thus obtaining the all but singular reward of the very highest honours which that University has to bestow for classical and mathe. matical attainments.
In the following year Mr. Alderson was elected a Felow of his College, and in 1812 he proceeded to take his degree as Master of Arts. He had been already called to the bar of the Inner Temple in the pre ceding year, and for several years went the Northern Circuit. He became well known in his profession by editing in conjun ction with Mr. Barnewall fivevolumes of reports of cases heard in the Court oE King's Bench between 1815 and 1820, which form part of the standard classical series of law reports of that court, and which were afterwards continued by Mr. Justica Cresswell. He never hold a seat in Parliament, but perhaps on that very aeco unt had leisure to earn even aV higher reputation as a legal junior, and to secure a very extensive practice as a Chamber counsel. Wbile still wearing a stuff gown, he was promoted, in 1830, to the Court of Common Pleas as an additional puisne judge (Mr. Justice Patteson and the lat Baron Taunton being his companions in the elevation); and on that occasion ho received the honour of knighthood. He was tran sferred from that court, however, in 1834 to a puisne judgeship in the Court of Exchequer, where for many years he was second to the late Mr. Baron Park. They were the two great legal laminaries of that court, and they deUvered judgment in many important cases with great learning. Among other oases of more than ordinary interest Baron Alderson decided the Turf question in which the name of Lord Bglintoun appeared, with reference to tho disputed right of the stewards to c xclude from a racecoursa persons who had paid for their admission ; and his decision was fully approved by the professi on, though it seemed , rather novel application of a strict rale of law which considerably startled the world outside. He also took a very prominent part in leading the discussion and sifting th evidence in the celeb-ated Gorham case when it came before the three superior courts, and in the question as to the liability of Mr. Alderman David SAlomons to legaL penalties for attempting to vote in the House of Common, without having taken the usual oaths " upon the true faith of a Christian."
Baron Alderson bore in his profession the character of a careful, learned, and conscientious judge, though his mind was naturaly inclined to take a rather hard and dry view of the question at issno, and to strip it, almost to a fault, of extraneous matter. His intercourse with the members of the bar was uniformly courteous and friendly, and his good humour and perhaps over frequent jocosen ess made him generally popu. lar. In 1823 be married the youngest daughter of the Rev. Edward Drewe, of Broadhemb ury, in the county of Devon, by whom he had a large family,

Her Serene Highness the Princess Hohenlohe and
Her Serene Highness the Princess Hohenlohe and her daughter arrived at the Lord Warden Hotel, Dover, from Calais, yesterday afternoon at half-past 5 o'clock. They were to sleep at Dover last night, and proceed by the 8 o'clock train this morning to the residence of her Royal Highness the Duchess of Kent.
A Cabinet Council was held yesterday afternoon at the official residence of the First Lord of the Treasury, in Downing-street. The Ministers present were Viscount Palmerston, the Lord Chancllor, Earl Granville, the Marquis of Lansdowne, the Earl of Harrowby, Sir George Grey, the Earl of Clarendon, Mr. Secretary Labouchere, Lord Panmure, the Chanicellor of the Exchequer, Sir Charles Wood, the Right Hon. R. Vernon Smith, Lord Stanley of Alderley, the Right Hon. M. T. Baines, and the Duke of Argyll.
Tins EARL OP RAItEWOOD.-ThO following report of the medical gentlemen attending the Earl of Hlarewood was issued yesterday morning:-
" The Earl of H.rewood bas passed a quiet night. with somertra'quii sleep. His Lordsbip continues conscious and free fromn feer.
" Harewood-hose, Tuesday morning, Jan. 27.
The following accoutnt of the accident which befell the nol-le earl supplies a few additional particulars to those which have already been published, and corrects one or tvwo trivial errors :-The Bramnam-moor (formerly the Harewood) foxhounds met on Saturday morning last at Stociceld-park, near Spofforth, the seat of Mr. J. B. Faviell, and sn the course run his Lordship took an ordinary hedge or fence, but discovered, when too late, that there was a sheep-net on the opposite side, in the meshes of which the hind feet of his hunter got entangled. The horse, a fine spirited animal, plunged violently, and in the struggle fell, roliing over his Lordssip and inflicting severe injuries. Some persons near who saw the accident hastened to the spot, aud rendered what assistance thoy could in releasing the noble lord. He was teken up quite insensible, and continued so for some time. He was carried to a neighbouring cottage, and quickly attended by Mr. Moore, of Spofforth, and Mr. Ledgard, of Wetherby. The family surgeon, Mr. J. G. Smith, of Harewood, happened to be in the neighbourhood, and on hearing of the accident hastened to the spot. On examination, two incised wounds, disclosing a compound fracture of the skull, were discovered, and there were also evidences of severe internal injuries in the chest. It was thought best to remove his Lordship home as soon as possible, and he was accordingly conveyed to Harewood.house, in Mr. Faviell's carriage. Mr. Teale. of Leeds, was subsequently sent for, and it was then determined to telegraph to London for Sir B. Brodie; but he was confined to his house by indisposition; and Mr. C. Hawkins, the eminent metropolitan surgeon, was despatebed in his stead. Mr. Hawkins arrived at Harewood-house at noon on Sunday, and soon afterwards the operation of trepannimg was perforned by Mfr. Teale, aided by Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Smith. The absent members of the family weresummoned early, special messengers being despatched to communicate to them intelligence of the lamentable accident. The event bas thrown a deep gloom over the village and neighbourhood of Hare. wood, where it is hardly necessary to state his Lordship is justly and deservedly beloved. Lord and Lady Wharnciffe, Mr. Charles and Lady Louisa Mills, the Hon. Edwin LasceDlles, MsLP., the Hon. and Rev. Janfes Lascelles. and the Hon. George and Lady Louisa Lasceles, were at Harewood-house at the timo of the accident. The Hon. Arthur LasceDes arrived at Harewood-house late on Sunday evening, from Norley, Northwich. A telegraphic despatch has been forwarded to Rome to the Hon. Egvemont Lasceles who is on his wedding tour.
DUBLIx CLUB POLTrTCS.-To the horror and dig. gust of a Dublin Derbyito journal, the Unives Clubthe very embodiment of Toryism-bave " of tSeir owit motion elected Mfr. Justice Keogh a member." Assuming this astounding intelligence to be true, the indignant organ awaits some explanation, but in the meantime suggests that Mr. Keogh, if really elected, should at once retire, and thereby " save the painful necessity of liftimg the veil which might have been allowed, outof respecttohisoffce, tocover his antecedents." Failing to obey this advice, the learned judge is warned that, " should be be so ill-idvised as to force himself upon the club, after the notioe which we have given him, he must be prepared to abide by the consequences of his own act; ang we think we shall be able to satisfy at least the Conservative gentry and clergy who are members of it that it is quite impossible that Ir. Kooghaxnd they can meet in theasme club; and we beg to suggest to them the propriety of an immediate general meeting to consider the conduct of the committee, and th adopt fqrther mea£uu,te,"

At the close of the past year some of the most influential members of the commercial community of Liverpool, consisting of men of all parties, including the gentleman who is now Mayor, MIr. William Brown, the M.P. for the soDthern division of the `oounty, the cnairman of the Dock Committee, the presidents of the Chamber of Commerce and of the Principal associations of the town, and three-fourths -of themagistracy, feelingthatsome expression of their -approvalof the ablereport made by Sir John M'Neill 4andColonelTufloch upon the grossmismanagementof the Crinmean expedition was due to them, drew up an address, obtained numnerous signatures to it, and one of the borough members, Mr. J. 0. Ewart, presented it to the worthy commissioners, accompanied by the followfing note:-
"I iterpool, Jan. 19.
Dear Sirs,-As one of the members for this borough, I Uve been requeated to transmnit to you the accompanying address.
"No intimation has been given of it in the local newspapers, nor has it been left in the usual places for signa. ture.
"It is simply a spontaneous tribute of the subscribers, and the names attached to it embrace those of the leading men of every party and of the commercial community, in-cluding the gentleman who is niow Mayor, my hon. col.
league Mr. Horsfall. the member for the southern division of the county, Mr. Brown, the ohairmiian of the Dock Committee, the psesidents of the Chamber of Commerce and of the principal associations of the town, together with threefourths of the magistracy, Sir T. Birch, &c,
" TYA~ddress expresses the deep sense we entertain of the sen ees rendered to the country by the fearless report you have made of the gross mismanagement in the Crimea; and that while honours have been bestowed upon some of those to whom the sad calan,ities whioh occurred were mainly owing, the honest exertionis you made to retrieve in some degree those disasters have so far been treated with .cold neglect.
"We trust, however, that the strong public feeling entertained, not only by this great town, but by the whole country, will find its appropriate expression in the early action of Her Majesty's Government.
" But, whatever may be their decision, the services which you have rendered will long live in the memory and be cherished in the affections of a grateful nation.
" It is a peculiar gratification to me to be the medium of transmitting this address to you, and
1I have the hononr to be, dear Sirs,
Your faithful servant,
" J. C. EWA&RT. "Sir John M'Neill, G C. B, Colonel Tulloch, &-c." The address was as follows:-
"To SIR JOREi M'NEILIL. G.C.B., &c., AND COLONEL
TLULLOCH.
"We desire to express, however inadequately, the deep sense we entertain of the debt of gratitude which is due to you for the services you have rondered to your country,services attended wv4th results, the value of which it is impossible to overrate, and requiring an exercise of courage =n determination which it is difhicilt adequately to estimate. "Looking back to and comparing the condition of the army previnous to the commencement of your labours with the state in which you left it, it is not too much to say that to your exertions we owe the preservation of the remnant of that noble body of men, and the rescue of the country from -impending failure and disgrace.
" We feel keenly that if services such as these are to be passed over with silence and ingratitude, vhile reward and promotion await those whose neglect, apathy, and incompetence caused the evils, the, consequences of which you in p art averted, it must tend to discourage men of patriotism, -nonesty, and talent from entering the public service, cripple the powers and enervate the exertions of those who may have already entered it, and do irreparable injury for the future.
" We feel, therefore, that it is the bounden duty of the -overnment to mark its sense of the services you have rendered, and that i' is incumnbent on every portion of your countrymen to lose no opportunity of offering you the tribute of their gratitude.
It is difficult to say whether pride or shame claims the largest share in the history of the late campaign.
" An army whose active daring, and still more heroic endurance, exceed all that is recorded in ancient or modern history, bas seen its ranks fall th-ck and fast under cold, hunger, and disease, until h some regiments hardly a man remnained, the mortality from these causes alone being four-
old that 'which has made Walcheren a 'word of fezr and shame for half a century, while clothing in abundance lay unused in the stores of Balaklava, and cattle lined the shores of the Black Sea within 24 hours' sail.
"We feel tbat it is hardly necescary to assure you that the proceedings 'which since the presentation to Parliament of your searchng, honest, and able report have taken place, apparently with no other object but to screen from demerved reprobation those who are justly responsible for the mismanagement which has been followed by these terrible consequences, have been attended with no other result than a confirmation of the truth of that report.
" The opinion of a tribunal which proclaimed its own incompetence to deal with the subject submitted to it (an. incompetence made more manifest by each succeeding line of its proceedings), which, as was but too evident from the first, had arrived at a foregone conclusion, and before which evidence too honest to be acceptable might peril future promotions, deserves neither attention nor respect.
" The proud consciousness of the h;gh duty you have performed, and the good you have done, is the highest reward you can receive; next to this is the deep and lasting gratitude of your countryman.
" It is our share of this feeling which we now beg respect-fully to express.
" Liverpool, Dec. 27, 18:6."
Immediately upon its receipt Sir John M'Neill returned the following reply :
" Granton-house, Edinburgh, July 22.
iGentlemen,-You have done me the honour to transmit to me an address in which more thpn 100 of the leading -gentlemen of Liverpool, holding various political opinions,
have united in coaveying to me and to my able and upright coUleague, Colonel TuUoch, your thanks for our services while employed as commissioners in the Crimea.
"The approbation of men who so fully and worthily represent that enlightened intelligece and that knowledge of the world and its affairs which have extended British commerce to every country of the globe, and have raised a kingdom comparatively smaU to unequalled grealness, is an honour of which any public servant must be proud; and I beg of you, gentlemen, to believe that I have received with gratitude, and that I will preserve wvith care, this unexpected record of your apDrobation. Perhaps I may be permitted to add that its value is enhanced by its being the only public docnment I possess wh ch contains an acknowledgm-nent that any service whatever was rendered by the commission.
" Believing that the Government 'which employed that commission has failed duly to acknowledge its services, and -that public interests are endangered by the course which has been pursued in regard to it, you have p'otested against that course, and have expressed your own views of the Lenefits which the country has derived from our exertions. It was natural that under the influence of those generous sentiments you should attribute to us merios far higher than 'we could venture to clains; for it is the natural impulse of generous nimds to magnify the obligations which they desire to acknowledge. The consciousness, however, of having been instrumental in promoting the improvement which was effected in the condition of thatiioblearmy to which the country cannot be too grateful, and of having aiso done something towards preventing the recurrence of those evils which it -endured with unexampled fortitude, undoubtedly does afford ie an amount of permanent and tranquil satisfaction fargreater than I could have derived from any other reward. But while I have never, during a public service of more than 40 years, solicited of any Minister any favour or reward for myself, I stM considered it my duty, immediately after our report had been presented to Pariiament, to bring officially to the notice of the Secretary of State for V7 ar the zealous and efficient co-operation for which I was indebted to my junior colleacue Colonel Tullocb, and to solicit a reward for him. When I consented to proceed to the Crimea at the head of a commission I conceived that my duty to the country was in perfect accordance with the intentions and wishes of the Governmert. Lord Paltnerston had urged the substitution of a commission in the Crimea for the committee of the House f Commons demanded by Mr. Roebuck, and had thus, as it appeared to me, pledged the Government to an unflinching inquiry. Mfy duty, as I understood it, was to conduct that inquiry without fear or favour, and to report the result faitbfully, without considering whom it might inculpate or whom exculpate. Rht welfare of the British army, the honour of Her Majesty's arms, the interests of the nation, in more than one quarter of the globe, and the success o/ the war waged to defend tbe freedom of Europe, were all at stake in the Crimea, and I did not consider it possible that at such a moment any one could give way to mere personal considera-tions.
" Colonel Tulloch, 'who had sub-equently been appointed to accompany me, and who had already rendered valuable services to the army and the countTry, cordially concurred in those views of our duty, and I took early and frequent occasions to aunounce them on ourarrivl i th emma.--
"Having carried out those views with undeviating and -often painful fidelity, and having, in measured and moderate terms, temperately stated the results in our reports, -accompanied by the evidence, oral and documentary, on whicll tbey were founded, I conceived that we had done -our duty both to the GJovernment and to the country. It -then became thea iu'siness of the Government to protect the public interests mivolved in the assertion and maintenance of every truth contained in our report that could be made available for the advantage of the army or the nation, and I declined to interfere with the execution of the trust which bad devolved upon Her Majesty's Miniisters and for which they alone were responsible.
,. Wt objects, with reference to us aild to our report, may hdf been contemplated by Her Majesty's Ministers in -the course which they thought it proper to pursue I do not pretend to know or to understand - but 'whatever their intentions may have been their proceeAings appear to have -roduced a very general impression that the acknowvledged adelity of our report was not in accordance with their wishes; and the feeling thus prGd-qced must affect the disposition of the country to intrust to the executive any inquiries connected with the army that may hereafter be ,2aUed for. This is a result which, with reference to constitutional consideration, they, as Ministers of the Crown, cannot be supposed to desire.
"W hile the proceedings of the Government, acting through the War Department, were regarded as indications -of a desire to discredit the commissioners and neutralize their report, the language of the Psiine Minister in the HXouse of Commons evinced his disposition to do them jutice. In the debate on the 29th of February upon Mr.
Roel uck's motion condemnitgthe course which the Govern. nient w ere pursuing in this mattier, and after Mr. Peel, the olghli of the War Departmnent, had excited much irritation by a speech hostile to the commissioners, Lord Palmerston,' in answer to a challenge,or appeal from Mr. Gladstone, expre;sed in strong terms the entire satisfaction of the Goverm nee,t with the conduct of the commissioners, and freely acRknowledged.the advantages which the public service had derived froin our proceedings. The subsequent conduct of the C'overunmtnt seems to have indicated less of accordance 'wit h the eelitiments thus expressed by its head than with those which the public had attributed to the War Departsnient.
| woe r.ceiitlv, at a dinner at Arbroath, on the 30th of Deccii,ber, ILord Panmure stated, forthedfrsttimein public, that ~he U;overnment approved our report, which had then be.t in his hands nearly 12 months, and before Parlia. n ent ant the public almost as long. The tardiness of the enuouluineenwit by that member of the Government at viwe special request the commissioners undertook the service they had performed, whose instructions they had faithfully carried out, to whom they had made their report, -who vas prituarily responsible for all proceedings in regard to thi m, and from whom they were especially entitled to look for coututenance and support, is a matter of which I am altogeth er unable to give any satisfactory explanation.
* li tue meantime the proceedings to which you refer had I*eii carried on at Chelsea bya boerd of general officers. selectedi by the Governient, and acting under its eye and I supervisi,,a. Of the report of that board I need only say
that I c.,nsider it a suitable result of the proceedings which I led to it, and which are not calculated, I fear, to impress
the peo.ple of this country with profound admiration of the taste, the feeling, or the spirit in which they were carried on.
"Tbe candour and fairness with which the commissioners desired to acquit themselves of a painful duty is clearly evinced, I think, in their report, and especially in the concluding paragraph (p. 49). To conceal the defects which had been iiiade apparent would have been to betray the trusi reposed in us. To seek occasions to cast obloquv on ii.dividuals would have been altogether repugnait to our feelings. I do not beleve there is a single passage in our reports that can justly be regarded as implying or iiun uating the slightest shadow of an imputation on the motives of any man.
" The officers who complained of that report have mostly been less scrupulous; but the whole matter is now before the publ!c-the tribunal of ultimate resortin all such cases -and 1 leave it with entire confidence in their hands.
" The Lost anxious wish of the country, from the Queen to the humblest of ber subjects, was to provide the army of the East with al that was necessary to its welfare, and even to its consfort. There was no time, from the commencemtent to the termination of the war, at which the people of this country were not ready to furnish any amount of funds that might be considered necessary for that purpose. The resources of the country were greater than at any former time; its poawer to produce every manufactured article that the army could require was such as the world had never before seen; its mercantile marine provided fleets of transports, includiDg its niagnificent ocean steamships, such as no other army ever commanded; the resources of the Turkish provinces were found sufficient to supply nearly tbree tinses the number of men with abundance of wholesome food for another year without being exbausted; the army occupied the same ground throughont the whole time, and was as stationary as the population of a town. No part of it was ever more than seven miles distant from a secure harbour, and a considerable part was encamped within a mile or two ofW the port. The allied navies had undisputed command of the sea, so that vessels of all classes navigated it with the same security as in a time of profound peace. Yet the country is expected to believe that, with all these almost boundless resources and these mneans and facilities, it was impossible, by any exercise of talents, energy, and foresight, to provide either sufficient food or sufficient clothing for 20,000 or 30,000 men during their first winter in the Crimea.
"This is a proposition upon which you, gentlemen, are perhaps better qualified than any other body of men to pro. nounce an opinion, and you have now repelled the impeachment of your inteUigence and knowledge implied in so extravagant a demand on your credulity.
I It remains for me only to repeat the assurance of the gratitude and respect with which
I have the honour to be, gentlemen,
Your very obedient humble servant,
"JJOHN 3ENEILL.

Colonel Tulloch's reply was as follows:-
63, Eaton-square, London, Jan. 24.
Gentlemen,-I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of the address kindly forwarded to me throupgh Mr. Ewart, M.P., expressing your thanks for the services of Sir John M'Neill and myself, as commissioners in tho Crimea.
"If anything could add to the satisfaction with which I have received this spontaneous mark of approbation from one of the first cities in the empire it would be the time chosen for presenting it.
"During a warfare such as that through which this country has recntly passed expressions of opinion are apt to be tinctured by the excitement of the moment, but when that is over the deliberately recorded approbation of a body whoso position, habits, and intelliaence render them so well qualified to juoge becomes doubly valuable.
4 I aln apprehensive that the warmth of your feelings in this matter may have led you to plAce a greater value on my services than they merit; but, whatever may be their value, I can at least affirm that they have been truly and conscientiously rendered, to tCe best of my ability, with ut respect to the psrties who might be inculp%led. The period which has elapsed since the publication of the proceedings of the Chelsea Board seems rather to have strengthened than iPnpaired the conviction that the facts recorded by myself and colne ue in our report were hut too well founded.
llaving stated in a volume just issuing from the press, and of which I transmit a copy, my objections to that board, even though professional reasons induced me to appear before it, it is unnecessary for me to make any further comments on that head; but, in conclasion, perailt me to assure you that I shall never forget either the kind feelings which have induced the present address, or that my cause was upheld by the public as their own when I lay on a sick bed, unconscious ox what was passing and unable to defend myself.

THE MAIL STEAMER VIVID.-A letter from Ostend,
THE MAIL STEAMER VIVID.-A letter fromOstend, dated Saturday, in yesterday's Indi'pendance Beige, says:
"This morning, at about 4 o'clock, the Royal Belgian steamer Rab;s, Captain Dafour, on the way from Dover to Ostend, perceived a versel m.kin;g signals of distress off Dunkirk. On getting near the commander found it was the English mail steamer Vivid, which left Ostend yesterday evening for Dover, and which had broken the axle of its wheels. This accident had caused such a complete derange. ment in the machinery that the Vivid could get no further. Commander Dufour hastened to lend assistance, and after many efforts succeeded in tsking the steamer in tow and bringing it on to Calais, where they safely arrived at 8 a.m. Some minutes afterwards the Rubis left Calais, and arrived here at 11 o'clock."
STRAXNCE CASE OF PoisoNnio.-A farmer who keeps a dairy near Glasgow lately lost eight cows in the following inanuer:-Having bought a large wooden tub from a dealer in second-hand articles of that kind it was filled with water, and when delivered at the fam-m house appeared perfeotly clean. Boiled food for the cows was, accordingly, put into it, and then distributed among eight of the cows; three of the eight very soon showea symptoms of sickness and distress, owing, as was supposed to their having been the last supplied with the food which had been next to the bottom and sides of the tub ; and, after suffering groat agony, roaring and writhing sn a manner mostdistresing to witness, they died in the course of the next day, and the day following a farrier was got to open and examline the dead cows, and he found manifest symptoms of poison having been the cause of death. The other five were affected lees virulently, but were evidently becomiaqg worse from day to day in spite of every remedy which was prescribed, and were therefore killed to save them from more pretracted suffering. The farmer thus lost eight cows, which, he says, averaged a value of 141. apiece, 1121. in alL One of the staves of the tub, having been sent to a chymist, was found to be impregnated with sugar of lead nearly throughout its whole thickness, so that, he remarked, it contained as much as would have killed 40 cows. The ,vendor of second-band tubs said he had bouglht the one that had proved so fatal at a chymical works. The farmer hesitates, we understand, to raise a claim for damages against one or both of the tub vendors, because of its being a new case. If he is so advised, we cannot help saying we hold such an opinion to be a most irrational legal refinement. Surely, the first man who got a limb broken by a railway carriage was not denied compensation; nor should we fear to raise an action of damages if our head were to be broken by a cocoa nut, though it mionit be the first instance in Britain of such a misisle being uted for such a purpose: to common sense it appears that the effect, and not the cause or means, is the question the law has to consider in a civil action-has injury been done, and what is its amount ?-Glasgowt Mail.
NATIONAL AssocIATiox OF FACTORY OCuortS.- The second annual meeting of this association was held yesterday afternoon at the Manchester Towr-hall, Mr. E. Ashworth presiding. Mr. Whitworth, the secretary, read the annual rc port, which referred chiefly to the passing of the bill introduced by the association in the last session of Parliament, to effect a reasonable modification of the imperative provisions of the 21st clause of the Factory Act, 7th and 8th of Victoria, cap. 15, wbich required all mill-eearing to be " seoarely fenced. ' The committee state that they are not aware of any case of arbitration having arisen since the statute was passed, but they feel confident that its provisions wil be found an ample protection to the operatives and willprove sa',istactory to the employers. Notwithstanding the heavy expenditure of prosecuting the bill, a balance of 2, 6751. remains available fortho purposes of theassociation. Mr. Lewis, of Derby, moved the adoption of the report. He congratulated the association on the success of their proceedings, and considered it was the first time the factorY interest had received anything like justice at the hands of the Legislature. He was glad that there was no proposition to dissolve the association, which it was most desirable to retain in operation, not for pnrPOSeS of a*ression, but as a means of protection to tho trade. Mr Clapham, of Airedale, seconded the motion, which was carried unanimously. Mr. Wright, of Oldham, moved a Tote of thanks to the executive committee, which was seconded by Mr. H. Mason, of Ashton, who recommended extreme caution on the part of the members individualy in not laying themselves open to attacks such as had been made upon the trade, as they would always be losers if they had to fiht public opinion. The motion was carried unanimously. ir. T. Cooke, of Mancbester, remarked that the factory occupiers could not better secare public support than b atrictly obeying the law as it now stood. Mr. N. Buckley, Mayor of Ashton; Mr. Rowland, of Oldham; Mr. -J. Simpson, of fanchester, and other gentlemen took part in the remainder of the proceedings, whEich wFere merely of a furm al charac'tert

Yesterday, at 1 o'clock, a deputation from a society established in the city for promoting the interests of the trading community, headed by their chairman, Mr. Stratton, had an interview with the Chancellor of the Exchequer at his official residence in Downing-street on the subject of the income-tax. Among the gentlemen composing the deputation were-Mr. Wilcher, Dr. Chalice, Mr. Cornwall, M1r. Mitchell, Mr. Lawrence, Mr. Doutswill, 31r. Gannon, Mr. Nott, Mr. Stocker, Mr. Shalton, Mr. Underwood, and Mr. Hayman, the secretary of the society. They had, in preEenting themselves before the Chancellor of the Ex chequer, a different object in view from that sought by the previous deputation, who had an interview with the right hon. gentleman on Friday last. The society of which they are members is iLt present directing its efforts to the entire removal of the income-tax on all incomes, from whatever source derived, not exceeding 1501. a-year, and also to the exemption of the first 1501. on higher assessments. The object of the deputation on Friday, it will be remembered, was to procure the remission of " the war 9d." from and after the 5th of April next, and a more equitable adjustment of the remaining part of the tax affecting incomes derived from trades and professions.
Mr. STP.ATTON, addressing the Chancellor, said, the society represented by the deputation was composed for the most part of tradesmen who, feeling more or less severely the pressure of the income tax as at present imposed, had invited general co-operation for the purpose of procuring some readjustment of it. With this view they had procured a large number of signatures in the metropolis and from all parts of the country to petitions to the Legislature on the subject,-tbeir object being to influence the Government to relieve a large class of industrious persons in the community altogether from the operation of the tax. He referred to the smaller class of shopkeepers, who had to struggle against great competition for a livelihood, and who, being already subject to heavy local taxation, felt the pressure of the income-tax most oppressive. The object of the deputation was to suggest, as an act of forbearance towards this struggling class, the entire removal of the tax on incomes which did not exceed 1501., and the exemption of the first 1501. of higher incomes, so that if a man was in the receipt of 5001. a-year he should only be chargeable on 3501.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUE. asked Mr. Stratton to have the kindness to state exactly what class it was they represented?
Mr. STBATTo?N replied, small shopkeepers mostly, a most industrious class of persons; clerks, the higher order of working men, and, indeed, all persons of moderate income now chargeable to the tax. His business as a manufacturer brought him very largely into contact with the retail grocers, a very large and laborious class, who paid large sums to the revenue in the lump on the articles in which they dealt, which they received back in instalments from their customers, and who had to pay income-tax, notwiths ending the bard s$roggle they had to w age for a livelih ood. He submitted that they especially had a claim for relef from the impos, as being themselves large collectorsof revenue, in cases where their income did not exceed 1501.
Dr. CssALIyE reminded the Chancellor that when persons with incomes of 1501. a-year were brought within the range of the tax, it was thought, from the extreme cheapness of provisions, they would not seriously feel its operation. But now one cause of its growing unpopularity was that many were called on to pay a sum of money in the lump, in the shape of income-tax, who were really astraitened ix procuring the common necessaries of life. He himself knew many persons who two or three years ago contributed to the income-tax, but who had fallen into poverty, while some had been driven to seek parochial relief. Those were people who had, among others, been taught to look forward to the benefits they would derive from direct taxation. The deputation claimed, therefore, that in any re-adjustment of the tax, towards which they thought the right hon. gentleman seemed disposed from the answer he gave to a similar deputation on Friday-
The CGn"CELLOR of the EXCHEQUER (interrnpting.)-I said nothing on that occasion about my making any re-adjustnient; I said I was quite ready to entertain any detailed proposition of that kind that might be made to me.
Dr. CHALICE said, at all events he thought he saw a glimmer of hope of a re-adjustment in what the right hon. gentleman said at that previous interview. The tax was acting most injuriously on the community at large for the interests of the country, and there was a general feeling of dissatisfaction growing up against it. He would not have come there to-day except for a recent public meeting in Southwark, in which he took part, and at which resolutions in accordance with his own views on the subject had been unanimously passed. As regarded the pressure of the tax on persons with an income of 1501., when they looked at the Iigh price of provisions, clothing, and house rent, and at the increase of the poor-rates, the impost bad begun to touch a class on whom the Legislature never intended it should operate, because it was supposed that those in the receipt of 1501. a-year would be above the reach of privation. He knew persons of that class had been obliged in consequence of being called to pay income-tax to take their children from school. Then, again, clothing was very high in price.
The CHIASCELLoP-Is that so?
Dr. C}IALICE said, it was. Calico and many other materials of clothing had greatly increased in price since the area of the tax had been extended.
The CH,ANCELLOR.-YoUspeak of the sense of injustice pressing on the minds of the poorer class of persons on whom this tax fals. Will you explain that injustice? Is it in the assessment being unfair ? Is it in the unpleasant rate of the income-tax ? Or is it in the fact of persons of small incomes being subject to the tax at all ?
Dr. CTALICE said, he had not the slightest doubt that the war 9d. had made many people cry out against what they had previously borne patiently though they even from the first conceived it to be a hardship; and the mode of assessment was also felt to be objectionable. There was a large number of bachelors, many of them lving principallv at clubs, with incomes bringing them within the range of th
tax, but who nevertheless managed to evade paymentof it; while there was a numerous class of persons, mostly with families dependent on them-mon employed in factories, dockyards, Government and merchanW offices, and the like-in the receipt of salaries rendering them just liable to the tax, but who had not such facilitiesfor escaping i's payment even if they were disposed to do so. When he used the word "injustice bethought he was justified in doing so, because men of that cass felt it to be such in having to py so large a sum out of their own earnings at a time waen they were deprived of some of the necessaries of life.
The CHANCELLOR.-I am afraid a bachelor tax might operate as a constant incentive to imprudent marriages. (A laugh.) I think your explanation leads to the inference that it is principaDy in the large rate of the income-tax that its present injustice is found to arise.
Dr. CHALICE had no doubt that that stimulated the existing feeling with which it was regarded; but he thought,with the present prices of provisions and clothing, it was hard that people with only 1501. a-year should be caled to pay the tax.
The CHA.NCELLOR.-Can you show that the Legislature takes any means ot fixing prices artificially beyond the necessities of taxation?
Dr. CIIALICE was not prepared to say that. He could only say that when incomes of 1501. were brought within the tax that was a time when tt e receipt of such a sum implied the enjoyment of some few luxuries; but it was not so now,
The CHANCELLOR.-Whatevermay bethepresent amount of prices it is not in anyway owing to legislation. With regard to the assessment on persons of less affluence-say some classes of shopkeepers-are there not many cases in which no regular account of receipts and disbursements is kept?
Dr. CHALICE believed that was so, especialy with small shopkeepers in L-ondon.
he CH,,dNcELLon.-Well, in that case how is the assessment made? Is it not made generally on a principle of indulgence ?
Dr. CHtLICE said, he believed it was so in London, but in the country it was quite the reverse. He knew many persons who paid income-tax and who had been summoned at the same time for the non-payment of poor-rates, Many extreme cases of hardship connected with the collection of the income-tax had been brought under the notice of the society he now represented. Without presuming to ask the right hon. gentleman to state what the views of the Government might be on the questions which had that day been brought under his attention, not he was sure for the first time, he (Dr. Chalice) would only now venture to hope that the right hen, gentleman might be induced to apply his mind to their re-conisideration.
Mr. GAINNoN said he had carried on business as a shopkeeper for 31 years in the neighbourhood of Clare-market, and it was with pain that he had seen how rarely indeed any of his poor brother tradesmen engaged in vending the necessaries of life during that period bad been able to retire, after years of industry, with anything like a provision for old age.
The CHANCELLOR asked if Mr. Gannon attributed that to the operation of the Income-tax ?
Mr. GA.NNso said he did not, but to the oppressive and unequal operation of the local taxes, among other causes, and also of indirect taxation. He was a retail grocer, and he could state from his experience, to prove the shifts to which many of the industrious poor in his neighbourhood were dnven, that he had often to serve
d of them, who-ca to buy smaUl quantities of ea etr isofd ah pon wof thate atoce hehdalt
t,*beforehnesold aponoftaaril.Teohdllo contribute their share of the indirect taxation. He could conscientiously say that the indirect taxation paid by the middle and labouring classes on the every-day necessaries of life averaged from 35 to 40 per cent., and on some articles it was as much as 100 ner cent. He was certain, if it were the rule, instoad of the present mode of indirect taxation, to send collectors round and make monthly or quarterly demands for a specified sum of money for tea tax, aud so on, the people would never for a moment tolerate such imposts. In his own case, as a smaU tradesman of 31 years' standing-and the same might be said of thousands of others-if he took the average of assessments to the local taxes made upon him durimg that period at 161. a-year, it had amounted to 4961.; if indirect taxation paid upon the indispensable necessaries of life be added 201. a-year, that would make 6201., makiDng a total of 1,1161. Could it be wondered at that with the competition of the day, and such sums abstracted from men hlke himself, that our workhouses, prisons, and lunatic asylums had so many inmates who were respctable, industrious tradespersons at one period ? The collecting Income-tax from men situate like himself, and the extent to which the industrious poor were subject to indirect taxation of the common necessaries of life, were producing a serious amount of dissatisfaction on the minds of the people, which he was convinced would sooner-or laterbe exhibited in some strilcing manner.
The CHANOELLOR of the ExCHEQuxR-With regard to the question of the pressure of the poor-rates in parishes where there is a large poor population, that is a necessary consequeuce of the present parochial slstem, It is true
that in St. George's, whichis a rich parisb, *he poor-rates *re contiderably lower than in St. Clemsnt Danes, in whoich Mr. Gannon lives; but many people tink t is essential tothe present system of poor laws that the lation should continue parochiaL Propoals have been made -particularly with regard to towns-to extend the area of taxation. but a1 sch proposals have met with great oppo-
parish holds to its own separateness and to its exclusive rigat to manage its own affairs; and every other plan has encountered many diflicalties. As to taxation on tea and sugar, as well as income taxation, the taxation of the country must either be direct or indirect. You must either go on income or you must go on articles of general consumption,-such as tea, sugar, beer, spiri.s, snd the like,-or you must resort to both those means of taxcation, as now arranged; but at present it does not faU on the p,rncipal articles of consum hon There is nO tax on bread orbiscuit- on meat, dry or salt; fish, dry or salt; native fruit, or vegeta les. These are staple articles of food; and if a man could confine his means of subsistence to them he need not necessarily pay any taxes. But if Mr. Gannon's views were adopted I fear the unavoidable consequence would be, not that the Income-tax would be lightened, but that it would be necessarily aggravated.
Mr. WILCHER and anotber member of the deputation also briefly addressed the Chancellor.
Mr. HAN-bLkN caUed bis attention to a case of great cruelty in connexion with the Income-tax towards one Edward Walker, of 1, Mary-street, Bromley, who accompanied the deputation. Mr. Walker stated that he had a wife and four young children (the eldest 12 years of age) ; that he kept a smal chandler's shop, his returns not exceeding 31. 10s. per week, the profits upon which were never more than 10.; that the value of his stock was under 20s.; and that he had no other means whatsver for the support of his family, save by casual employment in the docks. On a recent occasion he waited for2lconsecutive days, from 7 o'clock in the morning till near mid-day, without getting one hour's work, and on the 22d day was employed five hours, at 4d. per hour. Ile solemnly declared that the entire profits of his s:ophad notbeen more than 261., nor his other earnings morethan aboutlol., maldng in the gross asum notexceeding from 361. to 401. per annum during the whole of the last and present year, and yet he had been charged Income-tax on 100. per annum. He had made these cironumstances fully and repeatedly known, both to the local comnissioners and the Board of Inland Revenue, and he had, nevertheless, been adjudged unworthy of rebief, and ordered to pay the amount-41. 15s. 10d. Mr. Walker added he was in hourly expectation of having his goods seized and his family turned into the streets, being entirely destitute of the means of paying any portion of the tax.
The CsANcxLLor. said he knew nothing of the case of Mr. Walker beyond what had been related to him; but he would cause inquiry to be made into it. That was all he could do at present.
The deputation then retired.

The Law Of Divorce.
THE LAW OF DrVORcE.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I trust you will allow me to state that I have had no participation whatever in'the authorship of "A Review of the Dirorce Bill of 1856," just published, and noticed in 17ie Times of to-day. I never saw the book till it was completed for publication, nor, when I read a previouS work on the same subject by the same gentleman, was I acquainted with the author. I am certainly glad his pamphlet should be published, and I think it more likely to do good than my own, because he has the advantage of professional legal k-nowledge, and because his arguments proceed from a noble, generous mind, untainted by the stimulus of personal resentment or suffering.
For the main'question, argued by both,-the establishment of a Court of Divorce, or tribunal to decide the disputes of married persons--suffcr me to say one word. It is precisely because I think such a court would diminish, instead of increase, the number of separations and divorces that I desire to see it established. Sir Walter Rlaleigh, in his obsolete but excellent remarks on the improvement of the English navy, quaintly observes,-" It is said, I Blessed are the peace makers ;' and so say I; and therefore blessed are they which build our ships of war, for these help us to maintain peace." I consider a marriage tribunal would " help to maintain peace" by controlling the disputant who now fight their own battles, and by bringing those battles to a speedy, certain, and summary conclusion. I do not pretend that a woman can argue on a great legal reform otherwise than defectively; but I do insist that, whether strong or weak, passionate or calm, all my arguments have had but one aim and tendency,-namely, the establishment of a tribunal in which man themselves would judge how far a wife deserved punishment or support. Men are to be the judges; that is surely a great security against the false wlarms of multitudinous divorces on the petition of wives. I neyer argued for facility of divorce. I believe, even if it existed, it would be the last remedy women in general would seek. I might refer your readers to page 48 of the Beviiew of the Divorce Bill of 1856 for discussion of this point. Thousands of women (and I am one among those thousands), would rather endure any degree of poverty and lonelness than see a stepmother set over their children, if there were no other reason against divorce. But between "facility" of divorce and "possibility" of divorce there is Ia great gulf set." On what grounds such pos-
ibility should be based I do not pretend to argue. I only urge that a tribunal should be able to interfere between tusbands and wives as between fathers and wards in Chancery-that it should be possible to grant as much protection to women as to pecuniary interests. All war between man and wife must of necessity be an unnatural war, and therefore all measures which may tend to abridge or prevent such war and substitute the overruling of justice for personal struggle ought to be encounraged, instead of inspiring dread and a prejudiced resistance. I regret that such a court should even bear the title of a " court of divorce." I see no reason why, in that, as in other courts of justice, reconciliation and compromise should not often be advised and effected. I believe the knowledge of its existencewould be the cause of much private compromise, as the fact of its existence would prevent much oppression. I believe if such a court had existed when the original action was brought by Mr. Norton, the subsequent storms, struggles, pamphlets, and public scandals, would have been avoided. I believe such a court would have awarded me an allowance and the care of my three children, all of them under the age of nurture, aged respectively six, four, and two years. I believe that had such a court then existed, and such a decision then been made, Mr. Norton and I, so far from being divorced, would have been reconciled, as was his own wish andproposaL. There wasno obstacle in his mind. The obstacle was in the interference of others and his attempt to combine the overruling of others vith his own inclinations. I quote, not my own vehement pamphlets, but miy husband's words,-his written words to me,-that such a re sult would "bring peace and possibly sunshine upon the remainder of our lives." Nor did I then meet my husband as "the tyrant man," nor with vindictive and bitter reproaches, nor even with the wounded pride that wanted a girl's wooing to be persuaded home again. As he asked so I answered, and to his "Will you return ?" I gave my sorrowful unhesitating "Yes." I have nowhere argued against a wife's forgiveness of wrongs. In that mystery of union there should scarcely be anything it is "impossible" to forgive. But I say that in both positions, whether forgiveness be possible or whether it be impossible, a legal tribunal should have power to decide between the parties. Even if the decision were adverse, it is but a " snitor's cause" lost; it is not fraught with the unimaginable bitterness of finding the adverse judge in the vowed protector. Then, instead of the state of things at present subsisting (under which neither bond, agreement separation divorce, allowance, nor any of the anomalies arisingout of the division of interestainmatrimonihlquarrels can be absolutely settled or controlled by any human being), those who came toriskin theirhour of wrathallthepeace and hope of their future might be met by the calm cold decision of the law; in some, in " unusual cases," to mete out, it may be, only severe justice; but in others, in the more
u saal," common, and frequent cases, to bring "peace and poasibly sunshine" on the remainder of lives that might else have been wasted in vain battling and ever-recurring scandaL I desire to argue not for the "rights of women," but for their one right, the right, founded on nature, equity, and religion-to the protection of man-and, failng her natural protector,thatthe lawshould have powertoprotecther,which it is admitted by all that the law has not power at present to do. I hope to see such reform as shall give this power to some distinct legal tribunal in the coming sesson, and that many a young angry couple, who stood on the brink of the precipice that led to utter disunion, may find from it the benefit, not of divorce, but of a rescued future, so that " peace and possibly sunshine" may settle on their lives long after the stormy light of ours shall have gone down into the darkness of the .-ave

Interest And Discount.
NTEBRE)T AND DI,SCOUNT.
TO TE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-A few weeks ago you were so obliging as to give insertion to two letters, the purport of which was to ais. connect in the public mind the discount and short loansmarket from that other market in which loan transactions are so conducted as to settle the rate of interest either per. nmanently or for several consecutive years.
It is not intended to attach much importance to names in this distinction, except thatv when the transactions referred to are specifically those of discount (as in our monetary discussions they usually are) there is no reason for employing the general and indiscriminte term of " interest."
It is, however, of importance to separate the ideas; and 'n submitting our classification for that purpose it is to be ebserved that in the lists of borrowings we include aU Government stocks, which, although they are regarded, and rightly enough, as property or even capital to the stockholder, are only so in virtue of their being charged against, and in equal degree diminishing, the entire capital of the country. In other respects they are simply loans at interest
and take their (place in the following categories on that footing:-
1. Loans on security of land, buildings, and machinery, mortgaged.
Loans for long periods on personal security.
Debentures of British or foreign railways, canals, docks, and other enterprises.
British or foreign Government stocks. Exchequer-biUs and India-bonds.
2. BiUs of exchange or notes of credit, discounted.
Loaus, at caU or at short periods, on the security of biUs of exchange, notes of credit, or warrants for merchandise.
Loans, from account to account, on the security of British or foreign Government stocks ard bonds, or of the stares and debentures of railways, and other enterprises.
There is surely no difficulty in admitting a distinction between these two classes, and, although the lowest particular of the one is not far removed from tbe highest of the other, yet they are, in the main, almost as different in their re. spective quantities, the persons engaged, the purposes, and all the proximately affecting causes as any two markets can be. The ultimate cause-that of supply and demandaffects, of course, these markets as it affects all others.
At periods like the present it is often a subject of surprise that it should be possible for the banker to obtain six or seven per cent. in return for his capital, loaned out on biUs or other short appointments, while the fundholder or the mortgagee must be satisfied to obtain three or four per.cent. All are lenders alike, and lend the same thing, which is capital; but the reason is that they lend in a different market, and under different circumstances.
Let us ilUstrate what we mean by a familiar example. There arc two classes of persons who let out horses on hire; the. one class includes those who let them by the day, and ihe other class includes those who let them by the year. When an occasion of sudden demand arises, such as a race or a review, the first class is enabled and fairly entitled to claim a double price; but the second class-the jobmasterscannot double their price, because they let in a different market, and under different circumstances, Both markets in the end, it is true, must submit to a rato of hire which is regulated by the cost of horses and of horse-keep. As it is with horses so it is with capital: the horses may be of one kind, yet affected from accidental ownership and situation by two modes of letting and hiring; and so may capital be of one kind, yet affected by two modes of lending and borrowing. Discount-capital changes daily in amount; interest-capital remains about the same for considerable periods.
Another popular remark of the present period is of the soundness of our trade with foreign countries; that our merchants are not trading beyond their means, and that our warehouses are not glutted with foreign merchandise. All this is very consolatory as far as it goes; but so long as we are unable to retain our fair share of imported gold and of our own accruing capital we cannot help suspecting that it is removed by some under-current-sonie cause that makes no appearance in our trade returns.
The balance of trade is quite a different thing from what it used to be, and anyattempt to arrive at it by a comparison of quantities and prices of imported and exported merchandise is almost labour in vain. The chief article of import now is foreign indebtedness, which sets all returns at defiance.
The supply of Indian and Canadian railway shares was described in our previous letter. Take for another example the process by which the acres of the United States, when scarcely recovered from the waste, are symbolized and in a wonderful manner coined into money in London. Some of the railway stock of America pays its interest in London, and is as transferable in London as if the railway were situated in Kent or Sussex. Whatever may have been the distrust of American securities in bygone years, we must not be blnd to the fact that they are becoming more and more popular on the London Exchange; that they are brought here for sale in enormous quantity and when purchased mnust be equally paid for as if they were bales of cotton or other merchandise; and a Sardinian or a Turkish bond, even if made and issued in London, is, so far as concerns the balance of trade, of like effect with an imported chest of indigo or bale of silk.
The too eager confidence with which persons subscribel beyond their means to ob,ects of uncertain result, looking for their profit not to the revenue of the enterprise, but to the mesale of their shares, is one of the bad characteristics of the times; they overbuy themselves to begin with, and, not having the means of meeting the appointed calls, are induced to pledge what they have already paid for, and to continue their speculation on terms which make it certain ruin to themselves. As yet we are only witnessing the early part of the drama which is pretty regularly reproduced. It was played out in 1825, and again in 3846. The stage and the actors are now different, but the last act will be about the same.
All lenders or borrowers at interest are lenders or borrowers of capital, and not of money, and this distinction cannot be too much insisted upon; indeed, the money or coin of acountry, being its circulating medium, is deficient of some of the important essentials of capital; it yields no interest, and it cannot go to pay foreign debts; it resembles that reserve of the banker, or that store of the shopkeeper, short of which he could not conduct his business-a kind of dead stock which is totaly inconvertible until the occasion arises for winding up. This occadon, although it might ococr to the banker or tradesman, could not in the nature of things occur to a people; and if it could its approach would probably be marked by a decrease of credit and a simultaneous increase of metalic circulation.
The expression so familiar to us all, " interest of money,' entirely misconceives the source from which interest arises. Hardly a week passes without offering to our observation some evidence that this money or circulating medium of whatever kind, which is the mere vehicle of capital, is too apt to be regarded not only as if it was itself capital, but as if it was endowed with powers equal to all that sum of capital of whose changes and circumstances it is the gauge. Lot us take as an instance of this the following paragraph from a recent letter of one of your correspondents, condemning the last act of Parliament for regulating the issue of banknotes:-"'Is the act of 1844 to be repealed or not? Will you have a currency contingent on the mere amount of bullion in one departmnent of the Bank, and a rate of interest rising or falling as that variable barometer indicates? Will you have a rate of interest which between 1&18 and 1855 was changed 26 times, &c. ? Will you have, as in 1847, a pressure amounting almost to ruin. with the Bank reserve below a mill'on, with the anomaly of the rate of exchange rising, and six millions of gotd uselessly lying within 20 yards of an exhausted Exchequer? -Wil you have an approach to a panic annually? Or will you put an end to this mischievous act, and allow the Bank of England or the issuers of banknotes to be guided by a commonsense view of all the circumstances of a commercial crisis, and to act without the convulsive jerks of an il-constructed and iUl-regulated machinery, ruinous to the merchant, but affording large profits to the banker?"
Whatever the defects of the act of 1844, it is not likely that the common-sense views of the issuers of banknotes could be saverted to and relied upon in its place. The years 1797, 1825, and 1839 may be instanced as the trials of that kind of common sense, and very fallible it proved.
So far from the act in question having caused the pressure in 1847, the history of that period rather points the other way; for, the restrictions of the act being stiUl in force, the rate of discount was, according to the term of bills, 5i, 6, aud 6l per cent. This scale was apparently less thAn the circumstances warranted, because on the 23d of October, when the restrictions of the act were suspended, the rate of discount was raised to 8 per cent., and then everything began to fall into its right place. On the 22d of November the 3ate was reduced to 7 per cent., on the 2d of December to 6 per cent., on the 23d of December to 5 per cent., and on the 27th of January to 4 per cent.
It would seem, then, that the act of 1844, although a collateral circumstance, was not the cause of the disorder; nor is it here asserted that too low a rate of discount was the cause; but that a high rate of discount was the remedy will at this time hardly be denied.
How would the author of the foregoing letter have proceeded to bring about the restoration of affairs ? Woula he have issued a second set of notes upon some or all of the six millions of gold, making it as if to carry double ? His advocating a low rate of discount implies that he would and so have further diluted the circulating medium, whicl. relatively with the circulating medium of other countries was already weak and over fulL It is iothing to my that the vAqbap5p were rising, oo long as they were too low for
tl e purpose of retaining our capifal; isd the e$dieti o adding paper to the circulation would undoubte* haw kept them so. And let as hero, as before, ask the qrJftior if, as the objectors say, the high rate of discount now'1tevailing in London is caused by this act of Parliament, Mat caumes it in Paris and in Hamburg-in ParLi, where baun notes are issued in the "common-sense' fashion, and in
smhburg; where they are not issued at all, or only against an equal value of silver locked up in the bank vaults?
rhen we find that such exaggerated powes can be ascribed to paper money we are almost disposed to Snterta1n a doubt whether the eeonomy which we ought to derive from it is not more than cancelled by the incurable rsisapprehension attaching to peophed minds as to its attributes.
The main advantage of paper money lies not in the, increased capital which it places, or seems to place, at our command, bat. in the greaer facility with 'which it enables us to effect the payment- and receipt of large' amounts. This facility wo-u]d be none the less if five sovereigns or a thousand sovereigns had been locked up for every equivalent banknote issued. It is tryn that an issue on these terms would be a public loss, or rather a public cost, of some 200,0001. or S00,000. a-year, being about the equivalent of the tax upon dogs or of a single farthing in the pound of Income-tax. Still, considering that it would effectually, silenco all tho clamour that 'we hear about the managementi or mismanagement of the currency, that of itself would be, no slight set-off.
To bring this series of letters to a conclusion let us shortly restate the matter and She motive under which they hiver been conducted.
The ingredients that make up the capital of this country, however substantial in tho aggregate, are some of them verr astificial.

The Falkland Islands.
THE FALKLAND ISLANDS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TI31ES.
Sir,-If you do not consider the subject of the Falkand Islands as already sufficiently discussed, perhaps the following remarks on the two letters I have noticed in this morning's paper may be of some slight service:-
In reference to Mr. Eddy's letter, where he quotes that of Mr. ltennie, I add my humble testimony to the truthfulness of his arguments. I say, and say it most earnestly, froma what I myself have seen and know, that very many shipmasters are perfectly ignorant of the Falkiands, except as a cluster of dreary islands, rather in the way on a homeward-bound voyage; and that, from the circumstances I alluded to in my last communication, those who are aware of their existence as a place of shelter and to refit pass them by, and go to Montevideo or Rio Janeiro. I am quite ready to give proof of this, and mention cases, if called upon.
Mr. Eddy is correct when he imagines that the resources of the Falkland Islands are not already developed to the utmost, and he is true in saying that " the one-half, and that the best half,is wholly unoccupied and untenanted byman orbeast," except where the mission station is located on anL outlying island. I have, Sir, gone entirely round the Falklands, and in and out among the various passages, excelent harbours, and secure anchorages; and Ihavo found,especially to the westward, such an abundance of tussack, better pasturage, seals, excellent fish, and appearance of mineral wealth, thatlam surprised at that part having been so long neglected. In one of the highest mountain valeys I have gathered the wild raspberry. On Saunders Island I have had any number of rabbits, delicious geese, and teal for the mere trouble of shooting as fast as I could, and sometimes with. merely knocking the wild fowl down with a stone or stick. Eggs of the best eating, and very large in size, may be col. lected at the proper season by hundreds, nay thousands The climate, though always boisterous, is most healthy; and I am convinced, were a trial given, under proper management, and avoiding some of the defects of past policy in local rule, that the Falkland Islands, but particularly the West Islands, would speedily become a thriving and self-productive colony.
As a proof of the ignorance of many nautical men concerning the Falklands as a place of shelter and for refitting. I may mention w hat Captain Duval, of IHis Imperial Mhajesty's French sloop of war Beaumanoir, told his ExceL lency Governor Moore and myself. Captain Duval had beenr on a ormise ofsome few weeks in the Patagonian and Falkland Seas. He came into Stanley Halrbour for refreshment, expecting, as he said, " to find only a few hats, and to be able to get some beef from the settlers." To his surprise he found himself in a place where a representative of our gracious Queen was located as governor, and where the hospitalities of Government-houso-always abundantly manifested to every ono by his Excellency Captain Mooremade him, as he told me, almost fancy himself again in Europe. He intended to make a most favourable report to his Government of the advantages of the Falkland Islands, and of the manner in which he had been received.
Again, I was in Montevideo on one occasion, wben the American brig of war Bembridge arrived there from the Straits of Uagellan, bringing to Montevideo the crew of a British wrecked vessel found in those straits. I conversed with the captain of the Bembridgo, and expressed my sur. prise that he did not take the British seamen to the Falk!ands, so much ncarer, and a British colony; but r have no, hesitation in saying that it seemed to me he was perfectly ignorant of the fact that a British colony with a governor existed there. I could mention many more facts to prove that the Falkland Islands have been, in my humble opinion, too long neglected, and are too little known, but I fear to trespass on your space. I hope, however, to do so in another form, for I conscientiously believe it would, as I have already said, be of immense benefit to the whole commercial world if our Government would take the matter up, and make those islands a penal settlement. I must not trouble you, Sir, with ideas or arguments, but simply confine myself to practical remarks. And now for a few facts that I myself know and can vouch for, whatover may have been Mr. Rennie's experience to the contrary.
I have by me a living specimen of the beautiful Falkland Island box-tree. I have varieties of the productions of those islands. I have, at Goverunnent-house, proved what can be done in those apparently barren islands by partaking of currants, peas, excellent potatoes, delicious green vegetables of all kinds, and, with slight exceptions, almost everything as at home. Beef, mutton, pork, wildfowl in abundance; whitebait, smelt, and mullet, besides a variety of other fish. Of mullet, at one haul of the Government net, in a short space of time, 1,500 were caught on an occasion when I I was at Stanley, and they were so plentiful that it was only the apathy which unfortunately rests upon. the colonists, owing to their isolated and all but forgotten existence, that prevents, in ioy opinion, a good trade being made of the fisheries about the Falklands.
With regard to the kelp, I have seen it tried for manure, and know it to be excellent; and I have no doubt, from. what I havo heard Mr. Ilavers, the active and shrewd manager of the Falkland Island Company, say, that there ara abundant means on these islands for the support of any population that mright be placed upon it. Mr. Ptennie may not be familiar with the West Falklands, though I believe he made one brief eruise round them during his governorship; and they are rarely visited except by scalers and Aimerican whalers, who have long since found it worth their while to make New Island, West Falkland, a sort of "place of caL"
Your correspondent " W. D.," whom I believe I know. truthfully gives you all the information that at present may be necessary; but as he, I believe, never visited the West Falklands, it may perhaps happn that in the daily observations I was in the habit of makggthere maybe found afewadditional facts that will prove of service. These I shall be happy to give in a future letter should you desire it, and the subject still attract attention.

To The Editor Of The Times.
TO THE EDITOB OF THE TIAIES,
Sir,-I beg to remind your readers of a fact which may throw light on the capabilitics of tho Falkdand Islands t, support a convict colony.
In Norway, betweon the latitudes of 58 deg. and 64 deg.. are raised rye, oats, six-rowed bere or bigg, and potatoes rn considerable quantities, besides- barley, carraway, hemnp, flax and peas; and this result is obtained in spite of every disadvantage. The soil is shallow, poor, ulicious, destitute of lime and encumbered with stones, except ih * fevw favoured spots. The system of agriculture is very defective. The summer is short, and the corn often damaged by frosts. Yet the Norsk men, amid these unpromising ci.
cumantance, raise extensive tfllge crops, Dot on in theu elleys, but very generally on mo¶ntamn slopes and nidges 800 or 900 feet above the sea levo-nay, I have even seen there ripe fields of corn at elevations from 1,100 to 1,50f
Making full allowance for isothermal peculiarities, and& without stopping to instance the stony wastes of Galway, brought into successful cultivation, orthe.histories of many unpromising uplands in this antd other countries further noith, made productive by voluniary labour, dos it nott seem strange, that while the free and honest 1iorik men can make a living under suchu nfavourable conditions, the Falkiand islands should be tbought incapable of imppiorting a convict colony ?
It would rather appear, from the information just gi*.sv; as if these islands needed nothing but the vigorous X*Ica, tion of convict labour for a few years, in drQ2g, fencing, road-snaking; manuisng, and tilli,g, to xies the land productive.

The Procureur who was appointed to draw up the report on Verger's appeal to the Court of Cassation concludes it, I am assured, for the rejection of the appeal. The affair wiU be brought forward on Thursday, and Verger's counsel will be heard in support of the appeal.
The proposition presented to the Council of State for the grant of a pension of I00,OOOf. to Marshal Pelissier has been negatived by the particular section to which it was referred. The castmg vote was that of the President. The objection, however, is not to the grant itself, bat to the form in which it was made. The provision was that it should revert to the Marshal's descendants in the male line. The section of the Council of State considered that this was an indirect means of establishing a majorat, and they therefore rejected it by, as I have said, a majority of one. Marshal Pelissier is, I believe, a bachelor, but he is not too old to marry. Indeed, there was a report (said, however, to be unfounded) of a marriage with one of the ladies who holds a responsible of4~ce at the Imperial Court. Be this as it may, there is no dissentient voice as to the grant itself, but only to the form. It will be brought in due course before tne Council of State in full assembly, and there is little doubt of its passing.
The Revue de Paris, to which some eminent republican writers, such as MM. Miehelet, Jules Simon, iEHenri M-artin, &c., are contributors, is suspended for a month. It has been prosecuted for having published, in one or two recent numbers, a novel objectionable on the score of morality.
Cardinal Fran9ois Nicolas Madeleine Morlot, just appointed Archbishop of Paris, was born at Langres, in the department of the Haute Mamne, the 28th December, 17905. After having been parish priest of the Cathedral of Dijon, and subsequently vicargeneral of that diocese, he was consecrated Bishoo of Orleans on the 18th August, 1839. Appointel Archbishop of Tours by Royal ordinance the 28th June, 1842, he was created a Cardinal in the Consistory held the 7th March, 1853, and he received the Cardinal's hat from the Pope the 27th June following. There are stiM three sees vacant in France -Aix, Tours, and Limoges.
The Presse announces that the Tribunal of Commerce of Paris gave judgment to-day in the case of the Directors of the Company of the Docks Napoleon against Fox, Henderson, and Co.} declaring thq convention made between the parties on the 14th of February and 24th of July, 1854, void and condemning Fox and Henderson to pay all the expenses.
The Moniteur de l'Arm&e contains some details relative to the new fortifications which the Russians are constructing at Anapa. When peace was concluded they determined to drive the Circassians out of Anapa, which they accomplis'hed after an obstinate resistance. The Circassians have made repeated attempts to regain possession of this important position, but always without success. The Russians are, busily employed in rebuilding the fortifications on an improved plan. A pier is likewise being constriucted to give shelter to the shipping. The vil_ages of Tarrak and Kepoli, situate in the middle of a fertile plain at a verst and a half from Anapa, are to be fortified and receive [a strong garrison. Notwithstanding the difficulty of executing the works they are progressing rapidly on every point. The foundations of the ancient fortifications constructed by the Turks in the year 1784 are excellent, and were not completely destroyed when the Russians evacuated the town in June, 1855. The barracks are already rebuilt, as well as the hospitals and militar? storehouses, and two churches have been repaired. An aqu.educt, which did not previously exist has been constructed, and the old Spraugs whcic were filled up when the Russians evacuated the'town, have been reopened. These works are being executed exclusively by the troops, of whom two brigades are employed at them. They formed part of the army which defended Sebastopol. These troops have frequent engagements with the Circassiais, and the latter not long since intercepted and captured a convoy of provisions, which has caused the garrison of Anapa much inconvenience.
MM. de Pourtales and de Corrioles, two of the leaders in the insurrection of Neuchl.tel, and who were imprisoned until released on the 17th inst. at the intervention of the British and French Government, have arrived at Marseilles.
Notwithstanding the arrival of 180,000 hectolitres of wheat at Marseilles during the week, prices are firm, in consequence of the continued demand for Spain and for the southern deDartments of France. 16,000 hectolitres of Said Egyptian wheat have been sold for delivery at from 19f. 40c, to 20£ S0c.; 15,000 hectolitres of Marioupol at from 29f. 37c. to 30f. 31c.; and 5,000 American. at from 33f. 12c. to 33f. 43c.
Trade in Paris continues dull, both atnong manufacturers and shopkeepers. Purchases are only made to supply the present wanes of consumers, and, although the stock of goods on hanld among the shopkeepers is small, they aFre slow in renewing it, and it appears that this state of affairs muts continue until the Bank of France shall be in a position to give the trading community that accommodation which a commercial city requires. The export trade is completely paralyzed by the difficulty of negotiating the best paper having more thani 70 days to run. The most solvent foreign houses seldom settle their accounts until six months after the delivery of the merchandise. The French manufacturers find it impossible at present to accept those terms, and when they insist on short settlement they are forced to submit to such a reduction in the form of discount that aU their profits are absorbed. Another impedirment to the transaction of business is the excessive rise in the price of the raw materials employed in manufactures, and the -increase in labourers' wages, consequent on the -high price of provisions and house-rent in Paris. The last letters from the united States give no hopes of a reduction in the price of cotton, and, notwithstanding the great quantity of raw silk imported from the East, prices are so exorbitant that the manufacturers are deterred from purchasing. The -accounts from Rouen and from the manu facturing. towns in Alsace are better. Business appears to be reviving. Orders have been received there from the departments, but none from Paris. The rise in the price of corn in Paris is checked, and no doubt the fal would have been greater were it not for the constant rain, which creates some uneasiness for the growing crops. The markets in the departments are wel
supplied, nnd the farmers (who held over their stock in hopes of obtaining as high prices as last year) are now anxious to sell, fearing a further fall. Flour of the very best quality was offered at the last Paris market at 80f. the sack of 157 kilograrames. Inferior samples fell at least a franc the sack. The millers endeavour to maintain prices; the bakers, however, were able to supply themselves at from 74f. to 77f. the sack. Two circumstances tended to lower prices at the last marketthe appearance of a large quantity of flour from the well-known Darblay mills, and letters from IflMe announcing a fall of 2f. a-sack on wheat. There is a complete absence of speculation on the Pari corn-niarket. The reserve of flour has again decrea~ed, h,d is now below 8,000 quintals.

er was ^ slight decline in the cattle markets of. tb~e 4 t lents last week; but the Paris markets are risng, and there is not any hope of a reduction n tlprice of buteher's meat. It appears from a
calclaYtion made by the order of Government, that the odnsumption of butehers' meat in Paris has increaed by 90 per cent. within a few years, while
the pfoduction has diminishedain consequence of the
dearness of fodder. The hig b price of wine haa nearly xtopped all sales at Beroy, and stil there is no probability of any reduction. The fact !A, the
production in Franoe since disease appeared in the vineyards bas not been equal to the demand, and the deficiency has been supplied by a mixture of foreign wines and by distillation. Spirits of wvno are stationary. Languedoc is quoted at 212f., and beetroot at 140f. the hectoltre.
An improvement in the manufaeture of steel, the invention of a M. Chenol, has attracted attention among scientific men here. It has already been honoured with the great medal of the Paris Exhibition, and is, it appears, patented in all countries. In the vicinity of Paris an establishment is formed, and is now producing considerable quantities of the article, and by the new method it woould appear that steel of a superior quality is manufactured direct from iron ore with much rapidity, and at one-third of the present cost. The Invention is now under examination for Austria, and the Swedish Ambassador has suggested the nomination of commissaries for those countries. The following particulars have been communicated to me :-The avstem consists in making steel from the ore, and the principal features of the process are these -the inventor employs, firstly, an electro-sorting machine to separate the crushed ore, ancd to raise it to its m-.nimum standard of pureness and richnessqualities which the steel subsequently retains; secondly, a system of cementation or addition of carbon and other matters by cold process, in such a way that this delicate operation can be repeatedly effected in determined and exact proportions, which results in the production of steel as varied in quality as can be desired, capable of being reproduced with certainty and of identically the same temper and quality. This resmlt is not without its importance to the consumer, as by the simple use of marks and numnbers he can be sure of receiving for any given purpose precisely the same quality of steel with which he had been previously supplied. Thirdly, a compression of the ore after its transmutation, and before or after cementation into a sponge. The ore reduced into a sponge was so liable to be affected by heat or humidity that it could hardly be kept long enough fit for compression; but in consequence of the great reduction in volume of the compressed sponge it is wbrked with an economy of 50 per cent. in fuel and manual labour in welding,
melting, &c., and thus by this second fact the value. of compressing the sponge is evident. The invoentor appears to have given practical proof of the commercial advantages of his system, and it is added that he sold his steel in some quantity to French manufacturers at prices which more than trebled the cost of production without seeking the highest relative prices of Swedish steel, and could thus continue to supply steel of superior quality, not standing him in one-third of the price at which he sold it.. From repeated trials' it is sad that double the wear could be got out of implemenbt manufactured of steel ot this. compressed sponge, compared with those made from good steel of Sheffield marks.m By the same process steel can be manu. factured from Spanish ore, which steel will not cost above 321. pier ton, and be auperior in quality to that sold in Paris at 100Z. per ton. In a word, the inventor. secures these advantages-the manufacture of steel in 10 days instead of 40, the psibility of reprodueing the exact quality of ateeltdesired, and the cost price not to exceed one-third of the present price, relative qualities being borne in mind.

A telegraphic despatch will have informed you, that the Persians, after having lost posses.- sion of Bushire, accepted the conditions of the 13ritish; but it is. not known whether the words, "the British," referred to the expedition to the Persian Gulf or to Her Majesty's Government. Nothing positive is known here respecting the movements of the Ruwsians on the south and south-east coast of the Caspian, but an impression prevails in Austrian official circles that the St. Petersburg Government is for the moment much more inclined to peace than to war. "If," say the professional politicians of this city, "the Russians have occupied. the province of Astrabad, it by no means follows as a matter of course that they intend to advance to-. wards Herat. The St. Petersbure Cabinet has a liking for material guartees, and it will probably hold Astrabad until peace is. concluded between Persia and England, and the latter has withdrawn her forces from the Persian Gulf." A Trieste corresaondent of the Augslurg Gaz.ete explains why the Russian Government is so desirous to obtain from the Persian Monarch the mountainous district of Maku (Mahoo). As the execrable state of the caravan-road from Trebizonde, by way of Erzeroum and Bajazid, to Tabriz has greatly disgusted the mercantile world, the Russians are desirous to open a communication between their Black Sea port, Redout Kaleh, and Tabriz. The proposed caravan road would pass through Tiflis and Erivan, and then run in a southerly direction by way of Maku to Tabriz. It is asserted that the Shah has already ceded the district in question to the Czar; but the fact is, that DIli Khan its actual possessor, has never acknowledged the supremacy of the Persian Monarch. When Ilih Khan was informed by the Governor of Erivan of what had passed between the St. Petersburg and Teheran Governments, he coolly observed, that if the Russians coveted Maku "they should come and take it." Maku,which lies between the Armenian table land and Tabriz, at the northern extremity of the Persian province of Azerbijan, is full of defiles and gorges.. The old caravan-road runs along the bank of the Alsas, a small river which falls into the Araxes, after having worked its way through the mountains of Maku.
Official information has to-day been received that their Majesties will not leave the eapital of Lombardy until the 27th inst. On Wenesday, the 21st, the Emperor inspected many of the public establishments, while the Empress visited some of the convents. Their Majesties were loudly cheered in the evening when they appeared at the Scala, at which theatre there was a grand bal given in their honour by the municipal authorities. It is not probable that either the Em. peror or the Empress daneed, as the latter has not been quite well for some time past; but we learn that the personal appearance of Rer Majesty produced a very favourable impression. on the lyilaneae.
wno, according to their custom, gave most audible expression to their admiration. OnThursday there was a shooting party at Monza, and a concert at Court in the evenig. The morning of yesterday was spent by the Emperor in visiting the barracks.
A few days since-on the 18th, probably-the Archduke Ferdinand Max was received with loud cheers by the people as he drove along. the Corso Francesco. The Milanese know that the youthful Prince is to be the successor of Marshal Rtadetzky, and they probably 'wihed to give him to understand that they were well pleased with the Empeyor's choice. The accounts published by some of the Sardinian papers of the reception given to their Majesties on their arrival at Milan are as false as they are indecorous. The ITnione, for instance, informs ibs readers that the ladies who stood on the balconies of the houses near the Porta Orientale, and waved their handkerchiefs as their Majesties drove to the Cathedral, "w ere 'women of bad character, hired by the police for the occasion." The wrath of the Austrian authorities is great, and you may be assured that the breach between the Vienna and Turin Governments is wider than ever. Sonue of the foreign papers state that the British and Freiich diplomatisti are endeavouring to bring about a reconciliation between Austria and Sardima, but no intelligence hz reached me which could in any ay .tend to coimfirm the statement.
It is, however, stated that the French Minister at Turin has expressed to Count Cavour
the surprise of his Government that io attempt iy made to cheekthe abuse of-the libeyof the press. People here give credit to the foregoing statement, but as lgng as the person and policy of the Emperor Nappleon are held xacred the French Government is not very likely to complain of any undue license on the part of the Sardinian press. During his sojourn at Milan the principal bankers and merchants have paid extreme attention to Baron Bruck, and that satesman has half promised that a discount bank shall be established in the capital of Lombardy. As Austria has promised Parma and Modena to reduce the duty on colonial goods those duchies are likely to consent to renew the (elltoms Duty Treaty.
AIloydbteamer,comingfromDalmatia,hasbrouglht to Trieste some few particulars relative to the Asia. The vessel got aground on a sandy beach during the night of the 12th, which was extremely dark. A strong gale waas blowving from the south-wFest, and a heavy surf rendered assisitance from the shore impoesible. The steamer lay expo>sed to the violence of wind and 'wave some 12 hours before she bega to get leaky, but at noon on the 13th the captain considered it advisable to send the passengers and mail bags on shore. When the crew quitted the ship she was already four or five feet deep in the sand, and every wave made her condition more hopeless. Two Lloyd steamers and the Imperial brig Pylades have gone from Corfa to Vojuzza to endeavour to save the cargo and hull of the vesseL
The Austrian military authorities are continuing their fortifications in Gallicia, and they would, perhaps 'dowelltocompletethemasspeediyasposs&ile. The hatred of Ruasia for Austrla increases from day to day; and the Russians iopenly declare that their Government will seize the frst favourable opportunity which may present itself of being revenged on Austria for her unparalleled ingratitude and "impudence."
It is whispered that the deficit for the year 1856 is about 120,000,000fl. In 1855 it wa-138,89929711. Baron Bruck is said to be in despair that he is unable to keep the expenditure within more reasonable limits.
On the 21st instant orders were sent to the Austrian commanders at Jassy and Bucharest to begin. to evacuate Moldavia and Wallachia on the 1st of March.
This Government has informed Baron Budberg that no Russian subject can in future be admitted into the Austrian dominions unless his passport has the visa of an Austrian Miniser or Consul. It must be supposed that the Imnperial authorities have *onlZ now come to the conclusion that Russian emis-saries may do as much mischief in Austria as the agents of M. Mazni.
PRUJSSIA.

BERLIN, J. 25.
Since the Court took up its residence in Berlin last Tuesday the "Upper Thousand" have been gratified by two brilliant entertainments, the one at the Palace on Wednesday, which concluded with a concert, and the other a public fubscription ball at the Opera-house on Thursday evening. In the arrangements for these Court entertainments and festivities it is amusing to a foreigner to see how the plan of systematic classification which characterizes the whole edifice of the State pervades even the precincts of the Royal Palace. One is led to the convictionthatLinnteus,%but for his shortsightedness, would have made a capital Court Chamberlain, or that every Court Chamberlain here must be a very Linnieus for classification. The distinotions however between heterropoda and ceplauopoda in shells and between hemoptera and Zepidoptera in insects are coarse and palpable when compared with the fine distinctions to be observed hexe between all the differences of military, diplomatic, court civil academical, clerical, legislatorial, and municipa UIniforms and costumes; between all the many varieties and sub-divisions of the 14 orders of which I gave you an account a few days back; between the different ranks of BeZgLrungsrafh, Ober-regierungsrath, Gehewme Ober-reg., Wirkliche Geheime Ober-req., Wit*Uiche Gehelnerath, with the title of Exeellen=. All the latter gentlemen in italics, be it observed, are only some of the employes out of one of the Ministerien or public offices, and whom we should limp all together, with many thousands of their brother officers, under the -one titla of " a gentleman in a Government office." In coiiformity with this all-pervading system of .classificationwe find, on occasion of this late, entertainment at the Palace, that the Princes and Princesses of the Royal family assembled in the Red Velvet-room; the Corps Diplomatique in the Black Eagle-room; their ladies, the foreign Princes, and those bearing the title of Bxzellenz, in the Saloon of the-Kninhts; the Connci31ors of the first and second class, the Chamberlans, the dons of the University and the Academny, the Ober Burgomeister of Berlin, Cc., in the Brandenburg Chamber; the meembers of the H[ouse of Notables in the Redroom' and the members of the House of Depu-ties m the so-called King's-room. At half- past 8 o'clock the reception began by the King and ueen repairing to the Red Velvet-room, where they .welcomed all the members of the Royal Family -assembled there, and proceeding thence through the various apartments above-mentioned and the various link-s of the Court hierarchy as there enumerated, till all the above were exhausted, they received in -the Panelled Gallery all those high officials who in the course of the last year had been nominated Councillors of the first and second class. All this time the Royal party is preceded in its movements by the . Court officers, the superior Court officers, and the
supreme Court officers; while the coflge is closed by the Adjutants-General and the Flugel Adjutants of the King and the Ladies in Waiting on the Queen. Having got so far in thereception of their numerous gtests the Royal. party took tea in the Elector's apartments, and, thus refreshed, proceeded to re-ceive the salutations of all the offlcers of the gar*i son in the Picture Gallery. This military reception did not commence till considerably after 9 o'clock, -so that it was unusually late for Berlin before the whole Court assembled in the White Saloon to be regaled with a concert; and when I add that the musical entertainment did not conclude till 12 o'clock, you may be sure that more than half of the company had, long before it was over, betaken themselves home to their nightcaps.
The subscription ball at the Opera-house is intended to give to the members of the upper and middle circles who are not hof-falhig, or entitled to claim presentation at Court, an opportunity of meeting the Royal Family at a somewhat nearer distance than usuaL This year the arrangements have been stiU more brilliant and tasteFul than they were last year, which was the first year of their recommencement after the lamentable times of 1848. The pit of the Opera-- house was raised to a level with the stage, the boxes all thrown open, the foajers and corridors abundantly furnished with flowers and evergreens, and nothing that gaslight, mirrors, and flowers could produce was omitted to render the house a highly attractive ballroom. At the back of the stage, the external walls of which 'were covered with looldngglasses, so as to reflect the brilliant scene within, the orchestra was stationed on an elevated estrade ; while the passage leading from the Royal box to the concert
room at the back was converted into a tasteful aviary, so that between the pauses of the music the voices of the singing birds were expressing their dissatisfaction at being kept up so late in their lodging of looldng-glass and wire-work. At 9 o'clock the King left the Royal box and descended thestairs leading from it to the ballroom-pit no longerand opened the Polonaise with the Princess of Prussia. Both the Queen and the Prince of Prussia were compelled by alight indisposition to be absent.
Inconmexion wlththis public ball there is a dark and mysterious story in circulation of a large and gloomy vehicle having been observed to draw upaud take its station nearthe Opera-house aloof from the more brilliant equipages,which, on nearer inspection,
p roved to be a furniture van with the tarpaulinga
let down from the roof. This phenomenon of itself would not have attracted much attention had it not bNen that certain pmser-by heard, or thought they heard, the voices of women confined within.
When curiosity and excitement were at the highest a man-servant was observed to raisc and roll up one of the tarpaulings at the side, when two semi-globular figures emerged from the vehicle, and with but little effort descended ge,tly like parachutes to the ground. The fact of the bell-like forms moving glibly along the footwvay
to:the door of entrance and delivering their tickets of admission showed at length that two ladiey,
having found it impossible teXprocure anyprivate equipKge of sufficient dimensions to take in their ball costuiihe; had been. oblitdto resort to the vehicle of a carman that "carefuly removed goods in towxL(r country."

The Bullion Robbery.
-.T-HE BULLION ROBBERI.
IDECISION OF THE JUDGES AS TO THE
PROPERTY -
Mr. Baron Martin and-MrJustice Wiles sat yesterday afternoon in the Exchequer-chaaber, at Westminster, for the purpose of hearing tho several parties claiming to be entitled to the Turkish bonds and other property found in the possession of the prisoners Yierce, Burgess, and Tester, who were convicted of the extensive robbery of bullion upon the South-Eastern Railway.
Mr. Bodkin]uappeared on behalf of the company; Mr. Sleigh, instructed by Mr, A. Croaley, the Under-Sheriff, represented the Sheriffs of London and Middlesex; Mr. Peteradorif appeared on behalf of an attorney named Saward; Mr. Beard, from the offloe of Mr. Buchanan, appeared on behalf of the wife of the prisoner Tester; and Mr. Reynolds, the solicitor for the Treasury, also attended on behalf of the Crown.
Mr. SLEIGH first addressed their Lordships, and con. tended that under the ancient charters granted to the corporation of the city of London tho property of all felons convicted in the city was forfeited, and that the sheriffs, by virtue of their office, ought therefore to have the custody of all the property tohen from tho prisoner Pierce, he being a felon, and allhis goods and chattels being thereby forfeited to the Crown; and the sheriffs, who were the custodians of the Crown, ought therefore to have possessdon of it. He said that from time immemorial the property of the prisoners convicted at tho Old Bailey had been given up to the sheriffs in that capacity, and he believed this was the first time that their right.3 in this respect had ever been contested. He went on to say that he was instructed that it was not the fact that Agar had placed the money he possessed in Pierce's hands for the benefit of Fanny 1sy, but, in soint of fact, he handed it to Mr. Wontner to be given to Betty Pierce, tho wife of thatprisoner, and that there was nothing to show that the whole proceeding was not collusive, with a view to defeat the title of the Crown to the property; nd he urged that the Court had no power under such crcum stances to order the property to be given to Fanny Kay He then referred to the act of the 7th and 8tb of George TV., cap. 57, which relatedto the poer of the judges to order the restitution of stolen property, bat he said that the property now in question was not only not a part of the stolen property, hut a great portion of it was not even the proceeds of it, and he urged that the only course that ought to be taken was to place the property in the hnds of the sheriff3, who would be responsiblforits safe custody, and who would be ready to obey any order that the judges might eventually make respecting it
Mr. PETERSDORSF then briefly ddressed the Court, and claimed, on behalf of his client, to obtain a su of 2601. for costs that had bee) incurred by Mr. Saward in conducting some legal proceedings for the risoner Pierce.
Mr. BEARD, on behalf of Mrs. leter, claimed the pro. perty taken from him, and which, it will be remembered, consisted of certain Spanish bonds, upon a settlement made by the prisoner before his triaL
The JuDozs at once decided that neither of these parties had any legal claim. With regard toMtr. Saward, he could have no right to be paid his debt out of property In which the Crown had atite.; and, with reference to Ars Tester, the bonds in question were distinctly made out to be the result of the proceeds of the stolen gold, and she therefore could claim no right to them.
Mr. BODYi said that, on behalf of the company, all he asked of the Court was to order that the property -which was undoubtedly the produce of the robbery that had been committed upon them should be delivered up. They had paid 10,0001. as the value of the gold that had been stolen and the company only desired that they should be treated like other prosecutors, and have restored to them that which was clearly made out to be the produoe of the stolen property. He then said that it was proved at the trial that 5001. of the purchase money of the Turkish bonds was the result of five of the 1001. notes that were obtained for gold at the Bank of England, and about 4001. more that were in the hands of Messrs. Reid, the brewers, with whom it had been placed by Mr. Stearn, the publican, on behalf of Burgess. These two sums were clearly shown to have been the produce of
he gold that was sold by P?ierce and Agar, and which was divided among the prsoners, and it appeared to him that the comPany w ere clearly entitled to this money, and that

Mr. SnxGHx said he should not oiler any objection to this amount being given to the company, but he contended that the sheriffs ought to have the custody of the re. mainder on behalf of the Crown.
Mr. Justice WiLLrs expressed his opinion that the sherilffs bad not made out a c.se that would justify the Court in making the order they prayed for. They professed to be acting in the interest of the Crown, but the Solicitor for the Treasury was present, who was the direct party to interfere.
M1r. SLxriGHsaid the sheriffs had nodesire to do more than what they conceived to be their duty in vindicating the rights of the corporation.
After some further disussion
Mr. RXYNOLDS said that under ordinary circumstances the property of a felon was taken possession of by the Crown, but it was never retained when any persons made out a good case for its restoration. In some instances it had been restored tothe felon himself for good conduct, and also to his wife, andthe Treasury, in fact, always endeavoured to act according to the equity of each case.
Mr. Baron MASTIN expressed his opinion that Fanny Ray-had an equitable right to the property, according to the request of Agarn.
Mr. BODKIN said that, on the part of the company, he had no interest, except inthat portionof the propertlwhich was proved to be the produce o the robbery; but he sug. gested that, if the remainder were to be given to the woman Say, the interests of the child ought to be taken care of, and that a proper settlement should be made for that purpose.
Mr. SLEiGH said that if M1r. Beynolds would take charge of the property, and see that it was distributed in the man. ner that had been suggested, he would at once, on the part of the sherias,withdraw from making any furtherclaine.
Mr. RYOLDS intimated that he was not anxious to undertake the responsibility of distributing the property.
Mr. S,EIOGI said that surely the Court would not think d ecent, or in accordance with the due administration of justice, that a large sum of money like this should be retainedin the hands of a policeman; and that it would be a much more decorous ptoceedingWforthe property to be placed in the hands of the sheritEs.
Mr. BODRIN said that he understood that the city actuaUy claimed the m.oney, and if the bonds went into their possession they would set up their rights in this respect, and the greater portior, of the proyerty would be wasted in law.
Mx. SLEIGH said he was instructed that no such claim was intended to be set up. The sheriffs only desired to assert what they conceived to be their rights.
Mr. Baron L&nrTw said the sheriffs appeared to have acted very properly in the matter, but he did not think they bad made out their right to have the property placed in their custody.
Some further discussion then took place, and eventually the judges made an order that the company should have restored to them so much of the property as was shown to be the result of the robbery, and that the remainder should be given into teecustodyof Sir Richard Mayne, the Chief Commissioner of Police, to abide any future orders that may be given respecting it.

Marylebone Theatre.
MARYLEBONE THEATR.
A little girl named Cordelia Howard, who by her preco. cious talents has attained great celebrity in the United States, is engagedl at the Maryleboue Theatre, where she represents the character of Eva In a version of Uncle Tosh Ca6in not familiar to the almdiences of western London, miany as ire the dramatic forms that Mrs. Stowe's novel has assumed for the amusement and instruction of play. goers. In this version the interest is chiefly centred in the family of St. Clair, and while Uncle Tom himself beomes a subordinatepersonage, the death of Evais the pathetic climax of the story. The charm of thorepresentation is thatthelittle girl is layed by a little l ,with every appearance of childhood aboub her. The plTayfulness is childish, the serious admonitions given to Topsey are childish in their solemnity, and a pretty song cailed "Eva to her papa," is warbled forth by the dying little saint in childish tones proper to the occasion. Not a few-tears are shed by the auajence, for the piece, though on the whole, a sorr work of dramatic art, isso contrived that the little inte gent girl is always an interesting figure, and her decline to the grave seems the decese of a real favourite. Hence n3o small consolation ii derived when, as St. Clair dies in the last scene, a little ghostly Eva nses at the back of the stage, with every appearance of belonging to a better world.
Miss Cordelia Howard Is not lonely in the land, but comes under tha protection of her father and mother, Mr. nod Mrs. G. C. Howard, who play thecharacters of St. Clair and Topy. The former of these parts demands little more than good looks and geatlemanlike deportment, and both these exigencies are answered by Mr. Roward. The latter is a very singular creation on the part of the actress, who does not so much essay to render TopEey oomical as to depict a low nature, in which the ferocious animal forms an important element of the composition. A strange song, "J J'se so wicked," in which, by the most frantic gestures and the most piercing shrieks, she indicates her exultation at her own depravit, is a sort of thing that has never been heard before. Let us add that native judges declare this portraiture of the negrems of the Southern States to he perfectly accurate, and that therefore it may be accepted as a vehicle for ethnological instruction.

(Before thc LORD, CH CELLon.) j
This caso was argued before -ila Lordship a short ttme bck and stood over for judgment. The circumstances vhich gave rise to the petitionZ6ero as follows :-John Tharp, the testator in the cauEe, by -will dated Mlarch, 1801 devised certain esttes in the island of Jamaica to troes for the benefit of his grandson, Johni- Tharp, the younger, for his life. Among such eRtates -was one ca11e Lansquinet, which was chaged with an annuity of 1,200. current money of Jamaica to the widow of the testtor, under a marriage settlement dated October, 1794. The first suit for the administration of the testator's estates was insituted as far bak as the year 1805. In the year 1816 John Tharp, the grndson, was found a lunatic by inquisition, and has continued so down to the present time. The sugar plantations have been carried on by the different consnocs appointed by the Court at an enormous loss, and
eir claim now amounts to a sum exceeding 200,0001. The Lansquinet ostate and the income arising from the slave compensation fund awarded to it were insufficient to pay the annuity of 1,2001. Jamvica csrrency to the testator's widow, and there was due in resect of the arrears at the time of her death, whiuch took plao on the 3d of March, 1847, a sum of 1,3201. It also appeared that the consignees had paid to the widow on account of her annuity from time to time more money than the Lansquinet estate and the slave compensation fund produced, and they accordingly obtained an order fromn this Court in July, 1853, for the Master in Lunacy to take the accounts, with a viewv of ascertaining the amount due from the Lanaquinet estate, the slave compensation fund, and the genec residuary estate of the testator. Upon proceeding to take such accounts, it appeared that the consignees' accounts had been passed in lunacy between the 2-4th of May, 1818, and the 30th of April, 1817, and a question was raIsed whether such accounts ought to be received as evidence of the proper payment by the consignees and managers of the several disbursements therein set down, or whet er the accounts ought not to be retaken, inasmuch as the parties interested in the estates in remainder were not presont at the pasing of such accounts, and had not, therefore, had any opportunity of checking

The LORD CNCErLLoR this morning delivered judemnenu and, after going through all the facts of the case In
sea, aid that although he commiserated the position of the consignees he did not see any way of assisting them. The difficulty haed been caused by themselves in not keeping the accountsof the Lansquinet estate separate from the other accounts. Had that been done the owners of the inheritance would have had an opportunity of inquiring into the management of the property, and have had a voice in the appointment of the manager. Probably the estates would not have been managed any better by such an interference but it did not hei the mouths of the consigneesto make such an assertion. Asthe matter, however, tben stood the consignees had had the sole appintment and control of the managers, and the accounts of the two could not be separated, The petition must therefore bo dismissedwith costg.

The plaintiff was a commercial traveller in the house of
Yates and Co., lArge butter salesmen, in Old fish-street, Cit The defendant was a very large grocer, at heading, anbdtoe action was brought to recover damnges for aplibel contained in a letter written by the defendant to Messrs.
Yates and Co. The alleged libel impated to the plaintitf that in a sale of some butter he had been guilty of ieadding falshodd to falsehood, and had made a misrepresentation, and requethe haintif wy hmght note ddarken their doors atain. 8essrwrYatepn rletei,vasking this letter, told the
prainw tha,ules heaato clere himsoelftfro this dempdatrease The plaintiff detaied the facts relative to the sale of the butter, stating that he tdithe defendant that he had recently opened some of Hayden's butter in the presence of Mr. Copeland, of Norwich, and that it was equal, in their opinion, to O'Shaunessy's butter.
In a letter put in, ande which wa written by the plaintiff to the defendaut, the plaintiff stated that, instead of not darkening his doors again, he ought to have odarkened his
ma. topesudk oft; anorifaman statd tt the hbadcalied the p aintiffyto se e s t e o Ha y de n s ba utter, an d th ey fo u n d it
grosslyeeat misconucsubted thatel, this wua a privilegdo The learnedJUDErsaid if the language exceeded what the occasion required it was for the jury to say whether they would give damages for theexcess. hte did not think
there was personal malice, but an advantage taken of the occ tifon to use maliciouslanguage.
Mr. Serjeant Suh E then addressed the jury for the defendant. A bargain had bIen made between these parties for an absolute sale of 50 firkins of Hayden's butter, and
the question was as to what actually took plae at the tien of the sale; and ho shouldl prove that the defendant
was induced to make the purchase on a representation. that Hayden's butter was equal, if not superior to
O'Shaunessys butter, for the defendant knew nothing of
Hayden's butter before that time. He therefore sutbmitted that the letter was written on an occasion which justified it.
The letr was written to the plaintiff's employers,co.a d plainuing that the butter was not such as had been repre. sented. The defendant believed at the time he wrote the letter thst the butter had been misrepresented to him and the language was provokeclbya previous letter he hadrreceived Khm Mr. Donelly. Altogether the letter was justified by the circumstances.
The defendant said that the plaintiff had told him that Hayden's buttrs were as f.ne as O'Shaunessy's, and that to prove it he had seen Hayden's and O'Shatnessy's opened together only two days before, and Hayden's were the best. Upon this he ordered 50 firkins, and 50 more, subject to the first bein, tapproved. Witness had afterwards told a brQulh at the butters were equall He did so upon the represntation of the plaintiff. Haydens buLtters were not equal.
Cross-examined.-Had sold all the butter 'wholesae at 110r. He had given YaLtes and Co. I06s.
Robinson, who is in the employ of the defendant, recollected the plaintiff callinf at the defendant's, and saying, "1We consider HaydlenaLs superfine butter equal, if not superior, to O'Shaunessys," and that he had seen them both opened. 'The 50 firldns had been sent on approval.
Mdr. JAmrx% in reply, contended that the letter was uncalled for and maU& A party who wrrote a letter of complaint, honestly and bond ,)We, would be justified, and he would be protected hubt here the defendant had charged the plaintiff with having acted dishonestly, and thereby entrapped him into otat The plaintiff, long afteral
this, had written A letter, asking the defendLant to withdraw his imputation of dishonesty;- the defendant refused. to do this, and fput upon the recordI a reiteration of the charge. The do fondant had absolutely sold the butter at a profit, but he had the option of sending it back. The defendant had endeavoured to "1brand"1 the plaintiff as a diehonest man; he came to the Court to ask for relief.
Mr. Justice ERLE, in summing, up, said thore were many occasions in life when it might be the bounden dutY Of a masn to speak out; and if a man stood in the relation of a buyer with the traveller of a house, and. the traveller had grossly misconducted himself, the buyer had a right to write to the employer of the party statini what had occurred, and. the jury might in such a cae thin~ the lettor justified. If a party honestly believed what he wrote to be true, and confined himself te a reasonable statemeont, he was justified ; but if he used intemperate and excessivo langag.e, beyond what the circumstances justified, a jury would protect the party so injured. In the present case the defendant naid that what he had stated was tree, and that the plaintiff
adfalsely and dishonestly mnade a misrepresentation. He (the learned judge) did not see any ground for believing that the plaintiff had so misconducted himself. It was for the jury to say whether the letter was such as they thou ht the occasion would justify. They knew the reiultofsocx
libeL. If they saw no reasontothink that theoplaintiff had not acted unbecoming the situation of a traveller toa hiurhly

OORTO1;, APrELLANT, V. WIDDERS, RESPONDENT. This was an appeal from the County Court of Bow.
Mr. Atherton, Q.C., appeared for the appellant; and Mr. Baddeley for the respondent.
The action was brought for goods sold and delivered. The defendant had accepted bills of exchange for the amount due, and sent them to the plaintiff; the plaintiff had, however, returned these bills by letter. When the plaint caine on for hearing the defendant contended that he bad paid for the goods by bils of exchange which might be lost, and he would be liable for their amount, and that the plaintiff ought to have sued him on the bills of exchange. The learned judge overruled this objection, and allowed the plaintifftorecover forthe goodssold and delivered. Against thiu ruling the defendant appealed.
Mr. ATHIERTOw having been heard in support of the appeal, Mr. Baddeley was not called upon.
The LORD CnRmi JumTICE was of opinion that the appeal must he dismissed. Substantial justice had been done. It was clear on the facts that the bills had got back into the hands of the acceptor. Was it, then, incumbent on the plaintiff to sue on these bills and give the defendant notice to produce them, or might he treat the bills as never havi been given, and sue on the original consideration ? The h~ils having found their way hack to the defendant's
hands, the plaintiff, he was of opinion, was fully entitled to sue on the original consideration, and the judge was perfectly jtsstiSed in coming to the opinion that lie had done. The appeal must therefore he dismissed with
The other learned Judges concurred. Appeal dismissed with costs.

NE%v TRTAL PAPER.
n wr.vae at str s t Y
(SUting in Banco.)
This was an action in which the piaintiff, who is an Irish drover, sought to recover damages from the defendant a
magistrate of the Isle of Ely, for having wrongfuily | remanded him to custody for four days on a charge preferred by the Eastern Counties Railway Company, and also for having wilfully, maliciously, and without probable cause, convicted him at the expiration of his former imnprisonment upon another charge by the same company. At the trial beforo Lord Campbell at tho last Cambridge assizes it appeared that on Saturday night, September the 22d, the p1rintiff took a drover's ticket from Norwich to London, and proceeded by the mail train as far as Ely, when he was asked to show his ticket. The plaintiff, after some delay, into which it is now immaterial to enter, ultimnately gave his ticket, which, on being examined, purported to have been issued on the 2d of Se tember. Objection being made that this was an old tic et, the plaintiff protested that he had got it and paid the f.are that night at Norwich. The raUway officials doubted this, as he had other oldl tick-ets about him, but offered to let him proceed to London on payment of the fare, which was to be returned to him if it turned out that his story was correct. The plaintiff was unable to comply with this offer, and he was forthwith taken into custody, and kept till the Monday, when he was brought up before the defendant, a clergyman and magistrate, on a charge of having travelled on the raUway without having first boeked and paid his fare, contrary to the by-law of the company. The plaintiff then repeated his defence, and the defendant remanded him till inquiries could be made at Norwich into the facts. On Tuesday it was ascertained that the plaintiff's tale was correct, and that the stamping machine had omitted the figure " 2'' on the ticket which had been produced to the defendant. As soon as this was known the raUway officials thereupon consulteda 1awyer, who advised them that, though the first information had failed, the plaintiff was yet liable to another for refusing to show and deliver his ticket under another bylaw, and this being made known to the defendant, he granted another information on that second charge, which was served on the plaintiff as he was quitting the justice-room on being discharged froni the first information. On the Thursday followiing the plaintiff appeared before the defendant and two other justices, when. he was convicted and ordered to pay 5s., and ordered to be committed for 14 days, on default of payment or distress. The plaintiff paid the money at once, and appealed against the conviction, which was quashed by the quarter sessions. Upon this actions were brought against the railway company by the plaintiff and by his employer, which were compomised, and the present action against the magistrate.
rd Chief Justice ruled that the defendant was protected a,ainst the first count, as he was acting within his jurisdiction, ut the jury assessed 201. contingent damages, with leave' to theo plaintiff to move to enter a verdict for that sum, which motion was duly made and a rule granted. As to the second cause of action, the Chief Justice ruled that there was evidence of a want of reasonable and probable cause for the conviction by the defendant, and left it to the jury to say whether he had also acted maliciously. On
this count the uy found malice, and save the plaintiff 51 damages, in addition to the costs incurred by him in quashin' the conviction (which was a condition precedent to the right to bur the action), and taxed at 781. by the officer of
the court. n this count the defendant, in a former term,
tainedarnleto enter the verdicton thegronnd of the absence of evidence of malice and want of probable cauae, and also in
rrest of judgment, on the round that no action would lie aganst a magistrate foractingjudiciay, no act of trespass havng eendon byhi orordredby iswarrant to be Mr. PALiIgR and Mr. J. R. MILLS now showed cause against the last rule, and contended that no action would lie under the circumstances of the caso, the 11th and 12th Victoria, cap. 44, section 1I providing that no action should be brought against a justice of the peace without alleging that he acted maliciously and without probablo cause, and cited innumerable cases of actions against justice where no such objection as this had ever been raised on behalf of a jstice. As to the question whether the finding of mnalice was supported, they re lied on the broad fact that the defendant had lent himself to the railway auxthorities and had coruptly convicted the plaintiff on the charge of refusing to deliver up his ticket at a time when he actually had in his possessin the very tiekcet which the plaintiff was charged to have refused to deliver.
Mlr. Serjeant BYqtEs , with whom was Mr. Couch, in support o the rule, argued that this action was virtually one agains a magistrate for acting corruptly in the disd charge ofa judicial dnty,-misconduct which ought to bethe subject of crioninal process, rather than an action for damages. As far as the conduct of the defendant wa concerned, it was clear that he had acted in a friendly way towards the plaintiff in the first instance. As to the second count there was no actual trespass in the act of conviction.

The firstecount of the declantion alleged that the defendant seduced one TEmma Staggall, the plaintiffs stepdaughter and servant, and deprived him of her services. The second count charged the defendant with wilfully and maliciously enticing the plaintiff's aervant to leave his service; and the third count aileged that the plaintiff's servant having wrongfully left hibs service, the defendant harburedher nd ept er fom rturing to her duties.

This -was, perhaps, the first " seduction" case in which the injured girl was not called as a witness; bet it was not in the power of the plaintiff, in the present action, to produce his stepdaugl4er, whiom the defendant had seduced.

She left her home on t'he 27th of Augut last year, andab she ws not fliscovered until the 16th of October +hen she was foundl living *1th thea defendant as his wife A6 BZrith, in Kent., The plaintiff, on bearkne this, inmmediately went to Erithband brought his st6l5daugh tor home, whore uncle in the country, Th-ese f-cts woultd beprovred,andahe

Mr. Baron BRsWEIM said, in his opinion there was no case opened by the learnedcounsel. Eesawnothingwbich would prevent Emma Stagai terminating her services at ,%ill, anad-the plaintiff could not recover unless the defendant took her away during the continuance of the service. However, the 'plaintiff's case had better go on.
The following evidence was then adduced in support of the plaintiff's case:-
George RandalL-I am a licensed victualler at Rtherhithe. Emma Staggall is my stepdaughter. She used to reside with me. She used to do work in the bar, andidid domestic work. She always received pocket money and clothes. I know the defendant, and I have done so for nine years. He is a contractor in the service of the Commercial Dock Company at Botherhithe. My stepdaughter left my house in August last. I was not at home when she went ,way. She did not return until I fetched her in October. I made inquiries about her, and employed Mr. Stanley to search for her. I went with Stanley on the 16th of October to Erith, in Kent. I wenb to No. 5, Pier-road, at Erith. I saw the defendant with Emma Stag all. I went up to him and said, "This is my daughtor-in-law." She said, "Good God, is that you?' I said, " Yes, you must go home with me." She said she would go anywhere with me. The defendant said nothing, but -walked away. They were living as Mblr. and Mrs. George Barnes. The defendant said, " This is a - bad job." I said I thought it was. He asked sue if I was a man of the world. I told him I thought I was old enough. I took my stepdaughter away with me. Before she left Erith she said she was very happy to go home. When I served the defendant with the writ in this action he asked me if it could not be settled. I said it was in the hands of my solicitor. Two boxes were sent to my house for Emma after she returned. In those boxes I found these two letters, which I can swear are in the bandwriting of the defendant. [The letters were signed G. B., and contained a request to Emma Staggall to meet G. B. at the Brighton Railway terminus at London-bridge.] Emmawas very ill aftershe returnedhome. I owe my medical man a bill for attending on Emma after she returned home. I have paid Stanley 311. for tracing her. I met the defendant afterwards, and he asked me if it could not be settled, and I said " No; ou deceived my daughter by telling her that your wife was suffering from an inward complaint, and was given over by all the doctors in London; and that as soon as she died you would marry her. After the kindness you have received at my house I should as soon have suspected my own brother." He made use of an oath and walked away, and I have never spoken to him on the subject since.
[None of the witnesses were cross-examined by the learned counsel for the defendant.]
Irs. Ann Randall.-I know the defendant. Emmna was absent from our house from August until the 16th of October. She used to assist me in the bar and in the household work. I had to employ my niece during her absence. When Emma returned she was very ill. I dared not leave her alone. She continued il a week or 10 days. She never attended in the bar, nor did any household work afterwards. She did not act in the house as an ordinary servant. If I had no daughters I should have to employ a barmaid. I saw the defendant after she left, but I did not speak to himn about her. During the time she was ill she twice attempted to make away with herself. In consequence of that we felt great anxiety about her. When she came home she had two rings on her fingers. She said she was very sorry she had gone away. She made various statements to' me. I sent her to my brother's. She is 19 years old. She was only a child when she fist knew the defendant. The defendant had frequent opportunities of seeing Emma, as she was in the habit of attending upon him at our house. The pocket-money and clothes which she received from us were more than a servant would have had for wages.
The medical man who attended Emma Staggall during her ilness was called, but his evidence was immaterial,
At the conclusion of the plaintiff's case
Mr. Baron BRA.nvELL again said that, in his opinion, the plaintiff had not made out- continuous service, and therePore he could not recover.
The plaintiff was nonsuited accordingly.
The Court rose at 1 o'clock to-day, having finished the cases set down for trial for these sittings.

Kohler, of Maiden-lane, queen-atreet,Cheapside, inconsequenceofanapplicationfrom tle proprietors. 1 searched the premises, and found on the second floor a quantity of skins lying about, and the loopbole of the first floor, from which a person could getintothe street, open, and on Monday night last I went to the same warehouse and found the padlock had been forced oft the door leading from the street into the cellar under the warehouse, and I found that some boards leading into the warehouse had been broken away. The aperture was large enough to admit a man. The warehouse was secured, and a man was left in charge till Monday mornirng, when, on the arrival of the clerk, I searched the premises. I found that r. desk in the office on the ground floor had been forced open, and that the clasp of the keyhole of the iron safe had been forced down and apparently with somne instrument, but the safe had not been opened. I found a ladder in the cellar, placed in such a position as to assist a person in getting out at the flap doors.
Knight, 437, said,-Last night, between 6 and 7 o'clock, the prisoner was brought by his father to the police-station in Bow-lane, and in consequence of instructions which I received I went to No. 97, Britannia-street, City-road, when a young woman who lived there gave to me six sample walking sticks, and a comb and a cap. The prisoner gave up to his father in my presence five duplicates which relate to property stolen on each of the occasions on which the warehouse had been entered. I produce a pair of boots which were taken off the feet of the prisoner in the stationhouse.
Eliza Cox, of Britannia-street, City-road, said the prisoner occasionaUy visited her, and on Sanday evenin
between 6 and 7 o'clock, he brought to her place the sample sticks and comb and cap produced, stating that he had brought them from Lowestoft.
The prisoner was remanded, Kninght having stated that he would b e able to prove that the articles produced were pnart of the property which had been stolen from Messrs. Kiohier's premises.
The LORD MAYO requested that the press would acknowledge his receipt of the following benefaction for the poor. box:-" The poor ye have always with you," if.
GUILDL.-Bobert Clipson was charged with robUr. Samnel Seymour Lowden said he kept the Peacock Tavern on Addle-hill, Doetors'-cormmons. The prisoner was in his employ as potboy for about two months, and on Monday evening, about a uarter to 9 o'clock, he found the prisoner in his (witness's) bedroom. He was concealed under the bed, and pretended to be asleep. On being brought out he was asked what he had been doing, but he made no reply. Witness found a writing-desk, in which he kept his money, broken open, and about 6R abstracted therefrom. On being searched 25s. in silver was found upon the prisoner, who acknowledged that he had taken it from the desk.
Policeman Lee, 34^6, said when he took the prisoner iato custody he said he had taken the silver, hut he knew nothing about the gold his master had accused him of stealing.
The prisoner was then committed for trial.
William Edney, a young man in the employ of a bookseller at the west-eu, was brought up on Monday on remand, charged with indecently assaulting a respectable married woman named Woodward
The prisoner's master gave him an exceUent character,
Alderman C,RTER said he was satisfied that the prisoner had committed a6 gross and dastardly assault upon a respectable woman, and it was necessary that persons of the prisoner's character should be made to understand that they could not be permitted to insult respectable persons with impunity. It was a much too serious matter for himt to deal lightly -with, and for the sake of protecting the public it was his duty to make an example of the prisoner. If it had not been for his otherwise good character he should have sent him to prison for six months, but under the present circnmstances he fined the prisoner 5&, or two months' imprisonment.
he fine was paid.
Bow-sTnEET.-Mr. JARDI was called upon yesterday to decide a somewhat difficult and novel question under the Hackney Carriage Act.
The complainant, James Shaw, is the driver of one of Wilson's cabs, Long-yard, Lambs'.Conduit-street, and the summons was taken out against Mr. Houghton, silk mercer, &c., of 83, Edgeware-road. One day last week, when the rain and sleet were pouring down, and the wind was in full force, Mr. Houghton hailed the complainant in Holborm, and desired to be driven to his business establishment at the corner of the New-road, as above. It was a Hansom cab, and consequently open in front; but, in spite of the weather, the defendant did not let down the window. The cabman seeing that the lining and cushions of his vehicle would soon be saturated "rernested the gentleman to close the window," but Mr. Houghton refused to do anything of the sort. The cab. man urged that his roperty would be destroyed, and the cab would be rendered unfit for any subsequent passenger, who might summons himn if the cushion, &c., proved to bewet. The defendant, however, asserted his rightto keep the carriage open, and insisted on doing so. The cabman then refused to take him any further, upon which the defendant ordered him to drive to Bow-street police-
On the arrival of the disputants at Bow-street the presiding magistrate, Mr. JARDLN}, after hearing the state. ments pro and con., hesitated to decide the question without some consideration; but his worship granted a summons against 3Mr. Houghton for the sixpenny fare, in order that the matter might come before him properly in the ordinary way.
iThe complainant and defendant being now in attendanuc,
_pursuance of the above arrangement,
Mr. JABDRI?S said it was an unfortunate thing for the cabman that he (the magistrate) did not look into the act of Parliament when this case first came before him, because he might have decided the question at once, without putting him to the trouble and loss of attending again, there being no doubt about the law upon the subject. It did certainly appear to him (Mr. Jardine) a little unreasonable that any man should insist on exposing himself and the interior of a cab to the rain and snow on such a day as the one in question, and no doubt it was very hard upon the cab proprietor, whose property must be injured to a much greater extent than could be met by the mere fare; but his impression of the law was that the cab must be regarded as a kind of open carriage, the option of closing it being left with the passen. ger. This being the law of the case, it was undoubtedly the duty of the cabman to have proceeded w:th his fare; and havingl declined to do this the defendant was justified in ordering him to Bow-street. This mnust be his dlecision, and, howeveropplsed to hisfeelings in the matter, there was no help for it -ut, as the decision ought to have been given at once, he ifr. (Jardine) would return him the cost of the summons, considering that he had already lost half-a-day by having to appear again.
The sumimons was accordingly dismissed.
MAeYLEnONE.-Mr. Thomas Green, a barrister, residing at 2, Sunderlaud-terrace, Westbourne-park, was brought before Mr. BROUGHTON charged with creating a disturb. ance at the house of Mr. Henry Brown, registrar of births and deaths in the district of St. Mary, P'addington, and wilfuly damaging a book with the view of erasing a name therefrom.
The defendant, in reply to the magbistrate, said that his .chamnbers were at 3, King's Bench-walk, Temple.
Mr. Brown (the complainant), on being sworn, said,-I reside at No. 15, Blomfiedd-terrace. This day the defendant came to mY house and asked me to alow him to make an alteration in the Chritian pnames of his child, which wasregistered on theaIst inst. The said childawas bon mon the 8th of December. He broughtto mes paper purporting to be a copy of the haytismal register made at the churbh. The name of the chil registered by me, was Charles Pickering Green. I told him that the paper he brought to mne was not sufficient to justify me in makidng any alteration, and he must produce a particular form, as required bywac dof arliament in such cases. He treated the mat tertvs lightly, and asked to see the entry in yly books showed it to him, and he thentook up the book which wasIg on mv desk, and proceeded to obliterate tbo entry of t Christian names of the child, which were entered as Charles Pickering Green,h ing takwenup a pen to do so which was lying on the desk.mhien I raw what he was doing I made a rush towards bim to prevent his doing further injury, and a scuffle ensued between us. I held him, and sent for a"pohlieman, into whose custody I gave him.

Mr. BROUGHONTe (to defendant4.)Do you wish to make any answer to this charge?
Defendant.- WhatlIdid was without athought. I meant nothing wilful I confess that what I did was extremely foolish and wrong.
Mr. Brown, in addition to whathe hadbefore stated, said, about 10 days ago defendant called upon him in order to make an alteration in the names, and he (Mr. Brown) then told him that he must bring a printed form properly flledup
Mr. BsoUaGHToX said it was a grave and serious offence; these registers were public records and of vast importance, and he should remand the defendant till Tuesday next, but would allow him to enter into his own recognizance in 5001. to be forthcoming on that day.
-W6b5Rt 1-STnlarE.-George Steptoe, William Bonner, .BQbert Frake, Charles Geary, and Thomas Baiskes wera c.hilargea with being concerned in the following robbery.
., A man named Evans, a milkman in luntingdon-street Hpzton, had a cowshed in the East-road, City-road, whera
E half-past 5 in the evening of the 9th inst he had six *mUlch cows, which he foddered, and, carefully fastened the -gates after him when he left. At half-past 8 he went sg~ain to look after them, and tohis astonishment discovered that four of them, worth 901., had been stolen. He gave information to the police, who made inquiries about them, and they, or rather their remain, , were traced in this manner :-A girl named Statbam, whle at work in the OCityroad at half-past 6, saw Steptoc tampering with the lock
of the cowhouse, and a bricklayer named Saberton at 8 o'clock saw the gates thrown opehn and four cows come out, followed by a man whom he believed to be Bankes,; while a greengrocer in Pitfield-street, saw the cows pass his door,
foBowed by two men, of whom he could swear Steptoe wasone. Budd, a dairyman, was passing through Charles-street, Mile-end, at 9 o'clock, when he saw two men much bothered with four cows, 'whom they could not get into Ne. 7 there, and he therefore assisted them, but afterwards heard the cattle had been stolen, and informed the police. Watts, Maveety, and Burrows, three constables, therefore went to this place, which turned out to be an unlicensed slaughterhousetenantedb Geary, and there, in the baek premises, they discovered the carcases of two of the cows hanging up, the beasts being in good condition and properly slaughtered, while the skins of all four were found in a corner, and at once identified as his by Mr. Evans. Bonner was taken in the kitchen of the house, and Geary on coming in said he was at Stratford at the time the beasts were sent to his premises, that one was slaughtered before he got
iome, and that, hasing assisted to kill the others, ho had sold the carcases of two to a butcher in the neighbourhood by direction of theman whohad brought them, While this was going on a man dropped into the street from the fistt-floor window, who was believed to ha Bankes, and who was afterwards taken,; while Steptoe, on being captured, said he had been only employed to drive the easts by a stranger, bat a kidney or tongue was found cookg im a anCepau on the top of his grate. The day after the robbery Geary and Steptoe called on a butcher named Borrittto offer beef for sale, describing the quality as verygood, audBorritt, who had bought scores of carcases of Geary before, found four caresses hanging in that prisoner's slaughterhouse. Geary as-ed 3s per stone. bat
orrtt would not give more than 2s. 8d., which Geary accepted; and Borritt, who had agreed to give 321. for the whole, having removed two of the carcases to his own house, went back for the others, but found in the interim the police had taken them off. He saw at once, upon lookinat them, that they must have been cows "which were killedl in the mnilk."
essrs. Mitchell, tallow-melters, of Whitechapel, proved tat on the day after the robbery Geary, whom they had dealt -with for years, sold their scalesman 10 atone weight of cow fat at 3s pcer stone, while a tripe-dresser named La hert spoke to buying four " offals"from GearyIat S. each.
Steptoe nowr threwthe blame apon Bankesand another man not in cusbtody, who, he said had employed him to drive the beasts to Geary's, to whose wife he delivered them, with directions for her husband to slaughter and sell t'he whole on commission, Bankes declared this to be the most awful fabrication of faLsehoods imaginable; Mr. Vann, for Bonner, clained his discharge, which was acceded to, as was that of Frake, who appeared to have been taken by some unlucky misadventure only; and Mr. Lewis, of Elyplace, for Geary, who had surrendered on bail, contended that there was not a tittle of evidence against his client
whose conduct throughout had been perfectly fair and open.
Mr. D'EYNcoURT did not think there was so strong a case against Geary, whom he would therefore again admit to bail, but he should send the whole for trial at the Old Bailey, Bankes and Step e for the robbery, and Geary for receiving the property, tnowing it had been stolen.
Geary was therefore admitted to bail, and the others removed to Newgate in the van.
LAsmETH.-From 50 to 200 persons, many of them youths of 18 or 19 years of age, marched in a body fromLambeth workhouse to this court and forwarded a document, of which the following is a copy, to Mr. ELLIOTT, the sitting magistrate-
"Sir,-I am delegated to the onerous duty of conducting peaceablyanumber of destitute working men to the parish for such casual relef as the law allows, aud having done so and been refused, Inowappealto yonto directme in the course I shall pursue, as lam answerable to the committee of the unemployed recently met in Smithfield for implicit obedience to your orders.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant,
"CHLARLE.S FLETCHER.P ',To the Magistrate of the district of Iambeth."
Mr. ELLIOTT, on reading the document, desired that one, two, or half-a-dozen of the parties who might be selected by those of the crowd as their advocates or spokesmen might be admitted, and in a few minutes a deputation of three made their appearance in the court. One of them, Charles Fletcher, who described himself as a journeyman painter, but who was much better dressed than the majority of workmen of that class, entered the witness-box, and, addressing the magistrate, said that, agreeable to the instruc. tions of the secretary to the committee of the unemployed working men who had met in SmithfLeld some days ago, he took a number of persons who were, as well as himself, settled in that parish for relief, but it was refased them unless they worked three hours for half-a-pound of bread This they refused, though some of them had been without food from the day before; for this reason, that if compelled to do three hours' work in the workhouse for the tmall amount of relief afforded them they should be spending the time there that it would be necessary to look out for work elsewhere, and this would be exceeding I detrimental to their getting work.
Mr. ELLIoTT observed that no doubt it was the duty of the parish officers to afford such relief to them and their famulies as the emergency of their ease required, but suchrelief mustbe subject to the roles and regulations of the board of guardians, and which rules and regulations he (Ur. Elhott) had not the power to alter. He would, however, send an officer with them to the workhouse to request that relief was afforded them.
Fletcher here said that the required relief had been afforded to the applicants at ClerkenweU and other parishes.
Mr. ELLTorr here directed Coster, 106 1 one of the warrant offlcers, to accompany the applicants and the pairty to lambeth workhouse, and to request the relieving officer to take down the names of the applicants, and give them such temporary relief as the necessities of themselves and their famlies required until they could attend the board and have their respective cases inquired into and properly attended to.
Coster at once obeyed the magistrate's directions, and on his return, in about three quarters of an hour, informed Mr. ELTxoTT that on reaching the workhouse he found that the board of guardians were then sitting, and he at once proceeded to the board-room and informed the chairman and the members of the board of the message he had been sent with by his Worship. The board at once consented to hear the application. or complaint of a deputation of the workmen, as they represented themselves, and he (Coster) took a message to the parties to that effect, but they one and all declined; Mr. Jarret, one of the relieving officers, also offered the parties, in -his presence, tickets for labour in the workhouse gnd for which labour they would have been yaid accoroing to their necessities and the numnber of their families, but they refused to ccept them and marchea off in a body.
Mr. ELLIOTT observed that he was not surprised or disappointed at the result, believing, as he did, that the object of the parties was more display than actual want or a desire to seek parochial assistance.

REFORM ASSOCIATIONS.-Extra-constitutional
ELFORM A"S0O oNS.-Extra-cons-itutional bodies like that which 3ir. Roebuck has undertaken to direct only rise to power and influence when there is need for them, but it is a great mistake to suppose that they are more likely to be needed under an aristocratic than a popular Government. On this point the hon. gentleman has a theory which we think will he modifxed on a calm appeal to the knowledge with which his copious political study has made him familiar. He apologizes for the agitation he promotes as a temporary necessity which will pass away with the success of the Administrative Reformers in reducing "lhttle petty creatures" of noblemen to their due insignificance. "Associations of this sort," he says, "only arise out of the faulty institutions-of the country;" the fault lying in the predominance of aristocratic inflaence. " We onght not to he met in Liverpcol for this purpose. We ard doing tho actual business of the people whom we elect for seven years. I want to get at some constant, effective instrnment to work out the purposes which we are now endeavouring to do in this extraordinary and, if I may use the term, spamodio effort." In other words, 'he pressure of voluntary political organizations on the Government will disappear when the composition of the Government is popularied. We do not know where recorded facts are to be found in support of this calculation. They certainly are not in the history of France, at a time when the very name of aristocracy was proscribed; nor need they be sought in the present political condition of the United States, where conventions, caucus meetings, masi meetings, and every other variety of a *tation arecultivated to an extent of which this country has happily only an intermittent and caral experience. It rather seems to be shown by observation, as by reason, that the more popular the form of government the more susceptible are the men who compose it of violent and emphatic demonstrations of popilaropinion, and that these will generally be forthcoming in a direct ratio to the chance which circumstances aford of their being exerted with success. Mr. Roebuck appears to think that when his task is done it will only remain for him to lay down the insignia of his ofice and resign the guidance of the State to the magistrates who, in ordinary times, are found to be snfiicient. We rather think he would bequeath his dictatorial power to
fa dozen presidents of half a dzen nenw reform associations, all of them more bent upon mischief than we can suppose him capable of becoming.-Mc knchcster Guar-

Western Australia.
TVESTRRR AUSTRALIA.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Having superintended the convict service in Western Australia from its commencement, I ain anxious to supply some more correct information than appears yet to be general respecting certain points connected with that colony.
The expenditure on convicts, including transport, during the first five years was 400,0001., and the number sent having been nearly 4,000, the average has been about 1001. per man, or 201. a-year.
The yearly cost of the rations, supervision, and clothing of the convicts in Western Australia only differs from the same expenditure in English prisons by the difference in the market value of the necessary supplies, the same scale of allowances, rations, &c. (and in some cases a lesser scale than in English prisons), having been there adopted.
It should, however, be borne in mind that the convict service in a penal colony bears expenses which in England are distributed among different departments-among the county-rates and the poor-rates.
It is, moreover, unfair to divide the first cost of prisons, gaols, depots, police, &a., by the number of convicts sent to any colony in the frst few years, and to say that this is the cost of sending convicts to the colony; the mora so that the price of provisions in a small settlement must be much enhanced on the first introduction of a large body of people -in the case of Western Austraha further increased by the high prices caused by the discovery of gold in the eastern colonies.
Your correspondent, Mr. Eddy, is mistaken in callRg Western Australia a "torrid climate." The principally settled portion of the colony extends from 30 deg. to 35deg. south latitude, and in the southern districts a fire is not disagreeable to many persons at aU seasons of the year. The heat in the northern districts during the four summer months ranges high, until the sea breeze sets in about mid. day; for the remaining eight months the climate is temperate, and certainly no more torrid than it is Arctic.
For all practical purposes connected with a system of transportation Western Australia offer a field which m
be souaght elsewhere in vain. There is plenty of ic - tural land and an excellent climate; all kinds of corn grow luxuriantly; all sorts of vegetables flourish in the much abused sand. The vine and the olive grow there exuberantly; its timber, of which there is a vast supply, is of the most valuable description, as it is never attacked either by the teredo naveats or the white ant; and there is every prospect that the mineral resources of the colony may be developed to a considerable extent,
Wester Australis is separated from the other Australian colonies by an impassable desert, and the communication by sea is far more unfrequent and more expeneive than from England either to Melbourne or Sydney, for from its geographical position the trade of Western Australia will be always, as it hitherto has been, more with India, Singapore China, and England than with the other Austrayan colonies.
A considerable number of convicts has already been sent to Western Australia, and as a rule they have done remark. ably 'well. The colonists have always been and are still anxious to co-operate with the home Government in any well-regulated system of transportation- and, judging from past success in that colony under many unfavourable cir. cumstances, there appears every reason to hope that transportation may be carried on to Western Australia for many years with benefit to the colony, to the mother country, and to the convicts.
The presence of a free population, which exists and will increase in Western Australia, is indispensable to the success of a penal colony; a purely penal colony would be Norfolk Iiland on a large scale.
I trust you rnay consider these remarks not unworthy of notice in your valuable journaL Tiley may appear somewhat desultory, but I feel it due to the colony where I have
nsolongemployed andin the welfare of wlichI feeladeep interet, to xake publc these facts at a time when so muc& anxious attention is giien to the question of the best field for the reception of convicts.
I am, Sir, your verv obedient servant.

Directions bave been received at Chatham by Captain Allan, in charge of the stores which were brought home from Kertch by the Turkish Engineer Corps, and deposited esn the gun-wharf, to deliver the entire stores, with the texception of the large pontoons, to the Rtoyal Engineers, with the view of their being placed in the storel belonging to that corps. Sinca the articles have been landed at Chatham they have been under tho sole charge of Captain Allan, and seen have been employed daily in examining and cleaning the various stores, to prevent any serious effects resulting from their exposure to the weather. Iammediately on the arrival of the order atChatham for the removal of the stores to the Royal Engineers' Barracks preparations were made for their delivery to the officers appointed to receive them, and they are now in course of being renmoved to the south gunshed at Brompton Barracks, where they are to be deposited. On opening the casks and boxes in which the harness, tools, and other articles were deposited in the summer, it was found that they had not suffered in any degree from the effects of their long exposure in their partially unprotected state, care having been taken to oil and cleanse from damp every article separately betore it was deposited in the place assigned to it. The pontoons will remain on the gunwharf, owing to there being no place large enough to receive them.
The Dake of Cambridge having consented that a number of the invalid soldiers at the Military Hospital, Chatham, should be sent to Bath for the purpose of undergoing a course oi medical treatment in that city, arrangements have been made for stationing invalid troops in that 3neighbourhood. A party of invalids selected from the 32d, 37th, 45th, 61st, S3d, and 84th Regiments, left Chatham yesterday for Bath in, char,ee of Assistant-Surgeon Cyrus Daniell and a wardmaster of the Medical Staff Corps. As soon as they have sufficiently recovered they will return to Chatham, when another party of invalids wiU be forwarded to that city.
The foUowing officers have joined their respective regimaents at Chatham, for the purpose of taking the command of their depots at the Provisional Battalion-viz. :-Captain J. V. IL Montagu, 10th Regiment, and Captain F. Rhodes, 27th Enniski'dens.
The following notice was issued yesterday by the Lords CommisSioners of the Admiralty:-
" The Board of Admiralty, in consideration of the meritorious services frequently rendered by lieutenants embloyed s Admiralty agents on board contract steamvessels, have determined to award an annual promotion to the rank of commander on the reserved half-pay if any lieutenant should be recommended by the officer conducting the packet service at Southampton on the ground of general or special good service."
The Star, 8, Commander A. Boyle (1855), was paid off at Chatham yesterday afternoon, after being in commission Tour years, during which time she has been twice to the south-east coast of America and the ralkland lQands and back, besides being stationed for a considerable period in the Rio de la Plata, where she did duty as the senior officer's ship. During the time she has been in commission the crew have been very healthy, and but few deaths occurred on board. Two men were accidentally drowned and one of the crew was killed by falling from aloft. The Star will be placed in ordinary at Cbatham, and, as -he is a -very old sbip, it is not expected that she wiU be again comnmissioned.
The Resolute, Arctic vessel, has been entirely stripped at Chatham, and her rigging removed. She is moored off the dockyard, in charge of the warrant officers, and as soon as a place has been assigned her she will be attached to the fleet of vessels Iying in ordinary.
The Poictiers, 74, at Chatham, has been towed down to the dockyard for the purpose of being taken into No. 4 dlock, where the shipwrights will this day commence break. iag her up. This vessel was guardship of the ordinary a, Chatbam for several years, but is now too old for further service.
Mr. Cornelius T. A. Noddall has been appointed master to the Victory, flagship at Portsmouth.
The Salamander, 6, paddlewheel steamsloop, Commander George T. Mecham, now in the fitting-basin at Sheerness, for repairs, will not be ready for sea until the 1st of Mlarch next. Most of her defects are topside damages, received from stress of weather while in search of the missing ships which belonged to Dundee.
An Admiralty order has arrived at Sheerness to receive the Pembroke, 60-gun screw steamship (for Coastguard service at Leith), for the purpose of her being examined, she having been on sbore on her passage round from Devonport to Leith. A court-martial is ordered on board the flagship Waterloo, 120, Captain Lord Frederick Kerr, to try Captain John Fraser, and the officer of the watch at the time the ship took the ground.

To The Editor Of The Times.
TO T17B EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I hope, for the sake of his clients, that :Mr. F. SoUly Flood, 1, Pump-court, Temple, is in thehabit of displaying a little more legal acumen
nder the mnspiration of his wig and gown than he has showvn in his letter to Tlhe Timnes of to-day.
I assure M3r. Flood that I had no more intention of oflending him when I gave his name as counsel for the prosecution than I had of offending Mdr. O'Brien when I gave his name as counsel for the defence. I was called upon to give names, and I gave them. Mr. Flood does not deny that he prosecuted; and I said nothing more. hIow on earth has he w orked himself up into the
elief that I intended to injure him I I confess myself at a loss to understand his letter. He teems to think that I impute to him a back-wardness in coming to the rescue of the late Mr. Temple's memory. Nothing of the kind. I did not require Mr. Flood's assistance. I was perfectly convinced of my friend's innocence, and had I wauted aid I should hardly have sought it from tb e counsel for the prosecution. Then, Mlr. Flood alleges that I have been occupied for four years in investigating this case. I never said anything of the kind, nor is it the fact. He says that the publication of his name was meant to give weight to my assertion of Mr. Temple's innocence "asthatof aperson whohad eitherinvestigated, believed it, and could prove it," or had failed in his duty. Really, Sir, I had no idea that the mere mention of Mr. Flood's name could import aU this; or that I should find in that gentleman's patronymic another Lord Burleigh s shak-e of the head.
I trust Mr. Flood wil endeavour to calm his spirit and soothe his wounded feelings; and I would suggest that some of his friends, before he next addresses you, should just hint to him that his proposal to test Mr. Temple's innocence by producing the brief for the prosecution is not a very candid way of doing business. As to my want of courtesy, I can assure Mr. Flood that I never intended anything of the kind, and that I deeply regret having been even the innocent cause of wound;ng his feelings.
I am, Sir. vour obedient geyfwdn+

LEGAL ACCIDENT.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Mr. Brady having impugned my veracity, I beg to n,form him that my authority for stating that one of the chiloleen of the late Mr. T-was withdrawn from3 the election te the schools at the desire of Cardinal Wiseman was the aieber of the late Mr. T-; and it was to the energetic ca=vass of this lady that the eldest child was mainly indebted for-'hr election to the Warehonsemen's and Clerks' Schools.
If 4he Cardinal's name was used without authority the advisers of Mrs. T- are alone responsible.
I fdIt it my duty to make the precise circumstances of this case puLblic, but at the same time l deeply sympathize with tihose who are the victims of legal accidents; and, as unworthy motives have been attributed to me, I may mention that my vote and interest assisted in securing the admission of the eldest child to the schools, where she will receive a good education and every comfort for six years.

Meeting Of Ticket-Of-Leave Men.
MEETING OF TIOKBT-OF-LEAVE MEN.
A meeting of ticket-of-leave men, very similar in its chsaracter to the one held early last year at the National Hall, Holborn, took place last evening at Farringdon-hall, Snowbill. The proceedings derived peculiar interest from their bearing on the recent discussicns relative to our whole system of secondary punishments, which have been pro. voked by the alarmning increase of crime and outrage in this country. It was thought by the promoters of the meeting that, at a time when almost everybody is crying out for stronger measures of repression, it might not be undesirabla to call together the ticket-of-leave men of the metropolis, i-
order to hear from their oy a lips what they have to say for themselves in answer to the apprehensions which they arerightly or wrongly-exciting in the public mind, as well as to receive their account of the difficulties they encounter in their endeavours to obtain an honest livelihood. The arrangements for this singular gathering were made by Mr. Henry Mayhew, at the request of the Earl of Carnarvon, who was announced to preside, and who was anxious that on the eve of the reassembling of Parliament, where this subject is likely to be fully canvassed, our legislators should have the benefit of whatever light such a meeting might afford, before approaching so important a discussion.
The muster on the occasion comprised from 70 to S0 Of the class specially invited, who were admitted on present. ing their respective tickets of leave at the door; and in order to allay any distrust which might pervent them from responding to the summons the police were rigorousl6
excluded as well from the entrance and immediate vicinity of the hall, as from its interior. Most of the men present bore the appearance of belonging either to the costermongering fraternity, or to the class of bone-gatherers and pickers. up of other unconsidered trifles. Greasy caps and still greasier jackets were the prevailing attire; but here and there was to be seen one of more pretentious equipment than his bretbren, the highest style of all being that of the man whose bushy moustache and flashy appoint' ments-including the glossiest broadcloth, unimpeachable linen, heavy gold chain, gold studs, and dazzling ringstogether with his jaunty air and his languid puff at the halfextinct cigar, all betokened an unmistakeable connexion with the swell-mobsmen of London. The majority seemed under 30 years of age, and had nothing sinister in their expression of countenance. If there was indeed among them now and then one whose sunken cheek, abashed eye, sharply-protruding lips, and "forehead villanous low" pointed him out as a customer whom the belated wayfarer would not be anxious to meet in a lonely thoroughfare on a dark night, it is but fair to say that such a person was a rare exception to the general run of his companions. The proceedings were advertised to begin at half-past 7 o'clock, but a delay of three-quarters of an hour occurred, during which a few stragglers dropped in, swelling the entire assemblage to perhaps between 80 or 90.
Lord Carnarvon took the chair, and on or near the platform were Mr. H. Mayhew, the Rev. Mr. Portal, Mr Beach, Mr. Wyld, Dr. Mackay, and some dozen or la other gentlemen more or less interested in the reformation of our criminal population.
The PRESIDENT, in introducing the business, said that the men were, no doubt, rather surprised that he should have called them together, and he was quite aware that in asking them to meet him he was taking an unusual course; but he trusted that their conduct that evening would nob make him repent his having placed confidence in them, and offered them an opportunity, when the public were disposed to judge rather harshly of them, of saying something in their own behalf. His only motive was to see as much sympathy and kindness extended to them as was compatible wvith the claims of their other fellow-subjects. He solicited from them information both as to the difficulties they experienced in finding employment on their discharge from prison, and as to their condition generally. Most of them ad within the last five or six years offended against the laws, and been sentenced to different periods of transportation. Circumstances which it was unnecessary to detail had rendered it impossible to carry ou1t that sentence, and accordingly, after undergoing one-half of their original term in penal servitude, they had been discharged with a ticket of leave-th *t was to say, on the understanding that they were all thoroughly sorry for what they had previously done, and were determined for the future to lead honest and industrious lives. Many of them, no donbt, sincerely desired to carry out that laudable purpose, but, unhappily, on the other hand, many others had fallen away from their good resolutions and yielded to temptation; while, perhaps, some had even wilfully and deliberately broken their engagement. At this the community naturally felt angry, regarding it as an abuse of its confidence - and it was, perhaps, inclined to deal severely with them if it was shown that the fault was clearly and entirely theirs. They were sensible and intelligent men, and would therefore at once perceive the necessity of abstaining on that occasion from any allusion to the justice or injustice of their sentences, or to the hardships endured in prisons or in penal hulks. Their interests eould alone he served by strictly confinng their remarks to the real question before them-namely, what it was that had prevented many of them, as a class, from redeeming their promises of amendment; and also whether their tickets of leave had been of any use to them, and had stood them in any stead in their Eearch for employment. The chairman concluded by inviting any of the men who had a statement to make to do so.
The first person to ascend the platform was a tidilydressed and simple-looking bald old man of about 60, who prefaced his recital with the words, " Fellow men and brother sufferers," and went on to describe himself as one who had " seen more trouble in his timethan any other mau this day in England." Being the same individual who told his tale of distress at the former meeting in the National Hall, mi the character of a dock labourer who had the most precarious employment, and was constantly harassed by the police in his endeavours to support himself by hones. industry, it is not necessary here to repeat the greater part of his statement. The only addition to his former narrative was that in April last he obtained a situation upon Mr. Mayhew's recommendation, and he thanked God that he had been able to keep it ever since. He had to work very hard for his living, but he knew many like himself who would be onlv too glad to change positions with him, and to return to honest pursuits. Many now ran about the streets laUirg their old games who would jump at the chance of emigrating to Australia; and he was very sorry for the day that he had himself ever come home from the colonies. Notwithstanding all that the newspapers might say, he knew for a fact that one-half of the robbes ies and garottings were not done by ticket-of-leave men, but by militiamen and the regular soldiers. (Applause.) He saw a case last week at the east end of the town where a person was garotted; and who was it done by? Why, by a mniitiaman - and a policeman stood by and saw it, and very likely he got his "reglars" out of it. ("RHear, hear," and laughter.) ile saw a watch stolen at Broadwall, and two policemen fighting which should have the case mad which the inside of it; and, although the landlord of a publichouse there gave the policemen in charge for the robbery, of course the poor ticket-of-leave men At first got the blame of it. fHe was certain that " the best part on his class" would be glad to get employment if the police and thepublic wo ud only let them. When the men were released there was no institution to receive them, so they went back the first nght, as he himself did, to their old associates, aud spent all their money, after which they were obliged to return to their "old racketting." (Applause.)
Mr. MAYHEW then produced a certificate of character for the first speaker, signed by a director of a Phosphate Manure Company, in whose factory he is employed. This document described the man as one of the most industrious and best-conducted servants of the establishment.
A fat, burly-looking young man, in a rough over-jacket and a wide-awake hat, next claimed to be heard, and began by demanding somewhat bluntly, "Who is Mr. Mayhew ?" Having had that gentleman pointed out to him, he set himself very rudely to catechizing him, but was soon compelled to desist by the feeling of the assemblage. He then remarked that he meant no offence, but he wished to caution the men against making themselves so public, and risking their lives to come there for the sole benefit of another man. That man was Mr. Mayhew. (Hisses.) They might hiss him if they liked, but Mr. Mayhew convened these meetings, and said upon the cards that he iatended to m ake them and their difficulties known. [A Voice. -" You take it in a wrong light."] Perhaps he did, but he was a poor man, and could not express himself like Mr. Mayhew. He wished, however, to speak the truth, and not to relate merefictions. Lord Carnarvon ought to know that Mr. Mayhew called these meetings, where he extracted information from the men privately, and then published it in his work. (Confusion.) That gentleman stated the other day in a Sunday newspaper that while a ticket-of-leave man could make his 5t. a-week and keep a pony by his old practices, it was useless to expect him to become a clerk ugon a salary of 15s. a-week. A nice man was Mr. Mayhew. (aughter and hisses.) It was nonsense to talk of shutting out the police while such a man was-
The CAIRMEAN at this point cut short the speaker's vehement invective, which appeared to be fast reaching its climax, and appealed to the good sense and good feeling *-f the meeting to support him in confining the discussion to its legitimate scope. Shouts of applause followed this remonstrance, and tho indignant orator was compelled to sit
The third speaker was the shrewd little costermonger who figured at the first gathering held last year, and whose story was then reported in ertcnso. He said that, for his part, so far from attacking Mr. Mayhew, he was glad to see that there was somebody still left to befriend his class now that it had so many enemies, and was regaTded by the public and the uress as so many wild beasts that it was necessary to chain up or destroy before they coald be rendered harmless. It was said that it was better that hundreds of ticketof-leave holders should meet the fate of Marley than that one Mr. Cope should be murdered; but those who said so ought to know that, after all, his clases were not all burglars and garotters. (Hear, hear.) He got a living himself as a costermonger because he conld not find better emselo3 ment, and he should certainly be glad to catch at 15s. a-week, because he had a wife, one child, and an aged maother to keep. He had no other prospect befnee him than the workhouse for his old age, and he was anxious to scrape a 'littge money together against a rainy day, but fie had no wih to get it by robbery or outrage. He believed that the feelingofwbany otherswas thesamne. Eehadhadhisdiicaltiec to contend w'ith, bht they were not so great as those that beset many others, for he was getting an honest living, thank God ; aaa, though he got only one meal on Eome days, that wasfaBr prefeLable to three mealsand a pannikin of soup
inte Penitentiary. (Applaulse.) A man disch4rged with a ticket of leave was a, branded felon, and his ticket was
ot a bit of good to bi, unless, ineed, he was one of the
lealked ones a sid llawi got frendB an4 thenl he might be,
aUSeto get a sitnation. But that was not his case: he was one of the ignorant ones, who since he was14 haA had to rough it, baving been left without fatheror mother. [A. very favourablo testimonial to the character of this sieker vwas also produced at the close of his remarks. rt wa% signed by certain respectable inha'sitants of the parhes of St. John and St. Margaret, Westuiister.]
Speaker No. 4 was a respectably-dressed, frank-looking young man, apparently not more than 20, who stated that two years ago he got a ticket of leave, and after some trouble at last obtained employment. He had been taught in prison to make bricks, but at first that advantage was no good to him. He had a father and three brothers to keep, and he tried to earn a livelihood by making a few articles for sale. He once worked for a builder, but soon lost his situation because it got wind that he had a ticket of leave. He was happy to say that his father was now employed under him and three other men besides. (Applause.) It was a mistake to suppose that every ticket.o.leave man must be wliolly destitute of right principle. These tickets were no more good to the men than a previous conviction was to a prisoner at the Old Bailey; they only threw him back. The better plan was to throw them into the fire, and then try toget on by your own exertions.
MIr. WYLD, the employer of the last speaker, bore testimony to his strenuous endeavours to obtain an honest livelhood. He had had a suspicion for some time that the lad had a ticket of leave, but he had carefully concealed it, being determined to give him every encouragement in recovering a good character. (Cheers.)
Speaker No. 5 wass a short, thin-faced, and middle-aged man, who was discharged from Portsmouth 13 years ago, and was afterwards turned away from his first situation because it was discovered that he had been a convicted thief. Now, however, he got his living by selling fish about the streets, and was enabled to support a wife and five children.
This speaker's employer, Mlr. I. G. Watts, fish salesman of Billingsgate, then declared that he never knew till that moment that this man had been in prison. His conducthad for years been irreproachable, and he was altogether a pattern to many who worked in the market.
Speaker No. 6, a mason by trade, of from 40 to 50, and exceedingly well dressed, but with a bitter and irascible expresson of countenance, next ascended the platform, and suveighed fiercely against the persecution he had undergone at the hands of the police in his quest of honest employment. How, he asked, could ticket-of-leave men, without a character, expect to get work when thousands of artisaus in London who had never seen the inside of a gaol were now starving for want of employment? There ought to be some institution to receive -ufortunates like himself when they came out of those hotbeds of demoralization, our pubhc prisons. He had tried for tho last 12 months to get employment, but he could not succeed; and starve he was determined that he never should. (Applause.) He was willing to work for 3s a-day to-morrow if anybody would engage him, and that sum was as little as he could well live upon. The way in which his kind friends " lent him a hand" was to set the police to hunt him down without cause. His married sister had her house lately broken into, and when the police went to inquire about it his niece told them, " Oh! I have an uncle who is a housebreaker." (Laughter.) By this means the police were set upon him ; he had been dragged about by them from one court to another upon every variety of false oharge. Once he was accused of stealing the hat he had on, and it was only by the hatter's coming forward to prove his purchase of it that he was ultimately liberated. He was a ticket-ofleave man himself, and he now lived with a ticket-ofleave woman; and of course that was sufficient to justify his apprehension for every conceivable depredation committed in his neighbourhood. If a mat was stolen from the next door to his, ten to one but the poHce would oc down upon him for it. After denouncing the inconsistent benevolence of the country, which lavished its care upon the foreigner and the nearo, and neglected the oppressed and the destitute at home, the speaker concluded by entreating for himself and his class a chance of returning to the paths of honest industry, and by declaring his conviction that transportation would never stop crime.
Mr. MAYnEw said that if the last speaker really wished for employment he should be happy to furnish him with the name of a gentleman who would give it to him. (&pplausse.)
Two or three other ticket-of-leave men having addressed the meeting in a similar strain,
The C xsmum made a few appropriate remarks, winding up the proceedings. Having asked for a show of hands to ascertain whether the men would prefer to have a ticketof-leave in England or a ticket-of-leave in the colonies, and found that they all, without a single exception, signified their choice of the latter alternative, the noble lord thanked the men for their very orderly behaviour, and said th%t he had listened to their statements with great interest, and should ponder them over in his mind at his leisure He encouraged those who were most inclined to despondency to make one determined struggle more to regain the path of virtue, observing that it was not one, two, or even tLre
faults which should cut them off from the sympathy of ths public, but only the practice of habitual and persevering crime.There were many wealthy persons disposed to assist them if they showed themselves worthy of it, and he therefore earnestly implored them to abandon their old associates when they were released from prison, to keep together aU the money to which they were then entitled, and to emigrate with it to the colonies, where they had the brightest prospects before them. (Applause.)
Before dispersing there was a general call for "Peter," the moat prominent actor, it may ba recollected, at the National Elall meeting in 1856, and who would seem to be a great favourite among his con.freres; hut this somewhat iM-timed summons was not responded to, and the men therefore quietly left the building without hearing so approved a spokesman.
