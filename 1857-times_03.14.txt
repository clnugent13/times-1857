TO TEH EDITOR OF THB TMES.
Sir, -In your paper of yesterday I read "that yotu are authorized by Lord Panmure to state that the assertion made by Commissary-General Filder, in a pamphlet recently published by him, that Colonel TuLoch, when sent out to teb Crimea, carried with him a commxmsion to supersede Mr. Filder as Commissary-General of the army, is without foundation." I never made the assertion here imputed to me. What I did say was, that " when Colonel Tulloch left this country as one of the two Commissioners for the Ease, he had been named to succeed me as Commissary-General
with the rank of Major-General, on my being displaced and the Commissariat remodelled."
When you are authorized to deny that Colonel Tulloch had been named by the Secretary for War, in a despatch addressed to Lord Raglan, to succeed me as CommissaryGeneral with the rank of Major-General on my being displaced, I may address you again. I would have written yesterday, but was prevented doing so by my iedical attendant.

House Of Lords, Friday, March 13.
PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGENOf.
HOUSE OF LORDS, >DAY, MARcH 13.
THE TUTRN7R RTQRP
Lord ST. LEONARD'S said that he had already given notice, without fixing a day for the purpose, of his intention to call attention to the bequest of the late Mr. Turner, and hLe now gave notice that he should bring forward the question on Thursday next.
THE FREEDOM OF REPORTS. I Lord CAMPBELL begged to state that on account of the approaching dissolution of Parliament he should not proceed further during the present session with the committee to inquire how far the privilege now given to reports of the preceedings of courts of law might be extended to the reports of the proceedings of Parliament and other public assemblies; but he begged to give notice that immediately on Parliament reassembling he should move the reappointment of the select committee. On considering the subject he could not at all think that their lordships would agree that a rule should be laid down of complete immunity for the publication of everything spoken at every public meeting. He believed such a rule would be inconsistent with public safety and destructive of private character; but, at the same time, he was still of opinion that the grievance of which journalists complained might to] a certain degree be remedied; for there were certain public meetings the proceedings of which he thought might be placed on nearly the same footing as the proceedings of courts of law, and it was possible that some definition might be made of the public meetings with respect to which the same privilege of reporting might le extended as applied to courts of lawv. At present, the mischief which might be expected to arise from the present state of the Law was greatly mitigated by the circumstance that if juries only gave nominal damages no costs followed. Formerly, until recent times, if an jaction for libel was brought and damages to the amount of one farthing were recovered full costs followed, and thus a multiplicity of pettifogging actions for the recovery of costs -was encouraged ; but, at present, unless substantialdamages were given no costs folowed, and the temptation, therefore, to bring actions was taken away. Nevertheless, an action bronght against a respectable journal caused great
anxiety, and threw on the defendant his own costs. It wasI possible that some expedient might be found whereby, if no real injury had been sustained, the costs of bringing the action should fall on the party bringing it, and if it should be the opinion of the jury that no real damage had been sustained they might find a verdict for the defendant; or if nominaldamagesonlywere given, then, with the approbation of the court, not only no costs should be recovered, but the plaintiff should pay the co3ts of the defendant. These were matters for the consideration of the select committee, when Parliament reassembled. The noble and learned lord also gave notice that, with the view of expediting and generally improving the proceedings of select committees of their lordships' House, he should at a future time move a standing order to the effect that the oath to witnesses should be administered not necessarily at the bar of the House, but, when deemed fit, before the select committees. At present the greatest inconvenience resulted from its being necessary that witnesses should be sworn at the bar of the House. Judicial business was sometimes interrupted in consequence of a crowrd of witnesses being collected at the bar, and the expedient was occasionally resorted to of hearing witnesses nnswors before select committees, and swearing them afterwards, if it were thought necessary.
Lord MONTEAGLE; was glad the noble and learned lord had caUed attention to the mode in which 'witnesses before select committees were sworn. He had been informed that an alteration of the practice could not take place by a mere standing order of the House. It was absolutely necessary, in order that false witnesses before select committees might be punished for perjury, that the oath should be administered either under the authority of the statute made for the purpose, or according to the invariable usage and precedent of the House. (Hear, hear.) In consequence of the inconvenience resulting from the present mode of swearing witnesses, a practice had obtained, which was open to much objection, of sometimes hearing before a select comnittee witnesses who had not been sworn at the bar of the House, and ca'ling them on a subsequent day to the bar, and swearing them to the whole of their evndence, written out from the shorthand writer's notes. He also thought it desirable that the committees should have power to send for persons, papers, and records as in the Commons, without obtaining the previous order of the House.
Lord CAMPBELL believed that rtheir lordships had it in their power to alter the mode of administering the oath.
The LORD CHANCELLOR did not see his way quite so clearly as his noble and learned friend to the assumption that their lordships could delegate to other persons the power of administering an oath. It might be matter for consideration whether an act of Parliament would not be necessary. As at present advised, he should feel a difficulty in drawing an indictment against a person who had taken a false oath before a select committee of their lordships' House, exercising a delegated power to administer oaths.
ITHE APPEAL TO THE COUNTRY.
The Earl of DERBY said that he intended on the second reading of the Income-tax Bill to advert to the circum. stances under which the present appeal was about to be made to the country. He found that the second reading of the Bill was fixed for IMonday, and he wished to ask the noble earl (Albemarle), who had a motion on the paper for that day (upon India), whether he would oblige him by postponing it, as the Income-tax BiU must otherwise come on after -he noble earl's motion. It would be a great convenience to their lordships, as well as to himself, if the noble earl would, under these circumstances, postpone his motion until some future day.
The Earl of ALBEMARLE would postpone his motion until Friday next. (A cry, "Till the next Parliament.") No, no! (A laugh.)
TheLighting of Towns (Ireland) Act Amendment Bill went through committee.
The Commissioners of Supply (Scotland) Act, 185G, Amendment Bill was read a second time.
COST OF THE WAR WITH PERSIA.
The Marquis of CLANRICARDE, in rising to move for correspondence relative to the cost of the war with Persia, said that, as Parliament was on the eve of a dissolution, it would not be proper to invite their lordships to discuss this question at any great length. It appeared, however, from all the documentb that had been laid before Parliament that the finances of India were in a most unsatisfactory state. It was intended by the Government that half the expenses of the late war should be charged upon the revenues of England. This intention was communicated to the Board of Directors, who expressed their entire satisfaction with the proposition. But they appeared to have overlooked the ways and means by which provision for such expenditure was to be made, nor did they state in their reply what portion of the resources of India wereavaUlable for the war, or how they proposed to raise the funds. He thought it must be admitted to be improvident to charge a proportion of the expenses of the Persian war upon the Indian revenue without seeing how to provide for those expenses. The normal state of Indian finances in time of peace seemed to be a state of deficiency. The deficiency had now gone on for four years, and it had been recommended by an ex-Governor-General that there should be a continual deficiency every year for public works. The deficiency, it was to be observed, which amounted to 2,000,0001. annually, was not, however, caused by any expenditure upon railways. The debt had increased more than 7,000,0001., and the recent financial operations of the Indian Government had resulted in complete failure. A loan of 2,000,0001. at 44 per cent. had been closed and the money of the subscribers returned because the amount of subscriptions was comparatively trifling. A new loan at 5 per cent. was opened, bat, according to the correspondent of llte Times, whose authority was unimpeachable, a very small amount had been paid into the treasury, and the loan was being taken up very slowly. No one would wonder at it when they knew that money could be invested in railway shares with 5 per cent. inezest guaranteed by the same Government, and the chKu or larger profit if the speculations were founded on sense and reason. He had not said a word about the Persian war, because that had nothing to do with the question of the capabillty of the finances on which a portion of the cost was to be charged. He believed that to put Indian finances in proper order the Government must resort to proper economy. (Hear.) The noble marquis af ter expressing a hope that an estimate of the cost of the war would be appended, concluded by moving for copies of correspondence that might have taken place between the Court of Directors and the Board of Control, or between the Board of Control and the Treasury, respecting the proportion of the cost of the war with Persia to be charged upon the Indian revenue, or relating to the ways and means by which provision for such expenditure was to be made in India.
The Earl of MALMESBURY said,-In the present state Df pubhlic affairs it appears to me of great importance that we should at least know somnething about this Persian war. Up to the present time it has been a sort of myth-a mystery-with respect to which Her Majesty's Government have refused all information. We know nothing of the original quarrel. We know nothing of the negotiations which must have followed that quarrel, because I assume that Hler Majesty's Government did all they could to prevent collision. We know nothing of the answers of the Persian Government to the appeals of Her Majesty's Government. We know nothing of the orders given to tho troops, or of the preparations to carry on the war when war was declared in so very unsatisfactory and irregular a manner. (Hear, hear.) We know something, it is true, of the operations at Bushire,
but after that we know nothing except, from the public papers, that negotiations have been carried on in Paris by Her Majesty's ambassador and the Persian envoy. We do not know whether the latter had authority to carry on negotiations, but we are told a satisfactory treaty has been tarried out between him and Lord Cowley. The noble viscount at the head of the Government is accustomed to treat things and men very coolly, and certainly he makes no exception in favour of Parliament. If he has not entire conadence in ono House he gives himself that confi-
dence by saying its opinion is opposed to the opinion of the country. If t a other House appears not to be in a satisfactory state with respect to his own Administration he dissolves it. It may be that he acts within the four corners of the constitution, but I am not so certain that the noble viscount is within the four corners of the constitution when we consider the manner in which he has begun, continued, and ended this Persian war, without any explanation whatever to Parliament, and without putting on your lord-hips' table a single paper in relation to those affairs. First of all, it was acknowledged that this war was going on. We were promised an account of the negotiations which preceded it; of the cause of the war, and of the position of the Government with respect to Persia. We had a victory at Bushire. The Persian ambas8ador appeared at Paris, and my noble friend said it was not a convenient or proper opportunity to produce the papers. I never could understand, nor do E understand now, why we could not have had an account of the cause of the war and the means which Her Majesty's Government took to prevent it. I do not see why we could not have had those papers, whether the war was going on or was concluded by treaty. WVhat chance is there of our having any history of this war? In a few days Parliament will be dissolved. A new Parliament wil not assemble for two months. The treaty of peace will not be ratified for four or five months. It will be a stale story, and we shaH be as ignorant of the events, and more ignorant than,% c are of the war of the Roses. The noble viscount has carried on a private war with Persia, and this country has had no notice of it whatever. (Hear.) In 1852, when the Government of my noble friend went out of office, Herat was in the possession of the Persian forces. We did al we could to persuade the Persian Government to withdraw, but to this hour I do not know when they retired or why they did so, or what means our Minister used to persuade them. There has been some alusion to a treaty, but it has never been laid before us, and now at the eleventh hour, having been at war seven or eight months, very important negotiations having been carred on, a treaty of peace having been concluded at Paris, we are still without any information from Her Majestys Government. (Hear, hear.) Candidates. for seats in the other HEouse will be compelled to appear before the electors, and if asked about the Persian war, its causes and its consequences, will be unable to give any explanation at all upon the subiect. It is only this morning that for the first time an apparently official statement has been laid before the country. I perceive that my noble friend (Lord Clarendon) expresses his dissent, but I am unaware of any previous information which has been afforded us. An important journal has this morning published a detailed account not only of the treaty which has been signed at Paris, but also of one which ought to have been signed at Constantinople but for some fancies on the part of our ambassador at that capital. I would ask my noble friend whether he does not think, under the circumstances of the country, it would not be quite proper and decent to give at least a sketch of the treaty which we are told has been concluded? I know that technically that treaty cannot be laid before Parliament until it has been ratified; but I would submit that it would not be proper to allow this Parliament to be dissolved without receiving some information upon this very important subject.
The Duke of ARGYLL, in reply to the question put by the noble marquis (Clanricarde), said, he was not aware of any objection to the production of the papers referred to by the noble marquis.
The Earl of CLARENDON.-I cannot regret that my noble friend opposite has put this quesrion to me, for I can assure your lordships that it has been to us a matter of deep regret that a sense of public duty should have compelled Her Majesty's Government to withhold that information with respect to the Persian war to which Parliament and the country are justly entitled. Nothing but a sense of public duty has prevented us from laying before Parliament those papers upon thesubject which had been prepared before the session commenced. My noble friend, however, is not quite correct when he says that no information has been given as to the causes of the war. I felt it to be so necessary to give such information that on the very first night of the session, in replying to a speech of my noble friend op. posite, I adverted to some causes of quarrel which had arisen between the Persian Government and Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran. I said it was quite impossible to make that quarrel a cause of war, and, although Mr. Murray had been compelled to leave Teheran, yet we did not proceed to hostilities upon that account. We thought that time and reflection would bring the Persian Government to better views-that they would perceive that it was their interest to remain on good terms with this eountry, and we did not doubt when the peace with Russia was made known in Persia the Government of that country would seek to resume amicable relations with us. It was only when the Persian Government showed a determination to attack and possess themselves of Herat that we thought it necessary, notwithstanding we had no diplomatic relation with that Government, to make a direct communication upon that subjeet, vvarning the Persian Government of the consequences of their proceeding and requesting them to desist from carrying out their intention. In order that there might be no doubt of the views of Her Majes4y's Government and of the notice given to the Persian Government, I, on the first night of the session, took the liberty of reading at length a letter addressed by me to the Sadr Arzam, upon the subject of the siege of Herat. Thus, it cannot properly be said that your lordships are in entire ignorance of what were the causes of the war, for, if the whole of the papers had been before this House, those causes could not have been more distinctly stated, nor could the warning given to the Persian Government of the course which Her Majesty's Govern. ment would feel it incumbent upon them to pursue have been more plainly stated. The answer which I received to that letter from the Sadr Azam entirely blinked the subject of Herat, but stated that an ambassador was about to proceed to Paris upon a complimentary mission, and that he would be instructed to enter into communications with our ambassador at Constantinople. Although we had no reason to believe that such communication would lead to any satisfactory conclusion, yet the British ambassador at Constantinople was instructed to receive any communication which FerrTh Khan might make respeoting not only any offer of reparation forthc insultaniuaryinflicted upon our Miister atTeheran but also upon the subject of more pressing importance-the siege of Herat. I can assure my noble frend that the rapture of those negotiations arose from no fault upon the part of Her Majesty's ambassador at Constantinople. We made known to our ambassador at that capital the terms upon which alone we thought an honourable and satisfactory arrangement could be made, and we directed him to make known those terms to Ferakh Khan. The Persian ambassador said he would not be justified in assenting to those terms without first referring them to his Government. That was not unnatural; and he then asked whether we would wait until he could receive a reply from his Court, and whether, in the meantime, we would send out orders to India to suspend all hostile operations ? We replied that it was Impossible to suspend the execution of orders which had been sent out long before. Herat then fell, a declaration of war by the Indian Government followed, and the Persian ambassador then declared, before receiving any answer from Teheran, that all negotia. tions were atan end. Shortly after his arrival in Paris, war being declared and the negotiations being at an end, Ferukh Ehan solicited an interview with Lord Cowley, stating that he had full powers to negotiate a peace, and had received an answer to the communication he hed addressed to his Government. We had every wish to concltude peace * we had no desire to humiliate Persia; we had no personal objects to gain. We therefore desired Lord Cowley to listen to any proposals which Fernikh Khan might make. When negotiations had been commenced at Paris we thought it would be most mischievous, if not fatal, to lay papers before Parliament, a discussion apon whieh might prevent a settlement, or at least might complicate the negotiations. That was the only reason why the papers have not been presented to this and to the other House. When my noble friend says that we are still in ignorance as to whether the Persian ambassador had full powers to treat, he surely must have forgotten an answer I gave a few nights ago to two questions put to me by himself. The noble earl (Malmesbury) asked me, first, whether it was true that a treaty of peace with Persia had been concluded, and, next, whether the Persian ambassador had full powers to negotiate such a treaty ? I said that, before commencing negotiations, we had examined the powers of Ferukh Khan, and found that they were ample. A treaty has now been concluded, and will, I hope, be ratified in a shorter space of time than the noole earl seems to think will elapse, but in the meantime I have no hesitation in informing the House what are exactly the terms which have been agreed uqon. They are theee,that all Persian troops and authorites shall withdraw from Herat and every part of Affgbanistan within three months of the conclusion of the treaty; that the Shah renounces all claim of sovereign ty over Elerat and Affghanistan that he will abstain from all interference in their internal. .affain.$
and recognizes the independence of both Herat and Affghanistan. In the event of any difriculties arising btween
Persia and Herat or Affghanistan the Perian Goveen iS to have recourse to the good offices of England before resorting to acts of war, and England on her part engaes to use her best efforts to effect a settlement of any such differences in a manner honourable and satisfactory to Persia. The Shah also engages that if it shall be necessary for him to repel aggression from Affghanistan, he wfill not make anyuse of the hostilities in whicn be may engage for that purpose for any other object, and that as soon as ho attains his object, and immediate satisfaction has been given, he win withdrawr within his own frontier. Again, the treaty of commerce we had with Persia was by no means so satisfactory as the treaties made by Russia and France with Persiaaud it is now stipulated that all our commercial rolations and our arrangements in reference to consular aDpointments shall be placed on the footing of the most favoured nations. It is also stipulated that Mr. Murray, on his return to Teheran, shall be received with certain ceremonies rhich have been agreed to by the negotiators. There is likewise another stipulation in this treaty which I think will go far to put an end to that fraitful source of difference which has so long existednot only in Persia, but throughout
the East-I mean the system of giving protection to the' native subjects of a foreign State. (Hear, hear.) That, /I say, has been a constant source of quarrel and dispute, pot only in Persia, but throughout the East. I took the lberty, with reference to our future relations with Turkey, tq bring that question before the Congress in Paris. It was well received there by the representatives of the different Powers, and they all undertook to review the present system and endeavour to place it on a better footing. We havo introduced a similar clauso into our treaty with Persia, and we engage no longer to protect the subjects of the State, except
those in the immediate service of the embassy or the consulate. (Hiear, hear.) I hope and believe that other foreign Powers will engage to do the same thine * but, at any rate, England in that as in other matters wall nowr be placed on

tion of this kind, which will do more than anything else to remove this cause of difference. (Hear, hear.) We have likewise entered into a stipulation on the subject of tho stave traden very considerable slave trade is carried on in the Persian Gulf - our present treaty with Persia on that subject ends in l8id, Aan we have engaged that it shall, be prolonged for 10 years more frOm the date at which it would expire, as matters would otherwise have stood. It is also stipulated that hostilities are to cease immediately on the exchange of ratifications, and that our troops are to be withdrawn from Persia immediately that the Persian troops are withdrawn from Herat. Feruk Khan has sent letters to the Persian commander near Bushire, to inform himi of the negotiations and of the treaty, and to invite him to talke part in the propsed armistice, and similar instructions have Deen forwarded to General Outram. A general amnesty is to be published in favour of all peraons who may have taken art with or in any wa
assisted our troops in Persia. I blieve, my lords, I have not omitted to state anything that is of importance in the treaty; and I tbink you wil agree that by that treaty we shal obtain all that it is important for us to obtain, which is the withdrawal of the Persian troops from Herat and an engagement to respect the independence of Herat and Affghanistan, as far as possible, with the view to prevent quarrels between Persia and those States, and, as far as Essible, to maintai a neutral territory between Persia and
dia. I thnk you will also agree that there is nothing in the treaty contrary to the interests or the honour of Persa ; and if it is faithfully carried out, as I am sure it will be, in the spirit in which it has been negotiated I think we may look forward to a great improvement in our relations with Persia. (Cheers.)
The Earl of MALMESBURY asked if the treaty contained any stipulation as to coaling-stations in the Persian Gulf ?
The Earl of CLARENDON said, the Government had not sought to obtain any stipulation onx that point.
The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH.-My lords, as it was of great importance that we should have had bef ore us ample information onwhich to inform our judgment with respect to this transaction, it is matter for common regret that it has not been possible to place these papers before your lordships' House. At the same time it would be uncandid in me and would show a want of fairness if I did not admit that, looking to the proclamation of the Government of India, and asunming that the facts stated there are correct, I think the Government of India were perfectly justifiable in resorting to hostile operations. (Hear, hear.) I will say more than that. If there had been no treaty in existence, it would have been the bounden duty of the Government of India to resort to hostile operations to prevent the occupation of Herat in the name of Persia. (Hear, hear.) I say that, because it is as much the interest of the Government of India to maintain Herat in the hands of some independent State as it has been considered the intercst of the Western Powers to maintain the Bosphorus in the hands of an independent State. (Hear, hear.) It is essential to the safety of India that that gate to India-that passage through which alcone on the side of Porsia hostile operations can be directed against her-shall be in hands in which she can place confidence. But it would be uncandid in me if I daid not state at once that I do not think our quarrel has really been with Persia. The real question has been, not with Persia as an independent Power but with Russia, under whose dictation Persia has acted. (Hear hear.) I say that those operations against Herat have been beLn, continued, and completed, not during the war with Rnssia-although during that war the design of those operations must have been matured for the purpose of effecting a diversion-butafter the conclusion of the peace with Russia- and I think the treatyrecently concluded with Persia is the complement to that which was concluded a year ago with Rusa. I take it as a satisfactory admission on the part of Russia that for the present at least she will abstain from approaching the frontier of India, and that she defers her desgns against that country. (Hear hear.) I think it is a satifactory admission on her part t at she has reconidered her postion, that she thinks her interests demand at the present moment that there shall be a good understanding between her nd England in Europe, and that shefeelathatagood understandingnever can exist while sho carries on operations in Asa the object of which must be a hostile approach to the frontiers of India. (Hear.) With respect to the lieutenant said to have been sent to Cabul, it is not on information like that on which I ground my opinion of the polcy of Russia in Asia. I ground my opinion on her patent acts in advancing to Khiva'and to other points on the road to India-an advance totally inconsistent with common sense, unless it was done with the ultimate object of approaching the Indian frontier. I conceive that no State, swayed by any. thing like reason in its councls, would do what Russia has done unless she had that ultimate object in view. I wi
not at this time, or at any time, in this House discuss the probabilities of success on the part of Russia in any such ambitious design against our power in India. But this I wiU say, that I should consider we exposed ourselves to the most imminent danger if we were at any time to regard the advanca of an army directed by Russian officers towards the frontiers of India in the light of an absolute impossibility. (Hear, hear.) My lords, I cannot believe that tobe impossible which has so often been accomulished since the time of Alexander. (Cheers.) t will fay this also, that unless we take care to place in India the ablest man we have in the direction of our military power-if we imagine we can send any one out to that country to ceommand an army, a man who knows nothing whatever of military operations, a respectable gentleman, it may be, in a civil office, a respetable member of Parliament, but not a soldier-if we imagine that we can so far carry our party habits as to indulge in an appointment of that desenption, I say my lords, there s danger; for you may depend upon it that it is only by great ability that the Russian troops wil be directed in the event of their making any hostile approach to the frontiers of India. (Cheers.) Mly lords, we hear a great deal about the construction of canals and railways in India, and about the necessity for legislation founded on that of the civilized countries of the West, But, depend upon it, it is not upon any civil improve. nments that the ultimate security Of that coulntry depends.
Orempire in India has been founded by the sword, and by the sword it must be maintained. It is only by a disciplined army-an army well equipped and well commanded-that that empire can be secured. And, mylords, I confess when I look back to the events of the Last few months I doregard with dismay the prospect before us, if princples similar to those which have ben recently acted upon are continuaUy to form the basis of our administration. We have had two war We have now a war with China- we have had a war with Persia; and both are owing to bad appointments. (Hear.) No one can doubt that it is Sir John Bowrin
who is the author of the war with China. I will not say with the same absolute certainty that the incompetence of Mr. Murray for the important situation for which he wa3 selected is the cause of the Persian war, but I will say that it must very materiaUy have contributed to that war. I can recollect a state of things very different. I can look back to the influence exerted by Sir John Mal. colm and Sir John Macdonald upon that country. Then, too, everything is in our favour at the Court of Teheran. It is our mterest to maintain Persia as a strong Power; we should desire above all means to preserve her honour and secure her independence. (Hear hear.) There is not a Persian but must feel satisfied that we are the natural
friends of his nation, ad looking at the conduct and at the conq.ucsts of Russia and at the manner in which her inluene is established at Teheran, can we doubt that Russa is the natnral enemy of Persia I (Hear.) I say, then, that any man of ordinary ability, suited to the management of affiirs in the East, hoiuld avail himself of these natural advantages, and ought to be able to obtain for his country a decided inluence in the councils of Persia. I trust that in future that will be the case. I do not dispute the ability of Mr. Murray; I believe he is a very talented man; but I must observe that the kind of ability which has great influence upon society in England may be utterly useless in the administration of affairs in the East. The talent required to manage Orientals is altogether peculiar. ll influence in the EaSt is personal, The inl'uence exerted by Sir John Malcolm and Sir John Macdonald was a personal one. Many a man distinguishes himself greatly in the East, obtaims great influence, effects great changes, and carries out measures of the greatest possible benefit, who, when he returns to England, is useless here because his talents are of a character unsuited to his own country. And so it is with men of great ability, ability well establshed and recognized here, who, however, fail utterly when sent out to the East, where the habits and customs of the people are new to them, and where, in fact, the whole constraction of the human mind is different. Depend upon it that if this country is to secure the influence which it ought to poss at Teheran such influence will only be acquired byamanwhohas shown Is abili ty to deal with Orientals, who is thoroughlySc,. quainted with the people, and who has the tact to manage
em.(Hear.)hy lords, under different circumstances I
should have een desirous of entering further into this question; but, at all events, I did not think I should have been dealing fairly by the House if, upon the first reular occasion on which this subject has come befora us, Ihad hesitated at once to declare my conviction that the war has been a just one; that if there had been no treaty it would have been equally politic and necessary, and that in reality we have been contending, not with Persia, but with Russia, (Hear, hear.)
The Earl of CAIRENDON.-I cannot allow the attack which the noble earl has just made upon Mr. Murray to pass quite without notice, and I think, upon reflection, ho himself will regret that he has made such an attack. The noble earl has said in effect that the war was caused by Mr. Murray's unfitness, and he grounds his charge of unfitnees on the assumption that that gentleman has had no experience of Orientals. Mow, it was exactly on account of Mr. Murray's acquaintance with Orientals and of his skll in dealing with them that he was appointed as Minister to Persia, and for no other reason whatever. He had been for upwards of aLX years in India, had obtained very great influence there, had given entire satisfaction to the Government under whom he had served, was an excel-
lent Arabic scholar, and within three months of his arrival at Teheran was able to converse and conduct his own interviews with tho Shah. I venture to say that altoether there is not a single person who has a better claim to his appoint. ment, and on the very grounds which the noble earl has stated should guide the Government in their selection for Eastern appointments.
The Earl of ALBEMARLE entertained no apprehension of Russian aggression in India, but did not think it neces. sary to enter lnto that subject at the present moment, be. cause he hoped in the next Parliament to have an opportunit of stating the reasons why he differed from the noble earl opposite inr espect to it. He did not, however, like the present occasion to pass without calling attention for a few moments to the financial condition of India. If he thought it probable he should find the distinguished mobleman who had lately been Governor-General of India in his placo in
the House he should defer his observations; but, as this did not seem likely, he wished to be allowed to state now, 'akig as he did a lively interest in all that relatedto India' how much he deplored the financial blundering of the late
Governor-General. (& laugh.) In a minute which had been laid before both Houses of Parliament it was stated that the Harqus of Dalhoside had increased the Indian finances from 26,000,0001. to 30 000 0001. NoW, onlookdngto thestate of the net revenue of nd& at the period to which he called attention (1854-5) hefound that the revenuewas 20, 366,OOO1.; con Ifn tlYrif d Dalhousie's views were correct, there must ye been in liens and charges upon revenue no les a sum out of this 30,000,0001. than 9,633,4207. In another part of this minute the noble Mearquis stated that he had added 4,3 If,0001. twerling to the revenue by territorial acqi stions. If this were correct they would naturally expect that it would show itself in the net revenue of the country, but it had all vanished into thin air. The net revenue in 1851-2 was 21,764,6151; inx 1854-5, as he had alre adv stated, it was 20,36, 5801. ; so that, instead off its being 4,330,00031. more, it was i,387 93X1 less than it was before these annexations, In 182- the revenue was 22,343,9207., so that the deficiency, as compared with 1854-5, was no less than 1,976,3401 tin other words, we were nearly 2,000,0001. the worse off, instead of 4,330,0001. the better for the annexations. So much for the financial results of the " Beggarmy-neighbour " policy advocated and founded by the late Governor-General One word now on the subject of Indian credit. It was little more than two years since the late Governor-General declared that he had converted a 5 into a 4 per cent, debt. Shortlyafterwardsa new loan at 41, per cent. was negotiated, and, as he was informed, there were most extraordinary solicitations to obtain subscriptions. That loan, however, turned out a miserable failure. What he wished to point out to their lordships was that when the 41 per cent. loan was announced the stock of the 4 per cent. loan fell to a discount, so that while the Indian Government netted between 300,0001. and 400,0001., the proprietors of the 4er cent. stock, who were principally absentees or administrators of trust property, received 15s. 9d. for every pound which theyhad advanced on the security of the honour of tne Indian Government. Eventualy a loan at 5 per cent. was originated, but it was doubtful now if money could be procured even upon those terms. Such was the state of the 3inances of India, and he, as one interested in the welfare of that country, felt that it was necessary that the financial polcy of the late Governor-General should be made known, in order that his successors might be warned against falling into similar errors,
The motion was then agreed to.
The followig Bills were read a first time :-The Incometax Bill, the Indemnity BiU, the Extra-Parochial Places Bll, and the Copyholds Enclosure Bill.
Their lordships adjourned at 25 minutes to 7 o'clock,

The South Devon Railway Bil was read a third time and passed.
PETITIONS.
Petitions were presented by Mr. BKmAxto,;r, from the shipowners of the port of Blyth, for the establishment of a harbour of refuge at Newbig in Bay; by Mr. Bxsns, from the Cork IMedical Protection Association, praying for suerannuation for medical men attached to Poor Law unnons; and by Mr. H. A. BnuCx, from the inhabitants of Truro, for the entire abolition of church-rates.
SOUTHAMPTON ELECTION.
The SPEAKER announced that he had received from the petitoners against the return of 31r. Weguelin for Southampton notice that it was not their intention to pro. secute their petition.
INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS BILL
Sir W. HEATHCOTE, for Sir S. NoRTHcoTm, said that it was impossible to pass this Bill during the present session, and he therefore moved that the order for the further progress of the Bill should be discharged.
Agreed to.
THE LUNDHILL COLLIERY ACCIDENT.
Mr. CAYLEY askled the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he was able to furnish more informa. tion respecting the late catastrophe at the coliery near Barnsley than had yet been given to the public
Sir G. GREY.-I am sorryto say that I cannot furnish any further information than the publiEc are in possession of with regard to the very melancholy and lamentable accident at the Lundhil Colliery, and for this reason-that, as my hon. friend Imows, the pit has been closed with the advice of persons of the greatest authority and experience in these matters, as the best means of extinguishing the fire in the pit, and as, in fact, the only course which could under the circumstances be adopted untl it was safe to reopen tho pit to examine it. It is, I fear, impossible to obtain any further information at present. All that I have done is to take care that there shall be the fullest investigaton into the cause of the accident, and I have no doubt that every possible means will be taken to aculre such information as may tend to prevent such accidents m future.
ECCLESIASTICAL AiND CAPITULAR ESTATES
BILL.
Mr. M'GREGOR asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he had any objection to lay this Bil upon the table?
Sir G. GREY.-A Bill bas been prepared foLnded on the report of the committee that sat last year to make inquiries respecting the operation of the Ecclesiastical Commission. It includes all those recommendations of the committee which require legislative sanction. Some of these recommendations may be adopted by the Ecclesiastical Commis. sioners without the authority of an Act of Parliament. I have referred the Bill to the EeclesiastLcal Commissioners. I understand that they desire to introduce some additional provlsions, but I have not yet received the Bill back from them. I therefore think that it would not be desirable to lay the Bill on the table this session.
THE FOUNDLING HOSPITAL.
Viscount RAYNHAM asked the Attorney-General whe. ther the attention of the Charity Commissioners had been directed to the complcated state of the finances of the Foundlng Hospital, and to the effects of the existence of that institution.
The ATTORNEY-GENERAL replied that the Charity Commissioners had instituted an inquiry into the state of this foundation, including both its financial condition and its management, and he believed that their report would shortly be presented.
TE SERVICES OF OFFICERS IN THE CRIMEA.
Mr. W. EWART asked the Under-Secretary for War when the return, ordered on the 26th of June, 1856, respecting the duration of service of officers in the Crimea, would be lid before the House.
Mr. F. PEEL replied that the return was not quite completed, but it would be laid upon the table before the end of the sesion.
BREVET LIEUTENANT-COLOJNLS IN THE ARMY. Major KNOX asked the hon. gentleman the Under Secretary for War whether a major, having been promoted to the rank of brevet lieutenant-colonel for service in the field, is entitled (having afterwards succeeded to the command of his reginient) to reckon his service as brevet ieutenant-colonel towards his promotion to the rank of colonel, although he was not in command of his regi. ment during that time.
Mr. F. PEEL said that an officer who had served four or five years with the brevet rank of lientenant-colonel, and was then appointed to the command of a regiment, would not be required to complete a service of more than six years before he was made a full colonel.
CIVIL SERVICE SUPERANNUATION.
Mr. WILLCOX asked the right hon. gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether, having expressed in the House his hopes that the reporb of the Royal Coin misaoner upon the Civil Servce Superannuation Act would be laid upon the tablo before Easter, ho had intimated to them his oxpecttions upon that wl int; and, if not, whether he will do so, remindmg them; at tho same time, that they have had this question in charge ever since October, 1856.
The CHACELLOR of the EXCHEQIJER said that it would be impossibie for him to give these commissioners any instructions as to the time at which they should make their report; but he understood that it would be ready before E,aster. The commissioners had, in accordance with the recommendation of the select committee of last session, called for a report from eminent actuaries upon this subject.
DANISH TRANSIT DUES.
Mr. G. DUNDAS asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether with reference to the statement made by him that four.fifdjs of the Danish Transit Dues were to be abolished he had considered the expediency, before any treaty vas
ned, of stipulating for the abolition of the remaining
Tho CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER.-The ques tion of the transit dues has been very carefully negotiated by our Minster at Copenhagen, and by the Ministers of other Powers who are interested in the remission of these dues; and I understand that the settlement embodied in the treaty about to be signed has given satisfaction, not only to our Minster, but also to the agents of the Hlanse Towns and of other Powers more directly interested in the transit. I have every reason to believe that the stipulations contained in the treaty are reasonable and equitable ones.
hir. DUDAS.-Is the treaty signed?
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUERL-It may be signed now, but it was not at the time our last advices left Copenhagen.
THE WORJKHOUSE OF ST. GEORGE'S, HANOVER.
SQUARE.
Viscount RAYNHAM inquired of the right hon. gentleman the President of the Poor Law Board whetber casual
r are admitted on application into the workhouso of a George's,Hanover-squaro; and, if so, for what puruoe
h of that workhouse, sta ina that on and after the 7tl of July, 1856, the tramp wards of that house will be closed,
Mr. BOUVERIE said that he had made inquiry, and had found that the notice referred to in the question of his noble friend had been affixed to the door of the workhouse. He was also informed that such casual poor as were brought there by the police, or as the master of the workhouse deemed to be actuaUly destitute, were received; but that what were called regular tramps were not admitted into the workhouse. As might have been expected, no tramps had since the affixing of this notice applied for admission.
THE SITE OF SMTHFIELD MARKET.
Lord R. GROSVENOR rose to ask the right hon, gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether he was able to give an assurance thatthe influence oftheGovernmentwould be used to prevent the approp iation of the vacant site of Smithfield-market to any other purmse than that of the enjoyment and recreation of the publc.
Tho CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER, replied that sinco he last addressed the House upon this subject a letter had been received from the City Remembrancer, stating that the Markets and Improvements Committee of the Co ration of London had had this subject under their consiTeration for some time past, and he expected in the course of next wreek to b able to commniucato with the Goyorn-
mnent. Therefore, they might hope speedily to be put into possession of the views of the city upon this matter.
TaE TREATY WTIH PERSIA.
Sir A. CAMPBELL rose to call the attention of the noble lord at the head of the Government to that clause of the treaty concluded with Persia by which it was; alleged that England was to abandon her right to protect Persian subjects- He dared say that benefits might arise from this stipulatiourwhich wouldcounterbalance its disadvanta,hbut he understood that the only way in which we oould obtain information from Persian subjects without compromising them with their own Government was to extend to them our protection. This country would be placed in a disadvantageous position if she made this concession, and other Powera did not do the same- It was rumoured that the Minister sent ever to arrange the present difficulty, Feruk Khan, was himself, through a near relative, under the protection of Russia. Whether that was true or not, thero could be
doubt that many Persian subjects were under the Russilan Drotectorate, and likely therefore to act in the interest of
ussia. He wished to know whether the noble lord, in framing this treaty,had taken care that whatever was aban. doned hy Englana' should be equalUy abandoned by other countries. To put himself in order the hon. member concluded by moving that the HIouse at its rising adjourn till MIonday.
Lord pALMERSTON.-I must object to the hon. gentleman's motion, because I think it would be convenient for the despatch of business that the House sbould meet at 1 o'clock to-morrow, and sit for a short timo to pass some biUs. With regard to the question that he has started, perhaps he will allow me to say that it would be very inconvenient that hon. members should discuss in this House a treaty of which they are not in posses. sion, and more especiaUy a treaty which, although already concluded, has not yet been ratified by the contracting parties. Discussions of the supposed objects of such a treaty are calculated to have an injurious bearing on the conduct of those by whom it is negotiated. Therefore I will not foUow the hon. member's example by stating anything with regard to this particular treaty. With respect, however, to the point to wihich his observations were directed, I may say thst great inconvenience bas arisen, and is likely to arise, from the practice prevalent in Persia, under which foreign missions are entitled by prescription to exercise a protection over Persian subjects not employed in their service. (Hear, hear.) For the permanence of friendly relations with the Government of Persia I think it is most desirable that that practice should be discontinued. (Roar.) At the same time, I agree with the hon. gentleman that it would not be becoming in one country to abstain from a practice that wovld continue to be pursued by other Governments. The abnegation should be general; and I can assure the hon. member that Her Majesty's Government will be happy to renounce all protection in Persia over persons not actuaUy employed in the service of our missions and our consulates, provided Russia and other Powors are ready to do the same. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. LAYARD was very glad to hoar what had fallen from the noble lord, who had laid down a very just doctrine. (Hear, hear.) The rale of granting British protection to persons who were not our subjects, and who used to be constantly getting us into trouble, had happily been withdrawn in the case of Turkey; and he rejoiced to find that the same right, which had been grossly abused, was to be relinquished in Persia. Individuals having no connexion whatever with this country, and some of whom were actually members of the Royal family, often claimed British protection, and led our embassy into infinite dificulty and disgrace. Another important quesion, to wvhich, however, he was afraid he should receive no answer, was this, whether the terms which had been granted to us by the Persian Minister at Paris were not previously offered at Constantinople, and whether, in fact, the Persian ambas. sador at the latter place had not been willing to give us even better terms than those granted at Paris. He (Mr. Layard) believed that such really had been the case. The negotiations took place at Constantinople before active steps had been taken, and before it was known that our expedition had reached the Persian Gulf; and if the terms were then rejected which had lately been accepted the whole of the bloodshed that had ensuod had been utterly in vam. The attack on Bushire would materially weaken our influence where it had hitherto been predominant. The tribes who used to be our warm friends had lost many men in that attack; and their chiefs, who never forgot such injuries, were consequently nowconvertedintoour blood enemies, This subject ought to have been discussed in that House long ago, because it affected the position of this country, and all other nations in Central Asia, Before England entered into a treaty binding her to certain gnarantees in reference to Central Asia, they ought to have an opportunity of expressing an opinion ypon those guaranv tees. It might be inconvenient, pending the negotiation of this treaty, to debate its specifio terms but the question of policy as to our relations with Central Asia ought to have been discussed upon general grounds.
Lord PA LBERSTON was understood to say that it would be found that the treaty concluded at Paris was better than any likely to have been obtained at Constantinople. The negotlations at Constantinople were not broken off by the Bntish Miniter, bat by the representative of the Persian Government.
EVENATS IN CHINA.
Sir H. WILLOUGHBY inquired whether the Govern. ment had received intelligence of any further disturbances in Cina.
Mr. LABOUCHERE.-The last accounts which have reached us represent Canton and the other Chinese ports to be in a state of complete tranquillity. (Hear, hoar.)
ELECTION PETITIONS.
Mr. VANCE wished to caU attention to a matter affecting the character of the House, as Uwe as tho honour and tho security of individuals. After the last general election a large mass of petitions were presented, which, if their allegations were true, gave ground for the belief that the constituencies were greatly demoralized by bribery and corruption. Many of these petitions went off upon aome technical ground, butthe majoritymeta different fate. Agents from the two great political parties having conferred together, and agreed to pair off county petitions against borough petitions, a great number were thus got rid of, and many disappeared altogether. This practice was, howvever, improved upon in regard to Ireland, because not long aftor Parliament met every gentleman who had contested a borough or a county in that country, and had obtained a seat on that (the Opposition) side of the House, had a petition presented against him. (A laugh.) Thesepetitions could all be traced to the same laboratory. There was evidence to prove that they were the work of a man who had held a high posihonin thatHouse-namely, the late fr. John Sadleir, whoseprivatesolicitor, andthe solicitor of the Countv Joint-StockBiinl were the dramatis pcrsonc in the proc
ing. Those two individuals used to exchange theirparts, each acting as agent for the petitioners in one case and as surety for them in another. The result, as he had said, was that every member on that side who had contested anIrish borough or county was petitioned against. This naturally produced a little retaliation, and petitions were also presented againt nearly every gentleman who had contested a seat on thOother side. There was a meeting of the agents to arrange matters, when, and with two or three exceptions, the petitions were all amicably paired off, and not one agaist s eutlemen on his side of the House was proceeded with. s reason for bringing this subject forward was that they had no security against the same thing being repeated at the ensuing elections. It was most scandalous that every successful candidato for an Irish county or borough should indiscriminately be petitioned against; and he was, therefore, anxious to mow whether Her Majcsty's Government intended to propose any sessional order at the beginning of the nex session with a view to putting a stop o this system. Could they not either attach some penalty to the act of pairing off petitions, or obtain some secority for their being proceeded with when presented?9 A remedy might be provided by rendering conduct such as he had described a misdemeanour at statute lawv.
The motion for adjournment till lMonday wras then w ithdrawvn.
MR. fiPEAXEB'S RETIREME:NT.
The House having gone into Committee for the purpose of considering Her Majesty's gracious nmessage in answver to the address £rom the Commons relativeto the rtirement of the Speaker,
Eord PAIMI2ElSTON said,-I rise to proposo to the House a resolution for the purpose of giving effect to the gracious message sent by Her Mfajesty to this House in reply to the address praying that Heor Majesty would be pleased to con. fer some mark of signal favour upon the present Speaker. Her Majesty's reply was that it would require the con-
currence of Parliament to enable Her Majesty fully to carry out the wishes of this House. I therefore propose a resolution that the sum of 4,0001. a-year (hear, hear) be granted to Her Majesty out of the Consolidated Fund, for the purpose of enabling Her Majesty to settle an annuity on the Right Hon. Charles Shaw lefevre, the samo to commence from the day on which ho ceases to fill the Chair of this HIouse, and to continue during the term of his natural life. (Cheers.)
The resolution was agreed to nemile dWi.entiintc.
SUPPLY.
THE CHELSEA BOARD OF GENERAL OFFICERS.
On the report of the resolutions agreed to in Committee of Supply on Thursday evening,
Mr. C. P. VILLIERS said,-I was not in my place last nighit when the gallant member for Huntinedon referred to the proceedings of the Chelse Board, but find that he is reported to have said that I was the person who imputed a political bias to the general officers who sat on that board in the conduct of their proceedings, and in the decision at which they arrived. I wish to state distinctly that I never made any such charge; in fact, what I said was exactly the reverse. The Only Occasion On which I had to refer to the politics of the general officers was in defending myself here agaist exactly the same charge mLaoi against me elsewhere, and I then said that I did not believe that they had been influenced by any political bias, and that I had not collected anything from what they said during the whole of the proceedings which could give me the least idea as to what their politics were. I believe that the gallant member for Huntingdon did not impuLto that to me, and I only regret that upon that occasion, stating wihat 1 had heard, I should have said that they wecre all on the Conservative side. I regret that I wvas in error in that re spect, and that that error has ben~ made use of for the
purpose of charging them with political bias. Although my statement was made seven or eight months ago, I never heard any complaint on the subject until two or three weeks ago, when the gallant member for Hsuntingdon informed ma for the first time that three of those general officers thought themselves aggrieved by that reference, and I understand that Sir Alexander Woodford, General Knollys, and Gene, ral Bell have all declared themselves not to be of the Conaervative side. (A laugh.) I regret very much that I should have imputed that to them, thougheI am very glad to bear that it is not the case. (" Hear, 'and a hugh.)
ARMY MEDICAL REFORM.
Mr. STAFFORD said he wished to repeat the question which he had put to the Under-Secretary for Warlast night on the subject of the Medical Devartment, not that le had any hope of receiving a favourable answer, for if the hon. gentleman had had any reform to announce he would not havo been sllent on it last night. He would, however, enter his earnest and mourrful protest against sending out troops for active service in China without some steps being taken to insure them against a recurrence of the terribli calamities which had happened in our military hospitals at the commencement of the last war. When thoso troore disembarked in China another general hospital would be opened on those shores, which would be conducted on the samne principles-or rather with the same want of principle, and would be exposed to the same confusion of departments and the saime clehin! of authorities which had made Scutari what it was. His complaint was that the promises made by the Government, and more particularly by the noble lord at the head of the Government; two year ago, that the Army Medlical Department should be thoroughlyrefor0ned, had been set at nought. As a maere mnatter of eoonory and apart from Philanthropic motives, every care Ought to be taken of the lives of our soldiers, and every mheasur adopted which experierce showed to be necessary to mnake the Medical Depatmen completely efficient. He should be glad to hear fro. thle Government th&t they wore prepared to redeem the promisos which they had made when they went into office, and if hie had the honour of a seat in the next PaLrliament he should bring the whole subject before it.
tr. PEEL sid the question nowl put te him by the hon. gentleman was not exactly A repetitioa of that which he asked last niglst. The qestion asked by the lion, meber last night was whether te Governmet had taken ot
templated taking any skePs to carry into effect the r dE tioes agreed to by a commnttee Of last sessione with ferene to the state of the Army Medical Department. Since jast evening he (Mir. Peel) had read thos r tesolutions, and le found that the more important recommendations contained in them were, that there should be an increase in the scale of
ay of medical officers, and that additional facilities should Eaafforded for their retirement uLpon half-pay. He are
with those resolutions, He would not deny that the aadvan. tages offered in other deparhments of the service had the effect f preventing the most able medical men from cf . peting for employment in the Army Medieal Department and he was anxious that the medical ofiners of %he army should possess at least equal advantag -es it t enjor by the same clas of omcers in other departments. lie hon. gentlemai was aware that the amount which the Gos vernment coutld expend upon the army was restricted anto it was necessary to nmake a seection aulong the vaio1 improvements that were suggested. Those imhprovements whch were regairded as of the greact cpordnbee were first carried inLto effect, andi others whichi, though important, were of lessspl neoessit y were Postponed. This was the reason whyethe imPrOvements to which the resoluations referred had not been carried into effect. The hon, gentle. man hadexpressed hisconfidence thathherewas no rosyst
of anything being done bycthe Governmoent. He(t TSctil did not know on what grounds the hon. gentlempanrcoue

the Governmnent to deal with this question in a manner which would b satisfactory to the nmedical officers and bone. ficial to the service. The ion, gentleman had indulged in viery glomy predictions with regard to the sanitary state of the troops who were about proceehain to China. The climate of that country was undoubt i unfavourable tce

Sir W.

He (Sir W. Williams) invited the kone gentleman, and any other mem. bers of that House, to vit those hospitals.

Friday Evenin.
The funds have shown increased dulness today
and have closed at a decline of an eighth. Cousols for money were first quoted 93i to J, but in the afternoon, owing to heaviness in the appearance of the foreign exchanges, they receded to 93i to J. For the 8th of April the last transactions were at 93i to J. The rate for loans on Government securities iS still 6 per cent. India Stock left off at 221 to 223; India Bonds, So. discount to par; Exchequerbonda, 98i to J; and Exchequer-bills, par to 3s. premium.
loreign securities opened with firmness, but there was Iess activity towards the close. Turkish Six per Cents. for the account were negotiated at 97k, ", and3E. In Mexican the transactions took place at 22k and 23k for money, and 23k and J for the ac. count. The general business comprised-New Granada Active, 227; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 78, '78k, i, and 78; Russian Four-andn-Half per Cents., 988 and 97 ; Spanish Three per Cents., for the account, 41 and 41j; and the New Deferred, 25.
In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the ratem for Hamuburg and Amsterdamn were a shade lower. With regard to other places there was no important alteration.
The corn-market this morning was dull at former rates.
The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a steady business without change in prices.
The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 70f. 65c. for money and 70f. 90c. for the account, thowing a further decline of an eighth.
.lhe monthly statement of the Bank of France, piblished to-day, is as favourable as had been anticipated. The stock of bullion shows an increase of 1,085,0001., and the total now stands at 8,890,0001. The position of the establishment has also been strengthened by a further diminution of 600,0001. in its note and of 520,0001. in its deposit liabilities. The discounts, wlich last month presented a decrease of 1,450,0001., again figure for a decrease of 1,125,0001., caused by a contraction of mercantile business, which has rendered the supply out of doors adequate for the general wants. The advances on stock-s and shares, which had previously been reduced to a comparatively insignificant amount, show a further curtailment of 126,0001. The balance to the credit of the Government has increased 900,0001. Judging from the sum of 16,4301. paid for premiums, the gold purchases of the month must have reached about 1,500,0001. It must not, however, be inferred that but for these purchases the stock of specie would have shown a loss, instead of a gain, since, if the market had been left to its natural course, the amount would bave flowed in without much delay. The artificial purchases slightly accelerated its arrival, but in every other respect the charge incurrred for premiums has been an entirely useless loss.
The letters from Paris describe a tendency to reaction from the late increase of speculation on the ]3ourse. The prospects of the Russian Railway scheme are considered bad, and no one is willing to purchase shares in anticipation.
The Wooloomooloo, from Sydney, has arrived in the Downs after a favourable passage of 83 days. She has brought 2,304 ounces of gold and 1,000 sovereigns, mal;ing a total of 10,2161. The Dunbar was to leave on the 24th of December, and the Niroroud on the 1st of January. The commercial advices on this occasion reach to the 19th of December, and describe stagnation in business, owing to the immoderate arrivals of goods from England. Some failures had been announced, but not of a serious character. The harvest was expected to p rove abundant. The details of the census of New South Wales taken on the 1st of March had been published. They show the population to have been 269,722, of whom 150,488 were males and 119,234 females. The disparity between the sexes is therefore disappearing. Twenty years back the proportion of females to males was only 2 to 5; now it is 4 to 5.
The colonial produce-markets during the week have been inactive, and there has been a partial decline in some of the principal articles. Sugar does not present any material alteration; prices have occasionally been a shade lower, but to-day native Madras went off with more spirit at a recovery of rod. compared with quotations current at the commencement. Considerable inquiry also existed for arrival. Nothing has been done in floating cargoes of foreign. Coloury descriptions of coffee have hardly maintained their late high value, a few parcels of the new crop of plantation Ceylon having beendisposed of on termsbelow those ruling privately. No transactions are reported in native growth. T wo floating cargoes of St. Domingo have been disposed of for near continental ports at a further advance. For rice the market has been steady, although rather quiet as regardswhite kinds, for which the export inquiry appears to have partly subsided. Saltpetre is very dull, but prices, which are still much above the average of former years, remain unaltered. The tea-market has been without animation. Common congou is not much inquired after, and the closing quotation is nominally Is. 1id. per pound. The public sales, which commenced yesterday, terminated to-day without establishing any change.
The report of the Ottoman Bank has been issued, preparatory to the meeting on the 26th. The profits from the commencement to the 31st of December have amounted to 31,4791., and a distribution of 15s. per share (being equal to 10 per cent. per annum) is recommended, which will leave a balance of 12,7291. to be carried forward. It is atated that the introduction of a legitimate system of banking into Turkey has been fully appreciated, that branches have been established at Smyrna, Beyrout, and Galatz, and that a profitable extension of business may necessitate the payment of the remaining instalment on the shares.
The report of the Bank of Egypt, preparatory to their meeting on the 24th, states that business was commenced at Alexandria on the 7th of July last, and that froni that date to the 31st of December a profit wvas realized of 5,9411. The paid-up capital was 125,0001. at the beginning, and was increased to 187j,5001. on the 31st of October. It is proposed not to divide the profits until the expiration of twelve months froum the date of opening.
At a meeting of theVan Diemen's Land Company, held to-day, Mr. J. Cattley presiding, the report and accounts were unanimously adopted. It was stated that the revenue has slightly increased, and that the annual rental is now about 3,0001. The proprietors will, however, have to look principally to the sales of land for dividends, and the agents will arrange these as opportunities may be presented. Some expense has been incurred through a lawsuit for the recovery of forfeited shares, the directors having been defeated by a techaical objection. The accounts, made up to the 31st of December last, show a balance of 2,9861. Annexed is an abstract of the report
"Mr. Gibson ariived out in April, 18S6, and shortly af tervards wrote that everything connected with the affairs of the company had been going on well during his absence; that all the rents and bills up to that time had been paid; and concluded by sending a remittance for 1,0001. Under date the 17th of June he wrote that he had engaged a surveyor, who was now at work measuring and laying out the East Inlet for sale ; also some of the town allotments at Stanley. The same person would perform the work necessary at Emu Bay, and his services would be retained for marking out the proposed townships at the Black River and the River Cam. On the subiect of geld Mr. Gibson stated that explorations wiere going on ,at Fingal and other
places in the island, under the auspices of the local Govemment, to ascertain the fact as to whether or not there existed any goldfieldswhich were likely to repay the working. It was rumoured that some had been discovered near Deloraine. but the report required authentication. The low price of produce and these uncertain reports about gold contributed to keep the value of land very unsettled. On the importan question ef the communication by land to the neighbouring settled districts it appears that trogress continued to be made with the read leading from launeston that it had been already opene-d as far as the river Iersey- that it would jbe e.xtended the next season ho the Forth;* athat the trustees intendedtocarrytonto the river Ieven, and ultiasately to EmuBay. I the course of these operations lbridRes would he built by the trustees over those rivers which would remove one of the most serious diffculties felt
by the settlers in the transport of stock, &c. In this the only expense to the company would be the road assessment formerly referred to. Among other improvements a Plan -was in progress for laying down the electric telegraph from launceston, across the Straits to Idelbourne, to be carried
the seacoast, and passig over the company's lands at enc Bay and Circular Head. As regards the company's revenue, the rental of the farms on the peninsula was maiatained at fair rates, about 300 aores which had fallen in being relet at the yearly rent of 20s. per acre; while for the store buildings at Emu Bay, which had been let by publio
tender, a considerable advane had been obtained. The ast advies from Mr. Gibson were dated the 8th of
November, when he had completed his arrangements for I snaking his first sale of land at the East Inlet, on the Black RIver at Circular Head, ups awhich (areeably with the di. rections he had receivedffrom thi. side) he had laid out a new township of about 200 acres. The sale wMi comprise
about 2,000 acres of marsh and forest lend, a part of inferior
uali0,oshd telegphe transmits the Plans and survey, and uo,f ane oh the new town lots above referred to. The remittances received from the colony sinee the last annutl meeting amount to 3,3001.; they were delayed later thau

The advices in anticipation of the overland mail, just to hand, have had the effect of strengthening the market in regard to India goods, and the prices for Iovv qualities of shirtings, madapollamns, jaconots, andT-oloths which were asked on Tuesday have been fully supported.

Friday Evening.
The railway-market was rather heavy to-day, and, although no important change occurred in quotations, they were generally rather lower in the later hours. Caledonian formed the principal exception, purchases having caused a slight nnprovement. French and Belgian declined from 5s. to 15s. per share, the late advance having encouraged parties to realize. Ottoman Bank shares were irm; other descriptions exhibited scarcely any alteration, but there was general dulness at the close. Canada Land were again dealtin at 157 and 156, and left o ff 155 to 100. Riga shares were finally quoted2S to i pmn.; Punjab, ito fpm.; and Northern of Bengal, par to i pin.

A special meeting of this corpany was held yesterday at the omfice, Moorgate-street, Si J. Tylden i the chair.
MEr. Holroyd, the secretary, read the notico convening
On the motion of the CA IAtI, resolutions were passed, authorizing the directors to exercise the borrowing powers of the company to the extent of 233,3331.; also authorizing the board of directors to issuo, from time to time, without any right to a preference dividend, or with a right to a preference dividend not exceeding 5 per cent., such of the Dover Extension shares as have not been issued, and confirming a resolution of the board to raise the salary of the secretary from 3001. to 4001. a-year.
After a short conversation the meeting separated.
ERN13 BAY AND FAVERSHAL
An influential meeting of tho inhabitants of Herne Bay and neighbourhood was held at Ecrne Bay on Wednesday for the purpose of presenting a petition to Parliament in f.ivour oN the proposed line; Mr. Edward Hilton in the chair.
The CirIRmtAN stated that the meeting was called for she purpose of considering what course should be pursued in conseqcuence of a petition having been presented by the South-Eastern Company against the Bill for making a railway from Herne Bay to Faversham. He was not surprised at the course they had adopted, for it was in accordance with the policy they had pursued for the past 13 years. He believed thle time would come when the South-Eastern Company -would repent having adopted such a mode of proceeding.l (Cheers.)
Mr. HoLRoyr stated that the hill had been read the second time in the House of Commong, and that ab the last moment the South-Eastern Company had petitioned against it. The grounds of oppositionwere of a frivolous character; they alleged that the line was not wanted, and other things that were not true. He was happy to say that Lord Redesdale approved of the bill, ana it was evident that the inhabitants of the district required a direct line to London, which the proposed line would give them.
The Rev. G. GREAVES believed that at least 19-20ths of the inhabitants of Herne Bay were decidedly in favour of the line (hear, hear), and there could be no doubt the proposed line would be of the greatest benefit to Herne Bay.
Dr. Evans, Mr. Newton,-Mr. Hilton, Captain Slark, Mr. Perceval, Dr. Godfrey, and other gentlemen expressed their approval of the project. The distance would be redauced from 88 mniles by rail, and 6 miles by road, to OS miles by railway to London.
Resolutions were passed expressing regret that the South. Eastern company intended to oppose the Bill, and pledging the meeting to assist the promoters by every means in teir power, urging the necessity of obtaining authority as soon as possible to construct the lino, and approving a petition to Parliament in favour of the undertakhng. A great number of signatures were then attached to the petition, and the proceedings concluded with votes of thanks to the chairman of the meeting, and to the directors of the proposed
GLASGOW AND SOUTH-WESTERN.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held in Glasgow on Wednesday, the Hon. Andrew Orr, the LordProvost in the chair.
The report, an abstract of which appeared in 2wtc Times of Monday, was taken as read.
The CHAIRmIAN, in moving the adoption of the report. congratulated the shareholders on the improved position of their affair. Their increased receipts had tended to lessen the percentage of their working expenses, which were now 36q per cent., in place of 40 per cent. last year, and that event had been hastened by the facilities they had now for repairs in their new workshops. By the erection of dwelling. houses and other conveniencies on the co=pay's groundl they had been enabledl to mnake their workpeople com-. fortable and contented, and bring the whole more immediately under the eye of their manager. Of course the workmen paid rent for those houses, so that the capital afforded a fair return for tho outlay. The directirs in rotation visited the works weekly, and believed that tho result of the outlay would diminish expenditure. The rolling stock was in excellent order. Their disrosable balance of 82,000 was greater than in any former hl-year, and warranted the directors in recommending a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum, leaving a surplus of 2,851L The general business of the railway continued steadily to increase. Some complaints had been made of their fares and rates, but it should be remembered that the average dividends to the shareholders for the last seven
ad only been about 2 per cent.,-_ err smal return for their outlay. The average rate paid for t eir borrowed money was about 4 per cent. When the present directors came into office in 1849 the line paid no dividend, and the stock vas unsaleable at 341. (Cheers.)
ir. Bs.otUGH congratulated the shareholders on the satisfactory position which the affairs of the company had now attained.
The Hon. A. Orr aad Mr. R. Freeland were re-elected directors, anud Mr. P. Playf air was elected in room of Mr. Ellis, ret ired.
IThe ordinary resolutions, including one for the payment ofa dividend at the rate of 5 per cent., on Monday, the 30th of March, were agreed to, and the meeting separated.

The Art Treasures Exhibition, 1857.
THE ART TREASURES EXHIBrlIO1, 1857.
The offioe of President of the General Council'of the Exhibition, which became vacant by the lamented death of the Earl of Ellesmere, has been offered to and accepted br the R ight Hon. the Lord Overstone. On the first announceiment of the projected Exhibition it was universally felt that no fitter appointment could have been made than that of the noblemnan just deceased, as well on account of the high place he held in the world of Art and Letters, as from his official position in the county of Lancaster and his intimate connexion by residence and property with the city of Msanchester. Lord Overstone, however, was also one of the earliest supporters of the scheme-which has now undoubtedly assurmed a character of national importance-is a large contributor, and at a very early stage evinced his appreciation of the beneficial reaults which were then likely and are now sure to flow from the enlarged conceptions of the committee by sldng to contribute to the fund which guara.ntees the large outlay to be incurred. These circtam. stances established an intimate connexion with the Exhibition, which at once pointed to his Lordship as the first and fittest person to whom to offdr the distinction of the presidency, and it has been accepted, no doubt, with an earnest desire to promote in every way the entire success ef a highly instructive and deeply interesting work.
As the attention of the executive committee is now almost exclusively directed to the reception and arrangement of tlio various contributions, and within a very few weeks tbe palace, containing the most precious and most notable treasures of art of Great Britain, will be formally opened to the public, wo shall not have the opportunity of further noticing the offers made to the Exhibition, It is therefore with pleasure that, as the last, though not least, incentive to the curiosity of the general ptblic, as well asof connoisseurs and those who are even deeply versed in the records of the great sales of Messrs. Christie and Manson And Qthers, we can announce the following magnificent contribution of 4Z pictures by the Marquis of Hertford, K.G. The committee may indeed congratulate themselves upon their success in having gained the opportunity of making known to the world the beauties and rare value of this nobleman's possessions. The 42 pictures enumerated below-which in round numbers cannot be worth less than lOO,OOO.-would form an exhibition in themselves which would attract thousands of visitors to Manchester from all parts of England. They have nearly all been acquired by the present Lord, who, whenever or wherever any work of real merit or value offered itself, was sure to be present in the person of his trusty agent, Mr. M3wson, with a determined will and an apparently inexhaustible purse, to securo it for the Hartford Gallery.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-In these days of invention, when our cousins from across the Atlantic are daily bringing us the most simple and useful inventions in the way of portable boats, it is galling to receive such a letter as that the post has brought me this morning from an officer who owes his life, in common with the entire regiment to which he belongs and a magnificent ship's crew, to the fact of there having been for 48 hours unusnally fioe weather in the treacherous Bay of Biscay.
Her Majesty's steamship Urgent, after passing some six weeks in dry dock at Portsmouth repairing the damages caused by a regular break-down the voyage before, and after having been found in " perfect order" by the Admuiral of the station, sailed on the last day of February with a full crew and between 600 and 700 officers and men of the 49th Regiment, bound for Barbadoes. The run out of Channel and across the Bay was splendid-fine, calm weather, and no heavy sea to strain the ship; all seemed going well, when, on the morning of the 3d inst,, a leak was sprung of such magnitude that the captain told the Colonel commanding the troops the vessel was in " imminent danger." Soldiers and sailors went to work at the pumps, and the ship's head was put about for Corunna. About 10 p.m. she neared the land, but a dense fog obliged her to knock about outside till daylight, when she ran in and anchored about 8 a.m. The whole of this time the pumps had been kept going incessantly, and now the water was sufficiently reducod to ascertain that the leak arose from the bursting of a pipe connocted with one of the valves of the engine. This has been plugged up in the best way possible, with the intention to continue the voyage to tho West Indies, taking in coals en route at Madeira.
Now, Sir, these continual mishaps to Government vessels are bad enough; but what can besaid to the fact that "it was discovered when the boats were being got ready that thero would not be accommodation for one-third of the persons on board ?' The most competent judges were of opinion that, but for the providentialy fine weather, the leak could not have been got under, and then there would have been nothing but the boats to trust to, for the ship must have foundered. Theso facts I have from a man of tried courage,-ono who has been many a voyage in the service of bis country, and who onght to known more about the way these things aro managed than the Parliamentary red-tape apologists, who, liko Mr. Frederick Peel, inform the House every now and then that accidents of this kind are quite in the way of business.
Not one of the indignant relatives of the men whose lives have been jeopardizedwillbeinducedby anyamount of official flummery to believe, first, that a vessel just out of dry dock after a complete overhaul ought to break down after stem. ing a few hundred miles in a calm sea; secondly, that some 9I00 men ought to have been sent to sea with boat accommodation in case of accident for only 300 or so. But nothing I can say can be more bitterly satirical than the opening paragraph of the letter I have before me :-" Your surprise at hearing from me will be lessened when you reflect that I am on board one of those Government steamers which it is notorious always break down."

To the ELECTORS of NOTTINGHIL Gentlemen,
rHE Government having resolved to appeal to the & couintry in coeaequence of the defeat which it has recently airs-
tadt in the Honue of Commons, it will shortly become your duty to determine to who you wil intrt the i rtn goo r t inz you in the next PArliament,
Without going into the ments of the Chiuese questIon, which would carr me beyond the liomits of a pelnlmaxjy address I winl ,erely ohserve that a vote of censure upon the ,.overntoent-founded uoosi transactjoiss for which it Was 00 waY Thcrspoble, hutt which. having occurred. it cmuld not poe#ibly repudiate, and which any other Government would have been equally compelled to vindhcsts,-
was a proceeding tint ieee irrational In itself thau unhandsome towa s a Ministr -who, whatever mnay be his faults, has the maerit of having rescued his country frora the disgrace which was well nigh being inilictod upon it by the Tery mneu who were Instrumental tic defeating him.
With regrd to the domestic policy of the country, my oprWnsco remain subatantaily the same as when I last had the honour of addresalug you. lIa the complicated machinery of our political system the voice of publc opinioi, more powerful now than ever fr to compeneate the existtng inequalities and anomalies in the dfotnabtion of political privileges, acd sometimes provides the mneans of redress for gievanes which Parliament itoelf has faied to remeey. At r te eaine time, while I attach great weight to this couidemcjon I am folly convinced that a free constitution like our own cannot be m~ainlained in health without such an occasional revision and extension of the franchise as the lOtered cireutmtnces and the gin intpee nces
t mave the honour to emain. g ientleuein

LOW7DON, SATUBDAY, MfARCH 14, 1857.
In the House of Lords last night,
Lord C niaam. gave notice that, owing to the impending dissolution of Parliament, he did not yropose to proceed any furtherwith the committee or inquiring into the freedom of reports.
Lord DERBnY gave notice that on 3Ionhday next, I when the Income-tax Bil was read a second time,
be intended to make some remarks on the circamstances under which an appealwas about to be made to the country.
The Marquis of CLAmIrcA.DX moved for the
correspondence connected with the cost of the' expedition to Persia. It appeared that half the expense was to be charged to the revenue of India; but, considering that the normal condition of Indian
finance was a deficit, %mounting latterly to I 2,000,0001. a-year, and that the new loans proposed had not been taken up, it was bard to see how the Indian Government was to Jind the money.
The Earl of MAIMESBuRY complained that the country, on the eve of a dissolution, was left in complete ignorance as to the Persian war. That war had been begun, carried on, and concluded without one word of information having been given on the subject by the Government. He was aware that, technicaUy speaking, the treaty could not be laid before Parliament until it had been ratified; but still he thought a sketch of its details might be afforded before the dissolution.
The Earl of CLAEN2-ov, after this appeal from Lord MAL{ESBRiy, proceeded to lay before the House the chief stipulations of the treaty recently signed between the British and Persian Governments, and concluded by saying there was nothing in those stipulations contrary to the honour or interests of Persia. It was, in fact, a treaty which, if faithfully carried out in the spirit in which it had been negotiated, would be for the mutual advantage of both countries.
The Earl of ELLEh-sOROUGH thought the 'War was justifiable if it aimed alone at preventing the occupation of Herat, the gate of India, by the Persians. Whatever might be said to the contrary, and though Russia for the time might have reconsidered her position and refrained from hostile advances, it -was certain that the march of a Russian army on India was no impossibility. Much had been said of railways and telegraphs and canals in India, but it must never be forgotten that our empire in the East was founded by the sword and must be maintained by the sword. It was on well equipped, well disciplined, and well commanded armies that our ascendancy i India depended. Now, when he looked back on the events of the last few months, the prospect of affairs in the East filled him with dismay. We had two wars on our hands, both owing to bad appointments. To Sir JonN BOWBING we were indebted for the Chinese war, and to Mr. MuRuLxY for that with Persia. The talent required to manage Orientals was altogether peculiar, and however great Mr. MuitumRY's ability might have been in Europe he was quite incompetent to manage matters in the East.
The Earl of CLARENDoX defended the appointment of Mr. MURRAY, who, so far from having no Oriental experience, had scpent six years of his life in the East, and was so thoroughly acquainted with Oriental languages as to be able to converse fluently with the Schah of PrnSu. in his own language.
After some further discussion the motion was agreed to.
Some other business was then despatched, and their lordships adjourned.
In the House of Commons, on the motion that the House at its rising do adjourn until Monday, in reply to questions put by Sir A. CQrBsmL, respecting the Persian treaty,
Lord PALIERSTON observed that it was very inconvenient to discuss a treaty before the House was in possession of it; but, without discussing the treaty, he could say that very great inconvenience had arisen, and was likely to arise, from a practice in Persia by which foreign Powers were entitled to exercise a protection over Persian subjects, and that it would be for the benefit of Persia herself if the practice could be discontinued. It was not, indeed, for the advantage of one country to abstain from the practice while it continued to be pursued by another, but HER MAJEsTY's Government would be happy to renounce all right and protection over Persiansubjects, except those inBritish employment, if other countries, and especially Russia, made the same renunciation.
Mr. LAYARD said thero was a more serious question, whether the terms agreed to by the Persian Ambassador at Paris were not offered at Constantinople, and that the Persian Ambassador had not been even willing to give more. He lamented the effects of the operations in the Persian Gulf, which, Le said, had converted a friendly tribe into blood enemies.
Lord PAL-1%ERsToN said the negotiations at Constantinople had been broken off by Ferak Khan himself.
The motion for the adjournment was withdrawn. The House having resolved itself into a Committee,
Lord PA.IzERSTON moved a resolution to give effect to the mnessage of HaER MAJESTY, in reply to the address of the House on the retirement of the SPEA;ER, that an annuity of 4,)001. be placed at the disposal of HER MaJFszv to be granted to the Right Hon.CnAnLEs SHAAW LEFEVRE, upon his retirement from the office of Speaker.
The motion was agreed to 7wn. con.
On the report of the Committee of Supply,
MIr. C. VIzLIERS gave an explanation with reference to what had faUen from General PEEL the preceding evening respecting the political opinions of the Board of General Officers at Chelsea.
Mr. STAFFORD made some remarks regarding the Army Medical Department, which were answered by Mr. F. PrEL.
The report was agreed to, as well as the report of Ways and Means.
In a Committee of Ways and Means a vote was agreed to out of the Consolidated Fund to cover the supplies voted during the session.
Various BiUs were read a third time and passed.
The Mutinyand Marine Mutiny Bils were brought in and read a first time.
The House adjourned at a quarter to 6 o'clock.
The Earl of ELGIN has accepted the office of
The EDrl of ErIGi has accepted the office of Plenipotentiary to the Court of Pekin, and will proceed on his arduous mission as soon as he has been made sufficiently acquainted with the views of HER MA'JESTY'S Government. It would not be easy to name a more unexceptionable man for the office, or even one with so many positive recommendations. Lord ELGEN performed with admirable tact and entire success the task of conductincg Canada from govemrnent by cliques and Imperial influences to that system of self-government which has rendered the provinces of British America an honour, and even a support, to the British Throne, instead of a scandal and a thorn ;n our side. He also successfully negotiated the Treaty for Reciprocity of Trade between British America and the United States. Of course, there were those 'vho opposed both these processes, and therefore did not like the agent employed; but they are now a minority, if not converts to the system which he helped to inaugurate. Lord ELGnI is a man of great industry, patience, and forbearance, with ready powers of expression, and a great desire to accommodate himself to the habits of those with whom he has to deal. So well did he disebarge the delicate, and, as some thought, impossible task, of turning Canadian rebels into British Royalists without any sacrifice of Imperial dignity, that his popularity extended even across the frontier, and ovations were offered him by the citizens of the adjacent States. He will not be objected to, therefore, by those who apprehended that we were going to carry matters with a high hand over the silly barbarians to whom he is now accredited. It ii almost superfluous, however, to insist on his qualification when not a single objection has been alleged against him, though his name has been whispered aboun for the appointment from the very day that it was announced. Othernames, indeed, have been thought of, either for their higher rank or their diplomatic repuitation, but not one for which so much could be said, and against which so little could even be alleged. This becomes a matter of serious importance when it is considered that not only are two Empires, the wide world apart, and as different as day and night, to be reconciled, but factions at home almost as discordant and hostile to be won into concurrence. It is not to be supposed that because politicians speak as if London streets were full of
conipetent men therefore they would be satisfied with anybody; on the contrary, it is from this glib and easy quarter that we are the most likely to find any actual choice denounced and vituperated the moment it is made. In Lord EMiH, then, we have a man for whom the opinions of most men are already engaged, and, though that does not secure him from criticism, it must help to absolve those with whom rests the responsibility of the choice.
We apprehend, however, that Lord ELGsn'S instructions will be so few and plain that he wiU scarcely have much opportunity of going wrong. Of course, after the failure of the Emperor of CHrNA to enforce the observance of the former Treaty on the refractory and almost independent Cantonese, and after the consequent rupture we have now to deplore, it wiU be necessary to demand fuller means of communication with the officials and population of China, and that the engagement shall on no account be evaded or postponed. Whatever demands are made will be in the interest of aU nations, and very much, as we firmly believe, in the interest of the Chinese themselves. For our part, we do not believe that any part of this earth was made for the exclusive use and enjoyment of any one particular race. In point of fact, miUions of the Chinese cannot live without us and the use we make of our share of the earth's surface, and as little can we do without them and the hill slopes they cover with the fragrant and restorative tea plant. 'We allow the Chinese to enter our colonies and our great commercial ports, to share our commerce and divide our goldfields. They have the free range of every town, village, street, or road in the British dominions. It is only a matter of convenience whether we insist on a reciprocity of commumication to this extent through the territory of China. But we beg to observe very emphaticaDly,-and we press it on the notice of all whom it may concern,-that since it is a matter of necessity for us to give the Chinese sometliing for their silk and tea, and no trade on earth can be carried on for ever on the condition of money and money only for goods -and since out of this necessity has arisen that irregular traffic in opium which the more narrowminded philanthropists-that is, about ninety-nine out of a hundred of them-are always laying to the charge of England,-not only our interest, but our reputation and humanity itself, demand that we should have every opportunity of substituting some other merchandise than opium. It has been said, indeed, that the Chinese have so few wants, and that labour is so cheap there, that we can never hope to bring our manufactures into competition with theirs, even if it were humane to drive their labour out of the field. As the same objections have been made to every stop in the economy of labour, the extension of trade, and the commercial intercourse of nations everywhere and in every age, we set them down at their proper worth. For our part, then, we admit no limit to what we may demand from these whniusical, subtle, and faithless barbarians, so long as our demands are regulated by equity and in the interest of all nations. What it may at this moment be convenient to demand is another affair, and one which we presume may be left to HER IAJ-ESTY'S advisers.
No doubt, any dcmands whatever which may be thought an adequate result for a great expedition sent across the globe will be unpalatable to the barbaric pride or politic jealousy of the Chinese Government. Nor are three hundred millions of people to be despised who, ignoront as they may be of the art of war, are not the less crafty and cruel. It is therefore a service both of difficulty and danger that Lord ELorx has undertaken. Though be will not advance sword in hand, and will not, therefore, fulfil Lord ELLaNa1-OIJOHn'S ideal of the only competent negotiator, he will have his way prepared by a large naval and military armament. When the Commander-in-ChiefGeneralPExN-iFATnER-ham made the proper dispositions, and is ready for an advance, the British Plenipotentiary will, we suppose, invite the EnPEROR to a peaceful settlement of affairs, and under the present deplorable circumstances of the Chinese Government it is not likely that our chief difficulty will be in that quarter. It has, indeed, been insinuated that we ought not to have taken advantage of an hotur of distress and perplexity to press our claims; but it is the Imperial crisis itself which has brought on the rupture, Commissioner YFxr having notoriously presumed for a long period on his security from Imperial control. The Plenipotentiary will have to deal, then, not only with the EmPER(R and his Mandarins, but with his insolent Viceroys, and with a rebeUion almost everywhere victorious. It is likely enough, therefore, that circumstances will arise which may require great discretion, temper, and even courage. Lord ELGOx, however, must have counted the cost, and can form some estimate from the experience of his colonial task. Should he meet with success his wiU be a singular lot and a unique glory in achieving two great works of reconciliation so wide apart and under such various circumstances.
Coming events, according to the old saying,
Coming events, according to the old saying, cast their shadows before them, and such a shadow of the approachir,g appeal to the constituencies was the City Meeting of yesterday. First in point of time, as first in importance, the election for the city of London is always supposed to exercise a very material influence over the decisions of the provincial constituencies, and rightly so. The voters for the City represent not only the trade and commerce of the Empire, but many among them have large possessions in the various counties-large interests at stake at the various seats of manufacture-large amounts embarked in the various mineral undertakings in the mining districts of these islands. Their fleets cover every sea; their relations with the colonies represent the ties which unite the seat of empire with its dependencies in all quarters of the globe. It would be strange indeed if the opinion of such a constituency did not exercise a very notable influence upon the opinions of others-or rather if it did not serve as a manifestation of what those opinions would be. Now, although an amendment was moved yesterday to the original resolution proposed by Mr. RA}zXS CuRRIE, yet even the few persons who held up their hands for the amendment, as well as its proposer, virtuaUy acknowledged that Lord PALmEMTOsoI ought to be supported through the present crisis by the solerm adhesion of the country. They, indeed, would have united with their disapprobation of his opponents an expression of their opinion that the Premier was bound to unite with his foreign policy a stronger leaven of domestic reform. They did not, however, propose to attain their end by excluding Lord PALirap.Tox from office, and by constituting a fresh Cabinet out of the scattered members of the Coalition. The vote for direct confidence in Lord PALYYnRsTox was overwhelming, but even those who would bave impugned his home policy did not at all desire to see Lords DERBY and GREY, M1r. GLADSTONE and Mr. DISRAELT, Sir JAMNFS GBARAHA and Mr. COBDEN seated together on the Treasury benches. The political opponents of the Premier, in their hurry to malke their attack, have compromised its success. Even had Lord PAL3iEPsTON been as greatly wrong as in the opinion of the country hce was greatly right in
supporting Sir Jo0ri Bowsr q_ and AdmifT.. Sziroun, he had not as, yet 6utlived the". popularity vhich he had gained by the conduct of the late war. It was something to have assumed the reins of office when they had faUen from the feeble, unnerved hands of professed statesmen who may be fiery in their invective, ingenious in their argu-
ments, dexterous in Parliamentary tactics, and of I flowing speech; but the electors of the city of London had not forgotten, as this country will
never forget, that in the hour of trial, when the 5 destinies of theEmpire were imperilled, their courage failed them-they trembled in the presence of danger. The honour of the country was at stake, and they would have " hedged." With all. this odium upon them, it is somewhat too soon to talk of a renewal of confidence. They were trusted, as men can only be trusted once in a lifetime, and they broke down. Now, Lord PAxeEnrTo;, whatever his faults of omission or commission may be, proved himself a true man when all was uncertain and dark around himi. lie may not be as quick with a measure for Parliamentary Reform as one gentleman may wish; he may not advance as rapidly in Lawv Reform as another may desire, bkit at least he can guide the chariot of the State with a steady eye and with a firm hand. W e have frequently occasion to attack the acts of his Administration, and we do so freely, but it is not because a Reform Bill is left for a future Parliament-it is not because measures for the improvement of our laws are not introduced with the earnestness which we look fo5i upon so important a subject, that we would now aid in transferring the Government of this country from his hand into those of his political antagonists.
The present crisis must be looked upon as a whole. The question is, who among the statesmen now upon the political stage is to give the tone to the administration of affairs for the next few years ? ShaU we take Lord Dri.r s.
the great reformer, the friend of the people? As AMr. J. DLLLoN said yesterday, "Above all "things, keep out the Derbyites-let us re" sist the invasion of the European China" men; let them not board the vessel of the State, " or drag down the flag of the Empire; let them C not assassinate the characters of our envoys, or "poison the political food of the people." All this is figurative enough, to be sure; but, substantially, there is truth at the bottom of it. In the present attitude of European affairs, the advent to office of Lord DERnY and the Coalitionists would be a national calamity. The mark that they have imprinted upon European policy whieh is most obvious at the present moment is the Neuchatel difficulty. About tho war in China we say nothing; for, whether Lord DEnny or Lord PALMPSTON be in office, that affair must take its course. There will be no pausc nor cessation until the Chinese are convinced by sad experience that they cannot hamper our trade nor slaughter our countrymen with impunity. As to home policy, as was well observed by one of the speakers yesterday in the Guildhall, all persons who desire a more rapid progress in Liberal siieasures have only to elect a Liberal Parliament and put Lord P.U'MBPRSTON at the head of a strong Liberal majority, and he will be compelled to swim with the streami. What the chances of re-election for Lord JoHN RtSSFLL are with such a constituency as that of the city of London it is not of course for us to predict, but it would certainly appear as though every reason assigned for supporting the Address to Lord PALXEESTON told with fatal effect upon the course which his feeble rival has too long pursued. The Coalitionists must, ere this, have discovered the fatal error of their policy. They have sent their opponent to the country with the most popular of aU cries. They have established his tenure of power, which upon another system of tactics was fairly open to attack.
When FREDERICK the GREAT was preparing for
WKhen FREDERICK the GREAT was preparing for one of his renowned campaigns it is related that he displayed the utmost anxiety about the quantity of vinegar -which every soldier should receive, and when the Duke of WELLINGTON was considering the highest operations of war he took the accoutrements of a private, put them into a scale, and weghed them with careful accuracy and patient thought. The moral of these twvo little stories shows how the greatest masters of military science reduced it at once to a single fundamental pointthe efficiency of the individual soldier. The Prussian G:neral k-new that vinegar was the particular article necessary to insure the health of his troops ; the British General felt that if a man had too much to carry he could not march, aiid that if he could not march he would never be in a position to fight with advantage. As an illustration of the same idea, we refer our readers to Lord ELLFa;nOtOUIc'S speech in the House of Lords on Thursday last, where, in moving for some returns relating to our Supplementary Treaty with China in 1843, he took the opportunity to make sonie observations npon the impending operations in the East. In these remarks there is no lofty talk about the power of the British arms, no soaring into generalities, no groveling adhesion to official traditions, but simply a few straightforward practical recommendations, arising out of the nature of the service on hand. The importance of time in such operations is calculated with the utmost nicety. If our expedition had been despatched in January instead of March the season and chances would have been more favourable. The voyage, moreover, will be very long, anid the weather probably oppressive. The vessels ought to have awnings, and not common single awnings, but double awnings, such as wvould keep out both sun and rain, and moreover collect the rain when it fell. If troops were too much crowded in transports it would be destructive to their strength, Snpplies, too, would be precarious; the men would want fresh meat, and, as the Chlinese would very lik-ely not furnish it, preserved meats shouild be provided, and, more tl an that, it should be carefully ascertained that these preserved meats were good. Such was the purport of Lord ELLENDOROUORI'S remarks, the gist of the whole being this very simple proposition,that our object should be to bring every individual soldier in the primest possible condition to the Canton waters at the earliest possible moment, and make good provision for his comfort when he got there.
We have not a doubt about the true wisdom of suggestions like these, nor do we forget that Lord ELLEicBOROrtn spoke about the Crimean campaigns with a foresight wvhich was but too well justified by events. We trust, however, that on the present occasion the contingencies are by no means so Eerious. Lord ELLmNBOPtOUGo himself observed, that " we were not at war with the "Emperor of CHiiNA, but withi the people of Can"ton," andc that " our operations, whatever they "might be, should be confined to Canton, for "with Canton only at present had we a cause
of war." But this surely limits most materiall. the nature and risk of the ser%ice in prospec .
In fact, it appears to us that, when precautions are taken for the safety of our other settlements in China and the Straits, the population of Canton can hardly, accordin,g to the description of affairs received, oppose much beyond a defensive front to the British forces. Sir MIICHAEL SEYnoun wrote to Commissioner YEr as lODg ago as
iho 30th of October, "I have now one remark "to make, to which I request your Excel" lency's particular attention. The lives and "property of the entire city population are 6at my mercy, and could be destroyed by 4C me at any moment that any crent might
impose on me so sad a necessity." We know, moreover, that the walLs of Canton were actually breached, and that our troops penetrated to YEnes own residence, on which achievemeut Mr. PAnxxS reported, " It has been accomplished with a loss
of only five casualties on our side, and, as a "little more firing will widen the breach so that
we can march in and out at pleasure, the city is as much under our command as if we held a 4' position on the walls." A very natural deduction from these passages might seem to be, that if we were only at war witlh Cantoni, and Canton was at our command, there could be no great diffi'culty attending the expedition.
Apart, however, from the teachiing of that most znemorable maxim, that no enemy is to be despised, we can at once discern the circumstances which -render it imperative upon us both to reinforce -our Commanders on the spot and to take every possible measure for insuring the safety of our -operations. In the first place, and above all, it 3nust be recollected that the actual state of things, although testifying to the superiority of our arms, is by no means a desirable one; for the initerests of all parties require not simply that we should be masters -of the Canton river, but that we shouild be on good, terms with China. Our object is not merely asceidancy in the quarrel, but the establishment -of amicable relations on the best footing for the future. In some way or other,-by peaceful negotiation if possible-by coercion if necessary-we anust obtain, either from YEn hiniself or from those who can control him, an adjustment of the affair -on such conditions as are fair and reasonable. lord PA;MURTE said, very truly, that so long as our demands were framed in accordance with justice the honour and character of the British nation required that we should not stop till we had obtained them; and to this result no means are more likely to conduce than the despatch of snch a force as will give erTect to our proposals. WVe cannot, in short, stop where we are, and we caunot proceed without an augmentation of strength. The whole -quarrel, we sincerely trust, will be settled without -any further operations; but this settlement will -certainly be facilitated by our appearance in proper force upon the scene.
At the same time, it would be useless to disguise -the difficulties which may await us in case of the obduracy of the Chinese authorities. Wlhatever -efforts we niay use, oiur forces must still represent a mere hanidful of men in comparison with the -swarming population of even the southerm provinces of tbe Chinese Empire. WVe may subdue and taLe possession of forts, but prlidence would often advise us to evacuate thelm again ; we may -effect an cntrance into Canton, but we may have to retire after doing so; we may command the -Canton water, but we may be liable to the attacks -of fireships or any other insidious contrivances. Some of these liabilities, in fact, have been already -exempliGed in the operations acttually conducted, and Lortd ELLExnoRoursi alluded with niatuiral anxiety to the chance of others. iMoreover, the climate is not wholesome for European troops, nor the country adapted to the supply of necessary provisions, while it must always be recollected that there are other points besides Canton at which British interests are at stake. Against these -considerations, however, fraught as they are with salutary admonitions, we may balance others of no small weight. Either we shall have to contend against the Government of China, or, as may bh hoped, against the Governor of Canton. Even in the formner event it can hardly be anticipated that a Power which proved unable to resist our operations some years ago, when in full enjoyment of its resources, should be more competent to do so now, when shorn of 3ialf its strength by a successfuil insurrection. In the latter case, whatever may be the obstinacy of CommissioIIer YExI, the war will be confined, at any rate, to a limited area, and to a scene on -which, by the very configuration of the ground, our naval superiority will give us vast advantages. Mord PA-.iMuRE, indeed, remarked that our troops would be qluartered on board our vessels, in the spacious borths of the Himalaya and her consorts; *that our ships would form the base of our operations, and that this was one of the reasons for despatching them of such size and burden. There would, therefore, be little prospect of any trying or protracted land service, while there would be every opportunLity for employing all the precautions which experience may suggest. We sre told, indeed, that " the head of the Commis" sariat Department, the head of the Medical DeCC partmcnt, andthe head of the Store Department" are to be sent out so as to arrive long in advance of the troops, and make prepatations for their -arrival ; nor is it to be forgotten, in contemplating -our prospects, that China is no new country to us now. We have been engaged in a Chinese war before, and are acquainted with the power and Itactics of our enemy. 'We earnestly trust that nothing beyond negotiation may be necessary to bring a good settlement to pass, but, if we must needs jput forth onr strength, we can afford, we hope, to rely upoII it with such confidence as to employ it 'vith consideration and forbearance.

The CH 1 tA hi said, they were about to exorcise a privilege which as Englishmen they highly prized- to decide whom they should cal upon to represent them in Parliameat. Of course they were prepared to expect differences of opnon, and he was not gicng to discuss the conduct of their present representatives. but at the last election he voted for Mr. Gibson and Mx Bright because, under the paculiar circumstanecs of the country with Lord Derby in power, he conceived that free trade was in danger.c
conceived that the exertions of Mr. Bright in that cause called for the gratitude and suhpport of his fellow citizens, and he hopd he was not forgetful of the claima of t pubi c men under such circumetances. All things being equal, he would have thiought Minr. Bright and Mr. Gibson entitled to his support on the present occasion, but since the last election circum-
stances had very muaterially changed. (Hear, hear.) U n 3 nianjy questions in the present Plarliament Mr. Bright Cd not represented his (Mr. Neord's) opinions, and he was sure he ortoke the sentiments of thousands; besides

A moeeting of Liberal electors was hold yesterday afternoon at the Royal Hotel, Dale-street, for tle purpose of adopting measures for securing the return of Mr. Joseph Christopher Ewart, M.P. There ws an influential gathering, and the chair was occupied by Mr. Thonas Broouele bank.
Mpr. WILLIAts R,vTanohr. moved a resolution to the following effect:
"That this meeting dpoirs to expres tami increased confidener In ur. Joseph Christopher Ewart. M.P., d pledges itself hy very logiticate mean, to promote his re-election for the borough of Liverpool..
it depended, he said, upon the electors whether they wero to hiave the oame "do little, talking Parliament" next session as they had in the lest, which, in his humible opiniou, was about the worst Parliament that had ever disgraced the kingdom. (Cheers.) Measaes were 'wantedrfor the cleansing of the Augean stables of the Administration in all departments. (Hear, hear.)

Mr. WILLIAx EARLE Said, the greatest comapliment that cotld be paid to a man had been paid to Mr. Ewart by his political opponents, and that was that he was an honest man, which was saying a great deal mnore than could be alleged with regard to the majority of the so-called "1honouarable," but what he considered dishonourable members. MFr. Turner was a determnined Derbyite, and would use all his

Before separating it was aunounced that an aggregate meeting of thie Liberal party would be held at the Am hitheatre on Tuesday evening, at which Mr. E wart wilbe present.

NOTTINGHAM.
There is no probability of any opposition to the return of Mr. Walter and Mr. Paget, r. 'Walter has justissued the following address:-
" The Governmeut having resolved to appeal to the country in consequence of the defeat which it has recntly sustained in the House of Conimons, It will shortly become your duty to determine to whom you will intrust the important charsgeof representing you inlthmenext PrHaimeut.
' Without going into the merits of the Chinese question, which wouid carry me beyond the limits of a preliminary address, I will merely observe that a vote of censure upon the Government-oeunded upon transactions for which it was no way responiible, but which, hav. iujg oocurred, It could not posaibly repudiate, and whioh any other Government wouldhave been equaUy comPelled to vidicate,-was a Droceeding not less irrational in itself than unhandsome towards a Mltiister who, whatever may be his faults, has the merit of having reacued his rcontry from the disgrace which wasweon nigh being infifcted upon it by the very men who vere instrumentaw in dereating
" With regard to the domestic policy of the ocountry, mY ophnioni romain subhtantially the same as when I last had the honour of addresaing you. Inuthe complicated m3chineryofourpolitcalsystem. the voice of public opinion, more powerful now thau ever, goes far to compensate the existing inequaiities and anomalies of the distribution of political privileges, and sometimes provides tho means of redress for grievances whlih Parliament Itseif has failed to remedy. At the same time, while I attach great weight to this consideration, I am fully convinced that a free constitution like our own cannot be maintained ln health without such anoccasional revision and extension of the franchise as the altered circumstances and the growing intelligence of the country may from time to time require.
I iwillonly add that, in seeking a renewal of the confidence whiah for nearly 10 years you have generously reposed In me, I can neither forget the eircumstances under which it was originally bestowed nor the debt of gratitude which the lenegtbened enjoyment of it has Imposed upon me. Your debtor I must ever rerDain ; but my beot services wiu almlys be at your command as long as you shall think fit to honoursee with your conlfidence."
BEWDLEY AND STOURPORT.-Yesterday Sir Thomas Winnington, the sitting member for,this borough, issued an address to the electors, soliciting a renewal of the trust heretofore confided to him. As to the last vote he wvrstes :
" To the Governmnt of Lord Palmerston we oOwe important services, and I deeply regretted my unaroidable abeencO in another country on the recent vote, which so materially alileted its existence."
BfRcXINGmal.-Messrs. hMuntz and Scholefield have issued addresses to the electors of this borough soliciting re-election. There does not appear to be the sU.hItest attempt made at an opposition.
BRAtDFORD.-Mr.Wickham, AP., has issued his addres. On Thursday afternoon a large and influenitia inlueting o Mr. Wickhaia's supporters was held at the Exch - TMre hon. member's assiduouLs and uniform devotion to nL ayliamentary duties was gladly recognized. It was declared that his vote on the Chinese question would endear him to the constituency by stronger ties even than hitherto, and the large meeting unanimously pledged itsolf tE secure his return at the coming election. In the meantime the separate committees of Mlr. Titus Salt (Liberal) and Major. General Thompson (Radical) are busy organizing their course of action. The more advanced section of Liberals, beIng unwilling to accept Mr. Wickham as a representative, are bringing out General Thompson. After the meeting on Monday night a requisition to the gallant General was prepared, and received about 70 signatures immediately. At preseint, then, Mr. Wickham is in the field, and separate a&id independent efforts are being made to bring out two Liberals.
BucKs.-A rumour prevails tbroughout many parts of the county that two gentlemen of Idberal principles will be started, in conjunction with the Hon. C. C. Cavendish, in opposition to hlr. Disraeli and MIr. Da Pre. Should such turn out to be true, one or both the Tory candidates will be ousted. A strong feeling prevails at Eton, Slough, Marlow, High Wycombe, and Amersham in favour of thepolicy pursued by Lord Palnerston. Mr. Abram Darby, of Stokecourt, and Mr. Rice R. Clayton are the gentlemen reered
to as likely to become candiaates.
CA'tnBsIDoE COUNTY.--A requisition, numerouslysi ned, has been presented to Mr. Pichard Yorng, of Osborne.
house, Wisbech, merchant and shipowner, soliciting him to beIcome a candidate at the approaching election, as one of the representatives of the county of Cambridge and Isle of Ely. MIr. Young is a Liberal Conservative, and a wvarm supporter of Lord Palmerston's Administration.
inCtonERsGoyero Henry Gren ell offers himself for Chester
cntsequence of the retirement of Mr. W. 0. Stanley. In the course of his address Mr. Grinfell says;-
hI have secn wita regre the factious ceoperaton of rious parrled
in the House of Commons for the ohjept of hreaking np Lord Palmerston'is GoYerunsssne, to WhIch the coutryt owes a deep debt of rortisude for the energ with which they serected tibe late w ar, and for the firmness with hloeh they iesited upoa securIng the ohxects of it, in spits of difflcult negetiatloes and waeridn allies. With respect to China, I etunet conceal myr apprehension that the resolution arrived at by the lIouse of Commonos msy tend to pXrolong and Incerase the her. rors of the war which our woulWt.e philnthrpists ace so reedy to desr;eno. I cousloer that the intereste of the British muerchant in Cbina ar of the same importance as these of the English manufacturer at home, and that he has thle ame right to protection for hi, isfe and pruperty."
ClIrPPENHAMr.-The present members for the borough offer themselves for re-election. Colonel Boldero's seat is considered safe. The Liberal party have put in nomination
r. W. J. Lysley, a gentlenan of large landed property in the district, who unsuccessfully contested the borough in 184L Much dissatisfaction is expressed at the vote lr. Nsiahet gave against Lerd Palmuerstoms's Administration~ amid as Mr. Lyaley declares himself a supporter of the ytarmh
Government his election is considered safe, although the contest may be severe.
Divo1SEsHBcs.-The numerous addresses issued in Exeter indicate severe contests in the northern division of the county and in several of the boroughs. Mr. I,. W. Back, as we announced in The Times of Thursday, has retired fronm the representation of North Devon, and since then his colleague, Sir T. D. Acland, has issued an address to the electoys, taking leaving leave of them after 20 years' service. Mr. George Stuckley Back, son of Mr. L W. Buck, the present member for Barnstaple, has announeed his determinatiom to retire from the representation of that borough and become a candidate for North Devon in the room of his father. Sir S. H. Northcote, Bart., the present member for Dudley, has also issued an address to the electors of North Devon, offering himself as a candidate. The Hon. C. W. Trefusis, eldest son of Lord Clinton, it is said will also come forward as a candidate, so that there will be three Conservatives in the field. Sir S. H. Northcote and the Hon. W. Trefusis in all probability will be supported by Sir T. D. Acland, Earl Fortesque, and the Hon. Mark Role (brother to the Hon. Mfr. Trefusis), who have large estates and great interest in the county.
DuIDLEY.-Sir Stafford Northcote will again offer himself for this borougb, so that the rumour of his probable intention of seeking the suffrages of the North Devon electors is unfounded.
DuRHAx CouNTY (NoRTH).-Lord Adolphus Vane Tempest, the Conservatve member for this division of the county, issued an address yesterday, offering himselffor reelection. In vindicating his vote with the Government and against his party on the Chinese question, he says:-
"1 On the occasion of the defeat of the Government, to which I have alluded, I supported Lord Palmerston. I did so on the ground, thaI, considering the difficuty and trying circumstauces Moglish officers and officials snay bo placed in on occasions requiring immediate dec. sion, It is dangesous and impeitic to create an impression on their part that, after acting as they coscilentioeusly considered the interests and honour of their coustry required, they mi4ht dad themselves without sufficient cause condemned, when without suffic'ent eTL dence they had been judged. I also supported Lord PAirncrton.
because, looking to the part he has taken duriog his Premiership, I consider he bas maintained the honour snd poaition of Englaad, and I was or opiuion that it was unfair, being insufficiently informed of the details, to pronounce, by an abstract resolution, a judgment on the conduct of the late evenUt in China."
DURHIANI COUNTY (SOUTH).-Mr. Farrer, the Conservative member for this division, has addressed the electors, offering himself again for the seat.
Essrlx (SOUTH).-Mr. ThomasWilliamBramston, for the sixth time, and after 22 years of publc service, again offers himself as a catididate for South Essex. The hon. gentleman in his address to his constituents observes that he has on several ocoacions, in critical times, given his support to Lord Palmerston's Government, especially on the Budget, and remarks on the Chinese question:-
" I was, after much consideration, led to the conviction that we bad been hurried unnecessarilyinto a warby theviolent and hastymneasures of our authsrity in charge of the national interests in China, and I felt myself bound to mark by my vote my sense of the injury which British interests had tbereby sustsianed; hut for this the Government were but remotely and contingently to blame, and had a motion been madS -as, under simiuar circumstances, has been frequently the case-of a want of confldence in Lord Palmerston's Administration I should, without hesltation, have opposed it."
The hon. gentleman concluded by hoping that, by a careful adaptation of expenditure to income, and by a rigid avoidance of all unnecessary expenses, the taxes may be reduced and the burdens of the people lightened.
EvmsnAhls.-Yesterday Sir Hugh Willoughby issued his address seeking re-election for this borough.
EXETER.-Sir J. T. B. Dackworth, the present Conservative member for this city, has just issued an address to the electors in which he announces his intention again to become a candidate, and, on the Chinese war, he says that he could not in his conscience declare that the violent measures resorted to at Canton were justified by the circumnstances of the case, and that in consequence he voted againstthe Government.
FS-SBnuBY.-Yesterday a meeting of the friends of Mr. Henry Beverley Wakeling was held at the Prince Albert Tavern, Bagnigge-wells-road, for the purpose of hearing his sentiments on the questions of the day. Mr. Wakeling stated that hewas in favour of vote by ballot and the extension of the suffrage, but was opposed to all religious endowments, and more especially that of the grant to Maynooth. He was a sincere advocate of Sir W. Clay's measure for the total and unconditional repealof church-rates. With regard to the admission of Jews to Parliament, he would give any such measure his hearty support. On the Chinese question he was prepared fully to support the Government, and would neversllow the English'dag, the emblem of English honour, to be insulted. From the promises of support he had already received he felt certain of being triumphantly returned, and he expressed his determination, if returned, to give his whole time, attention, and interest to the support of that borough, in which he had been a resident for the last 35 years. A resolution was passed in favour of Mr. Wakeling. Last evening a meeting of the friends of Mr. William Cox was held at the Crown Tavern, Clerkenwell-green, Mr. T. Parish in the chair, and the following resolution was agreed to:-
"T That this meeting, having heard with satisfaction Mr. Cowes ex. position of his political opinious, considers him a fit and proper person to represent the borough of Finabury, aud promises to support him on the day of election."
Last night a crowded meeting of the inhabitants of the borou'h of Finabury was held in the concert-room of the MyddTeton.hali, IJpper-street, Islington, for the purpose of hearing the political sentimente of Mr. Serjeant Parry, who seeks the representation of the borough; Mr. Robert Dent in the chair. Mr. Serjeant Parry having addressed the electors the following resolution was carried:
"Theat the meeting having heard from Ms. iesiesat Panrsa statement of his political principles, and having also regardto hbs coneietent public advocacy of those principles for many years past, deems him to he the right man to occupy a oeat in the repseseutation of the borough .
HASTLNos.-The -two old members, Mr. F. North and Mr. F. P. Pobertson, both of whom voted in favour o' the Government on the Chinese question, are not likely to be disturbed.
HIGIf WS COMBE.-There is no appearance of o position to the return of the two sitting members of this borough. Mr. Martin Tncker Smith has been canvasilng during the week, and Sir George Dashwood's address is hourly expected. Both gentlemen supported Lord Palmerston against Mr. Cobden's motion, and a strong opinion prevails in the town in favour of the noble Lord. A Conservative would not stand the slightest chance of being elected.
H0RSsIIAt-hlr. Scott, the deputy chairman of the London and Brighton Railway Company, has started for this borough, in opposition to M£r. Wt.R. S. Fitzgerald, who voted with the majority against Lord Palmerston's Government on the Chinese question.
HuocrN(lDOD;SrtIE.-The opposit-ion threatened to the retuirn of Messrs. Fehlowes and Rust has at last assumed an active form. MIr. J. M. Heatheote, of Conington Castle, has issued an address, and there is no doubt there will be a stirring contest.
OlnRHA1.snssr. Yesterdy hr. Boycott, the gentleh man who unsuior esfuhiy opposed the election of Mr. Lot e
on his appointment to the oCi e of Vice-President of the Board of Trade, issued an address to the electors of this borough placing his services at their disposaL. Mr. Lowe has concluded his canvass Of the electors.
Lstiri Sg R.-The conduct of the two sttting members (SIr J. Walimley and Mr. Bigga) in voting with the Minis rry on Mir. Cobden's msotionihas given great satisfaction in this town, and there is littly doubt of their re-eectio.r A meoting of Liberals from the various w lrds has adopted them as the candidates to be recommended to a ge.neral meeting of Liberal electors. A movement is on foot to bring out Mr. J. D EIarris, manufacturer, to oppcse Sir J. Walmsley, on account of the hon-gontleman'smotion on the

Ii. T. Baines at the ensuing election. Arter some nr6eiminary proceedings, a vote of thanks was passed to poir Georne Goodman, who rotires on account of v -ihealth. M.i Baines then addresso d the meeting, and met ith a most hearty reception. He ably defendedthe Government as to their conduct on the war in China, and his remarks were loudly applauded; The conduct of Lord Palmerston and the
Government on the Chinese question was approved by the meeting, and thefeelinz was altogetherin favour of returning members to the next Parliament who will support the noble Lord. There were two persons proposed for the choice of the meeting to be put in nomination as the Liberal candidates along with Mr. Baines-namely, Mr. F. Carbutt, a retired Leeds wool merchant, and Mr. W. E. Forster, a worsted manufacturer, carrying on business at Bradford, and living at Burley, near Otley. On their names being put to the meeting the majority was declared to be in favour of Mr. Forster. Mr. Carbutt said he should take time to consider what course he should pursue, and plice himself in the hands of his friends. Air. Foster did not give a positive promise that he would become a candidate, but sid he would do nothing to divide the Liberal party, so that, in point of fact, neither Mr. Carbutt nor Mr. Forster agreed to becomeacandidate. The meeting did notiseparate till halfpast 11 o'clock.
Lwxvzs.-The Hon. H. Fitzroy and the Hon. H, Brand, supporters of thle GBovernment, are pretty safe in this borough; but it appears they are not to walk over the course, Sir Charles Blunt, a Conservative, being in the field - but there is very little doubt of the return of the two old
LmscoLrsmsu.-Lord Burghley retires from the re
sentation of South Lincolnshire, having been solicited to stand for North Northamptonsbire. It is said to be the intention of the electors in the eastern part of the division to invite Mr. Cardwell to come forward as a candidate. Mr. Cardwell has within the past few years become an extensive proprietor in that part of the diviion.
M.L-roN.-The Hon. C. W. W. Fitzwilliam and Mr. J. E. Denison are expected to be re-elected for this borough without opposition.
NEWARK}.-The town is placarded with bills announcing that a third candidate, advocating " progressive" ywi, wisl soon Qifer himself, and asking t1t elqctors noti. :m poine

NORTALLEPTON.-No opposition is expected to the re-election of M1r. W. B. Wrightson for this borough.
NOnRTZArnPrO~Vq~ consequence of Mfr.

"1That this meeting has beard with mingled feelings of pleasure and regret that the idberal electors ot the city of London have requested our loEg-tried and faithful representative, Mr. Raikos Currie. to bW comne a candidate for that important conatituency, andiwbile lamenting thefprobability of losing his valuable services as a memwer for this borough, anudtendering our sincere acknowledgmeuts of the tindepeindence, integrity, and high ability whichhbeha3 exhibited in oureservice during a period of 20 reams, we cannoet but admit the tect that so distinguished a tribute to his high qualities folly justifies him in puttinig himself at the disposal of the city electors, if such shall be his determi nation."
NORTA. RtNr (SouTrs). -The Ron. H. G. Lidldell and Mr. W. B. Beaumont, the mnerabers for this dlivision, issued their addresses yesterday. Mr. Beaumont says :
" This year I cordially supported the Government on the Chinese question. The technical issue was whether the English authorities in Canton were Justified in their proceedings with reference to the lorcha Arrow. The question of law I shall not hero dircusi. Mlost thinking men probably regret that the Mriis plenipotentiary did bot apply to the home Government for instructions before sesrtiug to extrersities This course, howiver, once taken, Her Majesty's advisers had no alternative hut to sanction mneasures intended to protect tiba honour of England and, ultimately, the lives and the property of Ecrglilelsubjects. I hope anidbelieve that our opponent4s,.placedin the same eircusitances would have scted in the same manner. The seal Isse was wro should govern the country.

Peace,under Lord Palmeroton's auspices, has beeanmade with Perasi: aud if he is backed by the eon5dence of the people he will find a satlafatory solution of the Chinese difficulty -a difficulIty which he did not originate. W'ith the best intentions the Oppxiitlon wrould not be in favourable circumstance:s for settling he question. They have declared the nation In the wrong, and, in stead, therefore, of placing our comrmerce with ChIna on a fair and permanent fooling, they w oninL hays to make large concessions, ini order to re-establish peace" There is no opposition.
NoftwicH.-The Liberal party held their first public meetinig on Thursday evening at the Royal Hotel, for the puroose ofB hearin a statement of their opinions from
isount Bury an9 Mr. H1. W'. Schneider, the Ministerial candidates for the representation of the city. Mtr. E. Willett presided over the meeting, which was numerously attendled. Both gentlemen, having addressed the mreeting, were accepted as the candidates of the Liberal party. Mi. TMlett saild he was extremely sorry that the honest and conscientious vote of 'Mr. Warner, the present Liberal member, on the Chinese question had separated from the Liberals of Norwich one of the most truthful, patrotic, and amiable mnen that ever enteredl the city. It had been his painful duLty to advise Mx. Warner to retire, that he maight be saved from the humiliation of defeat. [Mfr. Warner, it will be remembered, votedawith the majority in the division on Mr. Cobden's miotion.] The meeting closed with three hearty cheers for Lord Palnerston. The Conservative party also held another meeting on Thursday evening at the Norfolk Hotel, and Sir Samuel Bignold delivered another addres. No second Conservative candidate has yet, however, appeared. The e-citement itt Norwich increases5 and there is every probability of a severe contest.
'Nonrs (NostTHs).-There is a rumour that Lord H. Ben tinok- will not again offer himself, and a requisition is being got up to Mr. J. E. Denison, the present maember for Malton, requesting him to come forward.

"f I ama honoured by being elected by youn I shall hold mysaelf hound by iRo party In the country and sihall always support that Ministry and those measures which I may think- the best. At the name time, and particularly under present circuometancos, I have no hesitation in stating that I should support the Government of Lord Palmeraton, as since it has been in power it hLas alwaya uphtld the honour of our country abroad, and has born inclined to support mode rate and good measures at home."
Major-General Buckley offers himself for re-election.
Sou7TnAmTo,TO.-Thereconciliation oftheLiberal party in this borough may now be considereil as completely effected. A large and influential meeting, convened by circular, comprising some 200 of the leading members of the two sections of the Liberals, which were arrayed against each other at the late election, was held on Wednmesday evening at the PolyteoLnmc Institution, Mr. Edward Dixon in the chair. The feeling, in favour of the sitting mnembers, Messrs. W lco and Weguelin, was of the most cordial andl unitedl character. Several resolutio-ns, which -were moved and seconded alternately by gentlemen belonging to the two sections above referred to, were adopted unanimously, pledging the sup pDrt of the Liberals to Mlessrs. Willcox and Weguelin, and the whole meeting formedi themselves into a commaittee to conduct their election. Admiral Sir Henry Prescott was invited to act as chairmnan; Mr. Alderman Dusautoy and M1r. W. Lank-ester (the respective chairmen of Messr. R. Andrews and Weguelin's late comimittees.), as vice-chairmen; and Mr. Alderman Blatch and Mr. A. Pegler as hon. secretaries, All these gentlemnen have anceded to tbe request, with one exception, and ho is to give his final answer, which it is anticipated will be in the affirmative, on Saturday morning. This fusion of the Liberal party and sink-ing of all their late differences will doubtless secure the unopposed re-election of the present representatives of the borough. A, pblic meeting of the electors is to be held as early as po bIs to meet thos two gentlemen. The Tories have withdrawn the petition lately presented against Mr. Wepuelin.
TEwKEsBuRty.-Mr. Humphrey Brown h%3 issued an address to the electors, offering himself for re-election on Liberal principles, and as a anp~orter of Lord Palmerston's Government. His connexion with the Royal British Bunk-,
however, has affected his position here ; but M1r. Brown denounces the cry raised against him as un-Englishi and unfair. Mr. MLartin, the other sitting mnember, also renews the offer of his services. Be, too, is a supporter of the Governmient. A third candidate has ap peured in the person of the Hon. F. Lygon, son of Earl Jieaucbamp, who has been inivited to stand for the borough. Mr. L~ygon accepts the invitation.
TIVERToN.-An opposition is thTeatenea at Tiverton b
M1r. J. Heron Maxwell, a Conservative, who says in his address:-
"Lord Palmeroton has considered It his duty to appeal to the constituencies of the country fo- a vote of confidence In him, and a reversal of the vote of csusure which, by a majority of the Hoorse of Commons (including the leading statesmen of every political sec-tioni. wasa lately poassed upon his Government. It will ho foryou. gentlemern, to show by your voles on the day of election whether you approve the conduct of Lord Palmermtorn and his Cabinet; or whether, by returning me as your representative, you convey a condemnation of his policy in China, and of the policy of Sir John Bowering, which mainly hie brought about the deplorable events now occurring in that country. The immediate consetruences of these unbappy hostilities- in China are an increase in the dutyon tea, and therfstasl toreducee the incometax to the sisandard fixed In 1813 The remote consequence of such

IRELAND.
There is a probability of a sharp contest for the borou h of Uarrickfergus. The candidates are Mr. F. Mlacdonoug, Q.C., chief of Irish niiprivs lawyers, who stands as a propessive Conservative or Peelite; Mr. Conway Vobbs
Derbyie-aD Lieutenant-Colonel Frederick Ferguson, who iu a brief address, dated from Paris, merely asnouuces his intention to seek the suffrages of the electors, without making the remotest allusion to the party and leaders under whose banners he sueans to range himself. Mr. J. J. Richardson retires from the representation of Lisburn. This gentleman is the first Quaker ever sent to Parliament by an Irish constituency. Mr. Peel Dawson and Mr. Clark, by their friends and agents, are busily engaged in a canvass of the electors of Uondonderry county. Mr. Greer, the tenant-right champion, who the other daysufferedso signala defeat,will hardly run the chances of another failure. Neither, it is said, will Sir Hervey Bruce, the Derbyite, redeem his promise to come forward at the general election. A local parer says that a wet blanket seems to haTe been throvin over the worthy baronet by his brother Tories, but that, under any circumstances, the Liberal party * are sure to make their appearance at the proper time' with augmented po ler." All this sounds very welU on paper, but the said Liberal party have not the most remote chance of opening the representation of Derry for at least another generation. There are some vague rumours to-day touching the probability of a Liberal candidate being started for the Irish metropolis, but from the state of the regstry it is believed that the attempt to disturb either Mr. Grogan or Mr. Vance would be altogether fruitless. Apathy and want of organization on the part of their opponents have given the Conservatives a long lease of the citg of Dublin. Major M'Clintook (COn. servative) and Mr. a. . Belew (Whig) are feeling the pulse of the electors of Louth. The latter, notwithstanding hiis unpopularity wlhile holding offlice as a Lord of the Treasury, is said to be recoveriRg lost ground, and that he can reckon upon the support of one of the most influential of Mr. Kennedy's supporters among the Roman Cathohc clergy. In the borough of Dundalk it is stated that the majority of the constituency are combined in favour of Mr. Powyer, owing to that gentleman's superzealous devotion to the interests of the R,man Church.
TIrPERARY.-(By Electric Telegraph).-At the close of the poll on Friday the O'Donoghue had a gross majority of 729 over Mr. Waldron.

A Glasgow Sheriff On The Liberty Of The Press.
A GLASGOW SHERrFF OX THB LIBERTY OF
THE PRESS. I
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I have seen a letter in The Timre of Tuesday, signed by the defendant's agent in causn " Scotland v. Gunn," in which the writor says that the article upon the liberty of the press in Glasgow seems to bave been " written under a complete misapprehension of the actual circumstances of the case." The article referred to appeared in the first instance in the Scotsman, in which it was inserted without the desire or intervention of any one connected with the Gasgow Herald; but, as I happen to have figured in the case, alike prominently and unwillingly, and should therefore know something about it, I hog to say the Scotsman's article contains facts, and nothing but facts.
A very brief explanation will, I trust, make this appatent. On the 4th of June last a statement appeared in the Glasgow Hcrald to the effect that a boy named Robert Scotland, in the employment of Mr. W. L. Gunn, brassfonnder, had been apprehended on the charge of plundering his employer. In the same paper of the 6th current a paragraph appeared to the effect that the boy had been summarily tried before Sheriff Steele, that it appeared from the evidence that " no thoftuons intention was manifest in his conduct, but that, on the contrary, he had been placed in a false position by his sudden apprehension in a trap laid for him by Mr. Gunn." The boy was accordingly acquitted, and the Sheriff animadverted on tho " conduct of his employer in baiting a trap into which even the most innocent might inadvertently fall." The information contained in this paragraph, I may state, was privately communicated by a correspondent, as it is not customary for professional reporters to attend the court in question. On the 9th of June a long letter was inserted in the Herald as an advertisement by Mr. Gunn. Inthis letter he does not question tho accuracy of a single word that appeared in the Herald as to the res gestc of the trial, but proceeds by a train of reasoning to show that, though the boy was acquitted, he should be considered guilty after al. I enclose these three articles that you may Judge of them for yourself.
The next move occurred towards the close of the year, when I and other gentlemen connected with tho Hcrald were summoned to give evidenco before Sheriff Steele in a civil cause of which we had never heard; for it would appear that in the meantime an action had been raised by the boy Scotland, with consent and concurrence of his father, against Gunn, grounded, as I have heard, upon statements which had appeared in this advertisement. I attended, and, on being sworn %nd interrogated, stated that the facts in the paragraph of the 6th of June had been snpplied by a private correspondent, I was ordered to tel tho name, bat this I respectfully declined to do, in accordance with the invariable rule of the establishment in such cases. No explanation whatever was made to me as to the reasons why the name was asked; my memory was not refreshed as to the identity of Scotland and Gunn; nor was I then told, nor do I yet know, what is the actual matter of dispute between them. It might be " idle curiosity" for anything I knew to the contrary. The agent merely dealt with me according to the principle of " Stand and doliver; name your informant." I declined to do so, as I have said, upon which 31r. Sheriff Steele granted a warrant for my imprisonment, but it was not carried into effect, and the case was adjourned.
This occurred on the 29th of December, and shortly thereafter I was ordered to attend again on the 18th of February under penalty of being apprehended if I refused Mr. Pagan, under whose directions I act in this office, was ordered to attend on the same conditions. The proceedings at that diet have been already correctly narrated in the Scotsman, and thence transferred to your colmnms. It will be seen that a second warrant was granted by Sheriff Steele for my imnprisonrnent. The agent says that ample time was allowed to the gentlemen of the Herald for " consideration and consultation." This is quite true. But it does not follow that although six months had been allowed, instead of six weeks, the He-rald gentlemen were, on that account, to submit to what they regarded as an impertinent attempt to lay open the private details of their business. In a letter in anotherjournal, to which you are referred by the agent, he says that the parties connected with the Herald were "offered the opportunity of taking eminent legal advice if they thouglht fit before any warrant for contempt should be granted." The Herald dia take legal advice. It was advised that Sheriff Steele's interpretation of the lawr was unsound, and ought to be resisted. We were accordingly prepared to go to prison on the sheriff's warrant, so that the case might be trned in the Suprme Court on a Bill of Suspension and Liberation. A compromnise was offered, howrever, at the last moment, by which the name was obtained through the voluntary admission of our private correspondent himself, and thus the case terminated-leaving it still unsettled whether or not ¶' this is" {as alleged by the agent) "strictlya matter of evidence which every good citizen is bound to give."
I am. Sir. vour obedient servAnt.

To The Editor Of The Times.
I lTO TIE EDITOR OF THE VAMES.
Sir,-Protected by the privileges of PaTliassent, and profiting by the favourable opportu)1ty of"stabbing in the back" a man 10,000 miles sWay from his native land, and therefore unable to raiaw his voice in self-defence for, many months to comere certain " noble" lords and " right honourabIe'. and " honourable' gentlemen have thought it consistent with their position as British legislators and men of honour to lay to the charge of Sir John Bowring during the recent debates irt both Houses of Parliament, without circunmlocution, * and in so many words, the heaviest crime that can be alleged against a man in his relationc towards society,-that of " wilful and deliberate falsehood," in consequence of a pretended discrepancy between two letters addressed to Cousul Parkes and Commissioner Yeh respectively, in the first of which he stated that " the Arrow had no right to hoist the British flag," while in the second he observed that " there is no doubt that the lorcha Arrow lawfiully bore the British flag underaregister granted by him."
That there may be no mistake as to the language used in reference to this subject, I will cite the very words employed by some of the speakers, as reported in your columns. A youthful Earl stigmatized " the falseness and perfidy" of the transaction; a recalled Governor-General of India wondered that " Her Majesty could permit any man to remain in her service who could state the thing he believed not to be true ;" the member for Enniskillen said that Sir J. Bowring had been guilty of " equivocation, falsehood, evasion, misrepresentation ;" a late First Lord of the Admiralty stated that he had " advisedly and knowingly practised a deliberate deception upon the Chinese Government ;" a late Colonial Secretary charged him with " falsehood, or the most barefaced contradictions ;" an expectant Chief Justice accused him of " direct falsehood ;" and & former President of the Board of Trade employed the phrases of " liar" and " wilful and deliberate falsehood." These extracts are perhaps sufficient.
So great was the importance attached to making good this cruel charge that some of the above speakers actually made it after the news of the wicked attempt to murder Sir J. Bowring and his family by poison had become publicly known, and while it was quite uncertain whether their lives wou.l be saved.
As Sir John Bowring's nearest relative, and as his representative in this couutry during his absence in China, I could not hear these charges advanced without the greatest pain and the greatest amazement, feeling tbat, if true, he would be unworthy to hold his Sovereign's commission. Those expe rienced in Parliamentary tactics told me, indeed, that these accusations were put forward mainly to influence votes in the division, and not from any irrepressible horror of "falsehood ;" andthat they are also intended to be turned into capital at the forthcoming general election is shown by the address just issued by a right hon. member for Portsmouth whovoted against the Government, and who deliberately repeats the gross charge of falsehood now that theheat and passion of the debate have passed away.
I do not now address you, Sir, to deny the fact that Sir John Bowring actually employed the two phrases upon which these heavy accuations are based, as he undoubtedly did employ them; but I write to protest indignantly and emphatically on his behalf against the unjust and ungenerous inferences drawn from them, and I trust to be able to showyour readers in avery fewwords how grosslyand how cruelly two simple sentences, each equally correct, have, for party purposes, been twisted from their plain and obvious meaning, to convey a sense never for one moment intended by their writer.
On turning to the blue-book from which these passages were taken I was immediately struck by the fact that the two letters containing them were written at an interval of five weeks from each other, and that 79 ponderous pages of correspondence intervened between them. But on looking at the documents to wchich these letters wer7c tle reply the apparent discrepancy between them was instantly explained, and the utter injustice of Sir T. Bowring's accusers displayed in their placingin juxtaposition what I cannot but call garbled extracts of despatches, inasmuch as a knowledge of the circumstances under which they were written is indispensable to understanding them properly. I leave your readers to judge of the fairness of those who could wilfully suppress half the truth and take advantage of Sir J. Bowring's absence to advance allegations of falsehood against him, which, if present, he would have instantly and triumphantly refuted. Surely, the honour of England is falling low, when her so-called statesmen thus condescend
In vriting his first letter to Consul Parkes on the 11th of October, Sir J. Bowring acquainted him that, having failed to comply with a certain provision of our colonial law, " the Arrow had no right to hoist the British flag." But, after showing that this was the csse under our municipal regulations-that is to say, that ars betceett ottrselves and the vesse, she had lost by a very few days her claim to insist on our protection (though the fact of her having, without opposition on the part of the Chinese authorities, deposited her papers with the British Consul after her register had expired proved conclusively that she was still a British vessel in every sense of the word), the Plenipotentiary proceeded to show that, as between ourselves anl the Chinese, this technical flaw in the register made no difference whatever, and that the Arrow, by treaty and international law, as distinguished from municipal law, remained a British vessel to all intents and purposes within the broad meaning of the treaty with China, which was all he had to consider.
Since the close of the debate I have ascertained that the Arrow is well known in China as a regularBritish trader, and that the expiration of the license in her case is by no means a singular one, as such expiration cannot be avoided in many instances, when the vessel happens to be absent at the timne from the waters of Hongkong. But the rule in sulch cases is to renew the register as a matter of course when she returns there, the master being merely reprimanded for liis carelessness when necessary.
But what as respects Sir J. Bowring's second letter-that to Commissioner Yeh of the 14th of November? Why, it is specifically stated to be a reply to Yeh's letter of the 12th of that month, in which he stated that " the lorcha was built by a Chinese; a register was purchased for her of the merchant Block for $1,000, and she assumed the British flag without being entitled to it;" or (as translated more accurately in the note, as proved by a subsequent letter of Yeh) "assumed the flag fraudulently." Here is clearly a general, sweeping assertion that the circumstances speci6ed by him rendered the use of the British flag fraudulent, andthatthevessel, in her general character, was Chinese, and not British. In specific refutation of this broad and untrue statement, Sir John Bowring made that equally broad but true reply which is. now so fiercely attackcd-viz, that "the Arrow lawfully bore the British flag under a register granted by him." In other words, while Yeh stated that the vessel assumed and therefore bore the, flag fraudulently, Sir J. BowiDg rejoined that she, did not, but on the contrary bore it lawfitdy. And this is the wilful and deliberate falsehoodclcharged against the latter !
The further rejoinder of Yeh, dated November17, proves conclusively that the dissusaion had reference to the general character of the_ Arrow, and not to her accidental and technical position at the. moment of the outrage, for ho repeats almost verbe im his former statement as to theopurchase of the register, and adds that " she fraudulentlyv assumed the flag of your nation>."
I believe, Sir that your readers will deem the foregoing plain staiement of facts conclusive eyidence of the falseness of the charges advanced against Sir J. Bowring; but,in any casJ. I have, already written urgently to kim to give Bis own explanation in his own words, ana i now pledge myself, on his behalf, that at the eariest possib6 momenta full and completeanswer shilbe givenbr him to thesesl3nderousaccusations, zkouNIMs healbk be preserved, and he have eaped the hand of tihe
poisoner and assassn dircted igainist him at ]Qaigr kong, and not sink under the effects of the insidiou. poison sent him from home.
Sir, I maenoappealforgeneritytotav. Si3r0 Bowringi btrt onty for the simplest, seantiest justice; am I have such confidence in that spirit of justice and. fairplay which is inherent in the cta ,

rAJUI. hARers 12, 6 P.M.
The Prussian Ministr bhas received no instructions from Berlin since Saturday last when he transmitted the conditions communicated by the Conference for the settlement of the Neuch&tel question. This delay is felt to be very annoying, and the Emperor, who treated the Swiss in so unceremonious a manner to please the King of Prussia and with the pros.. pect of a visit from his Royal brother, now fiiids what sort of a friend he has paid court to, and how little worth'while it was to wound the feelings of old and tried friends to flatter those whose good will he can never expect to gain. The Emperor is said to be irritated at the manner in which the Prassian Government is acting. He imprudently engaged himself with the Swiss, and his exgagement is now as far from fulfilment as ever. But for that engagement the prisoners would not have been liberated, and the French Government is, In reality, responsible for the dilatoriness if not bad faith of their friend, who, I dare say, laughs at the simplicity of those who trusted him. So far as the Swiss are concerned it matters not much to them. The sovereignty of the King of Prussia in NeuchMtel is at an end; that the King, will "mobilize" another army against Switzerland is not probable, and it is still more improbable that even if it were mobilized Elis MIajesty would make use of it. No day is yet fixed for the resumptien of the Conferences.
It does not appear that Prince Daniel of Montenegro meets with much encouragement in his suit for complete independence. The suzerainetM, however shadowy, claimed by the Porte will not, it seems, be renounced; and it is not likely that the Alies will use any pressure in this matter on the Sultan, to preserve the integrity of whose empire they made war. The Porte would not, perhaps, be unwilling to grant a certain portion of territory in the Herzegovina for agricultural purposes to the Montenegrins, or to allow them a port on the Adriatic, but independence will not be listened to at Constantinople, nor, probably, in Paris.
The Patr-e of this evening states that accounts from the frontiers of China received at St. Petersburg, and published by the Jodwn de 1XAcadamie, announce that the Government of Pekin is in a state of dissolution, that the Emperor has no cash, and is forced to issue iron coin, that aU the moneyed men had left the city, and that the Chinese and Mantchoos are in open hostility.
It is again affirmed that during the sbort period of hostilities between Great Britain and Persia the Russian Government obtained permission from the Court of Teheran to establish military posts and blockhouses in the passes of Bayazid, in order to secure the possession of the road by Mount Ararat.
Feruk Khan, the Persian Ambassador, had yesterday a long conference with theAmericanMinister in Paris.
Intelligence has been received from Mexico that President Comonfort has signed a treatygranting to an American company considerable advantages on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, in the province of Oaxaca.
M. de Olaguibel, the Mexican Minister in Paris, had a long conference this morning with Count Walewslki, Minister for Foreign Affairs. It is said that the Mexican Government, perceiving that serious events are impending, has requested the good offices of Great Britain and France to arrange the differences with Spain.
The folowing private telegraphic despatch has been received:
* MARSEILLES, M-ARcH 12.
'Nerimnon Khan and Mirza Ebel Khan, bearing the treaty signed at Paris by Feruk Kban, left this morning for Constantinople.
II The Circassians had, it was said, beaten the Russians on the banks of the Laba. The Russians had re-crossed that river, leaving behind them 400 men, four pieces of cannon, and a portion of their baggage. A Russian oorps had been received at Tabriz with enthusiasm.
"The Persian army which was to operate against the Affghans had, it was asserted, been reinforced, and the Russians were endeavounring to occupy tho Khanat of Kokan, in order to extend their frontiers to the English possessions. The Sovereign of Bokhara, alarmed at these plans of Russian invasion, was soliciting the Sultan to cause the independence of Kokan to be respected."
A letter from Naples of the 5th inst. mentions a political hoax played off in that city on the occasion of the Queen giving birth to a son. The trick, which created much sensation in the city, is supposed to be the work of some of the secret societies. The following proclamation, having the Royal arms at its head, and at the bottom the signature of the Imperial printer, was posted at the corners of several streets:-
"- Ferdinand IL, by the grace of God King of the Two Sicilies, of Jerusalem, &c., Duke of Parma, Piacenza, Castro, &c., Hereditary Grand Prince of Tuscany, &c.- Providence having deigned to increase our IRoyal family by another son, adhering to the friendly councils of the British and French Governments, and desiring, as formerly, to indulge the movements of our paternal heart, we have resolved to command, and we do command, as follows:-
" Art. 1. We grant a full amnesty to all political prisoners, tried or not tried.
" Art. 2. We restore to vigour the Constitution of the 10th February, 1848, to which we swore faith on the Gospels.
"Art. 3. Our well-beloved son, the Hereditary Prince, is appointed Vicar-General of the kingdom.
Art. 4. The Chambers, which have been closed, shall be Immediately convoked.
" IAArt. 5. The Minister Secretary of State, President of the Council of Ministers, is charged with the eoecution of the present decree.
"FERDINAND.
FERDINAND TROJA, Mnister Secretary of State, President of the Council of Ministers. "Caserta, Feb. 28,1857."
It would not be easy to describe the fright of the police when they discovered these proclamations. The text of the Imperial decree was so ingeniously pasted over a genuine proclamation as to leave the top and bottom visible, and thus give it all the appearance of authenticity. In other respects the political condition of the country remains the same. The police have organized a system of terror and oppression which cannot be surpassed anywhere.
The Silcie contains the following interesting sta. tiBtics relative to the progress of cattle-breedig in France and England:-
"In both countries an equal number of sheep is bred; this number is about 35,000,000 head. The 35,000,000 In the united kingdom live on 31,000,000 hectares (2.1 acres), while the 35,000,000 in France Live on 53,000,000 hectares. It therefore results that on an equal extent of territory the English breed two sheep where we only breed one. This Is not the sole difference. In many of our departments the production of fine wool has been encouraged to the detriment of the production of meat. The English have sont their fine merinos to Australia, where they prosper admi. rably, and their whole attention is devoted to the produc. tion of meat. It thence result3 that the 35,000,000 French sheep produce annually 60,000,000 lilogrammes (21b.) of wool, and 144,000.000 kdlogrammes of meat; while the 35,000,000 English sheep produoe annually 60,000,000 kilo. grammes of wool, and 360,000,000 klogrammes of meat. The proportion of mutton produced in France and England exists in the very disproportionate figures of 360 to 144. And in these figures we have compared France with the British isles, thus comprising the hlly regions and moors of Scotland, as, likewise, the poorer districts of Ireland. Were we to confine ourselves to Enugland proper the contrast would be [even greater. England breeds two sheep per hectare against two-thirds of a sheep bred by France; the prodace of an English sheep is more than double that of a French one. So much for the ovine raceIn E:ngland the censumnption of milk is considerable, and
cheese forms an importat article of food. The county
of Cheshire alone supplies cheese of the annual value of 1,000,0001. sterling. ik is sold dearer In England tha in France. Our cow. produce
1,000,000,000 litres of m ,lk, which is sold at an average price of L0c. the litre; the English oows produce
double the quantity, which is sold at double the price-
consequently the English agriculturists derive a profit four times larger than the French farmers. The English breed 8,000,000 head of cattle on 31,000,000 hectas; the French
bree 10,000,000 On 53,000,000 hectares. Therefore the English, oa an equal surface given, possess more eattle than the French. The butchers' trade of France slughters
uannuIly 4,000,000 head of cattle, which produce
500,o 00,00o kilogrmmes (21b.) of maeat. The English saughter aWanlly 2,000,000 head, and yet obtain
above a q r more m eatthan th the French. Whence ptoeds this inneae difference ? XIn England very little fea. eaten; ft ia not considered as meat in
pr4ftioaa to be slaughtered, and the famers are aethat hitilling a calf a sourc o f capita Iis destroyed. Iu Frce out of 4,000,000 head of attl lu Atred
calves figure for 2,500,000. Veal is a poor article of food, but wo do not poesess sufficient forage to allow our calves to ech their maturity. In England oxen never work in the fields, and they attain considerable fatness. In France cattle are slaughtered after several years' labour; they are fatigued, Cexhausted, and afford relatively a scanty supply of meat. It will be sid that our cattle give in labour what they lose in flesh, but the compensation is not equal, as the foUowing table shows
"Fr enh cattle give annually-
In milk ... ... ... ... 100,000,000f. In meat ... ... ... .. 400,000,000 In labour ... ... ... .. 200,000,000
Total ... ... 700,000,000f. "The cattle of England give each year-
In milk ... ... ... ... 400000000f In meat ... ... .- ... 5000,000 In labour... ... ... ... ... ...
Total ... ... 900,000,00M.
"A cow in England produces, therefore, moro by its milk and meat than the same animal in France by its milk, meat, and labour."

AUSTRIA.
(FROM oUR OWN CORRESPONDBNT.)
VIENNA, 1ARCIO 10.
As it may interest the British public to learn what impression the recent policy of the leaders of the Opposition in the IHouse of Commons has made in Austria, I subjoin a summary of an article which is contained in the principal independent organ of the Vienna press. The Presse thus writes:-
" Now that we have before us the whole of the debate in the Lower House on the Chinese question, we see that the greatest British statesman of the day has met with a slight check at the hands of Mr. Cobden, who obtained the immoral support of the Tories and Peelites. The word 'war' evidently drives Mr. Cobden-who is unable to take a clear statesmanlike view of any great politicd question -to despair. During the late war he was a partisan of Russia, and now he sympathizes with the sanguinary Mandarin Yeh, and denounces the British Government because it vwould rather punish the Chinese barbarians according to their deserts than place the honour of England and the lives and property of British subjeots in the hands of the bloodthirsty Chinese authorities. If the Earl of Derby and his followers were to get possession of the reins of government they would be obliged to act as Lord Palmerston is now doing. Their hostility to the Premier, however, was so great, that they condescended to conclude a temporary alliance with Mr. Cobden, and by so doing succeeded in obtaining a temporary majority. What mnst have been the feelngs of the parties to such a miserable party manoeuvre, when they a few hours latersaw in the publicopapers detailed accounts of the fearful atrocities committed by the Chinese, and read the declasation of war which the Emperor of China, at the instigation of Russia, launched against the other Eursopean States ? Al-
though it is a mnatter in which we are not immediately con-| cerned, we cannot but feel that it wrill be most disastrous for England if her poicy in Aa, where Rusia is making such prodigious progress, should be other than it now is."
In a former letter a passage relative to the right of Russia to appoint consuls or commercial agents in any part of the dominions of the Shah of Persia was quoted from Article 10 of the treaty of Turkmantchai, and a person who is an excellent authority on such matters informs me that England will enjoy the same privilege, if the new treaty places her on a level with the nations " most favoured" by the Peraian Government. Now Balfrasch, or Balfurusch, which is about 30 miles from the Caspian, in the province of Mazanderan, is the largest and most thriving commercial city in Persia, and one of the first steps taken by Her Majestys Government after peace is definitively concluded should be to send an agent to protect the British subjects whose comrnercial pursuits may lead them to the place in question. Balfirsch has several spacious bazaar, 10 large crazvanserais, and a population of more than 200,000 souls. It may be observed that aU the Russian commercial agents in the East are men who are capable of writing a political despatch as well as many men of much higher rank and standing.
More than one of the members of the Austrian Cabinet is a friend to the liberty of the press, but there is a party in the State which would wilingly suppress every one of its organs excepting the official papers and those published by the agents of Rome. The Jesuitical YoGuksreumd to-day aunounces the condemnation and proscription of Dr. Gunther's works by the " Congregation of the Index," but, instead of giving an opinion as to the justice of the sentence, it says, " Roma locuta, causafinitac."
The Austrian troops began their march from Jassy on February 26, and on the 3d instant the last company of the infantry regiment " Archduke Joseph" had quitted the Moldavian capital. The infantry, which marched to Galatz, is to come up the Danube in steamers. The cavalry will cross the frontier into Transylvania.
According to the Kalisch correspondent of the Oesterreichische Zeitung, the Russians are maldig prodigious preparations for their intended expedition against the Caucasian tribes.
On the 27th of February His Majesty granted a general amnesty to all those soldiers, from the sergeant downwards, who in 1848 and 1849 deserted from the Italian army.

The Privileges Of The Guards.
THE PPlVILEGES OF THE GUARDS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Entirely concurring in the views of your corre. apondent " In Transltu," who points out in Tne Times of to-day the injustice and inexpediency of hurrying off the 23d to China before the wounds inflicted on that gallant corpsintheRussianwarare well slinned over, I beg to ask why the Guards are not to bear their share in such difficult and dangerous duty? From the peculiar advantages which the Guards enjoy in peace as well as in war, they ought to be, and I believe are, as fit as any body of men in Her Majesty's service to undertake it. It has always been their stock argument, when attempting to justify the monopoly of promotion and the exeamption from bIdian and colonial service which are conceded to them, that whenever real fighting is imminent in any part of the world. save in our colonial and Indian possessions, the Guards constitute a perfect body of first-rate officers and men, whose proud privilege it is to claim precedence of employ. ment wherever danger is to be faced and honour won.
Now, here is a case in point. We are at war with China-a nation difficult to cope with from its distant position, its populousness, its climate, and its crml and fierce disregard of the usages of war. It can only be reached by troope from England after a voyage of between three and four months; they must reach it too at a most unhealthy season of the year, when the rice-grounds ae dry and sun-strokes and fevers imminent and deadly.
If we send thither the young 23d and other regimentg similarly circumatanced, the mortality among them will be horrible; if we send thither the Guards, who must be much better fitted from obvious circumstances for auch a trial, their sufferings, though inevitably great, will be certainly less.
At any ste, if the latter are to escape taldng their fair ahare of rach a aerious service M te war in Chin, it is but reaonable that their less fortunate brethren of the Line should "know the rson whv."

The Representation Of The City.
TR1EPRESENTATION OP THE ITY.
Yesterday afternoon the meeting of the merchants, bankers, traders, and electors of the city of London, convened by the Lord Mayor, to consider the decision recently come to by the House of Commons, and to express its high confidence in Her Majestya Government, was held in the Guildhall. Two o'clock was the hour fixed for taking the chair, but long before that time the body of the halt was filed, and at the upper end ,the throng was so densely packed that it was impo8sible to approach the hustings. The police seemed to have exercised but a weak discretion as to those at first admitted, for at least from 150 to 200 of those nearestthe platform were not only not electors of the city, but evidently only attended to obstruct and embarrasi the proceedings. In some respects their efforts were successfal, at least as regards interrapting the varion, speakers; but of course their noisy exclamation4 had no effect upon the resolutions come to by a meetin; in which, apparently, the supporters of Lord Palmersto; wrer at least 80 per cent, of the entire number. Beforo ti.e chair was taken the minority we have alluded to occapied themselveswith chanting somewords tothetuneofthe "3Mar sellaise," and were so gratified at the success of their vocal efforts (which, echoing through the lofty hall, really hada good effect) that "Cheerboys cheer," " uleBritanuna," anl various other popular nd patriotic ditties succeeded eac.
other in deafening and rapid succession, and were not close I until the Lord Mayor took the chair at 2 o'clock.
Among those on the platform we noticad Mr. Raikes Currie, M.P., Sir Ji. Duke, MLP., Sir F. G. Moon, Mr. B. Oliveira, P.M. Aldermen oLse and Wire, Sheridf Keats and Mechi, Er. R. W. Crawfurd, Mr. J. Dillon, hli. Edwin James, Q.C., Mr. Serjeant Ballantine, Messrs. Wentvworth DIke, S. Morley, J. Pileher, IL C. Whitehnrst, Dakin, T. Parker, E. Ball, H. Lloyd, "C
The LOiD MAYOR opened the proceedings by stating that he had felt it his duty to call them together in consequence of a requisition whioh he had received, signed by upwards of 800 of the merchants, bankers, and tradesmen of the city, asking him to convene a public meeting, in order that they might express their opinion at the present crisis upon the conduct of Her Majesty's Ministers (Cheers.) It was not for him to make any remarks upon the subject, but he had felt it his duty, when called upon to p dresd at a meeting like the present, at once to accede to the request-a coarso which he should invariably follow, whatever the object for which the meeting might be summoned. He knew that differences of opinion must always exist, but the only way to arrive at a right decision was to hear all aides, and he therefore solicited a patient hearing for every one who might come forward to address them. ('heers.)
Mr R.ATES CUBRE, X.P. for Northampton, ene of the newly-proposed candidates for the city, then presented himself to move the first resolution, and he was received with them nled cheers and hisses, usual on such occasions. Often as they had met together he said, in that their ancient hall, he believed that they haa seldom asenmbled upon an occasion with which the best interests of the country were more intimately bound up than on the present; for, as he took it, they had met, not to glorify any man or any Mlinster, however able or however successful ne might be Out he apprehended theat teRreat question which was tooe proposed to the sound un erstanding and practical common sense of his fellow-citizens was this :-Had we a Government which had redeemed the disasters of the war; had we a Government which had negotiated and completed, under great difficulties, a satisfactory peace; had we a Government under which, whatever its merits or demerits might be, this country was now flourishing ? (An outburst of disapprobation followed this statement, which proceeded mainly from the body of unemployed workmen in front of the barrier, who, with much gesticulation, denied that the country was flourishing, and fiercely vociferated, "20,000 of us are starving-its shameful.") Perhaps they would allow him to fim8h his sentence ? (Oheers, " No, no !" and uproar.) He said that the country was flourishing. Th it sentiment appeared to give great offence to sonme of his friendLs of the working classes who were near him. He, fortunately, was accustomed to address large masses of the working men of this country, and he should not stand thereupon that occasion were it not for the exertions of the working men of England. (Cheers.) He was as unnoticed and unknown, so far as regarded the functions of a public man, as any one before him when he happened to utter some sentiments upon those husttngs more than 20yews ago, prposing Mr. George Grote, which touched the hearts and excited the approbation of the working men of Northampton. Those working men asked him to represent them. He went down; they returned him to Parliament, and they had continued to return him ever since; and if they would go to Northampton and ask his character of the workig men there he thought that it would prove satisfactory. (Cheer&) He was, however, deeply sensible that a large mass of deserving, industrious. able men in this metropolis were unfortinately out of work cheers); and he was engaged at this very moment in aiding individuals much more influential than himself in endeavouring to make another bridge to highly remunerative labour in countries where the thews and sinews of a man were appreciated at theirfull value, and where a working man, if he were only moderately frugal and moderately prudent, might realize a competence. (Cheers.) This was entirely a digression; but, having shown that he was not insensible to the position and demands of the working classes, perhaps they would tear what he had to say. [Te working men near the barrier were quite pacifie by this courteous recognition of their claims, and they cheered the hon. member throughout the remainder of his address; but the crowd in the body and atthe far end of the hall, to whom these rermarks scarcely;Penetrated, increased their lainour so as Aimos effectually to drown the voice of the speaker.] As the precise expre8sion which he had used hadgiven offence, he would say that, with somelarge andmostpainfulexceptio"s thegeneral trade and commerce of the country were flourishing. Ths Government, moreover, had promised l rge reductiens of expenditure; they had taken off the war 9d. from the
income-tax; and now the practical question which he uti to the common sense of Englishmen was this-would they disturb everything, would they upset the existing Gover.- nient, however much they might disapprove it, when the wisest men in England could not point out to them any set of statesmen who could combine together with credit to themselves and carry on the Government at home? (Cheers.) That he took to be the real question, and to it he asked them to apply that sound practical good sense which more than anythg else distlnguished the people of this country. Before that sound practical good sense how the mlsts and vapours of rhetorical and oratorical power faded and disa. peared ! Nothing now remained in the minds of tho.s who heard him of all those eloquent and splendid orations upmr the China subject which had been delivered in the House of Commons-all bad vanished Into infinite space; but the practical sense of the peopleof thiscountry remaiced, and it had already pronounc its verdict upon the question of the day. (Cheers, anduproar.) LI the gaUant and good old Duke of Wellington had been alive we never shoul A have heard of that question. That great man embodied in his own mind the common sense of Englishmen-he was, ia fact, the sublime of common sense. (Cheers.) And whxt was his maxim? " Choose the best men you can for difficalt positions, and when you have honestly chosen them honesI.ly support them-don't send a public functionary 3,000 miles of and load his mind and conscience with grave responsibihties unless you trust him, and if you trust him stand by him." (Cheers.) That was the maxim of the IronDake, and e was sure that it was a sentiment to which they would all respond. (Renewed cheering.) Well, but that was " the very head and front of the offending, of the Government, who were no more responsible for the unfortunate occurrences in China than any person present at that meeting. (Cheers and renewed confusion.) They had heard a good deal of abuse of Sir J. Bowring. H3e had never been honoured with Sir J. Bowring's friendship, bat he had known him for many years, and he knew him first as a member of the Peace Socety. (Cheers.) He believcd most sincerely that a more humane and forbearin men never hved, and be thought that they, the people of England, had somethinig to do with this question. (Cheers and
CAUto do with it.") Was the name of Sir J. Bowring that of a born aristocrat? No. Had he been the younger son of some peat ducal family, or had he boasted great political connexions, they would have heard much less of this matter; but SirJ. Bowring was a man of the peoplehe had sprung from the people-he had been sent to Parliment by the working men, and there he had always advocated the principle of his great master, Bentham-".the greatest happmess of the greatest number." (Cheers ) Would they then, as Englishmen who loved fair play, tur
round upon the first possible occasion, and crush such;a man as that ("No" and cheers.) He did not think they would. Did they wish, then, to throw a Government overboard in order that they miight dive down into the dark waters on the chance of finmding a better? What Government, he asked, was possible? Would they have Lord Derby? (Vehement cries of "No,") He should epeak from those hustings wish a desire to assume th smouldality of history, and he promised them that the hear no party speech f rom him. Lord Derb a odte isl
that he couid not take the Government wtout Lords Palmersten and Clarendon. Did the people of England wish to have a coaliton Governiment, then? Didl they desire that Mtr. Gladstone, and Mr. Sidney Hferbert, and that select body of ver talented mn i mmn
called "Peeslites " should coaluesce with loondcommony
form aGovernment? ((Cris f ,, . ,,r Derby .an cl-u;iM,~ ~Lgiuws

If they would bear with him a little he would not detain themlong, but -would put the uestion before thema in the shape of a slight but honest anTiMPArb sketch of the state of partie,. This a3peal met with no response, and, as the intervention Of the ~Lrd Mayvor failed to restore quiet, Mr. Currie concluded by stating that he should have had much pleasure in addressing them at greter length; but in the excitedl state of the hail he would not prolong the ineonvenieiice which they were no doubt suffering from the over-crwig n he should therefore at once move-- codng n

In power, or whether he was to be supplanted by Lord Derby What had taken place at Canton was not an isolated fact, at it was part of a tsyem which had enduread for more than 20 years. Lord Pa,inerston had nGt fonnded it, and if Lord Derby were in his place to-morrow he would supt the same sstem, or if he had been in power at the time, aided by Gladstone and Disraeli-«he Siamese twins of taxation-he must have done exactly the same thing. (Cheers.) However we might lament the war, there was not a British statesman with brains in his head or a heart on his left side who would not have supported our representative in China. Much had been said about the eviis of the Chin, system-the smuggling of opium into the country and the tribute of silver. When Lord Derby was in power, didhe alter that system? ("No.") If he were in power to-morrow would he alter it? ("No.") If Gladstone weoa restored to offlce would he return the tribute of silver to the Chinese? ("No.") Of course not. The present outcry, then, was but the trick of a party to get into lace, and they ought to resist it to a man. (Cheers.) These men were out and they wanted to be in. They pointed to the shop over the way-to the counting-house of the nation,andtheysaid, "We want to turn those men outandto open the shop ourselves." They want to do the business and brokerage of the nation at sn eighth les. "The people over the way have only one chief clerk, one cashier, they said; "we have two, who wilu unite in taxin youtwo men who dearly love each other." (Cheers laughter.) He never believed that the men of London would abandon the best interests of the nation merely to bring men into power because they were hungry after place. Who was Lord Palmerston ? He was a man about whom there wasa great difference of opinion, he admitted; but, if they wished to make Palmerston a Reformer, the way to do it was to return a reforming Parliament to St. Stephen's, and he would be boand that Lord Palmerston would then be a Reformer. (Loud cheers.) Let them remember what Lord Palme'ston had done. Whatever his antecedents might have been, he had done one thing which would perpetuate his name in history, and whichought to command their gratitade and thanks. n a moment of danger, and when the reputation of the nation-which was moro important than its wealth-was in peil, he interposed and saved us b bringin the war to a go.ionus termination and concluding a safe and honourable peace. (Cheers.) Whatevertheymightthink of Lord Palmerston, he declared that he had shown the wisdom of a statesman and the vigour of a man and now that a general election was approaching he cazUed upon the constituencies of England to look about them and to choose enlightened and upright men to represent them. (Much cheering.) Heconjured themto selectreprasentatives,not delepates. ' Aboveallthings, nhe said, "keep outthe Derbyitb; let's resist the invasion of these European Chinamen, let them not board the vessel of the Stte or drag down the flag of the empire; let them not assassiate the charactars of our envoys, or poison the political food of the people." (Loudche4ers.)
Mr. S. MORLEY proposed as an amnendment,-
That the ctizens of London, in publc meeting aesembled, while cbeerfully recognizing the claim of Lord Palmerston to the gratitude of the oDuntry for the energy and ability displayed In bringing the war with Essia to a sucoesfal clo3e, and while determined to support only a UberalanAml,itraston, desire to piece On record their covic. tloa that no Goveminent ought to rsain the public confidence whlcls doesnot steadily Drosecute a domestic policy, embodying the deslres o: the peoplefor social and political progress, and promptly abd irmly to grapplewith those adminlatrative eis, the calamitous power of which the late war so painfully disclosed:"
He observed that the question which they had to decide was that of progress or no progress; and in inviting them to unite in the expression of their attachment to Liberal institutions and Liberal principles, he asked them at the same time to explain to Lord Palmerston what they meant. He vwshed them to bear in mind that we had a home policy s well as a foreign policy, and although he was grateful to Lord Pahmerston for the ability and energy with which he had brought the Russian war to a conclusion, there were some occurrences in the progress of that war which lowered England in the eyes of Europe, and which shwowed how the official system of the Government had broken down under us in the hour of trial-and these occurrences took place when Lord Palmerston was in the Government. (Cheers, and some impatience.) This might appear to be a thricetold tale; bht he appealed to them on behalf of the broken hearts and desolate homes which had resulted from the unprincipled conduct of the men who had failed England in the hour of her extremity. He asked them to remember that of the 30,000 men who fell in the Crimea, 20,000 died of disease the direct result of cold and starvation,-and that, too, at a time when Balaklava was full of food and clothing,-owing to the infamous incompetence of the men who were sent to do our work there. He beheved that corruption was as rampant in the governing class ofthis country as ever; and he wished them to tell Lord Palmerston that if they were tosupporthim,bhemustbefaithfultotthem. (Cheers.) He asked them not to forget the infamous conduct of the Government towards those truly noble men Colonel Taulloch and Sir J. 3rNerln, who, because they had bravely done their duty, had been snubbed and insulted. (Cheers) Ha entreated them to give such expression to their sentiments at that meeting as would impart a tone to the coming elections, because they could not conceal from themselves that there were many prominent members of the Liberal party who had deserted them in the hour of trial. He wanted them to prevent such men getting into the House of Commons again upon the back of Lord Palmerston. (Cheers.) Lord Palmerston' himself had treated contemptuously every attempt of earnest men to obtain anything substantial for the people; and he defied any one to point to a single incident in the noble lord's previous career which would justify any confidence in him as a real friendof the people. (Cheers, and "Oh, oh !" and uproar.) He made these remarks because he believed that there had been a foul outcry raised gainst some of the most indepeadent thinkers in the }Rouse of Commons, who had often shown themselves the true friends of the people, and who he was confident had entered into no coaition with the opposite aide of the House. There was no fear of political reform if the people woald only be true to themselves; but he protested azainst an outery being raised against honest and consistent Reformers, becanse they had chosen upon a recent occasion to vote against the Government. (Cheers.)
Mr. J. P. GAssroT seconded the amendment, and expressed his belief that if they pressed reform upon the Governmernt it would be conceded.
Mr. Alderman RosE said he wished to address a few words to the meeting before it was called upOn to choose between the resolution and the amendment which had been proposed. The object and purpose of that amendment was to get them to express sentiments with which he believed the great majority of that meeting did not coincide, but, on the contrary, would show their marked disapprobation. (Cheers, and cries of " No," and great uproar, which lasted for some minutes, and quite overpowered the worthy alderman's efforts to be heard, even by those nearest to him.) After some time Mr. Rose was heard to say that the real question the coantry had to decide was whether her destinles were to be gaided by Lord Palnmerston or Mr. Disraeli and Lord Derby which again led to shouts of disapprobation and prolonged uprqar. The meeting, he contended, must give its support to those who supported their consuls all over the world, and who in foreign lands upheld the honour of the British flag, making it widely respected; and that all who sought its shelter and protection, whether high or low, foreigner or Englishman, should not trust to its help in vain. This sentiment was received with loud cheers, in the midst of which the oppositionists msanife-ted some expression of adverse feeling, and were met with loud cries of " Order, '" ilence," chees, &c. The old adage of " Preserve me from my friends" wzas then practicaUy ilustrated, inasmuch as derman Rose's supporters cheered so vehemently and at such untoward intervals that it became quite impossible to hear two consecutive sen. tences of what he said. He, however, was understood to tay that he thanked the meeting for the hearing they had sofar given him, and that, though he was anxious to consult their convenience with regard to time, yet that in sach a crlsis as the present he had felt it his duty to come forward and caU Upon them to sunport Lord Palmerston.
Mr. EBDWI JArES, Q.C., who was received with much apparent good feeling, said an appeal was about to be made to the country on the decision of the Eouse of Commons, and -the city of London, as the foremost constituency of that great empire, was calUed upon to record its feelings as to whether Lord Palmerston had the confidence of this country or not. (Loud cheers, uproar, and crioe of "Yes !") It was natural that in the course of such a discussion as had taken place that day some of the topics introduced should have been discursive and at large from the question at issue, but nevertheless he woald ventare shortly upon their patience in addressing to them a few remar'ks in suppart of the original resolution. (Much cheering.) The amendment which had been moved by his friend Mra Morley was one which none could dissent from, and it affirmed an abstract proposition of the principle of which he was himself a supporter, and which he was glad to see m3r. Morley had supported so long and energetically; but still it was quite consistent that the original resolution, expressing the entire confidence of the public in Lord Palherston at this juncture, should be preferred to any abs-tract proposition, however laudable in itself, It was not a, question, as his friend Mr. Morley had put it, whether or not Lord Palmerston was to hold the Ministry for ever -the question really was, whether that meeting considered that Lord Palmerston had disgraced himself ? (loud cries of "No, no !") Was it a disrace to have uphedd the rational honour against a deliberate insult offered to the British flag? The matter had been fully discussed by all the lawyers of the House of Commonsa
and-each had made a case according to his own politicai
views. (Cbeers.) But it was not a question of law, but of common sense and feeling. (Much cheering.) Did any man in his own heart doubt for a moment but that that barbarian Yeh had offered an intentional insult to the British 9lag ' (Great cheering.) That was his motive, and be had succeeded in it; and was it not a miserable quibble of his apologists to talk of the colonial register of the lorcha having expired? If a Cbinamar. knocked down an English mercbant, and the latter sought redress, would It be considered any excnse for the Chinese to say that the man he so assaulted was a Portuguese, on the ground that though he had traded and bought and sold with hin as an Englishman, vet that there was a flaw in the reglster of his baptism, ina so he would consider him a Portuguese while he attacked him? (Laughter and cheers.) People spoce of the oppression of PAlmerston's polic, but he would liie to askwhat war Lord Palmerston had ever coiinenced? (Cheers.) Lord Palmerston, at least, was actuated by a jealous sense of the national honour, which had certainly not been the case either with the Earl of Aberdeen or Mr. Gladstone. What was his conduct with regard to France in 1840, when M. Thiers was French Ministor, and anxious to pick a quarrel with England, and he asked for the remains of the greatest captain that had everlived, Napoleon, to be carried bak to France? What was Lord Palmerston's answer to that request when he gave his-consent? "That he trusted the animosities which had so long divided France and England would be buried in the same grave ;" and from that date had commenced the good feeling whlih ad continued to increase till it led to the strict alliance Which joined the two countrie
&t the present day. Lord Palmerston's lic had never been an aggregsve one (cheers, and cries of No," and Yes,"ad gret uproar.) At his very noame the despotic Co 't o Europe tremnbled (peat eheerin), and ho (Mr. 3ames) could imagne the joy and exults-
tion which hailed the division of the House of Commons b-oght about by one of th most unprincpled oliticai combinations that ever existed.(Cher, an,d,cries orNoP'

Those des otip Courts, however, might withhold their exultation for thbe p nt, a be believed the verdict of the English people would not endorse the deciaion of the House of Comnmon& (Tremendous cheering He, however, quite agreed with the principle of Mr. Morley's amendment, and thought that. every
hinister, even Lord Palmerston, should told tha he mnust go with the stream of social and political progress and be truoted soon to see his Lordship dt the head of huomh a strong Liheral majority as would compel him to do so. He trusted to see in such a case the working cilasss be,tter cared for (much cheering, anud the franchise liberally extended. (Der. fLrd Palmrston was not chosen, whom were they tolook to?I Did they 'wish to have Lord Derby and 31r. Disreli sitting in the sarme Cabinet with Gladstone, Aberdeen, and Lord John RuAsetl? (Groins and cries of " No, no I") Let them look at the quesfion thus, and recollect, if they did not have Lord Palmerston, whom they would havo to take inst NO one wanted Lord Palmerston for ever, but aU No for this juncture, for the keepi o the raequid hionor s safe with him. (Cheers.) or such reasns he Conur upon the city of London to como forward and Kive an example to the rest of the constituency, and lead taem to place confidence in a statosman who had never deserted their interests. (Great cheering, which was continued for some time, with calls for the resolution to bo put.)
Mr. Po=rrx, a liveryman, who was received with such shouts of dimpprobation that he had et difficulty in maing his voice heard tried to address the meeting in sup. port of the amendment (as we believe). He persevered in his fruitless attempts for some minutes, but soon exhauted his voice and was forced to give in.
The LOaD MAYOn then, having read the original resolu. tion and amendment, put the latter to the meeting, and about 150 hands were held up in anpport of it. The original resolution was then put, and carried by an overwhelming majorityamid great cheers, which were continued till his Lordship announced the result in the usual form.
hMr.R.W. Cs.wruiw, one of the proposed new candidates for the cty, moved the next resolution, which was to the following effect:
That a commltte, consaitng of 6ir Jamaes Dake, XI,, Mr. alikes Carrie, )LP., Mr. John Dillon, Mr. 1B. W. Crarwfd, Mtr. Thomasa Dakin, Vr. Edwin Jaines, Alderman Bose, Bir 0. D. Crosgey, Mlr. Herbert Lloyd, Mr. J. IL iuiott, Mr. W. 3. HAD, MrB. L Olive:s, LP., Vr. Gordon Allan, Mr. Robert Bosley, Mr. T. Holt, Mr. RoDert Obbrd, and rr. Thomm Christy be sppointed to draw up an ad,reos embodying tho spirit of tho foregoing sowluton - that the Right Hon. the Lord Mayor be hereby authorized to sgn the ame by order and on behalf of this meeting ; and that the oDmmittea be a deputation to p esent the same to his Lordsbip.
He said he came there that day like any other visitor to the meeting, and as one of the merchants of the city of London interested in the subject which now engaged so much of their attention, and to coincide with the expression of the feeling which they entertained in reference to Lord Palmerston. Whatever might be their opinions with respect to the caues which led to the war with China-and he was not then going into the subject, or to reopon the question of that miserable lorcha (cheers), for he was the paxtisan of no party and only came forward to say that the country required that a hearty and cordial upport should be given to the present Government. (Cheers.) He felt, in common with that meeting and the rost of the nation, a dislike of the combination of parties-of that "fortuitous concurrence of atoms," as Lord Palmerston himself most happll7 called it, which had placed all the members of the House in the predicament of coming before the grand jury of the country. (Cheers.) He sympathized most heartily in the amend. ment which M1r. Morley had brought forwArd. He did not look upon Lord Palmerston as a thoroughly good politician, yet he should unhesitatingly support him at the present juncture, because he considered him to be the only man capable of forming a linistry that really could govern the country. Lord Palmerston, he was sorry to say,did not support the baUot-extension of tho suffrage, or even the swhemes for the repeal of Jewish disa. bilities. On those grounds, therefore, he (lr. Crawfurd) was prepared to go even further than Lord Palmerston, and to give his cordial support to any man who would strivo to carry into effect the great mneasures to which he had adverted. (Cheers.)
Mr. LAwrixNcE briefly soconded the resolution, and called upon tho meeting not to bo any party to condemning useful publc servants unheard? at a time when they were cting to the best of their abilty to protect the lives and interests of their fellowv-countrymen abtosal. (Cheers.)
The resolution was then carried by acclamation.
On the motion of Sir J. DtlKx, seconded by Mr. H. WfAITHSA it wvas resolved-

IMPORTANST APPROACaiS AND NEW STREETS IN T
VICrORIA PARK-ROAD.
A deputation attended the Board from the vestrb of Mile-end Old-town, and the Board of Works for the Limehouse district, to submit plans and egtimates for the formation of the Victoria Park-road approaches. The deputation was introduced by Mr. Snow, and consisted of the following gentlemen :-Messrs. Attrell, Bird, Moodr, Ieatherdale, Philpot (clerk), and Lemon 5surveyor). The deputation presented the following mnemorial:-
11The memorial of the ratepayers and owners of property in the damlet of Ratclifo and the parishes of St. Anne, LAmehonse, and St. Paul. ShadweilL in the cnunty of Mikddlese, showeth-
" That a direct communleatlon between the Comnmercial-road east, the sM-end-road and the Victoria Plark would be highly advantageous to the hamlet of Ratcliffe and the parishes of St. Anne, St. George-or,the-hmt, St Paul Shadwel, and St. John, of WappIng, containing together apeDulation of upwards of 100 000 persons
That yoar memonaltiss have asertained with foe*lncg or the most lively satisfaction that it Is intended to form a new line of strsetg from the Stepney station of the Dlackwal, eNoth ndon. Norti Woolwicb, Gravesend. and Southend Railway to the &tile-fEnd-road and the Victoria Park.
"That the incremed ani increwaing traffni between the wharfs of Warping, Shadweli, and Ratco, and the tMle-end-road imporatively demandats a xpw and direct line of thoroughfare.
"That your memnoriarets hare aertained that a new street fro
the Stepney station to the MIle-end-road and Victoria Park oDuld be constructed at an expense of £SOO
"That your memorialits have been informed that another new street, from the East India-rod to the Mleend-road and Victoria Peark, has been projected, and a plan of the same prepared, and that the estimated expense is 43%WaO, being £20,e mnore than the eCALimated nest of the new street from the Stepney station.
".That youxr memorlallica are Informed and believe that a new street from the East India-road to the Mile-end-road anid the Victoria Park could not be constracted for leM than £X6u 0d and that It the plan was apprTovd of it would he necessry to purchase a rope. ground and compensate the owner thereof for the lose of his business, which wouild Involve an outlay of £i0,0t)0. That a n-ew street from the Fas Indla-read to the Mle-end-roal and Victoria Park would be of no use or benefit to your memoriali;s, inasmuch as the terminus of the rams is at least half a raile from the eastern boundary of the hawlet of Riteliffe, and a mncb greater diatane fonfr the densely-
uoylated parishes of St George, St. John of Wapping, and Shad.
"That your memnoriallsta rspecttully submit that the new line of street projected from the Stepoey station to she Mrile-end-road and Victoria Park could bo constrocted at one-tblrd of the expense of a new street from the East Inda-road, sd pose-sees manifold advantages, both as regards economy and public utiuWty, over every other
"Your o meoiaisi therefore, humbly solicit tbo Mletropolitan commencing in the East InDdia-reoaed, aand tto°n approe ofhe p lansote forct itatoliffe, to the victoria Park and MlSe-end-road, and from Highbstreet. Stepney, to the t410be-road"
This memorial was very numerously signed.
Mr. ATTrELL (one of the deputation) strongly enforced the views of the memorialists, and said, that at a meeting held upon this subject the freeholders had offered voluntarily to give up the ground for the formation of the Globeroad, which would give great additional accommodation to a densely populated district of not less than 100,000 perBons-
Mr. SKrLT.r, a member of the Limehouse Board, supported the plan as originaly submitted by Lord Dangannon to the House of Commons.
Mr. SNow moved, that the memorial aud plan now brought up be referred to the Committee of Works and Improvements.
1r. CRELLIN seconded the motion, which was put and carried unanimously.
The tender for the reinstatement of the buildings of the United Service Museum, in Middle Scotland-yard, was gained by Messrs. Piper and Sons for 7341.
A number of compensation cases for loss of office, in consequence of the passing of the Metropolis Local lanagement Act, occupied the Court for severas hours; but the details were unworthy of report.
The Board then adjourned.

THE CHuRcH ESTATES Owm xSS 0NES.- The report of the Church Estates Commissioners (the sixth general one) was published yesterday. Daring the past year they have approved the terms agreed on in 255 cases, 232 being cases of sales of reversions, and 23 of purchase of leasehold interest, while the value in fee of the estates so agreed to be dealt with exceeds 0000001. The aggregate vamber of cases enumnerated in &tc yearly reports as approved is therefore 1,082, and the Talue of the property dealt with 4,200,OOOL and upwards.

A SUBSTITUTE FOR SILKWORMS.-Happily, there
A SUBSTITUTh FOR SnL1WORMs.-Happily, there would seem now to be little need of the cria, or the Chinese sUkworm, or of the cocoon of commerce, for the pro. duction of silk will ere long in all probability be derived, not from tho worn, but the leaf on which it has hitherio existed. It is now not the breeding of the insect, but of the mulberry tree-that species which was its only food, and which from that circumstance gave the savant the cue that led to his making the intimated discovery. His name has not yet been announced, although we should imagine it was none other than Signor Lotteri who in the course of last 3 ear fully ascertained that a siky substanoo could be pro. cured from the bark of the mulberry tree, and that by mace. ration good silk, and paper also, could be easily prepared therefrom. The savant in question, ruminating, it is said, on the circumstance of the silkworm living on one description of food, came to the conclusion that "the silky substance must lio not in the animal, but tho vegetable matteer which supported it. He therefore " analyzed the composition of the mulberry-leaf, and, by boiling it to a thick paste, oproduced every description of silk in immense quantities." Such a substance being obtained from that species of leaf, it is not at all unlikely that from the Chinese oak and the castoroil plant a somewhat similar result might be obtainedL Be that as it may, andtbe truth of the other being shortly corroborated, neither Moreton-bay need sigh for the introduction of the cotton plant, nor the northern and southerm States of America shed their blood for the suppression or in the defence of slavery, nor England much longer play the hypocrite by condemning that accursed "institution' with one breath and with another admitting the expediency of, at al hazards, strenuously upholding it. This is the land -every land within the temperate zone is, more or lessfavourable to the rearing of the vine, the mulberry, and the olive. Ever one, therefore, the possessor or occupier of a small spot of ground therein, may rear the great substitute for cotton, and, in so doing, weaken more and more this lamentable and apparently indispensable adhesion to slavery.

HOUSE OF LORn R- ->Th xr. -.
_ BOYSE V. ROSSBOROUGH ASD OTITER5R
'jns was an appeal from a decision of the Court of Chancery in Ireland, refusing a new trial of an issue devisavt rve non directed by that Court, upon which a verdict was found that a certain paper writing, dated the 6th of August, 1842, was not the last wiU and testament of Mr. CGesar coiclough, deceased, of Tinteru-abbey, in the county of Wexford, so far as related to his Wexford estates. Those estates produced an income of 8,0001. per annum, and had been in the testator's family for many years. Mr. Colelough died on the 23d of August, 1852, leaving the appellant, Jane Stratford Boyse, then Jane Stratford ColCough, his widow. Shortly after his death that lady married Thomas Boyse, who died since the commencement of this suit. Mr. Boyse after Mr. Colclough's death claimed to be his sole devisee and legatee under tho alleged will of the 6th of August, 1842, and as such entered into possession of the Wexford estates, and took possession of his personal pro. perty, amounting to 70,0001. Mr. Colclough dying without leaving issue, the respondent, then Mary Grey 'Wentworth Colclough, spinster, since married to the other respondent, John Thomas Rossborough, claimed to be bis heiress-at. law, being his cousin. On the 7th of September, 1849, the respondents filed a bill, alleging that the appellant immediately after her marriage with Mr. Colelough had formed, and had continualy persevered in, a systematic plan to separate and estrange Mr. Colelough from al members of his family, and that she had acquired not only undue infla ence, but complete command and control over Mr. Colclough, so as to deprive him altogether of free agency over his estates and affairs, The cause of "iRossborough v. Boysell was heard on the 13th and 31st of January, 1852, in the Court of Chancery, in Ireland, when an issue dervjsit re non was directed to try the validity of the alleged wiLl, the appellant to be the plaintiff and the respondents the defendants. The issue was tried at the summer assizes of 1852 before Baron Pennefather and a special jury, when, after a trial which lasted for several days, a verdict was found ag3inst the alleged will. The case of the appeUant on thetria was that differences had arisen long before Mr. Colclough married between himn and his relations, several of whom, during the lifetime of his father, had obtained leAes of parts of the Wexford estates much under their vaho, and ho was obliged, on succeediDg to the estates, to set those leases aside by legal proceedings. In consequence of that and other grounds of complaint he became much dissatisfied with his relations, and regarded them with no personal attachment. After the trial the appellant moved before the Lord Chancellor of Ireland that a new trial might be had of the issue, on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of evidence, and that a material witness en behalf of the appeUant was absent during the triaL The appellant also prayed that the venue might be changed to Dublin. Affida,its were filed in support of and in opposition to that motion, and after the arguments hadlasted several days the Lord Chancellor refused the motion with costs on the 18th of April, 1853. On the 19th of April, 1853, a decree was made deClaring the aleged wll to be null and void with respect to the Wexford estates, and ordering an injunction to issue to the sheriff of the county to put the respondents into possession of the estates. The present appeal was brought against the decision of the Lord Chancelor of Ireland refusing a new trial, and against the decree of the 19th of April, 1853
The arguments-which lasted over ten days-before their Lord6hips were heard in July of last year, when it was urged in support of the appeal that the order directing the issue was not in conformity with the principles nor within thejurisdiction, of a court of equity,inasmuch as the plaintiff in the suit was only entitled to such relief as would remove any legal impediment to an action of ejectment ; that if the order directing the issue was held to be correct, then that a newv trigl, under the circumstances of the case, ought to have been grunted to enable the appellant to adduce new evidence; and, as regarded the decree of the 19th of April, 1853, it was alleged to be erroneous, on the ground that it was beyond the jurisdiction and contrary to the rules of a court of equity to declare the invalidity of a wiU, and also because the said decree gave relief which superseded the former wills of Mr. Colough, none of which had been adjudicated inval It was contended by the counsel for the respondents that it was in the discretion of a court of equity to direct an issue (Wevisavit vd non to try the validity of the aleged will; that there being no complaint as to the admission or rejection of evidence at the trial
and no objection having been made to the judge's charge to the jury, the court of equity had no power to grant a new trial, its province being simply to see that the trial had been properly conducted, and it being beyond its jurisdiction to weigh the evidence for the purpose of deciding whether the jury had found rightly upon the facts; that it was not open to the ap llant to apply for a new trial on the ground that she haanot adduced evidence which she hadi her power and could have produced at the trial
that it would be most injurious to the respondents to have a new trial granted, several of their vitnesses having died, others having gone to America, and the affidavits of three of them going to show that attempts had been made in order to induce them to giva different evidence upon a second trial. It was then submitted that, even if aU these points were found against the respondents, yet the undue influence exercised over the testator by his wife was clearly made out by the evidence adduced at the trial, fnd therefore no new trial could he granted. At the conelusion of the arguments their Lordships had deferred givingjudgment.
The LORD CHANCELLOR this morning delivered the judgment of the House, and said that as regarded the first point urged on behalf of the appellant, as to the power of the court of equity to direct an issue, he considered it was quite within the discretion of the Courc of Chancery either to direct an issue or to give such relief as would remove any legal impediment to bringing an action ofejeotment. The Court of Chancery had exereised its discretion in the present case, and the House would not interfere with that discretion unless they saw that mauifest injustice had arisen therefrom. No injustice had been done in the present case and therefore the appeal, so far as it rested upon the want of jurisdiction, must faiL Then came the question as to whether the Court below was right in refusing a new trial. Jpon thatpointhe (the Lord Chancellor) considered the decision of the Court below was wrong, under the circumstances of the ease. As regarded the last argament of the respondents, he did not see trom theevidence that there was any compulsion or fraud proved at the trial to have been used by the appellant towards the testator in order to induce him to make his will in her favour. Under these circumstances he (the Lord Chancellor) should advise the House to reverse the decision of the Court below so far as regarded the refusal to grant a new trial and the subsequent decree, and the ease must be sent back to Ireland for a new triaL.
Appeal allowed accordingly.
aBOYvs V. COLCLOlUGI.
This was a supplemental appeal between the same parties a'ain:~ a subsequent order of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, directing the appelant to pay over the sum of 21,961L, the net sum which the appellant had received out of the estates since she had been in possession.
The LORD CHANCELLOR said this decree would follow the fate of the other.
Appeal allowed.

woforc tu MAsTER OF THE ROLLS.) --
lils klONOUR gave judgment in this case, which came before the Court as to the construction of a clause in the wiUl of the late John Benet, of Pyt-house, Tisbury, Wilts. By this clause the testator directed the trustee of his wil to pay certain legacies, "and to levy and raise money to pay, in the first place, the encumbrances upon his estates, by such means (except by sale or sales) as the trustees might deem advisable." The questions raised were-first, whether the prohibition to seU the estates precluded the trustees from mortgaging; and, secondly, whether all the debts and encumbrances were to be paid in fuU before the tenants for life could come in and participate. The Court held that the word "le" includel a mortgage, hut that, although the primary object of the testator was to pay the charges on his estates out of the rentso yet that such charges were not to be defrayed to the total tempora exhaustion of the estates and ex.cluson of the tenants forlie from participationfe

Mfr. GLASSE appeared for Biham, and supported the plaintifs case.
Mr. WrosENs, for the defendant, read the answer, which stated that the plaintiff and Bilham, who had lately come into his neighbourhood (in Suffolk, the parties being all farmers), called upon him, and wished to borrow some money of him, but the security they offered was so unsatisfactory that he at first declined, but ultimately consented to lend them 7001. on the footing of receiving for it a mortgage security for 1,0001. That arrangement was agreed upon, and tbe deed prepared and executed accordingly. The tender of 7001, and then 8001., was made, and on its being refused, interest was stopped.

A more unjustifiable attempt was never beard of than the plaintiff's contention; so far from the Statute of Frauds applying to the defendat,it applied to the plaintiff, for it was he who was seeking to vary a written instrument, which wss part of a bargain proved to have been made, that for a 1,000. security 7001 should be given, the security being so unsatisfactory, and the 3001. being a bonus for the risk on the transaction.

BARTLETT V. BABTRTT.
This was a petition for the purpose of obtaining payment to the petitioner of a sum of Consols now in court.
la. 3. Bartlett, being entitled to a reversionary interest expectant on the death of his mother, Elizabeth Bartlett. in a fund standing in the name of the Accountant-General to
the account of the defendant, Elizabeth Bartlett and her children," by deed dated in March, 1846, assigned the same to W. O. Tucker absolutely. By deed dated in October, 1849, Tucker assiPned the above share to Mss Holmes (now the wife of the petitioner (W. B. Monypenny) by way of mortgage for securing the repayment of 1841, and interest. Tucker very shortly after the assignment tohim obtained a stop order to prevent the share assigned to him being paid out of court without notice to him; but Miss Iolmes had not obtained any such order. In October, 1854, Tucker became bankrupt, and in September last the defendant, Elizabeth Bartlett, died, whereupon the fund in court became divisible among the parties entitled to it. It was contended, on behalf of the assignees in bankruptcy of Tacker, that, as Miss Holmes did not ob. tain a stop order on the share assigned to her, such share remained in the order and disposition of Tueker at the time of his bankruptcy, and therefore passed to his assignees. The share was insufficient to pay the whole amount due on the mortgage to Mliss Holmes.
Mr. WaUler appeared for the petitioner, Mr. Mony. pnny, and Mr. Hardy for the assignees in bankruptcy of
The VICE-CHANCELLOR said that the ob'ect of the stop order was to prevent any person obtaining the fund without notice to the party who procured the order ; and its effect was rather to show that the fund was not in the order and disposition of the person who procured the stop order; nor was it necessary for the puypose of completing the title of an assignee of a fund, but at was no more than a protection to an assignee against fraud by an assignor. He was of oDinion that the share in question was not in the order and disposition of the bankrupt at the time of his bankruptcy, and that the petitioner was entitled to an order as prayed, the costs of tho petition to be paid by the assignees.
Mrs. Monypenny, late Miss Holmes, appeared in Court and consented to the payment of the share in question to her husband, the petitioner.

Mr. D.eisNI (with whom was Mr. H. Stevens) stated to the Court that the miEdescription in the bill arose from a misapprehension on the part of the gentleman who had taken the plaintff's instructions, and had supposed her to be a single woman;* and the learned counsel asked leave to amend the bill by putting it in p roper form and making the husband a party, the costs of the present motion to be costs in the cause.

PRIESTLEY V. HOLGATE.
This was a suit instituted by the personal representative of one James Priestley, asking for the payment of certain legacies bequeathed to him by the testator Joseph Priestley. The bequest, which was contained in a codicil, was as follows

Mr. Prendergast (Mr. Rolt with him) appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Cairns and Mr. Fischer for the defendants.
On the one hand it was argued that, inasmuch as " returning" was a continuous process, and that the intention of the legatee to return to this country was clear, his death in itinere, being the act of Providence, ought not in this Court to deprive him (or his representative) of the ful benefit of the legacies given by the codicil; while, on the other hand, the defendants contended that the return " to England" of James Priestley was a condition precedent to his obtaining the legacy of 400&.,-& condition which could not be said to have been complete by his mere embarcation for this country.

'This was an adjourned examination meeting in the case of the above bankrupt.
tnr. L&wE.xc, for the assignees, said, that, although the accounts had be~en before the Court some time, great alterations were still considered necessary. There Was a discrepnancy in the accounts in respect to 400 and odd 9uar. ters of malt, which it was necessary should be explafned. The bankrupt had taken credit in his assets for bank-notes to the amount of 7001., but the notes having at the time passed into the hands of Messrs. Masterman and Co. they could only be written off their account.
Mr. Whitmore, the offlcial assignee, said ho could not pass the accounts in their present form. The bankrupt had in December, 1854, exectited a post-nuptial settlement. The validity of that settlement must depend on the state of bis affairs. It would be the duty of the assignees t-o file a bill in Chancery to set it aside. The bankrupt made it appear that he was solvent at the time of the execution of the settlement, but he had omitted a very large liability arising out of the suit of "Kay against Johnston." All the world acquitted the bankrupt of participation in those proceedings. A laugh.) There had been a decree of 30,0001. against Johnston and others, and it was not improbable that the claim against the bankrupt's estate consequent upon that decree would be compromised by the admission of a proof of about 10,0001. It was uite clear that the 10,0001. must go to the debit of the ban kruptcy at the time of executing the settlement, and the assinees were of opinion that it would exhaust his assumed surplus. Nobody charged the bankrupt with a guilty appropnation of the money that came from the expectant heir (Kay).
Air. Ii.N'CLAxnR, for the bankrupt, said the surplus at the time of the nuptial settlement was 13,000t. Alter ads rnitting the proof of 10,0001. he would thus have been solvent to the extent of 3 0001.
Mr. BAGLEY, for Mr. gwanneo, a creditor for 3,7001., and about 40 other creditors, sked for a Private meeting to examine the bankrupt. They were willing to incur all the expenses of such examination. They did not suggest that the assignees would not do their duty in prosecuting this inquiry. Mr. Elsey, of the Bank of England, was one of the assignees, and, althoughthere miYhtbe no reason to suppose that the Bank of Enldawd would not do its duty, the creditors for 'whom he (rbgley) appeard were of a very different class. They were depositors.

iN RE F. F. SHAW.
The bankrupt was an ironmonger in the Blackfriars-road. This was a sitting for the choice of assignees.
Mr. LiNIUATER., for the petitioning creditor, examined the bankrupt at great length.
It appeared that the bankrupt was a customer of the Royal British Bank, and was in the habit of discounting bills with that company. At the time of his bankruptcy he was indebted to the bank about 1,500l, for which they held several worthless bils. Many of those bils were drawn upon journeymen bricklayers, coffeehouse keepers, journeymeu builders, and others of the same cla's. he acceptots were in those cases described as contractors, engineers, builders, &c., and false addresses were given. Other persons held bills of the same character, and the bankrupt admitted they were fictitious. It appeared also that in November last the bankrupt had sold his stock for 8,0001. to some persons who now carried on the business as a "Ilimited liability company." Nostock valuation wastaken, and no cash payment was made by the " company," who gave their acce tauces forabout 2,5001.,none of which were yet due. The remnainder of the purchase money waspid to the bankrupt in shares of the company, and he paid his father in shares* and otherwse 6X001., and presented a retition for private arrangement in December last. Some of the directors of the company now sought to prove against the estate, and Mr. Linklater complained that the bankrupt's own attorney was endeavouring to get the bankrupt's father-in-law appointed one of the assignees, and the directors who sought to prove voted in favour of the bankrupt's father-in-law.
One of the directors of the company, Mr. Harris, was examined, and tated that the bankrupt was indebted to him an 4001., and that he held bills, which were overdue in December, for part of his debt.
His HONOUR said, there was very much to be inquired into on the part of the creditors before proceeding to the choice of assignees, as had been shown by the examina tion, which had been very properly conducted. He should therefore order an adjournment, in order that the creditors might have an opportunity of inquiring into the nature of the debts and the position of affairs. It was very necssary in such a case that the creditors should know for whom they were Voting in the choice of assignees, and the memorandum of adjournment should state the reasons given.
frthe cthoice.The libiii°hes akre said to be considerable, and the assets depend much upon the claimis against the company and the bankrupt's fat her.

IN RE W. 0. YOUNG.
The bankrupt was a shipowner, insurance broker, and underwriter. His debts are about 60,0001. This was a dividend meeting.
Mr. GREN, for the assignees, said they proposed now to divide 12, 0001. (as in the hands of Mr. Lee, the omfcial assignee), which would saffice for a dividend of nearly 5sa. in the pound. It was fully expected that in the course of . six months the assets would have realized a further sum sufficient to pay full 5s in the pound more. The estate would thus have paid 10s. in the pound, as originally estimated. He might take that opportumity to say that it was the opinion of the assignees, as well as of himself, that this Court would have administered the estate bDth cheaper and quicker than could have been effected by rvate arrangemenit, or by any other course, considerin that the bankrupt had carried on three businesses, and the nature of the asshts.
His HONOUR observed that he wished Mr. Lavie and others only knew what had been stated.
A dividend will be declared accordingly.

J*mes Booth, omnibusconductor, surrendered, for the third time, to take his tral for embezzling money received by him on account of Arthur Macnamara and others, his
M mu.S G, iwith whom was Mr. F. F. LE,%S, said, the prosecutors, the London General Omnibus Company, represented by Mr. Macnamara, had instituted these proceedgs solely on public grounds, as there was no question tbat
uds of the c aracter imputed to the prisoner were committed to a great extent upon them, and the only method they had of detecting the delinquents was the emplovment of persons to act, m point of fact, as spies, to tAo an account of what the conductor received. This prisoner had already been tried on two indictments, but the evidence had failed to satisfy the jury of his guilt, and they after long deliberation had acquitted hin. There was a third charge against him, but Mr. Ifacnamara authorized him (Mr. Sleigh) to say that, under the circumstances, he would withdrawthat case, as hahadno interest or motMvepersonally in the matter, but vas acting on behalf of a public body and on public grounds. But at the same time he was instructed to say that the plan of espionage would be strictly persevere in, and in every case where a fraud was detected the company would prosecute, for the appropriation of but one fare per journey would make an average loss of over
0, 1. a-year, and there was too good reason to suspect that some conductors wero not satisfied with one fare at a time. Mr. Macnanara was, he thought, actin in a proper and liberal way in not going on with this third charge, and, with the permission of the Court, no evidence would be offered.
Mr. M.TCALFE, for the prisoner, said, Mr. Macnamu_ had throughout the case acted with great propriety and fairness as representing a public company. Hle was very well satisfed at the result.
The AsSIsTA12T-JUDGE said, the company had only done their duty in prosecuting upon the evidence they had, although that evidence had not been considered by the jury such as to justify a conviction; and the withdrawal of the third case showed that Mr. Macnamara only wished to act fairly and on public grounds. It was very important for the company that a proper check should be kept upon their con uctors, some o00 in number, for the abstraction of a single fare per day would on an average amount to an enormous sum. The temptation was great and detection diffi. cult, and the company would be quite justkied in proceeding with the third case if they thought proper, but as they vwshed to withdraw it the Court agreed with the course they proposed to adopt.
A verdiot of S&t Guilty was then taken, and the prisoner was discharged.
Ann Barrett, 29, and William Leach, 21, were indicted for having&stolen a tea-chest and 441b of tea, the property of Robert Jones, a grocer m Wellingtons8treet. Leach pleaded
Mr. PryNB for the prosecution, said, that the woman was oly idicted for stealing, whereas the evidence against her was more calculated to make out a case of receiving. Under these circumstances he should not offer any evidence.
The AssTssANT-JuDGEthought the female prisonermight be convicted of receiving if she were indicted for that offence, but it was not a strong case.
Mr. L,xaGpoRD, for the woman, said, he hoped she might be discharged, as she had a young child in her arms, and this would be a severe warning to fer.
Mfr. PAYNE said, he should advise the prosecutor not to make any further charge against the woman.
She was then found Not Guilty, and hberated.
The AssiSTAST-JUDGE sentenced Leach to six monthse hard labour.
* Two labourers, namod Evans and Williams, were indicted for steaing 801b, of lesd, the property of Her Majesty's Commissoners of Woods and Works.
Mr. Sleigh appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Lsngford for the prisoners.
The prisoners were employedl in pulling down some buifldings in Shoreditch, and th1ey were seen to carry off a quantity of sheet lead which had been stripped from the roof, which they took to a marine store shop to sell and were the taLkenx into custody.

Bdward Jackson, a respectable-looking man, was indicted forlbasing feloniously received a firkin of butter value 31.., wedl knowing that the same had been stolen
Mr. Tayler appeared for the prosecution ; Mr. Coper for the_ risoner.
The proeecultor, George-William Glennister, stated that he was a grocer in Spring-garden.place Stepnoy, and on the 16th of February a trkir of butter was stolen from his shop. On the morning of the 17th he heard that it was gone, first from his sistrr, and then fromi a young man named Searle, whom he did not know before, amd, frominiformation given by him, he went with a poicem n, CoppinDP39 K to au oi and colour shop kep,t by the pri'soner in Lenard-street, Curtain-road. aie said to him," You bought a firkdn of butter last evening which was stolen from y shop." The prisonerreplied, " I've bought no hutter." FWitness thei told him it was useless to deny it, ashehada person outside who saw it stolen, saw it brought to his (prisoner's) shop,
and knew what wa paid for it The prisoner again said he had bought no butter, and at that xmoment the policeman come into the shop, having waited outside, and witness then said to him, "He says he has bought no butter." The policeman said a man was outside 'who saw it brought to his shop, upon which the prisoner said he had not bought it, but had lent some money uponit. He added, "I have been in business many years, and I suppose you have no vindictive feeling against me." Witness ad he had not. Prisoner asked him what the butter cost ? Eae replied, " 3-the weight being about 661b." ?risoner said, " ery well; make out your bill and I will pay you for it. I suppose you don't want to make any bther or disturbance about it'" Some butter was found on the counter. It was what had been stolen from his shop, and was 91b. deficient,
In cross-examination, the witness said he did not see the firkin when he first wentinto the shop, but be did afterwards, Searle came to his shop and told him he had lost the butter, and told him where it was, and that he saw the men come out of the shop and divide the money. The distance between his shop and the prisoner's was between two and three miles, and of course policemen were to be found be. tween the two. He had not looked after the thieves.
Sarah Ivory stated that sho was servant to the prisoner on the 17th of February, and had been so about 16 months. On that morning she took some butter to a neighbourfs-a milk shop-when she saw the policeman, and heard butter mentioned. She was afraid, and, seeing the butter on the counter, took it away, and was seen. It was only a small q,uantity she took. The prisoner did not sell butter in his shop. No one told her to do it, it was her own act, through fear, 'when she heard that the policeman had come about butter. She never saw butter there before.
Henry John Searle saidhe was a blacksmith, and lived in Ratcliffe-highway. He had been out of work amonth, his last employment havmg been at the docks. On the evenine of the 16th oi February he was stan&ng near the prosecutors shop, whenhe saw four men and watched them. One of themr stole a tab of butter from the shop door, near which it was standing on the inside-carried it some distance-then pat it ina ba *ndplaced it on a wheelbarrow. The three others fo owed. They went to the prisoner's shop, when one of the four took it out of the barrow and carried it into the shop. Witness crossed over to a pualichouse, and the men came there to divide the money. One of them said, he had only got I. 3s. for it, and that he (prisoner) was a bad fence, and should not have any more. He 'went to the prosecutor's next morning, and accompanied him and the constable to the prisoner's shop.
in cross-examination the witness said he did not know either of the men, butihe gave a description of them. He did not see a single polceman all the way from the prosecutor's to the prisoner's, and ats no part of the journey were they within a quarter of a mile of a police station. The
risoner had given evidence against a relation of his, but
did not know of it when this occurred. That he would swear. He was once in custody; he happened to be in a marine store shop when a man brought in some lead, and a policeman took him, thinking he was concerned, but he was discharged next morning. He was never in Maidstone Gaol; he got his living by hard work.
Copping, the policeman in the case, corroborated the prosecutor as to what took place at the prisoner's shop.
Mr. Coop} , in his address to the jury, commented 'with great severity uponthewitness Searle, whose conduct, he said, throughout the matter,-bis following the thieves nearly three miles wvithout informing the prosecutor in the
irst instance of the robbery, or seeking the aid of a policeman to prevent the property being carried off effectaally-his statement that he sawv them take it to the prisoner's, and that he heard the men discussing the matter and saying the priSoner was a badfence, without apprising any one of it util the next morning-the fact that he was aware that the prisoner had given evidence against a relation of his, and his taking no steps to lead to the aaprehension of the thieves, suggested the extreme probab ity that he was concerned himself in the theft, and that from motives of revenge he got the butter to be taken to the prisoners shop.
The prisoner persisted now that he never bought the butter at all, but merely lent a person a small sum on it that person promsng to fetch it away in two hours.
Endence was given as to the prisoner's previous good character He hada wife and ten children dependent upon him.

The juryvretired, and after deliberating five hours they came into coulrt, and sid there was not the slightest hope of their agreeing, eight being of one opinion and four of another.

THE QUEEN V. THE DABIRNTAS OF BARDVEY. This was an indictment for the non-repair of a road.
Mr. Macaulay, Q.C., Mr. W. H. Adams, and Mr. Field were counsel for the prosecution ; Mr. Serjeant Hayes and Mr. Flowers for the defendants.
The question in dispute was whether the road indicted was a public highway for cattle and carriages as well as foot passengers, or merely an occupation road for the use of those who hold land on the sides of it; and upon that subject a very large body of witnesses was exanned, isomuch that the learned judge was induced to ask what was the population of Bardney. It appeared that the road afforded the only means of accessfrom the vilage to a large quantity of fen land in the parish, as well as to the site of the ancient abbey of Bardney, and it was relied upon as a circumstance in support of the prosecution that if the road indicted was not a public road no trace could be discovered of any other, and that consequently the abbey must have stood at a very considerable distance from any public highway. From the site of the abbey the road branched in two directions, one leading directly to the village, and the other, nearly at right angles to it, leading to the Wragby tumpike road. This lane had been very little used, except by the occupiers of theadioining lan, and had continued in grass for nearly the woRe length of It to the present time. It was not feneed off from the fields through which it pissed, and there were Six or seven gates in the course of it. About four years ago a very'wann dispute arose in the parish as to the liabiity of the parish to repair it; and the surveyor's accounts ha been objected to because they included some items iorrepirin Very strong evidence, however, was r,ow giver ntnthe parish surveyors had from time to time, as much as 30 and 40 years ago, repaired it out of the parish funds, and that it had always been included in the returns made by the surveyors under the Highway Act of the extent of roads repairable by the parish.
Tha learnedJiDoF, in summing up, expressed his opinion that a strong case of adoption by the paish had been made out- and
Tie jury, some of whom had viewed the road, after retiring for a few minutes, found a verdict of Guilty.
CRowN Cousf.-(Before Mr. Justicc WiG1mrLrs.)
WiMiam Leach, aged 35, shoemaker, was indicted for having, on the 9th of April, 186, feloniously threatened to accuse Batler Hairby Hobson of an abominable offence,with intent to extort money from him, and having thereby extorted from him the sum of 12l.
lr. O'Brien conducted the prosecution; Mr. Flowers defended the prisoner.
The ProSeCutor is a hatter at Boston, and appeared to be naturaly a man of very nervousandexcitable temperament
which had been increasedbyhabits of intemperance, and alsobya charge which had been made against him three or four years ago of an indecent assault committed upon a groom in a railway carriage, and upon which he had been tried in London and acquitted. The prisoner had been a customer of the prosecutor, and in the month of May, 1855, went to the prosecutor's shop in Boston, accompanied by a boy, who asked him if he did not recollect having seen him at Peterborough. The prosecutor had some recollection of having seen him at a dancing room thereon one occasion vhen he was waiting for a train, and said so. The prisoner then requested the prosecutor to lend him 2., and he did so. Nothing more took place onthat occasion, and the 2L was afterwards repaid; but after a further interval the prisonerappeared *gainand requested the prosecutor to lend him 101. He consented, and upon that occasion an agreement was drawn up for the ayment of the sum by instaiments. None of those inm ents was ever paid; and on one occasion, in the month of June, the prosecutor asked the prisoner how it was that he had not paid; whereupon the Drisoner followed him into his ahop, and sAsithatif he ever asked him forthat money again he would have him apprehended for taking indecent liberties with the boy whom he had brought with him on a former occasion; and upon the prosecutor inquiringwhat he meant he added that he would cha e him with anunnatural offence. The prisoner then le t. and nothing more took place until the 9th of April in the follawing year, when the prisoner went again to the prosecutor, and said he must have 12. The prosecutor said that he had only 2. in the house - and the prisoner said that he must have the whole, or le should fetch the boy and a policeman andhave him apprehended. He, however, took the 21, and went away, but inthe evening sawthe prosecutor agamand demandedthe remainder. He went with him to his house, and said he would have a check immediately; and the prosecutor then wrote him a check for 101 in the shop. Subsequently the prisoner obtained various other sums, amounting altogether to about 501, which were the subject of other indictments; and ultimately, about Christmas last, the prosecutor, under the pressure of these repeated extortions, left Boston, and went to Southampton. Thither he was followed by a friend, to whom he revealed the cause of his departure, and under whose advice he returned to Boston, an gave the prisoner into custody on the presentcharge.
In his examination to-day he denied that there was the alightest foundation for the charge made by the pri. sonAer, gut he stated that he had yielded to his demands for some time to avoid so diagreeable an investigation, Upon his cross-examination he acknowledged that he had not before stated that the prisoner had threatened to charge him with the commission of an unnatural offence, but he app during his examination to be in a state of oor ider. able nervous excitement, and at the end of j$ fell down in a fainting fit. He was removed from theiiort in that condition, and a seon who had attended iim subsequently stated to the Curt that he had Trt 'him in a state bordering on insanity. We understood that it was afterwards found necessary to remove him to a lunatic asylum.
Mr. FLOwERs addressed the jury for the prisoner, con. tending that it was impossible to rely upon the prosecutor's statement as to the details of what had taken place between. himself and the prisoner, it being clear that the prosecutor'g mind was in so nervous L state, in consequence of his habit of drinking, and the charge which had formerly been made gainst him, that a word or a look which would be innocent enough to any mind of ordinary firmness might be misconstrued by him, and be easily aggravated by his heated imagination into a charge of the most serious kind, and that this view was confirmed by the circumstance that the gravest part of the statement made by the proeecutor that day he had then made for the first time. ghe transsetions between them had commenced by a volun. tary loon, which had been punctually repaid; and thero was no suffcient ground for concluding that the subsequent dealings were not really of the same character, for both of them were marked by circumstances which would not be
likely to occur if the prosecutor's account of the matter wJs correct-namely, the giving of the written agreement and the check.
Some witnesses wrere eaUle& to the prisoner's characterand, the Ieazne~ndm having summed up, the jury found.
,expressing hs nsetEe of the detestable baseness of the crme which the prisoner had committed, sentenced him to transportation for 25 years.

BOW-STitEET.-JohI MI'Devitt, a young man of sinister expression of countenance, was pbaced at the bar for finaxl examination on a charge of aTtempting to steal a desk and somse articles of wearing apparel from the bedroom of the Rev. J. R. Hartley.
Mary laver, a girl of about 14 or 15 years of age said she was servant to Mr Jane Tozer, who keepa lodginghouse at 34, Bedford-street. The Rev. Mr. Hartley occupied apartments there. About 7 o'clock on Saturday evening she went into Mr. Hartley's bedroom with a candle and observed upon the floor a bundlo of clothes and the writing-desk. She leoked about, and saw a man's legs protruding from under the bed. Without giving the alarm she left the room, closed the door, and placed a jpai aganti
to impede tho man if he should come out. She then went downstairs, opened the street door, and caUed for help. At the same moment the man came out of the room, and, as she expected, tumbled over the pail. He got up and came downstairs, but by the time he reached the door the witness Donovan had come up. The prisoner was the man. Donovan attempted to stop him, but after a struggle he got away. Donovan folowed and overtook him andave him into custody. Witness had not lost sight oi him from the time he lert the house.
Donovan corroborated this statement, In the oourse of his flight the prisoner knocked down a little boy who got in his way.
The prosecutor said that at 6 o'clock he had left his desk on the sideboard, and the other rticles in the drawers. The desk was worth 44,, and contained a considerable sum of money.
The prisonez said he was not the man who had been in the house He was passing by, and on hearing tbe cry of "Stop thief .' he joined in the chase, and,the thief escaping, he was apprehended in ristake.
Mr. JARDINE observed that the witness Lever had behaved with remarkable coolnems and presence of mind. If she ad rn screaming downstairs, as man persons much older would have been foolsh enough to do, the prisoner would, in all probability, have eapgedL He thought her conduct deserved some notice, and he should RiVe her a snall amount from the funds of the court. He should commit the prisoner for triaL
The prisoner on hearing this burst into tears, and continued crying until the depositions were completed, when he was removed.
MAIRLlOnlOUGE-STTr.JacqJes Bois6et, a Frenchman, was brought before Mr. BuiXoH,s charged with obtaining money by fraudulent pretences.
The Rev. LOuiS Choisy, a clergyman of the Swiss Church, residing at No. 3, Fitzroy-street, said, on the 17th of Febrary the prisoner called upon him with a book, and stated that he had been oommi6isoned by a clergyman of La Roche Mouins to collect subscriptions for those who had suffered from the late inundations at LA Roche. The prisoner produced papers purporting to be signed by the mayor of the commune, by 1I. GriDonr the clergyman of La Roche, and a functionary named Deidebert. Bleving the prisoner's statement, and that the papers were genuine oocuments, he collectd for him upwardsd of 344 About the 20th of February he gave the prisoner ., and afterwards two sums of 1, *nd 30s. for expenses. He wished first tobe cehnhteadin o cUbfr giving thewbole sum to te prisoner, and therefore he only gave him small sums a a e. e wrot to the clergyman at La Rochc Moulins, and, hang received a reply exposig the fraud, hegave the prisoner into custody for obtaining money by false protences.
The Rev, Francis Martin, pastor of the French church in London, No. 9, rSeymor-street saidthatonWednesdav last x Choisy ed on him, and told him of the commun
cation with the prsoner. On Thursday he saw the prisoner, and sked him if all the statements he had made on the subject of the inundations were true. The prisoner replied they were. He showed the prisoner the three papers produced, and the prisoner said they were all true. He then showed the prisoner the letters from La Roche Moulins, and told him that the French pastor bad declared that the statements were untrue. The prisoner replied, "I must confess the -whole is a forgery from begnming to end. I did it to obtain money that I might be enabled to emigrate to Americ."o
The prisoner admitted his guilt.
Mr. sUUGUAM explained the law to the prosecutor, If he sent the case for trial It would be necessry to get evidence from La Roche; if be dealt with the case under the Summary Jurisdiction Act, he was only empowered to inflirt a pinishment hardly adequate to the serious character of the offence
M. Choisy had no wish to punish the prisoner severely. He should therefore be glad if the magistrate would deaw summarily with the case.
tr. Bn s,sH. then inflicted the highest punishmentthree months, with hard labour.
WoRKUPR-sTRT.-Robert Clarke, a flashily dressed middle-aged man, stated by the police to be a wel-known skittle sharper, vas charged with being concerned with other men not in custody in the folowing robbery -
A man named John Still had just come up from Glocestershire and was looking about Shoreditch, when the prisoner who at once saw in him a likely victim, suddenly stoppei
before him and expressed much gratification at meeting a countryman who understood country sports. He then told him he was under a wager to throw a heavy weight a long distance, and asked him to go with him and see all fair on his side. This just suited Still, who followed the prisoner to a neighbonrin
beershop, where they ere joined by otber men, and all repaired to the bak yard to witness the feat of dexterity and strength. The yard, however, was pronounced not to be long enough, and the feat was postponed, skittles being proposed instead, the prisoner and another man "going in" at a sovereign a-side, but the prisoner displayed such gross stupidity and incapacity in handing his ball that he soon lost 41 to his adversary, who commiserated
his nllness, and appeared to think it a shame to play with so inferior an opponent. The prisoner, however, was obstinate in going on notwithstanding his loss, and the prosecutor was strongl7 advised to take up the game with him, as he was sure to wiL Still was compunctious about robbin a man who wasa countryman like himel,f anddidnotrelish throwing away sovereigns at that rate; *ie therefore indignantly refused, upon which the skittles were at once agreed to be slow work, and, as all eemed inclined to go Still was asked what o'clock it was. He pulled his watch out to see, and the watch was rapidly jerked from his hand by the man who stood next him and handed to the prisoner, when all made a rush for tho street. Still tried to follow his watch, but was caught by the neck at the door and charged with stealing an umbrella the last time he was there. Still assured the man he never had been there before, and, having with some difficulty cleared himself from this spersion, was at last allowed to go, but could then find neither of the men he wanted, and saw no more of any of them till the preceding evening, when he accidentally ran againn the prisoner in the same neighbourhood and gave~ hia in charge.
The prisoner did not deny being one of the men, but declare e prosector had voluntarily staked his watch against twAo sovereigns on the last game, wrhich he had lost, and that his watch had therefore been doetamed for payment; but the defence was not thought satisfactory, and he was ordered to be committed for the depositions.

Inspector Gernon, of the H division of police, said the wounded man was unable to attend the court, and was in a 'verY weaklY condition. A Germn named Felix, who was
sriously wounded Withx aL knie by a'Swedish seaman, named Henute Holstein, comnmit for tril on Thursday, was lying in the hospital in a very precarious condition. Cases of stbbing and the use of the knife had been very common among foreign seamen lately.
Robert Matthew Philips a broker's man, said he was in possession at a seaman's Loarding-house, kept by a man named Miler of Neptane-street, WeDclose-square. On the previous nignt a man of oolour, named Brown, who lodged in the house, went out and took the wrong hat aud put it onhis head, Brown soon afterwards ieturned and said le had made a mistak-e and looked for his own hat. Directly afterwards both prisoners rushed into the room ad bqan swearing -ad abusing Brown. Macdonald seized

which proceeded from a severe wound in the left groin, The man was at home, and could not be moved.
Macdonald, on being asked if he had any questions to put to the witness Phillips, said thatBrown struck a man belonging to the ship Victorn in Ratcliff-highway. He had no knife at all on Thursday night.
Mr. SELr-Are you English or American sailors?
Macdonald.-Americans. I belong to the New York packet-ahip Cornelius Grinnell.
Mr. S1uf i.-Have either of you any 'witnesses to call on your behalf?
The prisoners replied in the negative.
Mr. John Comley, surgeon, of No. 71, Higb-rtreet, Whitechapel, said he was called upon to see the wounded man Brown on Thursday night. There was a severe incised wound on the left groin, three inches in length and an inch in depth, producing great loss of blood. The wound was a dangerous one, close to the femoral artery, and the fibre of the muscles was cut through. The man was at home, and, thtolugh not inimmediate danger, could not be removed for
Mr. SXLF.-Could the wound have been inflicted with the knife before you?
Mdr. Comley.-Certainly, Sir; the knife in my hand is no doubt the instrument with which the wound was inflicted.
Mr. SrEFE remanded the prisoners for a week.
SOuHWARK.-Joseph Johnson, a carrier residing at Uxbridge, was summoned before Mr. ComEn, at the in. stance of Mfr. Wemyss, the superintendent of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, for cruelly working a horse unfit for use.
Smith, one of the society's officers, said that on Friday afternoon, the 13th ult., he saw the defendant with a van, heavily laden with bas of wool, drawn by three horses. One of them trembled so much that he was induced to go and look at it. On lifting the collar he perceived a very bad open wound about three inches in circumference, There were likewise other wounds, and if his worship would only look at it, he was positive he would pronounce it unfit forany further labour. The other horses were also in a bad state, and unfit for work.
Mr. Wemyss informed his worship that the defendant had been fined at Mrlborough-street 5. and at Hlammer. smith 31., for similar offences.
Mr. CoAuBE proceeded to the yard at the rear of the court and looked at the animal, which he at once stated to be unfit for work, and asked the defendant whether he would conent to have itkfielle. AfterBome little hesitationL he conrented, and Smith, the officer, was directed to see the order carried out. On his return into court his worship cantioned the defendant as to working the other horses in the condition stated by the witness, and muloted him in the costs, which were immediately paid. His worship also told him had he not consented to have the horse slaughtered he should have committed hhin to prison without a fine.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TDES.
Sir,-In the telegraphic summary of the intelligence brought by the present Overland ail, pubished in Thie Tmis of this day,ye regret to find there is no mention made of the arrival at any of the Eastern ports of the Australian nails, which are due in London, vati Marseilles on the 16th inst., under the new postal contract with tbe European and Australian Royal Miul Company. As it is scarcely possible the can now amTve within the contract time and along WtK the Indian letters, I am desirous of learninz if this company have made such arrangements that, on the arrival at Ceylor of the steamer from Australia, her mails and passengers shall be at once forvarded to their respective destinations ? In other words, are they dependent or not on the steamers belonging to the Peninsular and Oriental Company which carry the usual fortnightly India mails between CevIon and Suez t If they are, there is little doubt that it wil bo about the end of the month before the Australian despatches come to hand.
s the question I have put is one of very great imnportance to the commercial public generally, perhaps the European and Australin Royal aidl Company will he good enough to answer it through the medium of your columns.

'tA. summary of the foUowing, received by electric tele. 'graph, appeared in our second edition of yesterday:-]
LIVERPOOI, MARCH 13, 1 By the arrival this morning of the Montreal Ocean Steamship Company's screw steamship Anglo-
Saxon, MrMaster commander, from Portland, we i are in the receipt of advices from New York to the I 28th ult.
The President had signed the Submarine Telegraph Bill, and the parties interested were making arrangements and completing the contract with the 4Goverument.
In the Senate, upon the taking of the House Tariff Bill, Mr. Hunter's (of Virginia) motion reducing the rates of the present tariff 20 per cent., subject to the adoption of an amendment, placing raw wool at 23 per cent., and that of 20c. a-pound or less free, was adopted by a majority of 21. The Bill, as passed, provides that on and after the lst of Julyne.xt ad valorem duties shall be imposed in lieu of those now imposed on goods, wares, and merchandise imported from abroad into the United States, as follows:-
"Oils.-Palm and cocoanut, lao spirits, lac sulphur, lampblack, litharge, and Prussian blue, and articles in a crude state used in dyeing and tanning, and not otherwise provided for; brimstone, crude, in bulk, cream tartar extracts, indigo extracts, snd decoctions of logwood and other dyewoods not otherwise provided for; extracts of madder, vanilla, soda ash, cudbear wood, or pasbel or chloride of lime, indigo, cochineal, citric, muriatic, white and yeUow nitric, oxalio, pyroligneous, and tartaric, and all other acids of every description used for chymical, medical, or mann. facturing purposes, and not otherwise provided for, shall -be transferred to schedule H; and berries, nuts, flowers, plants, and vegetables used exclusively in dyeing, or composing dyes, but no article shall be classed as such that has undergone any manufacture.
"'Upon articles enumerated in schedule A and B of the Act of 1846 a duty of 30 per cent. ; upon those enumerated in schedules C, D, E, F, G, and H, the duties of 23, 19, 15, 12, 8, and 4 per cent. respectively, with such exceptions as are hereinafter made, and aU articles so imported as aforesaid, and not enumerated in said schedules, and not in schedule I, shaU pay a duty of 15 per cent.
" Manufactures composed wholly of cotton, and not otherwise provided for, and delaines shall be transferred to schedule C; blankets of all kinds to schedule D; guns, copal, and salt to schedule G; jute, manilla, sesal gross, coal, and other vegetable substances manufactured, and not otherwise provided for, Peruvian bark, Brazil wood, stones, or unwrought copper in pigs or bars, or when old and fit only to be manufactured; codila, or tow of hemp or flax, silk, raw, with or without the gum, imported in the condition in which it comes from the cocoon, not being doubled, twisted, or advanced in manufacture in any way; fruit and vegetables, green or ripe, not otherwise provided for, linseed, garden seeds, and all other seeds for agrcultural, horticultural, and manufacturing, and medical purposes, not otherwise provided for ; madder root, madder ground or prepared, ice, guano, cameos, mosaic, diaunonds, pearls, rubies, and other precious stones not set, and animals of all kinds shall be transferred to schedule I; and sheep wool manufactured of the value of 20c. per lb. or less at the port of exportation; and hair or alpaca, goat and other like animals al unmanufactured, shal be transferred to schedule I, provided any wool of such animals which shall be imported in any other condition than the ordinary condition as now and heretofore practised, or which shall be changed in its character for the purpose of evading the duty, or which shaU be reduced in value by the
intentional admixture of dirt or any foreign substance to ' 20c. per lb. or less, shall be subject to pay a duty of 23 per cent. ad ralorem, anything in this act to the contrary notwithstanding.
"Section 3 provides that goods in the public stores on the 1st of July shaU be subject to no other duty than if the same had been imported after that day.
au Section 4 provides that on entry of goods imported on and after that time the decision of the Collector of Customs as to their liability or exemption shall be final and conelusive, unless exception be taken to the same in the usual form."
MXr. Hunter's free list reduces the revenue directly only a million and a-quarter, and Mr. Campbell's about six millions. Notwithstanding the difference between the two Houses on the Tariff Bill, it is believed that the joint committee of conference will agree on the details of a Bill which will be acceptable to both branches of Congress.
The Senate had passed the Bill authorizing Minnesota to form a State Government, striking out the amendment restrictino, the right of suffrage to citizens of the United S'tates. Mr. Bigler, from the Committee on the Post-office, had reported a Bill to provide for the carrying of the mails from New York to Para, South America, touching at the intermediate ports, and a bill for carrying the mails from Panama to Valparaiso, on the west coast of South America, in connexion with the mail routes already established and hereafter to be established, to New Orleans, New York, and California. And Mr. Slidell, from the Committee on Foreign Relations, had reported a joint resolution allowing Commander Hartstein, Lieutenant Trenchard, Master Morrison, and the petty officers of the steamer Vixen, to accept certain tokens of acknowledgment from our Government. On the 26th ult. Mr. Sumner had appeared in his seat, and been warmly welcomed by his friends.
In the House of Representatives another "scene" had occurred between Mr. Wright, of Tennessee, and Mr. Sherman, of Ohio. While the former was speaking to a member who sat next to Mr. Sherman he was assailed by that gentleman throwing a handful of wafers in his face. Mr. Wright then attempted to avenge himself for the insult by asnaulting his opponent, but was prevented by the interference of the members. Great excitement had 4ensued, and a duel is reported to be on foot. Mr. Sherman alleges that Mr. Wright had looked insultingly into his face, but that gentl-man denies any intention to insult.
The following is said to be a correct account of -the new Mexican Treaty:-
"A loan of $15,000,000, of which $3,000,000 are to be applied to the payment of American claims, which are to be adjusted by a joint commission.
The remainder of the loan is unrestricted.
"20 per cent. of the Atexican Customs' receipts is to be appropriated for its repayment.
" The Treaty also contemplates a joint postal arrangement riA Tehuantepec as well as the transit of that route.
*There is no stipulation for the cession of any territory.
"Neither Congress or the President have authority to contract a loan."
The Union of Washington states that the article it has published on Prussia and Switzerland, should have appearedas "a communication,"and that it was not designed to foreshadow the policy of Mr. Buchanan, or to criticize that of Mr. Pierce, but merely to express the independent views of the writer, who is one of the most eminent statesmen of the country.
Numerous meetings had been held throughout the States for the purpose of expressing regret for the death of the late Dr. Kane, of the Arctic Expedition, and condoling with the relatives of the deceased.
The steamships Humboldt and Belfast had come into collision on the Mississippi, and the fonner had sunk and drowned 20 of her crew, mostly negroes.
A fatal duel had taken place at Savannah be'tweenIMessrs. Hazeabrick and Kicnborough. The weapons used were rifles, and the former received a wound from whick he died next day.
The steamship Illinois, from Aspinwvall, had arTived at New York with the Californian mails of the 5th idt. and $1,170,000. A Committee of the Legislature had reported that $124,000 had been taken from the Treasury. IThe treasurer aoeounted for the disappearance by exhibiting a bond by the Pacific Expreeg Company to pay next July intereat -on the State debt. The va&l-
iy of -the bond wag questi-o-ne-d, as it aia not acknowledge the reoeipt of the money. The treasurer had been 'called om to give additional security for money -in dis keeping, and propositions to impeach himn were before the Legislature. At a meeting of citizens of Mariposa County it had been resolved to -resist Frerzont's dairm to the Mar iposa
Iract. Iowa Hiue, Placer County, had been nearly destroyed by fire; loss, .g20,0Q0. Mexican bandits 'were devastating the-sout:hern oounties and murdering the inhabitants; bhe4beriff and three constables who went to protect the izhabitaats were murdered.
'The Legislature had appepriatec. $5,000 to assist in extermin3ting robbers. The recent earthquake
in California had ecaMeed tke groand to open ten feet wide for many inies in *e southern part of the State.
The steamerColunabus had aTnived at Panama with -Advices from Costa Riea to ti4e 6th of February.
,She had 12 deserters from Walker's army. The
a'-ptain reported that the allied quadrot had captsired a schooner while conveyiug supplies to WaLker. The schooner was taken to La Union,
-where the captain and crew we re detained as pri-
soners of war. The former was to besent to Guate-
mala for trial. The port of Trinidad, or San Juan River, was oe^upied by 400 Costa Rieans, wellarmed and provisioned, Rumours were current that 180 Filibulsters, with p, smnall steamer and 18 boats, were about to 4ttaok TrLiudad. The latest a ucolnt§ state'
that on the 29th of January a few shots were exchanged, and the steamer retired. The forces of the allies were getting ready to go down the river in search of her. In the actions of the 27th and 29th of January the Costa Ricans lost 60 kiUled and wounded.
At Puget Sound the Indians had returned, and were threatening hostilities. At Oregon there had been great suffering from cold. Many cattle had died from starvation, and the soldiers at Fort Walls Walla had been reduced to half rations.
Dates from St. Louis of the 25th ult. state that the Jefferson city correspondent of the St. Louis Democrat learnt by passengers from Kansas that a difficulty had occurred between Governor Geary and a man named Sherrod, growing out of the former refusing to appoint the latter to the office of sheriff as desired by the Legislature, and which had a fatal termination. Sherrod had avowed the purpose of killing Governor Geary, and, meeting him in the street, spat in his face. Governor Geary did not resent the insult, but his friends got up an indignation meeting on Thursday, the 19th. Sheriff Jones, Sherrod, and others attempted to interrupt the meeting, and in the affray Sherrod shot Mr. Sheppard, one of Governor Geary's friends, four times, and wounded two others. Mr. Jones, Governor Gearg's secretary, thereupon shot Sherrod through the head, killing him instantly. Great excitement prevailed at Lecompton, and a general fight was anticipated. Governor Geary's residence was guarded by United States' troops. Sherrod is stated to be the man who was appointed by the Court to fil the vacancy occasioned by Sheriff Jones's resignation, and to whom Governor Geary refused to grant a commission on the ground of his habitual drunkenness.
At New York the continued ease in the moneymarket on call and the unselling of "beam" were producing the natural result on a buoyant stockmarket. The market was active and nearly every description had improved, although not to an important extent. Erie opened at 67 and closed at 5Th, an improvement of # per cent. Reading closed at 81i; Central touched 90%, but closed at 90; Hudson River, 27i. The Western Roads were all better. The recent decline in Milwaukee and Mississippi had caused more activity in it, and the sales were at 651 to 67. La Crosse was in demand, and advanced to 73. Michigan Southern was 756j to 76; Toledo, 74*; Galena, 103i; Rock Island, 1031 and 104i, sellers 60. Illinois Central was buoyant, 134j being bid at the Second Board without sales. Pittsburg, 53, &c. Illinois Central Bonds sold at 981, showing a firm market. Others were quiet. State stocks were rather active, especiaUy Missouri Sixes, and prices were better. In exchange there was little or nothing doing, and rates was steady. Cotton was very active, and firm at full prices. There was much excitement in pork at advanced prices. There was a better demand for flour, but low grades were cheaper. W'heat and corn were in better demuand for export. Tobacco was generaly less active.

Memorial To The Late Lord Raglan, G.C.B.
MTMORIAL TO TIE LATE LORD RAGLAN, G.C.B. -A handsome memorial stone, in honour of the late lamented Field-Marshal Lord Raglan, G.C.B., is about to be ereated in Badminton Church, near the seat of the Duke of Beaufort, in Gloucestershire, by Mr. Thomas Gaffin, the sculptor, of Regent-street. The monument, which is beautifuUy executed, is of white Carrara marble, surmounted with miltary trophies, and in the centre is a wreath of laurel encircling the words "Peninsula" and " Crimea." At the bottom of the tablet are the family arms, with the Peninsular, Waterloo, and Crimean medals, and a cross of honour. The foUowing pleasing inscriptionJis enraved on the stone :-" To the memory of Field-Marshal Fitzrov James Henry Somerset, first Baron Raglan, G.C.B., and of several foreign orders, who, having entered the army in 1804, and served from 1807 to 1815 throughout the campaigns of the Peninsua and Belgium as Military Secretary, was privy to all the councils and associated with all the exploits of Arthur, Duke of Wellington, by wbose aide, in the moment of victory, he lost his right arm at Waterloo. During the long peace which that battle procured for Europe, employed succesively in high deparltnents of mihtary administration, and also on important diplomatic miosions, he continued to enjoy the warm faiendship and unbounded confidence of that iMnstrioug leader. After 36 years of such service, when an Englisk army was sent to the East, at the biddinD of his Sovereign and the caU of his country, he acceptel its oommand. At the head of that force, hastily collected, and rn-provided for die'ant war, in conjunction with our Allies, he undertook sa conducted to the verge of -fiial success an operation immense in magnitude, unsurpassed in difficulty-the Crimean campaign. Having escaped the dangers of Alma and Inkermann, and for 15 months of arduous struggle before Sebastopol, with a gallant army, maintained the honour of Eagland, he was struck down by peinless but rapid disease. Nono but those who had experience of his qualities in prfvate life can estimate the affliction of this event to relatives and friends. In aotion chivalrously brave-seroe in adversity and succesg-noble in his address, and lpX1jS in lKiU deaIngs, he acquired and en;oYed to the last tha-respect and confidenee of his allied confederates, the ehniso devotion of his troops, and

A USTBALIA.
(FROM. OUP OWN COmRI'Uq:rn"r I
METBOURsNE, Nov. 26,1856.
Yesterday will be long remembered in the colony of Victoria, and, it is to be hoped, not without pride and satisfaction not only by the " native-born," but by all who bave made it their home. The first session of the first Parliament under the new Constitution was opened in person by General MacArthur, the officer administering the Government. The Chambers met on Friday, when the legislative Council chose its President, and the Legislative Assembly its Speaker. The choice of the former fell on Dr. Palmer, who filled the office of Speaker of the late Council with considerable credit to himself, but with the single drawback of being a little too fond of speaking in committee of the whole. Still, he is a man of considerable inteligence, full of information, and perfectly familiar with his duties. No other man in the Upper House approaches him in fitness, and to have chosen any other would have been a disgrace to the House. As to the choice of a Speaker, thero was no man of such pre-eminent qualifications and claims, as compared with others, as to shut out either competition or selection. The choice has fallen on Dr. Murphy, who was for some time chairman of committees, and did his work well. He also sat for a short time as Speaker daring Dr. Palmer's illness. There was another candidate in Mr. Griffiths, who was educated as a barrister, and was caled to the Bar, but has never practised. I should have thought that Mr. Griffiths's habits of mind and manners would have made him a better Speaker. He has more of "a presence" than Murphy, and more cxlm-
ness and dignity of manner. Both are Irishmen, butGriffiths has very little brogue, just enough to give preciseness to his enunciation, while Murphy's brogue is rather conspicuous. Murphy's manner, however, is frank, and he is more accessible and approachable to those who have to communicate with him ; whereas Griffiths's manner is felt bysome to be too stiff and cold, and this last point of comparison between the two, I suspect, greatly turned the scale in favour of Murphy. In fact, either would have been a good choice, and even those who on personal grounds would have preferrod Griffiths cannot possibly cavil at the choice the souse hasmade. There was one curious effect of the experience of the old members of Palmer's disposition to speak in committee; a sort of pledge was drawn from Murphy not to enter into debate in committee. Griffiths declined to give such a pledge, and I think he was quite right in so declining.
On Saturday the President and Speaker were presented to the acting Governor, in order that his Excellency might know on whom their choice had fallen, and not for his approval. Nor were any privileges, such as liberty of speech, asked for. In England approval has come in time to be understood as not implying the power to disapprove, and here the House of Assembly has thus early guarded itself against any conflict with the Crown in case of the disallowvance of a Speaker, by not putting the presentation as for approval. That may be catalogued as constitutional point No. L
The new Houses of Parliament are in a very unfinished state. When quite completed they will probably constituto the finest Legislative Palace in the colonies of Great Britain. The whole design will cost 500,0001, of which the portion now erected will form about one-sixth or one-fifth of the whole. The two chambers, which will be very beautiful in design and embellishment, are barely ready for occupation. Stil they are commodiously fitted up, and there is a good deal of accommodation around them, such as division lobbies, Speaker's and clerks' rooms, some few committee-rooms, and so forth. The library, one for both Houses, will be built next; in the meantime the books will be so placed as to be accessible to members. There is to be a " Bellamy's," and the best cook and confectioner in the town has the contract at a fixed and moderate scale. In Australia our legislators could no more deliberate withou-. " a smoke" than the Dutch burgomasters of Knickerbocker's New Amsterdam; hence smoking-rooms have not been forgotten. At present the exterior of this building is ugly enough, but a large range of buildings has to be added in front, with a facade of considerable architectural beauty.
The site of this building is at the east end of Bourkestreet, the finest street in the city, running east and west through the same. The site was reserved for the puroose when the town of Melbourne was first laid out. Let me remind you here that our quasi-Belgravia is in the east, instead of the west.
To return to yesterday. The ceremonial was conducted very nearly after English precedent. The four judges, in full costume of scarlet and ermine, with full-bottomed wigs, took their seats in front and on either side of the throne. On a stool, supposed to represent the woolsack, sat the Speaker. The clerks of the two Houses occupied appropriate places. General MacArthur was escorted by military, announced by a salute, and was received by a guard of honour. The gentleman usher, though quite new to the office, being a gentleman, did his part of the work as a thorough gentleman might be expected to do it-courteously and welL The House was crowded with ladies in every part, even the members making way for them on all sides. At length, "His Exeellency enters the House" is heard. He had been very well received out of doors, for he is deservedly popular, and there was within the walls a slight murmur of welcome, which would have been loud but for the decorum which the place and occasion demanded, for there were probably few in that well-dressed crowd within who had not experienced the General's hospitality. The steps which followed are well known to your readersThe rnembers, the quasi-peers, are requested to be seated - the presence of the members of the Assembly is requested, they enter headed by their Speaker -the Speech is read. It is the first Speech constructed by a responsible Ministry, and, I think, will strengthen their position before the country-at least, if their performances come up to their promises and professions. No doubt, our Ministry have been disposed to bid high by the election addresses of Liberal members, hub that is one of the great uses of an Opposition.
Leaving the Legislature at the first act, I must now turn to our Supreme Court. The nine prisoners who made an attempt to escape from the hulks some time since, on which occasion Owen Owens, one of the boatmen, was barbarously murdered, were arraigned for the murder last Wednesday. They severed in their challenges, and Melville, the leader of the attempt, was tried. He conducted his own defence, and certainly managed it with very considerable skill. It was sworn by several of the witnesses for the Crown that MelviUle himself beat out the brains of Owens with a hammer, and then threw him overboard. But these witnesses were at a distance, and none of the men in the boat could give evidence as to that fact. AU the other prisoners statedand this was the substance of Melvile's defence-that one Stevens, a prisoner, who had leapt overboard and drowned himself, was the man who struck the blows. If this fact be assumed to be true, it lets in the question whether the kiling of the man was part of the common purpose, or whether it was the act of Stevens without any participation on the part of the others. This point remains for argument. There also seems to be some doubt whether the prisoners were in legal custody at tho time-i. e., whether the practice of conveying them on shore to break stones and then reconveying them to the hulks is supported by any statute or regulation warranted by a statute. If not, it will reduce murder to manslaughter. I think the impression among the profession is that the first point, or rather the very grave doubt involved in it, will save Melville's life. His defence is so remarkable that I enclose it.
Love of display and that sort of vanity which is very common among great criminals were very conspicuous in Melvflle's conduct throughout the trial; but he managed his cross-examinations well, and did not permit his love of display to betray him into virtual admissions, as many old offenders who conduct their own defence often do. His theory of the transaction, so to speak, was kept consistently in view throughout. He admitted he was a villain-he owned he had robbed, but he repudiated so cowardly and cruel an act as that with which he was charged. Some of his disclosures respecting the severe and cruel discipline of the hulks are known to be true, and this leads to some suspicion that the whole, though, no doubt, exaggerated and highly-coloured, has foundatioin fact. This has induced the Government to announce that a commission will
be appointed to inquire and report; and so strong an impression has this Melville's address to the jury made upon the pubiie mind that the public will not be satisfied if the inquiry is intrusted to the hangers-on of the Government, without some men of perfectly independent character.

The Great Northern Railway.
THE GREAT NORTHERN RAILWAY.
TO THE EDIrOR OF THE TIMES.
SIr,-I read in your report of the Great Northern reeting that Mr. Denison stated that I "insisted on Mr. Clark being provided for at 6001. a-year by the Great Northern Company.' This, if true, would be a very heavy charge against Mr. Denison himself; but I had not the influence over the Great Northern Company, and I hope I need not say Ihad not the wish, to foree him and them to commit a Jo . Allow mo briefly to explain how it was that I was A party to inflicting on a man whom I so much esteem as I do Mr. Clark the great annoyance of his connexion with Mr. Denison's company.
I was asked by a gentleman connected with the Direct Northern Comi ny to recommend them a secretary. I recommended Mr. Clark; and that in doing so I recommended a gentleman most fit for such an office has been confirmed repeatedly by Mr. Denison himself, and as lately as yesterday, when te bore express testimony to his honour and ability. In consequence of Mr. Clark's connexion with the Direct Northern I took some very small interest in that company. When the amalgamation of the Direct Northern and London axd York (Mr. Denison's company) occurred, it was, as usual, a condition of the amalgamation that the officers of both companies should be provided for; and I took an-interest, having recommended Mr. Clark to the Direct Northern, in seeing that he was considered, aswere others. Mr. Denison took good care of his staff, as was his duty.
How Mr. Denison's misstatement of this matter could hlp him I cannot see. If he had explained how it was that Redpath, when put into Ur. Clark's place, was allowed to stifle the investigation that gentleman began, three years ago, into the registration books, and which, if continued would then have detected and stopped the frauds, since increased to upwards of 200 0001., he would have served himself better. Without such au explanation his complaints of Mr. Clark, whom he dismissed at the very time he was aboat to render so great a service to the company, are not entitled to consideration.
