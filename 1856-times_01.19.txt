THE LATE BRIGADIER WILLIAM MAYMTE. We regret exceedingly to have to announce in our columns the death of Colonel WilliamMayne, of the Bengal Army, Aide-de-camp to the Queen, andErigadier commanding the Hyderabad Contingent, which unhappy event took place at Cairo on the 23d ult., on his wayto England. He had only returned to India in September last. He was seized during the following month with the ilness which has thus terminated so fataly, and which has cut off in the very prime of life and vigour of manhood one of the most promising and distinguaished officers in the Indian anny. Colonel Mayne entered the service in June, 1837. He was first posted to the 49th Regiment of Native Infantry, but upon the brealdng out of the Affghan war in November, 1838, he immediately volunteered for active service with the army of the Indus, and he zo pressed the matter upon the authorities that he was allowed to do duty with the 37th Regiment of Native Infantry, then proceeding to the seat of war, and in the following month was brought uapon the effective staff of the same regiment as junior ensign. On the4th of May, 1839, he wras present in theaction oftheBolam Pass, and commanded the rear guard of his regiment on Captain Barstow being wounded. On the 28th of Octoberhe commandedthe rear guard of the second column, proceeding from Cabul to JeDlalabad, and was then for the firt time thanked in general orders by Sir R. Sale for his services on the occasion. He was present at the engagement with the Ehyberees on thie 22d of November, and commanded the light company of his regiment, which formed part of the storming party at Purhoot on the 18th of January, 1840. In September of' the same rear he marched with Sir R. Sale into Kohistan, and on the 29th of the nonth he was detached with his company, "the Grenadiers," to threaten the flank of the enemy at Tootan-durr, for which service heivwas specially thanked in general orders by the tajor-GenernL On the 3d of October he commanded his company, which formed part of the storming party at Toolzat, and was again thanked in general orders. On the 18th he was detached to command the main rear picket, when much pressed by tho enemv at the nizht attack at Baboolooshghur; and on the 2d of November his company went up to storm the heights of Pannadurra, andwas noticed in orders. n the same month, having been promoted to the Tank of Lieutenant, he was appointed, as a reward for services performed only as ensign, to the com. mand of the 24 Irregnlar Cavalry, then conmonly knovwn as " Snah Soojah's Horse " and inthis capacity he accompanied Brigadier Shelton!s Brigade, with a squadron of his regiment, into the NZaziam . Valley, was cngaged in a-U the sldrnishcs which then took place, and was thanked bythe Brigadier for his services. Ia October, 1841, he joimed, with a squadron of his regiment, the force under Sir :Robert Sale that was sent: from. Cabul to reduce the Thileees. He wAspresent in all the affairs which took place in the passes during the march to Gandaanuck, and on the force leaving that place to take possession of Jellalabad he, in conjuntion'with Captain Oldfield; commanding the 5th Light Cavalry, completely routed a large body of the enemy who were pressing hard on the rear guard, andwas thanked by Colonel Dennie, C.B., in his despatch reportingthe cir- wnistance. During the siege of Jellalabad he tookan active part in all the sallies made, and was mentioned in every despatch of Sir R. Sale reporting the salme. He wa, mnoreover, almost daily engaged dcuing this memorable siege ia slirmisheswith tho enemy. On General Pollocles ariving at Jellalabad andrelieving the gar'rlon,.in April, 1842, he was appointed Dputy-AAssistant-Quartermastr-Gene1aI of the Infantty Division, and in that capac'ity he accompanied Brigadier3lonteath igAin the Shiininarees receiving the Brigadier's thanks in his despatch for his servicesin the action of the 26th,of-July. -Hewaspresent at the engage. -Went at iAmooltel- on--the- 24th-o.

Writingupon the same subject, lordEIlenI,oroug Says-3 " No young offieer in the Indian army bears a higher character than laeuteant layne.- His courage and gooe conduct in command of the Iregular Cavairy at Jellalabal excited-the admiration of all, and Sir George peUlock particularly recommended him to 3ne, not only as a very dashing officer, but as one who afforded the highest promise of his attaining fature distinction in important oomnmands. I believe it would be very advantageous to the service were Iieutenant 'Mayne to obtain early promotion." In 1843 Colonel llayne, being then second in command o£ the Governor-General's body guard, was present at the battle of 31ahirajpore, when he had a'horse shot nnder him. He wore the star given to the army in remenbrance of that engagement. Having subsequently, on the death of Captain Dawkins, been promoted to the command of the body guard, he was, on the 7th of January, 1848, gazetted as an honorary Aide-: de-Camp to the Govermor-General of Indiav, Lrd Hardirig& kimse'f notifying to him his appoininient n the follovcihx terms.- -There is noofficer in the list who deserves to be tre more honourably thnu yourself, for, if you have outstnipped your contemporaries in rank, it has been, xot;byr fevou., but by. that energy of spirit which boldly tok-advantage of every opportunity which the fortuno efwarafforded to make the performance of your duty conducive to your increase of character as a soldier."' In April, 1851, a Brigadiership in the 2ramans service, now called " the Hyderabad Contingent," having becoe-( aat, rlrdDalhouje thus addresses the Indian Government at home in intimating tihe appoimtment of Colonel 3fayne to the vacant post. After alluding to the state of increasing turbulence then prevailing in the lingdom etV Hyderabad, he says,- " It has been my object, therefore, to find for their comnand an officer of tried ability and judgment, in full energy both of body and mind, and whose reputation as a soldier vill recommend the appointment to theapprobation of the Court. Although there are mnany who. would do honour to the post, I know no one on whom I can. confer it with greater confidence of seeing my selection justified bythe result than on 3iajor W.luayne. HIis experience fully qunlifies hiimn for the post, while the estimnate I hare formned of his ability, judgment, and devotion to tliF. |charge satisfies me that I cannot make a better selection." This command Colonel Mayne retained at the time of his decease. It would entirely exceed our limits wero, we to attempt to record his services in detail in this capacity. Comading about S,000 men of all arms of some cf the finest native troops in India, he vas frequently emploved by the Government to repress disturbances in theDeccan; and in every action in which he was engaged with the Arabs andRohillas that infest that disturbed district ot& India he was eminently succesduL His remarkable activity peculiarly fitted him for such a service. He was wont to. astonish not only the army but his companions in arms bythe rapidityof his marches, on one occasion having marchel a body of his cavalry from almost one end of the Deccan to the other in an incredibly short space of time. He waUs thanked by the Resident at Hyderabad in the following terms - "Ihave to thank you for the expeditious manner i. which you yourself marched from Hyderabad to Alorl; in the valley of Berar, a distance of 360 miles, in ninedays; thealacritydisplayedbythetroopsin sospeedilyreaching the point where their services were required byforcea-d marches shows their high state of organization, &nd I attribute the immediate tranquillization of the Berar dig-. trict and the north frontier to the promptitude displayed, by you and the field force inarxrving soquc2;yat the sceuqof disturbance." r7gs ucl ttese~ On another occasion the Resident thus writes:- You have brought to a satisfactory coneclusion in twio days a matter that has occApied theattention of tholS fs Government for six years, and for the settlemert. of which his Higness the iaym's iorego ar troopshavo shov n themselves entirely insuficient." During the hast four years Colonel wayne was repeatedlythanced by the Governor-Seneral in Council, and on-bi-: entirely defeatinlg a large body of Arabs on the 20th eE September, 1853, near Aurugabad, " the Governor-Gene. Ira2lin Council desired espedially to record his approbation. |of the conduct of Brigadier Mayne, who had exhibited li2. icommand juldgment and skill, and all the soldierly spixia he had so often shown before." He again received the espei thank-s of the Gover . nor-General for his conduct on the 22d of September;. 1854, when he signally defeated a body of Rohillas, 80a; strong, who sallied out from the fort of Sails, near Hyde-.. abad (which he was then investing with his troops), at thedead of night, and endeavoured to force their way through his investing pickets; the result of this msnvre was thei - almost utter annihilation, theBrigadier charging them him.. self at the head of the cavalry. He had with him only 30_men, and succeeded, notwithstanding the darkness oE the night, in entirely routing them. It is impossible to overrate the estimation in which Colonel 3ayne was held generally by his brother officerg of every rank and grade in the Indian army. His ni-.. form success in the field and coolness in action, no less than his extraordinary daring and energy, gained him theconfidence, while the kindness of his heart and manyexcellent personal qualities wonhim the esteem and love, of'' all those who ever served with or under hinL The infiuencer and authority he had over the native troops he commanded were nubounded. Wherever he led there seemed a convictiom, withthem that everythingmust go right, and theyeared. not where they followed him. Colonel Mayne was neverwounded, although he had his horse killed under him Ors several occasions. But dysentery and fever have too surely effected that which the bullets of the enemy were never able to achieve, and his gallant spirit is now at last laid low. Colonel ld:ayne was only 37 years of age. He was tha third surviving son of the late Rev. Robert JEayne, oILimpsflield, Surrey, and great-nephew of the late WlVian Mayne, Lord Newhaven, whose name he bore, and which title(having been created intheperson of the late Lord. has long been extinct. He married iu 184 Helen CunbO daughter of Thomas Davidson, Rsq., of the Bengal Civi!. Service, and niece of zientenant-Generil Sir Robert Con.. liffe,Bart., of A cton, Denbighshire, and leaves Isis sorrowingwidow and one infant son to deplore hisuntimelydecease.-

£ONJiY- ABKITandCITYINTELLI(J¢-WNCe. Friday Evening. The operations in the EngliAh funds to-day have beeu comparatively of a steady character, and they weem for the present to have settled at the improvement of yesterday. Consols for money which left off Lst evening at 89k, opened at 89g to i, and enained quiet until near the afternoon, when there vras a renewed tendency to an advance, and transack3ons took place at 90. Some heavy sales for the account then caused a reaction, and the last official prices were 89i to j for money, and 89- to I for the '7h of Febrary. At a later hour, owing to good quotations from Paris, a recovery of an eighth again occurredL In the Stock Exchange there was full employment for money, and short loans on Governmaent securities were in request at fully 5 per cent. -Yo fresh news transpired to influence the courso of business, but an impression that the Government, irhile they are resolved not to relax their preparations, are disposed to believe that the negotiations comnuenced will go on to a rapid and satisfactory -conclusion tended] to give general stability to the .appearanoe of the market. Bank Stock closed at 08 to 209; Reduced, 89, to 90k; New Three per 'Cents., 89i to A; Long Annuities, 3; Annuities, 1885, 16 5-16 ;Pndix Stock, 217 to 220; Exchequerbonds, 9Th to i; and India-bonds and Exchequerbills, 6s. to ls. discount. There was less animation in foreign securities, but prices generally exhibited firmness. lTarkish wva further operated in at a slight advance, bond _ide purchaaes having increased. Bargains took place in the Six per Cents. for money at 8&k; and for the account at 86, 86j, 86, 87, 86A, and 87. The last r'quotation rwas 861- to 87. In the Guaranteed Four per Cent. Scrip the transactions were at 1 for money, and 11, 2j, 1X, and 1* for tlhe account. It left off 1; to A discount. The other operations comprised,-Brazilian, 100; the Fivo per Cents., 101; the Four-and-a-Half por Cent3., New, 92 ; Buenos Ayres, G5; Danish Five per Cents., 102X; Ecuador New Consolidated, 14g; Greek, 6; Mexican, for money, 201; for the account, 20k, 20, and 19k; Peruvian Four-and-aBalf per Cents., for the account, 76 and 77; the hree per Cents., 53-; Sardinian, 85i, 84k, and 85; Spanish Three per Cents., for accoumt, 39;I -the New Deferred, for money, 22; ; for the account, 22 , X, and i; Spanish Certificates, 44 and i; Mutch Two-and-a-HIalf per Cents., for the account, -64 and 65; and the Four per Cents. Certificates, 96. Transactions in Russian Five per Cents. took place to-day at 100, the nominal quotation yesterday having been 98 to 100; Russian Four-and.2-Half per Cents. were dealt in at 87j and 87, and the Small, at 90 and 88. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rate -upon Paris experienced a decline. WYith regard to -other places there was no alteration of importance .except for Austrian paper, which was in request at improved quotations. In the corn-market this morning business was completely paralyzed, and to have effected any Large ~sales a very heavy fall must have been subanitted to. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the 'week shows an absence of variation until the arrival of the peace news, when there was an advance of filly an eighth and a general indisposition to sell. The closing prices of the French Three per Cents. -on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. 60c. for mioney, and 68f. 15c. for the end of the month, ulhowing a further improvement of more than threequarters per cent. At Vienna, yesterday, the funds ndrauced 4 per cent., and the rate of exchange declined 3 per cent-namely, to 10.41. At Amsterdam -the alterations were of a minor character, but ERussian improved about 1 per cert., and there was 41 similar movement in Portuguese. The 355,0001. in specie brought this week by the 'Australian and Westi India mails has all been pur-chased forFrance. It isthouglit that aportion of the large amount expected by the Champion of the Seas, snow 85 days out, will, if it should arrive soen, be aretair.ed in this country. The suspension was announced this morning of the house of MIr. William Schenck, a respectable m=erchant, encgaged chiefly in the trade with Newfoundland and Holland. Theliabilitiesare supposed -to amount to about 30,0001. or 40.0001., and the -assets, it is feared, will prove small; In the markets for Russian produce to-day there -was a further tendency to depression, and tallow -which yesterday receded to e's. per cwt., is now -S9s. to 60s. The Comnmittee of Investigation of the Eastern Counties Railway have issued their statement -with regard to Mtr. Waddington's answer to their original report. After receiving each of Mr. Waddington's pleas the Committee re-assert the validity of all the cbarges made in their report, and -conclude by contending that the following have been fully proved :-namely that the dividends de'clared half-yearly have been from tmtrue accounts; that the permanent way has been neglected so as to -cause great loss and scandal to the company; that 200,0001. has been illegally lent to the Eastern Union Company; that an attempt was made improperly to cancel a balance of 31,3411. due from the Norfolk Company; that 38,2641., laid ont chiefly on the Norfolk line, has been clharged to the Eastern Cotnties ; that no audit has ever taken place of the stores or locomotive department; that the stores necount has never been balanced since 1851; and, finally, that there has been a loss on this account of nearly 50,0001., which has never appeared in the books. At a meeting of Portuguese bondholders held to-day, MEr. E. Thornton presiding, the question of the ancceptance of a provisional agreement for settling the debt was brought under consideration. According to theterms of the decree for the conversion of 1852, a certain portion of the amount of the claims -of the foreign creditors Was confiscated. Against this proceeding Mr. Thornton and mary of his friends, protested, and refused to agree to the conversion. Others compled, and accepted ihe reduced denomination of security offered ly the Government- on which the dividends Ilve since been paid. Subsequently to the ae-cesion of Dom Pedro to the throne these claims have again been revived, and, in recent negotiations -Wih the Finance MEnister, M. Fontes, a beneficial mrnngement has been effected in the terms of the sau:oined document, in which the whole of the crecitors, whether they have converted or have reftned to"convert, wil be allowed to participate. lThis agrement is based on the onderstanding that Mr. hornton will accept its provisions, and, in enflajction with Messrs. Fould and Co. and Messrm. C,Deauiu and Co., assist in raising further supplies Cx capital to carry out railway and other improvenents ior developing the resources of Portugal. The 4l6irableness of the introduction of the railway .sytem was strongly urged as calculated to effect a mterial increase in the revenue of the country, and -th'chaim-nn stated that he has also impressed upon th attention of the Minister the advantage which -old be derived from declaring Ifsbon a free port. Wii the exception of one dissentient the whole of 1thebondholders present agreed to accept the pro_-v, and an especial vote of thanks was passed to Illfr.thornton for t;he exertions he has ulsed in effeeng this adjustment. Annexed is the docu- nerewith a calculation showing the position of the conv'ted an eunconverted stock, together with the resol ion adopted : "3fTh'ion adopte'D :-- London, Dec. 13, 1855. ."MThornton willaoecept the followingterms, anil illM tecoM=nd the disentient Portugueee bondholders to do the s-I:-That the Portuguese Governnent, in addition 'to the rms of the decree for conversion, dated the 18th of Decemr,1852, givtheholdersofthevariousclsssof stock as undt-on Five per Cent.

The colorial markets this week opened with some flatness and remained with little anmation until after the news of ybsterday, when a better feeling became generaly prevalent. Sugar was materially affected, an improved demand 1being observable, and holders refusing to remize except at higher prices. To-day there was 3 further increame of confidence, and the whole quantity offered was sold at an advance of is. 6d.percwt., while privatelyalarger business has been trasnsated than for some months at, it is said, still higher terms. An inquiry has existed for floating cargoes, but importers are indisposed to realize at present prices. The market closes firmly and with an upward tendency. At the tea sales of Tuesday and Wednesday there was very little activity, and, with the exception of about 2,000 packages of Asamn, which went at lower rates than those realized at the previouis sale, a very small proportion was disposed of, Towards the end of the week, however, there has been more firmness, and some common congous have been sold at rather higher quotations. Coffee has been in fair demand, and the coloury kinds of plantation Ceylon realized full rates, but the common sorts are rather easier. The native kinds are very qiuiet, at aslight decline. A parcel of Neilgherry has been soldat very extreme rates. In the early part of the week rice was in good request, and a fair business was transacted, chiefly in floating parcels, at rather advanced terms. Since the accounts of peace this market, in conjumetion with the corn-market, has become very flat, and a faUl of is. to Is. 6d. per cwt. hlas been submitted to. Saltpetre is also unsaleable unless at much lower quotations. The following statement from the St. Helena Herald of the 22d of November last was made public at Iloyds' this mornig, but without much importance being attached to it: " The bark Dido, Captain Brown, of Cape Town, which arrived here yesterday, reports the following remarkable circumstance :-'Frau Hondeklip, outer roads, bound to Swansea, second day after leaving wfas fired at by a lare frigate; we hoisted tho\e Asecan ensign, when she kept aw ay after a large ship to the westward of uls, .and it coming thick weather we could net see, but distinctly heard the report of cannon.' The c.aptain has every opinion it was a Russian, mounting about 60 guns." Thle annexed is from the Colonial Gold Conpany: p London, Jan. 18. "The directors have received by the Ben Nevis advices from New South Wales and Victoria. The letters from Mr. Spence, the company's superintendent in Newv South Wales, are dated the 29th of September, and advise as follows:- "' At Iouisa Creek we have made but poor progress during the present month (September); after discharging the miners and reducing our force and expenses, I still expected we should have obtained a fair return of gold ; but the constant succession of heavy rains has sadly interfered with our work both in the quartz and alluvium. We have been driven out of the levels in which we were stoping, and all the holes sunk for the washing stuff have been several times ffled. What we have reduced of the quartz has yielded more than the usual average, and some surface soil which we have passed through the pugmill has given a paying return; but I am unable this month to send a return showing, as I hoped, that we were covering our char,gtes. The pugmill works admirably, and if wve have fine weatlier during the coming month, and are at all fortunate in the stuff we raise, the result will be satisfactory. The returns for the month of August, as contrasted with July, show ani increase of 1071. 2s. in the value of gold obtained, and that the expenditure had been 198. 17s. lIld. less. ''At Tambaroora we have recommencedoperations, and, up to the present time, have only passed about 40 tons unider the stamps. From this first parcel we have obtained only about ldvt. per ton, hut it appears that the bulk was drawu from a pile that had been raised out of a feeder of the vein, and v hich could hardly he expected to turn out well. W.Ve are nowv bringing down portions of all the piles raised along the course of the lode, the produce of wvhich will enable uls to form a correct estimate of the value of tho Iarge quantity of ore at grass. *-Vithin the next fortnight I shaU be able to report to y'ou wvith some confidence on this point. Pending some satisfactory return from this quartz, I have stopped all ex'penditure npon the vein; we are merely carrying dovn the oresAichave already been raised at our expense. "'AtBurrndonx the bar has been fairly prospected; seven shafts have been sunki and tried in x-arious parts. In! the bottom of al these the rock wvas smooth, hard, and black, with no deposit of gold immediately thercon. A I little, in fine flakes, was disseminated through the washin stuff, but not nearly in sufficient quantity to pay; we found it about the same on the surface, and in different layers going down, which induced the expectation that the rock would be rich. As it was then perfectly clear that we had been mistaken, and as the operations on 'he river bed had only been sufficiently successful to justify the experiment that v as tried, I immediately withdrew the men, and have since disposed of a portion of the tools and stores; and, in fact, abandonedthat enterprise.' " From Victoria, the advices received from Mr. Coiner are dated SandhuTst, the 15th of October. iHe states that the purchase of theland in the occupation of the company at that place had been effected, that he had stopped all pro. ceedings, and parted with his staffof w,orkmen, only retainingo such fewv men as were necessary to guard the premises until he should have received from ML-. Spcnce a reply to a communication he had addressed to him with regard to the disposal of the company's property." The dividend on the Camden andAnboy Railway Bonds have been advertised for payment. The return frora the Bank of Ehgland for the week endinog the 12th of January gives the follow. ing results when compared with the previous week:Public deposits ... ...

T DB BEPORT, Fridlay Evening SUGAR.-There is mnore general inquiry, and if holders were at all disposed to accept present rates, tlerc would be considerable transactions. There were three small public sales, one of 132 hogsheads and tierces of crystaUized Demnerara low to fine yellow, which brought 43s. to 49s.; also 1,658 bags of 3Mauritius, very low brown, 33s. to 36s., low refining, S9s. to 41s. ; crystallized low middling grainy, 42s. 9d. to 43s. percwt. Theso rates establish an advanc of fullyls. perewt. since thisday week. The demiandforexport is improving, and more business is doing in the refined market. Of West India 250 hogsheads have been disposed of, making 440 for the week. Late thisafternoonl,000 tons of un. clayed Manilla are reported to have been sold on the spot, and 100 chests of Babsa, white and brown. Com.-There was o4ly one public. sale of 100 cases of Neilgherryv which sold chiefly at B7s. 6d. to 72s. Gd. Rica.-The report of peace has had a depressinr effect on the market, and at auction 2,100 bags BangaY sold at i4s. to Ida. Gd. for about good middling quality, wihwas a decline on last week's rates of is. to ls. 3d. per cwvt. There is every disposition to seU on arrival on lower terms, but buyers stiU keep aloof, and no transactions are as yet reported, although it is most probable demand wil shortly spring up at the reduced rates, and there are symptoms of iinqui. Private business was effected yesterday on the following terms, which, however, is notnowa criterion ofthe market value :-200 tons Bengal of the new crop at 15s. to iSs. 3d. per cwt., and a cargo of 500 tons Rangoon at 13s. per cwt. SA.LTrrrE.-Of 980 bags of Bengal at anction, and 900 bags Bombay, the former was withdrawn at 37s. to 38s. for 6 to 2 per cent., and the latter sold at 23s. to 23s. 6d. per cwt. OLS.-Business is suspended consequent on the rumours of peace (with the exception of a few sales of cocoanut, in winh a very heavy reduction in price has been submitted to). In public sale, 28 casks Cochin, and 144 casLs Sydney cocoanut oil were bought in, and 540 casks palm were also withdrawn. TMLmow.-With regard to the general state of the tbade Messrs. Smith and Charles remark,-" Tho result of Count Esterbays nmission to the Emperor of Russia has been announced to the world. It is that the Czar accepts the terms proposed by Austria as a basis of negotiation. A complete panic seized the taUow-market when the anmouncement appeared, and 62s. was at length accepted for January and March. The price then temporarily advanced to G3s. It subsequently decHned to 62s., January and March; and GOs, March and ApriL To-day it has been almost impossible to effect sales in consequence of the growing belief that Russia is prepared to yield mmplicitly to the just demands of the allies.

EASTERN COINTIES The committee of investigation have just issued their observations on>x. Waddington's answer to their report on the affairs of the company. In their observations they fullr adhere to the statements in their repor which was received and adopted by the shareliolders at the f,cncrnl meeting on the 7th of December last, without havInt heard Mr Vaddington's answver. The committee state that they will report, at the ordinarymcetgin February next, on the other duties which were intrusted to them b%- the shareholders at the meeting held in December last. They contend that Mr. Waddington was not the originator of the pence policy adopted by himn; that it was recommend by a ormer committee of investigation a pointed in the year 1849; and that w%ith regard to the Evidends being 2nil when Mr. Waddington rejoined the company in 1851, they say that that state of things had arisen from the mismanagement of Mr. Hudson as chairman, and Mfr. Waddington as depuaty-clairman, from 1846 to 1819, durinn which period dividends to the amnount of 21. 18s. 6d. per a'ase were paid to the shareholders, when onl 11. 6s. Gd. per share had been earned. They adhere to the opinion that Lowestoft harbour is a rmnous undert.ddng to the Eastern Coimtice Company, and that, instead of 14,0001. or 15,0001. havingbeen recently expended on that harbour, as stated by the chairman, they allege, on the contrary, that nearly 60,0001. was the amoint. They complain that a reserve fund for the renewal of the rmaanent way lad not been continued by 3r. Wad- gton, and endeavour to throw the blame upon him for the present dilapidated state of the permanent way. The committee maintain that the amalgamated lines wi require a reserve of 81,60W. per annum. They repeat their statement that the accounts of the stores department are in such a state that it is impossible to determnine whether the defalcation be 10,0001. or 49,0001. The committee do not retract any statement they bad made in their report to the shareholders respecting the affairs of the company, and in conclusion state, they are persuaded in their own minds that they have convinced all unprejudiced persons that the charges made in their report are fu3ly proved, and that their report is founded upon evidence obtained from 71 indisputable witnesses. They contend that the half-yearly accounts rendered to tho shareholders are not true accounts as regards the sum divisible for dividend, and that they should have been greatly reduced; that grat injury has been sustained bythe shareholders in consequence of the permanent way fund having been abandoned by Mr. Waddington, and the proceeds applied improperly to dividend, as proved by the l50,0)001. now required for repairs and renewals; that 200,0001. of the Eastern Countics' capital had been illegally lent to the Eastern Urnion Company; that a balance of 31,341U. due from the Norfolk Company was attempted to be cancelled andthat 38,2641 for works done chiefly on the Norfoll hne hadbeen charged to the capital of the Eastern Counties' Company. The committee do not mention. one word about the East Anglian Company in their ob3ervations. It is evident that some third party fully competent to deal with the state- ients made on both sides, and to ascertain the facts of the case, is required to enable the shareholders to arrive at a proper conclusion as to the actual state of their affairs, OSWESTRY AN]D NEWTOWN. This comp,any has just' appointed a secretary, after some delay, i consequence of the great number of a,pplications for the post. NZoless thanl10i gentlemen sent in testimonials, many of them of a high character. Of this number a committee of the directors selected six, and finally elected Mr. Richard Stephens, of the Liverpool and Southport Railway, to the office.
- T0 THE EDITOR OP THE TnitWPC i Sir,-My attention has been directed to a leniing'article in Thie 27ines of the 5th inst., reflecting ou the conduct E1 Lord lovat, as Lord-Lieutenmt of Invcrnegs.ehire, for having appointed his son, the Hon. Simon rbaser, to thuvaesant lIeutenant-colonelcv of the 76th, or Hiibland.Light Infantry Regiment of 3liftia. Being officialFy connecteoc with his Lordship, I think it right5 without any'attempt ab comment, to explai- one or trwo circumstaz^es 'which seem to have escaped your notice. The militia in nuestion is formcdby the four countieDs of Inverness, lianfi. MSra, ana N~airn; and the appointment of officers is distrilited a noroc the lord-lientenants in these several counties.. Tha Lord-. Lieutenant of Inverness-shire appoints the colonel lien., tenant-colonel, and two captains. To each of thecoudties oe Banff and Moray is given the appointment of one.majorand'. tvo captains. Thesuhite1ns are commissioned i the am manner throughout the four counties. The practice and, I believe, the policy of the--law has been to appoint the officers as much as possible from. their different counties, and to select them from iNmiliesmo3t likey to be influential. Major Cmmuin- has his residenco in Xorayshire, and Major Duff resides in Banffshire, from. the Lord-Lieutenants of which countes their apioinbneuts proceeded. The Lord-Lieutenant of Inverness-shire, there1ore had to look for a lientenant-colonel in his owvn slire. It is right, also, to remember that promotion does.-no£ proceed in the militia in the same way as in the liAe,Xfor.in.the latter no xroperty or money qualification is neceisa y w or all ranks abore that of lieutenant in, tho militia, such qualification is indispensable, except in tha. cases wheme the officer had already served in theline, orhaR been in the EBast Lndia Company's service. The. Hen. Simon Fraser is the eldest5 and, not as you suppose, tlit second, son of Lord Lorat. You will excuse mefor-eddinvW that the appointment of the Master of Loint-has.givc satisfaction in the regiment. I have the honoTr to be. Srr rour obedient servant.

ZONDOG, SATuRDAY, JAHNuAY 19, 1is. Nothing could exceed the reluctance with which Great Britain took up arms against Russia in the alring of 1854. Every feeling, every habit, every nterest of the nation, seemeed to draw them back hom the struggle, and cry, like macsrEN's fancied monitor, " Hold, hold P1 We were enervated by a long peaoe; the whole force and energy of the nationat character were thrown into the effort to mLrove to the utmost a period of boundless and iunexsmpled prosperity, and to accomplish in every -qtuarter of the world those magnificent public works, on the erection of which the present generation has discovered that nations may lasish nillions and be all the richer. for the expenditure. At last we arrived at the conclusion that a military desionstation was necesary, and so we sent out ten thousand men, making the most precise, but,. ,last the most superfluous. arrangementi, for the ixtur of those who were to return no more. Step by step we arrived at the conviction i.at we were really at war, so slowly and so reluctantly did the nationdl mind entertain the notion of this mighty change. But let not Russia, let not any of thowe Powers withi -whom we are iabt to enter into negotiation, suppose tnat the re8dinews of the Eglsh nation to make peace is at lproportioed to its unwillingess to make war. We are in for it now. We have entered the Rubicon, & aive got over the first shock, and are beginning to -isalke our element of that which a, little while to we regarded with the most genuine horror old aversion. The nation is content to make -peace;on tle terns towbidi Russia is reporte to 'ave assented, becausei 1t reason is convinn& that they are 'not ingdeaui~t to seure Ihe immediate objects of the- war, but there , neverthelees, a *trong-smtinlebt which repines at the termination of hbstilities,before we' lave had the opportunity oi putting forth our-whole-atrengt1f, and vindai caig n- iiew field and against a new ellemy our ancient renown. We mention these tling3 for thel v7ery sake of the peace, the preliminaries of which have, as it appears, been'signed between Count VALWNTENE ESTtRIrAZY .3ndaCownt NESSELRODE, 'for in tie preient temper of the -public maind in Eigand any attempt, however sligllt, to rcnew:theb iiplomatic manceuvres of last wpril wold a sult in an immediate exalosion of popular feeling whichl-rnight render it impossible to proceed further in a acifie directian. England, it must always be-remembered,-cdifers very widely from thoe Stages in hich tlhe opinion of the Court and the MTiuiistry- is everything, and the wishes and feelings of-the people are nothing. The most firmly -,established Government - is, after all, only a tiustrd- an -respected agent of the popular will;: ancd is well aware that there are linmits within wb.ich its discretion is as st.ictly confined as if they were laid down by the mo3t carefully prepared instrument. - Russia rnust not imagine that because the- war has - become. a wearisome and -intolerable burden to her it is so to us. The pressure is as yet light, compxared with, otur resources, and there is doubtless at thi3s mio3cent far more popuatrity'to be lost by concluding peace than continuing war. To persons thtus happily situated, and equal to either fortime, it is amisiiig to observe the rueful countenance with2 wlich the organs of Russia gradually tone down the loftiness of their gasconade3 to the level required by the present fortunes of their idol. When the terms that Austria was to propose to Rutssia first became known great indeed were the scorn and indignation of the Nord at the idea that Russia could for one moment listen to terms so derogatory. Then came the notification of the acceptance of these very terms, with the single exception of the ce3sion to Turk ey of the Russian territory between the Pruth and the Danube. .Much trouble is bestowed by the Nord in showllg what no one cau deny,-that Austria never employed the word ;' uflirathm," or used any direct menace to induce Russia to accede to her propositions, and deducing from it wlhat nobody can admit,-that Russia listened only to the inspirations of her honour and her conscience, and was in no degree influenced by the attitttde of Austria. The advocate of a Power which has advanced her frontier a thousand niles in every direction during the lives of persons still living is horrorstruck at thc iniquity of the allies in depriving that Power of a corner of Bessarabia, and convinced that on this point at least Rissia -ill be firm, and that it is impossible for her, at any rate, to accept the fifth proposition, which may involve her in we knowr not what ulterior complications! Well, Russia has swallowed both tlhese impossibilities, and we shall now be curious to see what her apologist will have to say for so unlooked-for a concession. The difficulty with which we feel we have to contend is not the acquiescence of Russia in these preliminaries of peace-, but the obtaining her consent to those general propositions when reduced into the specific elements contained witlhin them in a form so clear and categorical that we may feel justified in agreeing to a suspension of hostilities on the faith that all substantial difficulties in the way of peace have been removed. hlie present period is one that calls for caution, vigilance, and resolution more loudly and more peremptorily than any that have preceded it since the commencement of hostilities. The least relaxation of vigour, the least semblance of yielding to the syren calls of indolence and- ease, will be felt immediately in the clhange of the tone of the n-egotiations, in the resuscitation of abandoned claims, and the persistence in those which would otherwise never have been pressed. The sword of D&srocenrs hanging by a hair is a Etter emblem for the saloons of plenipotentiaries than the banquet-halls of princes. Whenever their eyes are lifted from their paper they should see before them the long array of embattled hosts, and whenever the dialogue flags they should hear the interval filled up with the distant sounds of cannon. Wle believe that we shall obtain peace, and the reason we have for believing so is that to us peace is not indispensable-that we can afford to abide our time and adhere to our demands, without covering internal wealness by hollow bravado, or assunmin a tone in council which we are not prepared to justify in the field. How much the allies have done we learn from seeing how much is yielded, and these things furnish us a scale upon 'which to calculate with Some precision how much, if they be called upon, they are yet able to achieve. MIeanwhile there is one debt of gratitude which even now it is not too soon for those Who assume to represent the public opinion of En&gland to pay, and which duty and inclination alike urge us to discharge. Compare our position now with our position last April, when GLAnSrTOX, GPAHAs, 3nd HERBERT, terrified at the effects of their own - counsels, and unmanned by the contemplation of the disasters for whichl they were responsible, were urging a base and ignominious peace; and when Lord JoN RuSSELL, in the character of Ambassador, was but too faithfully seconding their efforts to degrade and ruin us in the Senate. To the courage, the foresight, the unflinching firmness and unsleeping vigilance of Lord PALaSTON we owe it that we escaped that danger and that disgrace which were so much nearer to us than we supposed, and that we are now in 3 condition to conclude a peace or to wage a war of neither of which any honest English heart will have cause to be ashamed. Such a peace will be a suitable termination to the long epoch of a life devotedwith but little support from political party or popular sympathy to thwarting, counteracting, and overthrowing the designs of Russia, to fiustrating and foiling her at every point, with a firnmess aud pertinacity nut unworthy of the great founder of the liberties of Europe Whose name has just been illustrated by the pen of the most eloquent of our historians.
A lady has been'reudering- her' country a verygreat service.. It waaA service of the most substantial quality -and immeasurable extent. It was not the sudden act of a heroine, who on a fit of inspiration does what other women might have done had they pleased, for -it required a combination of high qualities; 'an affiectionate nature, dignified manners, good position, a special aptitude, and very large experience. It was a service not once for all, for it was an obvious beginning of things and ai example that commanded imitation. It was, in a time of great need, a contribution to the national strength and the mitiggation of a national scandaL The most literal valne- of it extended from England to'a: noble cause, ,and from that cause to the interests of aU humanity. Not a soldier, not 4 statesman, has done so great and- such undeniable service. We are aware that heroines are-in scant favour in these days. They are charged with luck, or ' strong-mainde=dneu, or display; ancd no sooner is one mentioned than a comparison is instituted between heroic and. domestic virtues, rather in fivour of the latter, and with thie nmoral that the heroine has her retward. ' A-comparison of this sort we hold to be as utterly gratuitous and eieeulouis 'a: one betw6enihe Duk'e of ;aVnLnaTOlN tnda labourer wlio hd never missed a day's work-lo-fifty rs audhd brought' up s faily of twelve-chilam without asistance from thle parish or thb sispicion of poaching. Doubtlesi honest HoDGx -.ill be apprecisted and rewaid6d in proper place and time, tst measiwhile we are bound to honour and reward our national deliverer. Without any disparagement to the real hei6iim, of many 3 lady who in spending h'er days in h ipuinng asple.neticp4pi, in doiugith& casiial and thanidess duties of 2i f 3unt unattached, in supplying' the place of !.parent to oirpans, or throwing a ray. of c eerful- 'iss into some other cell of affliction, we wilU do, O,U1' hcit:age tc. one wvhom, In&vi iasTmade great, ! pow-erft-exemplaryjan& illustriotts.' BTht how is it to be done I <Strange to sa;it isj foulxd a question of somne- diflilltsy. We Eave queens lad countes'sas in their O*n right ;- we. have our "miothers iin "Israel"-of a,heterodox pattern; ypt' we are at a I065 how to acknowltedge the services of a lady, and our difficulty is that she is, a lady. There is no order for -her. We' caniot give ,her a palace and an estate, ask her, to found a fumily, be a political chief, and' a centre of splondid hospitality. eVo give. this rubbish to rmen. Prince ALzEaT is said to have exercised his westheti6al tastes in the eomposition of an exnbleniatie ornament for the lady' in question; but most people think that to decorate Miss NIGHTIGALE is to gild refined gold, and even MIr. Smz.-N HERBErT, at Manchester,- hints that such things are here out of place. ' So there is nothing ieft but to invite the lady to proceed in her selfrewading work, and give her the niens -of (jong so. That,' it is to be presumed, is her most anxious wish; and if we could give her half the estates and honours of England-if she is what we taLe her to be-she would be glad to throw them into the box for Scutari or some kindred home of kindness. But if we are to consider the lady's oWn Ltste in the selection of a " testimonial," and invite her to take.an active part in its management, it becomes a matter of necessity that she shouild have what is ealled "her own way" about it. Enterprise and genius have alwvays their own way, be it good or bad. They have their habitual modes of tlhought and of action, their own paces and movements; and you cannot teach them a better or compel them -to worse. A lawgiver of genius will certainly discover the true character of his people, and accommodate his laws to it; yet, never was there a lawgiver wlho did not leave the impress of his own character in his constitution, and go about it his own uway. In any scheme whatever that a platform orator, an ex-Minister, or a pamphleteer might suggest, we might probably see the greatest difficulties; but, if Miss NIGHT11GALE has said what she is ready to undertake and what she believes that shie can do, we will take her word for it. Hers is the faith that moves mountains, for nothimg less than a faith of this sort could have moved tlhe medical department of the army, opened the purveyor's stores, lifted our army hospitals ouit of the nire, and made some thousands of Blitish soldiers bless the day that Miss NiGHT-nGALE wa. born. To vulgar mortal eye there is nothing but difficulties in the way; but everybody must remember that the first suggestion to send lady nurses to the East was received with a cry of incredulity and scorn. WVere there not nurses enough? WVere there not those handy young fellows, the hospital orderlies ? Was there not a devoted band of Chelsea pensioners ? Then, wlhat was there for a lady nurse to do? Incredulity, as usual, went too far, for it took a test, and by that test it was beaten. The lady nurses have frund their work, and have done it. WYe believe they would also find their work in this -metropolis, and do it, withoutt a greater amount of failure than is inseparable from all human institutions. As far as we can collect from Miss NiGoIMNGAES representative-as Mr. SrDNa:Ey HEFmBERT appears to be-at the Manchester meeting, the general idea of the proposed testimonial is an institution for the improvemenit of nurses. That there is much room for improveinenf few people doubt. Were we now to bring any serious charges against the nursing of our great metropolitan hospitals we should only raise a troublesome controversy; but, whoever thinks that all is as it should be in these places would do well to hear what the patients say of the nurses and officers. But, not to speak of our hospitals, there, are few subjects in which the poor-perhaps we should say the rich also-want so much instruction as nursing. The immensely disproportionate mortality of children is chiefly owing to the want of proper nursing at an age when this is everything. MIedical men often say they can do nothing with the children of the poor, because medicine is of no use without nursing; and a hospital for sick childrenhasbeenrecentlyopened, on the veryground that they are not properly attended to at home. Again, in the event of sudden illness in a young and inexperienced household, in epidemics, and many other cases, it is found absolutely impossible to obtain nurses with a good recommendation. The class cannot be said to exist; and the only recourse is to persons nith almost every objection that can be mentioned. lVhen this is the case,-when nurses are so necessary, and yet scarcely to be found, and when it is evident that a nurse can be improved by education, training, example, and experience, it is an inevitable conclusion that we actually want such an institution as that now proposed. We are aware tchat there are several such on a small scale already; but the simple fact that they are small, almost unlnown indeed, proves that they have not the confidence of the public. We have nothing to say against them, for we know nothing about them; and, if their promoters have no other object at heart than the improvement of nurses, they will rejoice at the prospect of an institution founded under more promising auspices. It seems to be a law of human nature that institutions should have their founders and great benefactors, their examples, and, if the expression may be permitted, their heroic age. We cannot, however, help noticing one important omission in the speeches of Mr. SIDNEY HERBERT and Lord STANLE. We could not expect them to enter into the details of an institution such as that now proposed; but we undoubtedly expected (and we mention this -for the sake of Miss NIGHmGAT;nr'herself) that some general idea would have been given both of its conteinplated organization-and of- the provisions intended to be made for its future management. We have reasons for believing that subscriptions to so excellent a work would flow in more freely if the public were once asiured that the institution to be founded by their liberality would continue to be directed by trustworthy and competent hands after its first mistress had passed away. In such a region of suffering-as that of Scutari and Balaldava religious differences might well ba forgotten in the common sympathy of Christians; but it would be more plausible than sound to infer that the same comprehensive system could be successfully adopted in the heart of this mgetropolis; and, if this institution is to enjoy the confidence of the public, its foundations should be laid on a basis in conformity with the Protestant sentiments of the great mass of the oommunity.
Amiong those signs of national regeneration Which I60me:admiirs have. detected in the Turkish. people the progress of scientific acquisition can certainly hold no place. The hMa.hing art has been practised from-the earliest ages, and its triumphs celebrated by the most ancient of poets. In our own lands it caninot be doubted that imnenseopro' gress has been made, in spite of the conventional satire against the destruction of life by the profession, but at a few days' sail from these shores, among a people whom wve call. our allies, and whose riule we have bound ourselves to uphold, it pay be said with' truth that we find the science ' f 3,'00 years since. Indeed, it is doubtfut whetlher the tieatment which PHmoc=Er s received must not haves been far more consistent witl true surgical principles than that which a Bimbashi of OMAR :PAs-'s arny can command to-day. At the beginning of this war the state of the Turlish medical department caUed for attention, both. on grounds of policy and hunmanity. Very little acquaintance vwith the Turkislh capital and army wvas sufficient to induce umen of common feeling to interfere. It was found, indeed, that there: was no small pretence to :profezsional skill. As far as Constantinople or Smyrna wlas coIcerened there was nio cause for complaint. Great cities, with a large and wealthy Eitropean popul ation, with all the wealtlhiest Turks concentrated in their neighbourhtood, were,- of course, amply supplied. French, Greek, and Levantine doctors, fu&rished wiith all the science of Paris .ind Edinburgh, speaking half-a-dozen languages, and .skilful - in treating;'the' local cnmpLaints, weree settled in the capital, and had extensive practice awnong. the various races -wliich muake up its motley society. It wvas, of course, finl vain -to expect that these fortunate gentlemen, tLe trusted of mnighty Pashas, and the wellTewarded advisers of a wealtlhy commtunity, should abandon their ease and prosperity to join in the fatigues of' . campaign. But there was a medical school with professors wvell endowed, if they could get their salar ies paid, and -with a good deal of scientific apparatus and long progranunes of profound lectures. This, at least, ought to yield a crop of amputators and prescribers. But tlhe students were fouiid totally inefficient. In the first place, it is doubtful whether half of them ever understood a single lecture. As the Turkish language has no scientific terminology the lectures were in French, which the miserable band of Turks and Armenians comprehended only in the vaguest manner. These young men were of the lowest class, vithout the hope of ever attaining to a remu|nerating practice, for they knew that no private person wotuld employ them, and only looked to obtain some patty post in the army or the provinces. On tIie Danuibe these neophytes are said to have bled on all occasions, for it is an easy operation, whlile it has an air of proftndity. They administered violent cathartics, because this was the traditional practice of the regular Tturkish ihakiis. Such a course wvas, no doubt, iighly successful in the treatment of ordinary maladies in days of peace; for, as the ailments of the patient usually arose from excessive eating and the want of exercise, he was generally miuchl relieved, and rewarded his physician munificently; but it was |iL-judged where men lived on biscuit and rice, and were worn out with. fatigue and woiunds. The I state of the army and the death of hiundreds whom comion care would have saved at length induced an interference on the part of the British Government. j Witha the usual headlong philanthropy of our nation, it was determined to organize a medical sta9f wh7ich should superintend tle treatment of the Turkish soldiers. The history of this institution was given in ouir columns on Thursday. The "Inspector of Hospitals i'i Turkey" took up a central position at Eupatoria; his deputies are, or have been, at Varna, Sinope, Trebizonde, and probably at other spots on the Black Sea coast. One o6f these6 gentlemen, we hear, seized- a cargo of invalids, drove away the Turkish practitioners, and cured his patients on every side by main force. But 'tliis seems a solitary example. The inspector and his staff, with more wisdom, as the event has proved, were content with waiting to be apphed to; no applications came, and their occupation is now gone, if it ever existed. Whlen OsA&rn PAsmt landed in Mincrelia a few of these English surgeons accompanied him. The Mushir, we are told, " wishes them awvay, and makes no secret of " his views." " Their services are contemptu- ously rejected, their utility denied, their position "ignored. They have often been cheated of their "rations, and have had to battle for the means of "sustaining life." " They drag on their exist"ence in hopeless idleness, or perislh miserably of " fever or clholera." If there be good in everything the benefit to be extracted from this state of things is the lesson, that no kindness will conciliate, no example will raise, a race like that whiclh the convulsions of Europe have made our allies. They have no wish for the assistance of English surgeons, and are " too besotted in igno" rance to know their value." The prejudices of the' men are not removed by any exertions of their officers. In fact, this class, generally reinforced from the households of infuential Turks, shares the ignorance of those it commands, while it has jealousies and objects of its own. The only course now to be taken is that recommiiended by our correspondent. Let the staff I follow the example of the inspector and withdraw, or be withdrawn. It has already cost 40,0001., although it has been in existence less than a single. year. It has failed in rendering any service to the common cause, from the stubborn prejudices of the Turks themselves. At preamt "some of the- surgeons are at Sinope, " wvaiting for a hospital which will never exist." We cannot doubt, then, that Goverilnent will think it advisable at Dnce to abandon the scheme. The staff was engaged for one year; that time has nearly expired, and then the institution may come to a natural close. We cannot but think that the object was laudable, and we lament that the resulf has proved a failure. Would that it could be said that ouir other instances of illsuccess arose, like this, from the too sanguine adoption of a high principle.
The late Mr. Serjeant ADI3S served the public with so much zeal and success for so considerable a number of years that it is but a simple duty to offer a few words of respect to his memory. Exaggerated or undeserved praise., is merely insult. W'e will not, therefore, speak of this most humane and upright magistrate' as of a man of great .original genius, of fiery eloquence, profound statesmanship, or keen intelligence. He was agood and sound lawyer within the'limits of his practice, and, as a criminal judge, was well versed in the learning of that department of the profession. Long experience'had increased the natural acuteness -of his mind to such a degree that few men were better quahlfied to deal with the perJuries or prevarications of the witnesses or prisoners'who were brought before him. When We say that, according to his own calculation, he had tried more than 31,000 (prisoners,r it may be well supposed that few men -had wider opportunities of becoming. acquaifited with the- manners and'customs of our criminal population. He was riade Chairman of the Middlesex Sessions in MEarch, 1836, and appointed to the situation of Assistant-Judge-which he held until the day of his death-in the year 18 44. During, this period no magistrate was ever more constant to his duties, although at times he was suffering in such a manner from bodily - infirmity that attendance in his ' place ' on the bench was to him a source of great uneasiness and pain. He persevered, however,. to the last, and did his duty, -it is the highest praise we can bestow. Under these circumstances, it i3 sdarcely matter for surprise that the Middlesex magi3trates, at their meeting Aon Thursday last, agreedtupon a resolution expressive of their sorrow at tlae loas of so efficient a coadjutor. Even the few d4tr-ictora Av.o hung about hia path during life co -dbiit say 'of him that he was occasionallyhasty and impati6nt. Considering the 'prov'cation, he at times received from certain members of the bar who practised' at his court, it would have been marveUous indeed had it been otherwise. .We will not, however, raLe up grievances 'at a time when there should -be but one feeling of sorroiv for his loss. The few who ever ventured to attack the kindheart'e&d old man will have to wait long enough before they find another judge who will extend fowards them thr- saime measure of forbearance and toleration. What we have hitherto said niay be applicable to other men beside Seijeant AD Is. There are many men in London wlho at 70 years of age continue to exercise their profession and to discharge the active duties of life; but there are fewv indeed who throughout life, and ntail the end of it, have persevered im carrying out so' inany plans for the relief of suffergin humanity from .a mere spirit of benevolence and philanthropy.. Seijeant ADJuis bore a principal part in effecting the substitution of mild for 'highly coercive treatment at- the Hanwell Lunatic. Asylum.. In-the same spirit he commenced the movement for Reformatory Schools in tlhis country. He had been horrified -with the frequient spectacles of jilvenile depravity at the bar of his court; and, ox inquiring carefully into the subject, he found thiat the main cause of crime among children was, that they were dealt with, not as children, but criminals The boy or girl oice sent to prison was lost, and it was the rule to send boys and giils'to prison. From this horrible system a steady supiply of cruiinals followed, well qualified to injure the State in eevery department of crime. Against this frightful evil Mr. Serjeaut ADAMS directed all his efforts. The endeavours of those wlho are now attempting topersuade their countrymen that it is a cheaper as *well as a more excellent design to train inp a population to virtue than to punish tlhem for crime will, as ve trust, be attended w%ith success. Ve must not, however, forget that the Assistant-Judge of the Middlesex Sessions was among the earliest and most efficient pioneers in the caulse. Such were the achievements which justify any tribuite of respect whicll may be offered to the memory of Mr. Serjeant ADASIS. We are much mistaken, or niost men upon their deathbeds wouild scarcely exchange the recollection that they had in their day rendered such services to humanity for the more splendid tinsel of ordinary fame.
COURT CIRCULAR. WW- DSO33, SILN. 18.- The Duchess and Princess Mary of Cambridge and the Mahlarajah Duleep Singh took leave of Her Mtajesty tbis morning, and left the Castle attended by .Iajor rurvea and Sir John Login. The Marquis of Abercorm and Lady Lonisa Hamlltona the Mlarquis of Lansdowne, the Earl and Countess of Shelburne, Lord and Lady Colville, and -Lord Ashburton have also taken their departure. The Hon. C. Fisher, Attorney-General of New Brunswicc, had an interview vwith Mlr. Secretary Labouchere yesterday at the Colonial-office. The 'urxkish Minister had an interview withtheChancellor of the Exchequer yesterday at his official residence in Downing-street. Despatches from the Governors of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the Cape of Good Hope, were received yester. day at the Colonial-office.
THE CRIMlEA. We have received the St. Petersburg journals of the 9th and 10th of January. The Invalide Russe publishes tliq folloVing extracts from Prince Gortsbakoffs journal of: the military operations from the 4th to the 14tlh (16th to the 26th) of December. "During thisperiod of time the operations have been confined on both sides to outpost skirniishes. " On the 9th (21st) of Decomber Colonel Oklobjio, commander of the detachment of the advanced guard on the left flank of our position, made an excursion tow-ards the xillage of Urkusta. Wlth this object in view a detachment of men, armed with carbines, and a portion of the 72d cohost of the Militia of dalouga, left the lightliouse in the direction' of that village. This movement spread an alarm in the whole of the neighbouring enemy's camip. Three battalions of infantry assembled on the heights where the Zonaves are encamped with the object of turning the right flank of Colonel Oklobjio's detachment; but he had, meantime, effected his retreat,without having attained his object. " On the 14th (26th) of December, at 5 in the morning, a party of Frenchmen covered -with white cloaks, shod with list, and with cotton caps on, turned secretly the left flank of our advauced line in the pass leading to theEaidar vaUey, attacked the nearest post at the point of the bayonet, without firing a shot, and at the same time blew a trumpet signal, upon which a battalion and two squadrons, with led horses, came down to take the men who had made the attack. " The rapid appearance of our reserves, under the command of Colonel Oklobjio, on the side of KontlerFot-Sala, compeUed the enemy to retreat. Twvo Cossacks aid one soldier of the Smolensk Regiment of Infantry were killed, and three Cossacks were woumded. The traces of blood left by the enemy in his retreat, and the wounded picked up by the battalions which left the heights, prove that our loss cost the French dear. "On the other points of the Crimea nothing of particular importance has occurred; the works of the enemy on the south side of Sebastopol have been discontinued, on account of the severe frost; in general, according to the information gathered, the allies suffer from the want of warm clothing, and, latterly, their hospitals have received many patients with frozen limbs. " From Genitehi it is reported that since the 6th (18th) of December the whole of the Sivash (Putrid Sea) has been frozen over, and that the Sea of Azoff is frozen to a considerable distance from the shore."
lWe have received the 36oni2teur of yesterday. It publishes the telegraphic despatch from the French Envoy at Vienna to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, which we gave in our impression of yesterday, announcing the unconditional acceptance by Russia of the propositions presented by Austria as preliminaries of peace. A Cabinet Council was held yesterday afternoon at the Foreign-office. The Ministers present were Viscount Palmerston, the Lord Chancellor, the Marquis of Lansdowne, Earl Granville, the Earl of airrowby, Sir George Grey, the Earl of Clarendor, Mr. Secretary Labouchere, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Charles Wood; the Right -Hon. R. Verrnon Smith, Lord Stanley of Aderley, the Right Hon. M!L T. Baines, andthe Duke of Argyll. Thle Council sat two hours and three-quarters.: AuT A osoF o -i5r .'

SECONDD EDITIO. . THE TIMM OFFICE, Sftrda* 1oma* JIdPAESS FROM PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris corre spondent, dated yesterday, G p.m. The news of the acceptaiice by Russia of tie Austrian propositions certainly justifies.the satisfaction, the enthusiasm I may: say, with which it -wai received, and which -still continues; and it-nay be consideiea ungracious to say anything whliich would diminish so pleasing an effect. It is much more agreeable to believe that everything ia go on smoothly, and that Russia' wiU start no difficulty in the conferenc2s which I_preswueaillsoon open. We must not, however, forget, in the exultation of the moment, that we have to deal with a Power whose perfidy is on a par with her ability. This great culprit miust be watched with incessant and untiring vigilance. An old offender against the law excites the compassion and forgeivenessof the generous pub- ie 'when he implores a mitigation of punishment by the most affecting repentaice for past misdeeds, and the moat solemn and apparently sincere promises of amendment for the future; but he . is, nev.ertheless, still placed under the sureiUanue of the police. The modHifcationto'the propositions, whichI tr4nsmitted yesterday, willdoubtless be -consideredassuperseded bythe "pure and simple" acceptapee of Russia, but it is not improbable that she will do-her best: to obtain these or similar modifications during the conferences. You wil have :observed that as to the 5th proposition, in. which the allied Powets -eserve to themselves the right of -making-other propositions over ana above the gnarantees, Russia demanded its suppression by meanes of its vagueness, and the discussion onit in a future congress. Nowit isdesirabletoknowwhetherthis 5th proposition iscomprised in theacceptance of Russia; and if it is comprised, does it mean that she merely accepts "C purely and simply" the "reserved right" of the Powers to make undefined propositions, andnotthe pr6positions themselves, whatever they may turn out to be ? It is one thing to admit the right to present a certain proposal, and anotherto bind oneself to accept what is proposed. The despatch informs us that Russia accepts theae propositions as " prelimi-siries of peace." In discussing preliminaries a difference of opinion may arise, which could not in thepropositions themselves. In one of.the modifications of Russia, or, as they have been termed, co7JtferF.ro-postions, respecting the engagement not to crctte nor maintain military arsenals, &c., she adds -on the- banks or coasts of the Black Sea. It may, become a matter for discussion whether Nicholaieff, where her naval docks are, should be considered as on the coast of the Black Sea. This will perh aps be considered too critical, and rould be so if we had any other Power to deal with than Russia ; but it ought not to be forgotten that Russia also accepted, without reserve, this time twelvemonth, the four guarantees.proposed.by the Powers, and then flung them back in our faces at the Conferences of Vienna. In taking notice of those circumstances I echo the opinion of persons wrho are not generallyj Pessimists, and wiho are pleased to look on the fair side of things. On the other hand, it is but right to say that matters have clhanged much wvith us as 'with Russia since the Vienna Conferences; and that, unmder ordinary circumstances, we are justified in considering thlt the definitive conclusion of peace is not far distant. In the first months of 1855 Central Europe was in a: state of hesitation, and was rather hostile than friendly to the policy of the Western Powers. At the present momentRussia finds it, if not entirely arrayed against her, at least seriously divided, and perhaps reiay to declari its refusal to persist in a legradiig neutrality. The attitucde recently assumed by.isstria I stil believe to have done much, and I am this day a,gain assured that Austria has given assurancesthat she would be with usin the field, and 'will be, in case of necessity. It' has been stated that the Vienna Cabinet expre3sed her intention, on account of the mild and conciliatory tone of the reply of Count Nesselrode, not to vithdraw her Ambassador from St. Petersburg in consequence of the non-acceptance of the propositions ; but it is, on the other hand, affirmedthat IL deDuol declared positively to Prince Gortschakoff that he need not take the trouble even of receiving and transmitting the propositions of the Czar, for that on the 18th the whole of the Austrian Legation had orders to quit the Russian capitaL It was, if I am correctly informed, on the receipt. of this announcement, that the Russian Government found that nothing less than an unconditional acceptance would be received by Austria, that M. d5 Nesselrode resolved, without awaiting the expiration of the period granted him, to adhepe, at once purelyand simply, to the conditions of theidtinmt2etu. It remains to be seen whether Russia will accept the details as unconditionally as she has done - the principle. It is undeniable, then, that the situat.on of the parties respectively has nndergone a .onsiderable change since last year. In appearaace, and it is to be hoped in reality, the hesitations of the moreimportantStatesof Europe have been niodifled, but not in favour of Russia. What was ambiguous in the terms previously demanded has been nmade more precise and less difficult to be understood. But while it is certain that the chances of a complete understanding are greater than before, it would still be foolish to give way to an inconsiderate enthusiasm, and to consider peace as in fact re-established from the day Russia announces her acceptaace. We must still be on the watch; and intil the trsaty of peace is actually signed, sealed, and delivered, we should not relax in our preparations for all coitingencies. - The Paris press expresses its views on thl allabsorbing topic of the day. The Debats thui pronounces itself The only, or at least the principal, olbstacleto pace kmas disappeared. Russia at length gives way to the geueral snd pronounced wish of all Europe.

We have arrived, at tle prelni. naries of peace; this is a happy, an immenese faa; w.raay almost say it is the peace ; for at this point we ontot believe otherwise than that the preibnsries of p4ce must necessarily lead to peace itself.

FOREIGN INYTELLIGENCE. PRTTSSLA. (FIMOi OUR OWN CORRESPONDE.M) - ~~~~~BPaRIa; JAo. I,,. In my yesterday's letter I mentioned some of the objections which are felt here to the so-called Four Points, both in their original version and in the second improved, revised, and enlarged edition Mwhich Count Esterhazy has lately laid before the Russian Cabinet, and which has met with such very limited acceptance. There is one point, hoNvever (the fourth), which vould find a most earnest advocate in King Frederic WVilliam for its ownl sake, as they all do in general for peace and Prussia's sake. The alleviation of the lot of the Rayah population in Turkeyandthespreadof Christianityin thoseparts are objects that the King has for manyyears pastfollovred up very unremittingly ; and it is to these desires and endeavours of his that is to be traced the establishment of the bishopric of Jerusalem. From the letter addressed by the Prussian MIinister in London, Count Bernsdorfli to Sir Culling Eardley, as one of the signers of the address forvarded to the King j by the Evangelical Conference that lately came together in Paris, you will have seen the renewed assutrance of the continued interest the KEing takes I in the welfare of the Christians, more particularly of the Protestant Christians, in Tutrkey, coupled with an expression of his desire to operate in this direction in conjunction with Her Britannic -ajesty's Government, and, as it wvere, as an auLxiliary willingly relinquishing the advanced post of honour to our Queen. In point of fact, however, the King of Prussia, although acting lup to all we had hoped and expected of him in this Oriental political question, has, in fact, got a long start of our Queen and our Go| vernment in the championship of religious interests throughout Erope, in favour of Dissenters throughout Germany, of Protestants in Rome (where Prussia has an embassy, a chapel, and a hospital in the capitol itself), and also in favour of Christians in general in Turkey. It wavs .not many years back that the Sultan, at his intercession, allotted a piece of ground outside of Constantinople for a burying-groiund of the Germans; attached to the Prussian mission there is a hospital for the Germans; and for the erection of a church there, and schools attached to it, the population of Berlin has within the last few weeks contributed no less than 50,000 thalers, in consequence of a King's letter, authorizing a collection for that purpose. However insufficient the sum (7,5001.) may be for the end proposed, it is an immense amuount for this population, by no means rich, and that has of late been very heavily taxed for charitable purposes, to give. 'That the endeavours of the Prussian Government in favour of an improved position of the Christians in Turkey by the establishment of hospitals, places of worship, and schools, are viewed with respect by the Ottoman authorities we may see from the circumstance that on the 13th iilt., on the occasion of the Prussian consul hoisting his flag at the consulate in Jerusalem, the Governor, Kiamil Pasha, caused it to be saltuted with 21 guns from the David Tower; the Governor himself, the Mufti, and many notabilities of the town waiting upon the consul to pay their respects and congratulate him. For a long time it was forbidden to the representative of any foreign Power to make any demonstration of the kind in either of the two holy towns, Jerusalem and Damascus; it is only of late that the consuls of the Christian Powers have begun to look upon this prohibition as obsolete and out of date, apparently with the consent of the Turkish authorities. Not further back than 11 years ago the French flag, 'when hoisted under similar circumstances, was insulted and reviled by the fanatical Mussulman population. In connexion with this subject of the interest taklen by Prussia in the Christian element in Turkey, it may be interesting to remind your readers that in the years 1847-8 the Italian architect Fossati was commissioned by the Snltan to repair and beautify the Mosque of St. Sophia; such alterations as were made in it were of course to be mada with reference to Mahomedan worship. The restlt of his labours, showing the mosque in its present state of reparation and fitness for the worship of Mahomet, was published by Fossati in London, 1852. A work, however, of far higher interest, as showing what the Agia Sophia really was in its high and palmy days under the Emperor Justinian, was published here little more than a year back, and one of its earliest copies formed the Christmas present which Queen Victoria made toPrisice Albert in 1855-5. The origin of the work was this :-For the purposes of the repairs of the mosque Fossati had erected very admirable scaffolding, admitting of easy access to the various parts usuallybeyondthe reachof the observer. On receiving intelligence of this, the King of Prussia despatched an architect, named Salzenberg, to Constantinople, for -the purpose of, accurately measunrc and drawing the whole building,forwhich a firman was readily obtained. In the course of the work, however, a most unexpected surprise came to reward the enterprise shown in thc matter. - On the whitewash being removed from the miside of the dome and other parts, the beautiful mosaics with which the Christian erectors of this Byzantine temple had adorned it most richly came to light; the samne with a vast number of decorations,the existence of which, eitherintactorinruins, had never been suspected Profiting by his opportunity, the architect hasmostfaithfullycopiedalathe mosaics and decorations, all given evenfac similes of theveining of thebeautihfllmarbleswhich the mosque contains. The work above alluded to brings the result of his discoveries before us-in a series of plates produced by chromatic printing, that leave nothing for the most fastidious critic to require. Theso plates-27 in number-presentto us the entire Agin Sophia as it stodd in the early Christian timest erected by Christian hands for Christian worship, and deco. rated most richly with ornaments symbolical of our holyrheligion. To gulide him in his delineation of the mosque, restored to its primitive character of a Christian temple, the architect has availed himself of the poem which Paul the Silentiary wrote, deecribing its beauties in a most matter-of-fact and precise manner.. Thislst-menrtionediindividualwas a man, not only of letters, but of high standing at the Court of the Emperor Justinian; his name or Cratlier his title, " Silentiarius," showing that he was one of the small, select body that wvas summoned to council by the Emperor in matters of State emergency, some of whom were alwvays deputed to receive the high visitors abolat to approach the Emperor in formal audience. The Silentiarii were even sometimes deputed to the civil government of distantprovinces, and the title seems n many respects to resemnble the Prussian GCeheime-rath, or secret counsellor, which has, however, not the most distant resemblance in the world to our Privy CouncilUor. The work, as published here, contaims not only a German translation in verse of the origMinal Greek p6em, buit also a very detailedprosedescriptionof the entire buildingand an I its component p arts; it is, I believe, to be foind | at Williams and Norgate's, inLondon. One can easily imagine what an intense interest and sensation this repair of the muosque and discovery of the early Christian decorations must have made in St. Petersburg at the time of its being flirit reported there, seeing that in 184748 the Emperor Nicholas found again a welIcome opportunity to enter the Principalities; first, - for the suppression of disorders, thnen for the THun- garian campaign, and subsequently found a quarrel to pick with the Suiltan about the extradition of thle Thansgarian and Polish refugees-everythinsg exactly as he wvanted it to prepsie the way for the fulfilment of- the prophecy, that in the. year 1853 thle Greek Cross was to be planted again on the Agia Sophia at Constantinople. iDENMARK The Independatnce Bedge publishes the following letter from Copenhagen of the 12th inst. - " Co.unt de Knuth, deputy to the Landsthing, who was Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Cabinet of Miarch, 1848, died two days ago, in the 42d year of his age. By that premature death the ultra-Danish party loses one of its most energetic supporters, for AL de Knuth, who was much de. voted to the cause he had espoused, possessed a very large fortune, and had gained for himself by his noble and generous character many friends and great popularity. His death also deprives the High Court of Justice of one of its members. The Court bein; authorized by its constitutive law to decide on the expediency of a new election when one of its members is incapacited from continuing his judicial functions while a trial is pending, it uwas feared that the eight members of the Supreme Tribunal, opposed to the impeachment of the former Ministers, and who had declared the Court to be incompetent to try them, would have taken advautage of the demise of AL de Knuth to secure to themselves the majority. Those apprehensions, however, were not realized. The High Court inrited the Landsthing to appoint a successor to AL de Knuth, and the Assembly, complying ivith the invitation, unanimously elected its president 3I. Braun. The latter, however, who is a judge in the Supreme Tribunal, declined accepting that honour, to the great stulpefaction of his colleagues. This refusal, which has been mnuch commented upon, proves either the wealness of the accusation directed against the late 3Iinisters, or the pusillanimity of the President of the Landsthing, who does not liLe to find himself at variance with his colleagues of the Supreme Tribunal. At the sitting of the High Court, held to-day, the Attorney-General having deposited on the table fresh documentary evidence against the Mlinisters, the lawyers of the accused demanded a delay of eight days to examine those papers. This delay was readily granted by the Court, which hopes that in the interval the Landsthing will be able to replace 1f. de Knuth." ITALY. The Opinione of Tturi of the 14th inst. publishes an address of Major Pinelli to the soldiers of the 1st Regiment of the Anglo-Italian Legion, in wlhich he thanks them for their gift of one day's pay to the Piedmontese soldiers fighting in the Crimea. "Today," he says,- " Glory and hope are equally shared by aU the Italians bearing arms, and we shaU soon fly to the assistance of our brothers in arms, who have already distinguished themselves in the Crimea, and furnish an additional proof that Italian bravery is not inferior to that of any other nation." The Sardinian Chamber of Depluties voted, on the 12th the estimates of the War Department, the different items being adopted without discussion. On the 12th the Englishl steamer Black Boy sailed from Genoa for Balaklava, having in tow the Norwegian vessel Jacob Kieland; the two vessels were laden with oxen for the army of the East. A letter from Naples of the 6thinst. in the Courier. de Iarseilles says- "The American frigate Sarana, which was only to remain a fewdays at Naples, was desirous to celebrate its stay in our city by a little flte; given to the faithful allies and friends of the Government of the United States. On the 31st ult., after the reception at Court, it was observed that the members of the Russian Legation hastily quitted the Royal Palace to repair on board that vessel to partake of a lunch prepared in their honour. The petty Russian colony, the American residents, and the few persons in Naples who are notorions for their Muscovite sympathies, were alone invited to the entertainment. We are ignorant of what passed there; all we can say is that it it was a real family feast. It appears that the King of Naples is anxious to possess a little Sebastopol in his dominions, and has selected for that purpose the banks of the once famous lakc of Averno. This lake is surrounded on allsides by steep and arid hills, almost inaccessible. It is of a circular form, a Neapolitan mUe, or about 1,800 yards in diameter, and its water is clear and very deep. Now, a AL Quaranta, formerly a civil enigineer employed on the Naples and Caserta Railxway, and who had the good fortune to please the King, and to construct last year a pier for the small port of Ischia, under the very windows of the Royal Casino, on that island, has persuaded His Majesty that nothing would be easier than to dig a canal which would unite the lake of Averno withlake Luerine, and the latter with the Gulf of Baie; and that if once that communication were opened, it would be not lees easy, by mears of a swe combined system of forts, built on the neighbouring heights, to render the new arsenal impregnable. The King, whose taste was flattered by the idea, ordered the execution of preparatory works, that is, on paper ; for at Naples we are rather slow in our operations. Fonnerly southern Italy was called 'Magna Grecia.' To-day that name might be converted into that of ' Little Russia."'

TIIe Ntord publihesthe following as the teict of the despatchwhich ColuntBuoladdressed to Cotut Valentineo Eaterhazy when he gave him the propositions for peace to be takenl by hiAn to St. Petersburg as the aWrafumi¢r- of the allies:- "Vienna, Dec. 1G, 1855. '"The words which your ExceDency has had the honour to hear froma the mouth of the Emperor himself, our august master, must have convinced you anew of the intentions which have invariably guided the policy of His Majesty in the different phases of the struggle whichl weighs so heavily npon Europe. Always faithful to those same principles, the Emperor would have deemed it a deficiency on his part towards his own people and towards Europe to let the present momentpass, when a superior Power bids a truce to the combatants without attempting a supreme effort to open newpaths to apeace,which presents itself as the most urgent want of Europe. " Convinced, on the one hand, of the so-often reiterated declarations of the Emperor Alexander of his readiness to lend his hand to any peace that would not infringe upon ais dignity or Upon tlhe honour of his country, Eis Imperial Majesty felt himself called upon to employ his best efforts to assure himself of the degree of reciprocity that those dispositions might meet with at the Courts of France and Great Britain. His MIajesty therefore deigned to charge me to sound the Cabinets of Paris and London on the subject. Although we found. them imbued with the firm resolution not to lend themselves to the initiative oef nny overtures for peace, nevertheless, to our great satisfaction, we found such dispo. sitions in those Cabinets as to lead us to hope that they would not refusoe to examine. and accept conditions of a nature to offer all the guarantees of a permanent peace, and to come to a clear solution of the question which gave rise to the war. "Ylay, more; we thind; ounelves authorized to express the hope that those Powers, while maintaining in full force the right of presenting such conditions of peace as they might deem suiitable, would not the less be disposed to-day not to deriate from the principle established at the commencement of the struggle not to seek any advantage to themrelves, and to limit their pretensions to the sacrifices necessary to reassure Europe against the return of so deplorable a complication. "Encouraged by these indications, the Imperial Cabinet did not shrini from the task of making itself conscientiously acquainted with the situation of the moment, and to formulate a basis upon which, in its opinion, the edifice of a solid peace might rest. The four points already accepted by Russia appeared to us still to be the best ground to go upon. To assure the work of peace, however, and to aroid especiallythereefs upon which the last conferences were shipwreckod, we deemed it indispensable to develope the four points (principei) in such guiise as to make them conformable to the general interests of Europe, and to facilitate the final arrangement by a more precise definition. " The fruit of that labour is in the annexed document,* which, when accepted by the belligerent Powers, will acquire the value of preliminaries of peace. The sigring of these preliminaries would be immediately followed by a general armistice and by fmal negotiations. " This labour haling been honoured by the approbation of His BMajesty the Einperor, you are charged, M. le Comte, to present it for acceptance to the Court of Russia, and to urge it most pressingly to consider its contents, and to let us know its determination, to which we attach the highest importance, as soon as possible. If, as we hope, our propositions should be favourably received, we shall lose no time in warmlyrecommendingtheir acceptance to the Courts of Paris and London, expipassing the confidence which animates us that they will not exercise the right of present. ing eventually to the negotiations special conditions, except in a European intercst, and in such measure as not to offer serious obstacles to the re-establishment of peace. " We entreat the Court of Russia to examine calmly the propositionswlhich we submit to it. We will not dwell upon the grave consequences which would ensue from a refusal to enter into the paths which we open a seeond time to effect an honourable reconciliation, a refusal which would entail upon itself the weight of an immense responsibility. We prefer leaving it to its wisdom to estimate all the chances. "W e think that we are in this instance the interpreter of the wishes and of the real w-ants of Europe. It remains for us to make an appeal to the elevated sentiments of the Emperor Alexander, whose supreme determination will decade the fate of so many thousands of existences. " His Imperial Majesty wiU take, we entertain the confident hope, that decision 'which appears to us alone of a nature to respond to the real interests of hispeople and to the wants of humanity.

I 'TH URDER IN BEDFORD-ROW. Yesterday 31r. Waley assembled a jury to inquire into the circumstances attending the death of the late 2&r. Waugh. The inquest, after the viewing of the body, was transferred by adjourmnuent from a miserable little pothouse in the neighbourhond of Bedford-row, to the boardroom of the workhouse in Gray's-inn-lane. Here- Mr. W. Fisher, solicitor, identified the body of the deceased, whom he had knownfor upwards of 20 years, having been at one tune his partner in business. Mr. Waugh -was 54 or 55 years of age. Mr. Erasmus Wren, the surgeon under whose superin tendence the body was removed to the office where it now lies, described the result of the post mortem examination, wlhich showled that the ball had penetrated the heart. Mr. Thomas Kent Whitefield, clerlk to a solicltor in Bedford-row, rezpeated in evidence the facts which we published yesterday as to the circumstances of Mr. Waugh's death, which he witnessed. He described the prisoner as a little hump-backed man, but said he did not }mow his name except by hearsay. Mr. Wakley thereupon inquired whether the prisoner was forthcoming, and, on being informed that he was not, told the jury that he had vwitten yesterday afternoon to the Home Secretary, asking that he maight be produced in court. He had done so in order to avoid the necessity of an adjournment, which he feared was now inevitable. The jury concurred in this view, and the inquest was consequently adjourned till the 21st, at half-past 10 o'clock. - The following statement, made by lMr. Henry Sadler Ifitchell, &r. Waugh's partner, was not given in evidence, but was handed to our roporter in court, and as it bears upon the memory of the unfortunate gentleman who has met with so sudden and tragical a death, we append itto the proceedings:- ', Her Sadler Mitchell, of 5, Great PrescoWstreet, Goodman's- fields, solicitor, vestry clerk to the parish of St. Mary, Whitechapel, state that I was on terms of very great intimacy vith the late Mr. Waugh, with whom I was in partLeship for seven years, expiring in March last. " That I was also on terms of great intimacy with his farmily, and was during the partnership a constant visitor at his house, and occasionally so since the partnership. "That I was well acqutaited with the transactions between the deceased andthe prisoner, " That the deceased, as the solicitor for the prisoner and his family, some two or three years ago, instituted a suit in Chancery, and the deceased by his ability and perseverance gained for them an estate worth 3,0001. or 4,OOOt " That attempts were made to sell the property, which were greatly frustrated by the extraordinary conduct of the prisoner, muuchto the annoyance of some, if not of all the rest of the prisoner's famaily " That at le ngth the prisoner wvas iuducea k' dispose of bis share tohsome of his family, ahich transaction although delayedbythe conduct o. the prisoner, wouldhavebeen completedi 3a few days " That the deceased had advanced the prisoner moneys on acconnt of his share, and.had throughout the transaction acted with great kIdndness and forbearance, although hils conduct had be en highly offensive towards the deceased. "That some weeks ago the prisoner sent the decesed a threatening letter, which compelled him to bringthopri. soner before a magistrate; but as the decessed did notpress the charge aainst the prisoner,, the magistrate discharged him upon lns givin an assurance that he would employ another solictor, ane would not annoy the deceased. " That I have every reason to beMve the deceased did not press the charge against theprisonerout of motives of dind. ness towards ham, fearing that if the prisonervwere called nspon to enterimto areogsanco he'rwould uot be ablc to £nd asurety, and would therefore be incarcertd ehp for a considerable time. - rated ple rtp That since this period believe -anzother solicitor has been acting for the prisoner. 4That the statements made by the prisoner, when taken into castody, 'that Mr. Waugh had rained him,' or ' cheated him out of his estate,' and oBservations to the same effect, are entirely false, and I may say that, if ever chent was indebted to a solicitor, the prisoner was to the late 31r.Waugi. "That theueceased, besideahhaving aexteasiLvbusness, was possessed of a large private fortune, and had nomotive in k ing the prsoner out of a s Wiminghe was entitled to.; " Thatl1am mnduced to inle thisetaiteswintout of reapb to the memory of my departed friend, which may beinjured by the statements of the.prisoner,and I say sat, in ton olusion, Ilmow the deceased to have been a good husband, a kdndand indu3gent father, and a generousanadwarm.heatd - friend." -- _
THE WAR IN THED CAUCASUS. ihe Invaltde RRusse publishes the following undor i the head of "News froma the Eastern Shores of the iBLack Sea "- "From the 21st to the 25th of November (34 to the 7th of December} the Turks contmnued to advance slowvly from the river TUkhouitowards that of Tkh6nis-Tskhald, throwing br idges over the streams, and having' to surmount the greatest obstacles, OWM5ngto the mud arcuniulated by the torrents of rain. ",On tl'a 23d and 24th of Nm-ember (hand 6th of December) the enemy made a reconnaissance with cavahdy and riflemen along the whole right bank of tl Tsk nisTsd male, from Oust-Tska6nis-Tskhald to Ehoni. On ,this occasion a fusillade was exchanged at different points across the river. "On the 25th of November (7th of December) the Commander-in-Chief suddenly changed his plan of operations, and commenced a retreat, having probably received the official news of the fall of Ears, and haming learnt from a hard experience the immeuse difficulties attending a winter campaign in the insurmountable mud of Mingrelia. It is asserted that Omar Pasha flattered himself that on his appro.ach from the Tskh6nis-Tskld16 our troops would fall back bebindEutais; but on finding the'wholeGouriel detachment assembled and ready to give battle, he dared not accept it, foreseeing his tohtl loss if he failed. . "This movement without an object on, the Tskh6nisTskhaMl, and the precipitate retreat which followed, considerably disorganized all the means of transport of the Turlish army, the men of -which suffered immensely from want of provisions, warm clothing, and shoes..r " As soon as the retreat of the Turks commenced the Commander of the Gouricl detachment, taldhg advantage of a cessation inthe rai On L the 25th, and a' fall intho waters of the river% crossed the Ts!fhinis-Tskhali nith some flying detachments to support the general rising of the ina. habitants of Lungrelia. "The firt example wasgivenbythePrincesPagava, who ion the 11th and 12th of November (23d and 24th) attacked, near Ontopo, a Turkish Pa3ha, who lwith a .small detach. ment of cavalry had made a reconnaissance on the right bank of the Tskhenis-Tskhale, and was returning to his camp. Prnce AIcxsander ragava, bawing been informed of this, resolved to set an ambuscadc, consisting of 59 volunteers belonging ,lbiefy to the Princes Pagava and Tchikovani, At nightfall the Turkish detachment, on approachlig the ambuscade,'was received oith a round of mtusketry and charged sword in- hand. This sudden attack threw the Turks into the greatest disorder; some of them defended themselves, but the majority took to fight. The body oE Prince Tchona, of the Ottbykhes tribe, and two other corpses remained on the ground. On the Mingrelian side Bourdzon-Pagava 'was wouikded, "On the 26th of November (December 8) Major-General Prince Dadian crossed the Tskh6nis-Tskhal6 with, the an. grelian volunteers, wvho had joinedhim opposite Ehoni, and followed in pursuit of the rear guard of the .retreatiug Tarkish army, taking the direction of the village of Banza. Colonel Prince Schervaschidze, with the Cossac's'of the Line and the escort company, commanded by Princae Gouriel, Captain of the Horse Guards, crossed the river at Ghanyri and ad-anced on Abascha; Prince 3fUkeladW', leaving Ghazati (on the right bank of the Tslih6nis-T1khal6) with the sotnias of the Imeritia iflemen, pursued the enemy by the high road of Ontopo. " These movements led to a series of successful engagements lwith isolated detachments of the enemy. " On the 27th of November (December 9), towards even. ing, Colonel Prince Scherraschidz6, having received in. formation that a portion of the enemy's cavalry had irrived at the village of Serpifti to collect forage, resolved to prevent it. The appearance of the Cossacks and militiameix put the foragers to flight; but a battalion of Turkish infantry, which supported them, opened a well-sustained fire; the fusillade nwas kept up for two hours. Finaly the enemry withdrew upon the main body on the Abascha, after carry; ing off their dead and wounded; our total loss consisted of 2 men kIlled and 6 wounded. " On his side, on the evening of the smie day Prince liikeladzc, second captain, whvo had taken up aposition in a thicket, opened a fusillade on a portion of tho Turkia-h rear-guard, 'which was preparing to encamp on 'he left bank of the Abascha. The Turks were so much alarmed at this attack that they folded their tents and crossed to the right bank, imderthe protection of their riflemen. " On the 2Sth of Novemnber (10th of December), Colonel Prince Scherr'aschidze, having been informed that Skender Pasha had arrived at the village of Scnaki, vwith cavalry and infantry, to collect provisions and arrest an inhabitant who had killed a Turk, sent to the village the Imerisiar cavalry, which had joined him under Major Prince Simorx TsonlolUidze; the Cossacks and the militiamen of the escort formed the reserve. On the appearance of our men at Senald, SkenderPasha fled with his cavalry. As regards the detachment of Turi-sh riflemen who were in the bazaar. taken by surprise, they were in part sabred on the spot, and the remainder fled into the woods; one man was taken prisoner. Our cavalry-then advanced against a count4 honse, to which the enemy had retreated. They were received by a cannon sbot, and Prince Schervaschidze thea thought it more prndent to retire to the heights ofEk. Int this affair one mi'itiaman was Idlled, and the enemy lefI about 20 dead on the field. " On the same day, at daybreak, the Mingrelian volunteers, under the orders of Prince Alexis Tchikovani, second captain, and Lieutenant Prince Alexander Pagava (of the detachment of MIajor-General Prince Dadian), attacke1 a Picket of the enemy established on the river Toboutch - three of the four Tuirks of which it consisted, -were killed on the spot, and the fourth was wounded, but escaped. In themight between the 28th and 29th the inhabitants oE Sakharbedi destroyed the bridge over the Skoria,. which was in the line of retreat of the Turks. On the following day they sent a whole battalion to rebuild it. " On the 29th of November flth of December), notwithstanding that the Tskhenis-Tskhale was considerably swollen from continual rais, Major-General Prince Bagration-Moukhrausly, commander of the Gouriel detachment. ordered a combined corps of Pdfiemen, Cossacks,. and LUeritian Yeomanry tD cross the river. Towards the evening Prince Bagration-Mloulklnusky arrived at Niko' lak6yL " On the 3Cth the Cossacks, having made areconnaissance of the left bank of the Tekhour, discovered that the Turks were retiring on the river Tsiva. " On the ist (13th) of December our CossacLs attacLed a portion of the enemy's rearguard, which had remained on the left bank of the Tsiva. The Turks. protected by their riflemen, crossed the river, and then destroyed the communication, after losing two or three men in kdlled and wounded; one Cossack was wounded in this skirmish. Xeantime, our riflemen, by order of Prince Bagation-'MonkhrauskLy, occupieda awooded eminence near the high read folowed by the enemy ; and when some of their men fell, struck by the bullets of out riflemen, the Turks abandoned the road, and continued their retreat across a swampy forest. To-wards evening the whole of the enemy's army took up its quarters on tha Eholon heizhts. "On the 2d (14th) of December Major.General Princ, Dadian, having_been informed that a smal detachment of Tarkish infantry was a Sugdidi, resolved to surprise it. Withthisintention a party of 260 Mngrehians, having made a forced narch of 75 versts during the night, tool- up towards morning a position at the river Diouma,at four versts from Sugdidi. On the following day, at half-pxs 5 in the morning, the Mingrelians, having approached the town in profound silence, attacked it suddenly at four differentpoints atthesametime. TheTurks inthe streets were immediately sabred or made prisoners, but our Militiamen were Teceived by a shower of baUsfrom the house win. down Encomraged by success, they attacked the houses rith great intrepidity ; but in some of them they met a most determinedxesistance. The most desperate ight took place iua af4 two stories high,where the Princes A-nkidzef, having fired away all their cartridges, only sueoeeded im =Vng the upper story by a vigorous attack Swoed in "After a combat. of three hours and a-halfthe whole place was cleared of the Turks, With the exception of one house; wich was occupied b aWhole company.

The Admninistration journals of course praise it, and the different classes of Opposition journals do not seem disposed to find much fault with the parts referring to the foreign relations of the counltry. The National Jttelligeneer speaks depreciatingly of the position taken by several senators in the debate whichl ensued in the Senate, but a is silent as to the Message itself. The New York Courier and Enqutirer, another leading Opposition journal, praises the firmness of the President and endorses his opinions. The Journal of Commerce has said but little. The Tribunte alone, of the leadinajournals of New York denounces the Message and attacks its positions. Fpeaking of the ClaytonBuller treaty, it says:- " We have already alluded to the fact that Mr. Clayton's asseverations touching the intentions of the negotiators of the Clayton and Bulwer treaty must be taken with several grains of allowance. For our own part, we believe that it was never the intention or expectation of the British siegotiator of the treaty to surrender the protectorate of Great Britain over the Mosquitos. We believe that Mr. Clayton never approsched this topic in his negotiations with Mr. Buhver,knowing full well the poscition which that Minister occupied en that point;* but that lie cautiously avoided it, intending to obtain by indirection and diplomnatic wiles what he knewv would not be knowingly yielded in unequivocal ternms. We have reason to believe thtat MRr. Clayton c'kuclded not a little at what he deemed his success over the British diplomatist, and was not altogether complimentary in the terms he applied to the astuteness of tbat functionary. Mr. Clayton flattered himself on his phraseology in the trea'y, and thought he. had Mr. Bulwer fast on the point of surrendering the protectorate. Mr. Bulwer came with Prestige as a sharp and knowing man in diplomacy, and Mr. Clayton claimed the honour of having quite outgeneralled him. Mir. Clayton believed, or prosef to belEeve, that the terms used by him in the treaty, by which Great Britain was not to 'colonize, fortify, or exercise dominion in Central Aneries.' included her Mlosquito protectorate. *' But Lord Clarendon denies the fact, and denies the intention, with what we believe to be great truthfulness. And he intimates very distinctly that Mr. Clayton knew perfectly well during the negotiation of the treaty that neither the British Government nor Mr. Bulwer ever had any intention of relinquishing theprotectorate. And here we sisi to take occasion to do the lustice to Mr. Webster of saying that he penetrated at once and distinctly the designs of our negotiation, and saw the intentions and comprehended the acts of the British Minister, and that, believing the treaty did not do what it was alleged it did by oor side, declined, while Secretary of State, to take any steps towards furthering Mr. Clayton's and Mr. Cass's interpretation of it. ks betweer,the two diplomatists, -we think it is a plain case of the biter being bit. Mr. Clayton thought he had entrapped Sir Henry Bulwer, while the fact is that the boot was on the other leg. Itwasa struggle for general. ship in the use of terms, which is ever the chief contest of diplomats. Mr. CLayton thought he won, but it turns out but too plainly that he did not. The tre.aty does not ex- c ude and destroy the protectorate, and if that particula r thing is to be done the Job will have to be begun de n101'. A new treaty must be made, and in it the end aimed at must be caLled by its true name." Your attention will probably be attracted to the full report (in the I2tefligencer) of the debate in the Senate after the reading of the Message, of which a telegraphic account went out by the steamer of the 2d inst. It is certainly a remarkable fact to find such unanimity of sentiment cominig from such opposite quarters-from Mr. Clayton, the Secretary of State who negotiated the treaty, formerly a leading W%hig, and now a Know-nothing; Mr. Cass, the veteran iemocrat; M:.Weller,the "YoungAmerica;" and Mr. Seward, thefRepublican. And it is equally remarkable thatt some of thesa gentlemen should have used the very strong language into which they were betrayed. It is, however, deserving of notice that the President received support from all parties in unequivocal language. There are already signs that these declarations were hasty. The Tribunce (not supposed to speak in Mr. Seward's name without authority) says this morning:- ' On their face these demonstrations seem belligerent, but they are really the most harmless of proceedings. Mr. Seward has not yet told us vhether he deems the failure to relinquish the Mfosquito protectorate by England an infraction of the treaty; neither hashe told us whether, inhis judgment, the occupation of Ruatan can be taken to be a Niolation of the Monroe doctrine. The point in that question is, whether its occupation did not precede the assertion of that celebrated dictiom. Yet ir. Seward and the party he representsv illgo as far as the furthest in maintaning the honour and the just pretensions of the country-further, indeed, than any representative of the slaveholding interest will go, when the action is in the direction of provoking the hostiiN of a powerful foreign nation.r The Washington and New York journals publish the correspondence about Central America which accomupanied the MIessage. LJord Clarendon is in error in one statement-that there is no trace of objection to the protectorate by the American Government up to the close of 1849. WVhen Greytown was tak;en possession of this country was about entering upon the most exciting President-ial election ever known. Mr. Buchanan, the present Minister inl London, was then Secretary of State. nder his directions a MiEnister was sent to Nicaragua, instructed to taL-e measures there to prevent "European interference in the domestic concerns of the AmericanRepublics," and particularly instructed that the "title of Protector" was CCassumed" in order 9' to acquire an absolute doninion over this vast extent of seacoast;" and a copy of these instructions was sent to -Mr. Bancroft in London for his guidance. But no instructions were sent to London, directing any actual interference by an American Miniister in these negotiations until May, 1849, when there had been a change in the Government here. These instructions, which were of the most positive character, were prepared by Mllr. Clayton, and were forwarded to Mr. Bancroft, who was then about leaving London for America. Before his return, however, he saw Lord Palmerston, and stated to him the views of the American Governnient, and was informed by him (as he reports in his despatch on that slubject) that the occI7pation of San Juan was only temporary. There wvas an interregnum of two or three months betwveen the departure of Mr. Bancroft and the arrival of Mr. Lawrence, during which Mr. River (on his way to P.ais) had an interview with Lord Palmerston to again acquaint him with the views of the American Government, and to learn from him those of the British Cabinet. Mr. Lawrence, in the second or third interview with Lord Palmerston, again stated the views entertained by the Washinmton Cabinet. It would appear by the despatches published by order of this Government, that at that time more was thought of the ship canal than of the Mosquito Indians; and as the protectorate was looked upon as important only because standing in the way of co-operaton by the two Governments in this enterprise,-it was thought wisest to avoid the discussion if the matter could be -disposed -of in any other way.* 7 ir. Lawrence 'wrote an official note in which he proposed (among other things)- that the protectorate should be given up; and after that the negotiations were transferred to Washington, and ended in -the treaty in question. It was reported at the time that President Taylor said,. when this treaty was first submitted to him for approval, that he could - not understand it and would not sign a treaty that would require another to to explain it. It is evident, from the published correspondence, that the meaning of the word "occupy" was, discussed verbally between the parties. MIr.

27ie EARL of ALBEM-4LE on BEPEFIT bLUEBS. The Earl of AlbemaAe met the agricultural labourers of his district on Tuesday evening, in the National Schoolroom at East Harling, and addressed them at great length on the u'bject of benefit clubs. Benefit clubs, his Lordship observed, were common things; he wished they were more common, for nothing was more creditable to the labourer than that, while God gave him helath and strength, he should lay aside portion of his earnings to provide against any emergency otsickness or accident, and to secure an honourablo independence in his old age. As far as the principle of benefit clubs was concerned, there could not be a dissentient voice, but they were very difficult things to understand rightly. There were 33,232 benefit societies in England; the number of contributors was 3,039,000; the capital was 11,360,000!- ; and the annual income derived from contributions and interest was 4,980,000!. In order, however, to realize the expectations fairly entertained by-persons belonging to benefit clubs, certain essential conditions mnst be comnlied with. Nothing could be more clear than that, in an iimstitution having for its object the laying by of money, it was essentially important that there should be no inducement to snd mnoney unnecessarily. He objected, therefore, to the system of meeting at publichouses. It was quite impossible that the rninous p2rcentage on the savings which was laid out by compulsion for beer could be otherwise than highly disadvantageous to the labouring man. Ths monthlymeetings of benefit clubs were now too often scenes of riot and debauchery, and entailed terror and misery upon the wife and family of the clubman ; and it would be very desirable if the meetings could be conducted as they were in France, where labouring men could take their familiestowitnesst hem. There were more parties concerned inthe question than the labouring classes, and he hopedthat the time would come when the gentry, the occupying tenants, and the clergy would take a part in it. in the parish in which he was the principal laned proprietor the alergyman had set an excellent example by attending the festval of the club of the district. A main defect in the majority of thepresent clubs was, that they were all based upon a uniform scale of payment, and every member paid the same whatever his age might be. This was decidedly wrong, for increased age brought increased sickness, and the young man who wsas paying the same as his senior was carry. ing on an unequal struggle. In fart, clubs founded upon a VEtem of nniform payment were mere lotteries, in which those wiho were sick the soonest and died the youn ert g!ot all the prizeS, while those who lived the longest and had the trongest claim. upon the funds got all the blanks. He recommended benefit societies not to undertake to provide for sickness beyond the age of 65, for at that age the vast majority of men were past their wrork, and it was very diffic-ult to dcide what sickness really wias. Sickness ought only to be provided for so as to make up the defects in a workmlan's time wfhen he wras il and under the care of the doctor for a specific time. When chronic ailments were dealt with the solvency of societies was endangered, w"ithout any proportionate benefit being obtained. An act of Parliament, the t6th and l7thof Victoria, chap. 45, made amnple provision for every kind of superannuation allowances or allowances after death, and, in fact, appearedto mecteverycaseofprovisionfor the old age of the labouring man, although previons acts of Parliament on the subject of benefit societies had only had a mischievous tendency. The Government aunuities granted under the 16th and 17th of Victoria, chap. 45, were more expensive to the subecribing'members than the allowances promised in benefit clubs; but if a man WaS unable to keep up his subscription toa Government annuitythe amount he had deposited wrould he returned to him, whereas it would be all lost in a benefit club. The general conclusions at which the noble Earl arrived were, that benefit societies shouldnotmeetatpublichouses; thattheyshould havea grduated scale of payment; that they should not insure superannuation allowances or deferred annuities, but that their committees should assist the members in obtaining Government .annuities, whichcouldbepurchasedon safer and more advxatagenus terms. He concluded, amid loud cheers, by expressmghis hope that the labourimg classes would consider the subject dispassionately and calmly, and remember the homely proverb-that if they didnotlistento reason she wvas very likely to give them a rap on the knuckles.'
TOS THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The attention of the Manchester Boardof Guardians Las this day been directed to a letter in 2Tie Timea of yes. terday from Ir. Browne, one of Her Majesty's Inspectors of Schools, referring to a para,'raph copied therein from the Aranchce3ei Exrzrnfner, in which the industrial schools of the township of Manchester are referred to. I am instructed to request permission to state, through yonr columns, that, although Mr. Browne may not be " at war with the Manchester guardians on the subject of the industrial training of pauper children," thereis, nevertheless, n great difference of opinion between that gentleman and the guaxdlians as to the character or kind of education wlich ought to be glven by boards of guardians to paurer children And the guardians of Meanchester contended that an industrial education to such children is paramount to what is understood as mere " book learning," which MIr. Brown's reDrts neraUly indicate as of the first importance. Mr. Browns's objection to the detention "of pauper clhildren by hundreds in the Manchester workhouseg' partakes of that peculiar view which he entertains on the subject of pauper education generally. The Swinton schools are capable of accommodating somewhat over l,OO children, including the infirmary departmnent, and at the present time there are nearly 900 inmates, 750 of whom belong to Manchester. Now, admitting Mr. Browne's somewhat amplified statement as to " hundreds of children," &c., it requures considerable modiication. For instance, there must be deducted therefrom, first, the great number of infants, the sick, those under orders for removal, or pass-order to Ireland, and those 14 and upwards, all of whom are ineligible for admission therein. M lr. Browne as been repeatedly made aware that the guardians never contemplatedthat the Swinton schoolswere to become the medium for the mere admission and discharge of the children of all the paupers on the parish books, who, it may be stated, fiuctnate "by hundreds," weekly, in Manchester. That gentleman has also been informed that the course pursued is that of having a monthly list prepared of anl children who have been upwards of a month in the permanent workhouse, which list is submitted to a cominttee, when such children as may be found eliuible for admission into the schools are forthwith disched thereto. And he has further been informed as to the generally short duration of time the majority of children remain chargeable in the workhouse, to which perhaps his remarks more especially refer; and the adisons-and discharges of children at tle workhouses of Manchester during the ast four weekS which have been as follows,-admissions 183; discharge 19 will show how frequently the inmates are changed, and will show also the impropriety of making a strictly educational establishment like that at Swinton a mere passage as it were for the thousands of children ordered into thevorkhouse during the year. Apologizing for taking up the valuable space of 27ze Tiam" with what may, perhaps, be considered more as a local affair. I am. Sir. vonr ohpdient s .o,t -- - JOHC TIARROP.

THE CENTRAL AMBER2CAN QUESTION. The Waietinogton Daily Union of the 3d inst, publishes -the docinentafrom the Deartinent of State, transmitted to Congress by the Peident of the United States, which relate to controversies with Great Britain respecting the proper construction of the Clayton and Bulwer Treaty. Of these papers, which occupy 22 columns of that journal, we subjoin a brief abstract. In adespatch dated, "Departmentof State, W.ashinon, July 2, 1 ," addressed to Mr. Buchanan, Mr. ray states that Great Britain has for a long period had possession of a district of country on the shores of the Bay of Honduras, called "The Belize," the right she hasto hold it being derived from a grant by Spaif, and being limitedto a single prpe, with an express prohibition against using it for any other. "A possession so restricted as to its use," sas Mr. Marcy, "could never be considered a Brit;sh colony. whileshe confinesherself to the boundaries secified in her treaties with Spain in 1783 and 1786, and uses the district or country described only for the purposes stipulated therein, we have no right to complain that sie isi our policy; but when she extends her occupancy by encroachments- far beyond the prescribed bounds, and changes its tenure by exercising over it civil authority, a very different character is Oiven to this settlement; it thenbecomes a new colony on this continent." Mr. Marty declares that since the acquisition of California Great Britain has manifested a more matured design to change the Spauish licence to cut dyewood and mahogany at the Belize into a British dominion, and goes on to state that the character of the British settlement at the Belize is shown by acts of the British Parliqment passed in 1817 and 1819, which exiressly admit that Belize is not a British dominion. " In 826,' he says, " Great Britain renewed in her treaty with Mlexico the special grant made to her by Spain in the treaties of 1783 and 1786, to enter into and occupy the Belize upon the sain terms and with the same-T estrictions asthose imposed uponlher by Spain. The United States; while they concede that Great Britain has rights in the Belize, positively deny that the Belize is aBritish province, or any part of the Bntish dominions ; and in mamtaaming the polcy referred to, they are bound to resist any attempt to convert it into a British colony. .. ' The protectorate which Great Britain bs assumed over the Mosquito Indians is a most palpable infringemnent of her treaties with Spain, to which reference has just been made; and the authority she is there exercisng under pre-, tence of this protectorate is in derogation of the sovereign rights of several of the Central American States, and contrary to the manifest spirit and intention of the treaty of April 19, 1850, with the United States.. - "Though ostensibly the direct object of the Clayton and Buliwer Treaty was to guarantee the free and common use of the contemplated ship canal across the Isthmus of Darien, and to secure such use to all nations by mutual treaty stipulations to that effect, there were other andhighly important objects sought to be accomplshed by that convention. The stipulation regarded most of all by the United States is that for discontinuing the ue of ior assumed protectorate of the Mosquito Iudians, and with it the removal of all pretext whatever for interfering with the territorial arrangements which the Central American States may wish to make among themselves. It was the intention, as it is obviously the import, of the treaty of April 19, 1850, to place Great Britain under an obligation to cease her interpositions in the affiirs of Central America, and to confine hersef to the enjoyment of her limited rights in the Belize. She has, by this treaty of 185P, obligated herself not to occipy or colonize any part of Central America, or to exercise any dominion therein. Notwithstanding these stipulations, she still asserts the zight to hold possession of, and to exercise cotrol over, large districts of that country and important islands in the Bay of Honduras, the unguestionable appendages of Central American States. This jurisdiction is not less mischievous in its effects, or less objectionabletous, because it is covertly exercised (partly, at least) in the name of a miserable tribe of Indians who have, in reality, no political organization, no actual government-not even the semblance of one except that vwhich is created by British authority and upheld by British power. "'This anomalous state of things is exceedingly annoying to the States of Central Amnerica, and but little less so to the United States, for through the Bay of Honduras and across seine of these States hies one of the most desirable routes to our possessions on the Pacific. This interference, it will be recoUected, did not assume a marked character until after our acquisition of Califomia. " Great Britain should be frankly assured that the polcy to which I have alluded, and to which the United States nmean to adhere, is exclusively political. As relatess to commerce this Govemment neither aims at, nor desires, any advantageinourintercoursewithtlhenations on this continent which it would not wilingly see extended to the whole world. "' The object which it is hoped you may be able to accomplish is to induce Great Britait to withdraw from all control over the territories and islands of Central America, and, if possible, over the Belize also, and to abstain from intermeddling w,ith the poltical affairs of the Governments and people in that region of the world. This object is the more earnestly desired by the UJnited States as it is apparent that the tendency of events in that quarter is to give a foothold to British power there, in contravention of the policy which this Government is resolved to sustain. r v " With your ample kitowledge of the facts, it is believed that it will be easy for you to satisfy the Government of Great Britain that it has no right to intervene in the poltical affairs of Central America, founded upon any dominion she can fairly claim in any part thereof, and that no oblgation of duty or interest is imposed upon her to become a volunteer in the matter." Mr. Mtarcy then proceeds to define his views of the rights actually possessed by Great Britain, under the treaties of 1783 arid 1786; and, after giving a summary of a debate which took place in the House of Lords, with reference to the Latter treaty, on the 26th of March, 178s, be thus winds Up his despateh:- "Nothng could be more fatal-not the treaty of 1786 - itself-to the pretensions set upby Great Britain for herself and the Mosquito Indians than this debate, and the vote on the motion to censure the treaty of 1786. The Lords who supported the motion of censure on the Administration for having made the treaty assert, it is true, that Great Britain and her ally, the Mosquitos, had rights before the treaty of 1786, but admit that these rights w ere given up by that treaty. This position destroys the pretensions of Great Britain, both for herself and the Mosquntos, of having rights there after that treaty. On the other hand, Lord Thurlow, in Isis defence of the Administration, denied all claims on the part of the Mosquito Indians, as well as on the part of Great Britain, except what wvas given by the clause relative to the Belize; his position, which was concurred in by nearly the whole House of Lords, is, therefore, equally fatal to these pretensions of the British Government. In one view or the other, the vote of the whole House of Lords is an acknowledgment that Great Britain, after 1786, had no rights whatever in Central America, or in that vicinity, sxcept the limited usufruet to a small tract of counltry-the Belize-not cLaimed .as a part of Central America, and that the Mfosquito Indians had no sovereign rights to any territory whatever. "'The acts of parliament show that Great Britain had no dominion there; none even in the Belize; and by four treaties-three with Spain and one with the United States (that of the 19th of April, 1850)-she has precluded herself from interposing in the affairs of Central America. I therefore trust you wil encounter but littlo difficulty in inducing her to abandon unfounded pretensions, and to respect these solemn treaty stipulations." On JanuaryX10, 1854, r. Buchanan addressed a despatch to Mr. 3arcy, in which he statedthathe hadhadalonginterviewvwithLordClarendonattheForeign-office,whenthenoble lord informedhimthathe hadpresentedtotheCabinetthesuggestion of the American Government that Nicaragua should treat the Mosquitos within her limits as Great Britain and the United States treated their own Indians under similar circumstances. After some discussion on this subject, M1r. Buchanan adds that a discursive and rambling conversation took place, embracing the Ruaten and Belize question, the Clayton and Bulwer Treaty, and other matters, in the course of which Jord Clarendon .stated distinctly that that treaty was, in the opinion of the English Government, entirely prospective in its operation, and did not require them to abandon any of their possessions in Central America. " In regard to Belize," M1r. Buchanan says, " there was not the least appearance of yselding on the part of his Lordship. He repudiated the ides with some warmth thatany person should suppose they had surrendered this settlement under the Clayton and Bulw-er Treaty. The time has therefore arrived -when it becomes indispensable that I should receive the President's instructions on this point. In forming his opion it may be worthy of consideratios that the British have been in the actual possession of Belize, under treaty, for more than 70 years; that no period was fixed when they should withdraw from this possession ; that Spain declared war against Great Britain on the 11th of October, 1796; that an attack was made from Yucatan on Belize in 1798, which was repelled by the Brltish settler; and that for nearly a quarter of a century it has been under a regular colonial government without attracting the notice of the United States."' A statement of the viows ofthe UnitedStates'Government with reference to the various questions in dispute, dated Janua 6 1854, was placed by Mr. Buchanan in the hands of Lord Ciarendon; aud in a lengthy reply, transmitted by the noble Earl to the American Minister on the 22d of May follo ing, he observes that the substance of the case subnitted to Her Majesty's Government by Mr. Buchananrmay be briefly stated as follows "1L That Great Britain, prior to A pril, 1850, was 'in ssessionof the whole coast af Central America from the OEHondo te the part and harbour of San Juan de Nicaragua, except that portion of it between the Sarstoon and Cape. Honduras, together with the adjacent Honduris island of RuaLtan..- "2.

That no claim on the part of Great Brtliin to act in thename or under the authority of the Mosquito Indians couea bred by founded, inasmuch as that race, even if never conqiered by Spain, were savages whi, according to the Practice and principlesof all European ations which had ever acquired territory on the continent of America, had no title to ralik as independent States in the territory they u occupancy thereon, sauch terriory being the dominion of the discoverer of it, or even of the discoverer of territory on the same continent, thotugh far distant -from it, by whom alone this claiin to mnere occupancy on the part of the Iudihns was to be extinguished by purchase, as the advance of the white settlements rendered it necessary. "And fuaUy, that Great Britain, ha I declared by treaty in 1850, that she would neither colonze, fortify occunpy, nor assume domninion over, Mosquito or Central America, was therey, at all events, bound to withdraw her protection from the people and territory of tho Mosquitoeand, moreover4 to deliver up Ituatan, w hich was an island belongingto Honduras, a centralAmerican State, but which, nervertheless,had recently been colonized and occupied by With these positions the Earl of Clarendon deals in a desptch wlhich fillsfour colunms of tho Daily Union. The noble Earl says "that Great Britain has never held anv possessions whatsoever in the Mosquito country, althougl' she undoubtedly exercised a great and extensive influence ever it as the protecting ay of the hFosquito king and that the United Shtes' Govermnent will, it 3s apprehended, scarcely expect that Great Britain should enter into any explanation or defence of her conduct with respect to acts committed by her nearly 40 years ago, in a matter in which no-right or possession of the Uni States was involved." With respect to any right or any interfereice on the part of the Government of Old Spain respeeting the Mosquito Protectorate, Lord Clarendon observes that since the peace of 1815 that Government has never raised any question on the subject, and that no remonstrance was made by auy of the neighbouring republics which have successively risen in America on the ruins of the Spanish empire for manny years after the protectorate of Great Britain over Mosquito had been a fact well known to them; and moreover that those remonstrances having been made, with similar pretensions by several of these republics, if the Mlosquito- Indians were withdracu altogether from the portion of America which they now inhabit, it would stiMbe aquestion on whichof the claimants the territory thus left unoccupied would of right devolve. Lord Clarendon states that Mr. Buchanan is mistaken in thinking that the United States' Government has always contested and resisted the position assumed by Great Britain on the Mosquito Coast, for that although the United States were inforined of the position of Great Britain with respect to Mosquito in 1842, there was no trace of their having alluded to the question intheircommunicationswith Her Majesty's Government up to the end of 1849, and that even with respect to the capture of San Juan de Nicaragua (now called Greytown) the United States' Minister in London was not authorized to take any steps, nor even to afford to the commissoner from Nicaragua the benefit of hiscounsels and good offices thereupon. The despatch says - W With regard to the grounds on which Her Majesty's Government made the capture of San Juan de Nicaragua, in 1848, the desire of Her Majesty's Governmnent to avoid all subjects of controversy in which it is not absolutely necessary to enter restrains it from here adverting to the documents which stated the reasons on which Her Majesty's Govemrnment caane to the resolution it at that time adopted; and, indoed, as those documents were laid before Parliament and communicated officiaUy to the United States' Government, it would be superAluons now to recapitulate their contents. "With regard to the doctrine laid down by lr. President Monroe in 1823, concerning the future colonization of the American contingents by European States, as an international axiom which ought to regulate the conduct of European States, it can only be viewed as the dichin of the distinguished personage who delivered it; but Her Majestys Government cannot admit that doctrine as an international axiom which ought to regulate the conduct of European States. The doctrine with regard to the incapacity of the Indians to exercise the rights of sovereign powers must also remain a doctrine on which each State which has to deal with sucI Indians must be free to exercise its own policy, and to follow the dictates of its own conscience." The noble Earl points to liberia as the example of a flourishing independent State, composed chiefly of negroes fromn the United States, and observes that Great Britain in her own dealings with Indians, has recognizedtheir rulers as independent chiefs, while in her treaties with foreign Powers she has spoken of their tribes as nations, and stipulated for the restoration of their possessions. On these topics, therefore, Her Majesty's Government, without seekingto impose any opinions on the United States' Government, claims a right to hold its own opinions. " The one remaining subject to be discussed," Lord Clarendon continues, "relates to a question in which Great Britain and the United States are both directly concerned, and in regard to which it is a matter both of honour and interest that they should avoid all misunderstanding or disagreement. This subject is the rightful interpretation of a treaty engagement to which (3reat Britain and the United States are parties. " 31r. Buchanan lays it down as a fact that Great Britain held the sovereignty of the Mosq uito coast prior to 1850, and he then states that Great Britain still continues to hold this sovereignty, although the treaty of 1850 prohibits her from so doing. But MIr. Buchanan confounds the two conditions of a sov reeigntyand of a protcotorate, and under this error treaits the agreement 'not to colonize, nor occupy, nor fortify, nor a6ssme nor exercise dominion over,' as including an a"reement not to protect. "'1Vith respect . to sovereignty, Great Britain never claimed, and does not now claim or hold any sovereignty in or over Mosquito; but with respect to the protectorate which Great Britain has long exercised over Mosquito. Ber Majesty's Government asserts that the treaty of 1850 did not, and was not meant to annihilate such protectorate, but simply to confine its powers and limit its influence." Thenoble earl, afterreminding the representative of the United States that the spirit of a treaty must always be inferredfrom the circumstances under which it takes Place, and that the true construction oi a treaty must be deuced from the literal meaning of the words employed in its framing, proceeds to describe the circumstance under which the treaty of 1850 was concluded. He observes that, after expellng the Nicaragnans from Greytown, " Great Brtain could c1carly engage herself to the United States to do all that was required respecting the construction and protection of any canal commumcation across the isthmnus, to be enjoyed on equal ternis by all nations, and she could also limit the powers of her protectorate over Mosquito, so as to remove all suspicion or possibility of her using it in any manner that would place such canal comnuunication under her exclusive authority and dominion. Thus, when the drawing up of a tre.aty afterwvards took place, the object of the British negotiator, and, it must be presnmed, that of beth negotiators, necessarily was to dras up such a convention as, without conceding any specific point on wvhich one party could not in honour yield, would make such concessions on all other points as the other party desired; and if the convention in question be referred to, itwiUibeseenthat it is drawlnupcarefully, in such a manner as to make it a matter of indifference, so far as the canal is concerned, as to whether the port and town of San Juan are under the modified protectorate of Great Britain, or under the government of Nicaragua. 3Moreover, in drawing np this treaty, both Mr. Clayton and Sir HL L. Buiwer referred to the notes which had passed between Lord Palmerston and Mr. Lawrence, and even made nse of the precise terms which had been then employed, from which it must of necessity be inferred that they meant to transfer to their convention,with the words which they borrowved, the meaning which had previously been attached to those words in the documents from whicl they extracted them; and a referenco to such documents will at once show that Mr. Lawrence, while he asked Her MLajesty's Government whether it meant to ocupy - fortify, colonize, or assume or exercise dominion over Mosquito, did not allude to the protectorate of Great Britain over that country, and that Lord Palmerston, in declaring that Her Majesty's Government did not intend to do anyof these things, expressly left the qucstion concerning the political relations between Great Bntain and the Mosquitos untouched." With regard to the literal meaning of the treaty, Lord Clarendon observes that it is evident it clearly aclmowledges the possibility of Great Britain or the United States affording protection to Mosquito or any Oentral American State, and that the intention of the parties was not to prohibit or abolish, but to limit and restrict, such protectorate. The noble Earl further says that it was never in the contemplationof Her Majesty's Government, or in that of the Government of the UJUed States, that thetreaty of 185Oshonld interfere in any way with Her Majesty's settlement at elze, or its dependencies; and he shows in some detail that the pretensions of Great Britain to consider Ruatan and Bonacea dependencies of Belize were of long standin, and existed certainly at the period of the treaty of 185g The following are the concluding paragraphs of the noble tarl's despatensio "HEer Majesty' Government can hardly anticipate any diffcunlty at this time with the United States respectingo the continental establishment of Honduras, the limits of which. in1800,were-so well known and can be so ea.'ly ascertained, and which will not be extended;- but having showne that its pretensions to the isLands of-Ruatan and Bonacea are or no recent date; and that they were -unnuestioned by the United States' Government in 1850, Her MLajesty's Government cannot admit that an alteration in the internal fonn of goverunment of these islands is a violation of the treaty, or affords a just cause of remonstrance to the UJnited States .--.II.

The inumtes of the last meeting having bee#n read and confirmed, Mr. L TAnon said, it afforded him great satisfdion, as one of the representatives at the board for the city, to be abletoinformtheboardthat at ameetingof theCommont Council of the city of ILondon, of which he vas a member, held on the preceding day, a resolutionwas unanimosy agreed to conceding the use of their Council-chamber in Guildhall for holding the future meetings of the, boerd, so long as it might be required for that purpos. (Hear.) The PP.nErNT said, he could not doubt Sthat this graceful act on the part of the Lord Mayor and Common Council of the eity of London would ba duly appreciated by the members of the board, and he hoped thit it would only the more tend to unite the governing bodies of this metropolis together, incorporated, as they were, for purposes connected with the public weaL (Hear.) Mr. Onoon, at a subsequent part of the sitting, said it was highly gratifying to learn that the Common Counei bad accorded to the board the use of their Council-chamber for holding its meetings, and he moved a vote of thanks to the Iord Mzyor and corporation for this graceful and courteous at on their part The motion was seeonded by Mr. SBA.nGG, who bore testimony to the umanimity with which the resolution was passed by the Common Council, and carried with acclamation. RESIGNATION OF A IMEHE The Hon. SECErTARY read a letter from Mr. Josiah Wllkinson resigning his seat at the board as one of the representatives or Sthancras. -m- The PssoEr said, inreferenceto the resignation of Mr. lalkirman, a question had arisen onwhich he (the President) was desirous of having the opinion of the board as to the course to he pursued under similarcireuistanceko They were aware that the actof Parliamentm der vhichthey were constituted required that members wishing to withdraw from the board should send in their resignations to the chairman. That had been done in this case;; but lne thought it wss only proper and courteous that this board should be made acquainted with the fact of a member's resignation before it was communicated to any other body. He had received a letter from the vestry clerk of St. Pancras, lwshich district Mr. WiLkinson represented, stating that that gentlemnan had resigned his seat at the board, and that the vestry would proceed to elect another member in his stead he (the President). in his answer to the vestry clerk, stated that inthe case of SirJohn Shelley The fact of his resignation was proply communicated to the hoard in the first instmace, and then duly notHied to his constituents in St. James's, Westminster, and that that course seemed most consonant with the dignity of the board, and i convenient precedent for its future guidance. (Heear, hear.) Mr.tTeairman said while he thought the beard. was indebtedto the Predetfor the courtesy he had showniin this matte; he felt it was due to the vestry, whose representative had resgned, that thca should be immediately acquainted with the fatdin order that they might, without loss of time, proceed to supply his ptlace, lie moved that the chairman in future be roquested, on the receipt of the resignation ofany member, to communicaterthe asct withoust loss of time, and withoult wvaiting for a meeting of the board to the constituent body whom he represented Mr. L, TAYLOR said, he would second the notion if it was not meant tr iply any reflection on the conduc of the President in this particular case, but not othertise. He trusted the President would understand that he (mer. Taylor) taorodthe course he had taken imthis instance, sbvut appliatioe future he hoped the suggestion made by MIr. Turner would be acted upon in similar cases whenever they arose. The Pr,ESmESe said, he had brought the letter of the vestryclerkunder the consideration of the board for the purpose of ascertainimg their viewrinrespesto it. Io had felt that no other course was open to him ins the matter thanL to follow the precedent in the case of Sir John Shelley, beheving that at was meet cHnvenent to the board and most consonant w;ith its diguitythat the fact of resignation should be made directly to the board itseht (Heat) Mr. flows considered the motion i unncessary,' seeing that tho meetings of the board, at which such resignations could be sent in, would be at least once a-w eek MIr. Xvenu moved the previous question, as a means of proceeding with the real business of the day, and The resolution of MEr. Turner ws put and lost. ElETOh OF THE CLE7RK. The Pssrsinns'r said, he had carefully gone through the several applcations for the ofice of clerk to the board, aun number, and he found that eight of them did not come within the condition prescribed by the board, inasmuch as they did not belong to the legal profession, and thst theremarning 22 wrere memboers of that profession, being either harrsters or solicitors. He Thought it would be convenient todthegboard to make that distinetion, as the board had agreedat aformer meetigto appoint a gentleman of the legal profession as their clerk, and as it would lessen the difficulty of makiing the selection. He might also state, in fairness, that most of the candidates had sent an application similar to the one made to himself, as President, to each member of the hoard; but some had only made their appications to himself, boelieving, no doubt, that their cotumanications wrould be read to the board at their meeting this dav.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ d rle DAsi,os deprecated the time of the boardbeing occpiedby goingrtrough the whole of the applEcations and testimonials of the candidates, and moved, as a means df diminishing the difficulty of makigtheir choice, that the names of the eight gentlemen, not of the legal profedsima, should atonce be struck offcthe list. This aas done accordingly, and Mr Denta ox moved that they should new proceed, as in the election of the chairman, to thae a show of hands oe each of the remainin-candidates, strikmgf out each tinic the namec of the candidate low est on the po7 , and so gradualy drminishing the numberto the one wrho should have the highest number of suffges. Acr.Le TAYLOR proposed another plan namely, that they should not take a show of hands on each of the candidates eedotitm, and reduce the number one by one, as sag7ested by Mr. Dalton, but reduce the whole numberato si amthe firsttlace, and, wen they had donethat,teyeamtre more trouble to ascertam the individual qualfications of the thol-e si, so as at last to put their fingers on the an best fitted for the situation. (Hear, heard) He moved an amendment to that effect. Tha PWestmin said, they would not select the best man, he was afraid, unless they first investigated the documents sent in by the several candidates. (Hear, heat.) Some of the candidates had only sent applications to him, as PresidentLand notto theindividualmembers of he board,was most of them bad done, and unless the applications of the7 former ere no readtheheboard ranbthe iisk of missing tha very best man. A conversation atuned as to whether the candidltes should be allnowted to address the board before the election wias proceeded with, in which Mr. Offer, r. Turner, .Ur.

It appeared that the propertyin stio belonged to Nokes, blit was under a mort2ge, 6stto Miss Laslettt and secondly to tiheplaintiff. -& otime previous to the execution e the deed sought b;y the bill to be set aside a verbal .-eement had beeu entere into on behalf of Miss lasIett or the purpose of selling a portion of this property to Z=d-Waldegrave fc,r the sum of 5,4001., ad it was the ten ecnt of this i.icomplete contract that the plaintiff coutende& amounted'to a frand upon him, inasmuch as his interest in the premises was rendered of considerably more value than 1,O1O by such agreement. It further appeared that the offer to sell for 1,01. was a voluntary one on behalf of the plaintiff, and therefore the sole pnint to be decided was whether it was the duty of Eiss ladsett to have told the pyaintiff that she had entered into an agreement vith Lady Waldegrave for a sale of part 'of the property, athough at the same time such agreement was not in any -ay binding upon her. It Ehould also be statel that the evidence showed it all along had been the intention of the parties not to enter int,any binding contract -with lady Waldegrave until the interest of the plaintiffhad been disposed of. It was under these circumstances the Master of the Rolls dimissed the biU with costs. The plaintiff appealed from that deci- Sion. Mr. Elderton appeared, with 3fr. James, for the appelIant; 3Mr. R. Paner and.fr. A Smith were for the defendant Laslett; and 3fr. W. Morris for the defendant Nokes. The LOBD CHArcEsLtoR said he entertained no doubt whatever in'the case. It had been alleged that the defen dant Iazlett stood in a fiduciary position towards the plaintiff, -rnd had in that'eharacter committeda,fraudupon him; but did the evidence bear out the charge? It was quite true that it was incumbent upon a mortgagee with a power of sale in exercising that right to do it with fairness to all the subsequent mortgagees, by obtaining the best price that could he obtained for the mortgaged property. But could it'be said thMt any such duty was mnposed upon the mortgagor, or one of the mortgaees buying from another mortgagee, as riade it imperative upon the buyer to see that he gave the utmost value for his purchase H Ie (the lord Ch1ancellor) must say that he was not aware of any such law..- It was the ordinary case of caveat emntoi andthis Court possessed no power to impose on a buyer the obligation to tell the vendor that the sum he proposed to sell his property for was not the largest hecould obtain. Such a regulation of morality was beyond the reach of this Court. But if a vendorwereguilty of a suppressioreri,whereby a purchaser was injured, this Court would give relief, and tltereore the only question to be determined in the presecnt casewas, had Mr. Laslettbeengulty ofsuehasurp rese nt His Lordship then went through the various facts, and referred to the correspondence that had passed between the parties, and said he was wholly at a loss to find out where the plaintiff had been fraudIlently deceived by Lsslett. He could find no sugge8tio falsi or supprcssio ien. The plaintiff was as well aware of the value of the propr as any other pCors, having beenprofessionally conmntec with it for some time previously. Moreover, the evidence proved that laslett had made up his mind not to enter into any formal cortzact with Lady Waldegrave until the interest of the plaintiff in the property had been disposed of; and had he, therefore, been guilty of a supfreSio eri when he told theplaintiffthatncontract for sale existed with Lady Waldegrave at a time that only a verbal agreement existed, which was not binding upon either party?9 So far from suich being his (the Lord Chancellor's) opinion, he thought that, as there was no contract, there had been no fraud, and that the transaction was one which a man of honour mitght with all fairness enter into as between man atd man. Ihe Master of the Rolls had arrived at avery proper conclusion, and the appeal must be dismssed with costs. S| 131itOs V. ROSE. The LORD CHA?cELOR gave judgment in this appeal on Saturday last, and which was reported in The TZmes of Monday. His Lordship, however, at the time, said he should like to look through the authorities before finally disposing of the case, and wouldmention whether he saw any reason to alter the view he had formed of it. His Lordship now stated that he had examined the cases, and fomun nothing in them to alter the o9pinion formally expressed. The appeal must therefore be dismissed. BEWLEY V. HANSOCK. This appeal from a decree of Vice-Chancellor Stuart was argued during the sittings after last terzm, and stood over for judgment. The question raised by the bill was whether a patent taken out by the defendant Hancock on the 28th of July, 1848, for giving shape and configuration to plastic substances camne within the operation of an agreement dated I May, 1845, so as to entitle the plaintiff to a part ownership in sach patent. By that a,reement it was stipulated that certainpatents which had been then taken ouat by Hancock relating to the working of guitta percha, and all future patents in relation to tie preparationand applicationof that substance, should be assigned to trustees upon certiin ttusts for the benefit of the plaintiff, the defendant Hancock, and others. Thepatentof July, 1848, had been extensively usedfor coating and covering the wires of the electric telegraph with gutta percha. The contention on behalf of the paintiff was that the disputed patent came within the scope of the agreemaent, inasmuch as it related to the application of gutta percha. For the defendant Hancock it was urged that the patent was one for machinery, and, having no reference whatever to gutta percha,' could not be included in the agreement. The Vice-Chancellor decided in favour of the plaintiff, and from that decision the defendant Eancock appealed. The Solicitor-General, Mr. Bacon, Mfr. Miaius, Mr. Giffard, Mr. Fowler, Nith Mr. Hindroarch and Mr. Webster (of the commou law bar), were the counsel engaged ina the case. The LoED CnsacELmon this morning gave judgment, and, after going through the evidence, which was of a most voluminous character, said that he agreed with the decision come to by the Vice-ChanceUor. Thero could be no reasonable doubt that the patent of IS4S was included in the agreement of S4S, and therefore the appeal must be dismissed I with costs. (Befo-e thie LORDS Juscs of Aa'APP.) EX PARTE WADE, IN RE WADE. This case, which stood over from the last day of bankrupt petitions for a further affidaTit, came on for hearing. The petition is that of the bankrupt, praying that the judgment of Mr. Commissioner Ayrton, of the Leeds Distnct Court of Bankruptcy, whereby he refused to grant the bankrupt a certificate of conformity, might be dischaaged or varied, and that a cert'icate might he granted. The facts were that Mr. Thomas Wade, of Newley, near Leeds, stone merchant, carried on that business up to the 9th of JUly, 1855, at which time he ascertained that he was not solvent, whereupon he petitioned for an adjudication, and was thereupon declared a bankrupt; that in his balance-sheet appeared the following statement "1854. In consequence of my hearing a very favourable report of the Turish Scrip I was induced to purchase at a premium, but, unfortunately, they receded. in nprice considerably, and I was compelled to pay the difference" as below, 4241. 19s. 8d.; that on the 12th of November, 1855 the bankrupt, atthe request of the Commissioner, made a declaration " that I purchased in September and October, 1854, Turkish Scrip for the account-day in London, which would be more than a week from the day of purchase," * * * "and I sustained a loss thereby of upwards of 2001.," whereupon the Commissioner deEvered judgment on that day, wherein he stated that, if the transaction had related to English stock, it would have been within section 201 of the Bankrupt Law Consolidation Act, and that the question was whether the loss mentioned in the balance-sheet was within that clause, the transaction being one relating to foreign scrip, not stock, and he expressed Is opinion that such transaction was within the latter portion of that section-namely, that relating to "Government or other stock;" and he stated that, although it was unnecessary to rely upon that as a ground for his decision, he was strongly inclined to think that the transaction was a sort of aibin- or wagering within the prior member of that section; ana he added that, if not, sril it would be the painfal duty of the Court to refuse the certificate under the discretionary clause, 198 of the act; but as therewas no moralfraud, protetion would be granted. When the case was before the Court, on the 14th of December last, their ordshipsreauired an amfidanvt to explain a certain word used by the brorer in his account. The affidavit was now produced, whereb Mr. Walker, a stockbroker, swvore that in June, 1I, the T'k ish Government,'by firman of the Sultan, authorized the raising of a loan of 5,000,0001. stering at 6 per cent., which was soon after promulgated on the Stock-Exchange through the agency of the Baron de Goldsmid and Mr. Horsley Palmer, and the Egyptian tribute was made the security for the loan; that upon paying 151. per cent. to be subscribed, the contnbutor received a scrip certificate, and upon the payment of the balance the holder would be entitled to a bond for the amount. The affidavit then set forth that such scrip passed from hand to hand. The 201st section of the Bankruot Law Consolidation Act enacts that "No bankrupt shall be entitled to a certificate of conformity under this act, and any such certificate, if allowed, shall be void, if such bankrupt shall have lost by any sort of gaming ar waering in one day 201., or within oneyearnext preceding the-issaingofthefiat, orfilingof the peti'ion for adjudication of bankruptcy, 2001. ; or, i1he bali within ono year next preceding the issuing of the flat or the filing of such petition have lost 2001. by any contract for the purchaso or sale of any Goveninmeat or other stock where such contract as not to be performed within one week after the contract, or where the stock bought or sold was not actually rnfre rd}vzdnusaco such contract" y rnfre rdlvee npruneo Mr. SwAxsTO and Mrr. BAGSIHAWE, inn., CossA.nued their former - argument, contending that the act did. not refer to such a thins as scrip, which ,wa distinguhed and plainly distnguishable from stock, whether English or foreign; that there was no opo sncrdtor, and even the assignees left the questionalo =ter to the discretion of the Court; that, although the Cuthad decided in "1Matthew's cae, 1, Do GexC, Macnaghten and Gordon's Reporls, Jrge= 44t, tha riwy stock was the eaning section, ift had abstained lani'scas," n. he ecod vlum ofthe same -repors page 9y and dwhatetJo uerthe odto cb1bing Act the couts f lw ad een stic incontrungthe wordIsof the Lor'd JustiCe XMsGuT .BsRcz-Was-not this i purchase for aL future day? and if it was-not a gambling transaction, Sthe expression is underttood in law*, wsitnot infact and substance a gablihig tzanaction?

Trhe learned counsel trusted- tbat, as the bankrut had already been without his certticute for six months, the Court would cosider that a furthersuspension of it for two months would be a suffcient indication f it d of the bankutpt's imprudent conduct, and would at the end tiof that time gunt it, leaving the validity of it oven to question' if any oneAthought it wortlwhleoustn it,. 31r.Gnsma~,for he ssigees,sai tha hewas in1. strocted to say that they had no hostile feeling to the bankrnpt, who haKcommnenced business at a very early age, and had in every respect conducted himself honestly and pro-gerly, with this only efxception, and that they were desirous )e should have the opportunity of retrieving 'ois affaidrs by future trade. Lord JUiStiC KNNml BRucV said that the loss of 4241. to the estateby the purchase of scrip for a future day was a proceeding waich no steady tradesman would enter intowhich no prudent 3-an woud intermueddle with-and was one which this Court could in no way countenance. But, as Lord- Eldon, in a case of a doubtful certificate, had alloted it to go, subject to the risk of its being questioned at law, and as, if this Court refused the certificate, the bankrupt would be without any remedy what. ever, while, if it were granted, its validity might be questioned at law, their Lordships were disposed to grant one, but not without a ve material qualification, by its suspension; that whatever tee Court did was not to be considered a precedent for any other case, but as one founded upon theparticularfacts of this case alone, whichwasavery speclal case. TheirLordships, considering thatthe bankrupt would be at liberty to try the validity of the certificate at law, and that the scrip dealing was the onl imputation uponhim, and that the assignees and the credi tors alike abstained from opposition, hd come to the conclusion that the certifcate should' be granted of the second class, but not until the lst of January, 1857. They gave no opinion whatever whether the certificate would under the act be void at law. He (the lord Justice Knight Bruce) wished it to be very distinctly understood that the Court gave no opinien whether the view of the learned commissioner of the statute was correct or not, aLd thatthe judgment of the Lords Justices was not ac judgnent disienting from his Honours view; and he also desied that the judgment of the Court might be in no way misrepresented. Mr. SWAiSro. applied for a return of the deposit of 201. paid on the presentation of the petition of appeaL Lord Justice KxiGHT BRucE said that it might be returned, as the assignees did not oppose it; hut the return of the deposit must not be taken as any proof of dissent from the judgment of the Commissioner. Lord Justice TUmsesEa said that the banlkrupt would be entitled to try whether the certHifcate would be valid at law, and his Lordship eressed great doubt whether at law scrip would be held to be stock within the meaning of the statute.
VICE-CHANCELLORS' CONRTS PRTnAh- .TAV IR RE RA-MqD; S TRuSTs. (Bforc 7ice-Chanceltor Sir R. T. XIsKrM sLLY.1 This was a petition presented by Mary Bent, praying payment out of court of I'3!. 3s 2d., to which she was entitled under the will of Richard Ramsden, under the name of Mary Crewe. It appeared that the petitioner had married one Vincent Crewe, by whom she had two children, but in 1845 he deserted her and lived with another woman abroad. Seven yearshavig elapsed, and no tidings having reached the petitionerof Vincent Crewe, in 1852 she married one Bent, a labourer, with whom she now lived, and the question was whether, under these circumstances, the petitioner was entitled to a transfer ofi the fund to her. Mr. HoPwooD appeared in support of the petition, and submitted that the time which had elapsed since Crewe's desertion, without his having been heard of, was sufficient to render her subsequent marriage vald. Mr. Hetherington appeared for the trustees. The VIcx-CELsxcis.LLoUthought that the second marriage could not be regarded as valid, masmuch as the very object of Crewe's desertion was that he should not be heard of ; but, under the circumstances, the petition being amended by adding a next friend for the petitioner, under either of her names, and maldng Bent a co-petitioner, if the parties thought fit, an order might be made for payment of the dividends to her. LN RE THE TBEGONEBRIS CARNEIONE PATWORH TIN 3MIiG COMPANY. Mr. Romeunma appeared in this matter on the ordinary petition to wind up this company, which was projected in 16% for wrorking certain mines in Cornwall on the costbook principle. The roles which wcre then proposed were signsedby the shareholders, and the committee of management was to consist of at least three, and not more than five persons, who were to be qualified by having lOOshares each. 4,120 shares only were allotted, the company bein intended to consist of 12,000, with a pyment of li Ler share deposit. A lease was granted of the mines in anuary, 1854, and the mines worked from that time, but 5-6. only had been realized, and there were considerable arrears of wrages due to trhe miners. Great losses having been sustained, and the company being, in fact, insolvent, and actions having been brought against certain of the shareholders, and no dividend having been ever declared, the present petition was presented to dissolve and wind up the company. The VIx-CnANCELn.OR made an order for a reference to the Master in the usual way, and directed payment of the costs out of the estate. (Before Vice-C7anaellor Sir W. P. WOOD.) LANCASTER AND CARISSLE RATWAY COMPANY V. TIM NORTH-VESTERN RAILWAY COMPANY. The VIV-CHAscEL'oVt delivered judgment in this case, a short statement of which appeared in Tie Times of Tuesday, the defendants in that report being incorrectly described as "the London and North-Western Company." The case, it will be rememnbered, came before the Court on motion by the plaintiffi for an injunction to restrain the defendants from proceeding with an intended application to Parliament, inconsistent with the terms of certain agreements which had been made between the comna andby one of the terms of which agreement it was alleged that the defendants had expressly contracted not to make such ap plication to Parliament. The motion was opposed on several grounds-namely,that,in fact, according to the true construction of the agreement there was no such contrat as the plaintiffs alleged, and that the agreement was invalid for several reasons, and that any agreement not to apply to Parliament for a leglative enactment would be void, as against public policy. This vas the mainpoint of discussion. His Hoxoun said that his first impression had been that if he camae to a conclusion that the agreement was invalid on the last ground it woudd have been unnecessarj for him to gve any opiion as to the other points of the case; but he d changed his opinion, and felt bound to say that upon the construction of the agreement he was entirely with the plainffs in their view that the intended application to 1ar2ent by the defendants was an application inconsistent with the intention of the agreement, and repugnant to the clear meaning of it. (Eis Honour then referred to the agreements as set out in the bill, which it is unnecessary to notice further.) Not being altogether satisfied with the grounds (other than the main ground) on which the invaiddity of the agreement had been put, and it being unnecessaryto give an opinion on them, his Honour said he should confine himself to the objection whether the agreement was void as against public policy. This question resolved itself into two branches-first, whether it was competent for the defendants to enter into any such agreement at all, and, secondly, whether this Court would interfere by injunction to restrain them from infringing it. As to the power of the Cou,rt to interfere, there was no doubt as to its jurisdiction in this respect. The cases before Lord Cottenham were not the first on this point. Lord Brougham, in 1831, inthe case of "Ware v. the Grand Junction Water Company" (2 Russell and Myine, 483), had said that it was "quite idle" to represent a motion of this kind as "an attempt to restrain by injunction the proceedings of the High Court of Parliament." Lord Cottenham on many subsequent occasions also expressed a very clear opinion on this point, the ground of such opinion being that this Court acts upon the person and not on the jurisdiction. But the power of the Courtf was one thing and the expediency of interfering was another; and upon the question of expediency he would refer to three cases before Lord Cottenham in the years 139, 1848, and 1850. (Elis Honour then read passages from the followingcases:-" TheAttorney-General v. the Manchester and Leeds Railway Company," l Railway Cases- "Stockton and HartlepoolCoimpanyv. the Leeds ald ThirskandtheClarence Railway Comnany," 2 Phiins; and " Heathcote v. the North Stafordshize Railway Company," 2 3PNaghten and Gordon.) In all these cases it was to be observed that Lord Cottenham's remarks upon the jurisdiction were addressed to bils respctmg property and private interests, and not to a case e the present. The real question here was whether this Court should interfere to specificaly perform an agreement not to apply to Parliament, and thus prevent the parties from bemg relieved from a contract which, upon grounds of public policy, they alleged to be an improper one. If they went to Parliament one of two things must ha pen-they would either fail or succeed. If the proposed bill were rejected, the plaintiffs would be in a position to proceed for damages against the defendants to compensate them for the expenses incurred by the plaintiffs in opposing it. On the other hand, Parliament might thiuk fit to pass the proposed bill on public grounds. They would have the bil discussed with full knowledge of the agreement between the two companies, and yet on bubliegrounds and for the public benefit theymight think nt to pasS the bilL In such case what would have been the result of this Court interfering?-- Why,- to-prevent thisbenefit from being secured to the public. Such an interference would behighly improper, and ought not to be exercised. This Court was not the tribunal before which the question could be discussed as to' whether or how the publie might be benefited- byh the ptopos& -pphlication. Thle motion for the injunction must be refused; but, as the Court. quite coincided with the plaintiffs in their view of the construction of the agreement, it must be without costs. T.iswasa - CHA}FERS V. DAY. - This was a iotionon behalf of theplaintiffto coinel two of the defendants, Thomas. Ariitage Day andd Mr. Vichol. son, to attend before the examiner and produce certain book5 and docmnents set out inthe notice of motion. The object of this suit, wieh is instituted by a judgment oreditor(one Edw4rd Day), is to recover payment of his debt from the execlitors ofa testater, under whosej iil the debtor was -tnititled. to a' share of his estsite, and upon~ this share the plainsfir claims to have a charge its equit, alleging that it is stfi in the exeontora' hando unaccounted for, and claimi-ng anac0unt of the testator'sestate invzder. toa ertainsucishare.

The answer deniea using anyof the tesator's assets int the banking business, and denied the plaintidsiight to inquire into the accounts; and, adnsitting there Wvere "certain books -relating to the said banking business,- but not otherwise relating to the testator's estate, or to any matter in -the bilUmentioned, stated that the executors had not any interest in such books, except that the defendant Thomas Armitage Day had aloint Uiterest therein with his' partner Nicholson,. but no schedule of books WaS annexed to the answer. The p,lantiff-then filed a'supplemental 'bill, snaking Nicholson a party, and addressing special interrogatories as to the banking books. These interrogatories the defendants declined to answer; whereupon the plaintiff filed exceptions for in. sufficiency, which were overruled by the Court with costs. The plaintiff then took out a sumsmons in chambers for the production of the books in the possession of the defendants, which summons was dismissed with co'ss. The plaintiff then amended his supplemental bill, charing the defendant Nicholson with knowledge of the alleged breaches of trust, and again asking for accountsof the baning business. The defendants answered'this' bill, but without giving any furtherdiscovery asto the accounts,whereuponntheplaintiff again .led exceptions to these answers, which 'exceptions were again overruled with 'costs. Issue having been joined in the suit, a subpcena duces tecumn was served on the defendant to produce certain books and accounts relating to the partnership. This the defenldants declined to do, and further declined in their examination as witnesses to answer any questions touching the bankin"bnsiness, whereupon the plaintiff served the defendats with the presen't notice of motion to cosnpe obedience to the subpoena. IUr.Willcock, lIr. W. a. Terrell, and tr. TNeedham (of the commlaon law bar) appeared in sunport of the motion ; lMr. W. JL James and Mr. Hobbouse, cotrdr, were not caLled on. «The Vim-CACaEUEo said the motion must be refused, with costs, on the samae grounds on which the defendants had been hitherto protected from giving any answers to the interrogatories resTectingthe books and partnership business-namely, that it was not cormpetent for a judgmnent creditor to bring into this court parties who Aere indebted to his debtor for the purpose of charging them. Such a courso would be mlost inconvenient. The statute 1 and2 Victoria, cap. 110, by which divers remedies were given to judgment creditors against the property of their debtor did not mention " debts" among the several partculars. enunteratad of "stock, funds," &c. and, although it was true that by the Comm3on law lrocedure Act of 1854 powers were given by a certain porecess at law to deal with debts due from A judgment debtor, no arguanent could be founded orthat statute in .support of toe present motion.
COURT OF QUEEYS BENCHE. WsT- 3TA 1R UASEVRLL V. WOROTH AN OTHLS. OW172y5 In, nba"Co, oeeOM "YL4 CAMPBELL and Ju7tim COLERmDGQ, WAzo3L&Nm and CoxwPmOj.) dms case came berore the Comrt upon a demurrer to the defendafnts plea. The action was brou'zhtagaiust th~e occLupiers of a nmnufactory of flax and woo'l at tourporte in Worcestershire, to recover damages for an injury susined by the plantiff by reason of the defendants' negledins to fence certan h milgearig, as required by the 21st seckion of the Factory Act, the 7thofVictoria,c.15. Thedeclarationalleged that the defendants were the occupiers of the mil in queistion, in whiich there was certain mill-gearing with a shaft minmotion under the direction of the defendants, that the plaintiff lawfully wasientl factoryof th e defendantswiththeirconsent on the 16th of January, 1855, and that by reason of the dafendants neglect of duty in not fencing the shaft the p laintiff was caughit anid enitangled with the shaft, whereby hIds arm was fractured. The defendants pleaded the general issue, and also a. ial plea, which aleged that, though trueiit was that thesaid shaft was not properly fenced, a cetan drIvn strap attached thereto was not inx motion, and that the plainitiff wilfully, and eontra&y to the commands of the efendants, touched and caugit hold of the strp, -whereby the shaft was set in mrotion, and that by the gross negligence of the plaintiff in touching the strap,an~d not merely by the negligmene of the defendants, the plitiff sustained the injury of which he complained To t plea the plaintiff demurre Two qestions were thus rasd for he deciion of the Court-the fist being, whether the action could be sustained, and, if so, whether the special plea was an answer to it. - - Mr. WEosBy, in support lJ the demurrer, contended thit the action could be maintained, and that it was no answer to it to ray that the plaintiff had contributed to the action bY his own -negligence. M1r. M1. Satnsn (with whom was Mfr. Fry) was heard in suport of the plea. He also contended that the action could not he sustained, but- that the proper course was to proceed against the defendants for the penalty to which t-hey had become liable under the act. Lord CAielraEuL said that, as the Couirt felt hound to gv judgment for the defendant on the speca ples, they wo abstain from iag any opndon on the quesidon whether the action colfl& be sustained, reeinig that their decision on that point could not be reviewed. With respect to the spcal plea, his Lordship thought that it was an answer to the action, -It alleged that a certain driving strap, by which the plaintiff was entrnled, as muentioned in the declaration, was not in motion at tde time, but wholly at rest, and that the plaintiff-wilfuly, iproperly, and against the wi and command of the defendants, touched the said strp and ret the machinery in aotion, the plaintiff well nowving that what he wasdoing was danierous, and cont to the will of the defendants, and that by the act of the laintiff him-self, and not merely by the negligence of the defendants, the plaintiff was caught by the shaft and whirled about and injured, as complained of in the declaration. The Court must'now assume that all that was allge in this plea was true. The Factory Acts, his Lordship observed, had beeni most salutary.- in their effects ; but they would be most unjust and oppressive if such an action as thae p resent could be maintained. The fact was that the shaft in question was not fejiced asit ought to have been ; but then it was also a fact that the plaintiff, -knowing the danger of what he was doing, and contrary to the orders and against the warning of the defendant, wilfully laid hold of the sttap, and so caused-the injury. It miight as well be said that if a man latid his hand on the shaft, knowing that if he did so his arm would be broken, he might maintain an action for that injury.

SHEPPARD ANif OTHERS, This case was similar to the Last, with the exception t-hat the defendants had also pleaded a plea in which they alleged that there did not exist any such danger as to require sc fencin, as in the declaration, was mnentioned. Mr. 'WELsinr, in support of the demuirrer, contended that the plea was bad. It an effect alleged that the fencing re;quired by the act Was un3nece.ssary. Mr. MAYNARD, in support of the plea, said the shaft was so placed thatnoonecoulldeomenearit. It wasthereforefenced, and did not require that sort of fencing which -was mentioned in the declaration. Maigistrates had been in thehabit. of holding that shafts like this were not within -the miischief whiich the act contemplated.

The 21st section said that " all parts of the mil gearing in a factory shall be. securly fenced.?' it did not say that that should be done -where there was- any danger, but that it should be done in allecases. It was not lefi to the judge or jury tosa where such fencing was necessary, but the Legislature hlai d down a general rule, which.- -the defendants had disobeyed.

It wias contended by the defendants on the facts that the note was given only for past services, and that there vas no consideration for the note, and that the direction of the Chief Baron was wrong. TIhe COURT tohday delivered judgment. The Court had looked iato the shorthand eriter's notes of the learned Judge's summing up, and upon the hole theyo though Tere ougrt toheoane triaL It was plain that it was tak-en for granted that the promnissorynote as given as a gratuity for past services; hut it was left to the jury whether there was an arrangement that the note should also be for future sertices, and theywere told that if the note was a gift for pant services, and also that future services were to be done then there wrould be a good consideration for the note The Court thought that was not the right way of leaving the question to the jury. To m,ake a good future consideration there must have been some contract with the plaintiff to peform future serdices. But in this case there was nothing to show that the plaintiff mright not have repudiated ay such contract. The Court therefore thought the rule ought to be absolute. MORGAN V. ZnRny.

COIRlT OF EX1TTEnOTTP'L -A- r. - NEW TBA PA1'P. (SiWinc/in .Ban-o.) BROWN V. OVERBURY. This was an action brought to recover the sum of 261., the almount of the stakes for a steeplechase, which was claimed by the plaintiff as the owner of a horse called. the 3Enor from the defendant as the stakeholder. It appeared at the trial before Mr. Justice Coleridge, at the last Warwick Assizes, that one of the conditions of the race was that " any disute which might arise should be decided by the stewards ' and that the Minor having won the two last heats of the race, the plaintiff claianed the stakes, whereupon a dispute arose, which was referred to -the three acting stewards, there being, in fact, four stewards. These gentlemen met accordingly after the race, when two of the three were in favour of the plaintiff; while the third inclined to the owner of anotner horse; but no positive decision even of the two was finally aarrved at till afterwards, when they agreed to give an award in favour of the plaintiff. At a subsequent time the one drew up and executed a formal award, which he forwarded to the other, who likewise executed it and sent it on to the defendant; but hc, acting on ihe opinion of the third stewvard, as we understood, p?aid over the stakes to lMr. Jackson, the owner of P'nnce Albert, the competitor of the Minor. Under these circumstances, Mr. Justice Coleridge was of opinion that there was Do binding and valid award of the three stewards, inasmuch as, in the first place, it ought to have been unanimous, they forming the majority of nil the stewards; and, secondly, because, if the award of the two were valid, it ought to have been arrived at and executed at a meeting when all were present. It was then contended for the plantiff that, though the awiard w.ere had, he was at liberty to go on and prove by evidence before the jury thathis horse had won the race, and'that, at all events, he was entitled to recover his own stakes. The learned judge, however, ruled that the condition abovementioned had ousted the jury of all jurisdiction, and he nonsuited the plaintiff, who afterwards obtained this rueto -review that decision. Mr. Hayes now appeared to show cause, and MIr. Mellor to support the rule- The CoUiRT,-without any hesitation, afL-med the judgmnenr of the learr'ed judge on all the points, and discharged the rule.

The defendant, however, pleadedsthat he did not order the clothes, and that they had not been furnished upon his credit. It appeared that the plaintiff is stailor, carrying onIis business at 26, George-street, Portman-square, and that the defendaiit, who is a solicitor in Wales, accompanied his son to his shop upon an occasion -when the son, being in the nny, gave orders for certain regimentals. Accordingto thelaintiff'sversionef what transpired at that interview, the defendant pro. mised to give a check for the clothes. The son had since died, and, apphcation having been unsuccessfully made to the defendant for payment, the present action was the result. On the part of thedefendant it was, in the first place, denied that he had ever promised to pay for the clothes, and in the second that there was no necessity for hiinto mako such a;mise, as his son had abunadant moeans to pay al1 his own bls. * Mr. Baron BRIMvwir having rumnedup the evidence,;amountJlaeed-2a verdict for T,e .plaintiff for the Jl r.

A claim for therestitution of the ship, freight, and cargo was given in by the master, Peter HUIdebrandt, onbe. half of the respective owners, none of Whom&, be poqepd3 were Russian su1jects. 3 - - The QuxEi's ADVOCArE, on behalfof the captors, eipressed a hope that the Court would allow'them to give frteerproofastotheactua place.of captire.

She certainly had aconsiderable temptation to enter aport of. the enemy, as shown by theecharter-party. Wherever-the ship went there would be no difficulty with regrd to the bills of lading. It appeared that in- the course of her voyage he" had put into two Swedish ports for no assignable reason, both of which were situated at the narrowest parts of the Gulf of Bothnia; the wind at the time being favourable for her alleged destination. Tho inference to be drawn was that she bad put in there to obtain information as to the blockading squ4dron, in order to slip into a Russian port if shehad the pportunity of doin. "The Romeo," 6, Sir C. Rob., 351, and "h ie Charlotte Christine," 6, Sir C. R, 101, were authorities in favour of the application of the captors for the admission of further proof. Dr. Da&NYE followed on the same side, and cited in stpq - port of the applicationtheIS. notes of Dr. Bunaby, inthbe case of the Freedy, which occurred in 1S3. Dr. ADDJUf S, on behalf of the claimant, subnitted that according to the practice of the Court and the principles laid down by Lord Stowell there was no pretence for the introduction of further evidence either to ustify the cap.; tors or to save them from condemnation in cost6 and -da- mages. "TheHaabet," 6, Sir C.Rob.,5l, confirmed by"the. Charlotte Christine,"inthesanevolume, and"theFortnn,"decided a short time. saince; justified his. view of the case.

CIME ISys.-CLAV FOB RlESTITUTION OP SHI, FREIGHT, ANAD CARGO. This vesGel, under Greek colours, took on board at Fokl, in the Gulf of Smnyrna, a cargo of salt5 and sailed therewith to Tultsha, on, the Danube; but on rnaching Constantinople the master was informed that the water at Sulina was so low that he deemed it expedient to dispose of a portion of the cargo to reduce the immersion of the ship, and sailed with the remainder on the 19th of May last, and c- tured on the '2d of that month, about 25 miles to tbe s - ward of Cape Fontana, whereon the Odessa light is exhibited, by fler Majestys shipof-war Niger, and carried to Malta for a breach of blockade. A caim for the xestitution of ship, freight5 and cargo was given in by 3fr. Galatti, of Blomfield-street, on behalf of Mr. John Bolanachi, of the island of Syra, a subject of the King of Greece. The QuzEy's AflvocTrT, in pra the Court to condemn the vessel, said that Odessa was blockaded on the Ist of February, that the fact was published in the Londom Gazctte on the 3d of March, and that the vessel was captured on the 22d of MIay for a breach of the blockade of that port. The master stated in his deposition that he was going to Tultshia, where he expected to meet his owner, but there was nothing in the ship's papers to corroborate his assertion. There wag no document on board resembling a cargo-paper for the salt. No log had been found, the inference being that it had been destroyed. The vessel was captured 70 miles out of her conuse, and the only excuse given for it was that the master stated he did not know where he was. He submitted that it clearly showed that the vessel intended to break the blockade. The master stated that he did not know onwhat pretence be was seized, but he (the Queen's Advocate) did not bel'eve him. If the Court was of opiion that it could not condemn the vessel, then he prayed it to allow the captors to give further cvidleuce as to the place of capture. The Anatsm&LTrea .Ar'OCATE followred on the same side. Dr. ADDAms, on behalf of the claimant, said that the value of the ship and cargo was considerably wvithin 5001., which might account for there being no cargo-paper; but. the master deposed that he was the loader of the cargo, and would have been the consignee if the vessel had reached, her destination. If the vessel had been going to Odessa, what necess.ty was there for her landing any part of her cargo at Constantinople? So far as the probabilities of the case were concerned, it must be taken that1 although the ship was out of her course, from whatever cause it mihthave arisen, yet the master intended to go to Tultshia. Be must have known that Odessa was blockadedthat it was 100 chances to 1 whether he could get in, and 1,000 chances to 1 whether, even if he succeeded, he could get out again. He (Dr. Addums) hoped that the Court would either release or condemn the vessel, for if further proof were ordered the costs would absorb the whole of the proceeds. He would not say anything on the question of costs an& damages, because he admitted that the captorg'-were fairly entitled to send the case for adjudication. The QmmN's ADvoc&TR and the A.D.zRsALTY A3-vocATE having replied, The COURT reserved its decision, and again directed th& parties to furnish himwiththeir respective prayers, bywhicbs he should hold them bound.

THE MILITIA. The head-quarters of the Royal Sussex Artllery are stationed at Eastbourne, and the regiment has two companies cn detashment duty at Beshilil and Littlehampton. Since embodinrent, in Febiuary last, a large nunber of men have volunteered into the regular service-principaly to the Rogal Artillery-the country thus securing the services of trained gunners. The men still volunteer, and they are encouraged to do so by Colonel Lloyd and the officers of the regiment. Owingto the facilities for eve kindof gun drill to be found at Eastbourne the men havebeconme very perfect. Last week they fired at a target, for the first time. with two six-pounders and two nine-pounders; distance,' MeO yards. Out of 40 shots the target was struck 20 times, and in no instance was the shot more than two yards from the target. 4 stron side wind was blowing at the time. The volunteering rom the Devon Artillery to the regular forces took place on Monday last at Devonport. The regiment was addressed by ajor-General Eden, comnuanding the Western District, in an appropriate speech, on the necessity of increasing Her Majesttys forces at the present moment; after which, 3ajor Hole, commanding ia the absence of Lieutenant-Colonel Buck, MLP., also addressed thenm. Three times three for the Queen were then given by the men, the band playing the National Anthem, after which the volunteering coimnenced, and at the close of the day it was found that 101 had volunteered, 99 of whom passed the medical examination-yi7., to the Artillery, 37; Royal Sappers andMiners, 44; Royal Miarines, 1S ; being 4 men over the!quota of the regiment for the year, and8 33per cent. on the effective strength. Captain Littledale has relieved Captain R. A. Aspinall in the command of the depot of the Duke of Lancaster's Rifles at IAve ol. During the past year the latter officer has enrolled and sent to head-quarters upwards of 700 mien, many of whom have volunteered into the line, and -one to the Crimea. Captain Littledale has met with simisr success, the enrolling going on briskly. It is expected that an officer from the line will visit the regimeist for the pnrpose of accepting volunteers . Tp1wards of 200 of the men have signified their intention of Joining the regalar army.
IRELA2VD. 'k'EA CE BROSECS. (Er.oM oun ow.- coi BSro1PDEzNT.) 1nUBIAN,.1BRIDAY IORS0%G. Uublnl was perfectly electlified yesterday iorenoon by the unexpected intelligence of the acceptance by Russia of the five propositions, and the consequent probability of a speedy termination of all hostilities. It was not, however, until an advanced hour of the day, when some confirmation of its truith appeared in the enormous advance in the English funds, that people began to t3l1e confidence and to speculate more freely upon the brightening prospects of an honourable peace. Here, as well as in London, the effect upon the Stock-E^xchange was almost magical, and Consols, which closed on 'ednesday at 87s, rose to 89A, or. an advance of 3 per cent. on Tuesday's prices. The BRening Post, the sIrish Whig orKgan, in its mumber of last night, thus refers to the effect of the news upon the public mind here:- "In Dublin the agitation is extreme, and the excitement in the Chamber of Commerce and other places of public resort would be amusing, if it were not associated with a matter so deeply affecting the welfare of the empire. At the Dublin Stcek-Exchange, this day, there was great excitement, and a steady advance in prices. For Consols the quotations are 89, 989, 89A ; and for account the closing rice is 89- ; New Three per Cents., 894 5 1 ' j , for cash; Tune for a6.a t the highest quotation is 89N. The extreme advance here in Government securities since yesterday was 24 per cent. Railway and other shares improved generallv, out only by fractional advances." :DEPENCErESS STATE OF coRK iARBOun. The following memorial to the Lords of the Admiralty has emanated from a meeting of the citizens of Cork held on Tuesday last, for the oft-repeated ptrpose of calling attention to the neglected and defenceless condition of Cork harbour as a naval station, and for devising means to procitre from Government the formation of an arsenal, building yards, steam factory, and all the appliances of a comprehensive naval establisimenit. The authorship of the document is to be placed to the credit of 31r. Fagan, MI.P. "To TuE LORDs Conssio-Ins OF ToF. ADnna.uiLTr. " The memorial of the merchants and citizens of Cork, adopted at a meeting held at the Committee of Merchants' Plcoms, Commercial-buildings, the Right Worshipful the layorpresiding, respectfullysEhoweth thatyour3memoiialis!s look forward with miuch anxiety to the period when it will be deemed advisable by your Lordships' to establish in the harbour of Cork a dockyard and factory, and to raise it to the rank of a naval station, to which it is so fuly entitled from its geographical position, its inuportance, and its canacity, for all the purposes of Her "ajeseWs naval servfce. Yonr memoralis also feel that this port is fairly entitled to be placed under the command of a Vice-Admiral, which wvil secure the continuance of such an officer's most valuable, services, because your memorialists believe it is impos-sible in the great changes which has e taken place in the ast of war, that so fine a port as the south-west harbour of our brave empire, and in a country which forms a large third of the strength and sinews of the empire, can continue the most neglected of our great ports. That pending the decision of your Lordships on this inuportant sabject, your meuiorialists pray, on the part of the citizens of Cork and of the inhabitants of Queenstown, that, in conseqaence of the promotion of Sir George Sartorius to the rank of Vice-Admiral, they shall not be deprived of the services of that -most excellent officer, but that he shall be continuecd to the command of this porS, where, by his courtesy and attention to all, he has, in so short. a time, gained the goodwill, the respect, and esteem of this community. That there are in existence several precedents for an alteration of routine in this matter, and instances occur wvhere aVice-Admiralwas placedinaRPear-Admiral's station, and vice rersd, and therefore ourmemorialists hope that in a case in which this part of Ireland is so deeplyinterested your Lordshis wiR be pleased to grant the prayerof this memorial, andatoretain an the commandof the nobleharbour of Cork Vice-Admiral Sir George Sartorius, and as in duty bound your memorialists will ever pray."'
