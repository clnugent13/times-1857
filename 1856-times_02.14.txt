They state that the traffic on the line since the beginning of the present yearhas been steadily and generally improving. BRADFORD, WAKEFIELD, AlTD LEEDS. The half-yearly meeting of this company w as held yesterday .at Bradford, Mr. W. Bartt in the chair. The report stated that the purchases of the land had, w ith very few exceptions, been completed. The construction of the works was rapidly proceeding, and there was no reason to doubt that the lne wvould be ready for opening by the 1st of April, 1S57. Considering the state of the country and the money-market, the directors had avoided, and would continne to avoid, all such expenditure as could be postponed without injury to the permanent interests of the undertaLing. The balance-sheet showed that 41,7181. had been received and 43,1551. expended, leaving a balance due to the bankers Nr. Hawikshaw, the engineer, reported that the contractorhadmade considerable progress with the masonry and other wrorks. The CnRssAe, in moving the adoption of the report, observed that the whole of the works were progresinsg favourably. On account of the pressure which had for some time past been felt in the commercial world, the directors had Idtherto deferred as long as possible the making of calls, hut as it wvas now important to push on the works with vigour they would have to make another call at the earliest period allowed by law. They would then be in a positMon to exercise their borrowing powers. In reply to a shareholder, he stated tilat there vwas every probability of the line being completed within the estimate. The land had been purchasedfor less than the sum stated in the estimate, and the works had also been let for less than the estimated amount of expenditure. As arrangements had beex made by which the whole of the Great Northern traffic from Halifax and Bradford to the south. and also the Lancashire and Yorkshire Company's traffic from Leeds and Goole, would pas over this line, the prospects of the company were of a most hopeful character. TIhe report was unanimously ado pted. Three of the directors-Mr. Alderman Smith,, Mr. Anderton, and Mfr. Buck-retired by rotation, but, as a suffi. cient nuimber of shareholders were not present, no election could take place, and it was underbtood that they would continue in oice for another year. The proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the chairman. CORK AND BANlDO1T The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yesterday, at the office, GracechureLi-street, Major-General Sir J. Chatterton in the chair. Mr H. W. WoOD, the secretary, rend the notice convening the meeting. The report, an abstract of which ha, appeared inlIZ7e 2'iines. was taken as read. T7he CHaRn seoxplained that having been a pointed to take the command of troops in the south of .lrland, the duties of whihch were so onerous as to compel him to reside in that part of the country, he wfas therefore incapaci tatedfrom holding the office in the companyto which hi! colleagues had kindly elected him. and he felt considerable regret-ir leaving them. They had worked together witt unanimity and zeal for about three years and a half, theb sole object being to briig the companyontof its difficultie and to improve the property of the shareholders. He concluded by moving the adoption of the report. Mr. BATES seconded the motion, and, in doing so, ex pressed deep regret on the part of his colleagues and him. self at parting with their excellent chairman. He thea proceeded to explain the actual position of the company. le was glad that the long-disputed claim of the contractors had been ascertained by arbitration, and that the liabilities of the company were now reduced to a certainty. The directors had succeeded in inducingthe GovernnentLoan Coinmissioners to extend the time of repayment from 7 to 22 years, and that, too, at a time when money was worth 7per cent. The traffic on the line was gradually increasing, and it was to that they had to look to help them out of their difficulties. The directors had done their duty in endeavouring to raise the requisite capital to pay off the liabilities of the company, and it remained with the shareholders tc do their duty. He believed they would soon have enough, not only to pay the interest on debentures and preference shares, but some small amount to the original shareholderm Everything had been done by the directors to bring about that state of tlngs, to reduce the expenses, and td increase the receipts. The secretary had agreed to give up 50B a- year of his salary and paya clerk- the office of engineer was disensed with, and the directors had not taken the sunm allowec&them. He thought they were fully justified in expecting an increase of traffic in consequence of the improving state of Ireland, the probability of peace, and of an extension line to Danmauway. If the shareholders uvould only take ua the new shares, and enable the companyto 'pay offits liabilities, the property would be greatly improved. He complained of the conduct of the Dublin portion of the Irish shareholders, who had declared that they would not subscribe a shilling towards getting the company out of its difficulties until the boardwas removed to IreLnd. 3iI order t) meet their views the London board agreed to resign their seats for the Dublin shareholders. At meetings oshareholders in London, Bristol, asnd other places that arrangemnet was confirmed. After fully examining the 'affairs of the company, the Dablin gentlemen en ed to accept the office of directors for which they received the thanks of a meeting held in Dblin. On the faith of theirtaking office 2,200 new shares were subscribed for, and a deposit paid thereon by shareholders residing in London, Cork, and Dublin. The money was paid into thebank htothe credit of three of the Dublin gentlemen in trust for the company. From that time to the present the board bad been waiting for the Dublin gentlemen to take office. Things had remaired in abeyance, and the interests of the company had consequently been sacrificed. The excuse for this delay was that the arbitrator had not made his award; when that was made the excuse was that they had no pecuniary interest in the company. Want of confidence in the London directors had been thc cry in Ireland without any reason -whatever, for they had done everythiaz they could to promote the interests of the company. The board of direction was originally established in Cork, but-from constant disputes among the dirwtors they -were unable to go on or to raise mnoney, and the management vas eventuay removed to London. The first thing the London board did was to get the interest on the Government loan reduced from 5to 4per cent., and they advanced 12,0001. ont of their pockets to pay off debts of the comp)any anid to sett;le long-pendiw. lawvsuits. They placed 48,X000 in preference shares,-whic'ia could not be done in Ireland. But on taking office they had been greatlymisled as to the liaibilities-of the company, and had many serious difficultiees to contendwaith in consequence. All the mischief wvas done directors proposed to ras 000.P onm prefernc share to 'Pay off thelibits the Iris eshar~eholders wOuld not agree to ra-ise mnore than 10,0001. topa off30,00! ofdebs.The lino would have passgl into the hands of ether parties,, had it notbeen f7or the exertionw and edvances madeobythe London boardl. The liabilities of the coDmPanY were pressing, and if the shareholders did not come forwmard iramediately to subscribe for the -new shares the creditors would sell the railway, and lie need not tell thema that -in that: case the property of the:original shareholders would be sacrificed. Mr. Gsin~sExA read a statement, wit-h a view to s'how that t'ho l,611L ta be dirided.amoug the preference shareholders would not realize mnore than ~2 per cent. per wnnuum, andl *tliat tli rbpefer e nce larh plolersI had n o bemi iFe dite d -with the net earnin-gs., : i Mir.. thatthy had, ln h e~~eu bad been l6nt tItiIe -apital accouint, abl4id tatedhat when the new hal -w.-retrienup the money,would&b6:paid back to'revenuie account.- .Regolutions-were passed adopin terepoit,; authoriiing. l,6! ob~lce tothcrebofthpref'mereccaarloldrs,re-lectng-theetirng-ireterand-auiditor andl dectng ordC.

THE GREATNORTHERArAND THELOAMONJJ I ORTH-TVESTER BALIV Y. We have been requested to publish the followir letter to Mr. Denison in reply to a statement fro: that gentleman which appeared in n7w Tnmesm yestercay " Enston Staton. London, Feb. 13. "Dear Sir,-As you have thought fib to write, for t purpose of publication, a letter containing incorrect stai ments relative to the xatters at issue between the Gre Northern Company and the three companies we represes we beg to reply as shortly as may be to the allegatic: As, however, the subject will be fully discussed at t approaching general meetinps of the proprietors, we sb confine this reply to correcting souse only of the numerc errors of fact contained in your letter. " You state that the London and North-Western a other companies 'know. and have kmown all along, ti Mr. Clarke had no authority whatever from this (the GrI Northern) board, or any member of it, to enter upon sr negotiation.' " We beg distinctly and positively to contradict t3 assertion, and to state further, that 'we would not h. allowed and did not allow the managers of our respect companies to ' enter uton suchnegotiation,' until Mr. C1a bad stated in his official letter of August 10, that I he I the authority of his chairman (yourself) to meet forthe i cussion of a plan for the extension of the arraugemep, and further, 'that he had discussed with you the policy extending the arrangement to the Manchester, Sheffi, and lincolnshire Companis district;' to which he ac you 'saw no objection. "Itw 'as not until after the rejection by your board .the unanimous recommendations of lMr. Clarke and other three gentlemen respectively authorized, that beard the slightest suggestionof 'want of authority on I*pert of your mnanager.

B,AsG, from the Town Council of Portsmnouth, against the Police (Counties and Boroughs) bilL FORMATION OF PARISHES BILL. The Marquis of BLANDEORD, in moving the second reading of the bill observed that it was identical with ono which he introduced and explained in the last session. There was a time when there were no parishes, and their formation seemed to him to have arisen from the necessity of having centres of union and activity whence the efforts of the church might with more efficiency be directed. At first a whole diocess was a parish; then it was broken up into smaller divisions, and then, as population increased, those divisions were subdivided. Some 30 years ago a large sum was voted by Parliament and a comnis. sion was appointed to carry on the parochial subdi. vision of the country, and to the state of the districts formed by that commission he wished to direct attention. Great good had been effected, but there stiU existed anomaulies and defects which it was the object of this measure to remedy. District parishes, formed under the Church Building Acts, were taken out of large parishes. They enjoyed all the powers of performing the daily and weekly services of the church, but not the power of performing the services of baptism, marriage, and burial until after the avoidance of the mother church. The clergyman was merely a stipendiary curate, and the district was liable for 20 years to rates for the repair of the mother church. District chapehries were districts assigned to chapels already existing, and they came under much the same law. Consolidated chapelries were ulder a curious modification of the law. They were taken out of more than one parish, and full power was given a, once to perform all the services of the church. Particular districts were districts formed under the Private Patronag: Act. Thus there were four different districts under the Church Building Acts-district parishes, district chapelries, consolidated chapelries, and particular districts, each having rIles of legisation peculiar to itself, which created a vast amount of confusion and complesity, at variance with and repugnant to the whole tenor of the parochial system. Another plan for the subdivision of parishes was approved by an act passed 13 years ago, and commonly known as Sir Bobert PeePs Act. Ths Ecclesiastical Commissioners wera by that act empowered to form districts, to be endowed in a certain manner, to become parishes as soon as a church was built and consecrated, and to be entitled to all the privi leges and status of a district parochial character. The systemT, under the numerous church building acts, was exceedingly complicated; the other system, under Sir Rlobert Peers Act, was very simple, and had been found most efficacious in carrying on the parochial subdivision of the country. There were many inconveniences under the former system. Nothing cold be more prejudicial to the parochial character of a district and to the general efficiency of parochial administration than that the incumbent should not have the power of performing the services of the church in his district. It resulted in the most unseemly and indecorous performance of the services, which were thereby crowded upon the mother church. At Manchester, in consequence of the districts not having tho power toperform theservices'of baptismandmarriage, inthe mother church a state of confusion and disorder existed which excited general reprehension and disgust. The number of baptisms sometimes exceeded 100. The parties colected at a publichouse opposite the church, waitinlg the conclusion of the service, when the rite was performed, anad oftentimes the sponsors appeared at the font in a state of intoxication. At St. Pancras' marriages were solemnized in vast numbers, and the state of confsion which arose frequently destroyed the Christian solemnity of the service. In some instances, where the services could be performed in the districts, the assent of the inceumbent of the mother church was necessary, and he had a right to claim a portion of the fees. ees were demanded larger than the law allowed, and the influence of the clergy was thereby often destroyed. The districts, as he had already stated, were liable for 20 years to the rates of the mother church, and, as no benefit was derived, the district churchman frequently refused the rates, and thus discord and discontent were engendered. The simple remedy, which he had endeavoured to embody i the bill, was to declare that no church-rate should be levied in a district which was not applied to the church of that district. (Hear.) Another objection was, that the ministerwasstyled "perpetual curate." Itmight be asked, "What's in a name.' But there was a great deal in a name. t would be generally understood that a perpetual curate was either nominaDy or really in a state of dependence on the incumbent of the mother church. He proposed to alterthe name to that of "vicar," and, where tithes formed part of the endowment, to that of " rector." He proposed to give power to make districts -into independent parishes for all ecclesiastical purposes, and to provide that fees should be received by the incumbent of the mother church until after the first avoidance, when they should revert to the incumbent of the district church, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, having power to award compensation to the former for the loss of fees. These districts were the'offspring of the mother church, and the time was now come for them to enjoy a full imnmunity of parochial privileges. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners were at present enabled to form a district whether there existed a church or not, and, as there were a great number of churches to which it as desirable to assign a district, he proposed to give theEcclesiastical Commissionerstho further power to assign districtsto existingehurches. If the Government thought fit to continuethe EcclesiasticalCommis.ioners in operation, there would then be two systems at work, and the (3overnment and the House would be able to see which was most likely to answer the wants and requirements of the countrsy. Thenext feature of his bill referred tothe mode of endowingdistricts. Thereweretwoclasses of parishes requiring additionalendowment, and two modes of endowment. One was from the funds of the Ecclesiastical,Cominssioners, and the other from private liberality. There were upwards of 3,528 ancient parishes which gave incomes of less than 1501. a-year. Twenty years ago the Ecclesiastical Commissioners reported that it would require 145,000!. to augment the incomes of parishes in public patronage, -and 18,0001. to augment those- in private patronage. They had only been ablo to provide 46,0001., and the House wrould Asee how large a sumn remained to be proviided for the augmentation of clerical incomes. One thouand paritshes bad no endowA^ment at all Or a very small On% ether than pew rents. The anciie-nt principle of endowment was always to ,ethe patronage of' church'es to the parties who endowed t¶elm; and, adop'ting p:2rincip,ie he prposied to vest the patronag,e in the' han of parties contributing towards the endowment. Underanactof WVliam IV., givingtheendowmeattoparties 'Who conxtributed 401. a-year towards the,en'dowment fund. 9D,OOO0. had been subscribed, either towards tho erection of churches or the endowments assigned tothem.

The pro sons might be carried into effect without any further expense than the employment of a few clerks, since thecomn. missioners were already in existenCe, and the power of creating an increased number of districts did not cary with italage expenditure. Itwouldof roursebenecessarytopro. tect existing interests by awarding. comienation in some cases, and by providing that patronage should not be taken arway until the first avoidance by those whose interests were affected. HMs bill 'was merely one to simplify the old laws of the church, and to take advanetag of the experience which tinegave us in adapting the church of England to the wants of the eople.H e proposed no changes inconsistent with the ecclesasticalavs of thiscountry,andhe trusted that the House wouId, by passing this bill, lay the foundation of great and extensivre good, wrhich would grow up and be a blessing to thousalds hereafter. tChee s.) He had now tovask the House to agree to the second readti and, if it rere thought desiradle to send the biU to a select com3ittee, heoswowad not object. ioud cheers.) Mr. IIDDELL seconded the motiono Mr. HADFEE1D wrould like to hear the opinion of the Governmenut on this bill, whbich iappe3red,to bins to alter the entire ecclesiastical establishment of this country. The noble marquis proposed to refer this hilltio a select coammittee, buLt how Was it to be constituted? LWere the Diseenters to be fairly represented in the commnittee? The hill contained a power to apply Crown lands to chbr'ch puposes. Had not the church property enourgl of her own, and was she still dissatisfied with the enormous wealth committed to her care? He trusted that the House would nevortolerate such a clause. The House were about to insist on the entire abolition of church-rates, and yet this bill introduced a system of church-rates that would be highly objectionable and offensive to a large class of the community. He -was opposed to this bill ma'every point of view, and he was equally opposed to sending it to a seect committee. It was ana r-conideed and illl-dioestefl measure, and he proposed as camendment, that the bl'll be readasecondtimo that day six months. MIr. PELLATT seconded the amendment. Sir G. GREY said, that the bill had been brought in upon the responsibilty of the n3oble lord, and was not introduced by the Government or with their sanction, but the objects contemplated by the bill, and the principle of providing a moreeffectualmeans forthe subdivision of largeandpopolous parishes in conformitywith the changeswhich had takeplace, were so important that it was impossible not to say that Parliament ought not to direct its attention to the subject. (Cheers.) He thought it would bo wrong on the part of the House to refase a second reading to the bilL after the noble lord had expressed his willingness to refer the bil to a select committee. (Cheers.) The bill did not ask for public money, and, although there was a clause onabling the public departments to give a portion of the Crown lands under their care as sites for churches, yet it would be for the select committee first, and for the House afterwards, to say whether that power ought to be gven. The bill also did not propose to deal with church-rates except in the case of a few new churches in exceptional circum. stances. The question of charch-rates would notise prejthdiced by anything in the 'bllrs, and he, on the part of the Government, had no objection to the second reading of the bill, with a view to its being geferred to a select commmttee. (Cheers.) M:r. LIDDELL beltieved that the Ecclesiastioal Commissioners would be assisted in carrying out the provisions of this bill if they coud obtan larger powers over the funds ad revenues of the ecclesiastical corsorations his noble friend had a bil on this subject also, and he sugsnted that both bils should be sent to the same committee. The Marquis of BolNDnORD wished to correct amisapprehension into whicn the hon. member for ShIeTield (Mr. Hadfbeld) had fallen. Power n as to be given to an public department, not to grant lands for the purposes of the church, but to grant sites for churches-a power already in existence under the Church Buildin,g Act. Sir J. BERGUSSON, althought not a member of the church of England, approved of tyic measure, as Lie believed it was calculated to increase the usefulness of that church. Mr. PELLADT hoped that one or two Nonconformists would be placed upon the committee. ("Hear, hear," and laughter.) Why should not Nonconfonrists have a seat upon it as wel as members of thechurch ? The popultion had by this,time overgronn he parochial systemr, and he did not wish to throw any iupediments in the way of the improvement of that system, but it must be romembered that the number of ionconformiss, as o .ellas of members of the church of England, had greatly increased, and that they had an interest in the settleent of the questions dealt dwith by tihis bilL. Mr. HAthtInLD would not oppose the reference of the bilto a select committe, but he antendedao take the sense of the House upon the construction of that comymittee, if it were not nominated upon a fair principle. mer. GfIorSTONE said, there was an inconsistency t hake position taken up by the hon. member for Sheffield. If the pr;nciple were conceded, that no member of the House was disqualified on account of his reitgious opinions from considering the subject matter of a bill relating to the temporalities of the church-and it would certainly be invi dious and ofensive to lay down an opposite principle-an admissiou mithet, on the other band, be very fairly demandedsfrom the hon. gentleman, that he was bound in equityhand honour to give his mindtothe discussion of subjects of that rind with the view of promnotingthe interests of the church. (Hear, hear.) No objection could be taken to the spirit of the observations made by the hor. member for Southwark (Mr. Pellatt), who appeared to make such an aduission. But the hon. member for Shefeld gave it as a reason for his opposition to the bllo, that it had reference ouly to the established church and to no other religious community. If the hon. gentleman teobld adhere to the princ laid doen bythehon. member for Southwa3rk there would be little difficulty in the construction of the committee. With regard to the bil itself bethought the noble lord and the House had come to a wilse decision in referring it to a select committee. No man belorging to the church of England, or taking an interest in its welfare, could entertain a doubt with respect tothe pmcdpl.eof the bilL. The noble lord, however, with that laudable seal for the interests of the church which bad gained for him so much honour (bear, hear), was dealing with many questions of the utmost difficulty and delicacy. The Iomse reserved to itself the riht of a perfectly free discussion of those questions, and the only pldcge given by hon. gentllemern assenting to the second reading was, that they would render their oest assistance to the noble lord by proposig whatever they thought best adnpted for the attaiinment of theobject he hadinview. (Hcar, hcear.) The amnendment of Mr. ~Hs1rDFinL having been with. drawn, The bill was read a second time and referred to a select committee. POICIE (COUJNTIES AND BOROUJGHS) BILL4 Some petitions having been presented against this bill,. Sir .-G.REY moved that it be read a second time. Mr. shAnfIELt complained that the various municriD l corporations had not been allowed suficient tinse to coasider it. The town council of the berouea hIe represpnted were probably discussing it at that men ecut, ad they highty disapproved ofsit. A deputaeion from Birmingham upon the sabject was now ia London, and he believed that doputations had also been sent from York, HIull, and other borougehs. Notwithstanding the short time which had elapsed since the hDl was introduced he had received letters from ulpwards of 30 boroughs, objecting to it in principle, Two years ago an association wras formed for the purpose of watching bills of this kind, but even that association had notyethadtimoto consider the m,easure. Thc great objecEion to it wams its interference with the principle'of self-goverament. The most objectionable clauses were the 5th, the 6th, the 8th (which would establish what was little better than a spy system if it were passed), the l0th, and the 11th. The hon. gentleman concluded by movin that the second reading be postponed till that day fortnight.- Lord H. LENNOX seconded'the amendment. Sir G. GREY said, if any good substantial reasons could be shown for the postponement he would,not press ens theo bill, but be had as yet heard no such reasons. (H ear.) The hon. member for Shefiicld had answrered his owvn speech, for, after saying that the bill had not been circulated through the. country, hcestated that ho had received communications from upwards of 30 town councils who were determined to oppoe it, as they had made up their minds that it improperly interfered with their privileges. (Hear, hear.) If the House agreed to the second reading he would not take the com- mittee before next Friday fortnight. He would, bowcvei-, be guided by the opinion of the House with regard to the postponement. If the deputations spoken of by the hon. gentleman made any sugestions to him with regard to the bill he shouldireceive those sugrtions withrespeet; buthe believed they nad come7for another purpose HeRwouldtake this opportunity of correcting an error iltd -which helad fallen in moving the inrodction of tihe bill..

GRE:Y said, ag itappeared to be the general opinion of the House that the bill ought to be postponed, he wrould consent to postpone it till that day fortig ht (cho22s); or, if it could not be talen upon that lay, ti the earliest open day afterwards. He could nDot, how. ever; undertake to put off the committeo long after the second reading. (Hear, bear.) Mx. B. DEBNISO was opposed to the bil in oto. Sir G. PECHELL had been instructed by the towu council of the borough he represented to oppose the bilL. Captain SCOBELL intended to oppose it, not only beausohehad beeninstructed to do so bythe town council of Bath, but also because, as a county mnin strate with 30 years experience, he entirely disapproved of it. Sir H. WILLOUGHBY asked the iight hon. baonet for 3 statement showing the increased charge which the bill, if su2ccessful, would lay upon the counties; also for the data *pon wshich lie bad undertaken that one quruter of the oxpedituro shouild be defrayed out of the consolidated Sir G. GREY sad, the only infornation that could be obtained as to the expenditare to be borne by the counties must be obtained from the counties which had alream adopted the systemL According to the best information he com procure, the charge upon the public would be about 200,0wE, Lord LOVAINE was afraid that the sole use made of delay wvould be the organization of an opposAtion, founded not upon an objection to any of the provisions of the bilL but upon the desire felt by the corporate bodies to continue the present system, which, in his opinion, was radically a false and a bad one (hear, hear), especially as it affected the watching and lighting of towns. Mr. 3M M denied that the watching aknd lighting of our large towns were mismanaged. He w. s opposed to tha bill, as he held that the liberties aithe country were founded upon the principle of local government. If we got rid of ical Sovermnent, we should soon find ourselves ini the same situation as ourgreatnemghbouns-ve should have a despotic lGovernment. If the ''ouse submitted, to measures of this kind, Government wvould only have one step further to go -namnely, to appoint myors. Mr. MCHEML said, the large landed proprietors wanted this police merely in order to put the game laws in force. He had no doubt that when the provisions of the measr became known petitions against it would pour in from all parts of the kingdom. Hr. DENTINCIt expressed his aprroval of the bill, tha object of which, he said, was to do awyv, not llith local government, but with crime. Mr. EVELYN wa totally opposed to the principle anid to the details of the bilL Sir S. BIGNOLID was not opposed to tho bilL The town ouncil of Norwich were of opmion that it would be a grozt; b,oon to beoroughs which, like Norich, had gone to great expense in order to render their pollee effective. (Hear, hear.) He hoped pol,ice oficers would be excluded from ting in the election of members of the town council as well as in that of members of P;arliament. (Hear, hear.) Mar. BIGGS thouht an efficient police force would hava beencreated if it had been made compulsory upon tha authorities to appoint one police constable to every 1,00) inhabitants, without touching the principle of local government. Ho would never support a measure which sacrificel municipal privileges to the7principle of centralization. In reply to Mr. D. CAITEr, lr. liASSBY said, the 6th section only grnted to tha Secretary of State the same powers in respect of borough lolice as those granted to him in respect of rural polica under the act which constituted rural police. Mr. XllIGHT objected to the 5th clause, on the ground that no duties ought to bo thrown upon the police except those -connected with the preserration of life and property. Ia answer to Mr. HzynEv, Sir G. GREYsaid, he had been from time to time assured by the Inspector of Prisons that the criminal returns wern on the point of being furnished. He had received an explanation of the delay wvhich had taken place in their production, but he confessed it was not altogether satisfactory, and he had taken steps to prevent any such delay for the * ture. The amendment of Er. HAnsMrLr for the postponement of the second reading till that day fortnight was theu agreed to. JOlIT-STOCI BIANKS (SCOTLAISD) BILL On the motion for going into committee uapon this bil ;Mr. SCOTT asked for its postponement, as the question of joint-stock companies was now under the consideratioa of the Legislature. Mir. WLSON said, the bill which dealt with joint-stock companies expressly excluded banking companies. This mas a measure to enable the banks of Scotland to take advantage of the act of 1845 by becoming corporate bodies. Its postponement would be very inconvenient to thosebank-s, and he tbereforev-ishedit to pass without delay. The bill then passed through committee. On the motion of Colonel DuawEx, various returns were ordered respecM ap 3intmnents in the Ordnance and War Departments, and in the department for clothing the army. The House adjournedat 3 eclocl.

LONDON, THURSDAY, FEBRUA1Y 14, 1856. The House of Lords did not sit yesterday. In the House of Commons, The Marquis of BrA"FoRD, in moving for leave to re-introduce his bill of last session for the formation and endowment of separate and distinct parishes, described the original parochial status of this country, the object of which, he said, was to create centres of union and of ministerial activity, the whole connected and formed into one system by a bond of brotherhood. It was of the last importance, he thought, that this system should be rendered as perfect as possible. Recent subdivisions of parishes by the Church Building and other acts had introduced anomalies -and defects; districts were formed under these acts with different incidents; and this diversity produced confusion in our parochial law, from which much complication and great inconveniences arose. It was the purport and scope of this bill to remedy these defects and anomalies, byproviding, under the authority of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, for the constitution of new parishes, for modifying endowments, for appropriating lands for sites of churches, and for other incidental arrangements. He explained the leading features and many of the details of the measure, and invited the House to agree to its principle, since it introduced, he said, no change inconsistent with the ecclesiastical law of the country. Mr. HADFID resisted thefurther progress of the bill, being opposed to its principle. He complained of the enormous powers it conferred upon the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and urged various objections to the measure from a Nonconformist point of view. He moved to defer the second reading for six months. Sir G. GBEY said, although the bill had been brought in on the responsibility of Lord BLAnFoRD, without the previous sanction of the CRowh, its object was of such importance, and the principle (so far as it could be extracted from the details), that of providing for a more efficient subdivision of large and populous parishes, so well deserved the attention of Parliament, that he thought it would be wrong to refuse to read the bill a second time, as Lord BrA-rDonD had consented that the details, some of which required much consideration, should be discussed in a select committee. After a brief discussion, in which Mr. LIDDETL, Sir J. rERGussox, Mr. PELLATT, and Mr. GLADSroccE participated, Mr. HADFLED withdrew his amendment, and the bill was read a second time and ordered to be referred to a select committee. On the order for the second reading of the Police (Counties and Boroughs) Bill, 3Ir. HADnETa moved the postponement of the second reading for a fortnight. He objected to the principle and to some of the details of the bill. Sir G. GREY said, if any good and substantial reasons were alleged for postponing the second reading, he should not object; but he had yet heard none. He had no interet in pressing the bill unluly; he was in the hands of the House, and was ready, after the second reading, to fix a late day for the committee. MIr. HEN-=, SirF. BAWG, 3r. ROBERT PALMER, and Sir J. WAsIssLY recommended the postponement of the second reading, and Sir G. GREY ultimately consented to defer it for a fortnight. The merits, or imputed demerits, of the measure continued, however, for some time under discussion. The Joint-Stock Banks (Scotland) Bill passed through committee. The House adjourned at 3 o'clock.
The Marquis of BAN-nDFonD has been called an enthusiast, and, in a certain sense, he is one; but his is an enthusiasm which this age is very apt to produce. It is an age of grand phrases, which good young men dutifully learn, and, if they con-; tinue good, -endeavour to carry out. One of these' 'grand phrases is our " parochial system:' WThat it ought to mean everybody knows. It implies the parish, the parish church, the parish priest, the parish poor, the parish worthies, the parish tithes, rates, and subscriptions,-a family of families bound together by participation in the rites and ceremonies of the church and an interchange of kind offices. Books have been pablished, sermons preached, speeches delivered on this delightful visionthe nearest return in our power to the Garden of Eden. But, after all, what is a parish ? That is the basis of the whole theory, for the parochial system is a system of parishes. But, instead of findig the word "parish" to represent a simple and uniform idea, we find the word without the thing, and the thing without the word, and districts of all sorts and sizes either parishes or not parishes, as accident may determine. A parish may be two acres or a hundred square miles. You may walk round it in a quarter of an hour, or it may take you two days to beat the bounds. It may contain fifty souls or two hundred thousand, or not a single soul. It may contain a church, a congregation, a clergyman and ministerial income, or any three of these, or. any two, or any one, or not even one of them; for there are parishes from which the last man, the last'stone of the church, the last pound of the living, and the last clergyman have departe or the church may be a chapel; or a church in which you may bury- and marry; or marry and not bury, or neither, or both ; -or you may marry a hundred or two respectable people, and then discover that you have not married them, and that you must get a quiet act of Parliament to make their marriages valid. It is needless to add that in this parish you may have all rich, or all poor; or you may have a hundred people and a thousand a-year, or twenty thousand people and nothing a year. Your income may be in great tithes, or little tithes, or glebe, or fees, or pew-rents, or funds, or from Queen Aa's Bounty, or housetax, or any nmnber of these combined, in every variety of proportion. if it is not an old parish, it may, according to the act of Parliament, says Lord BT.amponD, be a " ditriat parish," or a " consolidated cha"C pelry," or a " district chapelry"-names conferring various powers on the clergyman. The legislative mind has run riot on a subject supposed to suggest the greatest simplicity and uniformity of ideas. There have long been counsel who wil not undertake a church-building case, or give an opinion upon one, because no fees they are ever likely to get -would repay the trouble of mastering some 30 or 40 statutes. Such is our boasted "parochial system." How has this come to pass? Of course, a large portion of these varieties and anomalies have come down to us from our forefathers, and all that can be charged upon us is that we have not reduced them to uniformity. But Parliament has only increaeed the confusion; and at this moment such is the passion for making a law to meet a particular class of cases that we i should not be surprised to hear a new sort of parish had been created. The district parish has been created by one act; the consoldated chapelry is the growth of a subsequent stage; to attach. a district to a chapel of ease was a later thought; while it is only by slow degrees people have arrived at the grand idea of letting persons build and endow a chuz- .and become its patrons. In "consolidated " chapelries" the offices of the church may be performed at once on the consecration of the building or the formation of the district; "but of about " 5'8 district chapelries," says Lord BLA-NDFotD in a published letter, "formed by the Commis"sioners up to the year 1853, in about 223 the "incumbents have only more or les prospectively "the exclusive power of celebrating the services of "the church." Hence, in order to obtain this power, so necessary to the comfort and efficiency of the clergymen, church founders have sometimes had recourse to the plan of including in the district a few houses from an adjoining parish. But so various are the modes of action, and so much is left to choice, that -when a new church is wanted it is usual to ask the projectors under what act they wish to proceed. No doubt, this offers an escapo from occasional difficulties. You can defy an incumbent of the dog-in-the-manger class under one act and not under another. But, if the parochial system is worth anything at all, it is worth the 1 trouble of attempting to give every church a parish of its own in the full sense of the word. It is also worth the attempt to reduce these parishes to a manageable compass. In this metropolis there are many parishes with ten, fifteen, twenty, and even thirty thousand souls, with only one church ; and in that church may be only one or two clergymen. The chief object of the Marquis of BLANDFORD'S bill is to divido these parishes not merely into districts, but intoI smaller parishes, each district being as much a parish as the original whole. Sound legislation consists in the extension of good and simple ideas. The simplest idea of a church in this country is that exhibited in the country parish-compact, independent, and complete. This, as far. as possible, is what we have to create in our towns up to the demands of the population. It has not been done, because at every corner there lies in wait some vested interest, some prejudice, or some purely technical difficulty. The patron does not want the income of his living diminished. It is true that the 1,0001. arises from the presence of 10,000 people; but, though he cannot provide for the people, and will be glad to see part of them transferred to other hands, he does not wish them to carry off a corresponding share of the income. The incumbent partakes of that sentiment. He has solemnly undertaken the care of ten or twenty thousand souls, and, though he does not and cannot discharge his trust, he cannot bring himself to resign any portion. The obstacles we believe tobe generally of this wilful and positive character, for, though there is much poverty, much indiffer- . ence, and much irreligion in the world, there is also much religious enthusiasm, and many peopleare I only looling out for the opportunity of assisting the church. There is many a clergyman in this metropolis and many a layman who would be glad to build a church and take a parish, if he had not to figlht his way to that object as hard as we had to get into SebastopoL Nine-tenths of the cry about "spiritual destitution," and of the demand for "church extension," and the rest, arise, not from the difficulty of meeting the one or effecting the I other, but from the fact that interested persons want something more than " church extension" and relief from " spiritual destitution." They are jealous of new churches, new clergy, new people, and want improvement without alteration; above all, not to abate one jot of their own dignity. No man's dignity, however, should be allowed to stand a day in the way of public good; and we trast Lord BLAsDFORD will persuade Parliament that the I parochial system is worth the sacrifice of a little' personal dignity and convenience on the part both of pastors and their flocks. The House of Commons appears to be also of this opinion, and has given Lord BLDFoRD the opportunity of extending the benefits of the parochial system.
The House of Commons has been engaged, we fear without any definite or practical result, in investigating a plan for the amendment of our legislation and the consolidation of our statute law. In the meanwhile a body of far humbler pretensions, but, as repeated experience has demonstrated, of a very useful and practical turn of mind, has addressed itself to the same subject, and, as far as we are able to observe, not without a very considerable portion of success. A Committee of the law Amendment Society, appointed to consider the statute law, has reported with a fulness, a vigour, and a perspicuity on the weighty subject intrusted to it which makes us wish that some of those who prepared this document had a more authoritative voice in carrying out the reforms they advocate. The report consists of two portions; the first, a review of the steps which have already been taken with the object of consolidating our statute law, and the second, the propositions of the committee themselves on this subject. The plans of the present LoRD CH"AKoOR for obtaining this object are commented on with some justice and much asperity. A rapid summary of events may not be uninstructive. On the 17th of March, 1853, the CacoLoR snnounced his plan for reforming our statutes. First, lhe was to e*punge obsolete or expired acts; secondly, to classify those which remained according,to their subjects; thirdly,. to consolidate these classes intow single acts; and, foiurtly, to provide a corrective for the errors of future legislation. For this, purpose a Commissioner and four SubjIajrovird ovided. The Sub-Comnis- Aibners were set to nibble at a vast number of subjects, the result of which was, that they seem to have brought none to maturity. The arrangement of duties was utterly unmethodical, and a great deal of time seems to have been absorbed in composing three enormously voluminous' reports, containing no less than 634 pages, no slight deduction from> the very small amount of force embarked in this gigantic undertaking. Theso and many other mistakes enunierated by the Committee, with painful exactness, satisfy them, and may serve to satisfy us, that the Commissioners did not cet about the work intrusted to them with any clearly defined ideas, and that'they did not follow out their labours to any very definite results. These Commissioners, however, were in August, 1854, reinforced by a Royal Commission, issued to ex-Chancellors, Judges, Attorney and Solicitor Generals, and other grave and learned persons, but their avocations do not seem to have permitted them to give any great attention' to the object for 'the sake of wnich they were instituted. They too have reported, but they also, as far as we can learn, have done little or nothing, and are now engaged in an investigation from wbich we may expect, if we are sanguine enough, some profitable result as to the propriety of establishing a Minister of Justice, who shall be able to do that which the LonD CAc11or. and all his coadjutors have hitherto so signally failed to accomplisb. We now come to consider the recommendations of the Law Amendment Society. Setting out by proposing the appointment of a Minister of Justice, or, if efforts to obtain the creation of such a functionary be unsuccessful, then of three Commissioners to execute the work of consolidating the statutes, they lay down the coiuse to be pursued so clearly and methodically that it is worth while to give it, were it only as a specimen of the very advanced stage to which opinion on the subject has arrived, and the necessity which lies upon Government to bestir itself, if it would overtake in action the views already prevalent among the best informed members of the community over which it presides. Their first step towards a consolidation of the statute law would be the publication of a revised and authorized edition of the public acts, excluding all private, local, and personal acts, and all acts or parts of acts which have become obsolete, expired, or been repealed; to omit the enacting part from the preamble of every act and from every section; to refer in the margin of every act to any later act by which it has been modified; to divide the acts in the contemplated edition into four parts-first, those relating to England, England and Ireland, England and Scotland, or the United Kingdom; secondc, those relating to Scotland; third, those relating to Ireland; fourth, th6se relating to India, the colonies, or the other dependencies of the CROWNr. It is then proposed that three draughtsmen should perform each the whole of the work; beginning from the last volume of the statutes and working backwards, and that the work of these three draughtsmen should be compared together by way of correction. Lists mnst be made by them of obsolete laws, of laws the repeal of which is doubtful, and laws respecting the revival of which doubts may be entertained. Parliament should then be invited to pass an act resolving these doubts, and declaring that, except the acts contained in this edition, none other shall have any force or effect, and saving all things done under the acts which may be repealed. Such an authorized edition of the statutes would, it is computed, cost 101. or 121. if left in the hands of a bookseller, or about 50s. if printed like other Parliamentary papers; its bulk would be diminished from 40 quarto to 12 octavo :volumes, and it would be, from the perfection of its arrangement and the comparative brevity of its contents, easy of reference and perfectly accessible. Now, we ask those from whom we have a right to expect the accomplishmaent of great works of public utility, wvhether there be anything in. what is here proposed which is not perfectly practicable if set about in an earnest spirit, and with a thorough resolution to conquer al difficulties ? The labour is by no means so great as hundreds of men are daily encountering for the sake of the most insignificant private interests, while the result in this case would be to the public interests incalculably beneficiaL For the first time we should know what the statute law of England really is; for the first time we should be able to grasp it, and contemplate' it as 'a whole, free from the rubbish of accumulated ages by which it is buried and overwhelmeed a; but the utility of the measure would not stop here-we should' have gained a vantage ground, from which we should be able to carry system and order, as yet unknown, into the anarchy and confusion of our legislation. Once possessedof a bookwhich contained neither more nor less than the existing law of England, we could analyze its contents, divide those contents into groups, consolidate the law relating to each group, and digest it into a code. Such is the plan of the Law Amendment Society, which seems to lead us on, step by step, from our present miserable state of darkness and confusion to the most perfect order, method, and symmetry. All that is wanted is the selection of men competent to the task, a liberal remuneration of their exertions, and a clear view of the end to which those exertions are to be directed. Never was so easy an opportunity offered to a Government of obtaining boundless popularity at the present moment, and undying reputation in the times to come, as by appointing a Minister or Commission to complete the work thus ably and clearly sketched out.
The country has hitherto been content to pay its taxes without inquiring very minutely into the cost of collection. In our fits of economy we have narrowly scrutinized every item of expenditore; there has been higgling over shillings and pence, pensions have been denied, the army has been reduced to the lowest limit, the artillery was so neglected that it had almost 'to be created; the navy, too, had fallen so low that at the commencement of the war we had to man it hastily with raw lads and rheumatic coastguardsmen, and had fallen so fir behind the exigencies of the time that not until this year are we provided wlith the vessels best adapted for our purpose. But, while grumbling over our disbursements, we paid little attention to thel expenses of collecting our enormous revenues. The returns presented to Parliament gaWe simply the net results after all the charges of collection had been defrayed. These charges 'amounted to millions of the public money; but the Treasury had the most absolute control over all the salaries and charges; Parliament never heard of the gross receipts, and took no account of the percentage expended in realizing the public income. The estimates for the Revenue departments, which are now published for the. first time, have therefore an unusual interest. We are about to kinow for the first time, the true amount of our taxation. ln the estimate forthe Customs, forthe Inland Revenue, and for the Post-office, we findthat' the servioe of the ensuing year requires more than 5,000,0001.; the net revenue of these departments, aceording to the last returns, was 38,500,0001.; and the-gross product of these taxes --may easily be ascertained by adding together those figures. The estimates are very minute, and give the most interesting details regarding 40,000 persons engaged in the civil service of the country-from the. chairman who gets 2,500!. a-year to' the charwomiin who gets 251.; from the PosrTsMsn-Gzran, who receives 501. a-week, to the lettercariier at York who gets his 2s. 6d.'; frorii the London. Post-office, that costs 355,0001. a-year, to the- post-office -at Cloghran that costs 51. -It is trueothat these estimates do not give all tho expenses. About t1Leequarters of'a niillion, for example,' are required for the packet 'service of the TPost-office; but that sum is charged in the estimates prepared by the Naval Department. j On the other hand, the 5,000,0001.! -which wve have mentioned is 'not all- spent in salaries; about half a million of it goes to charg'es for superannuations and compensations. - The Customs emnploy 11,292 persolis, and the proposed expenses of the department, exclusive of superannuations, amount to 1,326,0001. Of this sum 840,0001. goes to'the Customs proper; the remainder to the Coastguard. In London alone more than 2,000 men are employed in the service of the former department, and the expenses of the different establishments amouint to 383,0001. _n Liverpool 844 men are ' required, and the charge is 115,0001. After Liverpool, the port that employs the greatest number of men is Hull; the number is 170, and their expenses are 18,0001. Exclusive of London and Liverpool, the number of Custom-house officers at the different ports and creeks of the united kingdom is 2,584; their salaries are 267,0001.; and, including salaries, the whole expenses of the establishments are 326,0001. Inclusive of London and Livorpool, the number of Custom-house officers is 5,564. The Coastguard employs a itill greater number-5,728, at an expense of 486,0001. Of this sum the annual charge for 51 revenue cruisers is 70,000L., or 1,5001. a-piece, if we include some minor charges, such as 3001. for-a superintendent of cruisers' repairs. On the whole, then, if we add to the last returns of the Customs, which were 20,987,000l., the charges for working the department, it would appear that the gross receipts are more than 22,500,0001., and that the expense of collecting this revenue is about 7 per cent. The expenses of the Inland Revenue depart.ment are (excluding superannuations) 1,522,0001., and the service employs 6,687 men. Of course, a great part of this sum is expended not in salaries, but in rent, in buildings, in postage, in rates. The new buildings at Somerset-house absorb 60,0001. Our taxgatherers pay rents, rates, and taxes, amounting to 12,0001. The postage and carriage of books and parcels come to 23,0001. The expenses of the cabs of London are 11,000!. Printing and gumming the little receipt and draught stamps, together with the price of the paper, cost 10,0001. Copies of wills cost 10,0001., and if they cost the Board of Inland Revenue that sum-query, what do the public pay ? Stage-carriage plates and allowances for checking stage-carriage journeys amount annually to 2,0001. The Excise returns for the last year wero 16,389,0001., and, adding these charges together with the superannuation allowances, the gross receipts amount to 18,130,0001. ; and this is collected at a charge of about 10 per cent. But a far more interesting department than either of these is that of the Post-office, which gives employment to 22,748 individuals, -which requires an outlay of 1,740,483!. (exclusive of superannuations), and which affords a clear revenue of 1,137,0001. The General Post-office in London costs 355,8001.; in Dublin, 37,3001.; in Edinburgh, 25,4271.; and then, descending still lower in the scale, Liverpool costs 20,9001. ; MIanchester, 16,8001.; Glasgow, 13,8001.; Birmingham, 10,3001. London employs 1,879 sorters, lettercarriers, and messengers, at an avenage pay of 691.; Dublin, 178, at an average pay of 671.; Edinburgh has 141, at an average pay of- 601. The clothing for the London lettercarriers cost last year 3,6001., and is to cost in the current year .5,0001. The difference in Dublin is not so great; it cost last year 2561., and the new estimate is 3071. But in Edinburgh the difference is very extraordinary. It cost last year 321. (surely a mistake), and the new estimate is 5001. In other words, the clothing of 141 lettercarriers in Edinburgh is to cost considerably more than that of 178 in Dublin. To proceed, however, the Money-order office in London costs 23,0001. ; in Edinburgh (including the accountant's office), 5,8371. ; 'in Dublin (includingv a similar office), 6,857!. All is mentioned with great minuteness. The policemen and firemen in London receive 1,1571.; andthose who are curious to know how 'much -the stamper at Norwich is paid, how much the clerks at BeLfast get, and how many lettercarriers they have at Cork, may very soon be satisfiea by dipping into these estimates. The London and North-Western Railway Company obtains 56,5001. a-year for the conveyance of mails-the largest - sum ,given to any one railway company. The GreatSouthern-and Western in Ireland seems to receive the next largest sum33,0001. In all,348,000l. arfgivenfortheconveyance of mails by railway through England; and, as a sign of the times, it is interestingto compare this sum with the charge for conveyance of mails by mail coaches-2,0921. See the difference in a single year ; last year it was 2,497. Another interesting item is that' of the manufacture of postage stamps. The total amount required for this manufacture is 30,0001.-a little fortune. The cost of the paper alone for, labels and envelopes is 13,5001.; the printing and gum-. ming cost 4,5001. more. The superintendent of the perforation gets 1001. a-year. In all, adding together the net revenue and the expenses of working the department, the gross receipts of the Post-office would appear to be 2,900,000?., and this revenue to be collected at a charge of 601. per cent.-a very large percentage, no doubt, if we regard the Post-office simply as a source of revenue; but it is much more than a source of revenue; it is the instrument of a great public service, and it would become intolerable if it sought the enormous gains of a public ta.
The Earls of LvucAN and CArDIGQA are very busily engaged in preparing their answers to the statements of the Crimean Report, but we must not lose sight of the inportant fictthat merely loose and general replies can never constitate au answer to the allegations of the Commissioners and the testimony of the witnesses. The Earls whose conduct is impugned may, and most probably will, broadly dleny the statements of the fegimental officers; but we know not why their statements should be received as truth in opposition to the assertions of officers who were in qpite as good a position-as they could be for appreciating the actual condition of affairs. 'What is wanted is that some perfectly impartial tribunal should hear the 'statements both in accusation and defence, and- decide up6n whicli silde right lies. 'What prisoners what defendant in any rimmald- or civil case,. does not presume that he has macle out 'a perfectly triumphant defence if his own statements may be admittedl without contradiction? At 2the present moment it so happens that many of the offilers who gave their evidence before the Crimean Comnmisioners are actually in this country, and can be examined in the interest of the Earlsi or cross-examined in the interest of tlSe nation.. They, at least; may receive an extension of leave. There is no suggistion that, in aiiy--case -active -hostilities. are to be resumed for many weeks to come, and it can -scarcely be said that the calls of 'military duty are so imiperative as to require the istant, departure from this country of gentle. men who can give material evidence. Let it l !be clearly understood, in order ta avoid any recur. Fren6e of the futile discussion which occurred the other night in the House of Peers, that the mere prowess and personal couirage of the Earls are not caled in question. Lord LucA. hadnoopportunity. for displaying his valour; it would be preposterous to fix any imputation upon him on this score. Lord CAmRLAi; rode in as straightforward a manner ovel the bloody lists of Balallava as any trooper under his command; he could not have done better ; and withb this acklnowledgment, which we make in simple truth and sincerity, we pams on -to the points really at issue. The charge against tho Earls is, that by reason of their impr6vident administration the British cavalry in the East was destroyed. The horses were starved, uselessly and idly exposed, not put under shelter when shelter might have been procured or contrived; the cavalry force -was, both in Bulgaria and in the Crimea, injudiciously handled; it was exposed and fatigued when there was no occasion for exposure or fatigue, and the end was that the work of the enemy was as effectualy done by Lords LucAw and CAnDxGAN as it could have been by the Princes !IxSscHmorF and GOBTSCHAxOPF. In order that we may not be acused even now of advancing charges without proper evidence in support, we will take a few statements at random 'from th-e evidence. Colonel DAFnY GBYF=, of the Scots Grays, was examined by the Commis. sioners. This officer states that immediately after the 14th of Novemberhe mentioned to Lord LucA;r that his horses were beginning to suffer from the inclemency of the weather; but we had better give the gallantColonel's own words. HetolaiorndLucmq. "that he was afraid he should lose a great many "horses if something was not done to protect them, "and that if he could hold out any encouragement "to his men to the effect that they were to remain "for any length of time in the camp which they "then occupicd, he could get them to erect some "covering to save them, when his lordship threat5ened to place him under arrest for presumling to "msggest Smelc a thing." The Earl of Luc2i-, it appears,like PrinceTAi vxwD, "objected to zeaL." Colonel GiEtrrir, as though any voucher were waiited for his bare word, adds that the conversa. tion occurred in the presence of Colonel HoDno; of Lord WsriwA PATrLT, andl others. It is his firm opinion that if the suggestion had been acted on he should have saved many of the horses which were lost. He attributes tne mortality among his horses to starvation, hard work, and exposure. At last Colonel Gamr succeeded in getting the remains of his regiment under sheds, " the first "of them about the 3d of January-having em"ployed, at his own expense, five French soldiers "to erect them-and had them completed abont the nmiddle of January." So what would have been required to preserve the horses of the Scots Grays was an amount of shelter whvich was ultimately provided by the exertions of five men; but against such a step Lord LucAw deternminedly set his face. It appears.that poor Colonel G Bu=H, being -very hardly pressed to get up his sheds in time, in tha early part of January applied to General ScAmr to procure for him the assistance of some ships' carpenters, as there were no carpenters in the regiment. This request for the assistance of men of whom many hundred were idle in the ships within sight was, of co use, refused, not' by Genera1 ScAXLErr, who made the application, but by the Quartermaster-General, Sir ICnARD. iREY! ! We turn over a few leaves of the Report and come to the evidence of theDeputy-Assistant-Commissary. General, Ais rXANEP CROOXI;HN. Would any of our readers wish to know the end of the Light Cavalry Brigade-the remains of the heroic frenzy of Balaklava ? Here it is:-" After twenty days "of short rations, the horses being at the same "time exposed to very inclement weather on un"favourable ground, the condition of the troop. "horses was deplorable. When the brigade "moved down on the 2d of December it w7as "necessary to have the horses led, as they were too "weak to carry their riders, and, notwithstanding, "many of them died on the way from exhaustion, "and a considerable number were left on the "ground, unable to move, -with men to attend "to them. The cause of this great deficiency " in forage for the brigade was the want of " transport to carry it to the front. Belieres there "swverw as a2y want of barley at Balaklavc, and 5that the horses inight, therefore, have had their "full rations of grain if there had been any means " of carrying it to the camp t At least the horses might have been led to the barley, if the -barley could not be carried to the horses. Thus there was an end of the Light Brigade. The blame of its wanton destruction rests partly among four officers on the day of the futile charge of Balaklava, and, next, upon those officers who starved the horses which returned from that bloody fray. What was Lord CARDIaANS share in this latter transaction?

TOT.AL -UOCTION 0F THE PAvmmoN THEATRE. -Yesterday morning, a fewv minutes before S o'clock, it was discovered that the Royal Pavilion Theatre was on fire. In the course of a few minutes the parish engino attended, as well as that of the brigado from Wedlclosesquare; but by that period the whole of the " flies" wrere in a reguIar blaze, and the burning drapery was falling thickly uponthe stage. The two engines w-ere set to work from an abundant supply of water fiurnished by the East )ondon Company. Before, however, a drop of water could touch the fire, owing to the many lengths of hose required to be attached to the engines the flames had extended to the whole of the scenery and mnachinery uron and tmder the stage. Ataidman, the engineer *ho had charge of the brigatf? engine, finding that it would be impossible to extinguish the conflagration with two engines, sent off to te more distant stations for additional aid. Forthwith other engines from Jeffrey-square, Watlingstreet, and Fardingon-streetstations arrived, aswell as that of the WVest of England Insurance Company from the Waterloo-road, Lambeth. Under the direction of Mr. Superintendent Braidwood, 'Jr. Fogo, the foreman of the A distrct, and Mr. Connorton, the foreman of the West of lnglancd office, the firemen went to work in admirable style, and by conveying the hose through tho different entrances to the theatre, and over the roofs of the surronnding houses, they were enabled to throw the water in the riglht direction; but, notwithstanding, in less than half an hour after the first appeance of the fire the tlames had seized upon the pit and also the boxes and proscenium. To stop the fire at those places the firemen exerted themselves to the utmost, but unfortunately without the least success. and in the course of a few mninutes more the confgration reached the roof, and seizing the chandelier, it suddenly fell into the middle of the pit, where the crystal drops soon became melted. The flames by a quarter to 9 o'clock were at their height, for every part of the theatre, except the dressingrooms in Baker's-row, presented one immense body of fame, and the glass chandeliers in front of the boxes kept cracking and falling in rapid succession, when of a sudden the roof fell vith a noise liko a clap of thunder. The flames, on the roof falling, mounted so Ingh into the air as to bo visible for miles distant, and by 10 o'clock every part of the establishment was reduced to a heap of smoking ruins. Mrs. Connorton, the proprietress of the buildin, was insured for machinery, wardrobe, and the theatre in the Phcenix and Monarch Fire-offices. Messrs. Elphinstone and Neale' the present lessees, who have lost a vast quantity of property by the disastrous event, were not insured for a single penny. As to the origin of the misfortune nothing that could be depended upon could be ascertained. The previous right a p-iece called the aed CroZw was performed, which terminated with the burning o, the Robin Hood Tavern, and it is not unlikely that some of the burning embers may have remained smouldering during the night. An immense crow-d assembled near the fire, and it required a powerful body of police to keep a way clear for the firemen. By 6 o'lock last evening the firemen succeeded in getting the rnins sufficiently cooled to allow an inspection to be made of the remaining portions of the premises, for the purpose of tracing out, if possible, the precise cause of the outbreak. So extensively, however was everythingwithin the walls burnt that it was impossible to toll how or invwhat part of the theatre the fire comnmnenced. The whEole of the performers empmloyed on the establishmnent have lost their wrdrobes, whEich alone wrill amounlt to a considerable sunm, and, wavht is still worse, none of the aortistes or others employed in the theatre were insured, and many, having large families dependent upon them for support, will suffer to no little extent We understand that Mr. Doug1as, the respected proprietor of the Great National Stahnda Theatre, Shoreditch, and some other managers intend to get up benefits in aid of the families of the burnt-out performers. TES FxTAL Conriox on' FoLuEsTo-Ez.-The inquiry opened on Tuesday last, before Mr. East, a Folkestone coroner, respecting the death of three of the unfortunate sufrers in the wreck of the Josephine Willis, as restned yesterday at the GuIdhall of that borough. Mr. W-inework and Captain Nea3le attended on behalf of the owners and underwriters; ir. Towne for Captain Bourchier; and Mr. O'Shee for the }imerick and London Steampacket Company. The evidence was almost the same as given at the Deal inquiry. The jury, after more than an hour's deliberation, returned the following verdict:-" We come to a unanimous conclusion that George Suniners and others came by their deaths in consequence of a collision between the ship Josephine Wilis and the steamer Mangerton, owing to an error in judgment on the part of the chief officer of the ship, mistaking the light of the steamer for Duncss Light, and starbearding the helm. We also agree that if a proper lookout had been kept on board of the steamer, the collision might have been avoided. We feel it our dutyas to statethat there appears to have been a reat wnt of humanity on the part of the crew of both ahie mnnot sending assistance to the passengers of the ship whle they had itetheir povier to do so; andwe believe that, if rproper efforts had been made, many more lives would have been saved." SHocm1e;Q AccsDz:NT.-An accident attended with a serious los of life occurred at Bowtheck Slate Quarries, near Camelford, a few days ago. Upwards of 100 fathoms of rock at the back of the quarry suddenly r way, and three men named Pasco Josldn, John aters, and Youlton were crushed to death. Soveral others narrowly escaped ; and if all the men employed at the quarry had been in their usualplaces a large number would in all probability have lost thair lives. TEmE AppPr S To THE Houss Or LoRDs FROM mx SCOTCG COIMTS,-We trust that the discussions in the House of Lords, in reference to the hereditary branch of the Legislature and the bestowal of a life peera"e on Baron Parke, w>il have the effect of directing nbRie attention on both sidles ofthe Tweed to the absurdities of the present systemofapeals fromtheCourt of Session to the House of LordsL. othingimoreanomalous or ridiculous can be imagined than to permit one judge, the Lord Chancellor, however eainent and distinguished as an English lawyer, to make havoc of decisions arrived at by the entire judicial mind of the supreme bench of Scotland. Hear what Lord Lyndhurt, himself the most accomplished jurisconsult inthe House, sd, on Thursday last, of the man who presides over, or rather possesses, the appelate jnis. irtio:ofthe last court o' resort:-"As to the law of scotlar.d,i e(the Lord Chancel.or) never has been conversant with it, and he has had ino connexion with the administration of justice in the courts of equity ;" and yet this is the peBOn who overhauls our jadgmentz, turns them upside down, adoptt them, rejects them, or splits them in two-in short, lays down anything a3 the law of Scotland, according to his sovereign will and pleasure.

SECOND EDITION. THE TIMES OFFICE, Thuraday Mo'ning. : EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris corrn spondent, dated yesterday, 6 p.m. :_ Baron Brunow arrived here last night, at half. past 10 o'clock, bythe express train from Strasburg, and took up his quarters in the Hotel. of the Russian Emb.ssy in the Faubourg St. Honors. Some groups wero collected at the-terminus to see him. I have reason to know that three days ago he was not expected before the end of the week. The Russian appears to have "stolen a march" onus; I hope we shall not have to say the same at the end of the month. M. de Bourqueney has already arrived, but has left for Blois to bring up his family. It is to be hoped that Lord Cowley will, on his return to Paris, bring Lord Clarendon with him. Tho gentleman who remains iu temporary charge may, for aught that is known to the contrary, be a match for Baron Brtuiow, or Count Nesselrode himself, but it is remarked as odd that hardly had the English Ambassador arrivel in London when the Russian Plenipotentiary rashes in breathless haste to Paris. He will have the field to himself for two or three days. The Englsh Plenipotentiaries are expected at the end of the week: the sooner they come the better. Count Buol will be here on Triday or Saturday, so at least it is given out. AL Cavour leaves Turin to-day, and will probably arrive on Friday, but the resident Sardinian Minister, the Marquis de Villa Marina, is on the spot, and keeps a good look-out. Count Buol vill not, it is feared, get so easily into his apartment at the Hotel de la Terrasse as was supposed, as the party occupying it declines to give it up, notwithstanding the mighty interest involved in having the Austrian Plenipotentiaries comfortably housed. A disappointment of the kind sours a man's temper, and it is important to Europe that those on whom its destiny depends should hold their first meeting in a calm and equable condition of mind and stomach. Early this afternoon some calls wero made at the Russian Embassy; but Baron Brunow was said to be reposing after the fatigues of his jouney. I have no faith in the repose of Russian diplomatists. Such men never sleep; or, if they do, it is wxith both eyes open. Aali Pasha, the Ottoman Plenipotentiary, will not ariTve before the 18th or 19th. Turks do not travel by the electric telegraph like Russians. It is still doubted whether it be possible for the Conferences to begin on the 20th. A.very handsome table has been fitted up at the Foreign-office for the Plenipotentiaries to sit at during the Conferences. It is covered with rich crimson velvet, and, together with the chairs, forms a handsome piece of furniture. It was at first only large enough to accommnodae eight persons; but then Sardinia and Turkey had only one Plenipotentiary each. Since the decision in favour of tvwo, it has had to be lengthened, and now is large enough for 12. The two additional places are, no doubt, meant for Prussia, if Prussia behave herself as she ought. Ihavo already mentionel that Count Walewsld, as Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Sovereign in whose capital the Conferences are held, will preside. It is said that one of the first acts of the Emperor of Russia after the signature of the treaty of peace, should we be so happy as to see it, will be the formal notification to France and England of his accession to the throne. In diplomatic fiction, these Powers, it seems, are supposed to believe that the Emperor Nicholas is stil living. The M0oniteusr de la 17ofte publishes the following letter from the Crimea, dated the 30th ult.- "' The steam corvette Phlegeton, commanded by Captain Russell, arrived at Kmlesech on the 2.th, from Kinburn having on board the Generalof Artillery Lebceuf, who re. maained 24 days on a tour of inspection in the Daleper. The situation of the expeditionay troops is exceUent, and the enemy, who, according to credible information, Intended to attack us, had made no hostile demonstration, to the great annoyance of our soldiers and seamen, who were thus disi appointed in their hope of gaining a new victory. The temperature had become considerably milder, and the thermometer, which had faUen at one miment to 25 deg. below the -freezing point, now ranges between 2 and 4 deg. above that point. The ice had lost march of its solidity, and the people of the country beievel that its brealingup would take place much earlierthan usuaL The sanitary condition of the garrison and the crews of the aotiDla was excellent. During the winter, amusements and exercises conducive to the health of the men had been organized on the ice. Fowling hadaiso proved a great resource Birds of passage had been most abundant. The river was frozen across since the commencement of winter, but the communications on the side of the Black Sea were not an instant interrupted with Kamiesch, a circumstance which enabled us to victual the place with perfect regularity. General Leboauf had inspected all the works of defence with the greatest care, and found them in a very efficient condition. The supply of the batteries was more than sufaicient for every eventuality. Three days before the departure of the corvette for Kamiesch, an extraordinary courier from St. Petersburg had brought to Odessa the news of the acceptance by the Emperor Alexander of the Austrian itimetumn. This intelligence had produced the greatest sensation on the entire population of the city. In the evening, with the authorization of Count Strogonoff, Governor-General of Southern Russia, aU the houses bad been illuminated, and on an immense transparency, placed over the front of the Exchange, were inscribed these words .-' Long live the Emperor Alexander LT. ! Hie enjoys the affection and gratitude of his people.' From Odessa the news spread like lightning throughout the country, and was bailed everyv-here with similar satisfaction. It was particularlygrateful to tle countrypeople, who stand so much in need of peace and tranquillity. At the winter fair of Aleschki, near Cherson, one of the most important in the country, and wlhich usually lasts three days, the moment the event became known, provisions of every description, which the day before found no buyers, were eagerly inquired after, and the market closed at a rise of 30 per cent., on the opening prices. Those symptoms prove that theresolution of the Emperor meets the approbation of the people. Previons to the arrival of the St. Petersburg courier, an order had been addressed to all the authorities of Southern Russia to supend the levies of recruits, and that order was generally reCarded as an indication of peace." We read in the Indepesrdaswe Beige, under date of Haniburg, 8th inst. - "The land mail of the Russian Baltic provinces arrived to-day at HIamburg. bringing letters from Revel of the 2d and from Riga of the 4th inst. The commercial relations Of those ports, then free from the ice which obstructedtheir entrance a few days before,had become extremely active, particularly with Sweden,Denmark, andtheGermantowasalong the Baltic coast. Several merchantmen belonging to English I houses had already sailed forHulland otherharbours of Great Britain, with full cargoes of oil seeds, tallow, &c. Others were being loaded for the same destination, at Baltic Port and Bolderaa, in defiance of the proclamation of the Queen of England, declaring traitors the subjects of her Crown who should trade with Russia before peace had reestablished international relations between the two countries. On the other hand, several cargoes of English coal had already reached Revel and Riga. The -merchants of those two Russian cities offered to sell by contract, as usual, quantities of grain at prices much inferior to the present reduced rates, but the foreigners evinced no disposition to purchase the article, which was to be delivered next May. Everybody expects that cereals will undergo a still greater depression at that period. There are in the decked boats, serving as stores during winter, and stationed in all the rivers of the Baltic provinces, immense supplies of grain and seeds, which are to be landed in the Russian harbours the moment the thaw sets in. There will ba then such a superabundance of corn that prices must necessarily experience a further declne, and this is the prineipe reson why foreign merchants abstain at this moment from making extensive purchases.

PRUSSIA (FnoMa OUR OWN COnussONDZET.) BERI;N, FEB. 11. It will, perhaps, be in the recollection of your readers that I have at various times of late reported the (what we should call) unconstitutional interference of the Prussian Government with the freedom of electors on occasion of the late general elections in this country. At the commencement of the present session of the two Houses of the Diet the subject was brougght before the notice of the House of Deputies by Count Schwerin, incidentally to the in. vestigations into the validity of certain elections; since then he has, supported by 90 members holding the ame views, brought in a motion, that " the House expects the Ministry will set on foot an inquiry as to how far the freedom of the late election has been circumscribed by the intervention of the organs of the Government, and communicate its result to the House of Deputies." In the Committee to which this motion was referred for preliminary deliberation, Count Schwerin put forward the principle, that it was an essential of Constitutionalism that the views prevalent among the people should be allowed to be brought to the knowledge of the King and his Govern ment by means of the elections, and unperverted by any external influences. On the other hand, the Minister of the Interior showed that general elections are always periods of excitement, produced by the agitation of conflicting parties; that it is the duty of the Government to take measures to keep under this excitement, and its right as well as duty to avail itself of its own employes for that purpose; that the best way to reue the people at large from the agitation of conflicting political parties is to put forward and procure the election of Deputies devoted to the Government. The fact of the Govern. ment having exercised an active influence on the elections was not denied for a moment; the Minister of the Interior communicated his o-n rescript, issued to all the officials connected with his own Binistry, and admitted that those issued by other Ministers were of the same tendency. Tho empToYs were called upon, as in duty bound to their employer the State, to exert themselves to procure the election of the Government candidate, and as regarded themselves, if their conscience3 and con victions prevented them from voting for that candidate, they might abstain from voting at all; but it could not be permitted that they should put themselves into an oppositional attitude to the Govern ment by voting for an Opposition candidate. In contradiction of the constitutional principle put forvard of the right of every subject to his freedom of election, it was alleged that the official employj6 by entering into the service of the Government, renounced the entire freedom of election enjoyed by the mere subject, and was bound by law to do the will of the Government in every particular. As -all the facts of undue interference imputed to officials were admiited, with the exception of some glaring instances of police intimidation, &c., which were disavowed by tho Minister, and as the Govern. ment justified the- course of the officials as having been comnanded by superior authority, and endem voured to justify the Government for the course I had taken, the motioni for inquiring into the con duct of the officials was felt to be pointless and un' necesary,andtheCommitteerocommended the House to pas to the order of the day. This apparent blunder in the direction given to the motion was,- h6weovcr; a matterof necessity; any attempt to bring in a motion for the express incrimination of .the Ministers would certainly hate been rejected by tho overwhelmig m&jo-ity of the Right side; or had it passed, and everything been proved'againist them, there is xtiU no,law to enforce the responsibility of Ministers, or in 'any way to call them to account, although the bstract- principle of their responsibility was laid down in.the Charter, a-Ad was at the time intended to have been converted into a reality. The commission itself charged withthe preluminary discussion of the Schwerin motion, was constituted exclusivelyof membersof the Right side, which seems to have impressed tho Count himself with a conviction of the hopeleasnessofanysuccesthere,andtohaveinfluenced him to reserve all the facts in support of his allogations for the debate which would be raised on it in the House. Of this debate, which took place last Thursday and Friday, and ended in the rejection of the Schwerin motion by a majority of 203 agm-st 92 for the motion, I beg to offer you some notices of the inost prominent features, as no mere remarks of a correspondent can contributeso well to the formation of a correct judgment of the present polity of Prussia as these authentic and authoritative expressions. We are accustomed iu England, at any rate since the Revolution here, to look upon Prussia as the champion of constitutional freedom on the continent.; this debate shows us, in corroboration of what I have often reported to yot, that instead of its form of government being a limited constitutional monarchy, it is an absolute monarchy limited only by the conscience and good qualities of the Monarch, with a Charter and Chambers as a mask to the absolutism. That the actual action of the Government is mild and beneficent, and that of a the bureaucratical hierarchy not tyrannical or excessively vexatious, is beside the present point, which is the distinct proof, as educed from the recent debate, that constitutional freedom and parliamentary government do not exist here. In the course of the first day's debate it was shown that the course pursued by the Govermment for the purposo of influencing the votes of the electors in favour of the Government candidates had consisted in thesuppression of all political periodicalsthathad held a free and liberal language; in the threatened or actually executed withdrawal of concession from certain nlwspapers and printers; in the r- arrangement of the electoral districts, so as to split any unfavourable localmajority, and append the divided elements to neighbouring districts where they would be in the minority; in the employment of local employs to influence the elections; and in the intinidation by the police. The place of election wvas in some cases fixed on the boundary of the province, and when the voters grumbled at having had to travel 14 or 15 miles to vote, they wore told that if they voted for the Government candidate their travelUing and other expenses would be paid them. In districts where public works, such as bridges, &ac., were looked for at the hand of the Government, the electors were assured upon authority, that they would get no bridges if the Government candidate were not elected. Privy Councillor Hahn, as Commissary of the Government, having been specially entrusted with the subject of the electionsintheMinistryof theInterior, commenced his defence of the Government by declaring that no party in the country had approached the elections with 'purer and graver convictions and intentions than the Government; that the latter had carefuly avoided every measure that could be only justified. as political without being strictly moral. The Government joins issue with the abstract principle put forward by the mover, that the sense of the people shall find its expression in the elections, but denies that there is any such conscious political sense at present extant among the great bulk of the people; its occupation and its degree of intellectual developement prevent it from having any convictions on party questions; it has only indistinct notions. The only psychological manifestation in connexion with politics which is evident throughout the whole psople, in all classes, is love and gratitude to the Throne. This is the only true existing public OpiniOn in Prussia, and is just now enhanced by special thankfulness for the preservation of the blessings of peace to the land; the party that lays so much stress upon the value of public opinion has% however, carefully abstained from introducing this question of peace or war on the hustings. The Government is convinced of the people being attached to the throne, and has only done its duty in affording to this feeling an opportunity for its demonstration, and at the same time in saving it from the agitation of parties which speculate rather on its ignorance and inexperience than on its convictions and feelings. For the purpose of anticipating the practices of political agitators the Government had by turns had recourse to the three classes of measures that have been made the subject of complaint; the re-arrang ement of the electoral districts, the screw put upon the press, and the action exerted by officials throughout the country. When any tendency of party, nationality, or religion was found to be pre-eminent in an electoral district the latter has been divided, so that the real public feeling, loyalty, might have room for manifestation; tho screw put upon the press was only tightened when the democratic -party raised its ihead; the press had already deserved worse at the hands of the Government, which had only held hands up to that time from observing that the population in the provinces did not read the papers and showed a total apathy on the subject. The result of the activity of the Landrathe raising the Royal banner in the provinces was, that the population, instead of being led astray by party agitation, knew where they were to go to flock into the camp of their King and his Government. The L-ndrath is the confidential counsellor and friend of the rustic and the smallyeoman. Nothing so natural as that these classs should look to the Landrath for advice in this important action of election; theinfluence of the Landrathe has been exerted amply and beneficially, and most particularly indistricts where religious denominations formed compact political parties (Catholics); and neit after them in circles where the elements of personal respect and traditional deference (Count Schwerin), were found on the side of the opposition. The interference of the executive police must not be laid to the blame of the Government, seeing"that'the latter had not sought for nor wished its services on this occasion. LWhere it hadmeddled the easeswere under investigation, and already in some cases the parties had been punished; and the Etouse had certainly noecause to complain of Government candidates having been benefited by this action of the police. Asregards the intimation conveyed to Government officials to vote for Government candidates or not at all, which had been pronounced unconstitutional, it was averred that the official is bound by his oath first and foremost to serve the King and his Government; the Constitation (Charter) does not repeal this oath, but only confers on him in common with others the priviiege of voting ;-this gineral privilege, ho'wef:er, he must not be allowed to exercise at. the expeinse of his paiticular and special duty of support!iia the Government. The Ministry, so long as it is in offiee, is. not to be separated from the Throne in the feelings of the- people; the Ministers are the servants of.the- King and executors -of his will;Athe Ministry is not a constitutional middle-thing, standing between the King and the people; they are the King's own highest officers, and are entitled to claim for their office the consideration and respect folt by tho people-for the Royal power. As to the individual instances, in wlhich the exercise of Ministerial influence had not been specified, no investigation of them could be' entered into, but if it .as intended by this motion to attack the system of the Government, the house had now a full statement -what the principles of that system were, and would, the speaker had no doubt, pass over the motion to the order of the day. * - I It will be ewident to your readers from the above abstract of the speech made by the Government Commissary in justification of the Ministry, that although ther6 is still a talk at times about a Constitution in Prussia, this Constitution is nothing but a modern charter,the most liberalparagraphs of which (as recent letters of mine have xbown) are mi daily course of erasure; that the MEnisters, although pro. nounced in the abstract to be responsible, are practicallynot so; that they are the executors of theKing's will, the chefs de ddpartemens, to whom theRing gives his instructions ; that the Ministry is removable'only by the King, and not by any adverse Parliamentary majority; that the whole hierarchy of officials throughout the country is held to be bound to carry out the measures of the Ministry, as the organs of the King's will, not only in the specific duties of their office, but in their general standing and behaviour; that the result of the late elections has been to send into the House an overwhelming majority of men bound by duty and inclination to follow the King's commands as conveyed to their knowledge by the Ministry, not to make opposition to them; that the bulk of the people of Prassia much prefers being governed to governing itself; that devotion to the King, submission to the Ministry, deference to the whole official hierarchy, and prostration before the police and military, render the spread of anything like political freedom and progress in this country an impossibility, unless the impulse thereto be given from above. RUSSIA. A letter from St. Petersburg, of the 3d, in the ns2lstitufkms, says:- The Inzwlidt Russ, in its number of tho Ist, published lctters of thanks addressed to General xomantoff, tho Hetman of the Cossacks, by the Emperor and the Empresses FWdorowna*and Maria, on the occasion of the congratulations sent to their Imperial Majesties by the Cossacks of the Don on Now Year's Day. These rescripts arerepeated everyyear, and I therefore abstain from sending you the text of them. GeneralGortschakoffinhisturnhasbecomeone.ofthefamiliars of the Grand Duke Constantine. I am assured that itis owing to the influence of the Crimean Generalissimo that such a change has been produced in a few days in the ideas of the yonng Grand Duke. General Gortschakoff has pointed out to him so clearly the dangers of the present war that the brother of the Emperor in the end saw that he had been hitherto pusning a wrong course. It is said that he is new more in favour of peace than even the Czar him. self. A medal of honour is about to bo distributed to the sisters of charity who, during the siege of Sebastopol, gave proofs of such courage and humanity. These excellent women, whose devotedness and abnegation were displayed in such an extraordinary manner, well merit this distinction. General Gortschakoff related to the two Empresses and to the Grand Duchesses the admirable conduct of these ladies, and urged the Governmnet to send them a striking mark of its satisfaction. The Emperor, in consequenee, decided that a commemorative medal should be awarded to each of them; and the EmpressandtheGrand Duchess Helen addressed autograph letters to the superior of the sisterhood. Adjutant-General Bibikoff x-Minister of the Interior, has just resigned his -rank in the army and retired to his estates. An Imperial uase has been published, stating that the time passed by soldiers of the army of the South in hospital shall be counted in their period of active service. The Chancellor of the Empire has addressed another manifesto to the Russian Plenipotentiary at Vienna, on the occasion of the signatare of the preliminaries of peace, which, as we learn by telegraph, took place on the 1st in the capital of Austria. This document, like those of the 23d Decenber and the 5th January, bears the stamp of the pacific feelings of the Rus. sian Government. As far as regards Art. 5, it declares that Russia cannot concede more than the rectification of the frontiers of Bessarabia. As this is all tatsthe Western Powers demand, it is probable that no difficulty will arise on that point." Another letter from St. Petersburg of the same date says:- " The Regiment of Light Dragoons of princoPaskewitsch is to retain his name, but the other regiments which also bear his name are to take their previous denomination. The son of the Prince has been nominated Adjutant-General of the Emperor. The Emperor has ordered that in consequence of the bravery displayed by General Khrouleff at Sebastopol, his name shall be inscribed with those of other Generals in letters of gold on a marble tablet, wvhich is to be placed in the military school in which he studied. According to private letters from Simpheropol to the 24th ult., the fire of the batteiries on the north of Sebastopol was very vigorous. These letters express great astonishment at the rapid construction of the new French town of Kamiesch Formerly the site occupied by the town was a public promenade, known by the name of Eovaia Zemba (ewfoundland)." TIEE DA&UBIAN PRINCIPAIJTIES. The Boyards and clergy of ioldavia have addressed a petition to the Sultan against the illegal constitution of the present Government (Divan) Of Moldavia, and of the measures adopted by that body:- " Sire (says the petition), the situation is a serious one. As organs of the country, a longer silence on our part would be an act of culpability towards the sacred person of your Imperial Majesty and towards our posterity; and as we are not hearkened to here, we are nnder the necessity of having recourse to the benevolence of your Imperial Majesty, humbly supplicating you to deign to prohibit the Government ad hoc from usurping a character which does not appertain to it, and to annul all the acts it has comnitted beyond its competency, and to ordain that the country and its interests shall be ruled by the laws which existed here before this Divan was instituted, until the moment of reform shall have arrived which was promised to us by the Convention of Balta-Iiman."' " Sire (it concludes), we are convinced that the magnanimous solicitude of your Imperial Majesty wil not fail to deliver us from our actual sufferings, and that one of the eflects of that solicitude wll be to cause to be respected in futare the acknowledged rights of our country in consideration of the fidelity we hava vowed and will always voyeto the Sublime Porte." This petition bears the date of Jassy, 9th December, 1855, and the signatures of the Archbishop and of 314 Boyards of Moldavia. SPAIN. (FROM oUra ow COsslsoNDENT.)' MADRID, Fir. 9. The new Finance Minister has not yet announced the projected ways and means by which he expects to make up for the final repeal of the excise on produce. A dluty on the sale of spirituous liquors is expected to be proposed, and also that the duties now paid on various articles of general consumption on entering the gates of the principal towns wiU be extended to many other towns now not included in the list, but whether by these means alone or by the further imposition of some direct, tax, there is little doubt that Senor Santa Crux wiU conform to the vote of the' Cortes some time back, that the income anid expenditure should be brought to a level by the Government finding and bringing forward permanent sources of revenue for that object. The C-ortes have been occupied to-day, as usual on Saturdays, with questions aTed interpellatims. The only on og aiteeswsone gput by Senor Mariategui to the Financeo inister,* reipetisg a contract made by hispredecessor for'a pecuniary advance which it was his objeet to show was of an I onerous character. Senor Santa Criuz aid that he had no knowlege of the subject but would inquire into it. - Advantago has been taken of the bad effect produced by Senor Bruils going out to affect the funds stilrmore by heavy sales. It is-iaid, that powerful parties who are opposod to the intended conversion of the floating debt are acting in that sense. The Three per Cents. were done to-day at M75, and closed at 3S, and the Deferred ditto at 23.65. Senor Madoz (Don Pascnal), who is the editor of the large statistical and geographical dictionAry o£ Spain, estimates that if the electoral franchise be fixed at 120 reals in direct tames, including the property tax and that on trades and professions, anc adding to those who pay those taxes the parties wlh wil be qualified to vote as members of the learned professions, &e., the total number of electors it Spain will be about 700,000.

It is, how,ever, airtai tliati the fiatt has gotio fofth, and that', whethier Ocde be!anoexocl or' not, the reigniDg house will be deposed, and the entire administration intrusted to General Outram. Of liis competency to so great a trust some doubts hav. been entertained, but I think without~ sufficient reason. 7hough not a showryofficer, he has always proved himself equal to his wrork-, amid his sterling uprighltness gives his the weight *-hich natives always attach id decision o; character. "WYe wait with some anxiety to see if any effect is producti-' in England by Ute capture of Herat. Every detail of our intercourse with Persia is, as yotu are perhap3 aware, regulated in England, the Governo?-General-having no-c6ntrol over tho British lIinister at Tcheran. It seems to be believed here that it wli be consideed to afford a cas btdi, the Shah being pledged by solemn treaty not to attempt the conquest. tn the other hand,iitis assertedthat the capture, thoughl in riality a breach of that engagemetit, is not so in form. The Persians have not aasume-a the direct governnrenk of lerat. Yar LIahomed, the ruler with whonV we wer acquainted during the AflMhan war, hLd supplanted his m.ter, Shahl kanran. The sons of the deosed jSovereign have been for years depend,ent on the Persian Court, and have at last been ~employed as serviceable tools. One of them now rules Herat, and.so wll is the farce maintained that by the latest accounts the Shah has addressed to him 3 letter promising him favour and protection. The question seems to demand a settlement. Dost bIahomed holds his own, aad is sid to be inincessant co-munication with the British Government; but the Dost is growing old; ho cannot last many years longer; and at his death the country -wil be inevitably split into -factions, anyone of which may purchase a momentary suprmaicy by ofems of allegiance to Persia. The advance of that Power into Affighanistan, it cannot be too often repeoted, places the keys of the empire in the hands of a Court which loves Russian gold and trembles at Russian menaces. England and France may obtuin what treaties they please. Teheran is Russian until-thc Court finds it advantageous to throw off the yoke, which moat certainly has not been as yet the olac. "In nmere domestic affairs the mnost important event is tEe ntroduction of M1r. Grant's new Sale Law into the LegIslative Council. It will be difflicult, I fear, to give English readers an adequate idea oE the manitude of this event vvithout a somewhat leegthy description of the present tenure-of land in Bengal. Under the perpetual sett2ement the whole of }3engal hats been divided into estates held by ]an:dlords on the tenure of a fixed quitrent to the Company. While thiis rent is paid no act short of treason can deprive a proprietor of his estates. Should hc not pay up to the hour, however, his estate goes to the hammer. In practice few estates 3re thus sold,-and the tenure may be regarded as a free holding sulgiect to a land tax. These estates, hoevevr, are often of vast size. The landlord, often an absentee, cannot manage them himself. Farming, in the English sense, he- never dreams of, and the collection of rents from perhaps 100,000: cottiers-there are more than 2,000,000 on the Burdwan estate-is too heavy a task for an -Asiatic. lie sublets it for ever. The anbtenant, wvhomn we call a qTalookdar, holds of the Zeniindar, as the Zemindar holds of Government. In Engisha phrase, he has a perpetual lease from -the tenant of the Crown. Twro-tirds of the whole land of Bengal is thus held, including almost all the indigo factories, suga:r plantations, and European farms. The tenure would seem to an English farmer rational enough. Unfortunately, Lord Cornwallis, when he established the perpetual settlement, in orider to secure the Government rental arranged that, in the event of failure -to pay the quitrent, the sale should vitiate all encumbrances whatsoever. Whenever, therefore, an estate goes to the hammer every lease -upon it is ipso facto void. Because Stowe is sold, all the John Smiths on theproperty are deprived o the leaues they have paid for. The zemindars, thoroughlyaware ofthe law, use it in this fashion Tliey lease the lands to wealthy tenants, suffer them to raise the 'value of the property, fail to pay the quitrent, and at the consequent sale buy in their own estates, nader a false name, clear of all encumbrances. The threat of such a proceeding has actially been employed in one instance within my knowledge to extort money from the manager of a great indigo concern. Of coursewithauch a tenure improvement became impossible. Mcn awill not lay out capital in improving a property their rioht -to which may be destroyed at anv moment without any fault of their own. They considered themselves with justice as tenants-at-will instead of leaseholders. The evil has long been felt, but hitherto a reform has been considered impossible. It would be, it was alleged, a breach of the perpetual settlement. At last the evil became unendurable. Captain Craufurd, manager of the Indigo Company's affbirs, agitated the question vigorously. He demonstrated that the present tenure prohibited advance. The press took up the subject, asserting that a radical change would involve no breach of faitlh. Officials seized upon the question as soon as -there appeared a gleam of hope, and at last it asuned a practicaI form. A proposition was brought for- rd, strongly supported by the Govermnent of Bengal, for keeping leases inviolate in the event of a sale. So long as the money bid for an estate would cover the Government arrear the leases were to be held intact. The new proprietor would buy land subject to the leases upon it. Inthe event, however, of the sum bid not being sufficient to pay that arrear the leases must be,violated and the encumbrances cleared away. This proposal, it is evident, secured the leasehoIder in every event but one. A reckless Zemindar might grant away portions of his estate at peppercorn rents till nobody- would buy the whole subjec+ to such leaes. This contingency would be of frequent occurrence, an1d Mr. Grant therefore has proposed a new scheme. It goes farther than the former one, further than the boldest reformers have dared to hope. Mr. Grant propowe that every Talookdar, or permanent leaseholder, shallhave the nightto call in a Government surveyor. f- I this official on examination reports that the rent paid under the lease is sufficient to pay the Government rent, he is-secured for ever. hatever becomes of the estate his lease cannot be touched or his rent raised. - He is of course bound by his lease to pay the rent agreed on with his Iandlord to his landlord; but the Zemindar can no longer by fraud annul his own agreements, nor can he by fo~Iy cause the ruin of every one under him. Two-thirds of the land users-not landGwners-of Bengal thus exchange tenancy-at-will for a leasehold right. They have always contracted and paid for the latter form of tenure, but hitherto, from the defect of the law, have been unable to secure it "ThZe advantagae of this reform to the Zemindir is scarcely less than to -his tenit. It is in- security which hai kept down the price of Land in BengaL It is calculated that on the average almost all Zemindaries return a clear 25 per cent. upon the purchase-money; yet thousands - prefer the Government 5 per cent, simply for it3 security. In other words, the funds are held to be more secure than landed propertCy in the proportion of five to one. " Some other changes have been introduced, anl tending to increase the security of land, of which the following is, perhaps, tho most important-:Hitherto it has been dangerous for a great proprietor lo quit'his estate. His agent may want it for him-. elf. In that case he fails to.pay the Government reit. No subsequent payment is of any avail. The estate is put up to auction, and bought by a bidder aeAoywd bythe knavish agent. It isnow proposed -to permit the proprietor to deposit in the collector's hands any a Lount of Company's paper he pleases. Uip to ihe value of that paper h is safe. Ve may go to Egand for two years or ten, or,if hechoose4, lie may- deposit to much paper that the interest shall le equal to the Government rent. In thit case he as secure for ever, happen what may. "Ihave desried ths innovation at some length, but you Will readilyperoeive that it altem not only t ten-re of land, but thes whole constitution of siociety n-BengSal. In makes thie leaseholder a fre lan. ' deprives the landowner of a terrible lii-. strume4itof coercion, ejectment at 'will, the riht to which he had formly by his ow leaso abandoned.

The most important report, however,, has come down from etaaieelins The superintendent of that district, Dr. Campbell,. found veins of copper in rocks on the Mohapuddee. rTo test their value he advised that theyr should be leased out for a year. Government complied; s.nd, as the period has nearly expired, he has visited 'the rmines again. His report- on their condition is before me. The contractor, a native, has obtained some 2,000 lepaulese labourers and commenced operatio Galleries, supportedby wooden props, are cut into the rock, and the ore removed after the moyt primitive fashion. -It i5 smelted, and the produce ground to powfder, mixed with 'balls of cowvdung, and smelted again.'- The result of thisprinmitive process is a copper worth only 3 per cent. less than good English tile copper. The veins, some of them of wonderful richness, extend over 30 miles 'of country. Coal has been found in the neighbourhood, and the country for hundreds of square leagues is covered with fuel. Government is anLxious to lease the mines, and, if they really come up to the representations of Dr. Campbell, a most careful officer, they may be worthatntion in England.
FOREIGN INTELLIGEYCE. FRANE. (FROM OUR OWN- COREMSPONDENT. PARIS, TUEsDAY, FseL 12, 6 P.f. General de 3artimprey has left Paris for the Crimea, to resume his post of Chief of the Staff of Marshal Pelissier's army. A contradiction has been given, and apparently on authority, to the statement of some of the Mladrid papers that a conspiracy had been discovered in one of the regiments quartered in Vittoria, with ramifications m Burgos, San Sebastian, and other points. Some other inaccuracies were pointed out of no importance, but the principal fact is that the alleged plot had no foundation in trath. This may be the case; but, considering who has had the immediate direction of the army for so long a period, I should not be surprised at anything that may happen. A man in whose political honesty no onehasthe slightest confidence has had the mili- tary force of the kingdom under his immediate-, control, and is known to have been in uninterrupted correspondence with the principal plotters abroad. The Minister of War, O'Donnell, has been repeatedly remonstrated with on the im-; propriety and danger of maintaining the DirectorGeneral of Infantry in his post, and a mission at Lisbon was proposed for him. O'Donnell had always some objection or motive for delay. At one time: he declared that he could not separate from those who had fought by his side at Yicalvaro; and at another promised that the appointment should be made, but not yet a while. O'Donnell himself has much to do to make the partywith which he is allied forget his previous history; and during his Par- | lianentary conflict with the Marquis of Albaida the crimes of Cuba, the traffic in slaves, the extortions of every kind, the vast wealth acquired in a very few years-all these things have been once more exposed to the ridicule or indignation of the public. Whether military insurrections will take place in the army I know not; but it will not be owing to the want of exertion on the part of conspirators. I fear that matters are not considered by some of tle supporters of the party in power to be going on very well in Spain. In truth, nothing tan be more anomalous than the condition of the country. Th3 powers of the Crown are limited to a degree hardly known in any monarchical form of government, and in the exercise of her prerogative which belongs to it the Sovereign is powerless. But nowhere is the anomaly more remarkable than in the case of the two most prominent men now in Spain. Nothing can be greater than the difference between these two men, Espartero and O'DonnelL The one with a popularity which has not been seriously impaired among the masses of the people, who cannot bat reverence a political and personal probity that has never been called in question; the other generally disliked, and whose previous career his wamest partisans do not Wish. 4o have recalled. Espartero personifiex the revolution, and is unquestionably the chosen of the people, and had he' but- one-half the energy, even wvithbnt the disregard to -scruple,. posnissed by his coflearae, or his rival, he could-rule Spaiin at his wilL. The &nommoxsie of his temper and his -hesitating and irndecisive eharacter.render hima liable to be influenced by his more unscrupulous and overbearing compa.nion. The result is that on many occasions Espartero, still loved as he is by the people, finds himself absorbed by the man who, -but for him, would not tow - be - where he is, and in miatters of government' has- really littleinfluence. It would reqatire-a -great deal to make Espartero the object of p6pular dislike, but his rity is oftetriedto theutmost; it has not only himself to keep afloat, but is put to a severe test by-the additional and ungrateful burden of O'Donnell. Espartero keenly feels the sort of tutelage he is kept in, and he often winces. But his anXiety to shake off the yoke is not manifested in a very dignified manner.- The- strange -fact of some of the confidential friends of E.spartero and *his military household voting against the Government of which their chief is the head bas been witnessed more than once. This, occasional outbreak of impatience tends, of course, to embitter the feel-ing; and,ifitbe meant as a pretext against coercion, the manner in which it is-made is hardly-consistent with dignity or fairness.. Honest ind moderate as Espartero is in the. exercise of his power, such complete independence of suberdlinates cain hardly be attributed to indiffierence :or toleration.

SARDINLA (FROM: our OWN CORPXSPONDzTr.) TURIM, FE 7. A pamphlet published at Brussels and leipsic, under the title of La NationaliMT Italienne, has already obtained a g^Aod deal of notice here, andi probably will do so elsewhere in Europe wherever the Italian question is thlought worthy of attention| and its circullation is permnitted. In E:ngland, no doubt, both these conditions exist; but, as it may' not be immediately translated, it possibly has not yet appeared there in a popular form, or in 'one sufficiently so to attract'general attention. The author, who has thought proper to preserve an incognito, trats the question with impartiality and toleration. He certainly goes an fond of his subject, for he commences with a sketch of the Peninsula from 2600 B.C., and shows that since then it was only under the Roman Republic that a unity existed for Italy, and, owing to peculiar circumstances, only since' possible under the great Napoleon. Between Julius Ciesar' and Napoleon Bonaparte no man had appeared capable of uniting Italy; but Napoleon in assuming the French' crown forgot his Italian origin, or at. least sunk his patriotism in his desire to make France predominant, and the occasion was lost. 'Nevertheless, the writer thinks his reign, on the whole, was favoura'ble to the futuoe developmont':of Italian unity, inasmuch as it is impossible for, a man' of his iranscendent genius not to have left traces of his rule, which did,i fact, raise a new order of things from the ruins of the old. For 30 yearS and more after the fall of Napoleon Austria hadpursued Metternich's policy of repressing -Italian nationsality, and wAs aisto,nished in lS4Sto find it as vigorousas ever. The;cause of is ill-success, then,, is as well known ag its continued 'and undiiniinshed, existence is indisputable ;- and it is on this national feeling and the unity of religion and language that the writer founds his hopes of figure independence. feadvocatesthe separation of the temporal-fron the spiritual power' of the Pope, and giving the Holy Father the city of Rome, with a revenue guaranteed by all Catholic States; for, as he'says, the. Papacy has become so notoriously feeble as a temporal Power that-it is-a constant source, and must continte so, of 'foreign 'interveutfon. In fine, he concludes by expressing his confidence that men of 'all parties-Unionists -and Fed6ralists, Republicans and Monarchists-will defer their minor 'schemes to this onegrand object of national independence. The position which the Sardinian representative is to hold at the forthcoming conference has been' made the subject of some' comment by foreign journals, and is natiurally one of great interest here. It hlas been said that his position 'will be inferior to those of the representatives of the other belligerent Powers, which has given great satisfaction to the opponents of the VesterA alliance, as they can thereby ulpbraid its -sulpporters 'with having made, sacrifices of every kind without obtaining even the gratification of gaininD rank .by. courtesy for their country. "Now, I behieve that not- only the Court of -France.e has ekxpressed itself lately in terms of the warmest friendship towards this country, but the Government of St. Petersburg- has also intimated that it regarded without resentment-the conduct of Piedmont in the war. If these sentiments be sincere, there surely can be no difficulty in conceding to that open and nianly policy which has won the respect even of the enemy privileges which inert nations claimn byNirtLe of their size. x.

JOURTA-LISAT IN wxASHLKGTON. The following letter from Mr. Horace Greeley, headed "Border Ruffianism in Washington," is-extrmeted from the Eitbral correspondence of the New York 2W Innc- "Washington, Jan. 29. -!I have heard since I came here a gaood deal of the personal violence to which I was exposed, but only one man bas offered to attack me till to-day, and he -as so drunk that he made a poor fist of it. In fact, I do not remember that aiy marn ever seriouslyattacked me till now. I was conversing with two gentlemen on my wvy down from the capitol after the adjomrnment of tho House this afternoon, when a stranger requested a word with me. I stopped, and my friends went on. The stranger, who appeared in the prime of life, sia feet high, and who must weigh over two hundred, thus began "'Is your name GreeleyP? "'Are you a non-combatant ' That is according to circunmstances.' "The words were hardly out of my month when he struck me a stunning blow on the right side of my head, and, followed it by two or three more as rapidly as possible. My hands wera still in my greatcoat pockets, for I had no idea that he was aboutto strikeme. He staggered me against the fence of the walk from the capitol to the Avenue, but {Ed not get me down. I rallied as soon as possible, and .saw him standing several feet fnrm me, with several persons standing or rushing in betvween us. I asked,-' Who is this man s I don't know him-' and understood him to answer with an iiprecaSion,-' You'll know me soon enough,' or ' You'll know me hereafter,' when he turned and went down toward the street. No ons answered. my inquiry directly, but some friends soon came up, -who told me that my assailnt was Albert Rust, .s. C., from Arkansas. He gave no hint of any cause or pretext lie may have had for this assault, but I must infer that it is to be found in my strictures in Monday's biounc on his attempt to drive Mr.. Baniks ont of the field as a candidate for Speaker by passing a resolution inviting all the present candidates to withdraw. I thought that a meaa trick, and said. so moet decidedly. I certainly think no better of it, now that I have made the acquaintance of its author. " The bully turned and walked on. I followed, conversing with two friends. Crossing Four-and-a-Half. street, they dropped behind to speak to acquaintances, and I, waimng along toward the aational Hotel, son fonnd myself in the midst.of a huddle of strangers. One of these turned. short upon me-I sawv it was my former a;ssailant-and said, 'Do you know me nowP I answered, 'Yes;* you are Rust of Arkansas.' He said sornething of what he would do if I wrere a combatant, and I repliedt'nat I claimed no exemption on that accounmt. He now idrew a heavy cane, which I had not seen'efore, and strucka-pretty heavy blow at my head, which I caught on myleft arm, with no other damage than aathersevere bruse. Hovwa tr3-ng to strike again, and I w*as endeavouring to close with him, when several persons rushed b etween and separated us. I did not strike him at all, nor lay a zinger on him; hut it certainly would have been a pleasure to me had I been able to perform the public duty of <nocking him down. I cannot mistake the movement of his hand on the Avenue, and am sure itmust have been toward a pistol in his belt. And the crowd 'which surrounded us Was nearly aU Southern, as he doubtless knew before he renewed his attack on me. ",Now, it vwouid do to say that my stricures on Rust's proposition were harsh and provokin-, if his own friends had not spok-en. of it substantially as I did. But Mr. Mi Mullen, who is a violent Pro-Slavery Democrat, has repeatedly spoken of it in public and in private quite as severely as I did. He stigmatized it in the House to-day as insultingto Mr. Bans, and declared that he was anxious to beat Mr. Banks, but would not insult him. Mr. M'Muhlen tried.to speak of it in this- strainwshen he voted to lay it on the table, but the gag rule prevented. In fact, it is notorious here that Rulst's attempt to rule Mr. Banks to decline was defeated becauise the better portion of Mr. Banks's adversaries, though they sadly wanted to get him off the track, could. not stoop to this mode of doing it. Hear what Mr. M'Iullen said of it in the house to-day:- "'However much, Mr. Clerk, I condemn-as undoubtedly I do condemn, and as it seems to me every gentleman should condemn, the conduct of Mfr. Bans in holding on to his position as a candidate wvith unprecedented pertinacity, yet, Sir, it was not my province then, nor is it my province or my purpose now, to condemr that gentleman's course by a forsal vote. My rule, Sir, has been all my life never to take counsel from my enemies. Mr. Banks has a right to look upon the Demacratic party as his political enemies. We are such. T declare myself one of them; and I do not believe that it is in accordance with that courtesy that should characterize the conduct of gentlemen here for this side of the House to attempt to dictate to the other side of the House. That was the ground upon which I placed my vote in voting to lay that resolutionupon the table. I sought an opportunity to explain that vote at the time the questin was taken, but we wrere acting then wder that nefarious gag-law, aud I was prevented rrom doing so.' "'[This is the Glo's report, wrhich I am confident is far less strong than thelanguag^e actually usqed. hyMr. M'Muhlen. I have a clear recollection of hearing Mr. iM'Mullen say that w hile he wvas anxious to beat MIr. Bank;s he could not vote to insuilt him. " Iresume thhis not thelastoutrage to which I am to be sub1ectod. I came here with a clear understanding that it was about an even chance whether I should or should not be allowed to go home alive, for my business here is to unmask hypocrsy, defeat treachery, and rebuke meanness, -andthess aro not daityemployments,even insmoothertimes thau ours. But I shall stay here just solongasI thi kproper. msinggreat-plainnessof speech, but ende vourig to treat all men justly and faithfully. I may often judge hiarshly, ana. even bemistaken as to facts, hut!shllalways be ready to correct my mistakes and to amend. my judgments. I shall carry no weapons and engage in no brawls; but if ruffians waylay nd assailmeI shall certainly not run, and, so far as able, I shalldefend myself. "HE. G." r..j Rusfs STATEMN'T.

CITY COMMISSION OF SEWERS, GUILDHALL. SANITARV MA'TR 3fr. Daw, the chief clerk, drew the attention of the com. missioners to a communication from the sitting alderman in the justice-room respecting the condition of a house in Green Dragon-court, and read the report of Dr. Letheby, the raedical officer of healtb, from which the following is an "In accordanco with a request contained in a letter comanurdcated by Mr. Aldeinnan Lawrance to Afr. Daw, I have carefully inspected every house in Green Dragon-court, Smithfield, and I find that the cellars are all in a dirty condition-that the dust is rarely removed by the dustman. In sonice instances there are accumulations for a period of three months, and the water-butts in two or three cases are in an unsound condition. Your inspector, Mr. Ternouth, has already reported this fact to tho Court, and orders were issued as far back as thc 15th of January for certain iunprovements in these respects. I now beg to submita further list of imnprovemuents that are necessaryto the health and comfort of others of the poor who inhabit this court. In respect of the toom in No. 12, where the death took place to which reference has been made, I had not an opportunity of seeing it, as the key Mas in the possession of the parish authorities, and on in:ry among the neighbours, and even of the inmates of the house itself, I cannot learn that any one was at aU acquainted with the habits of the deceased, as she had not been out of her room for eome years, and her son, who lived with her, would not allow any one to have access to it; and your inspector, when he reported on the state of the court a month ago, was ignorant of the dirty habits of the deteased. "HENRY LETHEBY, .B." It was then ordered that the owners should be served with notices to amend the samne generally; and the scavenger was ordered to be sumnmoned to answer for the neglect so conspicuous and intolerable. THE CSy CERY. Mfr. ABRARAM called the attentiorn of the commissioners to some remarks which had been made in the House of CIommons on Monday night, and which seemed to call for exertion to get the City of London Cemetery opened with all possible expedition. He thought it neces-ary to say that be considered that a mist.ake had been made by some hon. members in supposig that the City Cemetery had been constructed for the relief of Hoxton or otherparishes not in the Citv. the CuAnsA-N (Deputy Peacock) said he hoped that many parishes out of the city would use the City of London emetery. If it had been anupposed by the committee that applications would not be made by the authorities of other parishes for the use of the ground, so extensive a burial-placee certainly would not hav-e been constructed. (Hrear, hear.) The accommodation would be found to be most unexception. able. 3fr. French, the chronometer maker in Cornhill, obtained leave to fix a ball at the top of his house for the purpose of communicating through the Electric Tlegraph Company's wires with Greenwich Observatory, and marking the true time thereby. nlE PEEL STATUE. Objedion having been made by 3r. ]Deputy Lott to the lamps behind the statue of Sir Rbert Peel m Cheapside, as calculated, from their position, to give encouragement to nuisances rather than to abate them in that vicinity, it vas explained that the lamps haa been so placed at the desire of Mr. Echnes, the sculptor. ILlIXATVZG PO R OP G. Dr. Ietheby handed in the following report:- " Gentlemen,-I have the honour to submit my report .of the inuminating power and chymical quality of the gas supplied by the Great Central Company to the city of LOu. *don during the last quarter.

MYTsRTIouos IURDzu fl STA'FORsDsHRE.-On Taesday an inquest was held at Swan village, near West Broinwich, South Staffordshire, on the body of a young man, named Robert Grnbbit, about 20 years of age, which was found in the canal on Saturday afternoon last. The throat was cut, and two large stones were in the pockets of the jacket, weighin- the one 71b. and the other 21b. The body was discoverca by an old man named ichard Evans, who wras endeavouring to rake bits of coal from the canal. He gave an alarm, and a policeman named Sharratt came to his assistance. They drewf the man'rs body out of the water, and perceived his throat had been cut, and that there was a cut atso over the left eye. He had nothing in his pockets but the atones above referred to, and a'.hoemaker's bill, by means of which his identity wastraced. Ayoungwoman named Harper stated that thc deceased had been her fellow-servant at 3ir. Beddard's, who resides at Dixon's-green, near Dudley, where he had been Eving for four yea On Thuasday, the 17th of January last, a friend of the deceased called npon him about noon, and at 2 o'olock the deceased went out ; and it was proved that from that hour until 5 'clock he was at a pblichouse ml the company of his friend, wvhere they tadtvopints o. ale together. At 5 o'dock he returned to Mr. Bedda(d's, when his fellow-servant said something to him about remaining out so long. He appeared offended, went out, and never retarned. It was stated that he slept at the house of a friend of Harpers on the Eriday night following, but there was no nnown of where he went subsequently. A wroman states that a few nights before the body was found she heard a great noise about the spot where it was discovered, and on looking out she -saw three or four men standing near the canal, and she heard wvhat she fancded was the report of a pistol, and one shouted "ShallUIshoottheb_ 7fr Mr. Kite, surgeon, of-West Brom,wich, hfad oade a oost fortem examnation of the body. He found a wound on the throat, five inche long, which had evidently beea inficted with a sharp instrument; and one on- the forehead, half an inch lon, of a simiLar character. He also discovered seS-ral external bruises on the skull, which mxast have been inflicted during life- with some blunt instrument. The lumgs and - heart contained only a little water; very little blood bad flowed from the wound in the throat, as the carotid artery had not been severed, and that wound could not have caused death. The blows - which had produced, the wounds on the bead would cause insensibility, and ~the W6ands on the throat had been either inDicted while the deceased Was insensible or after death. He was of opinion that the deceased was firstanned, and thrown into the Wati fter his throat had been cut. Had death been cauised by.drowning,there would have been more water in the lungs, and the heart would have been distended. He did not think the deceased could have himself inflicted tbe woauds on the throat. Two attempts had evidently been made, ind the cut on the forehead was probably made at the same tnne, by the person who inflictedathe wounds en tbethroat. The body colLld not have been in tho water more ihan a-few days. The inquest was adjourned, to enable the police au-thorities to make further inMuh eE- nchwsfem- Ezaminei.

' ; (Before tlcetonn JUS15fcyS of APPEAL.. EX PARTE BATLHAX, 12 RE ROUTLEDGfEi This was an appeAl presente by Mfr. Bateman, a tiaber .merchant, against a decision of MIr. Commissioner(oulburn, refusing to permit the proof of n debt caimed by him against the estate of Messrs.' IEutledge, sawmill proprietore, for i the sum of 2,3604, 4&d, teh ' lleged vailue Of certain tirnbei delivered by himito them for the purose of *being sawn, and which, .bef6re the Messrs. Leuledge became bankrupt, was destroyed by fire. The case was argted on the 25th ult., and the facs a to bD that MIr. Bateman, ier Ast,. 1S53, agree with Messr. Routledge to send timber to their mills for the' purpose of being sawn, and they agreed to hold all tinber so sent, 'and for the tine being in their custody insured from loss or damage by fire, and to pay to Mr. Bateman the value of all or so much of tho timber as should be burnt. Timber was sent to the nills early in 1855, and on the 16th of February in that year the same was destroVed by fire. On the 17th of May Mr. Baternan brought an action for the value, and on the 31st of that month the Messrs. Routledge were adjudicated bankrupt. Notwvithstanding this, the action went on, the trial took place, and onthe 10th of July a verdict was returned for the pLaintiff for 15360Z. 4s. 8d. On the 10th of September judgment was signed, but no execution was issued. Mr. Bateman apliecd to the commissioner for leave to prove against the bankrupts' estate for the before-mentioned sum, but the ap*lication was refused for two reasons-first, that the -claim against the estate was merged in the amount recovered in the action; and, secondly, that the amount of claim had not been ascertained and could not be ascertained. From this rejection of proof Mr. Bateman appealed. Mr. Bacon and 'Mr. Selwyn appeared for the appellant; Mr. Swanston and Mr. Bagley were counsel for the assignees in support of the decision of the commissioner. Mr. SELwy.wx was heard in reply. Their Lordships delivered judgment thismorning. Lord Justice .sHonT BRUCE said that the order this Court had agreed to make might at first sight appear to exhibit dissent from the course taken by the learned commissiones'. but his Lordship desired, as faras he was concerned, not to be so understood, for it was probable that, on the authorities and with the evidence which were before the commissioner, he (thc Lord Justice) would have acted as that learned gentlemasi had acted-that is, he should have declned to admit the proof until the case had been brought before the Lord Chancellor or the Lords Justices. Tha single question turned upon the contract between the parties, through the entire terms of which it was not neces. sary to go ; but the cidence satisfied him that the bhan1crnts did intend tobind themselves, and did bind themselves to n- sure the timber against fire, or loss or damage by fire, while it was on their premises-that is, that for valuable consideration they agreed to makc good to the petitioner any loss or damago by fire to the amount of the value of the timber, though whether for moneyexceeding the value of the timber at the time of delivcryg might be doubtful. A fire did occur, and the timber was destroyed before the bankruptcy, and on that event the bankrupts became immediately accountable for the value of the timber, limited, perhaps, to any right of set-off; but as to what was the value his Lordship had not made up his mind. The matter nmust go back to the com. nissioner. Lord Justice TunRsR was of the samie opinion, and thought that the two points reEed upon by the respondents were,thatthecontraetwasonly toinsurethetimber, forbreach of which the bankrupts were only answerable in dasnages; and, secondly, that if the value of the timber was the nseasure of dam age the value was so uncertain it could not be admitted ; the proof could not be sustaicd. The contract was, upon the evidence, to make good the value of the timber, and the lossmust bethemeasureof proof. The case must go back to the commissioner. It was ultimately decLaredthat the petitioner w s entitled to prove for the value of the timber at the time of the fire, he consenting that such value should not be more than its value at the time of its delivery at the mills, without prejudice to any question of set-off and mutual credit. No execution to issue in the action, and the petitioner to enter up satisfaction of the judgment. LUmBOCK V. MUR?HY.

VICE-CR CELoRS' COUIRTS. P?£m i-. (Before vT.cCheanahlJt "- . STTA E) No case of general interest came before t-iJ.urs i. (Bcfore Vicc-Ohancdlor Sir W. P. WOOD.) CRAWFORD AND OTHERS V. THE NORTH-EASTERN RAIL- WVAY COMPANY AND OTnHRS. The plainttl; in this case are preference sharebolders in theLeedsca italstockof the above company, which was incozporatedby anactof Parliament passed in 1854. By that act the Leeds Northern Railway Company and the York and North Mlidland Railway Company were dissolved, and those undertakings became vested m the York, Newcastle, and Berwick Company, which was incorporated by the name of the North-Eastern Railway Company ; but the provisions of the acts relating to the dissoh-ed companies and all obligations attaching to them were declared to be of fall force upon and in relation to the new company. The object of the present suit was to obtain from theCourtadeclaration that the net balance w.hich at the end of each half-year is applicable to the payment of dividend on the " Leeds capital stock" (being that portion of the whole capital of the North-Eastern Company which formerly represented the capital of the Leeds Northern) ought to be appliei first in payment of the dividend then accring due, and the unpaid arrears of former dividends on the firstpreference shares, and then in payment of the accruing dividendand unpaid arrears of former dividends on the second, third, and fourth preference shares sucoessively, according to their priorities, and before any dividend is paid to the ordinary shareholders. The defendants to the suit were the directors of the company and some of the ordinary shareholders. The shares in respect of which the plaintiffs claimed were second preference shares, classes numbers 1 and3,andfourth preference shares, but the holders of other preference shares were not made parties to thebill,whichallegedgenerally that the holders of preference shares were very numerous, and that the interests of all of them were sufficiently represented in the suit. The claim of the plaintiffs was rested on the construction of several acts of Parliament, resolutions, agreements, and reports, set oat or referred to in the bill, and upn thetgreat trregularity which had forsome time past been prevalenlt in the payment of the dividends on the p reference shares; and upeon an allegation that there was a large balance in the hands of the directors, a,pplicable to the payment to p reference shareholders, according to their priorities, hut whlich balance the directors intended to die- tribate among the ordinary holders of the Leeds capital stock. The case was sgued by Mr. Rolt and Mr. Erskine for the plaintiffs; Mr. xv. James and Mr. Hobhouse for the directors; and Mr. Greene for the ordinary shareholders. The VICe-CHANCELLOR, on coming into court this emarn ing, said that he should not call on Mr. Rolt for a reply ; and, after commenting on the various acts of Parliainent, &c., made a decree in favour of the plaintiffs in the terms of the prayer as above given, with anaddition that such decree was to be without prejudice to any application which might be made on behalf of any preference shareholders in respect of their priorities as between themselves.
VOTTRWP (b1 1Y(¶1VATI~fM~ WVn IQ, DINSD,UE V. 3MUGGERIDGE AND OTMXRS. {SfUingsatirPrius, b~efore 'thc cTrIEw B1doN, at Ouf1d1zaJL ~ ~ ~ a Mr. Zer3eant Shee and Mr. Holl were counsel for the taintiff; Mr. 3L Chambers, Mr. Edwin James, Mr. Cook t tvans, d Mr. Quain appeared for the several defendants. The plaintiff lately carried on business in Oxford-street as a saddler, and this was an action against the sberifls of M3iddlese.x, their officers, and 3Mr. osortimer, the landlord of the plaintif;, and Mr. Bird, the attorney of that gentleman, in which the plaintiff claimed damages for certain trespasses conimitted on his house on the 23dof May, 18M, and for the wrongful seizure and detention of his goods and chattels from that day until the present time. It appears that the plaintiff held the premises in question at a rent of 2221., paying qudrterly. under a, lease for 14 years, commencing ln 187, and thatthere ias a power of re-entry in the event of 'the rent remaining due and unpaid 80 days. The rent was paid regularly up to l8u, buf on the 23d of Ma, 1855,' there were two:quarteri' rent due, the last quarter being then 29 days in arrear. Before that day Mr. Vinsdale had sold off his 'sfock and furniture, and had put a. policeman and his family into the house to take care ofit, and the shoep fitur6s-and the few' remin. ing goods, and to refer inquiries to his agent, Mr. Gibbons. On the 23d of May the sheriffs took3 possession of the house udera writ of lzauerefcias po&v&ione7n, issued in an action of ejectment at the suit of Mr. Mortimaer. In this suit, however, there'had been a fatal exror, inasmuch as the proceedings had been servedon the polceman, treating him as the tenant in possession, on whom such service ought to have been effected. In consequence of this irregularity the present action was brought, but the parties being conscious of their error applied to the Court, and a judge's order was made on the 29th of May, under which the prefnises welo given up to the plaintiff, while he was limited in the further prosecution of his action to such damages. is he could show to have been sustained for any wrongs or inijuries inflicted by the defendants after May 29. It now appeared that on the 24th of May the sheri;fs' officer turned certain property of the plaintiff oxt of this house into the street, and that thereupon thepoliceman, by the advice of the paintiffs agent, tookthe Propertyin a van to a sale-room. What became of it after that diy did not Clearly appear, but at the close of the plaintiff's case, His LoBDSsnIp stated it to be his opinion that there was Do evidence to fix either the sheriffs their officers, or the other defendants wihay*r or detention of _tie plintian 's'roperty after 'the ' tf'MA.

' ' ;- This was an action to recover compensation for thebreach of a contract for the convevance of the plaintiff anh 1s wife to London from Sainaica, by the sailing.ship Comnmodore, the property of thedefendant. Thepliintiff-was'in theservice of the Customs at Jamaiea, and, being desirous of returning to England, engaged with the, captain of the Coinnodore for a passage for himself and his wife for the sum of 401., to include board and extras; the vessel being advertisidto sail' "in all August." At the same time the plaintiffpaid dovn 37l., and the captain said ho expected to sa' about the 10th, but that, being not quite loaded, he intended' to take the ship rouud from Klingston to the Black River tofill up, and that, when prepared to sil, he would give three day notice The plaintiffl relying on this conttact,'sold I all his goods and went into lodgings, xpecting to- be sum'- moned daily. He, however, received no notice from the captain, and did not hear of his movements till the 3d' of October, when he learntthat the Coinmodordhadsailed for England. Upon this the plaintiff took a p&ssage to Southampton in the steamship Atrato, at a Cost of 641. lOs.; and for this and other incidentd items 'uf outlay, amounting to 1001. mnd upwards, the ' plaintiff on his arrival made a claim, upon the defendiat-as the owner of the Commodore. The defendaut,' however, repudiated the contract' as being a matter- entirely for the captain, and 'not with himself as the owner, btat ideferred the further consideration of tho clainitill the arrival of the captain. When the captain did arrive he *aited on the plaintiff, and, excusiog his desertion 'of -'ii on the score of bad weather offered to return his deposit - 'but tho plaintiff hadh1y that, time commenced this action, and he refused to accept the offer. On the part of the defendant it was now contended that, as the Commodore was a trader and not a passenger ship, the owner was :not liable for the conduct and contracts of the captain in this matter, who had the power to take passengers on his owns account The captain and the defendant proved that in the 'West India trade the passage moneo was exclusively the concern of the former, but that the ltter received 20 per cent. of it as compensation for the use of the ship's stores 'during the vhe hb.- BArtoN then expressed a strong opinion that, under tho circumtsances, there was no evidence aga'nst the defendant, and directed a nonsuit.

ARCHIER COURT. WlP.nnvnAY- 77vg 1.2 (Before Sir J. DODSON. I This was a suit promoted by Mr. William Y. IHunt, of Bell Broughton, in the county of Worcester, against his wifo to obtain a divorce by reason of her alleged adultery. In the libel given in on his behalf it was pleadedt that the Earties ;ercemarriedonthe2d of Jan=av, 1S, and cohabited togetler at Bellevue, in the paish of Hales Owen, Worcestershire; but in 1851, at the instance of Mrs. Hunt, who said that the place disagreed with her, they went to reside at Henwick. In June, 1852, Mr. Hunt took a house called the Yew Tree, in the parish of Bell Broughton, where theycontinuedtolivetoretheruntiltheir final separation. Mr. Hunt, having steelwvorSs near Birmngnham, w,as frequently absent from his severalhomes. In July, 1850, he was introduced casuallyrtoutheHon. MauricneBerkeley Portliainy his tutor, the Rev. Mr. Bowilby, an acquintance of er. Hunt -1r. Portman being at such time of the age of 17 onl. From that time Mr. Portman was a frequent visitor of atnd H cunt at his several houses. The libel then went onto plead that Mr. Portman had committed adultery wuih -Ire. munt. The witht offence charged was in thec ummer of 1852, and variout specific instances were set forth in which it was alleged it had been repeated. On the 1Gth of February, 185l , Mr. Portman, though neither expected nor invited by Mr. Hunt, came to his house, it was sai, and represented, in order to account for his visit, that had got into a serape with the police at Durham, whe he sai, wero after him. He remained thero until the 19th of that month, and on the 24th it came to the knowledge of Ir. Hunt that his wife, instead of having despatched one of their ser ants on a different errand, as she had pretended, to aecoent for his absence, had reacly sent him clandestinely with a letter to Mr. Portinano He thereupont e- monstrated with her, and slab expressed his disapprobation *of her too great, apparent intimacy with Mr., Portman, although neither knowing nor suspecting at such time any ariminal ntercourse b etween- them. In the correc of an altercation which then ensued Mrs. Hunt, although vehemently protesting her innocence, avowved that. Mr.Ptortman and herself were in love with one another, amnd she then for the first time endeavoured to -make out .that the tempers, habits, and pursuits of herself andsher hshand were wholly inconpatible, and urged upon hin the propriety or ex;pediency of their living, fora timeat least, separate and apart from each other, to which hedat last gave way and consentehd tad she was placed uder the protection of her mother. Intediately on their separation he nade a suitable provision for her maintenince. He was afterwvards induced by runtmoirs in the neighbourhood as to the general improprmaty oF her conduct with reFerence to mt. Postman to place the matter in the hands of his' solcitor for investigat and it as oly in theresult of such investigation that he became aware for the first time of her commission of adultery with himi. He then brought an action against Mr. Postman to ,which he pleaded, "Not guilty," but at the trial wvhich took P lace on the 24th of June, 1854t the Jury assessed the damages 'at 501., excclusive of costs. Inn r eSpOnSiVe alleption given in by Mrs Hent it was alleged that the imrage had never been consulmmated, and that Mfr. Hunt had so admitted in February, 1853; that he allowed her to keep 3p an epistolary correspondence with 31r. Portman, and constantly and habitually encouraged their intimacy; that be frequently invited and pressed Mr. Portman to his house, and left himn alone with hner UJpon several occasions he said to her, " You can take Postman for a drive with you if yout like," and never cautioned her against their intimacy, er complained thereof to any of her family. Many of the rumous referred to in the libel had been for a lena timen befre the separation well known to and disregarded by him. In October, 1852, Mrs. Hunt was tay on a visit with the Rev. Mr. Lea, and on Mr. wit coming over Mr. Lea told him of remarks which were made as to Mrs. Hunt so often'driving out with M3r. Portman, to which he at once replied that he had solcen t0 MA:. Hunt, and told her that if they wanted to dnrve out 'thez should do it in the country or in the lanes, and iot -ui atd do-wn Wor. cester. On the 14th of February,. 18,3, a lidy who 'was staying in their house on a visit inquired of him whether he did not observe that his -wife was m love with Mr. Portman, to which he replied, " How can you-vsaj so ?" and on the samne occasion said to her, "' Oh, let them go on, and I will get a divorce." On the folowlagdaythelev. Mr. Sedgwick -wrote to Mr. Lea, requestng him to comne over to the Yew Tree and consult' with himn on what ineans could be taken to break off the evident intimacy subsisting between Mrs: Htunt and Mr. Portman. They had a long interview, and by their joint persnasions Mr. Portmian was induced, to leave the house. on the 17th of February. During the 'whble of such interview, which lasted i2ntil between 2and 3 oclock in the miorning, Mx. Hunt reznained in the billitid-room Without taking any notice of their proceedings. Tle plea then went on to recriminate, and to chargeMr. untwith having conmitted a series of actsof adulteryextending fromthe year 1847 down to the period of the tion. It-con cluded by alleging that no evidence was taken in the acton brought by MiEr. flnt against Mr. Portman; that the verdict was for 501. nominal danages * that Mr. 'Portman -was at the time in South America, ana wholly unaware 'of the verdict havingbecn consentedto. - Dr. AI3DA.Is (with whom was 2Dr. Crteis) appeared oi behalf of Mr. Hunt, and said that he did not mean to conw-. tend that the case set p against him was not suficiently proved, but he should Lke to know'wh-ther , twa intended to be argued that the idultery of Mrs. Hunt *as not established?

TheCourtthentooktimeto comsiderwsether the case couldI bo allowved to proceed.I His HoNoutm now delive&ed judgment.' lie seid this was the case of a person -who, ona his on -motion, s6ught the beniefit whuch:the bankrupt law gavie to traders, btit' it was perfectly plain that this advantage as never intendod to be conferred upon mnerely nomia traders. Thbe banrPt in this case had cariedc on business under the ver' general. term of accoun,tant. He did niot mean to say tnything disrespectful of that class of persona ; for anlor; them were to be found very many inen of the bighest ittainments and prbity,. and who wiere mnoat useful in mnatters of account. But it was ampossible to sit in that court withiotut seeing that the name was adopted by a' very different clas of persons; everybody almost eaDed himself an accountantand. there was nothIngto preventt his doing so. These persons, as they dealt with men who were in difficulties, -rdre in the habit of assisting them, not 'only by making u,ptheir accounts, hut Lyv procuring tlhem loans. To perssin difficulties this was always aceptable. They were'-.irays glad tobe kept afloateanttle longrD. The accountant!took his ill, and then got money uapon it when and bowhe could. Sometimes he advertised, as this man bad done, anlnouncng in grandiloquent terms; worthy o~ George Robiiis, '1 Noblemen and gentlemen are informed that by aliplying to Mr. Simmons they can obtitn advances of money 'pn their bills~" It was adnmitted 'here that the banifrupt had not monbe of his own to disc6unt he hinLS thnt heagot themn discounted somehow or othereat r- fcos auy They Then came the questior whether such a man could be airly caled a hillbroker. Hadl the questionx come before huni on the opening of the petition, he should certainy hard hldci that wit was not so, though the point was one on which he should wish to have the opinion of the highest authority In this case the petition bad been opened in the absence of the Commissioner through ilhiessa , by eou e of the shortlgrbe very ab oand competentpgrson, no doubt, butasill headjudican ablea to MB trnacin hsabi-roe tion bad talen place in the abasence of the Commtissioner, whose busins it was to consider and adjudirateh -pon i.

He sid he consdered JaVal's oonduct ,pregnant with spicion, ad in dischsrga the aceused parties he said, " This nest of swindlers wast be let loose upn society with impunity." Sir W.M AxNY said,lews edyto hsar any explana. tion Mr. Jval. to o Ter reative to the case detailed above. , Mr. Montogte 1verason (solicitor to 'Mr. Java!) Said,Some time ago a mSnk named Dacis D'Alengon was introduced to Xr. ,Javs], by highly respectable people, as a poltical refugee. He Wa - man of preposessing appeance and most engig manners; hut at turned out that, instead of beinga political refugee, ho was a fugitive from justice. Slorti after his aoquaintance with Mr. Javal nerepreeented to that gentleman that he was going to Ireland, and had entered itnto partnership with a Mr. Duncan, of Dublin. PNot long afterwards this DaCs DYAlen. orof Barab, or a hundred other ,aliu that he used wgo by, ralted npon hr. Javal on his way.to the continent, anoeveam he elieitordrrs for somne gOoo& lying at a o he hxtquested ti w take care of for him. He kept thejrders for about a fortnight, and thensent acart forthe goods, whentheporterinfomned3ijm they werestopped. Ile immediately wrote to know why they were stopped, and the next he heard about it was that he was giv into cudsody. He (lIr. Loverson) instracted Mr. Lewisa to defend JavaI-a core Tery common in the legal prefession where one solicitor is better aceuainted wtih a particular practice than another-who admitted the letter written by Javal, although there was no evidence of the fact-Wefore the Court, aidhe did not ask for the immediate diEcharge of his client because he lnew that Mr. Javal courted inquiry to clear his own reputtation. Between the first and mcond hearinz th solicitor for the prosecution mado every nqmury, and became convinced that there was not the slightest ground for such a charge, and the result was that he made all the axnende honorable in his power, becausohe found there wasnotthe slightest evideuceagainst Mr. Javal. The prosecutor withdrew from the other chare, in consequence of not being able to get certain letters from the French anthorities. What his client h.ad to complain of was, that the alderman made use of thc expressions that "the conduct of JaviLl was tainted with suspicion," and next " that this gang of swindlers was to be let loose upase society." The fact of Javal writing the letter after the goods were sgtopped proved himn to be an hcnest man, and, therefore, if the magistrate stil held the same opinion, he wras anious to be examined en oath, in order to remove that impression, and for the purpose of clearing his characterin the eyes of tho public. Sir W. NMAGAY sid, he did not exactly understand what Mr. Javal had to complin of, for when the case was dismissed his solicitor said "Hr. Javal leaves this court without a stain upon his character," and he (Sir W. *agnay) said, "Mr. Javal is discharged from his rececuizanes i ith re;ard to the other prisoner, who was n businessWnGreat Winchester-street and other places, ho said that the urosecutor bad tampered with the prisoner hom t;hey haa caught by promising not to prosecute him if hewould divalgeallhnewv;but that remark did not apply to Javal, as oe was notin custody, but uponhis recognizances. Mr. Leverson Mid that that remark, in conjunction with what had been said before, applied to Javal Sr-W. MAGAy aslked what it was that Javal wished todo? Mfr. Leverson aid that his worship's remark was that Javal's conduct wr,as tainted with suspicion, and he 'wanted that stigma to be removed. Sir W. MAGNAY said, he knew that at the time it dia appear to hin very guspicious in the absence of all explanation. He ought to have made his statement then. Mr. Martin, the chief clerl, reminded Mr. Leverson that Mr.Java!hadnot given any explanation at that time, and that he was defended by Mr. Lewis, who defended the other prisoner also. 1fr. Leverson said, Javal was never asked any question, andhadnoopportunityof giv any explanation. Asregarded Mr. is defending Javal, that was his (Mr. Leverson's) act, but he did not know at that time that he was also retained for the other prisoner, cr, high as his opinion was of Mr. Lewis's abilitie4 that circumstance alone would have been suficent to deter him from engaging the services of that gentleman. Sir W. MAGNAlY said, there had heen a combination of aesared thafhe had no knowledgeeof the manner in which those goods-had got into the possession of Barrabl. When he found thata person was buying goods of every description all over the country in different names, and a portion of them were found in the possession of Javal without the explanation haa bd given, it was certainly suspicious. Mr. Ieverson said, beneverhad the opportunity of giving an explanation. r. Java, in answer to the alderman, said that BarraM6, or D'Aleucon, told himn there were some v ines in the cases, whichhe miight sell, and takeoa commission forbhis trouble; orhevwas to keep them in his yard until he sentfor them. Sir W. MUAGNAY remarked that thii kind of business was not in accordance with the business of an optician, but if he had then stated that he took them to oblige a friend, the case -would have worn a very different aspect Mr. Leverson said, Mr. Javal had been always ready to give that explanation, and he row desired to make that statement on oath. Sir W. MArsAY sAid, there was no occasion for him to make any deposition on oath. The statement that he had made would, no doubt, go forth to the public; and would set him right with them. The parties then withdrew. Bow-s rarT.-A smart-looking young man, named Cornelius William John Harvey, a clerk in the circulation department at the General Post-office, was charged with stealing several money-letters. The prisoner, upon whom usxpicioi had for Some time rested, was ultimately detected by the usual test' A letter containing two half-sovereigns, a sixpenny piece, and six stamps, all of which had been marked, was posted by fr. Sculthorpe, the Deputy Controller, and traced to that stage in itsprogress when it would in due course pass through the prisoner's hands, where, as was expected, it disappeared. The marked coins and sta.mps were found in the prisoner's private drawer, and he sdmitted to Mr. Sculthorpc that he hadburntthe letter. In his pocket and at his lodgings were found several other letters, containing each a sixpoence or a shiliing, and one of these, though purloined from the Postoffiice on Tnesday of last week,~ had not yet been opened. It contained a reitance of o^d. from a poor seamstreSs in London to her still poorer mother, at ea.nark-et, Suffolk.

MIARLBOROUG- .-An application w5s made to Mr. HADUwIcx a fer days ago by a woman of rerpectable appearance, who said she was companion and servant to the Princess Galitzin,taussian princess, and re d advice in the following matter:-Trhe princess, who dbeen about six months in England, hadbeen disappointed of iemittances from her husband, and, having run into debt at berlodginus in Green-street, the landlord had put in a distress for Lthe rent, and not only seized the personal property of the princess and a quantity of politicali papwers and documents of importance, bDut had also seized her (appiicant's) stock of wearingR appareL. She 'wished to know whiether the nmagisthate coulid assist her to sget back her wardrobe, or, what was of much more importance, the papers of the princess? Mr. 1tAnxwscK did not see what helphe coud afford in the matter. The princess had incurred a debt, and the landlord had a right to take legal proceedings for its r- covery. % e thought that the safest way wonldle to apply to the family of the Galitzins, who were among the wealthiest in Russia. The applicant said, Prince Alexander Galitain, w'ho was. a general in the Russian service, had suddenly ceased his remittances for nLo kcnow n reason, and the princess was atpresent labonrin3g nder such bodiiy infirmitythat she wa totalliy unable to proceed to Eussia. Mr. HIARDwicK said, one of the constables attached to the court should see the landlord, and tryto prevail upon him to give up what she required. Police-constableEawards was intrustedwith this rission, and, having executed it, he communicated to the magistratethe result.- He had seen the landlord, a medical entinan, and was toid by him that, acting nnder c advice of his solicitor, he would give up nothing, and:e was further con-finmed iDL this determination-by the refusal of the applicnt to open her boxes, to show ht she had no property of the princesss in them. Mr. HL R'DWtCa. then intim ted that ho could not interfere further in the matter. - . It s bsequently traspired that the prinocss hid been arrested and lodged in the house of a shers ofier in Chancery-lane. Mrs Lu3mley has sent SL.for the poorbox, e,

The collision took place on Sunday at midnight, off the Nore, on the voyage of the Trader from Portsmouth, with arms, carronades, shot, and Govermment stores. It appears that a thick fog pre. vailed at the time of the accident so as to prevent the lights from being perceived by the look-out, and also that no blame has been attached to any one, as no necessary precaution was neglected. Both vessels have sustained -considerable damage, the Trader having searboard bow knocked away, jibboom broken, bowsprit sprung, and larboard bow damaged. The steamer's mizenmast was knocked over; she had a boat bilged, and several of her stanchions carried away. Notwithstanding her damaged condition the Magnet lay to for some time, to render whatever assistance the Trader might require. The schooner Zebra is embarking a number of 68 and 32 pounderguns, gun-carriages, andammunitionfrom Woolwich arsenal, for Her Majesty's ships Trusty, Sappho, and Mohawk, at Chatham.

IVa=1, Assistant-Paymaster in charge, to the Rhadamanthus. Anaugmentation of the Royal Artillery having been decided on, by the addition of two extra battalions, several promotions wvil in consequence take place from the ranks of that regiment. The average number of volunteers and recruits now joining that corps exceeds 300 per week. The Artillery batteries are frequently brigaded in heavy marching order in the Arsenal marshes at Woolwich, as well as the Horse Artillery, wheneverthe weather permits. They likewise go through sundry rounds of practice with rockets, so that by the spring there is no doubt the Royal Artillery Regiment will form one of the most efficient corps in Her Majesty's service, and will then be more than 26,000 strong. Assistant-SUrgeon Wright, of the 20th Foot, is appointed to take medical charge of the depot of the 91st Reginment at Chatham, and Acting Assistant-Surgeon Grant, 70th Foot, is relieved from duty at the Garrison Hospital at Chatham, for the purpose of embark!ng for India to join his corps at Ferozepore.

When the Coldstreams arrived at the terminus the band struck up " Over the Hills and Far Away ;" and when they reached the platform " Cheer Boys, Cheer," was performed, the soldiers joining in chorns. The spectators loudly and enthusiastically cheered the troops until the train was out of sight. The Scots Fusileers numbered 224 rank and file, and the Coldstreams 270 rank and file. THE MlITIAI The depot of the King's Own Staffordshire Regiment of MElitia remains at Lichfield. Out of the small numoer at Lichfield 19 men have just volunteered into the Line, 17 have gone into the 80th Regiment, and two into the Grenadier Guards.

IRELAND. THE IRISH JUDICIAL BENC1. I (FRtOM Am= :Cn DITTRT.TV WFn-c^ 'Kor- -- The ±reniwg Post has the following remarks, apropos to the motion of Sir J. Shelley in reference to the state of the Irish judicial bench. Referring to the case of the venerable Baron Pennefather, whose great mental faculties are as unimpaired and vigorous as they were a quarter of a century ago, the Post maintains that his defective vision-especially as regards the trial of criminal cases-is a disqualification so positive that it cannot be got over :- "As an illustrative case, we may refer to a remarkable circumstance on the trial of Kirwun for the murder of his wife at Ireland's-eye. T'he jury, after they had been some time in deliberation, returned into court and sought an explanation of a passage in the evidence. 2r. Justice Crampton, one of the presiding judges, told them he had left his notes at home, but, as he had a perfect recoUection of the matter, he would state it from memory. And the learned judge did so. The memorial on behalf of Kirwan referred t.o this proceeding on the part of the judge, which was strongly objected to, on the grod that noes were not actuaUy produced, and the irregularity was relied upon as the chief point in favour of the crimiinal, whose sentence subsequently was commuted from death to transportation for life. It is clear that Baron Pennefather, from the loss of sight, could take no notes in a criminal or any other case, and, as such a duty could not be delegated, blindness necessarily involves complete disqualification for the discharge of judicial fLnctions no matter how clear and vigorous may be the faculties in other respects. It is a singular coincidence that the two oldest judges in. Ireland or any other part of the globe, Baron Pennefather and. lfr. Justice Torrens, are to be the judges of assize at the, aprachmg North-West Circuitthe sformer being in his 85th and the latter in his 84th year. Chief Justice lefroy is the junior of both, being inliis 82d year. .Mr. Justice Cramnpton is younger, hut only bya very few years, as he was, we believe, a Fellow of Trinity College when the foundation-stone of NelI son's Pillar was laid, and the Bank of Ireland was opened in College-green. We need scarcely say that we have no desire to utter a word reflecting in the least degree on any one of those learned judges. Some time since, as we have already mentioned, when strictures of the same kind were uttered by a portion of the press, we deprecated such conduct, urging that functionaries like Baron Pennefather, who had spent a long life most usefully in the public service, were entitled to forbearance, evens when they somewhat exceeded all reasonable limits in their accustomed vocation. We cannot, however, help admitting that, since we addressed that remonstrance to our contemporaries, time has been runnin his course, and we are no longer in a position to assert that men who have exceeded by 20 years the grand climacteric are competent to discharge the onerous, delicate, and deeply response le duties of judges, not alone afrecting the property, but the liberties and the lives of the Qucen's subjects."

THE LORUS DAY OBSERVANCE MOVEMXET. DEPUTATION TO LORD PALMERSTON. ihe interview on Isaturday between the First Minister of the Crown and a deputation of ministers and hagmen of a7l Evangelical 'denommations, headed by the Aichbishop of anterbury, was an occasion of extraodinaryinterest. Between 100 and 160) gentlemen assembled r.t his Lordship's residence, 144, Piccadilly. The attendanice would have been even more numerous bad not the invitations been reserieted, in deference, aswounderstand, to the Archbishop's wish that the number should be limited. Among those present were the Earl of Shaftesbury, Lord Dungarvan, the Hon. A. Kinnmrd, LP., Hi ht Hon. Joseph Napier MLard Mr. T. B.

Religious Tract Society, Sunday School Union, Sunday School Institute, Ragged School Union, Church of England Young Men's Society, YoungMen's Christian Association, Evangelical Alliance, Protestant Alliance, Protestant Association, Open Air Mission, Pure Literature Society, Lord's Day Society, Metrotpoeitaen Lord's Day Commnittee, Wesleyan Sabbath Committee, and other missionary and religious institutions. Lood Pablerston entered the room shortly after 11 o'clock. The Archbishop of CAHisGraceY, theking with evideflt emoson, brefy addressed his Lordship on the character of the question at issue, urgoin the close counexion betwveen our national Sabbath and the public maintenance of religion in the land, and pointing out the unanimity of all Christian bodies in upholdmng the present leeal sanctions of the Lord's Day. His Grace then i'iad the following. address: " We who have now the honour to address your Lordship are persuaded that we represent the common belief of the Christian people of this country that the observance of the Lord's Day is of Dvine authority and perpetual obligation. "We rejoice that this authority an oh gation have been acknowledged with more or less of Scriptural enlightennient at almost every period of our history; and we are thankful to God for the reverential recognition of that, His ordinance, by our Sovereign and her Government. " We have, therefore, heard with concern that attempts are being made, both in and out of Parliament, to break in upon its sanctity, and that, among other things, it is proposed to open such places as the British Museum and Crystal Palace, and otherwise to provide similar amusements for a portion of the people ou that day. " We are aware that the observance of the Lord's Day by the people comes far short of what it ought to be, yet at present all violations of its sanctityare opposed to the spi rit if not to theletter, of ourlaws; andit cannot be disputed that this nation has long been distinguished above many others by its outward and reverential observance of the entire day; and it is well understood by the people that the afternoon is not less sacred than the early part of it, and that secular occupations, studies, and recreations which are innocent, or even duties, on the other days of the week, are not suitable for the Lord's Day. We would carnestly oppose any attempt to diminish that public reverence for the day ; we cannot doubt that a departure from its due observance in any one particular would, if not resisted, soon lead to others; and, so far from it being reasonable to expect, as some persons do, that the proposed changes would have the effect of closing publichouses and haunts of vice on that day, it is more reasonable to expect that the valuable examnle hitherto set by this country would no longer be maintained with regard to public exhibitions generaly. "We cannot, as Christians or patriots, contemplate the present amount of SabbathbreakNgin the land without deep sorrow; and we w-ould strongly protest against adding the servants employed in museums, the Crystal Palace, and other places of amusement, to the numbers already engaged in secular business on the day which we are commanded to keep holy. "The afternoon and evening are the chief opportunities that many have of attending public worship, and the proposed innovations would add new allurements and obstacles to interfere therewith, and to tempt the young from seeking the instruction which they can oul receiv . at R {1DF caL olo J o ,d ;t in imp>os1ibie to ca1cu1ate the amount of the evils vhich must certainly arise if a human standard for the observance of the day of rest be allowved to take the place inthe minds of the people of the Divine will as it is revealedu InHoly Scripture, to which they have hitherto been accustomed to bow. " While we thank your Lordship for the opposition which you offered on a former occasion to a proposal similar to that whichwe now deprecate, We would entreat you not to give your assent or countenance to any motion tending to open the museums, Crystal Palace, and otier places of worldly amusement on any part of the Lord's Day, or calculated in any other way to disturb the due observance thereof, but rather to endeavour to relieve the numerous classes already engaged in various departments of labour and to lead the people towards a due observance of the ordinance and commnanment of Almighty God." Lord PAN\IEBSTON, in receivsng the address from the hands of the Archbishop, briefly responded to the feelings of the deputation. He acknowledged the importance of the question, and would give it every due attention. In a imatter involving Parliamentary action he, as an individual member of Government, did not like to pledge his colleagues withou' first consulting them. They would, however, meet that (Saturday) afternoon, and he would bring the subject of the address before them. Mr. Harding, plumber, and fr Smith, coal porter, were then introdiced, and represented the earnest feeling against the tuheatened aggressions which, to their knowled preRailed among the working classes.' The Rev. J. T. BAYLiE, secretary of the Lord's Day Society, also said a few words, reminding his Lordship of ihe Sabbath desecration effort of 1852, which, instead of calizing the boastful anticipation of its originators, elicited a strikin" demonstration of the extent to which the in. dust2ial classes sympathized with the friends of the Sabbath. The Rev. J. KtEIN-G, president of the Wesleyan Conference, testified to the unanimous and strong feelumg of the Methodist connexion, boti ministers and people, against any infringement of the Sabbath, and urged that, at the least, timZeshould be afforded for an expression of the national mind on a question of which such short notice had leen given in the House of Commons. To all these statements Lord Palmerston gave an attentive hearing, and, after mutual expressions of courtesy, the proceedings were brought to a close. Before the members of the deputation dispersed, it was I reported that the ladies of Birmmigham, the sle of IVight, Derby, a¢., had initiated a memorial to the Queen, to be signed specially by mothers. The question-Would such a movement commend itself to the sympathy of those present?-washeartilyrespondedtoin the affirmative; and it was intimated (Lord Shaftesburv being strongly of that opuuion), ltat a number of local petitions would be more enective than one general memoral from all parts of the country.
ADULT11atATION OP FL`oU.-A chaxge of adulterating wheat flour with alum was preferred at the Wake. field Court-house, on M1onday last, against Mr. Abraham Ginn, who carries on the business of maltster and flourdealer on a large scale at that town. It appears that on the 31st nlt. the Mayor of Wakefield (Mr. J. Holdsworth) caused printed notices to be posted on the wallsof the town, cautioong persons against adulterating flour. Ginn had been supected of this practice by the police for some time Fast, and early on Friday morning a constable named Slack cbserved awaggon loaded with flour near Girnms warehouse which led to a search warrant being obtained from the magistrates. A large quantity of wheat and flour was found on thepreraises, and 84sacks of thelatter wereseized. The contents were tested with litmus paper. In 57 of the sacks alum was found mixed with the flour, and in 17 of them it was present in highly deleterious proportions. After a lengthened hearing, the magistrates ordered the 17 bags to be forfeited, and inflicted a penalty of 10L., the condemned flour to be sold for cattle and the proceeds to be applied in equa Eoportions to the Wakefield Soup Kitchen, the Wakeneld Thspensaxy, and the Clayton HospitaL They also ordered the other 40 bags> to be detained for a fortnight for further analysis of the contents previous to its disposal, but in the mneantime inflicted a penalty of 5L, on the defendant; 27 out of the 84 bs.'s seized wvere adjudged to be restored to the defendant. Yihe Myor'strongly animadverted upon the ualp ilty of persons selling adulterated articles of food, and expressed his hope that the pWresent case would aetas a eautiOn to dealers generally; The COUrt waS erowded:. to excess during the hearing of the case.
