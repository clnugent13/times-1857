Much comment and animaadversion has been ;nade upon myconduet in regard to the proceedings attLatield, kwr be It tr Inse to snate One word which can possibly be considered as bringiug Into Quwosto in the slightest degree the honour and purity of intention of any of the gentlemen who composed the O. mmittee which selected me us the retiring member, but I do think. I cannot but think, That they exceeeded ti2eir dutler; these, Inmy idea, were of a poitical nature. thea question left to their arbitrament a ppervained to my political conduct alone, to the consistency of my Practice with the principles wbich [ profe3sed to advocate: and on those points I think I may say writhout arrogance, that I hsa vs not been fenad wanting. The t6oresesttee, however, appear toQ ave unontituted themselves a medlical tribunal. and, in f
to have held an Inquest on the e tain of my hesith, and to have arrived nta verdict without any evidence being adduced: the justico or otherwiSe Of that verdict every day wllU m ake more manifest; to t I have diemurred, and you, gentlemen, have justified my ant by again selecting me a preentaUve.

TO THE EDITOR OF TIE TIMES.
Sir,-Findig that I cannot obtain redress in any other shape, I am induced to expose through the medinm of your columns & gross system of fraud and plunder which is carried on alaUy, and has been so for many years, by railway and steampacket officials. A very glaring instance of this oceurred to me a fow months ago, out of many that have come under my observation. I forwarded a couple of hogsheads of my whisky to a respectable finn in Galwa3 -per rail to Liverpool, steamer to Dnblin1 and thence perail to Galway. The strength of these Pirits when they left me was fully 1 over proof, as taken by the officer, and the cass were properly secured. Whenthcse spiits arnived in Galway they were tried by the officer there, and found only proof, showing that theicssks must have been tampered with, five gaUous taken out of each, and water substituted. In consequence of this I was calledupon by the revenue officials, audmadetopay the duty on the deficiency, amounting to 41. 7g. 5d., besides m customer baving the quaEity of the spirits deteriorated h; the admixture of water. I tried to make the railway company to which I gave the gcods in charge liable, but their defence is that they are only responsible for the length of their own lne, and no further; ad as I found it would have been rather a tedions busines8 for me to inveatipte al, the companies between this and Gailway, I was obliged to give up my claim. I may mention that Sundays seem to be the most convenment dayr chosen by these people for committing their depredations. At one time I could never send a cask by the line (if out over Sanday) but it was sure to be hroacoed. I make a point now to avoid sending whisky to be oat over Sundaq n
The only check I knowr is by your giving these few imperfect lines acorner at some convenent time, and I am sure you will be doing the public, as you do often, a most essentLAI service.
I am, Sir, TOur most obedient rA.rvan:.

ELPIS.
" Oshielle. West Aftlca, October 1, 1856.
To-day I went to Emmere, and was not a littLe surprised at seeing the paCQecovered with many huts and innabited by many people. When I visited it last time therowere but very few huts and inhabitants. The chief, Afonj%, was very glad to see me. In the course of my oonfrestiom with him and some of his people he told me that he fixed his hope upon Mr. - I' promise, that when the plaoe should oe properly built upon an Oyibo should come to reside among them there. After the oonversation he ecOk me round the place th. neighbouring farms. Amengothers he showed me a verr large farm which he ald belooged toShomoyl, the Oob-shozstm of Abbeaka, and he boAstilly directed my attention more particularly to the cott6gi plants. with which the farm was densely eovered, and asked me whether this wsnot one of the things which w Oyjbo wiahed them to plant i abundanee? Vnmy nsweng in the a&irmative he said, 'Well, thatis a proof that w the. E;ghas, do not neglect your advioe, and that we are iot hara to believe what anbody tells us isgood.' Hoi'id, aioreover, that it is their pat to plant ahundtnoe of cotton, aiXwe toldt them, but thae it iB our pertto bnJyit, said Utatwe shall see who fail in their petwe or tfiey."

7-MAR Ta?d (lIT Y)2lTELLTQENCE.
The English f,unds opened t ria morning at a further decline of an eighth, and experienced great heaviness towards the middle of the day, from -' hich there was ultimately a partial reaction. The first transactions in Consols were at 931 tog, and, after having touched 93i, they closed at 3SJ, at -which price there were buyers. For the 7th of IMay the quotation was 93'to .' The transactions were zinimportant, and money was obtainable for short
eriods on Government securities at 6 per cent. eank Stock left off at 220 to 222 with dividend; India Stock, 222 to 224; Exchequer-bonds. 982 to i ; and India Bonds, 5s. discount to par. The Nchequer-bill-market has been rendered heavy by the rise in the Bask rate of discount, and the J une -descriptions closed at (s. to 2s. discount; March, par to 3s. premium.
The payments falling due to-morrow (the 4th) are Unusually heavy, but at the Bank to-day the demand vas moderate. There have been no withdrawals of :gold during the past three days.
Foreign securities showed heaviness, but the *operations were comparatively limited. Turkish -and Mexican were rather lower. Turkish Six per Cents. for money were dealt in at 97i, and for the account at 97i, J, and B. The Your per Cents. Guaranteed' were negotiated at 100I for money, and 101 for the account. 'The other operations comprised-Brazilian, for ao-count, 1001; Ecuador New Consolidated, 15; Peruvian Four and-a- Half per Cents., for money, 77J, 77, and 77i; the Three per Cents., 64 ; Portuguese Three per Cents, 454; Russian Four-and-aHalf per Centa., small, 964; Spanish Certificates, "I, and J per cent.; Dutch Two-and-a-Half per eents., 656; the Four per Cent. Certifieates, 97 and .91 ex div. for moneyj and 97 for the account.
In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates nron Amsterdam and hamburg were a shade higher, but with regard to other places there was no impoitant alteration.
The corn-market was again extremely heavy this anorning, and if sales had been pressed a further -decline must have been submitted to.
The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a moderate businems at steady ynrces.
lThe final quotations of the French Three per -3ents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 69f. -iOc. for money and 70f. 20c. for the end of the mnonih, Bhowing a fall of a half per cent. It appeaiu that the rate paid during the recent ltquidaion for carrying over transactions ranged from 10 to 12 per cent.
The prospectus of the company for constructing -the great Russian railways has been published in P>aris, and it is stated that the issue of the shares is to commence on the 28th inst. The first amount -offered for subscriptionis 300,000,000f.(12,()00,0001.) represented by 600,000 sbares of b50f. each, equal to 125 silver roubles, or 201. sterling. The deDosit to be paid is 1oOf., or 61., per share.
It is stated that Mr. Horsley Palmer is about to resign his post as director of the Bank of England, wbich he has occupied for 46 years. No one connected with that Court or with British commerce has ever occupied a more honourable position in the 'estimation of the public.
Various communications have been received regarding the non-arrival of the A ustralia mail which is supposed to have been despatched from Melbourne by the European and Australian Company's steamer Oneida on the 27th of January. At present no con3ectures can be formed as to the cause of the delay. ThMe Oneida sailed from Southampton on the 19th of O)ctober and arrived at Melbourne on the 23d of Dtecember, She was detained coaling four days at St. Vincent, three at St. Helena, and five at the Cape of Good Hope, so that she made the voyage in 53 days saillng and steaming. The Simla sailed on the 12th of November and arrived at Melbourne -on the 6th of January. She was detained at St. Vincent five days, and consequently made the voyage in 50 days sailing and steaming. The Oneida took the direct route from the equator to the Cape, calling at St. Helena, thus steaming the vb)ole distance from St. Vincent against a strong, steady trade wind, and doubtless greatly lengthened her passage by so doing, whereas the Sinrla, by eciossing the trade wind under sail and steam, soon Rained the parallel of strong fair winds, and avoided all the delay and expense of coaling at St. Helena -and the Cape. These voyages are among the fastest on record; it must therefore be presumed that the non-arrival of the Oneid3 at Suez with the home-ward mails has not arisen from any deficiency in the steaming powers of that vessel, but from some cause yet to be explained, which the arrival of the first steamer will most probably clear up. Her speed on the outward passage was more than 260 miles per day, while the contract time for the cervice is under 240.
In the colonial produce-markets during the week there has been an improved feeling, the late partial inactivity having entirely disappeared. Sugar has -gain attracted much attention, numerous export orders coming forward from various European markets, which, in combination with a more aJm ated inquiry for consumption, led to further speculative transactions, most descriptions closing Is. higher, more particularlythose adapted for home use. Since the result of the Dutch Trading Company's sales became knowvn coffee has assumed a ,much firmer aspect, and the accounts just in from Colombo have also exercised a favourable influence, the market closing at an advance of is. to Is. 6d. for native, and 2s. to 3s. for coloury plantation -Ceylon. The extensive demand for rice noticed last 'week has subsided, and quotations exhibit a slight reduction from the highest point. Most kinds of Epice find a ready sale, and in some cases at enhanced rates. Saltpetre is clull, at a decline of Is. to 2s., which may be partly attributed to the uncertainty regarding future supplies from America. 'The prices of rum have further improved. In the tea-market only a small amount of business has been dtransacted. The intelligence by the China letters, -although considered favourable to an advance, has thus far had no effect upon the prices current at the commencement of the week, and the trade are now -entirely occupied in. preparing for the duty payments, which may be expected to prove very heavy.
The Alustral has arrived from Melbourne, but her -amount of gold remains to be ascertained.
At the Court of Bankruptcy to-day a petition was adjudicated against the estate of Messrs. Copland, Barnes, and Co., who lately failed in the provision trade. The petitioning creditors are Messrs. Earker and Co., and the solicitors Messrs. Linklater.

MlANCBYSTEP., ApaRr, 3.
As compared with the dulness that has prevailed for some weeks past the market Is moderately active, and there is more mnquiry for seve-ra descriptions of cloth. The narrow widths of heavy domestics, such as 26-inch, have met with a better demand, and the lighter makes of print. ing cloths are in more request. 40-inch India shirtings
"ro dsogoing off better at full prices, but longcloths and 3-inch Zirtgs are still dull of sale. For yarms sWited to the markets of India and Gemany there is more business, and spinners readily obtain the smal advance in prioe made on Tuesday. The finer counts are more in dernand for the home trade, and the market generally is very firm.
The demand for linens, according to the circular of fessrs, Richardson, Tee, and Co., of ranchester, has not been so active for this month past as previously, and the maraet for the heavier and coarser clase of Scotch goods was flat at the earlier part of it, but the advices respecting thetsaiffofthe UInited States have given support to it. Prices have rallied and are now firm and likely to be maintained, as the umsal contracts for the home autumn trade as well as for America will ahortly have to be made. The electiors have interfered with the usual course of the home trade for the time being, but as stocks, especially of white goods, are lower than at any other period of the year, the nemporary cessation of dem and is not felt.

vety drifefaddre ss,d i eterez frSomith, when he stated that there was an obliation upon the State to mnake this grant.
It appeased to him that the leading Ronan Catholics of Ireland gave their assitance to Mrd Pitt In carrying the legislative union betwoee the two.'countries upon certain otditions, and that this grant wa one of them, and that a solemn coipact was entered. into on behalf of the State that this grant to the Collegep ofrmaynooth should be continued. (Hear, hear.) He therefore felt that it wonvdhauWust, anudit wotuld virtualy be a breang of the solenes compact that bad been ente-ed inLto by the State, to refuse to allow the pant to be continued. As to the admission of the Jeew to Parliament, it aeed to him that no ian ought to be deprived of any of hiivl rights on account of his reliion. (Hear, hear.) Upon the subject of church-rates, he ft that no mesure was likely to be carxied that did not give satisfaction, first, to the great body of Churchmen, and, socondl, to the great bedy of Dissenters; but ho earnest y hoped that a m keasure ofthis description iighr speedily be brought forward, and that the question might be finally settled. (Hear, hear.) Mr. Martin then etered into a statement of his political opinions, and in th. midst of his observations some on in the crowd called out, "1Turncoat." He deniedI thait he was a turncoat, and he said that no mnan had chbs od leas than he had during the hst 25 years in his po opli inionstoe tetun proee to defend the vote he

m.r. Wainuxa then addresed the electors but just as he commenced the mr.i fell in torrenLts, and h2o was consequently not listened to with mnuch attention. Hlo made a very brief address, and merely expressd his intention to act with his coDeaguea 1dm Martin, and support the same views in case they should both ho returned.
The Rev. Mt. MAznuo:rT (who appeared on the hustings in long hunting boots and breeches and whose anti-clerical appearane occasoionda Agood xzzrs&oe marks in the crowd) said hie should be glad if 7Mr m .ri would inform the electors whether, although he now professd Liberal principles he didi not in 1847 vote for Colonel Austin and Sir E. Filmner.
Mr. MAnRiLYsaid It was true he did so. ("1Hear, bear," and ironical cheer from the friends of Mi. Smith.) He was at that timec in a false, position-namely, the Liberal representative, of a Conservative constituency. (A. laugh.) He -was a general supporter of the _policy of Sir R. Peel, and on thst account hie votedI for Colonel Austin and Sir B.
ilnmer. He felt at the time that he was insa falso position, and the maoment the Peel party was broken up he tooke his own inependent course, and lhe declared that he had alwa%ys been a supporter of Liberal xrmncsples.
Mr.Mikiuonvtlen asledhim*whether he should su?port such a measutre as that which was initroduced by Six W. Clay Upo,n the subject of church.rates.
Mfr. MARTix said that he should have done so.

to his uprightness of mind, philanthropy of conduct, and unfailing steadiness of principle 1 (Cheers.) He was convinced they would tot, and thorefore it only remained fcr him to say a few words with regard to the other candidate. There was his friend Mr. Ro'cert Hanbury, who seemed to be on such good terms with them all that it would be equally unnecesary and impertinent upon his part to comment upon those excellent qualitieg of rwhich they seemed to have an equgi appreciation with himself. (Cheers.) He believed he mihtgsay that he and his father agoreed entirely on all leading pcolitical quc3tions, and it was3 his earnest hope that they would return them both to Parliament. He now came to Viscount Chelsea, who, after having been beaten by their latemember, ir. Bernal Osborne for the borough of Dover, came at the last moment to solieit their suffrages on what he caUed iAberal Conservative priniles.
They had all read his address, no doubt. It was carefully worded, and the small amount of liberalism made the most of. Lord Chelsea was kind enough to say that he wvould make as much use as posmible of Lord Pahnerstoa until he could turn him out (a laugh), after which he supposed he would have no objection to a coalition between Lord Derby and the Peelites, and where would the liberalism go to then? (Cheers and laughter.) They must also recollect that Lord Chelse's vote and his father's on the China question were identical, and that in giving that vote Lord Chelsea, having always been in opposition to the Palmerston Government, was liable to the imputation of wishing to upsot it. They would not refer him to the other two candidates on that account. Neither, he should think, would they be particularly anxioun to send a useful man like Mr. Osborne to Dover and take in exchange the rejected of that borough, who seemed to him har2y worthy to obtain the confidence of such a constituency as Middlesex if be could not retain that of the inhabitants of Dover. (Cheers.) He hoped he should have the satisfaction of hearing before they separated that night that they intended to give their votes for Grosvenor and Hanbury. (Loud cheers.) He could not sufficiently thank them for the klndness with which they had listened to what he had to say, and he felt that he owed them some apology for detaning them so long. (Mr. Grosvenor resumed his seat amid loud and protracted cheering.)
Other gentlemen having addressed the meeting, a resolution was passed with only two or three dissentients, pledging tHenmeeting to support Lord X. Grosvenor a
A numerous and ihfluential meeting was held at tho Royal Sussex A.rms, l3roadway, Hammersmith, yesterday afternoon, to hear laddress from Viscount Chelsea. Mr. H. Pownall, hbairma; of the noble viscount's central comuittee, and eeveral Conservative gentlemen of influence residing I the neighbourhood, were present.
Viscount CisLSzA, who was labouring under so much hoarsenoss that he had some difficulty in making himself heard, said that, in addition to the great exertion of speak. ing yesterday at the nomination at Brentford, he had been invited to attend a meeting at Chelsea, where he had spoken at some length, the result being that he had almost lost his voice. However, his speeches at the meetings he had attended had been reported with so much aceuraoy by the press that he need not
etain them long. The noble viscount then defended his China vote from the charge of factiousness. He also repudiated a charge brought against him by Lord R. Grosvenor, which he did not hear at the hustings in consequence of the clamour that prevailed- the oharge of having adopted a new set of principles for the present election. His prmciples as avowed in his address, and explained upon the hustmgs at Brentford yesterday, differed in nothing from those contained in his addraes to the electors of Dover in 1852, or even from those announced by him in 1841, when he solicited the suffrages of the electors of Reading. (Cheers.) He rebutted the charge made by Lord Robert Grosvenor that the meetings in his favour had been hole-and-corner meetings. He had not been himself engaged in convening them, but they were neither packed meetings nor hole-and-corner meetings. (Hlear.) They were held in the middle of the day, but they were open to all the electors, and he had been acoustomed to associate the ideas of honesty and openneBs with the daylight. {Cheers.) He understood that at one of the nocturnal meetmgs caUed by his opponents the persons present amounted to the imposing number of 13. (Laughter.) He should be ready if returned to bring in a Bil to give one of the vacant seats to the Chelsea, Hammersmith, and Kensington district. He should also be prepared to support any well-considered measure for remedying the present inequality in the poor-rates of the metropolitan districts. At present the wealthier parishessenttheirpoor into the poorer districts, and a crying grievance was thereby created. (Hear, hear.) Lord Chelsea then adverted to the subject of education, the neceesity of providing for the expiry of the income-tax in 1860, and other subjecth, and concluded, amid cheering, by inviting questions from any of the electors present.
Mr. DALY, a publican, said that a proposal had been made in the Elouse of Commons to throw open the trade of the liceDsed victuallers to all the world. Would the noble viscount support the lleensing system against a system of
Viscount C ssAm.-lf a proposal is brought forward to tbrow open the trade, I will oppose it with all my power.
Mr. GRnXXi said that the Established Church in Ireland was the Church of a very small minority, but it enjoyed a very large amount of wealth. Would the noble viscount do anything to lessen the pressure of that Church upon the people of Ireland?I
Viscount CVLESBJi said he should resist to the utmost of his power any proposal for the spollation of the Irish
Mr. AiNsWonT= moved, and Mr. HALFORD seconded, a vote of confidence in Lord Chelsea, which was carried with about a dozen dissentients.
The meeting separated with the usual acknowledgment to tho chairman (Mr. J, Bird).
SOMERSET (EAST).
Tho election of two knights of the shire to represent the eastern division of Somerset took place yesterday at Wels. There was no opposition to the return of Mr. W. Miles and Lieutenant-Colonel Knatchbull.
Mr. JOLLIFFX, of Ammerdown-park, proposed Mr, W. Miles for re-election; Mr. ADDINGToN seconded tan onination.
Mr. PAGET nominated and Mr. NAP= s seconded Lieutenant-Colonel KnatchbulL
No other candidate being proposed, the HIG SHEZRIFF (Sir Arthur Hallam Elton) declared Messrs. miles and KnatehbuU duly elected.
Mr. MILES was the first to address the electors. With reference to the China question he expressed his opinion that SirJohn Bowring was not a proper person to represent this country in China and that had Lord Palmerston announced some days before Le did that it was his intention to send Lord Elgin to China to inquire snto the dispute there would not have been a division, or he would have triumphed by a large majority. He should go to Parliament to support no party or set of men; and, however much he was attached to his own party, if that party did anything offensive to the general principles which he entertained, he should not be a.shamed to hold up his hand against them. He should act entirely as an independent man, and not as a bound delegate. Mr. Miles also referred to the question of national education, and declared his intention to support only such measures as were based on relgious principles On the subject of peace 3lr. Miles declared that he was not in favour of intermeddling too muchvwith other nations; but the honour of the nation must be upheld, and no man in Parliament would he more willing than himself to support any Ad. ministration that bade defiauce to those who would in any way infringe on the liberties of the people.
Mr. KNATCIBULL, in his address, referred to the accusation that those who had recently voted against the Governn ent had formed a factious coalition to overthrow the
.linisters. He gave an empbatioc denial to such a charge, anid expreseed his regret that Lord Palmerston should stoop to such unfair meaus to lower his opponents in the estimnation of the country. He a,reed with his colleague that Sir John Bowring was not a fit representative of this country in China, and that no commissioner or agent of this country abroad should have the power to plunge us into war without instructions from home. He declared that he miuver gave a vote with more willingness in his life than the one on the China question. He consi.lered the war hid not only been commenced unjustly, but had been continued with more severity than was required. _le was convinced that if Lord Palmerston had intimated his intention before the division to send a plenipotentiary to China the business of the country need not have been interrupted, and his Government would have been saved.
e was of opinion that the army and navy should be efllciently kept up, but such proper economy should be exercised in other 8mattersas to admitbof the extinction of
The proceedings closed with the usual vote of thanks to the Hgh Sheriff.
CHESEIRE (SOUTH).
The nomination of two fit and proper persons to represent tbe southern division of the county of Chester in the next Parliament took place yesterday (Friday), in the Castleyard, Chester; Mr. W. Atkinson, High Sheriff, in the chair.
31r. EwiNs CsCORBETT, of Tilstone Lodge, proposed, and Captain ANTROBUS, of Antrobus-hall, seconded the nomiuation of Sir Philip De Malpas Grey Egerton, of Oulton Park.
Mr. JANCS FRA Ycx FRANCE, of Bostock-haJ , proposed, and Mr. J. DEtA CASE, Of POulton Hay, seconded the nomination Mr. John Tollemache, of Peckforton Castle.
A show of hands was called for, and the two gentlemen noniinated were declared duly elected.
Sir PIIuLi GRGE EGERTON expressed himself aConservative in principles. He had given Lord Derby, while in office, a steady support, only voting against him once, on the free trade question. Of Lord Aberdeen's Ministry he thought the east said the better. He did not envy the character which it bore in the country, and which would be handed down in history. Upon the Chinese question he voted against the Government, and did so simply on the merits of the case. He entirely disapproved of any Govern. ment delegating to officials in another quarter of the globe the gigantic power of p a a o war. (Hear, hear.) He did not think it right that any servant of the Govetnment should have the power to declare war, carry it
on, mud conclude it without the knowledge of Parha aent He did not like the splits i n Lord P simersons party and
did not think he should ever be able to attach himself to that Minister. He thought Lord Derby in every way the momt fit to be at the head of affairs, and should give him on all rocasions a steady support. He was in favour of peace, hut not peace at any price (hear, hear)-peace consistent with the honour of England he s hould ever uphold. (Cheers.) There was a local question which had caused some stir-the River Weaver dUes, and he should oppose the Bill at present before parliament, which sought to deprive the county of 20,0001. a-year, and put it into the pockets of some salt proprietors at LiverpooL, (Cheers.)
Mr. ToLLB3ACHE als expressed himself as a Conserva,ive in principles. Ho Toted in the minority on the China luestion because he beliered the opposition which had been
wised was a factious one, and done solely to overturn Lord ?alneraton!a Administration. (Hear, hear.) He should rote forthe maintenance of the arMy and navy in an efficient *Aate. He should vote for a reduction of the ezpenditure; X thought in civil affairs they had become extravagant. lo wod do ho bet- to get the income-tax renioved in 8C0. e, wss in favouAr of a soand education for the
masses; an education combining moral with religious instruction. He would uphold the Church so long as she reu;aied true to her Protestant prinoiples. He was opposed to the grant to Maynooth, to the admission of Jews into Parliamet, andi to tne opening of places of amusement on the
Avote of thanks to the HIigh Sheriff concluded the pro-
ANGLESEA.
Yesterday the election of a member to represent this county in Parliament took place at Beaumaris.
The only candidate was Sir Richard WiUiams Bulkeley, the late member, who was re-elected without opposition.
Sir R. W. BULKELLY addregsed the electors at some length. He regretted to say that in the recent adverse vote to the Government some Liberals had joined with the Tories and Peelites to upset the Ministry. He considered Lord Palmerston the nan for the time-; thorouigh Englishman, the mention of whose name strack terror into the hearts of aU European despots, from Con. stantinople to Norway, and so long as his Lordship showed A disposition to meet the wants of the country he should have his support. Ho (Sir Richard) was opposed to any further increase in colonial bishop. ric, and also to the withdrawal of the Maynooth grant. He was in favour of the abolition of church-rates, the continuance of which was productive of bad feeling. More churches had been built and put in repairbythe voluntary system in Anglesea in 10 years than would have been done by church-rates in 50 years, and he thought the voluntary principle would be found to act well if applied to the country generally. He was friendly to increased education, but ho considered the schemes propounded by Sir John Pakington and Lord John Russell impracticable. He thought the better plan would Vbe to make denominationalgrants. Hewas opposed to the ballot. He wished to see a further reductionin the national expenditure, would vote for a committee to take evidence as t o the best means of checking the evils arising from the un-
liited consumption of spirits by the lower classes, and would sapport the opening of the British huseum and other places of rational amusement on the Sunday.
he proceedings terminated with a vote of thanks to the igh Seriff.
WARWICXSEHmE (NORTH).
The nomination of candidates took place at Coleshill yesterday, and, there being no opposition to the re-election of Messrs. Newdigate and Spooner, the proceedings passed off without any of that display of party strife which hadchaacterized previous nDominations.
Sir GFOnGw CIr-ND proposed Mr. C. N. Newdigate, Mr. C. B. ADD2RLEY seconded the nomination.
Mir. J. M. BoULTBIEs proposed Mr. Richard Spooner; Mr. R. W. WINrFILD briefly seconded the nomination.
As there were no other candidates to be prosed, the UNDER.SIEnr1F declared Messrsm Newdigate and Spooner duly elected.
Air. C. N. NEwDroATE returned thanks. His conduct and motives were known to his constituents, and it was higbly gratifying to himself to have merited a renewal of their confidence. They would remember that in 1854 the question of the manufacture of small-arms had engaged much of his attention, and he had attended upon the committee of the House of Commons appointed to consider that subject. The hon. gentleman, at considerable length, dwelt upon the advantages that Warwickshire derived from that trade, and censured the Government for sending their orders for arms to foreign countries during the late war. It was stated by one of their officials that E.ngland was not capable of supplying 30,000 stand of arms per year, whereas 270,000 had been manufactured in two years, being nearly five times the quantity. With reference to Lord Palmerston, he deniedhaving offered any factious opposition to his Lordship. He had voted with him when he could conscientiously do so. He was, no doubt, a high-minded and spirited British Statesman, but he could not approve all his political conduct. Upon the Chinese questiGn he, Mr. Newdigate, felt bound to vote in favour of Mr. Cobden's motion and against the Government. The hon. gentleman then proceeded to notice the various qestions of importanca which had been brought before the
House during the late session, and which would in all probability be again introduced. Among one of the most important questions was that of the admission of the Jews, and against which he had voted with a view to the preservation of the Christian character of the British Senate. He also alluded to the Maynooth question, and expressed his entire concurrence in the course which had been pursued by his hon. colleague Mr. Spooner, and his determination to support him tin any future efforts he might make to disallow the grant..
Mr. SpooNER next presented himself and was cordially received. He said that was the fifth time that he had been returued to Parliament, but the first time without an opnosition, from which he now not unreasonably inferred that his old opponents as well as his friends were satisfied with bis conduct, and had resolved upon alowing him to go to Parlament without further trouble. The hon. gentleman then proceeded to review the acts of the late Parliament and the causes whichled toitsdismemberment, amon whichstood prominentlyforwardtheChinesequestion. eha votedto the uest of his judgment upon thatimportant subject, and against Ministers, but most certainly from no factious motive, or any other desire than that of doing what he conceived to be that which was best caloulated to uphold the honour and character of the nation. With reference to the Maynooth grant, Mr. Spooner detailed the various efforts which hie had made for disalowing the grant, and expressed his determination to renew them in the ensuing Parliament. After dwelling upon the efforts which had been made to introduco Jews in Parliament, and expressing his intention to vote against that measure, he proceeded to urge the necesrity of the Government's pursuing the utmost economy consistent with the honour and dignity of the country. He would oppose al useless extravagance, but it would be with him a special consideraton to maintain in a high state of efficiency the army and navy of England.
Thanks having been givren to the Under Sheriff the proceedinga terminated.

thus giving the Liberal candidate a najority of 515 over one Conservative and 176 over the other. It was a hollow race througbout; Lord AIthoD took the lead and kept it, innprovingbis position evcryhour. The extent of their success has surprised even the most stnguine of the Liberals, and many began to lament early in the day that they had not started a second csndidate. Lord A.ltborp has polled many more votes than any Liberal cadidate before 1im, and even in Daventry and Brackley districts, the Conservative strongholds, e has polled neck and neck. In the Northampton districts his majority is very large. This att'e, itais expected, will deoide the representation for some time to come.
The official declaration will take place on Monday.
SCOTLAND.
STIRLING (COUNTY).
On Thursday the nomination of a candidate to represent the county of Stirling in Parliament was proceeded with on hustings erected in front of the Courthouse, Stirling.
Shexiff Baillie having read the writ,
Mr. W. STIRLLNG, of Keir, proposed the re-election of Mr. P. Blackburn, of Killearn; and Sir A. CAFBXnLn, of Garseube, seconded the nomination.
The SHERIFF then asked (there being no other candidate) for a Ahow of hanTds in Mr. Blackburn's favour, when three or four among the crowd were held up.
The SIIERIFF then deolared Mr. Blackburn duly elected.
Mr. BLACKBURN, in returning thanks, denied that the vote he bad given against the Government on the Chinese qmestion was a factious one. Lord Palmerston had made up his nind for a dissolution. It must have been be. cause his Government would not be able to go on through the session without it, and so he looked about for a popular subject and determined to go to the hustings on it. The British lion was rather a formidable animal. They had all heard often enough about the Scottish lion, but when the British lion got its tail over its back and began to roar it was very formidable indeed. On it he meaut to ride, and it was wonderful how he succeeded. At present the subject of the war with China had rather gone by, and the question now was, whetber the confadence of the country shoutd be given to Lord Palmerston's Government or no ! (" No, no !") He should rather say to Lord Palmerston himself, for who ever talked of the rest of the Government? No doubt there was a Minister for the Colonies, Mr. Lay bouchere; for the Home Department Sir George Grey; for the Admiralty, Sir Charles Wood; but did anybody pust now ask what they were saying or doing? It was
aimerston, and Palmerston alone-ho was the Govern. ment. He (Mr. Blaokburn) rather agreed with the gentleman in the crowd who said " No," for he did not himself think agreat deal of Lord Palmerston's Government and when they saw the prospect of a better they might taik of pUtting him out; hut in the meantime he aptpeared to be the only possible Minister, so that he had no intention oE attempting to oust himn. After a reference to the supply oE guano he expressed himself in favour of economcy whenever practicable. In our miscellaneous expenditure large sums were given to commissioners for doing nothing Another source of over outlay were theParks aboutLondon Four years ago 11,0001. was expended in this way, and last year it rose to 25,0001. To this he (Mr. Blackburn) objected m Parlament, but could not get it cut do Everybody admitted that Sir J. M'NeiUl and Colonel TuUoch had made a most able report, and pointed out serious and innumerable evils; but what reward did they get 9 Why, at first none at all, and when people began to be discontented at their getting no honours, 1,0001. was offered to each of them. Was it creditable in the head of the Ministry to treat them so, and to say, as he (Mr. Blackburn) had heard him say, that Mr. Sutherland's report was the more valuable of the two-one that the country had never heard of ? It was an odd thing that whenever Englishmen went wrong they sent for Scotchmen to put them right, Sir John Bowring went wrong in the China affair, and a Scotehman Lord Elgin was sent out to put him right. dr. Blackbar. tben proceeded to explain bis own views on political reform, as indicated in his address. He begged to state that he had not the sightest intention of bringing in a Bill to reform the cons=tition, and it was quite absurd in any private member of Parliament to think of bringing in a Bill to alter all the laws of tbe land. He did not consider it necessary, therefore, to define precisely the points on which he had made up his mind. But if any Ministry should bringin areallyreasonable, well-considered measure to exend the representative systm, he would be in favour of it. Ho had no great objections to a 101. franchise for the counties, and if Government brought In a bill perfect in other respects that would not stand in his way. He would just remark on this point that Reformers from the burghs who were so anxious about the reform of the counties did not appear to thinkao much of the towns ; but for his part he considered that when the county franchise as lowered, the same should be the Oem in towns. Whether it should be 51. precisely or not he
did not mean to say. As to the ballots he did not like it, and its introduction at present would be most ujnust to non-electors, who were entitledto know how their neighboursvoted.If uiversa. sufhge came about, that objection would be to a great extent done away with, but the balot would be stll a mean underhand way of discharg. iDg a duty. As to electoral districts, nobody surely could expect that he would vote for members to be given accordmg to the population. Would any one seriously ay that London should have more members than all Scotlandc? The fact was, London had too many members already, andreumed the worst in the House of Commons, there being more jobbing done for London than for anywhere else, from the proximity of the members. The present system, no doubht was rather anomalous, but it muight be amended without going to such au extreme. He (Mr. Blaclkburn) considered it a great mistake to send men of the same political views to Parliament from a constituency. On the contrary, they should be of different views, so as to repressnt different interests. Mr. Blackburn then took up the question of educafton, and passed some animadversions on the Lord-Advocate's Bill, In conclusion, he did not go to Parliament to offer any factious opposition to Lord Palmerston. He wished him to stay in for a time, but, in the course of nature, a successor must same time or other be looked to. He wanted, in the meantime, to see what measres he brought forward, and either to be for or against them aS they merited support or opposition.
After a vote of thanks to the Sheriff the proceeding terminAted.
THE WIGTOWN BURGHS.
At the last moment a candidatb appeared to contest the representation of the Wigtown burghs in the person of Mr. Layard, late M.P. for Aylesbury. Up till Tuesday, the 31st ult., it was generally supposed that Sir William Dunbar, of MIochrum, who entered the field upon the retirement of Sir John M`Tagart, would be permitted to "walkthe course." On tbat day, however, Mr. Layard, accompanied by Mr. Caird, the newly elected member for Dartmouth, arrived at Garbeston per steamer from England, and on the same evening Mr. Layard addressed meetings in Withorn and Wigtown, in explanation of the reasons which had led him to come forward as a candidate. At the meet. ing in Wigtown a vote of confidence in Mr. Layard was passed unanimo-isly and amid great applause. In his speech at the latter place Mr. Layard described at great length the circumstances under which he had comeforward; he said that the independent members who sat in the House of Commons, notwitstanding that they were the originators of almost all the most important measures passed into law, were found to be so troublesome and intractable in reference to their support of the Government that the latter would gladly see them out of the House, and the recent divsion on China afforded an opportunity toLord Palmerston at once to punish the independent members (among whom he was prond to rank himself one) for their conscientious voting on that occasion, and to get rid of them altogetber. The conxequence of that vote was a dissolution of Parliament and an appeal to the country, with the ory of " Hurrah for Palmer. ston and China !" and that step resulted in the rejection of suc4 able and tried reformers and benefactors to their country as Mr. Cobden, Mr. Bright, Mr. Milner Gibson, Sir William Clay, Sir Joshua Walmaley, Mr.Otway, Mr. Apsley Pellat, and others. He asked the WigtowFn constituency to retur him to Parliament, not because he had any fo&as
ambition to be a member of the Legislature, but because he, believed he could yet be useful to his country in the House of Commons.
On Wednesday, April 1, the nomination of candidates took place.
lr. KxRR, banker, Straurser proposed Sir William Dunbar, Bame W'Uwm, of Wigtown, seconded the nomination.
WIr. JA3SM CAIBD, of Baldoon, MX. for Dartmouth, proposed Mr. Layard, but before doing so asked the permission of the Sheriff to put some questions to SirWilliam Dunbar, which might have the effect of considerably modifying the coul8e which the friends of Mr. Layardwould avis that gentleman to pursue on the present occasion.
Mrr. Caird was about to ask if Sir William Dunbar would vote for the ballot, but he was met by cries of "Propose your candidate," and ultimately, after a good deal of angry uproar, the Sheriff deemed it advisable that Mr. Caird snould first propose his friend, and then put any questions he pleased.
Mr. CAsmD having proposed Mr. Layard at some lengtb, describing the defeat of Mr. Layard, MIr. Cobden, hir. Milner Gibson, and several other independent memabers of the House of Commons as the result of an extraordinary combination of circumstances, the motion was seconded by Mr. GORDONi, of Cralgadam, Stranraer.
Sir W. DUNWAu then eddressed the electors at considerable length, commenting in sarcastic terms upon the appearance of MIr. Layard to contest the election at the last moment. Sir William then proceeded to express his high approval of Lord Palmerston's policy in regard to the late proceedings at Canton. He would vote for an extended measure of education, and for improving the condition of schoolmasters. As a sincere Protestant, be would do all that in him lay to sustain the great principles of the Reformation. He was in favour of retrenchment in all branches of the public servioe. He would vote for an extension of the suffrage, and would have supported Mr. Lccke King's motion had he been in Parliament. He was not in favour of the ballot. In conclusion Sir William paid some high compliments to Mr. layard as a man who had cut celebrity for himself out of the bowels of the earth; who had, with a rare research, unfolded to us the marvels of past ages, and whose discoveries had shed a light upon the aoubting mind. (Loud cheers.)
Mr. LAYARD, on coming forward, was received with prolonged and most enthusiastic cheering. He said that the electors of Wigtown seemed to be labouring under a strange delusion. (Laughter.) By the way in which they had just received him he should fancy that they took him for that eloquent man whose fame extended over the length aud breadth of the land, and whose Demosthenic eloquence they had just heard (laughter), and that they took his opponent (Sir William Dunbar) for the rejected of Aylesbury, a man unknown to fame, and whose name had not traveUed far beyond the boundaries of a provincial town. (Cheers and laughter.) He only trasted that the delusion would continue until they returned him by the same mistake at the head of the poll. (Cheers and laughter.) Hoe was sorry to say that he had little or nothing in his hat (referring to the notes made use of by his opponent while delivermg his address). (Laughter.) Heremembered once seeing a conjuror, in presence of a very large crowd of persons, take out of his hat, which appeared to be empty, and distribute among about 200 people a quantity of flowers. The flowers of eloquence which they had seen that day proceeding from a hat were very much like the flowers he saw on that oecasion-they were all tinsel and paper. (Great langhter.) He had listened with great attention to his honourable opponent in order to ascertain what his principles were. His (Mr. Layard's) position there greatly depended upon the principles his opponent professed, but for the life of him he could not understand what he meant. The same eonjuror t) whom he had referred had on one occasion shown some very extraordinary effects of what he called optical delusion. The spectator first saw a lion ; when he put forward his hand to touch it - the lion turned into a dog, but the dog proved equally substantial, and when the spectator touched it he found the dog had become a jackass. (Great laughter, and confusion.) Now, he did not mean to make any personal observation (laughter); he did not mean to apply the term "jackass" to his hon, opponent, but he merely wished to expain an optical delusion. (Great laughter.) Sir willim Dunb ars Political princples appeared to him to be very much- of that kind, for the more he was pressed upon to explain the more rapid was their disappearance. (Laughter.) In his travels he had once seen a very curious way of catching partridges, in which the use of two large wings or flaps, made of paper, and fmtened on a framework of wood carried by a boy, had the effect of frightening the birds and making them creep into a corner and allow themselves to be taken. Now, he generally found that those gentlemen who professed extreme liberality in their politica principles always came down upon the electors with the two great wings or flaps of the British constitution-civil and religious liberty, -and with nothing more. (Cheers and laughter.) The unfortunate electors very soon Allowed themselves to be caught by this device, and werespeedily fleeced and eawen up in a mouthful. Laughter.) Layard, after yaying a high compliment to Etch copstittuencies, proceeded to analyze Sir W. Dunbar's address, maing special reference to his views on the baUot, the introduction of which he said would effect a very great cbange in the present political state of the Wigtown burghs, and which, if it were then in existence, would return him (Mr. Layard) as their representative to Parliament. He also condemned his inconsistency in proclaiming himself a supporter and admirer of Lord Palmerston, and at the same time saying he would have voted for Mr. Locke King's motion for an oxtension of the suffrage. He said that the local claims of his hon. opponent and himself were equal, for neither of them resided in the district, and he thought that his services to the country in the past might be fairly held to counterbalance those of Sir W. Dunbar. His hon. opponent said that he would have voted for Lord Palmerston on the China question. Well, that cry could not last for ever; the electors warted some more distinct pledges. Lord Palmerston was an old man, and it was not probable that he would hold the reins of government ~or seven years; and what would such representatives as Sir W. Dunbar do when Lord Palmerston was not at the bead of the Government, which he predicted he would not be within a few months 7 ir. Layard went on to defend his vote on China, and scouted the charge of conspiracy and combination brought against those who had voted against Government on that occasion. The House of Commons was ready, in the case of the Russian war, to support the Government by every means at its disposal, because that was a war against a gigantic enemy, and m the cause of the weak against the strong; but when the proceedings at Canton were made known to the House of Commons they refused to sanction those proceedings, and said, "We will support you against the strong, but not against the weak," rCheer..) What had been the consequence of the vote against Government on that question of China? He was there before them, as had been said, the rejected of Aylesbury. But more eminent nmen than he, and whose loss in the House of Commons and to the country would be much more severely felt than his, had been rejected by their conetituencies. Mr. Bright, the champion of the people of England and of cheap bread, who bad sacrificed his health and all that was most precious in the cause of the people-what had happened to him? An ungrateful constituency had relieved him of the trust which they had formerly reposed in him. (Cheers.) Whit had happened to Mr. Cobden, Mr. Milner Gibson, Sir William Clay, and other Liberal men in the House of Commons? They had been punisbed for giving an honest and consclentious vote. (Cheers.) Mr. Layard spoke upon other iopics, defending the grant to Maynooth so long as the sytEm of religious endowments prevailed-a system which he would ever oppose; and defending the opening of the Crystal Palace gardens on Sunday. In conclusion, Mr. Layard made
:very pointed reference to the backstair influence bv which
his opponent wa pported, and id that if retred to Parlament he would faithfully and diligently attend to the interests of his constituents. Mr. Layard, whose address was a spirited and telling one, was loudly cheered at the close.
The SsUFRIFF then took a show of hads. About a dozen hands were held up for Sir WillismDunhar, andavery laTgr numiber for Mr, Layard, in whose favour the Sheriff de-
dared the demonstration to be. A pollhaving been demanded for Sir William Dunbar,
Mr. LAYAnD came forward and intimated thLt, owing to the lateness of his arrival in the field and the peculiar cir. cumstances in which the Wigtown bmrghs were placed, he did not feel it necessary to go to a polL
Sir Wiiliam Dunbar was then declared to have been elected as member of Parliament for the Wigtown district of bnrghs.
A vote of thanks to ibe Sheriff and three cheers for Wr. I,yard dosed the proceedings
Mr. Layard and Mr. Caird were drawvn through the town in a carriage by the populace on coming down from the hustings as a marlk of respect and sympathy.
WVIcK BuscHs.-Mr. Shaw, who retired in favour of Lord John Hay, though first in the field, has asked Lord John to withdraw, Mr. Laing having retired. Lord John refused. Mr. Shaw again enters the field, and Mr. Laing's supporter have taken him up. The nomination takes plae -n Monday.
IRELA:ND.
The result of Thursday's returns leaves the balance of Partie sin the cities and boroughs pretty much as it stood in the last Parliament. Liberal apathy in Belfast-the Irigh MAnchester-has had its fruits in the re-election of the two Derbyites-one of whom, and the more competent, is only connected with the town by the accident of birth ; Mr. Cairns being a member of the English bar, while his col. league, Mr. Davison, is also a professional mLn, being a sollcitor of hh standing in the town. But, however eminent each may3oe in his respective sphere, it is strange that the C,onservative prty could not have hit upon at least one man cennected with the mercantile or manufactnring interest to represent, strictly spekng, the only commercial constituency inl Iwreland. Tho speculative electors of the borough of Sligo have restored to their confidence Mr. John Patrick Somers, who is once more their representative, and have dismised the Right Hon. John Wynne, the Late Conserva. tive member, and certainly one of the most popular resident proprietors in Ireland. How came it that Mr. Under-Secretary Ball took fright at the eleventh hour? Had he stood fast, might not that gentleman, instead of Mr. Somers, have won this remarkable victory ? Independent oDposition and the Elector-General of Ireland have susained a mortifying and unexpected reverse in the return of SirTimothy O'Brien for the borough of Cashel, Mr. Jobn Lonigan, their champion, being actually the third and lszt at the close of the PolL Mr. John Francis Magnire has defeated the moderate Conservative, Sir Nugent Humble, and is now for the third time member for Dungarvon. Mr. J. Richardson, a lAberal, a namesake and relative of the late member, beat the Conservative candidate, Colonel Hogg, son of Sir Janmes Weir Hogg, the ex-member for Honiton.
MONAGHA?f (COuiiTY).-The northern papers announce that Mr. St. Aubyn Barrett Lennard is a candidate for the representation of the county Monaghan. His interests are supported by Lord RossinoreandLordCremorne and by many of the gentry of the county, who hold Mr. .Len nard in high esteem. Mr. Lennard is grandson of Sir Thomas Lennard, and is himself alarge landed proprietorin the, county. In his address, Mr. Lennerd Esys he holds principles of improvement and reform; that he is, and ever has been, an ardent supporter of the prnciples of civil and religious liberty, and is prepared at all times to use his best endeavours for the promotion of so oust and holy a cause. He adds:-" Doubtless, one of the first resolutions which will be brought before the House of Commons after the assembling of the next Parliament will have for its object the displacement of the present Ministry, in which case, should you pay me the great honour to which I now aspire of returning me as your representative, I shall give my firm support to the present government, as, in my opinion, no men is so capable to conduct the affairs of the nation, under the present cirumstances, as Lord Palmerston, who has been ably desrbed as the eaemy of the enemies of our country." Notwithitaud ing that Mr. Iennard has been invited by the leading and most influential Liberal electors of the county to offer himcell for the representation, it is anticpated he will not be successfuL
WA,.TEREoRD (CoUETY).-There is a vage runmour to the effect that Sir H. W. Barron, not satisfied with his signal defeat forthe city, maeans to try his luck in a contest for the county of Waterford.
Wxcow (CoTY).-It has been rnmoured for some time that a candidate in the Liberal interest is about to oppose Mr. Hume in the countyof Wicklow, but as yet no confirmation of the statement has appeared. Parties in Wicklow are said to be very evenly balanced. The Dublin Post announces that the Hon. Captain Richard Monck, brother to Lord Monck, is likely to be the candidate. The Post says -" CaptainMonck has seenmuch service in everypart of the globe, and distinguished himself greatly in the Caffde war; and on the breaking out of hostilities with Rusoia he at once volunteered his services, and was on his return from India to the Crimea when peace was prodlaimed. His younger brother, who was also a captain in the army, fell at the battle of the Alma. The public, no doubt, recollect the gallant fight he made, and how, although wounded, he aid low the first two or three of the enemy who attaked him.',

LONDON, SATURDAY. APRIL 4, 1857..
It is possible to have too much of a good thing,-too much time, too much money, too many friends, too Lauch siupport, and so to hold them
too cheap and throw them away. 'Who does not lknow what it is to have half a day to get ready for a sbort journey, and to lose one's train in consequence? Lord PL_MEMSTO1N will start with too good a majority. He will have too large a margin to draw upon, and it will be a matter of indifference to him whether half-a-dozen or so become careless, or sulky, or queer, and leave him for somebody else or nobody else. A majority is a thing that must be used. " There is a tide in " the affairs of men." A good majority is high water, which will carry you safe out to sea if you have everythin.g ready, and can use it without a moment's delay; but will strand you at the sill of your own dock-, or break your back on the mud before its gates, if you are five minutes too late. A Parliamentary majority is nothing on earth but a snow giant. It looks big and strong, but is melting aud crumbling away from the houlr it was made. PEEL started in 1841 with an imposing and overwhelming majority of 90, and people seemed to think it must last for ever, and that Conservatism was to usher in the Milleenium. But, whether a majority be great or small, it may be observed that in the third or fourth year of a Parliament the MiDister finds increasing difficulty in keep-ng his men together. Certain feelings, not quite on the surface, are evidently at work, which undermine the whole outward form of things, and the Ministerial party is apt to become like a ship the timbers of which are whole to the eye, but rotten within. The majority must be worked; it must be committed ; it must be animated and raised in self-respect by the consciousness of doing something and being a working and meritorious majority. An idle majority will leave you or bring you to grief, as surely as an idle son, or an idle servant, an idle horse, or anything that is idle. So Lord PALMEERSTON must immediately find work for his majority. The more recondite question of reward and encouragement we willingly leave to more knowing advisers. Tbe warmest love requires tokens, and no doubt a Minister must dispense keepsakes, mementoes, and sweet suggestive gifts of all kinids. That, however, is not by any means so important as work. Better be in debt to a member of Parliament than have no aecount at all with him, no services given or received. In fine, Parliament must be worked; the larger the majority the more it must be worked; and the sooner it is fairly in harness the better.
So, before the majority flags, or splits, or rots, or melts, and takes to some deliberate iniquity not yeD revealed by time, but always to be apprehended,-parbicularly when there are such able suggesters-Lord PAL31xRSTOW must provide it with measures. He can be at no loss for them, as there are about as many arrears in Parliament as there used to be in Chancery. ;For example, there is the law of Joint-stock Banks to be put on a proper footing. There is another more solemn form of partnership, the law of which is most lamentably deficient for aU reasonable purpozes. Every day shows more and more the miseries and wickedness resulting from the present state of the law of Marriage and Divorce. It is only a question of time, for nobody can doubt that besore very long we shall have a Courb to do that for aU classes wlich Parliament now does by special Acts for the few who can pay. The announcements made at the beginning of February seemed to cut out some work on various other subjects, and that work ought by this time to be in a still better state of preparation. But, by the confession of all parties, foreign affairs have comparatively suspended domestic legislation for the last three years, and there is an unusual number of remanets. This we maintain to be an advantage rather than a difficulty to a Minister who takes a fresh start with a new Parliament. He has to employ them, to keep them out of harm's wry, to occupy their interest, and even their affections. Schoolboys don't care a straw for an idle master. They neither love him nor respect him. If he works them hard, they respect hin, at aU events; they know they do this, and they like him even more than they are aware of. Now, here not only is a majority, but, we believe, mora than a hundred men who were not in the last Parliament. There seldom were so many new men, and, let people talk as they wil about the unneczessary character of the question on wh:ch Lord PALmErSToN took the sense of the nation, the nation evidently is of another op;nion on that subje3t; for it has responded to the appeal by making a considerable change of the men. These new men, these raw levies, have plenty of work in them, and it rests with Lord PALMELSTO-N to see that they are fully employed.
Moreover, the work ouglht to be carried on with a high hand. The peculiar circumstances under which many of these members have been returned -that is very much on the question of PALMAmRSTON or somebody else-do not allow one to expcct that they wiU hold to their election pledges longer than men usually do. There is much that they will do this Session which they may not do so promptly the next, and which they may possibly have no heart at all for the Session after. It cannot be denied that Lord PALMERSTON's position, this affair of China once settled, becomes eminently a personal one. There is no harn in that, but, when it is so, all depends on the man. If lhe fails, if he no longer shows himself the man that people looked for-and they look for it in his measures-there are then men enough to fall to besides him. Instead of one party against another party, with some forty neutrals and independents, Lord PALMERSTON has half-a-dozen leaders to struggle with-Mr. DisRALLi, Mr. GLADSTONE, Lord JoHN RussELL, and Mr. CoBDnnm, who, though absent, wil still be present, aU representing various shades of opinion; and it is very hard if everybody caunot find shelter under one of them. So, at the smallest provoca-
tion, any one of Lord PAL.MERSTONNS supporters will find among the four sections one that suits' his present state of mind. Or he can ride and tie with the whole four, all the time ostensibly a Ministerialist. He may join Mr. DISRAELI on some landed interest question; Mr. GLADSTONE on some chtirch or colony or financial question; Lord JOHN RUSSELL on some constitu-
tional question; and Mr. COBD&N on some economical question. Thus the present state of the House of Commons gives great facilities for the commission of smaU political crimes, instead of one big one ; petty larcenies instead of one huge robbery; continual breaches of discipline instead of open rebellion; sne0lking flirtations instead of one downright elopement. It is a time for the trial of principle, and many will be found wanting. TIhey wiU all go off, one way or another, this Session or the next, unless Lord PALMERSTON keeps them all {e their work, declares a policy, produces his measures at once, urges them strongly, carries them 'with a high hand, and does not leave his Parliament, if he can help it, even the leisure to go wrong.
The QUEEN has been invited to discharge one of
The QUEEN has been invited to discharge one of the most interesting and poetical duties of empire, and one of very rare occurrence. She is aaked to decide between the rival claims of as many as four or five cities to be the seat of the Canadian Government. At present we can scarcely estimate the importance of the question. Before long it is probable that all British America Will be under one Government; and, at the
present rate of increase and improvf6nent, by the end of another centurythe population will.. be as numerous, as wealthy, and as advanced in al the arts of life as that of the mother country. It is, then, the metropolis of an empire such as ours that has to be selected. The occasion sends one bacsk to the earliest origins and to the grandest epochs of history-to the Tower of BELus and the walls of Ecbatana, to VIrorL's picture of infant Carthage, and LIrv's legend of young Rome; to ALs.XYDrni laying out with a line the city which still bears his name and justifies his sagacity; to CONSTA-TnmE founding, umwittingly, the seat of an anti-Christian empire, and PETER the GREAT driving piles into the mud of the Neva. The origin of cities, indeed, is generally wrapt in obscurity, and it is by the merest accident that they have become what they are. Even in our own time we have seen the seed of cities sown broadcast over new continents, some to wither or languish, some to ahoot up into colossal proportions. In the memory of old men there was not an Englishman on the Australian continent, and within the lifetime of schoolboys there was no such place as Melbourne,-now a magnificent city, with more than a hundred thousand inhabitants. In the heart of the North American Continent the oldest inhabitant of Chieago-a man of about 50-finds himself surroumded by a vast city, and at the centre of an immense commerce. But probably there never was an occasion when deliberate ehoice had to be made between several claimants, with all the results in view, and with the full knowledge that posterity would canvass the decision. Why should Rome, or Paris, or Madrid, or Vienna, or London be the capitals of great empires ? Had we now to choose our metropolis, how would Lancashire fight for the Mersey, how loudly would Edinburgh proclaim the grandeur of modern Athens, and Ireland her Atlantic site, her mild climate, her picturesque shores, and her vast harbours ! In almost every other instance the question is settled for us, and as ea^h man pursues the path of his own advancement or ease he unconsciously contributes to solve the grandest political and geographical problems. But this large responsibility, this creation of history to come, which we are thus usually spared, is, in the present instance, thrown upon the QUEEN and her Ministers. They have to find or found a metropolis for British America.
This is not the first time that the British Government has undertaken this task. On the union of the Provinces it selected for this purpose Kingston, the former capital of Upper Canada, on the site of an old military post, and still a flourishing port. Whatever its intrinsic recommendations at that time, they might be supposed greater now. Kingston occupies a central position, at the point between the river and the lake navigations, and sufficicntly convenient for railways. But actual proof is fatal to its pretensions. As the capital of Upper Canada it had been supplanted by its more flourishing rival, Toronto, and as the capital of the united Provinces, though selected by the Imperial Government, it was given up, at the request of the Canadians themselves, for MontreaL The truth is, that Kingston is neither one thing nor the other. It is at the e:tremity of the lakes and at the head of the river, with several great rapids between it and that portion of the St. Lawrence reached by seagoing vessels. We believe it hardly enters into competition. Montreal historically comes next. The Canadians themselves selected it, and it was only given up when a Tory mob destroyed the Houses of the Legislature for passing the " Rebellion Losses Bill." This created a present necessity as well as an important future consideration for housing the Legislature eLsewhere, and, in the absence of any one parount claim, it was made to alternate between Toronto and Quebec. The former of these cities, which was once called New York, till a large proportion of the letters sent there found their way to its Rtepublican namesake, is a very flourishing, well-built city, in the centre of Canadian agriculture, on the low north-west shore of Lake Ontario. On the old principle of taking the most important city, recognizing its natural rank, and elevating it into the mistress of the rest, Toronto would certainly be made the capital of Canada, and probably some day of all British America. But, besides that this importance itself is an objection to Toronto for the capital of a federal combination, it is simply the capital of Upper Canada. It has not a particle of sympathy with Lower Canada, from which it is very distant, and if the Legislature should take much of its colour from thelocality, which is always to be expected, the very peculiar race and very peculiar institutions on the banks of the St. Lawrence would be liable to ro-ugh treatment at the hands of these prosperous new settlers. There is another objection to Toronto. It is now absolutely indefensible, the last pretence of a fort having been wisely swept away. Now, this might not signify the least for a hundred years or more, but we have only to suppose an unsettled state of things either on the American or the British shores of Lake Ontario, and the Mr. WVAlKER of the day might man a steamer overnight with a few cannon and two or three hundred Filibusters, and by daybreoak lay the Canadian capital in ashes. As Englishmen, we have a bad conscience on this point, aud remember certain ill-doings on the Potomac; but, though the retribution might be deserved, that is no reason for courting it, as we conceive we should do by establishing a British Washington on the low shore of a tranquil lake only a few hours' steam from half a dozen American harbours.
Quebec, the old French capital, is a very picturesque city, in a beautiful situation, and on the principle detur pulchriori would carry off the prize. It has the more solid advantages of an impregnable fortress, and a direct communication with England by vessels of a large draught. But Quebec is the capital of Lower Canada in a still more exclusive sense than Toronto is of the Upper Province. Its populat-on are more French than the:French themselves; they have no sympathy with Upper Canadians, and are not likely within any
reasonable time to acquire a larger range of thought and feelings. But the Upper Canadians are the dominant class and must gain the day in the long run, so any attempt to give the weaker and more prejudiced element a fictitious advantage would only protract and embitter the struggle. The climate, too, is the worst in Canada. On the whole, the recommendations of this city are those that appeal to the imagination rather than the reason, and we should pay dear for poetry and sentiment. Quebec must always retain a high degree of importance as the first great city on the St. Lawrence. It will not lose by the lot falling to another city; on the contrary, it will be for the advantage of the French Canadians to be tempted out of their own circle into a more mixed population and a more productive climate. The sooner they coalesce with the more energetic elements continually flowing past them into the interior the better for all, and to fix the Legislature at that particular point where prejudices are the strongest and progress the least would only foster a vain resistance to natural, irresistible, and salutary tendencies. Quebec, then, must be given up, as we think. So, too, for the opposite reason, must another site of a very different character. There is a very strong party for Ottawa, a city that is to be ratiker tha i4 now,
on the river of that name, the chief feeder of the St. Lawrence. It lies on tho iLte of a railway that is to form the direct communicatioi. between Montreal and Lake Superior, avoiding .all the lower lakes, and is the terminus of a shor,' line fromn the St. Lawrence at Ogdensburg. It is a city of no great size, but that is urged as a re,)mmendation, on the American principle of avoiding' as much as possible local power and influences. It is central not only for the river and the lakes, but also for that immense interior north and west of the lasces that may some day be peo, led. But these are remote considerations. We must deal with realities; and, as things now are, the choice of Ottawa would sacrifice the actual convenience of the majority to the ideas of a few.
There remains the city of Montreal, which would probably be the capital at this moment but for the folly of some intemperate politicians, who, being beaten in the Legislature, instigated a mob to burn its House to the ground. Whatever reasons then existed for the choice exist now. Montreal is the most central, certainly not too near Lower Canada, as the above incident shows, for it arose out of the, local ascendancy of Tory or British feeling. It is an old-established city, at the head of the ship navigation of the St. Lawrence, almost equally connected with bsth the Provinces, and easily approached both by the St. Lawrence and the Graud Trunk Railway, either from Toronto or Quebec. It is also some distance from the frontier, and not so completely at the mercy of such a casualty as we have hinted at in the case of Toronto. We are not aware
that anybody seriously apprehends a recurrence' of the olutrage which drove the Legislature away from Montreal, but we should think it in the hig,hest degree unlikely, as it would certainly be fatal to the pretensions as well as to the character of MIontreal. Whether the same evil might be anticipated in a somewhat milder degree, in the form of an influence, or simply an annoyance, is a question for those better acquainted with the city and the people. There can be no doubt of the great convenience of Montreal, and the mere fact of its populace having once burnt out the Legislature need have no more weight against considerations of actual convenience than would the fact of a London mob suddenly burning down our own Houses of Parliament, if it should ever do so. Such, then, is the question that awaits the decision of the British Government. The Canadian Legislature has voted a quarter of a million sterling for the buildings, and has pledged itself to abide by the decision of the QUEEN. It could not have referred to a more impartial umpire, for HEE MAEJSTY'S Ministers will spare no pains to find out what is best for the Canadians. We have thrown the weight of our advice into the scale of Mlontreal, for which we certainly have no special favour or affection, as we happened to take a prominent part in defending the Rebellion Losses Bill, which eventually became law, though at the sacrifice of the building in which that ceremony took place. In Canada, however, there is an immense amount of condonance; all parties have to be forgiven in trn; the rebel of yesterday is the Prime Minister of today, and must not objeoi to building a handsome newParliament-house among repentant incendiaries. If the Canadians themselves can afford to forget that ebullition of feeling, so also can Hxu MAJSTY's Government; and we are sure that, unless better claimants should occur, HIM M&JESTY'S advisers wnM not let this incident interfere with the claims of Montreal.
In a week or two we shall have a new Parlia-
In a week or two we shall have a new Parliament, and one of the first subjects coming before that Parliament for consideration will be that of the Estimates. It is remarkable how much, on the present occasion, will be found to turn. on this always interesting point. Our whole financial policy seems at stake. If we are to get rid of the Income-tax in 1860-if we are to escape the continuance of an impost which everybody admits to be unjust as it stands, and most statesmen declare to be beyond mending-if we are to reserve unimpaired for the hour of emergency a resource which experience has shown to be excellent,-if we are to do all this, then we must needs reduce our expenditure. But from this conclusion foUows another. If we are to reduce our expenditure it must be done mainly in the warlike Estimates, for, although the Miscellaneous Estimates have now come in for their share of scrutiny and cavil, it is in the accounts for the Army and Navy that we must look for the best chances of economi7ing. Our present remarks are directed to the latter of these services-a service universally regarded in so favourable a light that any discussion on the matter assumes a very simple form. There are not two opinions about the expediency of maintaining our position on the sea. Even those who look with disapproval on any expansion of our military armaments are always willing to support the proper demands of our marine, and all questions on this subject amount, in point of fact, to an inquiry whether any proposed outlay or system is or is not conducive to the efficiency of the British Navy. If it is, there is an end of the debate-the money will undoubtedly be found.
We now ask the attention of the public to a point of very considerable importance in connexion with the Navy and its Estimates. This very morning a ship of famous name, gigantic proportions, and most formidable batteries will be paid off at Portsmouth-being no less a vessel than the Duke of Wellington. Supposing, now, that a comparison were instituted between the cost of this ship during the time she has been in commission and the services which she has rendered in the same period, what would be the apparent results ? Of course, we are not in any way questioning the energy, skill, seamanship, or any other qualifications of the officers or men who may have been employed in her, or, indeed, her own particular qualities as a vessel of her own rate. No doubt she is as good a screw-propelled 131 gun ship as could be built; it is her class that we are considering, and the utility of such a class compared with its cost. One of these enormous vessels, over and above the first charge of construction, requires 1,000 men as her complement, consumes vast quantities of coal, and demands most expensive pronision for the wear and tear of her engines and the repair of her prodigious hull. Now, what service can she perform in return for locking up seamen enough to man a whole squadron of gunboats or cruisers, and entailing all this costly and multiplied outlay? As it seems, Ecarcely any. Her batteries, perhaps, are powerful enough to go alongside fortifications of stonethough that point is hardly yet settled,-but she draws so much water that she has not a chance of getting near the object of attack ; for the same reason, every craft lighter than herself, or, in other words, every craft afloat, can escape her, except in mid-ocean, and the end of it is that sbe finds no opportunity of action whatever. Yet we still go on constructing these tremendous vessels, and not we only, but other nations too, for it was only yesterday that we reported the launch of a 100-gun screw line-of-battle ship at Rochefort with great pomp and ceremony. Is this system a sound one?
If the answer to this important question is not absolutely certain, it is at any rate very obvious. All vepels have their use in a powerful marine.
The use of a line-of-baidt sbip is not to run up creeks, to go into shal.o30ws, or even, under ordinary circumstances, ta chase an enemy, nor is it any disparagement to her qualities to say that if tried upon such dnties 6he would be found wanting. Her use, as her designation implies, is to take a place in the line df naval battle; if there is no such battle she is not i)rought into action; but this very fact implies that her adversaries are scared off the ocean, and that she is mistress of the sea. This is precisely what took place in the late war. As Russia declined to meet the allies afloat, their line-of-battle ships could only keep the sea; but this they did, and it is owing to their presence and attitude that the fleets of the Cz.u, instead of cruising about the Channel or the Mediterranean, were moored harmlessly behind the batteries of Cronstadt and Sebastorol. The war, therefore, on the side of tlhe allies, became purely an offensive one. As there was no naval engagement we wanted no naval battalions; but to argue on this account that naval battalions are useless would be something like putting down infantry as an arm of the military service because it was not required at Khooshab. As to the mere inaction of the Duke of WVellington, compared with her cost, that point is very. Bdon disposed o£ She and her lirench consorts were sent out to give a good account of the Russian fleet, aud they did so. They extinguished it for the whole time of the war as completely as if it had never existed, and if they did this without the loss of a man or the cost of a charge of powder, so much the better. A zanguinary battle would have only added blood and money to our outlay, and could have done no more, after all.
We may assume, then, with confidence, that so long as regular naval battles are to be anticipated, ships of the line must be found to fight tl em ; and in this case the stronger each ship is the more powerful, of course, will be the aggregate fleet or squadron. A dozen 120's would certainly beat a dozen 74's. It may, perhaps, however, occur to some persons to doubt whether encounters of this kind are likcely to be repeated-whether a squadron of this or that nation will find a squadronof the enemydrawnup in regular oiler of battle and prepared to fight it out. TheAmericans certaiuly do not seem to be taking this view of things, though they keep a vigilant eye upon all naval matters. Instead of providing themselves w'th a line of three-deckers, they have built a few frigates of extraordinary armament and. geat swiftness, and, if a vessel like the Niagara should really be found to answer, it is expec,ed that %he will keep out of reach of a line-of-baitle ship and hammer at her from a safe distance with her prodigious guns. Now, what becomes of iLe old doctrine of "keeping the seas" if a score or two of frigates, evading, defying, or even annoying a great fleet of first and second-rates, should prowl about the ocean at will, while their porderous adversaries were drawn up somewhere in scientific "line of battle" without an enemy ever likely to come into sight ? To this it may be replied, that we certainly ought to possess Niagaras, just as we ought to have Teasers and Crackers and all sorts of craft, but that this cannot aid us in dispensing with our lne of battle, for of what avail would be our frigates and corvettes if a powerful fleet of the enemy, brushing away such hornets, were to sail straight for the Thames or the Mersey ? On the whole, we do not think that a nation aspiring to the maintenance of such a position as ours can ever permit its line-of-battle ships to fall short of tle highest known standard of strength. It is true enough that we may more frequently have occasion for vessels of a less powerfulbutmore managea'be class, just as we are now sending light 3-pounders to China instead of our heavy field artillery; but the real power of a navy in anything like a naval struggle must depend upon the line of battle it can show. As there has been no naval struggle of late tbere has been no demand upon our Dukes of Wellington, and if the mastery can always be maintained by the mere appeararce of such strength, without the necessity of employing it, we could hardly ask for a more desirable reault.
The arrival of the Simla at Marseilles presents
The arrival of the Simla at Marseilles presents us with a practicza solution of the Australian difficulty. She brings dates from Sydney of Feb-uary 11, from Melbourne of February 15, from the Mauritius of March 1, and from Suez of March 26. It may be remembered that not long since a controversy arose as to the readiest means of communication with our Australian Colonies, but, when once it was determined that the route should be by the Red Sca, the d;spute resolved itself into one upon a mere matter of detail. Some persons were in favour of the route by the Mauritius, whch has been the one actually preferred; others argued in favour of a somewhat more direct line, which was to strike upon certain islets marked upon the charts as the Seychelles. Other matters remaining equal, there might probably be a gain upon the latter route of twenty-four hours. On the other hand, certain incidents of navigation, and peculiar circunr4tauces connected with the approach to the Seylielles, seemed to male in favour of the route by the Mauritius. Added to this, at the Maiuitius there were docks and means of repair in case of accident forthcoming, all of which must neeessarily have been created at the Seychelles. The determination to adopt the route by the Mauritius in the first instance was, no doubt, a wise one, although when the traffic is more firmly settled a saving of twenty-four hours may become a matter worthy of further attention. On the result already attained we congratulate the public, and in especial the mercantile community. Nothing could have been more injurious to the operations of trade than the extreme uncertairty which has too long characterized our communieations with our Australian Colonies. Had there simply been tediousness and delay, so long as the delay and the tediousness were of regular occurrence the inconvenience, deplorable enough in all cases, might have been borne; but, with dates varying from three months and a half to two months, it was well-nigh impossible to use forecast for the future. This question, which seems now to have received its solution, is of far more real importanco than almost any other question of route which is now before the public. Our Australian Colonists have always been, and will continue to be in a still higher degree, consumers of British manufactures; and they have in the precious metals, and in their olther articles of export, returns which are of the utmost consequence to us. But 'we must have as regular means of communication with Sydney as with New York. Our merchants must acquire the srtisfactory conviction that they are not venturing their fortunes on a mere hazard when they engage in Australian operations, or else the trade will fall into the hands of mere speculators; Regularity, and then speed, are the necessary conditions of eommercial intercourse. When complete arrangements are made, and the full power of ocean steamers. is developed between Suez and Sydney, we trust to see the limits of time as between us and the Antipodes still further narrowed. Is it a dream to suppose that ten years hence a man may be standing one day in London, and in forty days afterwards transacting business at our Antipodes ? The first step, at any rate, is taken in the matter. T'he arrival of the Simla at Suez on the 26th of Mah opens a new era in tho chronicq1v of Au a,

The steamer Tennessee arrived from AspinwaU with news from Nicaragua, New Granada, Venezuela, and the South Pacific. The accounts were not so favourable as the Tennessee had been in the habit of bringing. Walker was at Rivas, but it is reported that there was much disaffection among his men. Sir Robert Maclure had visited him and also several American offlcers. Colonel Lockridge had failed to take Castillo Fort in consequence of the cowardice of Colonel Titus, formerly of Kansas, and. was waiting further reinforcements. An important correspondence of General MIora had been intercepted. The news is interesting in its details, but but not of particular importance.
No decisive movement had been made by either side. All sorts of rmnours were rife at Panama relative to the position of affairs between the New Granadiau Government and the United States. A report prevailed that our Minister, MIr. Bowling, and MIr.

The Kidderminster Election Riots.
THIE KIDDEBAIrNSTER ELEcTIOw RIOTS.
This theID RINSEP F5iaDAY.
This being the day appointed for the final examination of the smen, John Cooke and John Hayes, charged with being concerned in the riotous proceedings at Kidderminster after the close of the eleotion on Saturday night, and it being understood that a number of others who had been concerned in the actual outrage upon Mr. Lowe would be brought up, some excitement was occasioned in the town. It will be remembered that Cooke and Hayes were apprehended (as stated in ne Times of Tuesday) for assautinig the pohoe and refusing to disperse after the Riot Act had boon read on Saturday night. The magistrates before whom the
,risoners wero brought to-day were-the Mayor (Mr. Kiteley), and Messrs. George, Turton, G. Hoomnan, H. Talbot, W. Grosvenor, and W. NichoUs. On the aUplica. tion of Mr. Best, 'who conducted the prosecution, Cooke and Hayes were further remanded till Monday, when a charge of rioting is to be preferred against them.
There were some 10 or a dozen summonses issued against persons for breaohes of the poe on Friday night. The first case called was that of Thomas Youngjohn, charged with assaulting Police-constable Edw ards.
Edwards stated that he was on duty in Swan-street on Fridaynight, betweon 11 and 12 o'clock. The prisoner was using bad language there, and said, " PoU the b- house down" (meaning the Swan Hotel), and "have tho b- out," &c. The prisoner threw a brick at him, and knocked off his hat. He took him into custody. He resisted, and the policeman was knooked down, kicked, aud pelted with stones. With the help of another pollceman he managed to beat back the people several times amid a shower of stones.
On the application of Mr. Best this prisoner was also romnanded till londay next on giving bail.
The next case called on was one arising out of the riot on Saturday night, after the poll had been declared, wherein John Bennett, foundryman, was charged as a defendant. The prosecator is Mr. Broom, a worsted-spinner, living at Stourport.
Mr. Broom stated that he was at the pollingbooth at Blakebrook on Saturday evening. When leavinrg the booth, shortly after 4 o'clock, with Mr. Lowe and his friende, and proceeding towards the grammar school kept by Mr. Sheppard, he was struck with a stone, and also kicked savagely from behind. He was unable to identify the person who struck him. He succeeded in gain. Ing access, wvith Mr. Lowve, to MIr. Sheppard's, when he wras struck again by another person who was standing on a wall
A& witness named Hammond deposed to seeing Bennett kick Mr. Broom.
John Hargrave also gave similar testimony as to blows being struck by Bennett.
On the application of Mr. Best, who stated that he should be able to produce evidence showing that the prieoner Was one of a number of persons who were rioting afte the election, the case was adjourned til Monday.
John Llewellin, weaver, was next charged with assaulting Police-constable Edwards while in the execution of his duty.
Edwards stated that there were between 300 and 400 persons assembled opposite the Swan about 3 o'clook on Saturday morning. The prisoner was foremost among them, and was encouraging the mob to attack the Swan. The windows were broken, and the doors forced in. The prisoner used very bad and threatening languaue, and oflered to fight the offleer. Some of the persons got Into tho Swan and frightened the inmates very mucb.
This man was also remanded tiU Monday.
Charles Partridge was charged with riotously assembling in the streets of the town on lbriday night, and breaking the windows at the Swan. He, too, was remanded.
The last defendant was George Gough, a young man, apparently in the situation of a clerk, aud decently attired, w o was charged with breaking windows at the Swan by throwing penny-pieces, several of which were afterwards picked up in the house. This defendant was in the foremost ranks of the crowd, and was seen to throw the moneyp. Be admitted the charge, but palliated it by saying that he had not thrown stones. He was fined Is. and costs, and discharged.
The polioce have their eyes on some of the ringleaders of the mob at the hustings, -who it is expected will be brought up on Monday.

PARIS, APREi 2, 6 P.L
There was no meeting of the NeuchatelConferenoe to-day, and it is not certain that there will be one to-morrow. It is difficult to ascertain how the m%tter is really getting on; I doubt whether the Plenipotentiaries themselves can say anything positive about it. The demands of Prusiaunder discussion yesterday are said to be these-a full aud complete amnesty for those 'who took part in the insurrection of September; conservation of the title of the Prince of ?Neuchitel; payment to the King by the Elelvetic Confederation of two millions as a compensation for the revenues of Neuchatel; restitution of the property of the Church incorporated in the year 1848 with the property of the State; payment by the Helvetic Confederation of the expenses occasionedby the events of Septemlber, and by the occupation; contribution by the population to the expenses at the charge of the State; an amnesty for all political offences previouS to the events of September; a guarantee by the State for the capital and interest of pious establishmenpt
hospitals, &c., particularly of the sum bequeathed by the Baron de Gury; and suspension of all discussion relative to the constitution of Neuchatel until after the expiration of a term of siX months. Such, I am given to understand, are the conditions on which the King of Prussia will renounce his claim to the sovereignty. They are rather hard, Co1sidering that up to a very recent date the Swiss demanded the pure and simple renunciation- butbard as they may be, I suppose they will have no alternative but to accept them, with perhaps xome little modification.
M. Besson, holding the rank of LieutenantColonel on the Staff, who had been sent on a mission to the Danubian Provinces to make the surveys necessary for fixing the boundaries, has, by an order of the Minister of War dated yesterday, been relieved of his duties as commissioner, and ordered to return to Paris to resume his place on the Staff.
A letter from Constantinople mentions that the French Ambassador has interfered in a friendly but not official manner in the affair of the Kangaroo, and that through his mediation, aided by oth'r members of the diplomatic corps, the affair will, in aUl likelihood, be arranged.
On the occasion of the recent negotiations carried on between Lord Cowley and Feruk Khan the Queen of England commanded that a gold enuff box, enriched with diamonds, should be presented to M. de Biberstein Kazimirskl, Secretary Intervreter attached to the French Miniiiistry of Foreign Ain. This magnificent present was accompanied by a highly complimentary letter to that gentleman from the English Ambassador in Paris.
There was a full meeting of the Council of State yesterday on the business of the Bishop of Mouhns (PM. de Dreux Brez6); the Minister of Public 1nstruction was present. The discussion was very warm, and the minority in favour of the Bishop, though small, was rather violent. One member, Mvi. Corundet, declared that the conduct pursued towards the Bishop was unjust and impolific, and he feared might tend to alienate the clergy from the Government. The Republican, or rather exRepublican, M. de Cormenin, the once celebrated " Timon" of the Orateurs, spoke pretty much in the same sense. The Council met again to-day, but I have not heard with what result.

AUSTRIA.
(FOM OUR OWN cORRE8PsroxNm.)
V ENNA, &L&UnCI 31.
Yesterday, at noon, the Marquis de Cantono called on the Austrian Minister for Foreign Afairs, and officially informed him that he had received his letters of recall. As has already been said, the Sardinian diplomatist will remain here for some days, but it must be well lmderstood that for the. moment there is no hope of a reconciliation between the Vienna and Turin Cabinets. As soon as M. de Cantono has put his private affairs in order he will leave for Turin.
The principal topic of conversation here is the appointment of Count Francis Zichy to be Grand Master of the Household to the new GovernorGeneral of the Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom. The Count, who is a member of the Council of the Empire, and Vice-President of the Credit Bank and of the Lombardo-Venetian Railroad Company, is said to have declared that he was unequal to the duties of such an important post, but, as His Majesty would listen to no excuse, the Hungarian noble was fain to accept the proffered honour. Count Francis Zichy, -who is a man of great talent and acquirements, will doubtless be able to render excellent service to the youthful and inexperienced Archduke; but it is certain that he would much rather remain here than go to the LombardoVenetian Kingdom. As a member of the Counoil of the Empire, M, do Zichy receives a salary of 8,000 IL; as Vice-President of the Credit Bank, 12,000fl.; and as Vice-President of the Board of the Lombardo-Venetian Railroad, some 6,000fl. or 8,000 1. The Grand Masters of the Household to the Imperial Princes only receive 3,000 fl. each, but folrtmately the newly appointed dignitary is in possession of a very handsome private fortune. Since the Emperor has been back from Italy the question of enlarging the inner city has been seriously entertained; but His Majesty will hardly permit the ramparts to be razed. There is such a dearth of lodgings and shops in Vienna that the proprietors of the houses demand and obtain the most exorbitant rents, and no change for the better Iis likely to take place until the walls which separate
the city from the suburbs have been removed. For many long years the building a new Buog (Palace) Theatre and a new Opera-houee has been '-Iked of, and it has at length been determined th,m the matter shall be taken in hand without delay. The Vienna ladies, who have been acustomed from their early youth to the narrow passages and staircases of the Birg Theatre, never seem to fancy that they are in danger when seated in their boxes, but architects have frequently told me that if a fire should ever break outwhile the performances are going on two-thirds of the audience must be lost. If the door of a box is wide open there is not room for a person to pas between it and the wall of the passage or corridor, and in the passages which lead from the cloak-rooms to the lobby threo porsons cannot walk abreast. The rumour that the police will soon be placed under the Minister of the Interior again prevails, and it has not escaped my attention that the persons who seem to take mnost interest in the matter belong to the Ultramontane party. As you learnt by my letter of yesterday, the Austrian press is now under very strict surveillance, but if ever it should be placed under the sole direction of the Home Department it will be a certain proof that a clerical, or rather a Jesuitical, censorship is about to be established. The Ultramontane party daily gains ground in Europe.
The Papal Government has made some changes, not improvements, in ita passport system. A Roman subject who 'wishes to travel abroad must pay los. ior his passport, and an extra foe for the visa. A foreigner pays l1. a-year for his carkede sgijour; 2Z. for permission to travel for six months in the domains of the Church * and iL 10.. a-year for permission to carry prohitited armLs The foregoing information is probably perfectly correct, but, if not so, the fault lies with the Roman correspondent'of tIe Aug3buWg (JtxeUe and not with me.
It is said in weu-infoxmed circles that FieldMarshal Baron Hess in no longer so much In favoiur at C6urt as he was a short time ago, and the reaon given for the decline of his infiluence i, thit he is averse to a plan which has been drawn up for etaabUhhing a chain of fortifications fom Oracow in th9
Weft to some point near Czernowitz (in the Bikg. vina) in the EiAt. Some detached forts are aboat to be consructed near Cracow, ind 'when they are completed the fortress of Cracow will be one of the strongest in the empire. There is reason to believe that the Vienna-Triesto ailroad-will at no distant period pass intoTthe hands of theLombardo-Venetia
Iariroad Company. The price .demanded for lt y Government is said to be 70,000,000f.

A letter fiom Turin, of the 31st ult., says that the agitation observable among the population of Venice gives considerable uneasiness to the civil and military authorities. The disappearance of a boat laden with gunpowder is' spoken of, and various domiciliary viits have taken place.
A letter from Palermo, of the 26thult. announces the arrival there of the Duke of Serra di Falco. The King had granted him leave to return to his country-a favour he had long solicited. The Government still detaiuns in prison the, relatives of those who have fledL The political prisoners in the prisons of Cefall are said to undergo great suffer.
-letter fromVenice,of the.25th, contains further detils of the popular movement which took place in. that city on the waniversary of the 22dof Mirch, which for the last few years had passed bver without any demonstration. On the afiternon of that memorable anniversary the theatre was filled with ldes in full drews, holding in their hands bouquets composed of red, green, and white flowers. The ,Simon Boccanegra of Verdi wa given, and the celebrated ballet of Bianchi a Beri. At the rAoment when the negroes in the ballet burst, their chains and the slav kills his master there was one i universal shout carried to the highest pitche Even
the ladies applauded. This demonstration was so expresaive that a repetition of the ballet was forbidden. During the same afternoon an enormous tricoloured balloon was en hovering- over the quay Degli Schiavoni- The- wls -were covered with placards, with "Italr for ever 1" "Cavour, Prime Miister of Italy, for ever l" " Emmanuel, King of Italy, for ever 1" The writer of the letter adds that it would be difficult to describe the effect produced on the populace by the sight of the national flag hoisted on the flagstaff. For two days the excitement -was so great as to call to mind the period which preceded the Revolution of 1848. Such was the state of public feeling when the Archduke Maximilian arrived. He had no corUge to follow him, nor any crowd of spectators to cheer him. Silence appeared to be the order of the day, and it was strictly observed. At night the boxes of the theatre were crowded with officials: the pit was nearly empty. When the Imperial hymn was sung there was the usual applause. His Highness was accompanied by Count Wadic and by Signor Bembo, a Venetian, lately appointed Chamberlain. A more audacious set than that of hoisting the tri¢oloured flag was committed on the 26th. The powder magazine of Quinta Valle was entered by meana of false keys, and a quantity of gunpowder sufficient to fill a large boat was abstracted. On the 23d cartridges were distributed to the troops, and cannon were placed in the batteries, so as to command the city.
Extraordinary Case.
BXTRAORDINARY CASE.
For the last few days the publio of Glasgow hava been deeply moved by the report that s gentleman had been poisoned by his sweetheart, the daughter of a highly respect. able family which moves in the better clases of society. These rumours obtained embodiment and confirmation when iB b-4ame known that the young lady had actually been apprehended at the instance of the Public Prosecutor, and that she is at this moment in the prlson of Glasgow on the charge of suspected poisoning. As there Is no public coroner's inquest in Scotland, the real facts connected with a case of this klud are difficult to be had; but it is beEeved flat the following recital is authentic so far as it goes :-It appears that on Monday, the 23d of March bst, a young Pronch Protestant gentleman, named AL Pierre Emile IL'Angeer, who is connetead with the house of 'Messrs. W. B. Huggis, extensive foreign merchants in Glasgow, died. suddenly in his lodgings in the city. From circumstances which came to their knowledge, the firm we have named, on their own
responsiouLiy, requessew liz. seven, who had been in ittendance ipon the deceased bafore his death, and Dr. Thomson, to make a pose mortemr examination. This was done, bet nothing palpably extraordinary was discovered. The stomach and its contents, however, were socuned and retained by the medical gentlemen. The case having been reported to the sheriffs' fiscaL, after inquiring into the circumstances of, the case, they transmittedthe stomach ana its contents to ono of our most eminent local chymists for chymical analysis. The result of the analysis was the discovery in the stomach anlvisceraof a considerable quantityof irritant poison As thero Was nothing to lead to the inference that M. IAngelier had himself thus violently terminated his existence, an inquiry of a searching character was insti. tuted. It appears that the deceased had been on a short
visit to the Bridge of AUlan (a fashionable watering place, 1 about 35 miles from Glasgow), from which he returned rather unoxpeotedly on the night of Sunday, the 22d nlt.,
and, leaving his lodgings abont 8 o'clock, he took thol key with him, stating he wouald be somewhat later than usual. He did return about 2 o'clock on Monday morning, and was then suffering great pain, in consoquence of which a modical gentlleman (Dr. Steven) was called in, who pre. scribed for him without having the most distant notion that hewassaffering from the effects of acrid poison. During the night we learn that the young man was from time to time attended by his landlady, and was often convulsed with agony. He became more quiet towards the morning, and wasleft undisturbed; but when the doctor again called on the forenoon of Monday it was found that his patient was no more. That he was proved to have died from the effee's of polson has been already stated. In the course of the investigation which followed it came out, from oral testimjony as wilU as from the presonee of a vast number of letters, that L'Angelier was on terms of close intimacy with Miss Madeleine Smith, the daughter of a highly respectable architeet residing in Blythwood-square, and there is reason to believe that he left the Bridge of Allan in consequence of a letter addressed to him by the lady expressing a very strong desire to meet him. Whether or not the parties reaUly did or did not meet on that Sunday night is rot yet publicly known; but, in resorting to the extreme stop of apprehending Miss Smith, the authorities no doubt acted on the fact, which is not disputed, that on more than one occasion, the lady, who is cnly 21 years of age, procured arsenic during the month of March at the shops of more than one of the Glasgow WestEnd chymists. The possession of this poison, how ever, Is compatible with entire innocence, for it is known that arsenic is occasionally used by young ladies as a cosmetic. The thought that a highly and
irtuonsdy bred young lady could destroy herlover is too appaling for belief; but the public voioe supplies a reason in the circumstance that a gentleman in a much more promising and prominent position in life than that occupied by LAngelier had become a suitor for the young lady's hand, and that he had been accepted by her and her parents. This we set down as the rumour of the day. Meanwhile, though the young lady is in the hands of justice, there is nothing In her procecdings so far as known, incompatible with innocence. She was judicially examined at great length on Tuesday last, before committal to prison, and comported herself throughout with perfect calmness. The prisoner is granddaughter of the late Mr. David Hamilton the celebrated architect of Glasgow Exchange and Hamilton
Palace. ___ _ _ _ _ ___

The Austrians And Pictures In Churches At Venice.
THE A USTBrZAS AND PICrURES LV OICHVBHnS
AT VENICE.
TO THE 1DITOB OF THZE TIMES.
Sir,-In your impression of Mondaylast your Paris correspondent states that the Austrian Government wished to have the masterpieces of Art which adorn the churches at Venice removed to the Royal and Imperial Academy. The manner in which the fact is stated may lead to the impres. sion that this is an arbitrary measure strongly resenabling legalized spoliation; es *ally as it is much the fashion just now to represent thea.cts of tho Austrian Government in Italy in an odious light. Having reeently spent 12 montbsindifferentcitiesof thelLombardo-Venetian 4-dom and bad ample opportunities of getting at the real opinions and seutiments of all classes of the Austrian Government's Italian subjects, Iam in a postion to positively contradict much that is daily published under the head of "lAustria
mihrule." However, to eonfne myself to tho subject of pictures, I can assure you that all the intelligent Italians I met with who took any interest in Art expressed their wish that the Government would take such a measure as that you refer to, because few of the pictures are so placed in the churches as to be well seen, and, owin to the igoraneo and avarice of the priests, they are alowed to fall into decay. In many of the churehes the dampness of the walls has so mildewoed the pictures that they are scarcely discernible. In some the paint is peeling from the canvas; in others it is grilled bythoheat o 'tapers kept burning at a shrine beneath. The ecclesiastics will ntgo to the leastexpense to have even the most valuable pictures lined, washed, or varnished, and all who have visited the Italian churches must have been strack by the had condition of works to whichbooks upon Art have given a world-wiide celebrity. When Count Cicogwnararescued the famous "Assunta" of Titian from the church r,f tl,n 1'..
at vemce, giving the priests a copy in remunertfon, he rendered an immense service to Art by enabling all who vist the Royal and Imperial Academy to study and admire its beauties. They were so completely concealed by smoke, mildew, and other filth, when the picture was removed from the Frati, that their reverenoes thought they got an escellent bargain in tho modem pictures which Count Cicognara gave them in exchange for Titian's masterpiece The Italians woidldnotfeel aieved at the removal of the works of the great masters to i pubio galler where they would be 8een and taken cae of, as many artiss hive told me they had uged inch a measure on the authorities, and regretted that their recommendation had led to no reslt.

A3ticsjbhoderiVe a zpecunlar benefit from the small contributions of. strangers who fee the Cioerone, generally an ignorammusof the class of those who In former days used to conduct visitors tlirongh Hanpton Court PaLace.

Tbo officers and lsl(gngto the corps of Royal. Engineers at Chatham garrion, upwurds of l,000 men, were ysterdayafternoon engaed ina s of tge operations of ia new and hibly interesting chraeer, in the presenc Of
ajor-GeueralT,BlaSard, O.B., BoyAl Engineers, ind a large number of engneer and other oMfoices. The experi.
nentns were undertaken with the view of intrcting the troops belonging to that branch of the service in excavating, sapping, and making regular approaches to a fortified position, soas to eiable the regular troops to attack it with succeas,
The offioers ard mene having assembled on the parade. ground at Brompton Barracks shortly before 2 o'clock were teparated into several divisions, including an attacking party, commanded by Lieutenant G. Philips ; a party to defend the position, in charge of Lieutenant S. G. Bird, with working and lodgment parties, each in charge of an officer of
.he Royal Engineers. The troops comprising the attack *Fere formed into partieS to make the neoessry excavations, others to occupy the batteries, and another body to act s a covering party, the direction of thewhole plan of opera-
ionsbeing intrusted to Major FC. Raard, tR.B., under t>he general irection of Colonel H. Sanha.
As soon as each division had been told offthe entire hody mnarched to the field-works at the rear of Brompton Barracks, where the siege operations wee to take pac, The pan of operations consisted in the attk and defenee of those portions of the line of fortifications which suiround Chatham Garrison known as the Rayelin and Camberland Bastion. For some days previous to the operations strong working parties of the Sappers nd Miner had been engogea in the excavation of adouble Sap aginst the face of the P-veln, and on the arrival of the troops on the ground one portion of the Attacking party ws plad at the bead of the sap, where -a quantity of excavating toolhadalgso beencollected. Excavations had also been mude for the purpose of odging 10 " fougAseeP of gunpowder, in Cib. charges, at a depth of fourfeet below thesfwoe, and axfeet apart. The troops engaged in the atak and defence were each supplied with 15 rounds of blank cartridge.
On the several partiogarriving on the ground the men coinpoing the attack wereo conealed bebind the earthworha which had been, previously thrown up, after wiich preparations were made for exploding the "fougaues" by mieans of the voltaic battery, under the direction of Cap. tai C. E. Cauberland, l.E.. The charges Were placed abont 30 feet in front of the crest of the counter tcarp of the left fac of the agazine Ravelin, and on being fired the effect was very grand, the earthwork boing thrown to a distance of nearly 50 feet into the air. ImmediatelT after the explosion had taken place the men sttioned In the double sap moved out, each provided with the necessary working tools, forthepurposeof forming a trench 10 feet wido and three deep on the spot where the explodion had just taken place. In advance of the Working paty were thrown out a number of troops protected from head to foot by Ge(neral Blanhard's iron mnatletg, wbich each man carried. Under their protection the men re enabled to push on in front of worbding parties, the inantlets reisting the effect of an enemy's fire. The troops stationed within the portion of the works attacked opened a quick fire on the working parties, the latter of *hom quicldy constructed their pbions, during which they were protected by a fring paty, who kept up a heay fiea. Tae working party continued the excavation of the trench' which in a very short time was excavated to a length of several hundred yards. Unfortunately during the latter part of the operations a heavy storm of rain aot in, which prevented the entire arrangements intended being carried oat.
The siege operations were performed by the troops engaged in an efficient manner, and refected very great credit Qn Major Eassaid, by Whom they Were superintended.
Yesterday the 7th company of Royal Engineers, under tho commrand of Captain R. Warren and Lieutenant D. G. W. Moncrieff, R.E., arrived at their head-quarters, Brompton Barracks, Chatham, from Plymouth, where theylwere stationed for some time, for the purpose of performing the various engineering operations required by Government. The 23d company of Royal Engineers, under the commnand of Captain A. R. Clarke, will embark on board the Admiral for Hongkong.

And I believe, for myv part that in speaking the trth, as we hold it, of aCbd sovereign, 'we are paying no disrespect at all toa good one. (Cheers.) Far fromn it. On the contrary, 'we degrade our own honour and the Sovereign's by unduly and unjustly praising him ; an, the ere lauverer and flatterer is one 'who comeru foward, as it 'were, with flash-notes, and pays with false coin his tribute to rdesar.

And, belongig to he, mry Ya thies andr m deses are vith them. If it hap. pened that whe'were a here anassembly ofnoblemen and earls, we should no doubt form a Viscounts' Government,

If I, for example, 'were the noble lord 'who occupied a high position at home, andI especially if I should possibly have a relative. in afar distant land 'where the war 'was going on, I should, most undoubtedly and mogt justifiably write out to those iux

(Long continued cheers.)
Mr. STUIG, M.P., in proposig "the Scotch Universities," remarked that they could not boast the great endowments, or the great patronage, or the political consideration which their sister universities in England and Ireland possessed; they had bad the privilege sometimes of educating men like the harquis of Iansdowne, Lord Pal. merston, or Lord John Russell, but they never had th
chance of sending them to Parliament. (Heiar, hear.) r
Professor BLAc=E returned thanks, wishing rather that this duty had fallen on him 30 or 40 years ago, as he could tben have spoken of the Scotch as the best educated people in the world, language wvhichcould ulow scarcely be venturei upon even in a Wigtown or a Caithness Presbytery. With the single exception of the Medical Faculty, representedhere by thebreadthandmaiestYofthelearnedprofessor(Simpson), whom a recent poet had described as uniting the front of Bacchus with the head of JoTe (laug1'ter), the Scotch universities did not stand where every true Scotch. man would desire them to stand. They had starved their schools so nmuch that the punils were but half.educated, and the consequence was that-the professors had to expend their strength on drilling raw, miserable boys in their elementary lessons instead of leading them into the inner shrines and the penetralia of science. He hoped the new Parliament would not sepaate. without doing something to place the Scottish universities on a higher platform than that on which thev had hitherto stood (Applause.)
The Rev. Dr. HArsA, in giving "En3;glish Literaturei," observedthat, as a clergymnan, ne had the greatest pleasure in joining with his fellow-townsmen in the present tribute of admiration for the talent of Mr. Thackeray, and in the expression of gratitude for the many hours of exquisite enjoyment which they had had in the perusal of his writing. Ie would even VentUre, on the part of his profesaion
to claim M. Thacleray as an ally, andto thank him for the great service which he had renderedin the cause which was common to them all-of preading among their eoutrvien all kind, and gentle, and .h and pure, and Chirst;a

rerfeotly certain that there is a certain Francis Grant ia London who could paint a picture as well as any Scotchman out of London, or any man in almost any other country. I know that one of our chief painters-one of our naturalistio school-comes to draw his inspiration from Scotland, and that he finds his most noble rocks, his most beautiful lakes, his most splendid deer, and his most wonderful heather here, I know that a week ago I shook hands with a young painter, a leader of tho Young England school in Perth, and that helastyearfound his autumna leaves, and his beautiful grass, and his glorious sunset, worthy of Giorgione himself, by the banks of the Tay. I knowr the young Queen of the French naturalistic school came into your country, and has faUen in love with it, and has taken away from it a little ark of her own, carrying 'with her many of your animals. (Cheers) I cannot say what particular powor it may be in your coontry which creates this immense attachment but I begin, I aEsure you, to feel it myself. (Cheers.) What vitality is it in the air which causes all you Scotchmaen to have such an intense nationality? Not that your artists cannot go to other places than to Scotland. Yesterday, in the course of one of those visits of which I spoke to the Royal Academy's Exhibition, I was taken by Lauder into the sacred garden of Olivet. I wandered also with Harvey back into old times, and saw dear old John Bunyan standing at the gate of Bedford Gaol. I passed a little door, and there I was away from John Bunyan, but Harvey was carrying me on still, and I stood on thodeck of Columbus's caravel, and we looked out and saw land across the Atlantic. Then I went with Noel Paton, who led me on to the moonlit regions of fairyland, and looked at the beautiful crowds of creatures that danced, and frsked, and gambolled around Oberon and the beautiful Titania. Thea he brought me away from that fairy plate into a place stM more pleasant-from fairy land into love land-and I be-
eld a young couple sitting in uncommonly olose conversation under the gleams of Hesperus, that bright star, who I am sure would wink at what that couple wrere going to do next. (Laughter.) And I thought to myself how delightful, and how calm, and how pleasant, and how superior is your calling and your business-the mistress you worship-to the noise, and the turmoil, and the struggle, and the excitement which bave been going on all over Scotland-except inyour studios and in your gaeries-to that immense noise and bustle of elections, which, I am sure, Mr. Cowan is very glad to think is over. (Laughter.) Your mistress is always young. It does not matter to you what dark conspirators are attempting to oust Mr. Cowan from his seat. (Much laughter and cheering.) I have heard of several. Yourcity is stand. ing there, calm and great, and bright, and beautiful - the great Castle looks down the great street that leads to holyreod; and Arthuts Seat is enveloped in mist, or is covered with cloud, or is golden with sunshine. What matters who is elected at LeithJ and whether Mr. Miller or whether the Lord-Advocate triumphs there? The -waves, as before, come rolling into the Firth from the sea, What matters it at Aberdeen whether Colonel Sykes or Mr. Leith is elected? The great, calm, old gray city of Aberdeen, and its University, with its crowned towers, still sits camly on the sands, and looks towards the ocean; the Don rnshes by Seaton Woods, and under the slim arch of the old bridge, away towards the sea. (Cheers.) As I was musing upon the vast superiority of your calling over other callings, I was met by a couple of friends of mine-politicians, ia this city-and I heard these gentlemen engaged in the deepest consultations about tfe last return from the Looblin burghs, or about John o'Groat's House, or about who was to be the member for the Orlcaeys. (Laughter.) And passing away from their conversation, I thought I would go into your Gallery, and there, to my surprise, I found that the painters had been working, and had been candidates for public applause too. The landscape painters had been at their work, and, as I looked round, I saw that Ferragon in Perthshire wore Earvey's colonrs in spite of the Act (laughter and cheers); that Locha]ine Castle, and Inverlochy Castle, and Irvine Mill were admirably represented by MoCulloch (cheers); that Arran from the large Cumbrae had been most triumphantly canvassed by lilne Donald (cheers), and that though lNward Ellice may certainly sit for St. Andrew's in the next Parliament, D. . Eill has achieved a rauch greater triumph, and made St. Andrew's sit for him. (Laughter and prolonged cheering.)
The other toasts were :-"the Chairman, " by Mr. Stirling "the Drama," by Mr. R. Chambers, to which Mr. James Russell replied; "the Press," by Professor George Wilson for which Mr. Watson, of the Courant, briefly returned thanks; and "the Croupier," by Mr. Cowan, M.P.

"LA P1TATA.-CflLTS1TON.
%,Beforc Dr. Lusrn1NGTOX.)
The brig Helene, of the burden of 1900 tons, and the screw steamship La Plata, of the burden of 428 tons, came into contaot witb each other off the Brunswick-pier, BlackwalJ, at 10 15 on the 10bh of October last. The wind was very light from S. to S.W., and the weather was very fine. The brig, coal laden, was bound from Newcastle to London, and was in charge of a pilot. On arriving between Woolwich and BlackwaU she engaged a steamtug, in tow of which she proceeded up the river, both vessels being very little, accarding to her account, to the starboard side of mid-channel, in order to prevent the tide setting them into the dangerous bight of Black-wall. Imsmediately enrounding Blackwall poinb abe descried La Plats, in tow of a steamtug, right ahead, distant about the eighth of a mile. The brig and the steamtug towing her instantly ported their helms, and aftrwards put them bard a-port; tne steamtug towing La Plata and also La Plata ported their helms, but too late, and the latter ran stem on into the brig, doing her so nuch damage that sh was obliged to be run on shore to prevent her sinkingin deep water. La Plata, belonging to the South American and General Steaim Navigation Com pany, 'was Lcksoceeding from Deptford, in bslaMt, to tho VictoriaDo.- and, as s-he stated, on observing the brig in full sail, tugn he south sb ore, she hailed her to.port her helm, but it was not done until she had been hailed tbreo or four times, and when it was too late to avoid the collision, which she attributeOd to the brig coming up the river on the south instead of the north shore.
Dr. ADDAS and Dr. Twiss were heard for the brig; Dr. RoBn;soN and Dr. JENNnR for La Plata,
The learned JUDGox having conferred with the Elder Brethren, by whom he was assisted, said they were of opinion that Ia Plata was to blame for the collision.
TSE CYRUS.-COLLISION.
This was a suit brought by the brig Mary, of the burden of 115 tons, against the brig Cyrus, whose burden was not stated, to recover the loss arising from a collision between them at 3 a.m. on the 27th of April, 1854, a little to the northward of Flamborough Head. Both vessels were in ballast, and proceeding to the north for coals. Accordin
to the representation of the Mary the morning Was fine and] clear, and being hailed by a number of men in a boat, she hove to in order to take them on board, and was not then under command. The Cyrus was seendistant nearlya mile and she continued approaching without altering her helW
until it was too late to avoid the co ision. The Cyrus, on the other hand, alleged that the morning was so dark that vessels could be seen from each other only at the distance of a quarter of a mile; that the Mary having no light exhibited she was unable to discover her exact position until it was too late to avoid coming into contact with her.
Dr. DEaNE and Dr. SPiis were hoard for the Mary; Dr. ADDAms and Dr. Twis for the Cyrus.

(Before Mr. Commisioner HoLRoyD.i
-Lne oanirups was a ralLway-grease manufacturer, of King's.ero5e.
flhis was the certificate meeting.
Mr. LuNx TZR, for tho assignees of the Royal British Bank, said that in January, 1856, the bankrupt had a sir-
lns of 4,6521, and that the circumstnce of his being the holder of 40 shares in the Royal British Bank had been the cause of his bankruptcy. His clients eympathized with
arties in the bankruipt's position. The shareholders had been deluded to the last moment. Underthe circumstances they were willing that the bankrupt should iceceive a first. class certificate.
Mr. LAWIrU.NC, for Mr. Thomas, a creditor, complained that the bankrupt had, some days after the stoppage of the hank, settled 1,2501. upon his daughter on the occasion of
Mr. Cusiecir, for the bankrupt, urged that the terms of thfe settlemkent had been arranged long before the stoppage of the bank. ~ ~ ~ eth sopag His Hoiouu granted a first-class certicfiate.
MIr. Commiss8oner GoUa,ReN hero entered the Court, and said he wished to take the opinion of his brother commissioner (Holroyd). These cases were becoming very frequent, and the question arose, could the position of shareholders, on becoming thus bankrupt, be regarded as arising wholly from unavoidable loss and misfortune?
His HoNoul (Holroyd) said that, in the case of parties who had taken shares on which they posseseed the means of paying the ordinry calls, he considered their bankruptcy arose from unavoidable loss and misfortune. Acting on this principle, he had just granted a first-class certificate. The case might be different where parties with insufficient maeans had entered inato speculation.
His HONOUR (0-oulburn) said he should endeavour to a certain extent to act upon this view of the case. At the same time, he must observe thawt he felt it so necessary at the present moment to hold parties to their engagements, that he should only grant second-chass certificates to bank. rupts wvho had incrred liabilities in shares beyond their reasonable means of discharging-who had entered into contracts which they were wholly unable to fulfil.
IN RE J. 3BUTwCn .
The bankrupt was a licensed victualler, of Churqh-stree, Hackney. This was the examination meeting.
Mr. Omnvxy, for the assignees, said it would' Appear that the bankrupt had been previously bankrupt-viz., in 1849, when he failed to pass his examination, He,had subsequently obtained the benefit of the Iosolvent Court. Under the circumastanoes, ho suppiosed it would be necessary that the bankrupt should pass his examination under the first bankruptcy before he could do so under the bankruptcy now before the Court. He suggested an adjournment for three mnonths for that purpose.
His HoNouit concurr Adjourned accordingly.

IN LIZ J. L DE JONGE.-IN RE R. C1RISTIAN.
The bankrupt De Jonge was a merchant in Mark-lane. The bankrupt Christian was -. coffeo merchant in Mincing. lane. This was an adjourned certificate meeting.
Mr. Miller appeared for the assignees of De Jonge, Dr. Amory for the Assignees of Christian, Mr. Roy for the London and Westminster Bank, and Mr. Lucas for the bankrupts.
Mr. RoY said that De Jonge, after contracting debts in America to the amount of 45,000., had, a few years ago, come to this country. Since his arrival he had been a prty to the circulation of fictitious bills of exchange to the amount of 30,0001. The creditors were still without any satisfactory account of what had become of the proceeds of these bills. Holland, one of the parties to their negotiation,-was stil too ill to be examined. He was alleged to have had nearly the whole of the proceeds, and was made the scapegoat in the matter. It would appear, however that the origin of the bills was the introduction of one Mr. Bruck, of Paris, by DeJonge, to Holland. Bruck had got some of the bills discounted in Paris- others had been discounted here. The billspurported to be drawn by Walter, Irvin, and Co., of Bor. deaux, and King and Co., of New York. These fimns, however, were not to be found, and there was no doubt the bils -were manufactured in London.
The bankrupt De Jonge having stated the circumstances under which he had transacted business with Christian, to whom he had been introduced by HoUaud in June, 185,
Mr. Edwards, official assignee, said that at the last meeting he had been requested to trace certain alleged payments by De Jongo to Holland. He had been unable to do so. De Jonge's statements of cash payments did not correspond with Holland's hooks.
Mr. Roy submitted that the bankrupt De Jonge could not pass. Re bad made bills in a most criminal way.
De Jonge.-Yet may have me tried if you like. You said at a late meeting that I ought to be at the Old Bailey. I ask if you ought not to have been there 20 years ago? I wil place my character against Mr. Roy's. I know your character.
The Co'.mmissioi2s.referring to Holland's evidence in the case of " Von der H1e,deland Von der Heyde'.I find that Holland said he could not s whether De Jonge had the money or not. The account had not been settled. If he wanted assistance, Do Jonge gave it; and if De Jonge wanted assistance, he (Holland) gave it.
De Jonge.-Holland has had the money. o e is
debtor to the amount of of 3,0001. I am also under liabilities in his favour to a much larger amount.
The COsnUSSsoNRm.-De Jonge says the hills camne in a letter from Paris. The letter, he says, is destroyed. This is not a satisfacto lana'tio.
The bankrupt e" onge.-I acted only as agent for Holland.
The CommiSSIOuNER.-Still, when a. man hasa acted as agent in sanding into the world bills which there is reason tobelieve are forgeries, it is his dut to furnish satisfactory information. You do not produce Bruckl o his letters or Holland. Hollandcnotkwof theatofhsgn. All I can say is that I am not satisfiedwith the explanations or the accounts. I sms motn namratl

Mx. Comnissioner GoimnIN said he should adopt the same course with Christian.
Mr. LIucAs submitted that the two cases were widely different. Holland had given evidence that Christian had no knowledge that the bills were fictitious.

(BqforeKr. PASEYR,Q.O,Assistant.Udg ae r aQUnL)
Elen Troy, 34, described as a needleworker, was indicted for unlawfully and maliciously infaicting upon Jane Carey grievous bodily harm.
Mr. Metoalfe prosecuted; Mr. Horry appeared for tho prisoner.
The prosecutrix is the 'wife of Edward Ca.e, of No. 7, Yerk-street, Kingsland-road, and it appeared that An inti. macy of an improper nature had existed between her husband and the prisoner. She deposed that on the 2d of March, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner and her sister went to prosecutrix's house, and in her absence smashed a 'valuable lookling-glass, which was worth between 2l. and 36 When she went home she found the prisoner and another woman in the parlour, end the fragments of the looking-glass lyingabout, upon which the prisoner, without any provocation whateyvr, took up the poker, vith 'which she struck her a violent blow on t e forehead which knocked her down and stunned her, and she was covered with blood. She screamed out, and the Blice came to her assistance, and took her to a surgeon's. ,he had met the prisoner in company with her husband and having called her by a most offensive name threateiel to cut out her other eye. It further appeared that previous to this occuence the proseoatrix apprehended violence from the prisoner, for on her way home on the night in question, she asked the protection of a policeman to see her home, and he accordingly did so and left her at her house. Immediately afterwards, however, the polioeman was called in, and the prisoner was given in charge for brealdng the lookdng-lalss. The prisoner admitted that she had broken tho glass, but said thatshe could payforit. As the husband of the prosecutrib declined to charge the prisoner, the policeman declined to take her, but had scarely quitted the house when he was called back by cries of
murder." On entering the room he found the prosecutrix bleeding very much, and he was told that the prisoner had struck her with the poker. The blood was streaming from her head. The prisoner had been heard to say that if the - charged her she wouldaurder her.
xr. G. W.H. Coward, surgeon of New Nrorth-road, stated that on the morning of the 3d of 3iarch the proseoutrixwas brought to his surgery with a scalp wound on the forehaad, inclining tothe right side. It was such a wound as might have been produced by a blunt instrument like a poker. She had a black eye on the same side, which inight have been produced by the same blow. She had evidently sufered a great deal from the blows she had received.
Mr. HORBY urged, on thS'part of the prisoner, that the proecoutrix was tue aggressor, and that at the most this was but a common assault.
The jury found the prisoner Guilty of having inflicted grievous bodily harm.
TheASTIsxA?T.JUDGE said, that this WaB a very bad case, and sentenced the prisoner to six montha' hard labour.
Thomas Britton, a baker, surrendered to take his trial on an indictment charging him with having stolen two loaves of bread and a quartern of flour, the property of Ann Haynes, his mistress.
Mr. Metcalf appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Ribton for the rsnr
The prosecatrix carzied on the business of a baker in Seckforde-street.' Clerkenwel,' and the prisoner had been employed by her to mak-e up batches of bread. He vas noticed to leave the bakehouse very bulky abont the pockets 'which excited suspicion, and one morning as he was going away he was given in charge and searched. Two loaves were found in his pockets, and a bag containing a quartein of flour was found concealed between his shirt and his kidn.
The jury found him Guilty-sentence, six months' hard labour.
John Kirby, a respectable-looldug man, was indicted for obtaining money from Thomas Burrows by false pretences. He surrendered in court.
Mr. Ribton appeared for, the prosecution; Mr. Metalfe for the prisoner.
The prisoner, who was stated to have been originally an architect and land surveyor, had been in the employment of the proseautor of this indictment, a cooper, at o. 1, Salterstreet, Limehouse, as a foreman, and in that capacity it was part of his duty to pay the workmen their wages. The charge brought against him was that he had, in aeveral instances, made out an account of the wages he had to pay, in
hich he charged more than was actally due and payable to the men against the prosecator. The case was somewhat complicated, and, after some discussion upon a technical

Ann Davis, 23 dressmaker, was indicted for having stolen a gold watch and other articles, value 161., the prcperty of Eleanor Jones, in her dwellinghouse.
Mr. Orridge appeared for the prosecution; Mx. Eorry for the prisoner.
The prosecutrix was a teacher of mnsic, residing at 26, Adelphi-terrace, Bethnal-greert-road, and she bad known the prisoner someoyears. On the 28th of January they acciaentally met in Cheapside, 'when the prisoner told such a tale of misery and poverty that from a feeling of commiseration she gave her her address, and promised if she would call she would do what she could to assist her. On the 4th of Februara she did call, and after she had been there some short time two ladies came to see Miss Jones, and while she was engaged'with them the prisoner went awa7. Soon after she was gone a gold watch, two gold chaims, two gold rings, and an initial eeal were missed, some from a bedroom, and some from the kitchen mante!shelf. It appeared that on the ladies callIng the prisoner went into the kitchen, where she was leftaone fora few minutes while the servant went out, and when she came back she saw the prisoner coming down the stairs leading from the bedrooms, but she took no notice particularly of that circumstance, as she considered the prisoner was a friend of her mistress and on a visit. The prisoner went away, saying sbe would be back in half-an-hour. As no one had had access to where the things were between the time they were seen safe and when they were missed she was suspected, and information given to tho police. When the prisoner was apprehended she said she knew nothing of the robbery; but it was proved that
by her d on,a person named Henry Larkinhbd pawned a gold watch, which was produced and identified as the property of Miss Jones.
The jury found the prisoner Gui1ty.
Mr. OSR}ASY said, he had never met with a worse care of aggravated robbery, and he should sentence the prisonerto be kept to hard labour for 12 calendar months.

at the former examination Alderman, the gaoler, intimated that the skins of the cats which were so cruelly tortured were readily purchased by a number of German furriers living in the neighbourhood of the spot whern the prisoner was seen by several boys to empty the quvering bodies of four or five cats out of a large bag he carnled, and that the okis were more applicable to their purposes and fetehed a higher price when obtained in that manner.

It appeared from the evidence that Mrrs. Edwards, the wife of the prosecutor, had oocasion to enter her bedroom, on the first-floor of her dweing, on Thursday afternoon, and eaw the prisoner tying up a bundle. The drawers .Were open, and the room was in a state of confusion. Mrs. Edwards ran downstairs and raised an alarm, and her husband went up to the room, and as he entered it the prisoner rushed to the windowr got upon the parapet outside, and jutmped into the yard below, a distance of from 3.2 to 14 feet, and ran away. As she left the house she ran against a young man named Charles Hall, waiter at a publichouse, and fell down. She soon recovered herself aud fled, pursued by Mr. Edwards, Hall, and others, wbo soon gained uponher, andsbe rushed into a house in White Horse-Court. A police-constable named Kelly, No. 130 1, soon afterward arrived, and he searched the house and found the prisoner concealed in the cellar behind some boards, which he was compelled to remove before he could get at her. On Mr. Ecdwards returning to the room in which he had seen the prisoner he found a bundle which contained his wife'swearing appaelwrappednp inasha'wl belonging to the prisoner, and to whom it was restored at the station-house. The prisoner musthavecrept upstairs while Mlr.andMr..Edwards were busy attending to their customera in the bar. The prisoner exclaimed when the charge Was maade aginst her at the station-houze, " Have mercy upon me, for the sake of my child 1'
The prisoner, on being called upon to plead, said she was "Guty," and that want induced her to commit the robbery.
Mr, SELvz asked if the prisoner was known.
Kelly, the police-constable wlho had charge of the case, Faid that the prisoner was a most incorrigible tbief, and had been convicted of a robbery similar to the one she was now charged with committing at the Mansion-house Policecourt. The prisoner came out of plrison last Saturday.

LA3rEM.-John Reeves, a stout-built, middle-aged man, w.ho described himself as a woodcutter, was placed at the bar before the Hon. G. 0. NORTON2, on the following charge of highwayrobbery:-
Arr Henry B. Evans, a surgeon, residing in Kenningtonlane, deposed that on the precediingevening he had been out to an electioneering dinner, and on leaving the tavern at which he dined heaccompanied afriendto hishousto have acigir, and stopped rather late. At about 3 o'clock, in passing along the St. George's-road on his way home, he was accosted by a woman who perdited in speaking to him, and at the moment he s approached by two or three men, one of whom cslled out, "What areyou doingwith thatwoman ?" He replied, " Nothing, and I only wish she would go about her business and not annoy mue" He had scarcely uttered these words when one of the men tripped himn up, and threw him with great molence on the pavement, face downwards, and inicted the injuries then so perceptible on his nose, face, and forehead. Recovering the momentary shock he (Mr. Evans) jumped up, vnd finding that his purse had been taken from his trousers pocket, he at once seized the prisoner charged him with being concerned in robbing him, and at t6is time he saw two other men run across the road towards Newington. The prisoner at that time denied the charge, and a3id ha had just before seen him (prosecutor) at the bar of the Waggon and Horses pubichoua treatinj several women of the town, and that if he had been robbed at all it mnst have been there. This statement was quite false, as he had not been into any pub]ichouse at all, and he therefore handedthe prisoner over to the constable, onthe chare oof being concetned in the robbery. In cross-examination oytheprlsonerthewitnessadmittedthat onhisrepresenhtion of innoconce he let him go, andwas proceeding with the constable to the stationhouse'to give information of the robbery, when he returned and gave him in stody. mr. Evans, however, added that his goi back and giving him into cutody was owing to what ha been told him by a witness who would be called. He also said that in his breast pocket he had a pocket-book, containing property, but this had fortunately escaped the notice of the thieves, and they only took his purse, which contained about lve shillings.
Richard Hanson, a journeyman hatter, was next called, And gave a somewhat different version of the affair. He said that about the time before mentioned he was in St. George's-road, near to Reas's horse repository, when he heard some person exclaim, "I have been robbed of my purse," and, on looking in the direction whence the voice
roceeded, he saw theo rosecutor holding a woman, whom rac¢csedof robbing him.

This Was an action to recover damages for injaries re. coaved by tho plaintiffs from the negligence of the defendant in not sufficiently protcting some alterations ho was making at the Birkenhead Pier, of which he is the lessoe, whereby the plaintiff's wifo fell off it on to the shore.
Mr. James, Q.., and Mr. Brett appeared for the plain. tiffs; and Mr. Atherton, QC., and Mr. MiElward for the defendant.
It appeared that the plaintiff is an engineer, residing at, Tranmere, and that his wife at the time of the accident carried on business as a dressmaker. On Saturday, the loth of January lut, abe had beon at Liverpool and crossed to Birkenhead to the Birkenhead pier at 5 o'clock by the de. fendaut's ferryboat. Itwslowwaterat thetime, and on xariving at Birkenhead andpaying her fare at the Ferry-house she proceeded on shore by the pier. It was then quite dark. There wasa shed on the left hand side for coals and luggage, in which there was a light, which shone through the win. dow. There were Chais and poets running along the side of the river, but, owing to a place where some alterations were being made being left unguarded, she got outside the chain between the chains and the river in mnaking for the light, which had the e£oct of dazzling tho eyes of the ps. Eengcrs without showing them thedanger. Shefound she had made a mistake, buton turning round to go back again she fell off the pier on to the shore, a distance of 30 feet, by wbich she was nearly killed. She waz taken insensible to the hospital, where she was found to be suffering from concusson of the brain. She was confined in tho hospital a fortnight, And sdce she bad leftit she had suffered much in herhead, her eyesiht, and her limbs, and had since been uable to carry on her business. It was endeavoutred to be elicited on the cross-examination of tho plaintiffWs wife that she was not quite sober at the time of the accident-she having tal;en a glass of rtun before she left Liverpool-with the view of showing theaccidentto hAvo been partly her own fault. It was, however,admitted eventuallythat shewwas sober, and much evidence was then called to show that the pier
as'ufficiently protected, although since the eccident additional posta and chains hadbeen put up.
The cme occupied the greater part of the day. The jury retired to consider their verdict at 5 oclock, and at8 o'clock at night returned with a verdict for the plaintiff-Damages, 404

This was an action on a policy of insurance effected in the defendans company against fire, to which the defencdants ploadedvarious pleas imputing fraud to the plaintiff.
Mr. Attorney-General nXowles, Mr. Monk, and Mr. plandap red for the laintiff; and Mr. Eill;, QC, And Mi. Cole sor the defendxnms
The facts of the case were that Mr. Georgo Buckham, the plantiff, claimed 5001. on apolicyof insuancoe effected in the office of the Anchor Anrne Company upon a quantity of waste yarn ad cotton which he had stored in his warehous, Golden-street, Rochdalse-road, Manchester. The policy con. tained a warranty by the plaintiff that there should be no oily waste or artificial lghts. In 1854 the plaintiff held a warehouse in Back Tuner-street, and rooms in different other parts of Mhnchester, all of which were filled with waste cotton. In M1arch, 1855, he took a large warehouse in Back Turner-street. He gave up hiu various storerooms, and filled this place wvith his goods The warchouse was so filled with goods that it broko down. After this occurrence plaintiff took the warehouse in Golden.street, to which the present action had reference; and this warehouse he filled with goods of the same description. At the time of this latter removal he was insuredin the North of En land offce to the amount of 1,6001. upon the stock he had had in Back Turner-street. On his removal that comPany consented to transfer a po17 of 80 from Back Turner-street to the premises in Golden-street. When the annual premium
came payable in March to the North of England offioe tbat company refused to go on with one of the insurances, and the plaintiff accordingly resolved on effecting a insurauce ith some other company. Mr. Carr, agent for the lforth of England Company, introduced Mr. Buckham to Mr. Lees, agent for the Anchor4 Assurance Company, which companLy M. Carr had suggested to him as one which would probably accede to his effecting tho insuranee Mr. Lees agreed to the ro,sa, and the plaintiff took him to the warehosse in Ien strt, and showed him how tho goods were stored. On this occasion Mr. Lees remarked the very large amount of stock stored in the building. 'The warehouse contained three stories, with a cellar. A small nantity of oily waste was observed in one of the upper .rnes, and, Mr. Lees having pointed it out, it was agreed that it shouldberemoved. This the plaintiff averred that he did; andthen5 he having paid the premium, the policy was isued to him on th ed of April, 1856, for 500C. The plaintiff also insurd with the Kent Mutial Fireofflce or M A fire took plac on the 13th of May; by which property Was destroyed belonging to the plaintiff to the estimated value of 1,7004 Thoplatiff atod te t he saw Mr. Lees and Mr. Turner, the representatives of the Anchor Anurce andNorthof England companies. Mr. Lees offered him 1,2004 on behalf of all ihe offloes, the companies to have the alvage. This, however, the plaintiff refused, stating that he had lost 1,7004, and was only insured in all for 1 5001, and that he wsw entitled to as much salvage as woulA maJe up the difference. Subsequently a person named Thomas, emtployed by several insarance-offices, ws sent to inspeot the place where the fire broke out and the salvage. After this the payment of thd policy was refsed on the ground that, alter it had been issued,
caused to be stored in the waehouse a largo quantity of oily waste, contrary to the war. rantry oontained in the policy, and without giving notice immediately of the loss and d mage, or delivering as particular and ful account of the loss, as he could have donethat he had not given notice of thepoliies held elsewhereand, finally, that the claim was excessive and fraudulent.
The plaintiffand several other witnesses wpre examined to prove that there never had been any oily waste stored in the wehouse, and that in all other respects the requirements of the nolji h.A h.,., __1:_...
Mr. H. HmI. utated the case for the defendants, who, he contended, were bound in justice to them. selves, the other comprnies, and the public to resist this claim in order that it might be fuly Investigated. He urged tbat he should be able to show that oily waste oe1 been stored on the premisisa sabsequent to the effecting of the policy, snd thaE the company had not been inforned of the other poicies ; and that the claim was so excessive as to be in point of fat fraudulent.
A number of witnesses were then called for the defence to prove that in the removal of the salvage there was found a quntity of oi2y wate, and als that the amount claimed by te plaintiff was excessive.

BLAUE V. THE LAiNCAIRX AND YORKSIIIE RAILWXY
COMPANY.
This ws an action brought by the plaintiff to recover damages for sn injury received on the defendants' railway. The defendants paid 2501. into court, and denied that the plaintiff had received damage beyond that amount.
Mr. Attorney-General Knowles and Mr. Aspland agpeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Hugh. ill, QC., and M £. omlinson for the defendants.
The plsintiff, It appeared, in a draper, carrying on bus!ness in Deanagate, lanchester, in a large wray, and employing 28 asistants. During the summer season he had also an establishment at BlackpooL In October lAst he was travelling between Manchester and Blackpool, when the railwa train, belonglng to the defendants company, in w ch e was traveling, ran into a number of coal trucks
which were being shunted across the line near the Ribblebridge, at Preston. A violent concussion took place, and the plaintiff received a severe concussion, which gave a great shock to his ystem, and his right leg wa also much contused, and ho had been obliged to undergo a serious opera tion in consequenoe. The shock he had received had produced a parislr paralys of the throat, and his nervous System EneraUl was much shaken. Dr. Risk, of Blackpool,
d .oran, sgeon, proved the severe nature of the injuries the plaintff hha receiveod, which had precluded him from attending to his husimnes for nearly sixE months. During the first six months of that year ha had realized 6501. profit from his busdness, but during the Ilat six months of the year ha had loot nearly 2001. from nxot being ahlo to attend to his businese, although his profits were always less that half-year.

The prosecutor, Mr. Sultzer, is a highly reqmecd 'merchant and ruitrate of this city, and this was a criminal information lsd at his instance aginst the defendant for diseminating several libelloun letters reflcting on his gene. ralchacterandhonesty. It appearedthatthedefendant had been in the employ of the prosctor, and that, a differeceo having risen between them as to the amount of remuneration to which the defendant Was entitled, he had written the letters in question.
After some few pgesof these lett only had been read by the learned 3EEJXrAT,
The JuDGn interposed, and eventually
Mr. Powzx expressoe4on behalf of lii client, his extreme sorrow andregret that he should have been led to circulate the attacks on the prosecutor, for which there was no other foundation than the pecuniary claim wimich he bond A~de believed to exist. It had been almost arranged that all the matters in dispulte hould bo reerredto a priveriffbt n l, and heg Tentued now to suggest that this infrainan all other disputes should now be referred.
Mr. 3ericant BYLEs could not aent, to include this information, which was brouht for the vindication of his client's character. If the defendant would apologize and withdraw the chrges the prosecutor would be content, and would not call up the defendant for sentence unless he should repeat Ins improper conduct. Ag to the claims of the defendant upon him, if any existed, the law was opien to him.
Mr. Power thenL made the required apology, urging on h is clin's behalf that his mind was at times not quite sound.

IMr. Edwards prosecuted.
It appeared that the Prisoner in June, 1853, applied to a person naned Richmond, living at Tauton, for the loan of 801. Richmond said he had no objection, provided he bad two good sueties. The prisoner said bis brother James and his sster, Mrs. Hodge, of Bridgewater, would join him in a promissory note for the payment of the money. Richmond drew a note, which the prisoner took away for the purpae of procuringthe signaturesof hisbrotherandsister. The ri soner afterwards brought back the note apparently signed Ub
the prisoner's brother and eister, The risoner subsequently p wa some of the instalments, and he then left Bridgewater, where he had carried on the trsae of a butcher, and it was not known to what part of the country he had gone. Richmond then applied to James Morris and Mrsm Hodge, when they declared that the signatures were not in their handwriting. Richmond discovered that the prisoner was residing at Wolverhampton, and he brought an action against the three. The prsonerallowed judgment to goby default, and he was upon that taken to Stafford GaoL The cause came on for trial at the present assizes, and the prisoner and his brother and dster were all called as witnesses, and the two latter swore most positively that they had not signed the note, and had not given authority to the prisoner to sign their names; and a letter was put in from the prisoner to his siter saying that he had done wrong, bht he hoped to be able to pay the money. Upon this a verdict was taken for the defendants, and Mr. Justice Williams committed the prioner for the forgery, and he was now placed at the bar for triaL
A letter was put in by the prisoner, written by one of his daughters to another daughter, stating that her aunt was in such a state of mind about tho note that she fearedrit would kll her, and begging him to write to her and say that she had not signed it, and also urging the prisoner to go away for fear he should be taken up for forgery. It was a very painful letter, breathing great affection towards the father.
The jury found the prisoner Guilty, md he 'was sentenced to 14 years transuortation, but the earned Chief Justice afterwards altered the sentence to two years! imprisonment en accoant of his being an old man.

After breakfast we were standing up, and he told the boatswain to go to the foreoastle and take some men with him - and I went on the top of the deakhouse. A man named Chrystiecarne on deck with me; Chrystie came on deck after me; the prisoner was standing behind him. Chrystie told the second mnate we did not ship for that vessel; when the prisoner laid of him by the back of the neck. Chrystie ran away. The seoond mate (thie prisoner) had a pistol in his hand. It had six barrels. I urber, the chief mate, then pteked tup a. billet of wood to strike Chrystie with. He threw s at the latter, and then picked it up again. Tho prisoner was chasing Cbrystie as welL The prisoner then cried out, "Shoot the-, if they won't work !" The prisoner fired three timnes at Chrystie. The chief mate fired as well. -After firing they went off. Chrystie then camne and stood by inse. The prisoner and tho chief mate came to us. The prisoner then said, " Will you work ?" we replied, " We will
if you will treat us like men." The pnsoner then fired at me, but did not hit me. I heard a ball whistle paSt. He then fired at Chrystie, and the latter cried out,
Oh, God, I'm shot." Before firing the prisoner said. I'll shoot every one of you." Chrystie steood sti after being shot. One of the men then struck the chief mate, and be fell on deck, The chief mate was struck with a bandspike. When he fell he was bleeding very much. The prisoner then went aft, the men following after. The pilot and steward then ran up a signal of distress, and soon after the officers came on board. The chief mate and Chrystie were taken to the hospital.
Cross-examined.-I do not know the steward. I can read. I belong to the Virgin Islands, in the West Indies. We did not refuse to work ,after breakfast. I did hear the chief mate order the second mate to put Chrystie in chains for mutiny. Isuppose I was ordered to be put in chains as well. I had a handspike in my hand. Chrystie had a handspike; he had a knife as well. The others had handspikcs in their hands. They had thoir spikes in their bands before the first abot was fired. Chrystie had the sheath knife in his hand when he was ordered to go to work; the prisoner ordered Chrystie to put it up before he shot; Mr. Harrison, the pilot, was on deck, aft, part of the time. As soon as the officer came on deck we (the men) were accused of mutiny; the cabin boy (a white lad) was on deck at the time. When the chief mate fell I saw blood flow freely from bim; the men followed the mates across the vessel, but did not throw anything at them which I could see.
James Chrystie. -On the 18th of January last I went on board the James L. Bogart. I saw the prHsoner there. I had xmy breakfast on board. After breakfast the boatswain came on deck and coiunted us. I told the prisoner that I did not ship for the vessel, and I would not work. The prisoner then laid hold of me, and said, "What did you say?." I again repeated what I said before, when the chief mate (who was standing by), said "Put that son of a -in irons." I got from them and ran away. Both mates ran after, but could not cateh me. They fircd five or six times at me. I went on the top of the topforegaUant forecastle, when both mates came up, and each present-d a pistol at mny head. The pris-ner had a sword as weU as a pistol. Vhen he presented the pistol at my bead he asked me to work. I said I would not. He then said "If you don't I will shoot you." Ho then fired at and shot me in the tbigb. He fired at me twice on the topgallant forecastle , the first shot did not take effect, the second did, and lodged itself in my left leg. I then shouted out, "I'm shot." Before I was shot the crew were at work. I did not see any liandspikes in the bands of the crew before I was shot. The pUot and steward then hoisted a flag of distreas. Before I was shot I had a knife in my hand for the purpose of usslashing some spars. I had no knife in my hand whei I was shot. I was taken to the hospital, where I was attended to by the surgeon.
Cross-examined.-The spars were not loose, but were lashed. All the men wero not standing by mo when I refused to work. When the prisoner laid hold me I caught hold of his arm; I did not strike him. At that time I had a knife in my hand. The second mate told me to put it away, and I did so. I did not strikle either of the mates. Vhen I was shot I saw the chief mate lying on the deck; I did not strike him down. I can't swear exactly which mate shot me, but I believe it was the prisoner, fromn the position in which he stood. The crew were all given into custody for mutiny. ido not know whether thecabihinbov was on deck. I did not see any disturbance before I was sbet.
John Robinson.-I am a seaman on board the James L. 3Bogart. I was on board on the 19th of January. The men were divided and set to work. I ain boatswain. I was ordered to take some men to the topgallant forecastle. The prsoner ordered ine to take them there. When I got thero
ciheard a noise; I looked down the gangway, and I heard Cbrystie and Vanderpole telling the mates that they did not ship for the vessel. Campbell (the prisoner) drew a pistol from his belt and struck at the men witlh the butt-end of it. The men ran round the little woodeir house and the mates followed. I heard the prisoner say he would blow their brains out. The two officers then fired three rounds each. The men then mustered on the forecastle. The chief mate, Farber, loaded his two pistols, and said if 'the men would not come down he would make them. The prisoner then ran and got a sword, and the chief mate said to hiil, " licep on the same side as me, and we will strike them aU down as they stand." They asked the men again to come down; the men refused. The prisonor then said to the chief mate, " Fire aniong tbem,-fire them down." Furber them fired among us, and then ran after one named Jones. Jones said, "Do you mean to take my life?" Furber said, " I do." Jones then said, pickinig up a hand. spike, " I wiU stand on my own defence." Campbell (the psisoner) then fired at Chrystie four times; the pistol missed Jiro three timcs; the fourth time it took effect. After Furber had fired at Jones Jones struck him on the head, and knocked him down. This was after Chrystie was shot.-
Cross-examined.-Vanderpole refused to work when he found he was not in the right ship. The whole of the erow refused to work after the shots were fired. I had no weapon about me. The ofiicers fired three rounds among the whole of the men when they were standing on the gangway. The men were 17 in number. I did not see Furber after he was knocked down until after his death. Chrystie had been using a knife to unlash some spars before breakfast.
John Welsley.-I was a seaman on beard the James L. iBogart. I was there on the 19th of January. I was boatswain. We turned out to work at 6 o'clock in the morning. We worked until breakfast time. After breakfast we mustered and were set to work. I had to go aloft. When I was going aloft I heard Chrystie say to the chief mate that lie had not slipped on board the James L. Bogart, but for the Robin Hood, and Chrystie ran away from the place where he was standing then, because the chief mate said, " I'll give you Robin Hood." The chief mate and the inrsoner then armed themselves and followed him. They
bot bad pistols, and the prisoner had a sword. All the men then mustered on the forecastle, and the prisoner fired at Vanderpole. The shot missed Vanderpole, and the prisoner then fired again and bit Chrystie. I heard Chrystie cry out, " I'ni shot." The chief mate was knocked down by a man named Jones. The captain had been absent two or three days before this happened.
Cross-examined.-I came on board on the 17th of January. I was not drunk when I came on board. When Chryeie was shot he was by himself. I was imprisoned in the forecastle the night before, because I wanted to go on shore.
Joseph IIarrison.-I was on board the vessel James L. Bogart on the 19th of January as pUot. I did not see the whole of the affray. I heard the pnsoner say, after he had shot Chrystie, " I am sorry I did not shoot the b- b- through the head." Never saw any insubordination among 'the men.
Cross-examined.-I was down in the cabin until after sonme of the shots were fired. I saw five shots fired by the prisoner rnd the chief mate. I ordered the flag of distress to be hoisted.
Thomas Smith.-I am a Liverpol police officer. On tho 19th of January I went on boardthe James I Bogart about 11 o'clock in the morning. I went into the cabin, where I saw the prisoner. I said to the prisoner, "Where is that pistol?" rie said, " The pistol I shot him with ?" I said, "Yes." He then went to a drawer and produced a sixbarrel revolver. Threo of the barrels were discharged and the remains of caps were upon them all. Prisoner said to me, I J am only sorry I did not blow his brains out, the - black son of a-."
Alexander Wilson Marshall.-I am house-surgeon at the dispensary, Birkenhcad. I had a patient thero named Chr, she in oanssary, who was confined to his bed for some weeks in consequence of a gun-shot wound in his left thigh. The wound must have been caused by firearmseither a guin or a pistol. The bullet is still in his leg.
That coneluded the case for the prosecution.
Mr. MI'IxYRE having addressed the ury on behalf of the prisoners.
His LoRDSiiip sumied up. The question for the jury was whether the pistol was fired; if it was under what circ:umstances ? The learned counsel for the aefence had made mnany suggestions not bearing u pon or arising out of the evidence. If they (the jury) were tobo guided by the counsel they would have to disbelieve all the witnesses and believe someihing else-not a very logical way of dealing with the evidence. But he (his Lordship) would tell them that they were to he guided by the evidence, and that alone. He then went through each witness's statement, which he said was strongly against the prisoner, and he could not perceive what defence there was to the charge. It would be for them first to consider whether the prisoner fired the shot ; if he did, whether he had any intent to commit murder. Secondly, if they came to the conclusion that he fired the pistol without a murderous intont, they were to consider whether hie intended to do grievous bodily harm. Thirdly, if they w7ere not of that opinion, they were at liberty to say that he was guilty of unlawfully wounding. If they had a doubt about the matter, they were to give the prisoner the benefit PI thp bub pad acquit him, On the other hand, if they
were satisfied that the prisoner fired the pistol, they could find him guilty o' either of the three charges.
The Jury after deliberating upwards of an hour and a- half, brought in a verdict on the s&cond count.
FtS LORDSHIP, in sentencing the prisoner, said,-Peter Campbell, for several hours your lifo has been at stake. I bave never heard such a case in all my life. You. with a murderous weapon in your hand, weat about the decks of your vessel firing upon the crew. There is no kind of excuse to be found in the evidence, for God's mercy alone prevented youfromnmurdering the man,inwhiohcsseyou would havo been tried for that most feariul crimne. I must mark your crime with such a, punishment as will be a warning to all others. This is a land in vhich such things are not to '.e tolerated. I shall mark your crime with the highest punish. ment allotted by the IAv. The sentence of the Court upoil you is that you be transported beyond the seas for the terma of your natural life.
The sentenoe created coasiderabI2 excitement in court, The prisoner's faoe was Ilvshed for ax instant on hearing his sentence, and he left the court deeply moved.

IRISH APPoiN-raraxs.-31r. Thomas O'Hagan, Q.C., has just been appointed a Commissioner of Charitable Donations and Bequests, in the room of Lord Bellew, who has resigned in consequence of his inability to attend the meetings of the board. Referriug to this appointment, the .Reniny Post remarks:-" If there be any persons, clerical or lay, who at the cnd of the 12th year of this board's existence, and without a single charge of partiality or sectarian feelino having being proved against any one of its members, still retain feelings of diffidence towards it, we cannot doubt that the appointment of Mr. O'Hagan will, in the minds of such persons, convert these feelings into those of trust and confidence; for we feel aEsnred that there is not a Catholic in Ireland who would not with unswervinz alacrity confide the nearest and dearest interests of his religion to the keeping of Mr. O'Elagan. That the board of charities has not to the fullest extent carried out the objects for which it was originally constituted must be admitted, but if it has failed, the failure has not been attributable to any disinclination on the part of the commissioners to execute their trusts fairly and efficiently, but to defects and shortcomings inherent in the act of incorporation, which we hope before long to see entirely remedied." The same ournal announces that "MIr. Robert Jobnston, of the r orth-west Circuit, has been appointed AssistantBarrister for the county of Longford, in the roora of Mr. Thomas O'Hagan, Q.C., who has been promoted to the chairmanship of Kilma nham. Mr. Johnston is one of those right-minded Protestants who never participated in the views of the Orange party of this countiy, but, on the contrary, was always a true and consistent LiberaL and a Liberal in a part of the country and on a circuit where liberality is not in fashion. For his appointment Mlr. Johnston is solely indebted to his high character and legal attainments, and we have been assured it was conferred on him without any solicitation orn his part." The Freeman's Journal mentions that, when a sbudent in Trinity College, Mr. Johnston signed a peWtion for Catholic relief, and incurred the censure of the authorities for his boldness, The menaced expulsion, or at least rustication, however, subsided into an admonitory reprimand.

THE PoIsox TRnDE.-A letter dated Parsonstown, Thursday evening, published in Satusdcra's Nemsletter, says:-" It has just been officially reported to the authorities hero that the Rev. James Alexander, LL.D., expired about 12 o'clock at his residence, KiUyguley, near Perlane, from the consequences of his having partaken of arsenic in arrowroot, which was ordered for him when convalescent frort a receot alight indisposition. It will be recollected that the rev. gentlenman sent to the shop of a grocer, named Whitfield, in the town of Ferbane, for one pound of arrowroot, which unbappily was made up with a careless addition of arsenic by a shop. man, named Denis Grogan, who has been held to bail by the local magistrates to take his trial at the next quarter sessions for its administration. The lamented death of the rev. gentleman may vary the character and consequences of the proceedinps to be taket arainat Grogaa and his master, Whitfield. the Rov. Dr. 'exander was much respected and esteemed throughout the county as an excellent landlord, and his death under such unforeseen and distressing circumstances is much regretted. He has left a widow and family, who are plunged in the deepest affliction by their deprivation of a fond and indulgeat parent. There is a strong feeling of indignation at the circumstance that a gentleman of his rank and respectability should be thus, by gross impropriety and carelessness, prematurely removed. The rev. Doator was rector of the parish of Tissarin, but for some time past he had not taken any very active ort in the duties of the ministry. An inquest will be heIFd, the result of which will be reported.
