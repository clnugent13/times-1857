Terrible Railway Catastrophe In Canada.
V2RPIBLR RL WA? OCATASTrOPHE
CAVAD.A.
The following is a more detailed account of the late frightful accidenton-the Hamilton (Canadian) Arid, a branch line connocting Toronto with Detroit. Oar corre spondett at New York describes it as one of the worst ceatlies that have hitherto occurred, even in America The followlng general nartivo Is taken from the Haomil Spctor:-'
" The train from Toronto, dna in ths city at a quarkr to 6 p.m. on the I2th of March, bad come from Toronto as usual, and was proceeding at a moderate rate of speed to pass the swbng ondge cross the Desiardin's Canal. Thome residing a5 a dist nce may not know that a cutting has been made as an outlet to this canal through the Burlington Heights, and that the railway crosses it by a swing bridge, 60 feet at least above the level of the canal. At this time, of course, the water below is covered with toe, about two feet thick. Just before the train reached the bridgo the engine ran off the track, owlng. it is supposed, to soune de ctt in the axle; this, however, is a mere surmise, founded only on the observation of some marks on the road for some distance on the other side of the Spot where the accidentoccurred. The immense weightof the enginecutting throngh the timbers of the bridge produced the effect naturally to be expected. The whole atructure gave way with one frightful crash; the engine, tender, baggage car, and
two first-clas passenger car broke through the severed' framerork and leaped headlong Into the vawning abyss below- the engine and tender erushedat onc through the Ice; the baggage car striking the corner of the tender in the act of falling was turned to one side, and fell some 10 or dozen yards froma the engine. The first passenger car rds'hed afer, and tunng as it ewcended, fell on its roof, breaking partly through the ice and being craused to atoms, while the last car fell endways on the ice, and, strange to say, remained in that position.
"The loss of Uife was of course frightfnl. There were 90 pssengers on the train, and the list of those who have =eaped only numbers about 20. As far as vwe can yet lektn, every one in the first car wakilled, those who were not crushed being drowned by the water, which nearly filled the car. About 30 were in the last car, of whom 10 were taken out dead, and most of the others were fearfull mutilated. The conductor (Mr. Barrett), the deputy suprnntendent of the line, Mr. htir, !nd Mr. Jeeoap, one of the auditOrs, who were on the lind platform, Jumped off and esaped. The express meesenger; Mr. Richardson, a conductor on the road, and the mail conductor were writh the bragg -men. The latter jumped over the baggage he
piled up ready for delivery, and escaped with but slight injury, while the three others went, down, but, miraculously enough, were not much hurt. The engineer and fireman wont under the kce with the locomotive, and their bodies have not yet been reoevered.
"The exciteirent in the city directly the news spread was intense. Hundreds swarrmed towards the Great Western dezt, and streamed along the line to the fatal spot.. There t e scene presented was such as to baffle description. Large loconmotive lamps we-er speedily brought. Fires were kindled ad a lurid glare wss throwin over the shattered remnants. Special trains were despatched to the bridge to bring home the wounded. It was no easy task to descend the steep slope to the canal. Ropes were loweted and ladders attached to them, onw which the dead tnd wounded from the car whilch stood endways were finrs drawn up. Then the bottom of the car whicl had artly sunk through the ice was heown away with axes, and the unfortunate passengers, some sadly mutilated and even cut in pieces, and all saturated with water, were taken out.
ny worked with energ and v;gour; but who was that noble felow that every one must have seen, stripped to his shirt-sleeves, standing up to his miAdle in the freezine water, who, himself a host, did rnore than all the restl We watched him long from the height above, as he hewed away the fragents and extricated the bodies. If ever man deserved a reward, it is he.
As soon as the dead wero dravw up the slope they were either put in tho cars for conveyance to Hamilton, or were laid in a small house near the bridge. It is said tbat one family were in the ears, consisting of a father, mother, and four children. Only one of the children escaped. One of those little ones, a girl about four years of age, -was brought into the house alluded to when we were there. The poor little creature was smiling prettily as if she had been seeping and dru of sgweet things when the accident occurred, n he been launched into the long sleep of death before her dream had vanished from her mind.
"The corpses were taken into ono of the large bagae rooms, wvhere Coroners Bull and Rosebrugh proceededto have them examined, and, when possible, identified.
"As soon as the intelligenoe of the catastrophe reached the city M&ajor Booker and Captain Macdonald's companies of volunteers maurched to the scene. They did so, and every credit is due to them for their conduct. Thepressure of the crowd had all but forced in the strong doors of the depot when the Artillery company arrived. They formed a cordon aroond the room, which was respected. The Rifles marched on to the bridge.
" But few at a time were admitted to view the bodies. On entering, the first we remarked was that of poor Donald Stuart. Several of those who had sat in the City Council with this estimable man were round him and in tears. This is stronger evidence of his worth than anythingwe could say. Next lay the Brantford contractor, Mr. Russell, on whose person was money to the amount of several thound dollars. In the row opposite was Samuel Zimmerman, to whom railways have at length proved fatal; and near him two children, aged one and threo years respectivelv, and she who seemed to be their mother. But we cease bor the present?'
Of 15 passengers taken alive out of the water, five afterwards died. The water in the canal is 18 feet deep, so that nearly all those not immediately kdlled were drowned.
The engie and tender, with the engineer and fireman, were pitched headlong into the canal, and are buried 20 feet below the surface. The baggage car and two pIr. senger cars are completely shattered, and one of the ltter turned bottom side upwards and nearly submerged.
Most of the passengers were from Elamilton, Toronto, and the adjacent towns. Samuel Zimmerman, of Niagara Fallg; ;asIc Buchanan, of Hamilton, vice-president of the road; and Captain Twokey, a popular commander on Lake Ontario, are among the victims. Only one of the lady passengers was saved, and she was much cut and bruised. A German lad, in the hind car, seeing the conductor hastily retreating to the back door, took aInxnm and followed him, andhe, the conductor, and threeothers were the onlypersong who escaped with trifling injuries. Mr. C. J. Brydges, the mnagg director of the railway, Dr. Macklain, and.Mr. T. C. Street, of Chippewa, were on the train, and, although severely injured, escaped with their lives.
Mr. Zimmerman, of Niagara FaUls, was a man most deservedly esteemed, and had amassed great wealth as a railway engineer and contractor. He had an interview with a correspondent (who writes to us from Toronto) at the Canadian Parliament Hiouse only two hours before the accident. His death wil, it is said, Lffect more interests in Canada than those ofal has unfortunate fellow-travellers taken together.
Up to a late hour on the 13th of March numbers of men were employed in breakl-g up the cars, and working with hooks an grapples to recover the bodies of the deceased fromnthevwater. Seven men and two women stillremained unidentified, and it was intended to bury them. Thousands of people were congregated around the scene of the catastrophe, and it was found necessary to employ the Militia to keep the immediate locality sufEciently ciear to permit the workmen to proceed with their labours. 1Passengers were crossing on a raft pending the repair of the bridges There were some marvellous escapes. Henry August, passenger from Toronto, escaped from the firstear. The escape of this person was most wonderful. He is a German,and he and the last-named passenger were sitting together on the rear seat of the first passenger car. The moment they heard the first concussion they got up aud rushed toeether to the door; the latteronly reached the platforn. le jumped off just three feet from the ehasm. The other car rushed by him and was gone. He stood for a momentparalyzed. Ho then ran down the hill, and was the means of saving from drowning his companion, who was not in time to reach the platform. He dragged him out of a window, and comparatively unhurt.
A woman w ho lives near the scene of the disaster, and who was the first to witness it, gives some interesting par ticulars about two children (the Doyles) who miraculously escaped. She rushed down the hil to the cars; indeed, the poor woman literaUy rolled down, for it was so steep and slippery she could not keep her feet; and the first object that met her attention was the poor little girl, about eight years of age, on a cake of ice. The little thing said, " Oh, don't mind me, save my brother ;" and the poor httle fellow was at the mooment with his chin barely above water, at the top of one of the windows, imploring some one to drag him out. The woman, though the ice was broken for some distance round the car, managed to reach him, and after rescuing him rushed up the hill with one child in her arms, and got a passenger, who was himself badly wounded, to carry the girl on his back. She put them to bed, and, strange to say, they got up with scarcely a mark. Owen Doyle, the uncle of the Iftte girl, saved her by clasping her to his breast when he felt the car overturning, and throwing her out of the windowv after the crash. The little boy felt some one take himhin his arms and fall under him, but he knew not whom. It is difficult to conceive a more melancholy spectacle than to see these two children looking on the mangled remains of their mother, father, and nearly all who were dear to them.
The escape of Richardson, Mr. IJrquhart, of the express the mail conductor, and the baggage-m aster, was equally marvellous. When the locomotive and tender went literally it the abSyfh bgage-ear swaug round aonarentlv as it
was going over, and broke loose from the tender. -Th consequence was, it struck on tho ice to the left of where the locomotive disappeared; and slid, so strong -was the ice, a short ditance. It never overturned ; and its three inmates, though tbrown among trunks and al sorts of things, strange and happy to say, escaped with but barely trifling brises. The conductor, hearing the smash of the bridge, and standing at the open door of the car, leaped out just at the brink of the abyss. He escaped unhurt.
We quote the following from the Daity Cotonis on the cause of the accident. After giving detaUs to prove the faulty construction of the bridge it says:-
II We do not vwish to go further into the inefficiency of the bridge or its imperfect construction. The locomotive manifestly Owent on to the bridge on the track. That is obvious and indisputable. The bridge brealdng down with it on it, whether an a.xle were broken or not, settles the matterof inadequate construction. As to the train running on to the bridge too fast, it is, in our judgment, a fallacy; belause if tbe train was going at an unusual speed for the
glace, tpe people whojumped off, and were unhurt, couldnot have done so, or might have been kldled if they did. And as to the obstruction, or broken axle, or -whatever else it may turn out, being felt for any distance before reaching the bridge,it seems impossible; asthe ergineer could have stopped the train, and clearly never would have allowed it to go on to the bridge with such an obstruction, aud that under hii o*n locomotive. The obstruction, wbatever it was, is the only thing that we cab detct that tore dawn the bridge, 'for w e are unwilling to conchlde, after the trials it hbashvadjthat it gave way under thie bare weight of the loco-

Thne prcliminary quarterly meeting of the Staffordshire and Woroerhire ironmasters was held in this town on Thursday, and the attendanoe was numerous. The tiade wa reported to e jmproving, and, although it whsadmitted that undersellg was going forward to a considerable extent, the prices of lasi quarter were firmly maintained. Bars, therefore, stand at 9L per ton, hoop6 101., and sbeets 111. Conxiderableoontract hAve receutly-been enteret into with Americ a houes, and sanguine hopes are entertaned thatin tbe course of afew months, Whenlhe reduced Amerioz tariff will come into oxertloaf A grsa impetus will be given to South Staffordshire exports. .The prices of ptl zert declared to be remarkably firm, cad best mnine were sted to be fetehing 2L. ed. per toe more 'than th were a fort..ht erthree weeks ago.
The nmufacturing trades of Birmingham continue to be lnguid, and some are positively slack. This Is owing to the relucance of mastr manufaectrers, through the high pricoe of rnetals, to make for tock. The cabinet brass-
Sounders suffer particularly from this cause, but the miake of copper and slbrawre i snid at the preaent time to be extensive. Telegrph wire is also in great demand. The manufacture of tin wares is far from active from the scarcity and high tates darged for mnateriaL ' '
The contested elections which have oecrred in, the manufacturing towns of the neighbourhood hAve disturbed rany branches of indaty and stayed the progress of several important contracts Some of the large ironfoundries in the neighbourbood of Dadl,eyare busy, but generally the tWde of te distict is not so attive as it was anticipated it would be.

The usual buiness of the Cloth-halls was to-day so much checked byT the poll at the contested election for this borough that very few isles of cloth were made, but the tone of the trade Is one of a satifactory character.

Linen.-Tbe markets for brown linens Lave been more active, especially for coarse goods.
linet yan firm, and in steadydemand, but the-mills are all kept employed, and stocks re not increasing.
Flax.-The supply of flax wa somnewhat larger, bat it is evident that the qunstit.y to come forward is getting into few hands. Buying continues brisk, and farmers can easily dispore of whatever they have at flli rates.
Cotton.-In the Bel ast trade there is more inquiry for goods, and a prospect of better prices. Weavers are well employed in tow,u and at BaUymena, but in the oountry many looms are Idle. The workmen, however, are all engaed at other departments of labour. The demand for hands at present Iceeps the labour-nirk-et well cleuaed. Fine gOoFds re in better demand, and for coarse fabrics the sales continue sedy.
Witchcraft.
WrTCYHORAFT.
TO TEES EDITOB OF TEE TIMES.
Sir,-If aour correspondent "B. A.' wiU turn to Ephe. damasT., 1, 2, 21, he wil find enumerated manv ab*M~i. nations the doing of the like of which would nauIify 4ny man's Claim to a heavenly inheritance. Among them he will find injutaposition tbestwo-idolatrrand witkchraft, a offenoes of a kindred order. If he wil then turn 4o 1 Corinthians viiL, 4, he will find the aame apostle declaring that an idol is nothing in the world-a sentiment which he repeats in x*, 19. We rgue, then, that if idolatry may be a sin, though an idol be nothiln in the world so maytwitchcraft be a sin, though a witch or a wiar be not mgin the world. The idol isa block of wood or stone; the wizard is a cunning impostor or a half-crzed witling; but both may he instrumental to wide-spread wickedness' Yet surely the Bible is not to blame for either idolatry or witchcraft, as "B. A." seems to insinuate, for the offences
theBible waswitten., g efre
But "B. A" will say, does not the Bible give countenance to popuar error in speaking of witchcraft at all ? The answer i, that the Bible speaks of common things by their common names. It is not tbe province of the Scriptures to teach daemonology sdentifically, any sore than geology or any other of the ologies.
As for the instance adduced of the witch of Endor, it B.A. will look carefully into the account givea in 1 Sami xxvUi, 11, he will perceive that Saul never saw the specttr
of Samuel with his own eyes The appearance of the prophet is reported to hin by the month of another, after the approved fashion of the modern Egyptian necromancer, for an awcount of whome tricks he may coniult Lane, Wil. kinson, and others.
There is no doubt, however, from the Scripture statement that when Saul fell to the earth in a swoon the voice of God reached him. How this was effected is not stated. It might be in the same manner as another Saul, at a later date, heard during his miraculons conversion a messg from heaven,-a message which was understood by hin alone, but ws a voiceless roar of thunder to the bystanders.

I - NEW YORK, MXARCH 14.
Though the important 4th of March, which instals a now President and Cabinetj also ierln{nates the existence of, the House of Representatives and closes the session of Congrecs, yet the Senate, as a' vital part of the Executive Government, continues to sit. The term of some of the Senators expires, and the new members take their places on the 4th, but its functions are not suspended; it does not, like the House of Representatives, break up and disappear from the scene till next December. At the beginning of every Presidential term the Senate suspends its action as a branch of the Legislature, but takes a prominent part in. the imnediate work of the new Executive Government. It has to confim aRl the appointments of the new Administration, to foreign missions, consulships, and the federal offices at home. On al these it has a veto, and does not scruple to use lb. The proceedings of the Senate, therefore, after an inauguration, become very interesting to a large circle ; the President may select from the mass of expectants, but till his nomination is confirmed by the Senate the selection does not amount to an appointment. As yet comparatively few appointments have been submitted to it; the work has not fairly commenced. Mr. Buchanan advocates the principle of rotation in office, and has not merely to fill the places now vacant, but requires time to make the vacancies an adherence to the system of change requires. As the federal officesinthegiftofthePresidentmay be counted by thousands, both tasks are very difficult ; and one is something more-it is very invidious. The persons he will have to dismiss, or who will be required to resign, allbelongto his own party, aud the " ins" do not so fully approve the rotation doctrine as the " outs." Weeks or months will be required for the dislodging process, which must necessarily precede the appointing one. The Senate therefore adjourns this day, it is understood, at the desire of the President, who, besieged at Washington by both "ins" and "outs?'-those who seek to keep aud those who seek to gain-is undergoing a terrible pressure; it is reported that he keeps the door barred rigorously, and is visible only to special friends. No man can have some thousands of offices to give away with inpuuity.
Pending the influx of Presidential nominations the Senate has again taken up the Dallas-Clarendon Treaty, left over to the new ,r-gime. It has again debated it in wecret session, and has arrived at a decision upon it. That decision is ;uterpreted in two ways completely opposite to each other, and the conflieting reports, without some explanation, will be very likely to create confusion and misunderstanding in England. One report states that the Senate, having inserted some amendments removing the objections expresced in the former debates, have ratified the treaty by a vote of 32 to 15. The other report is that by the same vote the treaty is definitively rejected. The real state of the case appears to be this :-Tha treatj is neither ratified nor rejected; but a series of resolutions, embodyiug the amendments desired by its opponents, has been submittcd and agreed to. The treaty, accompanied by these modifications or amendments, will be sent back to the State DepaLtment, and the alterations will be the basis of a new negotiation; Hf they are accepted by the British Goveinment and incorporated into the treaty, the ratification vill follow as a matter of course. If Lord Napier has full power to deal with the question, the necessary negotiation may be concluded at Washington ; this is not considered probable, and it is presumed the matter must be refesred again to London. What the amendments are is not precisely known; they were drawn up by Mr. Jefferson Davis, and accepted in preference to those submitted by the Committee on Foreisn Relations; rumour states they are " not radical," or essentiaUy at variance with the principle of the treaty. It is hoped the worst result of the hesitation of the Senate will be a few months' delay in settlng the question.
Some other treaties have been dealt -with in a much more summary manner. One with the Sandwich Islands, for instance, was " laid on the table," which is rejection pure and simple. A short time since it was announced that a treaty had been concluded with Mexico, by which the United States agreed to advance that Republic a loan of $15PO0O,OOO on the zecurity of a part of its import duties, and certain commercial advantages. It appears that the whole negotiation was an unauthorized proceeding on the part of the American 3Iinister, Mr. El'orsyth, and was a very " entangling alliance " indeed, as it involved no less than fivoe separate conventions, to say nothing of the millions in hard money. This treaty never got as far as the Senate; General Cass has canceled it without ceremony, and sent it back to its author, with a letter intimating that when the United States' Government wishes to contract such obligations it will instruct its representative as to the terms.
To return to home affairs, domestic prospects, and Washington, which is their ceniLre, the present state of the federal city is not one of gaiety. It is thronged by an anxious population; the mere sightseers who flocked up to the inaugur, tion have departed, and the holydayfaces have gone with them. The visitors who remain are mostly of the class that, individually, have " axes to grind," or a personF'l object to obtain; they have a busy, sometimes a tired look, yet no visible ococpation. It is against them that Mr. Buchanan is compelled, in self-defence to close the door, leavisg them to smoke disconsolately on the avenue or gather in the bar-rooms to " liquor" in a serious and abstracted manner; they are anxious, and show it. The Rouse of Representatives is dispersed, and the traders and shopkeepers look gloomily at the close of the season, anticipating a long blank summer, the profitless period they have to meet, like the inhabitants of a fashionable watering-place. Few visitors wi arrive in the dismal interval, and the city will be left to the resident officials and the residents who are not official; the l?st are uncertain, as they may take wing for Saratoga, Newport, or the Sulphur Springs. And just now the resident officials are not in a happy frame of mind. The fear of change perplexes others than monarchs. If the truth could be known, the great triumph of the Democratic party in November last is regarded as involving one of the most disagreeable consequonces of defeat. The "I rotation" principle to be enforced at head-quarters has spread dismay around. Mr. Buchanan did not put it into his "p latform," or he might never have arrived at the White House. It is undoubtedly a good Democratic principle, but good only when Democrats could apply it to Whigs; it is not quite so good when sound Democrats apply it to each other. Now, the party that carried MIr. Buchanan into power is the same as that of Mr. Pierce; the office-holders under the late Pre3ident generally worked hard for the present one; they did even more-they contributed large sums of money, leviedduringthestrugglebyawell-understoodsystem, equal to the voluntary loans of some European States, to which no functionary dares refuse his qusote. The Federal office-holders, in short, were
taxed during the late contest by circulars fro- central committees and other bodies, not the less effective because the law recognizes nothing of the sort. A smart deposit, if the party succeeded, was considered security for another term; and now comes the rotation principle, by which everybody whohas held an office four years is to go out, making way for a Democrat who has not yet served his country. Nothing worse could have happened if the Republicans had succeeded in electing Colonel Fremont. Then a general expulsion would have been natural and expected, for, as Mr. Marcy has laid it down, " to the victors belong the spoils ;"
but victory supposes opponents, enemies, and in this case the supplanters are men from the same ranks with whom the poBsessors served side by side. This is the aggravation , and it will also be Mr. Buchsnan's difficulty,. ie must, to carry the principle out thoroughly, throw overboard a host of active friends and supporters, which will look like ingrati-
tude. The process has not yet been commenced, and a strong opposition to it isinevitable. The licy is very questionable; and it will not gain new supporters, it will not conciliate a single enemy, ai:lit ifl l 21ienate many friencs, The President
may asert his principle, nut he wil cut the thread .of his party, for the new-meirewill lacrificenothingin -the next qonte3t, which i -itue h nitmay, muQ oust them in turn; aud.theeDemocrats at the next elcction will require All their strength to hold their -ground. They had a narrow escape lstb year, and Where is everg indication .that the ,iepublicans are the rising power. It is very probable ir. Buchanan will have to modify considerably the intention reportascribes to him. The system, of "drotsation" has never been swleepingly applied rrhen the succeeding Goverunment was of the same party as its predecessor. The most frequent changes in office are those made in the several States by the pariodical elections. Federal offices held by appointment have a much longer averahe tenure. As to the efficiency of the public service, the last thing to be considered, no one pretends that it would be improved by the strict application of the rotatioa system. The general effect would be exactly the reverse.
A large portion of Mr. Buchanan's inaigural arldress was devoted to a rebuke of the agitation of the slavery quc3tion. Witbin 48 hours after it was delivercd the decision of the Supreme Court in the caie of " Dred Scott " was given, 4nd it has stirred up and renewed the discussion of the subject throughout the whole countiy. Several times has a contiaent hope been expressed that the dangerous controversy had been settled by some combination of things, party and personal. It is so far from being settled that no one of this generation will live to see the end of it. Some are sanguine enough to think this judgment of the Supreme Court a " settlement ;" it ouly begins a new phase of the conflict. It has caused the North an uxnpleasant sensation by creating doubts whether it may not be compelled by law to give the system that aid and countenance it has long volunteered. But the general opinion appears to be that the decision is much less important practically than it appears. Lawyers state that the first decision, excluding the case from the jurisdiction of the Court, makes all the others, as to the constitationality of the Mimsouri Compromise, surplu*age, and of no more value than an election speech, sadly out of place, and especially il-timed, but of no legal vahdety. The Missouri Compromise is now so completely a matter of history and a thing of the past, that to declare it was unconstitutionaUly made is only slaying the slain; no compromise of the kind 'will ever succeed it. The practical -elect of the judgment on this point is about equal in importance to a declaration by the Couwt of Queen's Bench that Cromwell's protectorate was an usurpation. The most distinct points of the decision of the Supreme Court lay down. nothing new in principle or practice. That " negroes are not citizens of the United States" has long been decided by the Central Government, which has never given passports to coloured natives on that account; that negroes are only property is no surprise to South or North; and that they " have no rights white men are bound to respect" is little more than a condensation of the spirit of the Code Noir, wherever it exists. The decision that the Central Government has no power to prevent slavecy going into any new territory leaves the new lands open to a contest or scramble for po3seSsion between North and South, in which, as in 1ansas, the North, as the most numerous and vigorous pioneer, will in the long run have the advantage.

The diplomatic intercourse between the Governments of the United States and Great Britain is no longer one-sided. The two Powers are formally and officially -isible to each other at Wasbington as well as London. The 16th of March was the day rendered wos thy of note by the restoration of the normal state of tbings disturbed by the dismissal of our Minister and the Consuls. On that day Lord Napier was introduced to the President by the Secretary of State, General Cass, and gave in his credentials, with many assurances of goodwill on the part of his Government and congratulations to Mr. Buchanan personally on his elevation to the Presidency of the Republic. The reply of Mr. Buchanan was no less friendly, and the first interview appears to have been satisfactory on both sides. The immediate duty of the new En,lish Minister will not be quite so pleasant; he wiU have to receive the fragments of the treaty that has been blown to pieces by the Senate, and transmit them to London, to try what can be done with them as the materials of a new one. The fact that several Republican Eenators, newly elected, took their seats at noon of the 4th of March had some effect on the course taken on the treaty, and qualified the bitter opposition of Douglas and his section of the Democrats to any convention whatever. In the resumed discussion more reasonable counsels prevailed, and the resolutions at least specify what terms the Senate is prepared to accept, though at last the treaty was saved from total rejection by a very narrow majority. The general object of the amen(lments is to cancel by this convention, as far as possible, the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty, and to refuse any acknowledgment of a " sovereignty' to the Musquito Indians. The validity of land grauts made by them, or in their name, is denied. The law and practice of the United States admit a possession on the part of Indian tribes, but no sovereign right over any part of their territory. Extensive purchases have been made from the Indians of the interior, and large sums are paid then annually as annuities in consideration of their abandonment of such lands, but no grant is accepted from them as lords of the soiL. The United States will not by any treaty place any tuibe of lndians on a different footing. And as far as the welfare of the aborigines is concerned the policy is a protective one. Had grants from Indian chiefs, as sovereigns, been admitted as legal titles the "enterprise" of sharp traders, aided by whisky, would long since have stripped the race of every square mile of their hunting grounds. The transfer of their lands to the Fcderal Government by purchase secures them a permanent subsistence, and speculators must buy of the Government at a price moderate enough when not drived up by competition, but far higher at the minimum than the " untutored mind" would ever ,exract from them.
The Senate adjourned on the 14th for a recess, having confirmed the first batch of the President's new appointments. They were comparatively few in number; others await decision, and the adjournment gives Mr. Buchoanan time to consider them. A President requires great firmness to keep the appointing power really in his own hands, there are so many cliques and delegations from the different States ready to save him the trouble of selection oy producing their candidates. Local political influence is the claim of the party leaders to employment. As it does not always involve fitness for the post sought,
-a quality which must sometimes be considered,-' the selection is often difficult to make. Party iufluence in each separate State regulates-it would not be too much to say dictates-the Federal appointments in it, and the candidates for the more important offices at Washington frequently have a party behlind them too strong to be resisted. The expectants of minor posts come armed with recommendations and testimonials. F9rom both the pressure on the President is very severe. Accdrding to Washin&lon reports Mr. Buchanan is almost worn out by it. The persecution he has to undergo has affected his health. It is said that his privacy and that of the members of the Cabinet
is invaded m the most pertinacious manner. There is no escape possible from the intrusion of the crowd of office-seekers, who are as the frogs in the palace of Pharaoh, pervading the courts, the gateways, and the bedchamber. The rumoured application of the " rotation"
principle has increased the official Ie le
by adding the holders of office to the applicants for it, the former being put on the defensive. It begins to be whispered that the announcement of the principle was a mistake, and that its rigid application will be foLnd impossible. The Southern States do not support it; the party leaders of the South generaUy show more collective tact in political action than those of the North. The South has already every office filled by a good man aud true, thoroughly reliable and sound on the one great question that unites them ; and for any change that would give no increase of political power they care nothiug. The Southern Democrats, therefore, in this matter leave the Northern section of the party to its own devices, and to push each other from their stools as they please. A mnot of Mr. Marcy is in circulation that very well describes the state of things. He has been twitted with countenancing the doctrine by his declaration that the victors have a right to the spoils. This he admits, but declares he never contemplated that the army "should pillage its own
camp." It is understood that the Cabinet itself is divided in opinion on the subject. Severalof its memberj aro opposed to tLe proscription which the

The Legislatre of1hi State of Sew York is sittig it Albany ocidpied in aitending The char., ter of the city.. Though a local question, it is' im.. portant, as it wi3l affect the- government of. the largest city of the Union. .. BY-y6veral Bills an attempt is being made tD establish . more compact system of management iu the cbrporation of the me'zopolis. At pro-sent the city government is a chaos of boards Dnd departments, with independent afnd conicting powerx, between which, though an immense local taxation is levied yearly, the mninicipal affairs are very badly administered. Stricter discipline is becoming ab3olutely necessaly. It is proposed to place the police under the control of commissioners, and to deprive it of its political character, and to gather the powers of other departments into fewer hands. One important change is separating the election of State and city officers from that of the President; every fourth year the two electioas fall on the same day, and the "tickets" of'the State and. the municipal functionaries and the electoral college are " run" together, the same party generally carrying all-the local elections being ewept along with the great torrent of political excitement created by the Presidential election. The State and city of New York have become too important in themselves to be made thus secondary to it, and the day of the local election is to be changed from the 4th of November, that, it may never fall together with the election of the President. The candidates will thus, it is supposed, stand more on their own merits, and the interests of the city will not be merged in another issuethat has nothing to do with them.
At Albany also the fanatics of temperance have resumed their labours. They some time since succeeded in passing a prohibitory law, which proved such a signal failure as almost to cover any attempt to legislate on the subject with ridicule. Its main provisions when tested before the courts of law were declared unconstitutional, the Act could not be enfcrced, and has been ever usnce a mockery. One thing it did effect,-it destroyed the previously existing system of licenses; and, the prohibitojy part of the law failing, the whole result was that the traffic in liquor became 'free, esactly the reverse of the objeot the Abolitionists intended. The city lost a source of revenue, and there was less restraint on drinking than before. The partv, too, lost so much influence from the ridicule excited by the amazing fiasco that the speculating politicians, wrho are ready to join any party that seems to be gaining capital, abandoned it. It cannot attempt such another feat of legislation, but it dabbles with the question still, and wrould be content for the present to " regulate" the sale of liquors by some system of licenses resembling that which they destroyed. Individual members of the party occasionaUy propose schemes of reform which are of the nature of crotchets.
The latest is a Bill before the Albany Legislature establishing a system of licenses for the consumer, instead of the seller ; people are to take out a license to drink, like a license to kill game or a permission to carry arms. There is a nicely graduated scale of fees for liberty to imbibe the various kinds of fiuids :-2s. a-year make a man free of smuall beer and " currant wine," or wines of " domestic manufacture ;" the courage that can venture on the last named liquids deserve6 to be let off cheaply. Strong beer, porter, and ale require a payment of 3s. Whisky and spirits of home distillation are allowed for $1 annxually; brandy and foreign spirits are accessible by a fee of $li. The sliding scale stops there. The next fee is high and inclusive, $5 annually purchases a license to drink bear, stpirits, and wine, or anything, from aquafortis to champagne. The payment of $5 elevates the payer above all restrictions on his beverage. Aldermen and justices of tiho peaco are the grantors of the licenses, and no person can sell or even give anything in the shape of drink unless the applicant produces his license to swallow it, and then only the special kinds specified in the document, such sale or gift to the unlicensed being a misdemeanour. No license whatever, not even for currant wine, is to be granted to a married woman without the previous written consent of her husband. Such is the last legislative absurdity, based on that fruitful source of it, good intentions, when divorced from common sense. While the State Legislature of New York is pestered with such ridiculous schemes, the Fedleral Legislature at Washington, by the new tariff, has just reduced the duties on foreign spirits from 100 per cent, to 30 per cent., the only effcct 6f the higher duty havingbeen to encourage adulteration.
The George Law arrived on the fG6th with the Californtan mail. The feeling of the public asto the repudiation of the debt is described as decidedly favourable to resuming the full liability of the amount. The money stated to have been transmitted to New York in payment of the July dividends has been embezzled or mis3appropriated. The Treasurer and Controller of the State have been impeached by the Legislatare, bit no trace has been found of what has become of the cash. It is supposed it has been invested in some speculation by the officers who had the management of it.
The Washington Board of Health is investigating the cause of the recent singular disease that attacked all the guests of the National Irotel in that city. Twvo or three persons have died of it, and many are still suffering, among them Mr. Buchanan, who was attacked during his stay there previous to his inauguration. A ridiculous story has been circalated of a wholesale poisoning from malice; another that the water tanks were impregnsted with arsenic used to poison rats. The real cause is supposted to be a choked public sewer tnat runs under the house. The hotel has been neatly ruined by the iucident, as it was deserted, even during the late demand for lodgings. Besides this particular visitation, the whole city has been unhealthy ever since the sudden thaw.
Barrack Accommodation In London.
BABRACK ACCOMM(ODATIo ION LONDON.
TO THE EDITOt OF THE- TIMES.
Sir,-Allow me, through the mediom of your columns, to state a few facts iu connexion with the above subject for the information of those concerned.
Wellington Barracks have been improved and enlarged at a considerable expense to the public. They at present afford accommodation for about 1,700 rank and file, and are occupiea by 800, thus leaving room for 900.
Portman-street Barracks, i.c., Portman-street hovels, are still retained by Government and still crammed with troops. This is' contraly tc public expectation, it being generally understood that these barracks were to be got rid of on the completion of the improvements at the Wellington Barracks.
The rooms at Portman-street are inconvenient and very badly lighted, both by day and ni,ht. Some of the married soldiers! quarters are very damp, smoky, and unhealthy, totaly unfit for occupation. The barrack-yard is too small for the uZsual purposes of a barrack-yard. There is no schoolroom (fitted), no regimental stove, no gas ; in short, no anything. The whole Place is crumbling to pieces, having seen its day; brqides, the situation is not suitable for public duties. Then why, in the name of wonder, is this state of t*ings allowed to exist? Good barracks are kept empty to the etriment of the buildings, and bad ones are kept occupied to the injury of the soldier, and at a goodly annual expes,61.
is it not a shame that soldiers are obliged to make their homes amone darkness, dust, and ashes, while a more liberal provision has been made for them by honest lMr. Bu l!, while exceUent room;, with all the other necessary appliances of comfortable home-soldiering, have been prepared for them ?
This may Eeem to soze a very small matter, and it is a light matter in a pecuniary point of view; but is it a light matter to check the growing mtelligence of the soldier? Is it a light matter to drive him out of barracks into low company and into the low pot-house? Or, is it alight matter to drive him from the barrack-room into the canteen, there to spend his pay and to learn habits of extravagance, &c. ? Give him an uncomfortable home, and you do this. Give him a comfortable home, a good library and reading-room, and you invite him to become a useful and intelligent man.
Hoping to hear soon of the fuller occupation of the Wellington Barracks, and the decimation of the Portinan-street, I bez to subscribe mvself

THE Fr?sBnuyE BEsEcTiON.-On Saturday after noon, shortly after the close of the poll for the election of members for Fjusbuij, a fatal accdent happened to one of ILr. Cox's intimate friends. It appears that a gentleman well known n betting circles, named Willson, had been out duting the forepart of the day beating np the electors on Mr. Co0's bebalf, and at the close of the potl got on to a cab, ordering the driver to take hWm to his residence in the neighbourhood of Drury-lane. On his way Mr. Willson stopped at several houses on the road, and made known the intelligenca of his friend having been duly returned. Upon gaming the corner of Endell-street tbe anfortunate man stood up in the cab, shouted out ".Cox for Finsbury-Aurrah!" and leaning overthe side of the vehicle, was supposed to be in the act of giving some instructions to the darver, when the cabriolet turned completely over, the occupant falling upon his head, and the carrriaRe and horse settling upon his head and neck. He was taken to the inirmary, when it was found that his skull was fratured, and in a short time the unfortunate mnan expired.

GLASGOW, DUMBARTON, AND HELEXNSBURGH'
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held on, Wednesday at Glasgow,, Mr. C. Campbell, jun., in the chair.
The Secretary read the report, which stated that the very small balance in the bank on the 31st of January last flUy warranted the call made on ths 10th of February. The funds now available were considered suflicient to completer the L3ne. With regard to the contemplated opening of S pollion of the line in the summer, arangements could not. be made for that purpose, and the directors did not regret. the result, as the aelay would insure the stations and work. being completed with greater economy and consideration. The canital account showed that 136,5771. had been received. and 13431. expended, leaving a balance of 2,2341.
Tho CAraRLum , in moving the adoption of the reports. stated that the original calculation of the cost of the line ws 0, .,foudedonagreementsenteredinto some of the landowners, and, a contractor having ndertaken tha work at th estimated amount, it was reed by the proi-- sion.I committee to give the Edinburgh and Glasgow Company onthird of thervenue of te line on their sub.
expensive contest before committees of both Hoases of Parliament the promoters succeeded in making aprovinal, agreement with Lord Blantyre, which added to the cost of the undertaking so materially that they referred the matter to a racetiug of the shareholders as to whether they would iucrease their subscriptions and allow the directors tOf proceed with the B,il. The shareholders responded to tho apreal, and the promoters proceeded accordingly, and obtained the sanction of Parliament. The cost of a portion of the land exceeded the estimato by 20,0001., including tenants' damaged. He hoped nothing would prevent thek line from being opened for traffic by next spring. The totai suabscribed capital was 207,1901., of which about 3,0001. was. unavaUlable. The actual arrears on aU the caUs amounted now to 8,2C. He anticipated that the funds in hand would carry them on to the end of the year. They would thon,'he hoped, be able to raise money on debentures to complete the line. The Edinburgh and Ggow were providing plant, in conjunction with the Caledonian and Dumbartonshiee, for the working of the line.
Mr. A. Ewvn- seconded the motion for the aloption of the report, which was unanimously agreed to. The rotiri'n
directsrs were re-elected, and the proceedings concludeA with a vote of thank~s to the chairman.
WESTERN OF FRANCE.
The annual general meeting of this company was held in Paiss on Saturday, M. do rEsp6e, the president, in the chair.
The meet;ng, at which upwards of 500 sharebolders were present, having been declared duly constituted,
.de l'Esp6e, jun., the secretary, read the report,
which stateg that, in consequence of the unwilling.- ness of the Government to allow additional calls to bo made on railway shareholders during the past year, owing to the difficult state of the money-market, the works could not be urged on as actively as on former occasions. The section from Iaval to Rennes would be opened for the conveyance of goods on the 15th of AprIl, and for passengers on the 1st of May. The Rennes station had been made of great extent to accommodate the traffic from the Brest, Rldon, and St. Malo lines. The line fromi from AlenZon to Argentan would be opened to the public in the course of the present year. With respect to the lines from Argentan to Granville, Le Mans to Angere, and the thrce railways from Rennes to St. Malo, to Bedon, and to Brest the surveys had been concluded, and the lans sent to the Government for its approval, which woud, it wa
expectcd, be given almost immediately. On the old lines of the Western Company it had been found necessary denrig: the past year to increase considerably the accommodation of the psincipal stations, in consequence of the augmentation tu the traffic; to lay down heavier rails on the two Versailes lines, as now forming a portion of the various great raiways of Normandy andaBritanny ; and to order additional rolling stock-namely, 30 locomotives, 45 passenger carriages, and 602 waggons. On the completion of that order the whole of the rolling stock of the company would consist of 42. locomotives eud 6,441 carriages and waggons of various Iinuds. The sum devoted to new rollin stock during the past year wrs 10,683,116f. (402,7541.), and the whole addi. tion duxing the year to capital account had been 45,8C6,022f. (1,832,2411.), which had been provided for by the issue of bonds. The additional charge for interest on these bondsamnounted for the year 1856 to 3,690,8024 (147,6,32?.) The result of the year's working oct revenue account was less favourable than in 1855 in consequence of a larger amount of goods traffic involving greater expense. Although there had been an increase of 35 per cent. in the length of railway worked, there was only 18 per cent, of increase of receipts. The great influx to the Paris Exbhbition increased the passenger traffic in 1855, and the consuquence was that the expenses in 1856 were compara. tively greater, being 43-15 per cent. against 39.75 per cent. in 1855. The total receipts for the year 1856 amounted to, 38,567,414f. (1,542,6971., and the expenses to 17,929,349f.
1714.,lea.ving a pro4lt on the workin of 20 8.065f. %8255,523 Deducting 13,832,596f. (5513,3t04k) forinterest on loans and the sum paid to the shareholders in October last, there remained 6,805,469f. (272,2191.), being equivalent to 22-50f. per share, which, with the 17-50f. already paid, makes a total dividend of 40f. for the year 1856.
A discussion ensued, in the course of which it was statec
that the new tax on transforable securities was partial in its application and unjust. As to the shares and bonds of the Western Company in deposit, a searching investigation had at once been instituted, and the whole were found to be prfectly correct. (Hear.) The securities were under three
ifferent locks, the secretary holdin one key, the aoting director a second, and the head of the deposit-office tbe third. (A Voice.-" That was also, without doubt, the caseowithtthe Northern.") No, that was not the case; thoshares and bonds had not been so protected for the Nosihern. The probability was that the question would be decided eventually in a court of law, and it would then be found that the shareholders were the parties to be held responsible, eS they deposited their shares of their own free veill, and the directors had used all fitting diligence and not committed any grave fault.
The accounts and dividend were then adopted and thoproceedings terminated.

THE ELECTIONS.
CITY OF LONDON.
A larg coneourte of perzon asseomWed yesterd sy In the dGu#dhall to hear the official declaration of the poDl. Lily jEohn Russell and the Barones de Rothnhild were agaia Iresent. M. Alexandre Damas (aecompanied by M. Delill, of tho City of London Schools) and other foreigners were on the hustings. Atl o'clock LordJ. Russellandtheother suceeasul candidates made their appearance, and were greeted with deafening cheering. Mr. Baikes Currie did not present 'cimself to the electors. After the usual formalities,
Mr. Sheriff MEcai came forward, and made the offlicial declaration of the state of the poll as follows:-
Sir J. Dake . .. 6,634 Baron Rothschild ... 6,39S Lord J. Ruszoll ... ... ... ... 6,S08
Mr. Craword ... , .. . .. 6,E08 MIr. Raikes Currie. .. .. ... 4,619
Mr. Sheriff MECHi doolared that the election had faUen itLpon SirJ. Dake, Baron Rothschild, Lord J. Russell, and Mr. Crawford. The deolaration of the numbers was received wLli loud and pretractc i cheering.
Sir J. DuKE first returned thanks. He trusted the electors would excuse him if he failed to thank them sc¶iciently for the high distinobion they had conferred upon him by placing him at tho hoad of the poll He had entered the city of Loudon many years ago a humble indIvidual ; he had sought to raise himself by industry and integrity, and he conld. not F-d words to express his feelings of gratitude towards his feUow-citizens. He had endeavoured for 2) year to do his duty in the House of Commons, and he uhould continue to do so. He had voted against the nobls lord !J. Russell) with regret, but he did not think the noble lord would respect him the less because ho sometime3 differed froru him. (Cheers.) The electors could not expect th noble lora to attend to their locat duties, bc by working double tides he would endeavotr to prevent the local interests of the city from suffering inconvenience on that account. (Cheers.) He shoutd coutiaue to support the Government of Lord Palmeraton so long as he brought in measures worthy of a Liberal Admninistration. He ahould support an extension of the suffrage ; the vote by ballot, to proteot the honest electhr; and he should continue to give hs aid to any measure for the removr' of Jewish disabilities. Sir James again thanked the electors, and spi.d he should be ready at all times to attend to the intercsts of the citizerq of London(L)ud cheers.)
Baron ROTHSCHILD, who was reoeived with great oheering next retarn-d thanks in a few well-chosen words, and with.. much feeUng he congratulated the electors that 6,400 voters of the city of London had come forward to protest against the deoision of i htolerance end bigotry. If the Attenipt to obt.-ni' religious frec iom in the ensu;ng session of Parliament should fail he should, as he had before stated, plae his se-.t at their disposaL Very few great legislative trlumphs were won without many ef'orts, and he trusted that the cause of religious freedom would succeed at last. (Much cbeoUn-w.)
Lord J. RUSSELL next presented himself, and was eceived with the raue cheering that welcomed him en the day of nomination. He said,-The two gentle. men wbo have preceded me have had ta thenk you for having Leea eleoctd as your representatives, and have had to return thanks for the great number of votes they have received f-om the elcctoej. But that support has been organized by a body which has for a long while exerted j'relf to return Liberal members to the Rlouso of Commons for the city of Laundon. My task is somewhat different, becaumo I have to thank the voluntary efforts of the electors. I have to thebk the electors for supporting me in a spirit of fairness, and wiSh a determinalion to assert the independence of the electoral body of this city. (Loud cheers.) I have to return tbanks, in the first place, to the gentlemen of my committee, who came forward voluntarily, leaving their homes in some instances, no doubt, at considerable loss, and exerting themselves to the utmost with a zeal and an amount of indefatigable labour wbich no purch-sed services could have procured. (Cheers.) I have to thank the gentleman who was at the head of that committee, Mr. Ricardo, who, I am glad to Eee, has been returned as a menmber of the snew Parliament, although he had the mnisfortune to agree with me in the House of Commons on the China vote. I have also to thank mny mover and seconder, and, indeed, aU those gentlemen who exerted themselves so zealously on my behalf. And I have to thank the independent press of the metropolis, which has generaUy taken my part. I speak not of the servile part of the press, but of that independent press which has generally supported nip on such occasions. Above all, I have to tbank that free spirit of the citizens of London that has stood forward to support the cause of freedom of election on this occasion. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, let me -ay nowv that suDerior to any minor question, of extension of the suffrage; of the ballot, or any other of those matters,importantastheyareinthemselves isthemaintenanceof that free spirit, of that love of indepondence which distinguishes the people of England, and upon which aU our iastitutions and all our liberties must ultimately rest. (Cheers.) Let me now say a word, and it shall not be long, with regard to our futureprospects. Hitherto we have had as an excuse from every Minister who has happened of late years to be in power-it was my excuse (a laugh)-it has teen the excusa of Lord Palmerston, and I think it a very fair aud just excuse-that parties were so finely balanced in the House of Commons that it was dificuti
to carry Liberal measures with a sufficient majority to scoure the assent of the other House of Parliament to those rneasures. (Hear, hear.) Now, if it be true, as I hope it is, that the result of this general election will be to give a large Liberal majority in the Rouse of Commons, so large that the Upper House will no longer have any reason on that grourd to rmfuse the measures that may be paw-ed by the other House of Parliament, then that excuse must henceforward fall to the ground, and Lord Palmerston v:'i.
have no such reason to allege for not bringing forward, not SLx or seven or a dozen measures, but such measures, beginr,-ng with one or two of great importasce, as shall show that Ministers are truly reformers, and that nothing but the circumstances to which I have alUuded have hitherto cooled their ardour. (Cheers.) I see some synmptoms of imp-ovement in this respect, because this election has not tunied-the people of the United Kingdom would not allow it to turn-on the temporary question of whetl-er Sir J. Bowring was right or vwong. The nation has had too much good sense to allow itseif to be divided between Bov .ngites and Yehites. (A laugh.) They know that the true distinction is between Conservatives and Reformers, the Conlservatives desiring to maintain our institutions and not to improve thmin, anu liefoimers desising to improve our instiuons and at the same time to prerirve them. Now, gentlemen, we had a specimen in the last Parliament of a very emall measure. it was proposed by Mr. Locke Ring, and we heard in the House of Commons nothing bat objections to that measure; and we were told that if ithad been a largermeasure theobjections would have bean stronper and more d: Yisive. But as soon as there was a quostion of the dissolution ot Parliament it was discovered that they were ia favour of that measure, but it seenmed that there were in Mr. Locke King's BjU which they had never seen, and which I am told Mr. Locke King had never communicated to theme, certain faults and defectsvwhichhad alone prevented them from supporting it. If that be the case they will have an opposaunity in f,e new Parliament of bringing in new mee,ures of their own, in which they can put all the guards and securities whfou tbey can desire, and in which they can insert all the guards and securities that I inserted in a Bill which I introdueed tvo years ago, and then they can no doubt carry it through both Houses of Prrliament. It is in this way that this dissolution of Parliament will be of real une to this cos'ntry. I trust, as I have formerly said, to see the edifice of religious libe-ty perfeeted. 1 trust to see free trade completed by the abolition of some obnoxious duties. I t est that by eeonomv and retresebment we sball be able to spare those additional duties on sugar and tea which tend so much to diminish the enjoyments of the people. (Cheers.) I trust, also, that by extending the franchise to the enlightened, the respectable, and the honest classes who have not had hitherto the benefit of exercising the franchise we may extend stiU further the basis of our representation, and give an edditional X ecurity to our institutions. (Cheers.) Such may be, I trust, the result of this dissolauion. The good sense of the nation has seen the advantage which might be taken of it 'in having anew Parliament, fresh from communicating with the people at large. Gentlemen, I trust that you will in the future see supported by the four members for the city of London mneraures of economy, measures of reform, measures conducive to the prosperity of this great empire. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, a,ain I thank you for the honsour you have done me. I have been exposed for some years to much -obloquy, to much misrepresentation, to much mi'eorstruction of mly motives; but whatever I may have suffered in thiS respect the generous manner in whicb you have come forv;ard to support use at this election affords me full compensation. (Much cheering.)
Mr. CRAWVFORD was recoived with cheers. Re said he had to thank them gratefully for having recorded nearly
6,OGO vQtes in his favour. He did ssot come before them
viith the rame proud antecedents as his colleaties, but he
should enter Parliament with the deteoisination to do justice, loolAng for no other reward than the satisaaction of his own conscience, and the hope that when, io the course of timne and events, he should be called upou to surrender the
truRt they bad confided to him, he should g-i t their appsroval, if not a renewal of theirconfidence.(Cheers.)
MIr. ROWE then came forward to propose a vote of thanks to their late member, Mr. Masterman, upon whose efficient
and faithful services as the representative of the city of london for 16 years he passed a high eulogium.
Dr. SPA rsen secondedthe resolution, which was carried by acclamation.
Sir J. DuKE then proposed, and Baron RoTiscsemsD seconded, avpe of thanks to the Shexf'3 f M echi rcad Kcats,
whiclhwas ,irred and severally acknowledged by those gentlemen.
The assembly then dispersed.
FINfSBUTRY.
An immense multitude of the electors and Ron electors
attendedthe official declaration of the pollyosterday in Clork. enwell-green, and the excitement was much greater than oa -thenomination day. Mr Dancombe and Mr. Cox, the suecessful candidates, as well as the two other cendidates (Mr.
Serjeant Parry and Major Reed), arrived at the hustings separately, before the commencement of the proceedings. M1r. Duncombe's arrival was the signal for universal cheer. niag, waving of hats, &c., but ach of the other candi-

He therefore de-6lared that MIr. Thomai Slingsby Don. combe and Mr. William Cox had bzen duly elected members of Parliament for the borough of Fiosbury. (Lond cheera.)
Mr. DusccosiBe then presented himself to the ssembly amid loud and prolonged cheers, and cries of IIParity of election," and "No 50L. per cent." He said,-Ladies und gentlemen, when I had the honour of addressing you on Friday last you all with uplifted hands and one voice promised me that I should not be disappointc . You have nobly redeemed that promise. The result of the pol just announced gives me a majority which I wiU venture to gaa
wil certainly not be exceeded, if cqualled, by any polt throughout the united eingdom. (Loud chee;c.) And this result has been obtained by the spontaneous exertions of the electors of Finsbury. (Cheers.) I stand not here in the vain expectation of being able by any words of mine to express to you my gratitude for my obligations to you. The only mode in which I can justly recompente your service3 is by ossiduou-ly and faithfully discharging my duties xs your izprczsnta'ive in Parliament. (Chc3rs.) To those gentlemen who have been candidates for your suifrages, and whom I wiP not call my opponents but my rivals upon this occasion, I return thanks for the manner in which they have conducted the election. (Cheers.) With regard to the gentleman 'whom you have been pleased to return as my coadjutor in Parliament (loud cheers, a few hisses, and confusion), it will be my duty to co-operate with him for your benefit (cheers, and cries of "Bravo Parryl' "No liar !" " No buUy !" and " Turn Parry out P") a and, as the forms of Parliament are not learnt in a day-although it is of course the duty of every member of Parliament to make himself acquainted with them-if my experience can be of any use to him he shaU freely have the benefit of it. (Cheers.) I trust that we may not te found voting in different lobbics (upro.r, which Mr. Duncombe endeavou'red to terminato by assuring the assembly that they were quarrd1-ug about nothing at all), as we should thereby nullify each other's votes when the ri3hts and lives of our fellowcounte -men are in question. In aU probability the first question that -vll have to be decided, and the first that ought to be decided, by the new Parliament wiU be whether Lord Pr1merston acted rightly ir. advising the Queen to dissolve Parhiament upon the iesue whether that flag which it has been our constent boast has for above a thousand years braved the battle and the breeze shaU be iusulted with impunity by foreigners and barbarians (cheers), and whether solemn treaties shall be evaded without a proper remonstrance on the part of your representatives in Parliament. (Continued cheering.) 'But accounts, the authenticity of which cannot be doubted, have been received by which it appears that the Emperor of China has thrown over Mr. Comm-usioner Yeh. (Loud cheers.) He has told him that he is in the wrong, and that the Looner he apologizes to Great Britain and tries to conciliate the English the better. (Cheers and laughtsr,) Whether Mr. Commissioner Yeh, that savage barbarian that sanguinary tyrant (hear, hear), will demur to the orders of the Emperor 1 know not; but if he does not obey his orders in all probability, according to tho customs of the country, the Emperor of China will take off the head of Commissioner Yeh (laughter), wrap it up in a calico pocket handkerchief (laughter), and send it to Sir John Bowing as some compensation for those insults which he heaped upon the British flag (much laughter); and as for his bocfy, it will probably be wrapped up in a similar envelope end thrown mto the Canton river. (Laughter.) Suppose Lord Palmerston's Government had acquiesceU in the decision of the Yehite Parliament, in what ahuxniliatingpositionwe should have been. What a degradation it would have been t) find that England approved those proceedings of Commissioner Yeh which his own Empseror disaproved. But, ladies and gentlemen, we have avoided that dMsgrae, and the noble, magnanimous, and high-spirited people of England have scattored tle Yebites to the wind. (Loud cbeers.) Where are they now to be found? Will they appear again in the next Parliament? (Ci:es of " No, no I ") I hope that soine of them may, and that they wil bring the question forwr.rd, and we shall then hear what they have to say in their defence. All that I can say is, that whenever they do bring it forward I shall reneat the vote which has met with your approbation (cheers), and I believe with that of the vast majority of the people of this country. (Hear, hear.) But there was a sect springing up in the House of Commons (whether it was the work of Rtussia I know not) which was constantly saying that whatever Enuland and Englishmen do is wrong, and whalever any foreipner does is right. ("No, no.") It is time that that feeling should beput down. Ishallnowgo beck tomy place in the bouseofCommons and resume my duties as an advocaFe of civil aud reliious hbei ty. (Cheers.) Ishall go back the samereformer as I h.ve ever been. I am tied to no Minister whatever. Lord Palmerston (we have it on the autholitv oZ Sir James Graham) isa Tory of the deepe-t dve. ("li:ear, hear," and laughter.) I do not dispute thaSl Sir James Graham is a vesi,good judge of Toijism. (Lau-hter.) He has ere.

Russll are now bidding for gapularty and calling themselves reformers. (Iaughtrm) Nevertheless, till within the last few hours they oppose d overy motion which I brought forward for extension oZ tho franchi e and Parliamentary refoa.n. They have chanoed. And wby should not Lord Palmerston change too?? 'e is too good a tactician to be beaten by them in foreign or domestic policy. We all know-and he himself must know full M1el -that if he vwshe, to keep at the head of t..e Liberal party, !f he wishes to repay the people of England for the noble supposl that they have given to his Governnusnt on thb'
occasion, he must march with the times. (Ch ,rs.) And, ladies and gentlemen, it will be my chief task to see whether Lord Palmerston, or whoever else may be at the head of the Government, does his duty by defending the rights of the poor and the property of the ricb, and by extending the freedom and liberties of mankind. (Loud cheers.) I now take Imy leave of you, wishing to each of you all the bealth and happiness wbich it is possible to enjoy in this world, (Prolonged cheering.)
Mr. Cox next presented himself for the pr-pose of returning thanks for his election, but the s.orm of hisses and groans from his opponents, mingled with hearty cheers from his supporters, created such uproar durmg the wbole of the time that he stood before the assembly that he found it hopeless to obtain a hearing from any person except the aeporters, towards whom he directed part of his brief observations. Cries of "Paid Canvassers" and "Bribery" assailed him throughout. He said that so great -was the influence exerted aainst bim during the contest that but for the zealous effoils of bis friends, to whom he returned his warmest thanks, he shou'd not have been placed in the proud position of memb^r for the great constituency of Finshury. He was deeply indebted to Mr. Dunnombe for his kind offer to give him (Mr. Cox) the benefit of his Parliamentary expesience, and would never be found voting in a different lobby, because his principles exactly coincided with those of Ir. Duncombe Major Reed had thronghout this oontest acted towards hin in a gentlemarly manner. He (Mr. Cox) had been charged with bribery because he had been assisted by paid canvassers and counsel's opinion had been obtained by his oppanents as to whether such payment was bribery, that opinion beingin the affirmative. But what of that? It was merelythe opinion which one barrister had formed upon the constrna
tioii of the Briberv Act, and he (Mr. Cox) could obtain the opinions of 21) bairisters on the other side. Further, the election auditor had assured him tbat the pa .nent of canvassers was quite alegalandproper charge. Was itnotafact that with reference to the construction of the Metropolis Local Nlluagenent Act the opinions of the Atiorney-Oeneral and Solicitor-C.-neral bad been obtained, and thiat each of them held different opinions upon the question submitted to them? He therefore assured his friends that there need bh no uneasiness as to the threat to unseat him for having employed paid canvarsers. If the threat should be pat into execlution he would meet hls opponents before a committee of the House of Commons. He concluded by saving that if he failed to adhere to his plcdges the electioneering address which he had issued, and of which he requestc I all. the electors to retain a copy, would foo.n their bill of ;udictsment against him. He retired amid loud cheers.
Mr. Serjeant PA1RRY experienced a worse reception than even lt'r. Cox, and, like him, ondeavoured as a lsit resort, but with indiff3rentsuccess, owingto the tromendousuproar
to gain the patient ears of the reporters. He compiained that Mr. Cox had expended several thousand pounds in corruptly influencing the electors, and threatened to present a petition to the lHouse of Commons aga;nst him for bribery. The constituency, be said, had disgraced itself by returning ?lr. Cox to the House of Commons. The slanders which had bcen uttered against him (Mr. Serjeant Parrv) had been investigated by his committee, by whom they were found to be utterly felse. He had notoemployed a single paid canvasser, nor attempted to undulyinfluence the electorsin any =inane . ~eeuran oproa nmst ginstahy
shape. He entertained no personalaimosit agisis opponents. With regaTd to Major Reed, he was bound to say that his conduct had been that of a gentleman, and he therefore beartily thanked him. There would be a new election for Fineburj, and he (hr. Serjeant Parry) was sure to fill the seat frnm which he was detsrmined to oust M-. Cox as soon as Parliament met. Raving thanked his sup. porters he retired amid cheers and hooting.
Major REED was well received, and his short speech was listened to with oomparative patienee. He joined in the complaints of Mr. Serjeant Pany against the return of Mr. Cox, and claimed eredit for having conm'cted himself during the contest in a gentlemanly manner towards his rivals, and for having mnade no attempt whatever to interfere between the electors and the exercise of their constitutional privileges. He had been defeated, but he bad rather be so than be returned to Parliament by bibery and corruption
hlr. DU-5coMu ihoved, and Mr. Cox{ seconded, a vote of thanks to Mr. James, the returning offilcer, for the worthy manner in which he had presided over their proceedings.
The notion having been passed amid acclamation,
Mr. JASIX acknowledged the compliment, and said he r wished to avail himself of that opposiunity of thankin
those gentlemen who had acted under him-viz., the pow clerks, the police, and, last hut not least, the builder (&Tr. Pherrhy, of Hackney), who had with great rapidity erected
the hust s in a most subtantis manner. (Cheers,) The proceedings then closed.
THE TOWER HAMLETS.
The official declaration of the poll was mede on the hustings, Stepney.green, yesterday, at 1 o'clook. Previous to that hour the auccessful candidates, ir. Ayrsh n and
MrnBtler, were escorted, in separate lines of CarriageS, to the place of meeting. Sir ~W. C-lay was also present. The croowd wlas as large as on the day of isomination, and quite

-When the cheering Ihad subsided he sid he bad7frthei to arnnounce that Mr. Ayrton and Mr. Butler were returned as Meprcrent-.tives for the Tower Hamlets in the Commone House of Pari;ament.
Mr. ATRTO, after entreating silenee, referred to the fol. lowingpara--aph in his specru atthenrmiaition, which wic XOpoxI in Tc Timn' o0Z Saturd .y:-

The hon. gentleman said Sir W. Clay had some cause to complain. In ebe excitement of Fridayhe expressedtoo strong an opinioa of Sir W. Clay's conduct, and he wish.d, therefore, to express nowhis great regret that anything should have fallea from him calculated to wound the feelings ef that gentleman. Sir W. Clay's conduct was before the electors, and it was for him, not to comment, but to etate facts, and leave the electors to draw their own conclasions. But for some exciting cause he should have contented himself by referring to their late member's absence upon a division when he thought he ought to have been present, and he wished now he had only said that on an important occasion Sir W. Clay was absent. With regard to Mr. Butler an indiscreet friend had written and published in some newspapers a speech which M1r. Butler was too much of a gentlemr n to have delivered. He should like to se3 the man who would dare to make snch a speech when bhe was standing by his side hearing what he was saying. Having no desire to dictate to the electors what they should do with their second votes, he had persisted in replying to all applications on the subject thathehadnothing to do withtheothertwo candidates. Personally, there was no one with whom he could more desire to sit than his friend ldr. Butler, but, politicaly, he .deplored the result of the contese. To ;vhat cause wae that result to be ascribed? (Ciles " To tho publicans.") No. Itwastosome3menpreferringthec-n;ms of private friendship to the cals of publc duty. At 2 o'clock on Saturday many young men who resided at Hankney, very earnest in their opinions, went, without his cognizance, to Sir W. Clay's committee, and asked Sir william's friends to exchange votes between him and Sir William. Those gentlemen refused, and by that conduct Sir Wiliam had lost his election. The wealthy, easy-going Dissenters gave thei' votes for Clay and Butler, but had they given them for himself and Sir W. Clay the nr'nbers would have been for Sir W. Clay 7,054 and for Mr. Butler 6,800. (Confasion. Cries of " What have you to do with that? You are elected." "SHow about the beershop people I" "Sir William was too Eanguine.") The election of himself was satisfactory in the highest degree, because ng one could detract from the full measure of their triumph by saying that he came in under the protecting auspices of any great or influential name. Many large employers had voted for the old members, but had studiously avoided influencing the choice of those they employed. In the present state of the representation there were places for which gentlemen who had accumulated wealth were elected on account of that wealth and irrespective of pLoitical pz'nciples. [An Elector.-"You have been to Bombay and got a lot of money, end yoe do the same thing."] It was not so in the Tower Hamlets.- le thought their suffrages would be exercised from hi-her motives, and the proud position in which he stood proved that he had rightly measured the in. telligeRce and independence of the constituency. (Cheers.) In conclusion, he professed himself ready to meet them at any time, face to face, to vindicate his conduct, though it would always te in aucordance with the views he had enun. ciated. (Cheers.)
Sir W. CLAY asked whether ho distinctly understood Mr. Ayrton to withdraw the words applied to him on Friday witth respect to the division on the bishops' retiring pensions, and to vhich some suhsequent correspondence referred..
Mr. AYRTOr raid he could not ha more plain. He entirely retracted every expression of his own opinion. He Wished to state the mere 'act of Sir W. Clay's absence' ind to leave the electors to form their own opinions. iii the
aste of the moment he exprersed an opinion, and -he aiow regretted having done so.
Mr. BUTLEB thanked the electors, assuring them that he should conduct himself precisely in the same -way durimg the next Parliament as he had done during the last. He had nothing to look back to with regret. He entertained a conscientious conviction that he had done his duty When he had served five years with Mr. Ayrton he should beas - tinclined to part with him as a colle-ue as he now was to part with his old friend, Sir W. Clay. The election was over. AlR asperity had co-ased, -nd it wouild now be the duty of himself and colleague to do the best they could to promote the ifrerests of the borough. Mfr. Butler shook hands with Mr. Ayrton, and retired armid loud cheers.
Sir W. CLAY said his object in coming there was to take advantage of the occasion to manifest his respect for tho great constituency with which he had been so long connected. He wished to show them that he boweed respectfully to their decision, that he felt he had no right to question that decision, and that, however painful it was to him, he met lit without a murmur. (Cheerm) To the pain of defeat the yet greater pain of self-reproach was not added. They were entitled to form their own opinion as to the men most competent to represent them, but he retired not a dlishonoured taough a defeated candidate h^cause he had faithfully discharged his duty to the best of Lis judg- ment anid had not proved false to a single principle uora
single profession that he had ever made. (Cheers, and ' a Voice--" Stand for Middlesex.' Not less than 10,000 voters remained unpolled. What might have been the result had a larger portion of the electors voted it was idle to inquire. at least they were indifferent as to the result of the election, and must be held as submitting to the decision of the majority of those who did exercise thteir ilght. Having a strong impression that the'feelings of the constituency were friendly towards him, and doubting whether there would be any contest, he felt great reluctance at troubling them too early; and therefore there was a`mo3t a complete want of that organization which ge-. neraly led to victory. It was now a matter of little im. Po l'ance; all that was left for him to do was to tell them that his recent defeat would ne-ver exting ish the deep gratitude which he felt for the confidence they had so long reposed 4u I-rm.

SOUTHWARM.
Mr. Pella'tt's vote on the Chinese question and his conxnexion with the British Bank have been fatal to his claims to represent the borough, the election having resulted in the substitution of islr. Locke, a firm suxpporter of Lord l'aimerston's, for Mr. Pellatt. Sir C. Napier took te leadfrom the commencement and maintained itthroughout the day. Locke early drew a-head of Pe,1att and the latPPOit woich he received during the hours of the workmnen's leisure clearly indicated their strong feeling in favour of the foreign POlicy of Lord P lamerston.

General CODRiTnOro thanked the electors for the support which they had given to him, and for the good humour and fairiress by which this contest hbad been characterized.

Mr. Alderman SA.oioys, who was loudly cheered, said that in addition to the reasons for not conte'ting the borough which he had given on the day of nomination be bad hesitated to come forward because be was not aware of the existeneo of that dissatisfaction with the late members which had evidently prevailed, He hoped that, sooner or later, the obstacles to his sitting in th hous of Commons would be removed, and he should then present himself to solicit their sufifrages.

E3SEX, SOUTIHL
The nomination of the candidates for the southern division of the county of Ez:sex took place yesterday at Chelmsford. The roceedigs eommencedatllo'clock,andthe candidates, Mr.*.W. Bramston, Sir W. B. Smijth (theold members)l and Mr. IL B. Win-field, who comes forward on Libera principles, were escorted to the hustings by their friends. A good many of the tenants of Mr. Bramston and Sir IL B. timijth formed a proceruion on horseback;* but there was no musuic,noor ayny ofthe i ordinary accompaniments of a conbriefly opened the procefedtihnFgs. rF WRroriT,
s:r. J. a . WdatTLXOTON proposed Mr. T. W. Bram. Mr. J. TUFPpENx~ seconded the nomination.
MIr. J. S. Tuoxpsaw proposed Sir W. B. Smijth. Mr. T. KENIBLE seconded the nomination.
Mr. C. T. Towxn proposed Mr. R. B. Wingfield as a fit and piropr pei.on to represent the county. (Great cheering.)
Mr. WISvxRNc, M.P. for Malden, seconded the nominalion o. :Mr. Wjippfield.
Mr. BFsArsToNthen stood forwardto address theelectors, and was received with a good deal of cheering from his own supporters, mingled with expressions of dLsapprobation. was supposed by many that a member of Parliamnent had nothing to do bit to vote according to the directons of the whipper-in of his party; but he had never done this, and he never gave a vote upon any question without a fn]l consideration of the subject, and in a perfectly indepondent manner; and it they returned him, as he believed they would, on the present occasion, he should continue to adopt the same course. (Cheers.) Some of his constituents thonght he was wrong in giving the vote he did upon the China question, but he considered he -was right, and he should give the same vote again if he was called upon to do so. ("Hear, hear," and marks of disapprobation.) As to the general policy of Lord Palmerston he approved it, and he considered that hahad acted in a bold manner when he asunmed the Government during the Russian war, when Lord Derby and Lord John Russell confessed their inability to cArry on the business of the country in the serious dif. culty m which it was then involved. He had therefore felt it to be his duty to give Lord Palmerston his honest support, and from the time of his taking office to the Chinese. question being brought forward he had voted in support of Lord Palmerston's Government. He opposed them on that question, because he believed at the time. and he believed still, that the rashness of Sir J. Bowring had led them into w ar, which was a condition no country ought ever to be placed in, except for-the very stronges' reasons, and when that alternative could not by any possibility bo avoided. (Hoar, hear.) Mr. Brawston then proct :ded to say that he was anxious for the carrying out of evety proper and necessary retrenchmentin the expenditure of the coentry,and for the reduction of taxationr; but he would never consent to starve either the army or the navy, or any of the institutionso the countay. (Cheprs.) His honourable opponent, Mr. Wingfield, expressed himself to be in favour of a repeal of the malt-tax, and he (Mr. Bramaston) should also be very glad to relieve the faTmers of this country from the pressure of that impost, but he could not forget that the late war had left them a heavy biU to pay, and he was afraid that it would be a long time before there was any cbanse of tho malt-tox being repealed. When that time came he should bo ready to support the repeal of the tax, and he had never flinched from stating his opinion that the mr t-tax was a grievous burden to the farmer, and that especially now that the system of free trade was carried out to such en extent he was especially entitled to be relieved from this tax. (Hear, hear.) He had hitherto supportec
Lord Palmerston as an indepeudent member of PaN7ament, and as an independent member he should continue to do so if he was elected. (Cheers.) He entirely approved his opinions in his addrers, both as to his foreign and bis domestie p:licy. (Cheers.) He was diposed to support all moderate and temperate reforms. Mr. Bramnston concluded by thankling the electors for the patence wth which they had listened to theocbservations
e had mnr le to them, aud expressed a confident opinion that they would r_aia return him as their representative. (Chiai.L)
Sir W. B. S311im next addressed the meeting. He had compared hiisaddress uth that of his hon. opponent, Mr. Wingfield, and it appeared to him that there was very little difference 7etween tnem, and if that were so, Mr. Winfield had put them all to a geat deal of trouble for no purpose whatatver. Mr. Wiri'gfield said in his address that he was u anlvocate for civil and religious liberty, but these were mere words that were open to all sorts of constructiors, and he did not believe Mr. Wingfield put the same construction upon them that some of his supporters did. Mr. Winafield also professed himself a supporter of the Protestant &iurch, by which he meant, he supposed, that hewould support her endowments. He also went further and said that he would support tho grant to Maynooth. His (Sir W. Smijth's) vote upon that question, he was conj to say, had lost him some votes, and he was bound to say that if the Catholics generally were as kind and as t :lerant as those whom he had met with in this county he should be vety much inclined to reconsider the votes he had given upon this question. (Hear, hear.) His opponent expressed his re Ainess to vote for the immediate abolition of church-rates, and he also should be ready to do so if some satisfactory cempromise whereby the rights of the church would be preserved were to be come to; and now that Sir W. Clay was no longer in the House of Commons he thought it very probable that some satisfactory compromise might b e ffected. Then, with regard to the malt-tax, ho had already voted for its repeal, and upon all these questions there really was little or no difference between him and his hon, opponent. The electors were well aware of the political views he entertained and the claims he had upon their support, and he really thought that if there was so little difference between him and his hon. opponert they would on the present occasion take for 'their representative their old tried friend instead of new blood. The hon. candidate concluded by statmg that he had hitherto supported Lord Palmerston. He had voted with the Government in taking the " war ninepence" off the income-tax, and also on the China question, and he had never given a vote with greater satisfaction than the one he so gave, Dnd he should continue to support theOovernment upon all the questions on which he considered they wrere acting for the benefit and honour of the country. (Cheers.)
Mr. Wnqs;coszD next addressed the electors. He was received in a very enthusimtlic manner by his supporters. He said he came before them as a friend to the cause of civil and religious liberty. The present moment he considered a very aunpicious one, on accou,nt o' the news that had just been received of the cessation of hostilities in China, but he said that, although L,rd Palmerston had been charged with being a disturber of the peace, he did not thirk either the French or the Americans, if they were appealed to, would say that he had been so in this Chinese quarrel. Sir W. Smijth had endeavoured to make use of his address and to represent to the electors that their political opinions were similar. He was wiling to lend him his address, but he was sure that he -would never be able to act uP to it, and that it would be no use to him. (A laugh.) What was the conduct of their late representatives upon Mr. Locke Ring's motionafor extending the suffrage to 101. householders in counties? (Hear, hear.) SirW. Smijth said he would never vote for such a measure, as it would lead to Republicanism. (A. laugh.) Upon the subject of the reduction of taxation Mr. Bramston, who he really believed was actuated by honest intentions, said that the duty on malt could not be taken off on account of the financial difficulties of the country, but thWs was the very reason, to his mind, that it should be taken off, because it was well knowa that the reduction of duty upon articles of gereral consumption greatly increased that consumption, so as to make up more than the deficiency, and thus the working cla-ses were benefited by obtaining what were luxuries to them at a cheap rate, and the Government was benefited by the increase in the Exchequer.
A show of hands was then taken, which was declared in favour of Mr. Wingfield and Mr. Bramston. A poll was demanded on behalf of Sir W. B. Smoijth which will take place on Thursday, and after a resolution of thanks to the JEUgh Sheriff the electors separated.
_ ~~ROCHESTER.
The nomination of candidates for the representation of this city took place yesterday in the GnildhalL
Captain SAVAGE proposed Mr. Philip Wykeham Martin, one of the late membnrs.
Mr. J. FoosD seconded the nomination.
Mr. S. STrELE proposed, anm Mr. Wnxui seconded, Mr. Serjeant Kinglake as a thorough Reformer.
No other candidate being proposed, tho MAYon declared these gentlemen duly elected amid loud cheers.
Mr. P. W. MARTST returned them his most heartfelt thanks for having the second time re-elected him as their repre-entative. The present appeal to the country had in reality nothing to do with the dispute with China, for happily, by a telegraphie despatch he had just received from Paris, that question was settled. The question which coneorned the electors more than that or any other was, what Ehould be the domestic policy of the Government for the next seven years. (Cheers.) Undoubtedly during that time great and important questions would come before the Iegislature, and he shotuld be prepared to give his support to every measure of practical reform. (Cheers.) He consdered thatan agreement had been entered into that the iconmo-tax ehould not be continued after 18S0, and he should therefore oppose any proposal that might be made to extend it beyond that period. The present representative system was full of inequalities and injustice, and he h ould support any measure having for its object a large extension of the suffrage. (Cheers.) He was entirely opposed to church-rates. kCheers.) He longed for the time to a'uive when every child r'lould be properly edicated, even if they adopted the American system, where they managed to give every child a religions andsecular educat'on wthoutquarrelling over it. (Hear, hear.) It would be WR pride and pleasure to be in every respect the repreEentative of all cisses int that city, and he
trusted that at tho end of the approaching Pmrliameht they wou,ld again confer the aame-honoer nponjhien v Cheers.)

Mr. MARuNX then proposed, and Mr. Seresant KRwaLAxE seconded, a vote of t"anks to the Mayor, which was heartily responded to.
It is 26 years sinco an election in this borough has pas3ed off withou; a contest.
MAIDSTONE.
The official declaration of the poll was mado at the Town. ball yesterday morning, when the Mayor declared the numbers to be as follows:-
Hope ... ... .... ... ... ... 801 Scott. ... ... ... ... ... 759 Lee ... ... ... ... ... 689
Mildinav . .. ... ... ... 655
The two successfui candidates, Mr. Beresford Hope and Captain Scott, subsequently addressed the electors at considerable length. By this election the Opposition have gained two votes, but there is not the slightest donbt that there will be a petition, the grossest corruption having prevailed throughout the contest. The Liberal candidates, r. Lee (the late member) and Mr. Elldmay, have issued a Joint
address in which, after stating that many of the votes pledged to them were given totheir opponents, they say-
'The cause of this serions defection as no scores, But wo refrain on the present occasion from alluding to the ublie scandal further than to state that it has been accomrdished by agency the most immoralt and that the proceedwugs in qUeCtiOI will Vwithout doubt De made the subiect of further inquiry." The borough contains a large number of freemen who have always been found to be influenced by pocuniury considerationsY.

Mr. LocEx KING was received on rising with much cheering, and, after thanking the electors, said he did not feel it necessary to enter into any lengthened exposition of his political sentiments, as ho believed they were so well known. One of the great que6tions to be discu-lsd in Parliament was, were they to have reform or not? He had repeatedly brought forward the subject, but it was only considered to be so much political capital, and did very, little god; but at length he was determined to try who were real Reformers and who were not. The fact was glaring that at Reigate a person having a lul. house had a vote, but at Croydon he could not vote unlessb ho bad a 601. houso. In 1851 he (Nr King) brought in a measure for reforw.,. Government divided upon it and re.igied. In 1853 Lord Derby came into power, and tho Bil wrs shuffic1 In tho sam. year Lord J. Russell promised -to bring in a rmeasure of reform;' in 1854 war broke out, and that was made the excuse for putt:ng it off; in 1857 he (Mr. King) brought it forward again. Lord Palmerston opposed it, and on asking why he did so Lord Granville siia th6 Bill was framed in such a way that it would ha impossible to engraft the Government amendments upon it. Now, that was an untruth, for thoro bad been no Bill brought in at all. The hen. gentleman, in reference to the law, said with one dash of the pen he had erased 150 obsolete statutes, which had been, asa, member ocularly remarked, dlsnoring" on their shelvea.ready to to worked up at any mnoment. They mi-ht not be aware that there lied (till be had been the m'anq of its repoal) been a law in e.dstence enacting that a man should not keep more than so many sheep; and another that no n an ushould have more than one farm. Then there was. another lawv affirming that no man should wear anything besides me' a buttons, under a fine; another that he should only wear silk buttons. There was scarcely a man in the room but would be lIable to be fined for his buttons if that lawbhd continued. The hon. gentleman said he hadnofactiorsopposition to make. When Lord Palmqrstvn was right he would suipport hins, but if wrong he would opposeohim. (Cheers.)
Mr. ALCOCK said one goodthihq was at least accomplished by the dissolution of Parliament; it had brought aUl tEo members of the House of Commons to the bar of their constituents, ar.d he could assuro them it was no light or e:.sy task to be asked aI. that a member had done in the House of Commons for the last five years, and all that he thouoht or meant to. do for the next five or seven years. ith regard to his vote agains' Lord Palmerston he had listened to the debate with the greatest earn, anA hoped to eso,pa voting at all, but he ,ould'iiot. He had nothing whatever to reproach himself for on account of it. He had voted with very niany men of great talent and ability. He was sorry his constituents did not approve the vote he gave that, however, he could not help. le had done what appeared to hini to be ajust and right. Tho hon. gentleman said he thonght there was a great amount of misconception and unnecessary alarm raised by a tslk of "conspiracyapainst Lord Palmerston." If any man had opposed Lord Palmierston fromR faction they ought to condemn him, but hc hop:d the innds of the ptople would not be divert:d from real refor,o and retranchfnent by the cry of a " conopiracy againseT Lord Pplmerston." The hon. gentleman taid, he hoped we shonld soon have universal peace, and that then the new Parliament would set itself vigorosly to improve the condition of the nation. With re3ard to the Maysaooth grant ho was opposed to it. He advocated education among the people, but had not much faith in reformptory schooIs. Thse hon. gentlemass, hpving expre'sed al opinion in favour of an alteration of copyholds, refe.red to the improvements in farming. Formerly5 when he had talked to them about guano, steam thrazhshmnasachines, and otber improvements, they Iaughbd at hin, but now they couLld not do withonit such things, and he hoped very roon to seo the stoam principle in ue in Surrey, which had been tried and found to answer well. He would givo no pledges, except that he would do his duty to them to the best of his ability. :30metimes people had told him they could neither drive him (Mr. Alcock) with a whip, nor a curb, nor yet a snaffle. (Laughter.) He could tell them the only biidle -nd saddle they could drive him with was that of reason and conviction. (Hear.) He had said the task of a member of Parliament was a diffcult one to please all. Some' imes it had been objeced by some, " We can't find any foxc-u in your covers when we come out with the hounds; we wilU turn you out for the county." (Great lughter.) Tho hon. gentleman concluded by thanking them aaU for their kindness.
Mr. KING having propoced, and Mr. ALCOCK seconded, a vote of thanks to the Sheriff, which being catlied unanimoualy.

NOTTINGHAMSHElEE (SOUTH).
The nown*ation of candidates to represent th;s division in Parliament took place in the Town-hall, Nersark, on Monday morning, the late members, Mr. W. H. Barrow and Viscount Newark (son of Earl Manvers), being re-elected without opporition.
MIr. BARROaV, in returning thanks, said he accepted the honour at their hands as a proof that his constituents absolved him from b,'s actuated by any factious motives in the vote wihich hb eaa given against the Government on the Chinese question. He remained a Conservative in rinci ple. Conservatism consisted in presorving our consiuntion in a state of efficiency by adopting all those progrcssive improvements which the change of circumstances and the advance of knowledge might suggest to them. Heocondemned the indeceDt haste with whichsome measures of greatpublic importance-had been forced upon their consideration, and maintained that if any Reform Bill were proposed ono session it ought to be printed and circulated among the constitaencies, so that they might give their opinioan upon it b3ore it " as brouglht up for discussion by Parliement in the following seL ion. Ihe question of second-ry punishments was now exciting a great deal of attention, and he wes desirous that the expaeiment of reformatory schools horld bo tried in the fullest and most efficient manner. He was auxions too that means should be adoptzd for giving to all the juvenile populatioo a good, sound moral aInd religious education. He was veryvanxious to retrench the public expenditure, which he thionght bad become very extravagant, hut he saw veiy little hope for the remission of the incomc tax if the war with t:hina were procoeded with.
Eord NEWMSIC adso warmly expressed his acknowledaments. He thouglit that Sir John Boring and Sir Micha`l Seymour were right in their proce fings. and he w, c conhrmed nthis opinoion by the verdict in their farou- vhich was pronounced by the represent%tives of o:l.er foreign Powers on the spot. He was as much a friend to liumauity as any one, and thought that a blow struck a' the beg*nnii;
would be in means of economizing hard blows in the futere. For these reasons he abstained from votirg on the qucstion when it came before the House. He was unwUiling i o vote against the Governnment, which had upheld the honour and
interests of England, and equally uniDWlling to vote in op-i position to the pai ty wixth whom he nsuallg a-ted.

- Mr. T. UseriRs of Canterbury, nominated Sir Brook William B idges. Mr; I. 3HrTiroN seconded the nomination, Mr. DzEDES addressed the electors amid agood deal of Interruption. He had swerved from no principle whatever ht he profossed when first electod for that constituency in
7. He had given the Government of the day his indeendent sapport when he believod the measures they ware ntroducng vwere for the best interests of tho conntry at large. He voted for the Sebastopol inquiry. He voted for the loan to Turkey, and, with two othors on his side of the House, saved the Government on that occasion. Ho had AIWAyS voted for a measuro on its merits, and supported the Government when he could conrcien. tiously do so. Ho was not in favour of Locke King's motion for a reduction of the county franchise from 5I1. to 101., but he would be in favour of a reduction to 20t., which would give a considerable addition to the county franobise. With respeot to the Chia question, no one would say it wss not a most difficultone, (Fear, hear.) He voted aCain
the Government, because he firmly believed then, and still did, that the steps that were taken by the British anthorities ; Canton were not justified by the circumstances that occurred. As to the future, he would give no pledge'. He then gave an ontline of bis views. The firstthing wvold be to reduce the expenditure of the country to what it was before the Russian war took place. He was opposed to the ballot. He wished to have the subject of church-rates sett'ed satisfactorily to all parties, but he couldnot supportthe pioposal of Sir W. Clay for their entire abolition. He was oppoaed to the admissou of Jews to ParliBaent. (Hisses.)
.E. U. DZRIG, on behalf of his father, Sir Edward Dering, stated that the hon. baronet had been abroad for the benefit of his health, but that he had now recovercd, and if again elected would be able to resume his Parliamentary duties by Easter. He would give a general and independent support to Lord Pauerston. L"We wont have him; he hr s betrayed us."I He was a stanch friend of those great principles of internal progress essential for the welfare and prosperity of this great country.
Captain AcHErsox addressed the electors at some length in ex lanation of his viewe, which, he said, were strongly Liberi. He wasopposedto the balot, butiafavonr of Locke Kingi'smotion for theextensionof the franchise. He was in favour of the abolition of church-rates. (Applause.)
Sir B. BcnoDss said, he would never shxabk from any posi-ion he might be caUled upon to occupy by Ihis brother freeholders. He did not expect co be a candidateit was not at his sugge3tion-but if it Nas the wish of the majority of freeholders p esent he would stand, and, if elected, endeavour to discharge the duties that would devolve upon him to the best of his judgment and ability. (Chcac.-.)
The H1GnSIErenRF then calledwfor a show of hands for the respective candidates, and declared the choice to have fallen on my. Deedes and Sir Brook Bridges. (Applause.) He appointed Thutzday next for the polling.

(Cheers, and some expressions of disappro`lation.)
Mr. B.GuneDoN avowcd himself a progressive Reformer in every tense of the word. (Cheers.) He waS convinced. that our froe institntions could not be maintained iu health and vigorr without snuh occasional revisions aud extensions of the francbise as the altered eircumstances and incre'sbd intelligenco of the people mrhbt from time to time require. (Hear, hear.) He should give an independent supporb to Lord Palinerston, as he considered the country oweI a deep debt of gratitude to the noble lord for the enorgy with which he conducted the late war and bronuht it to an bonourable conclusion. Ho lamented as much as any man the recent hostilities in China, hut he could not approve ths late vote in tha House of Commons.
Mr. A. I,AtoD, -who was received with loud cheers, entered into a lengthened explanation of the i-eutnstances under which a compromise had b. n negotiateui. between the Liberal and Conservative leaders of the division, He complained that h;s claim as an old chainpios. of Liboral principles had been unfairly put aside by tho Earl of Lelcester and other leaders of the Wh;g party.

Mlr. BrRcH having withdrawsn his nomination of Mr. Haniond, with that gentleman's consent,

Mr. DEx: r:ox then came forward, and thanked the electors and non-ekeotnmj for the honourthey hadeonforredupon him for the fov-th tifne. He alluded to hs9 conduct i n the late Par1-ament, obhee sing that he had rlways ackd independently, and should continue to do so. He wov'd not b;id himself to suppoct Lord Pal-nerston, Lord John Russell, Lord Do-by, Mr. Disrasl;, or any other Minister iurther tbani he believed that the measures they brought forward were for the interests of the conatry. He vindicated the c mrse Lord Palmerston took in reference to Mr. Cobden's motion, and his subsequent appeal to tho ecOutry, observing that be believed that if the vote had to be taken now by the same Parliament it would be reversed. As to taxation, he expressed himself in favour of reducing the taxes on articles o, domestic consmption, as far as the Chancellor or the Exchequer could aford and the efficiency of the naval and military services would allow. He should not object to Par-
almentary reform in aacordance with the px;uciples of the constitution, but would not pledge himrclE to support any measure until he know what it was. He said he was opposed to tbo ballot, and expressed himself in favonr of at extersion of the present system of educational grants.
Lord GODmRICCH, on presenti Ig himself, was wvalnly cbeered. Ho declared hmnself a warm adberent to those great progressive principles which had ever bt -n held by the Liberal party, aud was therefore favourable to an extension of Parliamentnoh reforia both in the counties and the boroughs. He should nlqo s4aoport carrying out the great principles of freo trade and a reduction of taxation so far as was compatible w:th national safety. As to Lord Palwerston, he had always given that nobleman his support, except when his Lordship Went into the lobby with the Totles on Mr. Locke King's motion and on Mr. Cobden's motion, believing that to have mapported the Goverement on the last quest-on would have been to support a most dangerous prece lent. That suppoet which he had given Lord Pa"ccorston in the past he should continue to give him in futuro. He suppocLod Loid Palmerstonr's foreign policy generally, and taid that he desired that England should be inclined to peace, but always
prepared for war. He declared himself in favour of the allot, and for tho removal of all rer,uants of laws whiuh p revented Dissenters from being placed on an equality asth. Uburchmen.

HEREFOKDSHIRR
The nomination took plac yesterday at the Shire-hall. The three late members, Ir. King King, Mr. Booker Blakemnore, and the Hon. Captain Hanbury, solicited re-election in the Conservative interest, and Sir H. G. Cotterell, of Garnons, was brought forward by the Liberal party.

SiruxGzstroRD HosymNs pIropsed, and Mr.H. ILz WL.IR.s: seconded. Mr. Booker Blakemore.
'ir. KxVihL DAVIMS, of Croft Castle, proposed Captain Hanbury, and the Rev. JoHN HOPTOT seconded the nomi. nation.
The Rfight Hon. Sir G. C. LwIs, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, presented himself amd deafening applause to nominate Sir Henry 0. Cotterell. Li the course of his address the right hon. gentleman referred to the balance of party which had subsisted in Hlerefordahire for a long period up to 1852, and expressed his convction that since that time, wen three Consetives were elected, a large and influential body of electors were unrepresented in Parliamiernt. He referred to the prevalent eleoctioneering cry in 1852, and called upon the Conservative candidates to say whether the great experiment of free trade had not, s he bad then predicted, eeen productive of vast benefit to the country, an onsequently that the dismal propheieesof utter ruin to the agricultural interest had altogether proved untrue, He therefore now asked the electors torestore the balance in the representation by the return of SirHenry Cotterell
The Rev. A. CiavE econded the nomination.
Ilr. KIN KING first addressed the electors. Hisaddrea was little more than the urging of his claima to be ain returned, on the ground that he bad faithfully adherca to his political principles, which were still uchan ed
V r. BLAxxsonE submitted to the eletors tha he was enititled to renewed support? on the ground that he had faithfully discharged his dautias with that liberty and indegendence of action which a representative ought to possess. ie had suplorted Lord Pshuerston!s Government when his conviction hbd assured him that ho ought to do so, and had supported the Chancellor's budget, which he thought a safe and pradent one.
Captain HNBuRY followed. He gave Lord Palmerston credit for what he had done, but did not consider the peace very satisfactory, and claimed for the Conservative party the credit of having given a generous and honest support to the Prime Minister at that crisls. He reviewed the opinions of Lord Palmerston on the county franchise, the churchrate, and other questions, and argued that Sir Henry Cotterell, as a true Liberal, could not be a supporter of the Prime Minister, who was the Tory chief of a Radical Government.
Sir HxNxy Cor-rniLx announeod himself as an independent supporter of Lord Palmerston, and retorted upon CaptainzHanbury that, by the omiselon of the word Independent, he had misrepresented his plitica principles. He wa a true Liberal, in favour of the extension of the suffrage and settlemaent of the church-rate queto,sh t pledgin himself tovote for or against its Rto atal aolition. H he been in Parliament he would have voted for Locke King's motion, and with Government on the (China question.
The show of hands was declared to be in favour of Sir Henry Cotterell (who had an immense maiority over the othe candidates, Mr. King and Mr. Blakemore). AU was demanded on behalf of Captai lHanbury, whch es place on Thursday.

Alluding to church-rates, he saia he was unwilling to force the payment of those rates against the conscience of any one h but he maintained that churchrates were as complete a debt upon the land as tithes, land-tax, or any other legal charge; and he could not consent to abolish unconditionally the rates by which SW0, 00e1., or 400, 0001. a-year were raised and the fabrics of our ancient churches repaired. The extension of sound religiousreducation, the reformation of juvenile offenders and the treatment of older criminals,were ll subjects whioh would come under the notice of the new Parliament, and, from whatever quarter they were produced, they should have his best attention.
Three cheers were given for the members and for Sir IRobert Carden, the new member for the city of Glocester -who was present, and the large assembly which was composed principally of country gentlemen, dispersed.

He haed alay supported the MSinister in power wvhen he thought him righs, end opposed him wfhen be thought him wrong.

Mr. S. ESTCOURT also addressed the electors, observing that his course had hitherto been and would continue to be thtt of a Conservative. He had thought it his duty to give his general support to the present Government, believing they were the men best calculated to carry on the affairs of the country. Hle should go into Parliament unfettered and bound tonoparty. Withrespecttochurch.rati
he did not think as many did, that they were a burden to Dissenters, nor could he listen for a moment to the question of their adjustment. All that was required to be done in tlia way of legislation with respect to church-rates was to obviate the disorders and the scandal which took place in the voting at vestries, and to limit the anount which any man in one year should be called upon to pay. With reonect to the national church, he thought the State ehould "diow it to draw up those rules for its owvn manaement which were indispensable to uniformity of system. lie was opposed to the ballot, but, with respect to the elective frauc(isse, be cared naot how low the qualification was carried, provided the voter possessed such a permanency of tenure In his occupation thb he _was not hable to be turned out of It.

InDTDIE9F.Y
The metropolitan county, the representation of which went begging after the retirement of Mr. Bernal Osborne, now promises to be the scene of a fierce contest. Yiscount Chelseahas rather tardily entered the field as a Consorvative candidate, but his cause has been zealously espoused by fome influential members of his party, and they appear likely to make Up by vigour and earnestness for their pre. vious ipaction. Lord Cholsea claims the suffrages of the electors on several grounds, among others that be has voted against the grants to Maynooth, and also against measures having a tendency to infringe on the due observance of the Sabbath. He claims credit for having given Lord Palmerston a disinterested and ungrudging support during the war; but he disapproves an aggressive foreign policy and " cannot allow that, in return for the eneW he W. played in the conduct of the war with Rwuia, Lord Palmer. aton is entitled to that pledgo of blind and unlimited

He proms es to give rd Palmerston's Government a heartY. general support, and to pay especial attention tO meansares of moral and social improvement. Mr. Hanbury is an advocate for the extensionof the fnchise,butpirV serves a slence in his address relative to tho ballot. he
Liberal candidates appear to be aware of thecommon | dange to which they are exposed from split oe,ad it would seom from the names of Grosvenor and snbuby being printed in the same plzacard, ana from other symptoms, that the two Whig cadidates have coalesced in order to secure their joint retn. The election will takeplace at Brentford on Thursday next.
A numerous and highly estble meeting of the lectors of this county, composed of the inhabitants of Old and New Brompton, Chelsea, Kensington, and Fulham, ws held last evening at the Riding-school, Fulham-road, Old Brompton, for the purpose of hearngLord B. Grosvenor and mr. R., Hanbury, jun., explain their political opinions.
Kr. RxlJilL, wh'o occupied the chair, baving inxtroduced the two candidates to the meeting,
Lord R. GROSvEwoR commenced by ating his reasons for his vote on Mr. Cobden's motion on the proceed. logs at Canton (which have already appeared in his pblished address. Ee then ped on to the Sunay Bill, the mention of which was received with su
lou an log cntiuedhisses, that the chairman wasz obliged to rise toppeas the mneeting. When order had been restored, the noble lord said that at two meetngs, in the Tower Hamlets and at Brentford, he d explained his conduct satisfactorily, and he hoped that he should now now do so again. (HEisac.) He wa not OIL sd he Irritation which existed, for the whole ofhs propositionL had been grossly misinterpreted, and the press of the country had heldWhm p'to ridicule, and obtained for him the iliwull of the working claes, to whom he had always been most friendly, and in whose behalf he had, over and over again, lifted up his voice in Parliament. He had been represented as a sanctified bigot, a mandlin hypocrite, and a man who would compel the observanc4o±6theSahbath by ActofParliament. (Hear.) Letthem in6wlistentothe whole history of the matter. In the year 1854 soeIe gentlemen came to him and asked him to take charge of a Bil for putting down unnecessary trading on Sunday. Ho said to them that he entirely agreed with them, but that the question had been tried before, and that they had better not attempt it again, as it had not succeeded in the previous instance, and he saw no probability of it succeeding now. They went away, satisfied with his objections, but the next lear they came to him again, and told him that they
ad in the rmeanwhile canvassed the metropolis to ascertain the feelings of the working class on the matter, and ha received from the worling classes subscriptions to the amount ofIs or 6d suh person to oute attemnst
He then told theta that as the working classes concurred in the shuttngu of shops and the abandoning of all trado on Sunday, i ey coud als sure him that the
joritY of the metropolitan members were in favour of t he wouid undertake the bill At the end of the week these gentlemen came back to him with the assrance that the majority of the metropolitau members were in favour of the Bill and he then stated that he would undertake the charge of it, on condition that two of them put their names to the back of it. Could he have done maore to ascertain the feeling, of the people ? (Hear, hear.) Ho had accordingly intro. duced the Bil, and he did not think that he could well be blamedi for having brought it forward when there had been six petitions for it, signed by 6,500 persons, and it had been supported by all the metropolitan members with the exception of one, who stated that his constituents were so divided on the sebjeot that he was compelled to vote against the Bill. ("1Williamsh No, it was 1r. Wilkinison, a good member and a go mnan in every respect, and who he was sorry to see had lost his seat. With respet to reform in Parliament and parity of election, had always been in favonrof extension of the sulage, and had mended three clauses in the Bill for corrupt practices, and had 8Uo ceeded in makidng all treating illegl n nlmtn h polling in counties to one day. is oni onlthe ube
of church-rates had undergone some modification. When first elected, he thought that he never hould have voted agyainst them, but when he saw by the centSUSo 1850 there were no less than -5,000,0O3 Nonconformists who paid to the established church hut at the same time supporte their own by volutntay subscriptions, he felt It hIs duty to show some public mark of respoect to them, and he would hAve the rate not compulsory, but optionaL. (" Oh, oh! " and laughter.) He was in favour of te equaliiation of poor-rates throuhout all the districts of the Metropolitani Boartd of Wrs Chee.) ("The Balot? " When he was first elected 5 was against the ballot; but finding that it was a subject intereeting to his constituents, be bad tried if he could not convince himself. (Laughter.) He thought that the beet thing he could do was to examine how it worked in the United States, and from what he had read In hooks and heard in conversation from Americas his nind was made up against secret voting. (Cries of "1Bravo l"hsss and. "-Three cheers for the ballot ! ") The bllrot was incurably evil; it was radically falso in principle. It made a politician irresponsible, ahid he had llve too long not to know that o aan was fit to be trusted with Irresponsible power. The noble lerd then proceeded to Iv other reasons ainst the ballot, which created much diturb nce, in the midst of which his Lordship resumed his seat.
A WOP.EXn MxN asked lord R. Grosvenor, if he were returned to Parhiament, whether he would reintroduoe tho Sunday Bil which had produced such disturbance in Hyde Park last year (great applause, distuxrbance, and cries of "Order I) and vote for the closing of publchouses on
IordaR. GRosvEoR replied that he should have a sces of courage amaounting to foolhardiness If he were to biDng In such a BIl again after the little encouragement he hd received in 1855, when his motiveahad been misropresented, his windows broken, and himself made a subject of opular and comic songs. (Laughter.) He would not vote or the shutting up of publichouses on Sunday.
In replyto Mr. DOWrMrG, he pledgedLhimsnelf to suport ifor makhingRensington, Chel, Fulham, and
Brompton a horough separate from the county.
Mr. PR. HAXBui}Y then came forward and stated his political pinions, which were in substance imilar to those which he" has put forth in his address.
Lord R.. GRosyxiros, In reply to questions from Mfr. GArzrM and other electors,declarea himself unfavotir-ahieto triennial Parliaments, and could not pledge himself to vote for Lord John Russell's promised Reform Bill untU he knew its contents, nor to bring In a Bill for enfranchising Kensington, Brompton, Chelsea, and Fulham; but would be very happyto &ai himsef of the first favourable opportunity to get them mado a soparato borongh.
Mr. (ODDnxeGZ then moved, Mr. W .'SOlT seconded, and Mr. DZLANXY supported a resolution, which was carried by a majority, to the effect that Lord B. Grosvenor
and r. B. Habuyjn, were deserving the support of the constituency, and that the meeting pledged itself to use every exerton to secure their return.
The usual vote of thanks to the Chairman brought the proceedings to a close.

BELAST (Bosto oU ).-It is clear from the tono of the popalar journals that there are but faine hopes of displacing the two late Derbyite members. The Whig of Saturday says:
" The aoies which km attended the csaraes of Mem-n Walean and Ferguson, the Liberal candidates, ham been retmarkable and ghati. fYing-remarkable when the infamous condition of the burgus&roll is condidered and grttlifng in no] ordinary degree sa having been the maesus of educing a great IAberal euthusilm, and as haigr

CLAItE(COTTY).-Privataletters frompartles conversant with tho state of public feeling in the county aesert that the return of Lord Francis Conyngham and Mr. Luke White may be considered quite certain. The former, It may be recollected, was rejected by the great meeting held at Ennis on Wednesday, and the preference given to Mr cott as the fitting colleague of M1r. White. Neveithelesr, the Conpnghax interest and the general ponularity of the family are likely, it I said, to overpower opposition.
DROGIMDA.-At the eleventh hour Captain A. ML Moore, of the 7th Dragoon Guards, hes addressed the elec. tors. The other candidates are Mr. )rCann, the late member, and Mr. Brodigan. A sharp contest is expected.

ExM3S (BOROUGoL)-It appears that lr. George Heny Moore, the Elector-General of Ireland, actually travelled down to Ennis on Saturday with a candidate in leading strings to contest the representation with the Attorney. General. However, matters notlookingpleasant, and being doubtful Of the natUre of his reception, Mr. Moore, it Is aid, did not show, and remained concealed in his hotel til theelection was over.
GALWAY (BosouGH).-(By Electric Telegraph.)-The candidates nominated yesterday for this borough were Lord Dnnkellin, Mr. Anthony OFlaherty, and LieutenantColonel Fench. The show of hands was in favour of Lord Dunkellin. A poll was demanded.
GALWAY (CoUNTY.)-Notwithstanding that Captain Bellew has received political absolution from Dr. WHsle, it ig by no means certain that his sins have been forgiven by the majority of his late constituency. Under such circumstances, Mr. William Henry Gregory, of Coole, has entered the field in opposition to Mr. Bellew, for of Sir Thomas Burke's return there is not a shadow of doubt. Mr. Greo ry is eminently popular with all parties, and it is quite evident from the tone of the Roman Catholi journal, that the Liberal Protestant, if not first, is at all events second favourite. The F'indicatoi-says, '
"We hare no hesitation in sayluz that Mr. Grego saddr Is a rnacl yndfairexpoltieonof hs pdrnciples and oDinions on subject

:KrLM-R.-(By Electric Telegraph.)-Tho nomination took place yesterday-mr. Sullivan and hlr. James H. Devereux being proposed. There was 'no sbow of hands, it is said, owing to the confusion. A poll was demanded.
K1 xiXB Y (COUNTY.)-The run is to be made upon Mr. Seijeant Shoe. The Hon. Mr. Mostyn has been adopted by the ultra-Roman Cathoics, and the hon. gentleman is fairly comnmitted to a contest.
LIIMscru (CouNTY.)-The independent Opoeltionists have secared a candidate in the person of Mr. John George Adair, of Bellegrove, Queen's County. His address is out. Be pledges himself to " ct in conjunction with that party who are pledged to withhold their support from every Go. veranrent not making tenant right a Cabinet measure." Colonel Dickson was solicited to tand, but the gallant gentleman declined coming forward on the present occasion. Mr. bonsel and Mr. De Vere, the late members, are believed so be quite secure.
LSnP.N.-The nomination takes place to-day. The can. didates are Mr. J. Richardson, a relativerof the late member, and also a Liberal, and Colonel Hogg, moderate Conservative.
IIAYO(COU1,M).-The coalition between the Conservative candidate and the pet of St. Jarlath's is now not only admitted, but openly boasted as a piee ofelectioneering strategy beyond aU praise. Archbishop and bishop, parish priest and curate, ave entered into a solemn league for tile purpose of insuring the dowuffae of Colonel kiggins, whose dtfeat, with such a strange combination of paties a yed against him, would oertinly create no surprise.
NwV Ross.-(By British and Irish Magnetic Telegraph.) -Mr. Chatles Townham and Mr. S. Graves, of Liverpool, were nominated. A poU was demanded, which will take place to-morrow.
SL1GO (CouN .-IMr. Swift, like CaptainBellew having received episcopal absolution, is again first favourite with ris party. The other candidates are Sir BR. G. Booth and Mrz. Cooper, Conservatives, and Mrz. Hosvley and Mr. Flanagans, Lihiera'ls. It is not likely that the wthole butch

Blake; but their second votea, it is said, re for either Hasrd or Barren. The constituecncy likely to vote are about 1,050. None of the candidates, except the MWayor, can poll iote than 50)0. Howr the rem;ainder will split their votes we do not presume to state."
WATrEtrOP. (COuiVy).-A second edition of one of the local papers, published on Saturday evening, says -
" We umderstud that the itarqx is of Waterford. Lrd Donougsh more, Mr. William Chris:mas, ao d hTr. J.ms AnAerson, of Grace. dtiu Lodge, held a conference yesterday, with the Tiewof inducing the two latter gentlemen to beco me candidates for the repreeetntiOat

WEsTkYATH (Cor?TY).-bITr. John Ennis does not appear to have responded to the invitation to take the field as the colleague of Sir Richard Levinge. Mr. Ennis, it seems, prefers the chance of wresting the borongh of Athlone from Captain Handeock. One of the late members for the county will, it is believed, be displaced by Sir Richard.

London, Tuesday, March 31, 1857.
LONDOZ', TUESDAY, MARCH 31, 1857.
We beg to suggest to the Administrative Reformers, who have been very busy at many of the recent elections, an invention of tried value, which we conceive will be found admirably adapted for the training of the model legislator. It is commonly called a "tell-tale," and in used in many towns and private mills for the purpose of securing that the watchman goes his regular rounds. Though. universally used and dreaded in the manufacturing districts, it is not so well knowa either in the metropolis oi in country places, and therefore we must explain that the " tell-tale@' every night presents a row of little knobs, which suCcessively, for succesive half-hours, are capable of being thrust in, but at the expiration of their respective half-hours resiat the most violent pressure. If, therefore, the watchman goes his rounds regularly he always finds a knob ready to record his faithful discharge of that halfhour's duty. If he sleeps or loiters, the obstinately obtrusive knob records his delinquency. We claim to put this invention on a par with the ballot-box as the grand means of Parliamentary Reform; for, if the former is tho only means for putting the right man in the right place, the latter wil be not less efflcient in keeping the right man in his place, and keeping him, too, right there. It may be objected that the Division List constitutes a sufficient security, or " tell-tale," for the attendance of Members. No doubt there is much to be said for it in this point of view. Accordingly, the Administrative Reform Association has published an analysis of the Divisions during the last Session, and only waits for the gentlest of hints to publish a full account of aU the 198 Divisions; and nearly as many more for each of the four previous Sessions; how each Member voted in each, and other curious information,
extending, as we are told, to half a million parti- - culars. We will now state in what respect the Division List answera the purpose, and then humbly suggest in what respoct it falls short. It certainly does keep Members on the gqti vive. Taking the Session at a hundred nights, the Member has to exercise his judgment by the act of walking out of the House, or staying behind, on the average twice a-night, and on some nights half-a-dozen times. He has to do this on an immense variety of subjects; some vast and comprehensive; some awful and mysterious ; some nice and perplexing; some painful; some on questions about which he was totally ignorant twenty minutes before, and wil be so in twenty minutes after. The greater the variety the more vigilance required, and the greater probability there wil be of all Members being gradually rounded down into one sound constitutional type, and being aU one as good as another-neither better nor worse. But, in all due submission to tho modest Mr. RoEluucK, and to the industrious Mr. GASsIoT, who has published a small instalment of facts on the subject, without the " tell-tale" the Division Lists must ever be a very impecfect test of attendance. Why, the China debate lasted a week, and led to only one division. What was to hinder a man from taking his pastime every evening, and only dropping in at the last moment ? It is generaly easy to take a pretty long sight of a House, to know who wants to speak, how long they usually speak, and how long you maybe safe fromaDivision. Yet, if it is necessary to divide, d fortiori it is necessary to hear all that can be said on a subject, for without this your vote is not good for much. Thus a " tell-tale" would be a regular test, whereas the Division List can only be a most irregular an& most uncertain one. A large proportion 6f Members, with an economy of time and atten.- tion at least very natural if not always defensible, spend their evenings at their clubs, till they are summoned by the electric bel;innouoing a Division, when down they rush just in tima to. divide-it is not always necessary to know on,what side or even what about, till they read all aNoutt itin the paper next morning.
When the good people of England are toa there have been 198 Divisions in the Session of 186 alone, they will be at a loss to know how. !zo many biWs.could be got out of so very few. 'aherries. So on tiiis subject we will atwempt to. 'enlightax, them By far the greater part. Qt
these UmiskimA were on privato Bills, lb-cli
Bills, Irish or Scotch Bils, when it is usual to leave the nationalities to their own battles ; or *hey were Divisions on stages of Bills really decided in other stagesy or Divisions on the question of 4ojournment, or purely vexatiouis Divisions, where -some crazy Member is making fools of all the rest, and where, therefore, the fewer fools there are the better. WVe will venture to say of the 200, 50 are the very outside -that an ordinary Member would be wise to divide
-upon, or would find worth any consideration what. -ever. As we run through Mr. GissIoT's list, -wo see whole columns of most exco-llent names with :a much less number of Divisions opposite to. -them; while every now and then there comea - name which, unfortunately, combines a more than Average number of votes with a 1- ss than average reputation. It would be an invidious task to 4aelect them, but any ordinary reader would be -surprised to find what very unimportant personages haave been the most regular at Divisions, and with iow little wisdom England is g inerally governed. Let us look. Here is a good name, a great talker, no less than Mr. GLADSTONE, whose in-dustry and vigilance no one can douibt, and who probably voted whenever he thought it worth while to vote. Well; he voted )ully 58 times, :34d abstained 140 times. Another most excelaent. gentleman, much more remarkable for sleeping than voting, and apt to stay in th. House because it was more comfortable to stay than to move, -voted 95 times. But, if we wiere to mention the mame, n6fody would hesitate to adlit that Mr. {GLADSTONP was the more aigilant and painstaking anember of the two. Ministers, anC their subordiDates of course, vote very steadily. They must be there, so they may as well vote. Bvsiles, they vote for Members that Members may vote for them. But Aiere are the votes of three city Members,-DutE, -44; MAsTERBIAN 37; LordJoHNP RUSSELL, 29. With -the exception of Mr. B. OSBORNE anid Sir B. HALL, Iboth official voters, and Sir J. SHELLEY, a zealous namateur, the average of the metropolitan Members snorth of the Thames is not much more than the modest scale of duty which satisfies the conscience -of Lord JOHN RFSSELL.
As it happens, two of the metropolitan Members Uave addressed their constituents onl the subject, ,the one resting his claims on his place in the Divi-Sion List, the other excusing hiniteIf for his very low figure in that ledger of political merits. What-ever may be thought of their politics, however, few would place the man of few Divisions below the man of many in the scale of Parlia-mentary duty and efficiency. The man of many Divisions is Mr. Wi1xNsoN, who voted 161 times, and was therefore only absent from 3i divisions. But let such virtue speak for itself:-" In five " years he had given above 700 votes. It was pos-" sible that some of them might not be agreeable to " his constituents. On the other hand, he could
honestly and conscientiously explain every one " of those votes as having been given to the " best of his judgment and according to the dic" tates of his conscience." Why, most of them iiust have been on matters upon which he had .scarcely the least information; and he must -long ago have forgotten what most of the 3Iivisions were about. But that seems to have been his great idea of legislation. " He had
given more votes and been absent fewer times than MIr. WmILIAms ; so that whatever credit was claimed by that gentleman for assiduity and attention to Parliamentary duties belonged & rlso to him." Well; if HaEAVFx is to be at-tained by a book account of meritorious acts, -then May a patriot be made and a country be saved by 700 votes ; but not till then. On the other land, let us hear Sir W. CaL &Y; at all events, a man of weight, and one who has done his duty, whatever the Tower Hamlets may think to the contrary. He 'vote only' on 56 Divisions last Session, and here is --his own account of his stewardship:-" A weak "' attempt had been made to prejudice him in their
opinion by counting the Divisions at which he "' had not been present. He assured them that he
had diligently attended to his Parliamentary -' duties. There were few days in any Session -: of the late Parliament on which he had been
"absent from the House of Commons. It was "his practice every day to wait from the open-ing of the House until a late hour for "dinner, after which, if there vrere nothing in<'teresting to his constituents or the people, like
the majority of the better Members, he would " not return, but he had never been absent from
an important Division. As a means of esti"mating the merits of a Member of Parliament, "nothing could be more fallacious than merely to 5 count the Divisions. If it were a good test the " best member would be some junior Lord of -5 the Treasury, or some gentleman who hoped " to be a Junior Lord of the Trea49 sury, and who, having the fear of Mr. 5 HYvRin before his eyes, took precious good care ;' never to be absent from a Division. He had
' constantly been in the Library when Divisions
W ere caUed on some private Bill, and, although 5to be present would only have cost a walk of ten
yards, he had disdained so cheap a source of popularity. He could not think that 50 votes upon insignificant subjects were to be compared 5' with a single vote upon an important question." -Can anybody in his senses doubt this? There were, in fact, about forty Divisions, if so Imany, in which it was worth while to vote. All the rest were little more than legislative formalities, in which there are always people enough to perform; and a member may easily apply his tim e to much better advantage than taking part in them, for the mere purpose of running up a stock of virtue with the less intelligent class of his constituents.
As the Persian War has been already concluded

As the Persian War has been already concluded
by a satisfactory peace, the interest attaching to its events has, of course, somewhat diminished, and -some regret must be necessarily occasioned by the intelligence of bloodshed, trhich, as far as regards its influence upon the dispute, might possibly have been saved. The exploit, however, of our troops upon Persian territory recently announced is of so brilliant a character, and reflects at once such a lustre upon our arms and such a light upon the nature of the expedition in which -we have been engaged, that it is impossible to pass it over, even at a crisis like the present, without a tribute of applause to our army and its commander. From the intelligence now received it appears that the encounter telegraphed on Saturday as a cavalry -combat formed one of a series of 6perations undertaken against the enemy in the early part of last month. It will, perhaps, be recollected that the British forces, after the capture and occupation of Bushire, were encamped, with the exception of a garrison in the place itself, on the plain outside the town. One of the positions taken up by the Persians appears to have been at Boorazjoon or Brazjaun, a place situated on the road to Shiraz, but within 50 miles of Bushire. Here they were intzgiched, and from this position it -was anticipateddzat we might be attacked. On -the 3d of February, therefore, an expeditionary force marched from Bushire against the Persian position, which was reached on the 5th, and which was presently evacuated by the enemy, with the loss of all their ammunition and stores. This succems having been achieved, the troops prepared to return to their quarters on the 7th, during which movement the Persians seem to have ventured upon a night attack, but without efFect. On the 8th, being on their return march, they arrived at Khooshab, a place between Boorazjoon and Bushire,
and here occurred the engagement so brilliant and decisive.
At Ehooshab was posted a Persian divisiou about 6,000 strong, but whether composed of the troops dislodged from Boorazjoon or of some separate levies we are not distinctly informed. The British force employed upon the expedition comprised4,300infantry, 419 cavalry, and 1S guns, and with the cavalry and guns alone an attack upon the enemy as they stood was promptly made., The results were most remarkable. Not only was the Persiau4 army entirely routed, but the victory was attended with slight loss on our side, though the enemy left 700 on the field, besides 100 prisoners remaining in our hands. The details of the combat we are left to conjecture by the aid of the few particulars conveyed in the report. It is probable that the strength of the Persians consisted chiefly in cavalry, not only from their known preference for that arm, but from the circumstance of our own cavalry, to the exclusion of the infantry, having been employed against them; and, as they had only five guns, perhaps not very well served, it is clear that we had a decided superiority in artillery. Either by the aid of this advantage in driving them from their position, or in pursuance of some other manceuvres, it seems that the Persian horse must have been brought into such a collision with ours that the Bombay Cavalry found a fair field for the exercise of their prowess, and an irresistible charge, followed by severe execution on the routed host, will represent probably the history of the battle.
It is true that a result of this kind was always confidently predicted by those best acquainted with the cavalry of our Indian armies, but the signal success of sonie 400 troopers against a force which we must presume to have been at least four or five times their strength must satisfy, even it does not surpass, the anticipations of the most sanguine. It does not seem that our infantry was engaged at all. Under the skilful command of General Ou=RAn a few squadrons of Indian cavalry, with a battery or two of guns, have proved sufficient to drive in headlong rout a division of the enemy so considerable as to be styled " the Per" sian army," and to kill or take prisoners about twice their own number. This exploit will be thie more extraordinary if it should prove that the battle was mainly fought not with artillery, but with the sabre alone; for the Persian horse, as opposed to horse, should be no contemptible foe. Discipline they might undoubtedly lack, but most Eastern nations, and the Persians especially, furnish good borses, good horsemen, and dexterous swordsmen. Marked, indeed, is the contrast between the cavalry charge at Balaklava and that at Khoo8hab. The first was " magnificent" even in the eyes of the Russians, and exhibited as much dauntle3s and devoted heroism as any action on record; but the last was not only " nagnificent"-it was scientific " war" as well. There was skill as well as valour-gain as well as glory, and such a passage of arms may aid the world in conceiving what is likely to happen if any expedition, after struggling through Central Asia, should encounter upon the Indus an army of troops like these.
The parting address of the Bishop of NORWICH
The parting address of the Bishop of NoiVwiC
to his clergy on the resignation of his see, which we published yesterday, will be read with interest by his clergy, and deserves to be. It is written in the serious spitit of a person who is speaking for the last time to a body with which he has been connected by an important and sacred office, and who is now reviewing his own course, and looking back upon the past instead of anticipating the future. Its style, which is neither sentimental nor what is caled unctuous, is grave, solemn, sensible, and sincere, express& ing deep but guarded feeling, and, whatever may have been Dr. HINDS' defects in the episcopal office, the close is a truly episcopal one. But, with this full acknowledgment of the ability and sincerity of Dr. HINDS, even the melancholy occasion of his resignation of office, from rn-health, must not prevent us from making one or two criticisms upon his official career.
The character all Dr. HINDS' friends give of him is that pre-eminently of a sensible man. He is not a preacher, he is not a speaker, he has not been a writer, and he has not been a reader to speak of, but he has been talked of always as a dispassionate, well-judging man, cool, temperate, and considerate. If this character of him, then, is a true one,-and we have no reason to doubt it,it is a pity that we should have to record one exception to it, and that this exception should be his allowing himself eight years ago to be made Bishop of NORWICI. If general report may be depended on, Dr. HiNDs had perhaps as little peculiar fitness and aptitude for the episcopacy as any man of reflection, good sense, and good intentions ever had. Besides that he was already in failing health, nature had not made him social, conversational, or genial. He was not adapted for public life, for dealing with bodies of men, or making acquaintance with human nature on a large scale. Nature had marked out a quiet course for him, a private sphere of duty; such a life as many an intelligent clergyman of average station leads in this country who has his University recollections, his intellectual friendships, and his lenient parochial or other employment. A prebendal stall, or, what he actually had before he rose to the Bench, a Deanery, was the suitable promotion for Dr. HINDS. A theologian, though not a ponderous one, and with a taste for a certain line of half-philosophical, half-religious speculation, the disciple of Archbishop WHATELY could in such a situation have carried on his reflections pleasantly to himself and to the edification of the school to which he belonged. A book of the modest size which Dr. WHATELY has, to his great credit, adopted, or a pamphlet or a sermon on some subject of the day, would have reminded the world from time to time that a man of philosophical thought and religious feeling held the Deanery of Carlisle. This would have been quite proper and suitable, and no one would then have had a single exception to make to Dr. HINDS' character as a man of sense and judgment; but unfortunately sensible men are often apt to do exactly the things they advise others not to do. The case is always so very different when the man himself is the party concerned. If report says true, some who knew Dr. HINDS' capacity and class of talents best, and who were sufficiently intimate with him to be consulted by him on the occasion, endeavoured to dissuade him from accepting the Bishopric of Norwich. But the bauble of office has a charm even for the sensible man. We do not speak in any censorious spirit or as rebukers, but only as observers of what human nature as a matter of fact is. Thousands of sensible men have done exactly what Dr. HINDS did; it is nothing to Bay against a man that he made such a mistake; it would only have been a brilliant and sparkling piece of good sense if he had not. It would have been an enthusiastic sobriety, the very poetry of matter of fact. However, Dr. HINDS did not perform this i brilliant act of sense, and he was unlucL-y enough
to accept the Bishopric of Norwich, and to put himself in a false position, which brought an his deficiencies prominently into light. When it is said that a Bishop should be a lover of hospitality, it doubtless is not meant only that he should be liberal in his household economy. A genial disposition and particular turn of mind are involved im the pezept, a tumn of mind which does not
naturtfly belong to everybody-viz., & tste for soial intercourse,-that sort of drsp6eition'irhichz by making society agreeable to a man, enablesiiin in turn to be agreeable to society. This, asn *e say, is not everybody's taste, but it ought to be a Bishop's ex officio. A Bishop is by his office the head of a society of men. The faeo of man, as sueh, then, ought to be agreeable to him. He must not be select or exclusive, aid like smng parties and evenings with intimate friends. Half the influence of a Bishop is got by meeting his clergy on occasions not strictly professionaL The tone, the manner, and the thought which come out naturaly in the course of conversation, have an effect which many an elaborate sermon or charge has not, and personal presence and natural intercourse are the vehicles of a whole class of influences which do not come out at all in correspondence by the post or the pro. fessional interview. We must dissent, then, from that part of the Bishop's parting address where, in apparent apology for the little intercourse he has been able to maintain with his clergy, he refers to his letters and his interviewvs. These interviews, each on its appropriate and express matter of business, must necessarily be very .stiff affairs, and, however correct and judicious the decision of the Bishop may be on each question, it does not give him access to the hearts of his clergy. This must be byfree and natural intercourse-intercourse, indeed, of 'which formal business is often the occasion, but which is not itself fonnal. The Confirmation, the Consecration, and the Visitation are made use of by a Bishop who knows how to use his opportunities as occasions on which his clergy are brought together and into contact with him. The Bishop of Nonwicn, then, draws a false distinction when, he contrasts the Bishop's private acts and his public ones, as if in the absence of its Bishop on the latter occasions his diocess had only been deprived of his formal episcopal services, having enjoyed his real and solid ones in his letters and his interviews. The public acts are most useful as the occasions of private intercourse, and that much freeer and more telling than the professional interview or the business letter.
So happy a settlement of a great problem as the
So happy a settlement of a great problem as the recent admission of Turkey into the family of European nations was not likely to be lost on the other Mahomedan Powers. In these days, when the supremacy of the Christian and civilized nations is felt all over the earth, the potentates of the most remote States find that there is no safety for them but in drawing closer their relations with the leading Powers of the West, and averting any danger which may spring from the ambition of one by placing their dynasty and dominions under the guarantee of several. Turkey, with its selfgoverning dependencies of Egypt and Tunis, has taken this course; FxRuK KnA is engaged in negotiating treaties of amity with the most active nations of the globe, and even in the far East Princes like the Imauim of MuSCAT are anxious to have friends in the great Areopagus of the world. Among those Sovereigns who are, of their own choice, entering to some extent into the European system, we are glad to see the Sultan of Morocco. His dominions are situated at a most important point of the earth's surface; they command .the entrance to the Mediterranean, and are of scarcely less interest than the Peninsula itself in the eyes of the statesman. That such a country should be independent and prosperous is a matter of European importance. But the Sultan of MIonocco is the Sovereign of the Riff pirates or wreckers, and the fact that such a race should exist in the track of our Alexandria steamers, and on the cruising ground of our Mediterranean fleet, is enough to inspire serious apprehensions as to the vigour and stability of the ceitral Government. We must therefore feel gratified with the fact that this important, yet seemingly wealdy. governed country, has been brought into closer connexion with our own. After two years! negotiation a Treaty has been concluded between the Queen of GBuAT BRTAw and the Sultan of Monocco and FEZ, in which the relations of the two States are placed on a better footing, greater liberty given to the enterprise of the British people, and, of course, corresponding advantages assured to the Moors themselves. The Treaty signed on the 9th of December, 1856, has been just made public.
It is stipuIlated that the Qus: may appoint one or more Consuls in the dominions of the EMPmoin, and that both they and the Charg6 d'Affaires shall be inviolable both in person and house. Each shall have the liberty of establshing a place of worship, to be protected by the British flag. The next article gives the important right of freely travelling through the SULTAN'S territory. Any British subject shall have the right to pass through or reside in any part of His MYAJSv1S dominions, subject only to the same regulations as are submitted to by the citizens of the most favoured nations. Furthermore, British subjects shall have the right of freely hiring houses, and may claim to be assisted in so doing by the Moorish authorities. They shall not be obliged to pay, under any pretence whatever, any taxes or impositions. They shall be exempt from all militarv service, whether by land or sea, from forced loans, and from every extraordinary contribution. Their dwellings shall be respected; no arbitrary searches shall be made, no examination of books and papers, except with the orders and consent of the Consul-General or Consul. " And, generally, "His Majesty the SULTAN engages that the "subjects of Her Britannic' MJXsTy residing "in his states or dominions shall enjoy their pro"perty and personal security in as full and ample a "manner as subjects of the Emperor of MoRocco
are entitled to do within the territories of Her "Britannic MAJESTY." This guarantee of security to life and property is not unmeaning in the case of a Mahomedan State. When it is remembered that within the memory of the present generation European Ambassadors have been personally illtreated at Teheran, and that even now there exist cities which Englishmen cannot safely traverse without protection, it is no small thing to have the guarantee of this African potentate that Englishmen shall have full leave to reside in the most remote towns and to penetrate to the borders of the Desert without hindrance or molestation.
Two articles relate to the manner of carrying on trade, and then comes a stipulation which seems likely to be made whenever civilized men come in contact with Mussulman law. AU criminal causes and all civil differences occurring between British subjects shall be decided by the British Consul-General or his deputy, and no Governor, Cadi, or other Moorish authority shall intermeddle therein. In cases between a British and a Moorish subject the matter shall be referred to the authorities of the country to which the defendant belongs. If the defendant be a Moor, the matter goes before the Cadi, the British Consul being present; if the defc-ndant be an Englishman, the case is tried by the Consul, the Governor or Cadi being present. The Consul-General and the Moorish Minister of Foreign Affairs are judges in the last resort. This singular regulation is derived from the " capitulations" between the European Powers and Turkey, and, whatever may be the case at Constantinople, it is no doubt suited to the circumstances of suclh an empire as Morocco.
The rest of the Treaty is mainly compoeed of articles relating to the conduct of businew, which, though no dmsht impwnt, are of lIttIQ general
interest. Mi final clauso guatantees security I to al1 the BAtish rOdenje in the country in the eveit of a war between tho two Powers. In ,such oase, British subjec shall have liberty to depart, .and six months shall be granted them for windn9g up their affairs. To the Treaty is appended - a Convention of Commerce and Navigation, which
stipulates in detail for many pracical advantages. This Treaty, following close upon the settlement of the Eastern question and the assertion of our proper position in Persia, is an event, we think, of no little importance. Although Morocco has beeh hitherto a country little known to the traveller or the capitalist,' yet, from its position, its proximity to our own shores, and the inereasing interest taken in the regions inhabited by races of. Mussulman faith, it will probably receive its share of attention. Perhaps some of the energy with which Englishmen are opening and developing Turkey, Egypt, and India may not be wasted on the domi3nions of our nearest Mussulnan neighbour.

The Riot At Kidderminster.
I , THE RIOT A T KDDERVINSTjER.
KDDBRMINSTZ& MomAny Evrmmm
We are glhd to stat. thet, although the injuries austained by Mr. Love in the brutal and diraceful attack made upon him on Saturday are srioux ioe is progree&ig satisfactorily to .Wards xecovery.
To-day four of the rioters, captured by the police after tbeRiot Act was read on Saturdaynight, were brought before the mayor and magistrates at the Town.haU. Their names a John Hayes, Jobn Cook, James Frank, and James Siater. The two former werearged with assault ing the police in the discharge of their duty, and the two latter with refUsing to disperse ater the liot Act bad bee3 read. Mr. Best appeared for. the prosecution, and .r Crowther for the defenc. The magistrates met at 11 o'clock, and were in cornslktion for an bour and a half as to the beat mode ef prooed&e. Evidence was then taken as to the four accused, ad it was stated that one of the po7icemen injured had had biezose brokeb, and received other injuries which it war feared would end in lockjaw or erysipelas, and probably dentr. it appoaring that Frank and Slater had not ofered any Tioleat resistance to the officers, they wereorderecto be iseharged, th two others being remanded to Friday, by whiech day it is fuly expected that some of the ringleadersWI be in anstody. The police also expect to be enablehy thattime to ascertain who wore the few respectabl trdesmen of ti e town by whom the rioters are said to haebeneurgedo3 to the outrage.
The authoritiee have apprehensions of renewed disturbncees, and the Eussars, telegraphed for on Saturday, and who arrived in the course of the night, are to remain kere. A portion of the force left this evening, but ethers are to replace them to-morrow.
The town remains in a state of considerable ferment, and the principal streets are atill occupied with loiterers. Rumours giving very different and varied complehions of the events of Saturday are afloat, which it would not be desirableto repeat here; but it is quite certain that Wa not Mr. we and his frionds made good their retreat into tbe bouse in Bewdleyzstreet, they would, in all probability, have been murdered by the infuriated mob.
To The Editor Of The Times.
TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TINES.
oir,-.s consioeraolo dwerence or opinion exists, and manyvarying statements are made concerning the sCene which followed the close of the poll in this place on Saturday last, I deem it my duty to accede to a request that I would make public my own impressions as an eye. witness in a particularly favourable position for observing what occurred.
I occupied an elevated place upon a garden-wanl, about 250 yards from tho polling-booth, and abutting upon the public road along which the processions were compelled to pass in returning to Kidderminster.
By means of a telescope I was enabled acnrately to discern what passed at the booth and all al>ug the route.
Some short time before the close ofthc, poll it was possible to perceive that stones were being hurled into the booth, despite the apparent remonstrance of the Mayor and MIr. W. B. Best, who were seen to address the persons present.
About 25 minutes past 4 Mr. Boycott quitted the pollingbooth and passed on into tho town, accompanied by a small number of his friends. He was warmly applauded by the persons who lined the route, and bowed politely in recognition, without the appearance of any further communication.
Several gentlemen belonging tohis partyfollowed, but did not appear to pass beyond the point at which I was standing.
In about ton minutes Mr. Lowe and his supporters were seen to leave the booth, preceded by the Mayor and Mr. W. B. test. Their appearance was the signal for loud cries, and some few mnisiles began to fly. They advanced, however, for about 50 yards without serious molestation. They then reached a portion of the road commanded du the one side by the wall of St. John's Church, and on the other by an embankment lined by a large number of persons. Those persons, at the instant when Mr. Lowe's party came opposite to them, without stooping down or appearing to pick up anything, delivered several voUeys of stones and brlckbats with almost military precision. At this moment the mob closed in, and many men, leaping up in the air, hurled stones at the small party with Mr. Lowe, over the heads of the persona intervening.
At the same time others rmming parallel to the above. mentioned gentlemen eudavoured to cast mismiles in a lateral direction and from underneath, so as to reach the faces of the party as they bent down their heads to avoid the stones from the bank upon their right and from behind.
The police in uniform appeared to exert themselves to tho utmost to keep off the men who, with bludgeons and stones, pressed hard upon the party with M1r. Lowe. The special constables either dispersoadamongthe crowdasthe firt volley o; stones, or continued to walk psively behind the cortege without attempting to arrest any one,-at least so far as I could see.
By the time the party reached the wall where I stood several gentlemen were prostrated, and several bleeding profusely. Those who remained upright were evidently suffering severely. Having seen something of popular oom. motions, both in this co untry and on the Continent, I felt no doubt in my own mind, from the bearing of the mob and the nature of the weapons employed, that the lives of the persons beneath me -were in imminent periL I therefore hastened with all possible speed to render what aid I could.
I was fortunately successful in directing the attention of the party assailed to a gate in my own grounds, and having removed the interior fastenings, with the assistanoe of another person, I dragged in Mr. Lowe, literaUy streaming with blood, and he was immediately followed by several gentlemen wounded like himself. We had a hard struggle at the gate, during the course of which I was once down and several times struck with missiles. Finally we closed the gates. An attempt was made to scale them, which was defeated by the prompt resistance of one of the persons present.
Menaces and imprecations were for some time directed by name against the gentlemen who had taken refuge, and there was considerable battering at the gate and demands upon myself to produce Messrs. Lowe and Pardoe.
The injuries inflicted upon the persons received within the house can be ascertained from a more authentic source than my report. I have preserved a specimen of the missiles employed, many of which fell within my garden.
I cannot at all pretend to identify individuals. It is my very strong conviction that the great majority of the men immediately assailing Mr. Lowe and his frionds were not from Kidderminster. They presented an appearance quite distinct from that of carpet weavers-a class of persons by no means difficult to distinguish when the eye has been familiar with them. The friends of Mr. Boycott who had not accompanied him into the town appeared to take refuge among the persons upon the bank as soon as Mr. Lowe reached that part of the road.
Very many of those persons were women-a large portion respectably dressed. I observed that numbers of them prcduced stones from beneath their shawls, and were very prominent in the attack.
I hope it is not necessary to protest that I have no purpose, political or other, to subserve in making this statement. I had taken no part in the election; but I hold that every citizen of a free cuntry is bound by his duty not to shiink from stating publicly what he has personally seen, when there is a question as to the violation of ita laws.
I have "extenuated nothing;" I equally trust I have "set down nothing in malcc i" for, except in the unavoidable melc at the gate, I am bound to say that both my house and property were respected bythe populace.
JOHN G. SaEPPARD.
Woodfield-honse, March 30.
TO THE EXDITOB OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Aflow me to make a few remarks upon the cowardly outrage committed on Mr. Lowe yesterday by the scum and rascaldom of this town. Ever sinco the passing of the Reform Bill, when Mr. Godson was elected, not for any political principles he possessd, but because, as a barrister, he had saved a number of weavers from well-merited punishment as rioters, the non-electors have claimed the right of dictation to the electors who should be member, and Liberals have Toted at the risk of seriouS personal injury. Knowing this, and that Mr. Boycott, by a little judicious almsgiving and popularity hunting, had raised tho mob fever higher than usual, preparations should have been mado accordingly. There was alarge vacant space of ground called Cald*ell-meadow, central, easy of access, and with many approaches to it. The hustings were, however, erected on Blakebrook-green, nearly a mile from the station. house, and the Liberal voters to reach it had to pass through a long and narrow street, in the middle of which was hlr. Boycott's head-quarters, the Black Hcse. The road con. tinues narrow, winding through the Park Butts till it comes to Cussflield, 'where it hias been lowered from 20 to 30 feet. A shower of missiles descended from theea banks upon any enpopular passer by, and :n tempting proximity to the booth were a ereat number of stones broken for roadrmaking. The special constables were very few in quantity and notoriously bad in quality. The police of the town au8 enly 12 in number, and they, with about 100 'worthless specials, slected from the very class on which Mr. Boycott exercises most influence, were all the resources to meet he riffraff of the town, set 1oose by the Saturday half-holyday and maddened by tle shameful defeat of their favourite. Some stones wese thrown at Mr. lowe on his leaving the hustinga at h -past 1 o'clock, aad he was urged not toreturn, but, itdgisg too favowably of the Kidderininster people, he re| txn to to t Iij. There are strong reasons for supposing

They did not d& so, 16owever; indeed, the firs intimation of sione-tbrowing tame from Mr. A. Talboto Mr. Boycott's proposer, who culled out, "iLad, don't throw any stors."

The women had AtOne.M in their &prons, the mien had their pockets-filted ;every atone found a target in the body of some of our number.- The, stones rattled off the hats and ehouldera-of Mr. Lowe, and Mr. Psrdoe like haistones on a roof; in thia.way we mnthe. gauntlet for 250 yards, losing one of our nunuber at-every stride. Those who fell were savagely kicsed-by the brute. around, and several policemen were disabled in rescuing them from their brutal assailants. We eadsw for a,gentleman'shousewhich lies back from the road.bat thegreatt; gate was locked or fastened so that it could not be opened,. Mr. Lowe and his two friends were nearest thagate. Mr, Best and Inspector Forty having left us the mob oame upj. and, though Mr. Lo we was bleeding, his white hair dabble& In blood had no effect on them-thoy kept pelting hilm with cowardly ferocity and the most horrid imprecations. With great difficulty we got him through a little. door abouti a dozen yards further on which led to the back door of the' Rev. Mr. Sheppard's house. Out of nine of us who, got int there seven were bleeding badly, and those of our £rieuds- who, were in the road were maltreated, followed into tbhhouse"& where they took refuge, and kicked, and the windows, smashed where they were thought to be.
I will iiot dwell upon these scenes, or upon the towmx being at the mercy of the populace all the nizht, as I dil not witness them myself ; but I will state that the attack was as unprovoked as it was cowardly, that the Lowe party made no gestures of menace or triumpb, and did not attempt; to insult or coerce any one ; that Mr. Lowe has never in one, instance descended to personalities, and his party havo not so much as published a single squib or plaard reflecting upon Mr. Boycott or any of liis party. On the contrary, Mr. Boycott, by telling the non-electors from the first tbati the contest was theirs, that they could win his eleotion it they liked, and that without their support he mnst retire, but with it was sure of victory, had led them to beheve that they were the real electors, and that if they woul&i bully and beat their opponents Boycott would conquer; at the same time, Mr. Boycott knew he had never mbre thars 160 promises out of 500 electors, and that he had no chance of success from the first. I remain ours. c..

Sir,-The election intelligence contained in your columns is usually so accLrate that I read with great surprise im yonr impression of yesterday what professed to be an account of the political prinaciples which I havo enunciate here.
The wide circulation of so erroneous a statement may Inflict no slight injury on one who, like myself, ia as yet but entering upon political life, and such injury I am sure yoz would never desire to inflict.
In the paragraph to which I alludo I am said to be oontesting this borough " upon principles which, if not identical with those of Mr. Ernest Jones, may at least be denominated Chartist." I beg to state that such an assertion is altogether unfounded.
In common with many other Liberals I advocate the baUot; liko most Liborals, I desire to sos the suffrage extended, but I am altogether opposed to tho concession of universal suffrage, triennial Parliaments, electoral districts, and the other distinctive articles of the Chartist6 creed.
I am a Liberal, but the principles I hold are those of temperate and Conservative Liberalism, as they ae maintained by Lord John Russell and expressed by him ia bis address to the electors of the city of London.
I hope you will not refuse to give insertion to theso few lines, and am, Sir, your obedient servant,

It is true that I was very desirous to go to the poll, for, having received during one week's cauvass promises of ruprort m bove 500 electors out of a number of 1,160,1 still hoped for success, but it is not true that I ever pledged myself, directly or indirectly, to do so, or else I would have kept my word.

PARIB, M1tcH 29, 6 P.sx
While Father Ventura is causing the Chapel of the Tuileries to resound with denunciations of zplendid immorality, and earning an oulogium as honourable as that which the Regent Morton promotmced on John Knox, who had often censured himself with great severity, " that he was one who never feared the faco of man," Father Felix is ttying to win the population of the poorer quarters of the city from less-profitable sins. The one is earnest in his exhortations against irregalarities for which there may be some palliation ; and the intrepid Dominican thunders against vices for which there is no excuse, and " lays bare the hearts that lurk beneath a star." Thus attacked at both extremities of the social scale, let us hope that the high and powerful will cease to scandalize the world, at the same time that thehumble inners mend their ways.
In the meantime it is said that the police have discovered the existence of a new secret society, known, Ibelieve, as the Bons fiommes, Bom Enfcns, or some such name. A good many arrests were made on Friday morning, half of the captured belonging probably to the police itself. For some timepast little Lasr been said about these mysterious combinations, which not long ago threatened to sap the foundations of society itself; it was thought they had disappeared altogether. Such, however, is not the case, if wre are to believe what is currently reported. The Emperor haa done a great deal to root out evil from the country, and he has shown that in case of emergency he will spare no efforts to complete the ralutary work. TranquilDity has no doubt been restored, but persons affirm that itis ohly at the surface, and that the disease makes not the less progress that it escapes the public eye. We are told that the secret societies extend their action throughout 60 or T0 departments, where there exist ramifications more or less profound, and that experience has enabled them to afford less chance of detection by the police and of betrayal by accomplices or the indiscretion of weak brothers.
It would appear that the Haute Vente (to use the style of Carbonarism) is directed by some of the most infiluential among the political refugees in Em,land. Between them and the directors at home there often arises much dissension. The latter willingly accept the co-operation of the absent, but they absolately reject all dictation from them. At home the organization is almost confined to the lower classes, and these are jealous and impatient of the sort of guerainet claimed by their superiors in social rank and education. " We know what we have to expect from the dress coats," thcy contemptuously observe, "and from men of pretended capacity; we have seen them at work, and we will not again admit them except as auxiliaries."
Various modifications have been introduced into the present organization of the affiliated. These are no longer classed in decuies or centuries. No single member can communicate withmore thanthree other members, and, in imitation of the secret societies under the Restoration, these occupy respectively the extremity of an imaginary triangle, with its sides touching another triangle, and so on, spreading out over the departments.
The politico-commercial language previously employed in the transmission of orders from one place to another, whether by the post or by the electric telegraph, has been completely changed. The words " merchandise," commercial traveller," "shares," which signified "arms," "emissaries," "subscriptions," &c., have been long discovered by the police, and have consequently given place to other terms. The communications are now tent as much as possible by such of the affiliated as belong to the society called Bureau du Tour de France. It is known that a considerable number of working men make each year a tour in the departments, with the object of improving themselves in their respective traded. Such of them as are adepts and in whom great confidence is placed are employed as channels for communicating the orders of the committees. When these orders are pressing the emissaries travel by railroad, their expenses of course being paid. By this means the chances of discovery by the Postoffice are greatly diminished. The new secret society said to be just discovered, and which occasioned the arrests alluded to, is perhaps a branch of the great association under its recent organization.
The Legislative Corps is beginning to display unusual activity. It has been intimated that, unless some extraordinary and unforeseen event occur, the session will not be prolonged beyond the 16th May, its legal term, and the elections for the new Chamber wiU probably be fixed for the 7th June. The Government is anxious that the elections shall take place with as little delay as possible, so as to give no time for the organization of an opposition. As matters stand some uncertainty prevails respecting the result of the elections at Lille, Ronen, Lyons, Marseilles, Montpelier, and Paris. The Democratic party invited M. Cremieux and M. Jules Favre to present themselves as candidates for Lyons, but these gentlemen have refused, probahly from unwillingness to take the oath of allegiance to the Government. Had they accepted, their return was not improbable. In some other departments the Goverament will not oppose certain members of the present Chamber, though they are not of its own choice, lest the Ministerial candidates should be beaten if there were a contest.
Al. de Montalembert is, I believe, pretty sure of his election in the Doubs, supported as he wiU be by the Catholic party, his colleague going on the
Liberal interest-literal, that is, in religious matters.] Ii. Havin, director of the SiMcie newspaper, is spoken I of for Paris, but if he come forward, which is dou btful, it would be in his own department, the Calvados, and not as a Governmentcandidate. Generally speaking, however, such of the present Deputies as are put forward by the Government will be returned. It was originally intended to bring forward M. Berryer, son of the great orator, as a candidate for DlarseiUes, but the unfortunate disclosures in the Napoleon Docks affair have put an end to that. At all events, the Government will allow as short an interval as possible to elapse between the close of the present session and the elections for the new Chamber.
A letter from Jassy, in Moldavia, of the 12th inst., informs us that on that day was accomplished the solenufity of the promulgation of the Imperial firman of the Sultan, relative to the convocation of tile Divans ad hoc. For that purpose the superior clergy, the Ministers, the high civil and military functionaries, the representatives of foreign Powers, the Austrian Generals, and the Boyards assembled at the Palace, in the Throne-room, which was ornamented with the portrait of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan Abdul-Medjid. At 12 his Excellency Kabouli Effendi, bearer of the Imperial firman, accompanied by a guard of honour, arrived at the Palace in a state carriage, and, having taken his seat on the bench occupied by his Excellency the Prince Raimakan and the Ministers, with the Diplomatic corps, and having done homage to the Imperial do. cument, he read the Turkish text, and afterwards Alexander Stourdza, Secretary of State, read the translation in the Rouman language. The reading terminated, his ExcellencyKabouli Effendi addressed the Kaimakan in the French language as followes:-
" His Imperial Majesty the Sultan, with his constant solicitude for the prosperity of Moldavia, has fixed by an Imperial firmau the formation of the Divan ad hoc which is sutmmoned to express the wishes of the population on tibe revision and amelioration of the interior regulations of this principality. Charged by the Sublime Porte to hand to your Excellency this Imperial firman of oar august master, I
pre smoe to hope that the faithful Moldavians will, as ever, find in it the paternal sentiments of the Government of His
Imperial Majesty, and that, penetrated with the importance
of the act which they are about to accomplish, they v.ll proced to the elections of which this firman regulates the
form with the tranquillity and moderation which the Sublime Porte has a right to expect from them."
EHis Excellency the Prince Kaimakan next expressed his gratitude and that of the country in these terms .-
"I pray your Exeellency to be pleased to lay at the feet of Eis ImpeTial Majesty t ,he Sultan the hom age and the profound gratitude of the country for his constant and paternal solicitude in favour of the destinies of Moldavia. The n ew favour by which His Imperial Majesty at present wishes to manifest his magnanimous sentiments is the more valuable as we see in it the pledge of the preservation of our
privileges and immunities granted ab anatquo to this principality. My country will maintain itself in the position indicated bythe Importantact it is called onto accomplish bypro-
e~eeding to the prescribed eletions with perfect tranquillity anh mod . We all address fervent prayers to Heaven
01it it 4 J tVfo preserve the preious life of His Im-
W,*laj,.ty ~he Sultan, af to render his empire more
powerful and more glorious thau ever. We are bappy cb the choice which the Sublihe Porte has made in the person of your Excellency to tringut this Ikperial firnria,twhich opens to Moldavia a new er of prosperity.

This act was greeted with'the enthusiastic Ueclamations of all present. While -the fixran was being read the troops of the garrison were under arms, and the artiUery fired 101 guns.
The last detachments of the Imperial Austrian troops had moved forward to evacuate the Principality, M. Faur had been delegated by the local Government to aecompany the troops to the frontier.
The Imperial Court will remove to Fontainebleau onthe lst of May in order to reeeive the Archduke Constantine. The reason assigned for this temporary removal is, that the Emperor wishes to keep the Archduke from showing his eccentricities in public, and probably from getting into wcrapes-for he is r^id to be eccentric. His Highness may run about the woods of Fontainebleau as much as he pleases, but it is considered prudetif *o keep him out of the reach of the Clarivari. This is the reason assigned by people who profess to know a good deal about the Court.
An agent of the Neapolitan Minister for Foreign fairs is said to have arrived this morning in Paris. He came last from Rome by Civita Vecohia. He has no official mission, but his journey is said not to be unconnected with politics.

VIENNA, Mmcx 2B.
Count Paar andhis secretary quitted the Sardinian capital yesterday, Thursday, the 26th, and the Marquis do Cantono intends to leave Vienna for Turin in a day or two. The Austrian Government affects to attach no importance to the diplomatic rupture with Sardinia, and the Ost-Dutsche Post and the Oesterrehische Zeitung are at great pains to show that no evil consequences can possibly arise from it, but still the measure is not to the taste of the public.
It is generally known that Count Staslkelberg, the Russian Minister, exercises undue influence on Count Cavour and his colleagues, a-id people ark whether this Government has acted wisely in leaving him entirely master of t'ne field. Doubtless it would have been better if Austria had not interrupted her diplomatic relations with Sardinia, but the insults offered to the Emperor by some of the organs of the Turin press greatly exasperated his military attendantb, and, as theoview wbich they took of the mattcr found favour with His Majesty, Count Baol received orders to demand satisfaction of the Sardinian Government. Men in office state that the Ministers propooed to send the note of the 10th of February to Turin, but it is whispered that the military party in the LombardoVenetian kingdom took the initiative. If the Imperial Geneia's are consistent they will now insist on the recall of Count Valentvne Esterhazy from St. Petersburg, as the Rus"ian Government has given quite as much offence to Austria as the Turin Cabinet. " During the last three years," said a Rusqian diplomatist to a person of my acquaintAnce, " we have not ceased to administer moral punishment to Austria, and the time when we shall be able to balancs accounts with her must sooner or later come."
The Joz'maZ de iFranefort contains an article on the relations between Rome and the other European Powers, which requires notice, a- it comes from a semi-official Austrian source. The Vienna publcist says:-
"- At the Paris Congress hL de C_vour spoke at length on the state of things in the domains, of the Church. The French Minister also touched on the subject, but it was only from politeness towards a guest who, as au exceptional case and once for all, was admitted to a table prepared for the most high and mighty of the earth. Evei1 one felt that the Sardinian Cabinet had gone beyond its tether when it meddled in a matter i-i which only two Powers-France and Austria-were entitled to interfere. It was not to be supposed that the two great Catholic Powers-that ' the Apostolic Emperor and King' and the 'Eldest Son of the Chrrch' -would permit schismatic Russia, Protestant England and Prassia, Sardinia, which is inreligioas insrurection agaiust Rome, and emancipated, but still Mahomedan Turkey, to act as judges of the acts and deeds o2 the Pope. As long as Austria and France maintain loyol and frienely relationsand we have the conviction that they never will be disturbed-they alone wi" have to come to an undershuenug in respect ta the coursels wh:ch it may appmsar necessamy to give to ais Holmc-iu."
If the Pope were only the Sovereign Pontiff or head of the Roman Church the Catholic Powers would alone be entitled to give him counsel, but as he is a temporal as well as a spiritual ruler schismatic Russia, Protestant England and Prussia, &c., are bound to give him their friendly advice, if only to prevent the necessity for the occupation of his territories by foreign Powers, a me;> sure which so seriously distarbs the balance of power in Europe.
As M. de Bontenieff has made a formal complaint because the Kangaroo was allowed to go to the Circassian coast, it may be as weP to state that all the Constantinople correspondents of the German papers state that the Russian Ambassador was aware of what was going on "some weeks before the Kanga- oo started." The Constantinople mail of the 20th inst. has brought but iittle news. The affair of the Kangaroo is being inquired into.

I last night forwarded you by telegraph the first inkling we have received, vid Konigsburg, that the long expected, much looked for reduction in the Russian tariff has at length taken place, and I trust soon to have official verification of the facts as well as further particulars. At present the only information that has reached me is to the effect that in the newv tariff the duty on many articles is very materially reduced. This is more particularly the case with raw cotton and manufactured woollen goods, the duty on which is reduced by nearly one half; on ribands and silk the duty is reduced from 4r. to 2r.; cloths *of all kinds are put at ir. 40c.; manufactured silk goods remain unchanged; readymade linen is reduced from 60 to 35 per cent. ad valorem. On the other hand, linen cloth, not made up, is to be taxed 25 per cent. heavier than before. It is more than probable that some of the above particulars are not strictly correct; the more than laconic brevity in which the communication that has reached me iz couched makes any misunderstanding perfectly pos3ible and pardonable.
The organ of the Senate publishes an Imperial ukase, addressed, underdate of the 20th ult., to the Finance Minister, authorizing him to issue the six remaining series of Treasury notes, each amounting to 3,000,000 silver roubles-18,000,000 altogether. Two of these series, Nos. 49 and 50, amounting to 6,000,000, are to be paid into the Treasury for tle purpose of "strengthening thebalance ;" theseries49 to bear interest from Miarch 1 (13), and the series 50, from May 1 (13) of this year. The other four series are to take the place of the Treasury notes issued inl849, and bear interest from October 1 (13), 185t7.
The Hydrographic Department has also issued notifications-first, with reference to the signal masts erected at Cronstadt, various ports of the Baltic and Black Seas, and of the eastern ocean, for the purpose of naval telegraphs, according to the sy"tem of Renaud Chauvency; and, secondly, the measures to be taken at the return of spring for indicating the spots dangerous to navigation in the neighbourhood of Forts Paul and Constantine (in the Cronstadt Roads).
There is a lively demand for tallow just now in St. Peterburg for delivery in the summer; the prices offered, however, are very considerably and disproportionately lower than those quoted in London, which is said to arise from the difficulty of obtaining tonnage accommodation.
Investigations have been instituted in several departments of the service in consequence of the statements made by Sir R. Peel in his speech neur Birmingham. The result has been, it is said, to prove the entire innocence of the persons incriminated bv Sir Robert.
The friends of peace in RuEsia express great satisfaction at the conc'usion of the treaty between England and Persia. At the moment when the Emperor received the intelligence Prince Gortschakoff happened to be with him, and received the news from the Emperor's mouth. The latter exclaimed in conclusion, "A la banse heure;
.94n sui&_res co2den4 Dikes4eJ4M. Wodhtse." The Prince repaired immediately to op-Min.isters and} after congratulatint him,, insvited Ihim.to- a rand entertainment-to'e'kitifii- honourr the occadion. -The enteitainfiiin acrdingltoIplace in the Hotel of Foreign Affair a b i'verxplhelidia scale, and was attended 'by nearly every imboAsy, with their entire pers3nnde. The-Inmeal,W orX erar Bee, and the YouriaZ of thie Aca,demy #xpress their satisfaction also at the peace, t_ough thexformer seems dissatisfied that Englnad shouLd obtain any advantages by it.
The visit of the 'VLdia of Montenegro to Paris excites the attention of the St. Petersburg'press extremely, and ai3iords a welcoraeopportunityof ventin r every imaginable exprewsson of spite against Austria, and which England does n6t altogether esCaPe. The Norten Bee is more particdlarly angry that Paris eshould have become the ceitre of gravitation, to which all who Eeek relief from any griefs resort, and that even questions that nearly concern Russia should be referred for settlemenlt to the banka of the Seine. The cause of this is suppoiad to be that the Emperor in all his official relations is most courteous and attentive to M~. de Morny',-an example which is described as not being followed to iniplicitly by the higher ranks. It is now decided that the French Minister will remain the entire summer in St. Petersburg; his first Secretary of Legation, however, M. Baudin, is about to leave St. Petersburg for af ew months.
Counit Putiatin, who lately left St. Petersburg for Moscow, has again left tne latter capital, and set out for the Chinese frontier. It is believed that this mission takes place in connoxion with the complications in which that empire is just now involved with England, mid in which the Ruesian press seewns' to think that France and the United States of America are about to take a part. The view taken up, as to the manner in which Russia would step forward in this matter, goes to the extent of supposing that theEmperor world make common cause with the above-mentioned Powers intho task of eonquering the obstinate exclusiveness of the Celestial Empire, or at any rate in deriving from the embarrassments of the Chinese every possible advantag,e-
territorial, commercial, and diplomati6. I
The Caucaeus contains a very circumstantial account of another expedition which was made towards' the end of January in' the Great Tschetclrna, Schamyl's territory, and which lasted a fortnight. Several aul.s were burnt, and paths were cut through two tbick forests with a view to future ent3rpriszs. The Tscherkessen are described as bavAng opposed a most vigorouls resistance, and as having made ample uBe of their mountain artilery; but nothing was able to stop the advance of the Russians, who, after attaining their object, retired to their former position with a loss of 39 men killed. The expedition was conducted by General Je svdomilroff.

Last Monday the MiJi'iter Ptc-ident, Be-3n von Mantenfiel, ladd before both HIoures o2 tle Diet the treatylately concluded writh Denmark for the redemption of the Sound Dues, and it was eventuall-y agreed that a pecial committ:e shound he named at once for the exam'nat on o. the gerer0l teeaty for the redemption and the draught o2 the special treaty as to the Inodus of the payment. The greatest expzdition wiU be observed by the co-nmittee in branging up its re;ort on the subject, so that, if p usible, the Goverr-nent nray be enabk I to ratify the treatics and forward them to Copenhagen by theist of Apiil. To tho3e Statcs that ere unable to fulfil this c3remonial by the appointk i time the D.tiQh Goveuinment has undertaken not to detnin their vesse!3 on their paQsage through the Sound after April 1, but simply to require evidence of the;- nationality, in order that accou17t may'be keptof the amount of dues thus accruing; whether this amount will subisequently be claimcd fromthose States thst are bebindhand with their ratification i- not clear to me, but, at any rate, the Danish Government gets a security from each of Lhe parties for the eventual paynent of the dues acer tiuW after the 1st of April, in case thesaidtreatyshouldnot beratificl at all. With regard to the land transit ducs across the Cimbric Peninsula, they are to come into force piovisionally on aud after the 1st of April, without any special arrangement with reference to the possibility of non-ratitication.
The Zollverein Conference, which was opened here yesterday week for the consideration of certfin proposals made by Austria wth a N;ew to fac"irtat3 commercial intercourse between Austria and the Zollverein, and pave the way for a fusion of the two territorial and fiscal unions into one body in the year 1866, has had daily sittings since then, aud has almost, if not quite, finished this the first section of its labours. Now that the Austrian propositions to the ZoUvereiu have been settled, the members of the conference will proceed to deliberate on what proposals shaU be made by the Zo?lverein to Austria; this second poxtion of their laboara will probably occupy about a fortnight; when the -whole is concluded aud ratified by the d;fferent Governments concerned it is probable that the representatives of the three ZoUverein Stat:.-% contermiuous with Austria-viz., Prussia, Bavaria, and Saxony, wiU confer on the subject in Vienna with a. representative of Austria. The proposals that Austria has made, professedly for the pv-pose of facilitating commercial intercourse between her and the Zollverein, are, in fact, proposals for ass - milating the Zo?lverem tariff and classification of goods to those observed in Austria. Iu some small particulars it is very probable that these latter, as being the most recently settled, may be an improvement on the former, but it wiU require that they should be manifestly the greatest improvements before the Zollverein cau adopt them, inasmuch as in whatever proportion the latter assimilates itself to Austria it prejudges the question of an entire fusion that wiU come on for discussion in 1860, and for eventual adoption in 1866. The present struggle between the Zollverein and Austria for the general adoption of their respective tariffs and systems is merely a struggle between high protection aud liberal prohibition-pretty much t.e difference between six and half a dozen. A proposal that has been made by Austria over and above those contemplated in the existing treaty of commerce between Austria and the Zollverein-viz., fcr an immediate fusion of the two fiscal systems-has been rejected at once; it is contrary to the interest of the North German States, particularly those oa the seaboard, and it is opposed to both the political and commercial interests of Prussia to admit Austria into the Zollverein; their position is bad enough vis-d-ais those Southern members of the Customs Union who obstruct every species of liberal reform of the tariff, and it would be infinitely worse if Austria were to enter ard throw an overweening preponderance on the side of the Southern States and prohibition. The true policy of Prussia in commercial matters is to tabe the earliest opportunity of constructing a Nori
Germana Customs Union on the Niberal pr>aciples which Hanover and the States of the Steuerverein affect, and, as Austria is determined, by hook or by crook, to get up a Customs Union also, t^. let her take all the protectionist and prohibitive States in the south and form one with them. Good and excellent as the original idea of the Zoll-
verem was, and many of its results have shown themselves to be, there is so large a balance of evil arising to Prussia from its present composition and tariff that it is difficult to point out any reform ,o advantageous to the prosperity of the country as its release from its presentobligations to the Zollvereuw.
Herr von Rochow, by whose hand the late Pres - dent of Police, Herr von Hinckeldey, was shot in a duel here in March of last year, has just r - ceived from the King a remission of the remaindtr
of hirs sentence, which condemned him to five year.' imprisonment m the fortress of Magdeburg. Th a act of mercy has been extended to him at the intercession, strange to say, of the widow of the mi-n he Xhot. On the anniversary of his deatb, about a forbnight baak, she aldressed a letter to the King, in which she put forth that her feelin. a of bereavement, which the recollections of that day tended only to enhance, led her irresistibly to sywpathize with the ompulsory privat;ion of her hu - band's presence and sOCiety the Frau von Rochow WaS still undergoing, and she begged that His Majesty would, in kindness to the memomy of the deceased, grant her the favour of enabling her to restore to the Frau von Rochow her imprisoned husband by granting Mim a full pardon. The King aceedcd to this gererous petition in a most fceling letter addres-ed to her, extending to the length of tbree pages, written throughout and addressed by himself, in which he exnreezed the extreme gratification he felt in fulfiding this noble request -one bearing so markedly the impress of tbe noble character of thedeceased, and so highlyhonour-

The amount which the populasios$9f Berlin haspresqnted to the widow as a testiinonal of respect to the deceased is 21,000 thalers, while the provision which the King hamade for her and her children has fallen very far xhort of what his own expi-esaiona and profesions hadled everybody to expect.
lNegotiations are being ca'rried on now in Paris at the instigation of Austria with reference to the conclusion of a Postal Treaty between France andc tho Austro-German postal union ; the treat hitherto existing between France and Prussia wil expire shortly, and for the purpoae of co-operating in these negotiations a high offioer of this Post-office has .been despatched thither. The chief . objocts in the conclusion of the new treaty will be the reductionof the transit postage through France to Spain and-the adoption of a similar rate of postage and amount of weight for the single letter in both France and Germany.
The Prince of Prussia has just had a narrow escape; he was driving with post horses into Remagen early on the 24th inst. for the purpose of being present at the consecration of the Apollinari§ Church, when the leaders suddenly turned short round the building in which the Post-office used to be, and, after dMahing the carriage agaiast the corner of thehouse, galloped-wildly down a steep street leading to the Rhine, dragging the shattered carriage after them. The Prince and his com.- panion had, however, both succeeded iu jumping out safely before the coneussion took place, and a numaberof passers-by sprang quickly forward and stopped the horses before they also came to harm. This sudden vagary of the post horses seems to have arisen from some lively reminiscences they entertained of a former stable of theirs at the bottom of the steep street,
The National Zeitung of this place warns its readers not to be misled by the glowing quotations of the new Russian railway shares which the Hamburg and Amsterdaa share lists exhibit; private accounts, from Hamburg more particularly, show that the orders which brokers of that place are receivingin considerable numbers for the purchase of shares tally in a very remarkable degree with the orders they get to sell, and which come to themn from the same quarter. The inference drawn from this sudden amount of business done, and the rise that -is thereby effected, is that it is chiefly tranlsacted by P ig dealing with Pork, two individuals who are wel' mnown to billbrokers and stockjobbesrs as operating generally fortheir own ''accommodation"' andadvan-. tage. Of the last Russian loan that was raised I have been assured that the best purchaser in the market was Hope, of Amsterdam. The Russian railway shares have as yet made no sensation here.
Last year's harvest in the north of Finland appears from* all accounts to have faUen far short of the wants of the popullation, and, apparently fromn the d'ifficulty of communication aes winter approached, the scarcity that already existed at the commencement'of the winter has now increased to the extent of afearful famine. The subscriptions that were raised in St. Petersburg and Moscow for the sufferers by this famine produced about 70,000 ronblcsilver, bat this amount, although aided by contr'butions frofn Sweden, has long been exhausted. In Helsingfors itself a single merchant gave 10,030, and Baron Stieglitz 5,000 roubles silver. Unfortunately much of the grain that was forwarded to the coast of Finland from other parts of the Russian empire was detained by the vessels being frozen up in1 theice, and the slow process of conveyance by land was obliged to be resorted to. The Imperial magaznes in the south of Finland were opened a month or two back, but the difficulties of communication with the distant localities where the dearth was at the highest have prevented the aid coming jn time. The poor creatures were at that time living on a bread composed of barkandstraw. In theneighbourhood of Uleaborg the famine seems to be making great ravages; half-starved chi7dren are wandering all over the Country begging sustenance for themselves and their parents, and numbers of adults had aready fallen victims. All round about Oesterbotten, in the open country, the famine is driving the country people in half-famished bands starving with cold and hunger into the towns, where the available resources are in consequence boon consume&.
On the other side of the Gulf of Bothnia, in the north of Sweden, it appears to be as bad; among the Lt3planders the famine has already attained such a pitch that the Landeshauptmann of Norbotten, who prcceeied thither to inquire into the st..te of the case, al'irmus to have seen children who had gnawed their own han(ds from hunger, and adults who had died from starvation, while striving to prolong life with handfuls of straw. It is only very lately that any intelligence of this melancholy stat
of things in the north of Sweden hat obtained any mention in the Stockzholm papers, and now that all at once the most feaifnl extreme of misery is statedto exist there various journals seem disposed tO call the truthfulness of the accounts into qnzsiion, apparently because they have not yet received offlcial corroboration. It is, howrever, true that the Swedish Government has baen nuremnitting in its endeavours to affiord relief to the distressed districts ever since September last, and has already expended more than 80,00:) thalers in the work, and at length (the 18th inst.) the official journal rosttidraigns. has published a number of parfricuU,rs fully establishing the melancholy truth and i'itended to showF that the Government has neglectc i no imu-s to remedy the eviL.

MURDER AT DEAL.-On Saturday morning Ensign
MuRDER AT DEA.-On Saturday morning Ensiga M'Carroll, a young officer of the 44th Regiment, the dep jt of which is at present stationed at Walmer b-rracks, was murdered near the Naval-yard. It appears that Mr. M'Carroll was found at about 5 o'clock in the morning lying upon the beach in front of the Naval-yard in a dying state. with his skall fractared, a deep gnsh oa the side of his head, and one of his fingers much injured. He was immediately attendedlby Mr. Mason, surgeon, who had him conveyed at once to the Naval Hospital, bht, notwithstanding every attf ntion paid to him, he expired at about 9 o'clock, having be en insensible from the time that he was first discovered. In the course of the day a man named Samuel Baker, the landlord of a publichouse caUed the Ship, upon the Naval Esplanade, was apprehended, and charged with the inurder. He confessed that the unfortunate deceased wont to his house oetween 1 and 2 Oclock in the morning and asked for something to drink, which Mrs. Baker refused to give him, whereupon he struck her with his cane and immediately left the house. Mr. Baker followed him, and admits that he overtook him and knocked him down. A coastguardsman who was on dnty in front of Mr. Baker's hours states that Baker came to him at an early hour ila the morning, and asked him if he saw a man leave the house, and in what direc'ion he had gone. On telling him, Baker went into his own house, and returnei with some weapon in his hand, with which he followed in the direction the young officer had taken, and on returning shortly afterwards exclaimed, " I have given him something that he won't soon get over." The deceased was only 19 years of age. An inquest was convened yesterday afternooa. and was adjourned until to-day. An examination also took place beforo the magistrates at the GUildhall, which was adjourned.

The English funds hve b teady ntl&y atg the mproved quotations of yesterday. Atone time therb was a further advance, but it was not maintained to the close. Consols for money opened at 93k to -, and went to 93k to J, at which they remained till near the termination of business, when thev returned to the opening price. For the 8th of Apiil the last transactions were at 93k to i, and for the new account in May, 94i to f.

Foreign stocks opened with heavinss, but sab3r. quently exhibited greater firmness. Turkish Six per Cents., which on Saturday were last quoted 981, were frst dealt in to-day at 971, and were afterwards purchased at 971 and 98k foo money, and 98i and i for the account. The Four per Cents. Guaranteed were negotiated at 101i and 101.

In the corn-market this morning there vwas a decline of 2s.
100,0001. in bar gold was taken from the Bank to-day for the continent.
The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 70f. 30c. for money, and 70f. 50c. for the present account, showing a decline of an eighth.
The letters from Paris state that the bullion in the Bank of France has increased 710,0001. within the last fortnight, the total now held being 9,600,0001. Under these circumstances, it has been resolved from the 3d of April to reduce the premium offered for gold from 6 per mile to 4. As soon as the stock of bullion shall amount to 12,000,0001. artificial purchases are to be entirelydiscontinued. In the rate of discount, it is said, there is no probability of any immediate reduction, the demand for discount being active. On the Bourse likewise, money is in great request for the approaching monthly liquidation. A ramour has been circulated that the Government are about to pay off their debt of 1,600,0001. to the Bank.
It is stated to have been already ascertained that the French capitalists will not be able to find a market at Paris for their first subscription of 2,500,0001. to the Russian railway scheme, aud that they are to be relieved by sendmg Lome of the amount back to St. Petersburg, where the demand, which can of course be manufactured to suit the exigency of the occasion, is said to be very great.
The quotations of the India and China exchanges to-day are slightly less unfavourable. There has beena decline of i per cent. at Bombay, and of 1 per cent. at Calcutta. At Canton there appears to have been no material alteration, although the tendency was downward, but at Shanghai the rate had receded from 6s. 8d. to 6s. 7d.
The commercial advices from New York this week describe an average fall of aboat 3 per cent. in the principal railway stocks. Erie had rcceded from 53k to 53i, owing to unfavourable traffic returns for the past quarter, and this had affected most other descriptions. Reading was quoted 80; Panama, 95; N rew York Central, 89; and Illinois Central, 137; the bonds, 10I4 to 102. Out of the 140,000 shares of the Ilinois Central it appears 67,730 are now held in England. Thore was nothing new in the general markets. The specie brought by this packet, 61,0001., is al ron account of the Bark of France. Accounts had been received from Cuba to the 1st of March, stating a belief that at the close of the present sugar crop it will be found that the surplus profit for the year has reached 8,000,0001. Under these circumstances the bpwculations in the slave trade, which have lately lrrgely increascd, were expected to receive a farther extraordinarv stimulus. The price has doubled since 1854 notwithstauding the large importation of Chinese labourer-, whose position and suferings are simil"v to those of the negroec
The rate of discount at Hamburg has risen to 6 per cent. in conmcquenco of the withdrawal of silver from the Bank for Vienna.
A meeting of the British Amuerican Land Company took place to-day, MXr. J. J. Cununius preriding, when the report and accounts were adopted. It was mentioned that the results of operations during 1856 have been more favourable than the directors had reason to expect, considering the scardity of money in Canadla and the dulness in the eastern towasihips. The state of the accounts, however, will not justif.y the declaration of a dividend, and a distribution will therefore be postponed until remittances arrive. TMe profits for 1856 have been 7,7581., and the general reserve fund is, including this amount, 18,0881.
At a meeting of the Turkish Gas Company held to-day the repo-t was adopted, and it was stated that, after an expenditure of 3,4021., there remains a balance of 5,5601., including interest. The outlay at presenthas been about is. per share out of the 2s. 6d. paid, but the directors do not propose immediately to wind up, as one of the board, "intimately connected wvith Turkey, will visit Constantinople next month on his owrn affirs, and will raport to his colleaga the result of his inquiries with rcgard to future prospcets."

Tho arrivals of home-grown wieAt were507qVbte_, of foreign only 3,609 quaxrrs. The moIug Supply from Kent and Bscex was fair, and in better onditon, bp; universal dullness prilcd, and though selec parecls wreo little cheaper, the general runs ouldnotbesold frely a, 2s. per qustter abatement. A similar deline was notedan new foreiga and low ruesian qualities, the scarcity of fne
amples koeping them nominalty at the r.me plceo.
Of flour the arrivals from the countar wero 18,850 saoks, with 335 sacks from abronaL Trade was verj heasy. lTorfolks wero reduced to 38&. and 39s., and Americau decliued 1&, to 2s. pr barre.
Foreign barley was abundant, there b3ing 16,921 quarters; but the Eaglish amounted to only 978 quetters. The latter, however, was a slow sale at Is. to 2s. leas money, and foreign w&s reduced 2B. to 3s. per quazter.
Malt participated in the general dulle and was s. pir quarter cheaper.
Of oats there were only 40 quarters of S3otch, and 811 quarters of English; from Ireland there were 3,013 quarters, and the continent, 21,841 quarters. PAc3tors oould only seU at ls. abatement on all qualities, and this reduction was occasionally exceedcd for low soIs.
Of English beans there were 753 quarters, of foreign only 155 quarters. Of peas there were but 103 quarters native, and 125 quarters frora Konigsberg. Both these pulse were about s. per quarter in buyers' favour.
Linseed, with only 210 quarters arrived, barely maintained its price.
In cloverseed there was rather more doing, but LtZather easier rates, though stocks are lght.
Trefoil was somewhat cheaper, as well as tares. Hempseed, mustard, canary, and other seeds unaltered.

COURT OIF QHAICUY. FREDAY. VApmya 27.
coX V. qlsUoP.
(Before ae LRDe JuSncFE of APPEAL.)
The question in this case, which was argued on the 2d and 3ad int., was whether a person contractiug for the purchase of aleaseholdproperty, and taking possession, but never obtuinIng an assignment, can be sued in equity by the landlord for the nonpayment of rent accrued during hi-i possession, and for breaches of covenant taking place during the same period. The Mlaster of the Rolls had overruled demurrer }o such a.bill holding such person to be liable.
MSr. Lloyd and hfr. Shapter appearcd for the appeal ; Mr. Boundell Palmer agai Mr. Ihslop Clarke supported the decree of the Court belowr.
Lord Justice KscGsm BRuce considered that there was in such a casetno contct between the landlord by reason of the possession and enjoyment by the equitable assignee, and if the landlordhad any remedy it was at law, and not in this cour6. The demurrer must be allowed, overruling the deeision of the Master of the Rolls.
Lord Justice TuRNzr was of the sarao opinion.
1N B-YE RUPTCY-EX PASRTE BOULTON IN RE SXS'ETCHLEY.
This petition of appeal from a decision of Mlr. Commis. abner Ayrton was reported in Thre Times of the 7th inst.
r. Sket^hlev waRs the owner of shares in a company, as d b>ecame bankrupt in June, 1856. In 11M he deposited various certificatesorcouponawith the comparsyss asseurity for 800L No notice of this transaction was given to the
company, and the Commissioner decided that the shai"sdid I not re n in the order and disposition of the bankrupl, but belonged to the mortgagee ; the banuktpt being hire elf a secretarY tO the company, to whom, as such, the notice should have been giv&b, and being also the solicitor whose duty it was to give the aotice, the transa-tion of the deposit was complete.
Mr. Swauston and Mr. Hallett were for the appellant
Mr. Bacon and Mr. Baggallay supported the dec:sion of the
.ormmissioner.
Lord Justice KNIGHT BtRucE was of opinion that the ease was to be considered not . Athout reference to the 7th and 13th following clauces and the 150th elause of the Companies Clauses Consolidation Act, and that the railway shares wqre chattels within the meaning of the 125th section of W1e Bankrupt Law Consolidation Act. The only qaestlon, which was one not without difficulty, was whether the shares were in the order and disposition of the bankrupt ? But for the fact that Mr. Sketchley was a secretary the shares undoubtedly would havo been within his order and disposition, and bis Lordship thouo,ht that that fact made no difference. The notice he had was not in his character of secretary, but as shareholder, and the directors were not bound by it. The d;rectors had full authority, after the transaction and before the bankruptcy, legally, equitably, and safely to permit a transfer of the sbares to any person by Mr. Sketchley. The title of the assiguees must prevail, and the order of the Commissioner ceould not
stand.
Lord Justice TuRNsJ; ertirely coneurred in this opinion, but declincd to say whether, in his judgment, there could be a valid equitable mortgage of railway shares. The ap-
would be allowed, the order of the Commissioner obe. dwischarged, aud the assignees to have their costs out of the estate.
CA.MP'ELL V. CORLElY.
This case, fally reportcd ;n Thc Times on several days between the 17th and 22d of January last, was expected to strnd for judgment this morning, but it was not placed in the paper for that purpose.
r. DAML, on behalf of Mr. Corley, asked that their Lordshiips would permit the case to be further heard upon the additional letters which had been found in the boxes to which reference had been already made.
Lord Justice KNIGHT BRuCE qaid, that after a very foull hearing, and after the solicitors on both sides had had an opportunityofransackingtheboxes and reading letters as
Y as they pleased, it was really too bad to apply to the ' CoUTt, whose judgment hadbeen prepared, and was ready to be delivered, for further delay. There was no apology or excuse for such delay and inattention.
Lord Juistice TuRNER.-If a day shall be appointed,
which, if at all, will be with theg&reatest reluctance, do not let us have a second edition of this applic_tion when we have prepared our jadOment.
Mr. GRSEENE, on eh alf of Mr. Camp'ell, said, he and his leader were quite willing that their Lordships should gve their judgmentas the case now sted, withens; regard oe The newly discovered correspondence. If, however, the Court thought right lu alowv a further discussion, he pro. bumed that it would he confined to the new materials in esidence.
Lord Justice Kirurrr BReUCE.-Let the cause he further discus-ed upon the new matter-, and by only one counsel on each side, and let each side furn;sh the other vith a list of the letters he intends to rely upon by Easter eve.
* Mr. GRBzcI-Perhape your Lordship will more precisely
define the day?
Lord Justice KmIGHT BRB1JE.-The older Christian world know when that is.
Mr. GRExEN.-The two leuned gentlemen before me (Mr. Anderson and Mr. Ba2shawe) differ upon the point.
Lord Justice KNIGHIT BRUCE.-The time is quite sufficiently indicated. The cause may stand in the paper for the fourth day of next term.

This case was argued on the 18th of December and the 13th, 14th, 15th, and 17th of January last, and is a tithe suit (a mode of proceeding now somewhat out of uso) by the roctor of St. Maxys, Whbtechapel, to establish the important principle thaat tithes, or tithe rates, were pay-able for houses within the parish, both old and now. The biUl was filed by the Rev. William Welston Champneys against Thomas Bachan, Michael Canningham, Thomas Martyn, and George James, to recover certain sums of money alloeged to be payable as tithe rates to the plaintiff as rector of Wrhitechapel. The biUl stated that St. Mary's, Whitechapel, otherwise St. Mary's, MatfeUow, although not a part of the city of London, was witbin the liberties thereof and the suburbs, and in the county of Middlesex. In 1837 the plaintiff was presented to the rectory, aud, as such rector, claimed to be entitled to receive, half-yearly and by half-yearly payments, all tithes, rates of tithes, sums of money, eustomary payments, and other duties in lieu of tithes and ecclesiastical duties due by eustom, usage, and common right, or somo rate, compo:ition, or satisfaction for the said tithes, customary paymonts, or other duties in liou ef tithes, and all other dues and profits to the said rectory and parish church for the time being belong ng and payable by the inhabitants, owners, and occupiers of any houses, outhouses, shopa, cellars, warehouses, lands, and grounds within the said parish and other titheable place, t'iereof; and, in particular, to recover certain annual payments from and in respect of all houses and other buildings built or erected, and from time to time bu:lt or erectedand existingwithin the said parish; and to demand, take, and reeoive the said annual payments from the occupiers of the said houses and other buildings; that the defendants had been for. six years past inhabitants of the parish within the suburbs of the city of London (and not within the said city or the liberties thercof), and then ocespied, and had occupied for six years, as tenants or oa ners thereof, divers houses, outhonses, shops, cellars, warehouses, ands, grounds, and other hl.reditaments, situate within such part of the said parish as was situate within the suburbs of London, but not within the said oity or the libarties thereof; that the defendant Bnchan then occupicd and had occupied for six years, as o%wner or tenant, a dwellinghouse and shop with buildin-s in Mount-pla-s, witbin the suburbs, for which 12s. yearly had become due to the plaintiff in lieu of composition for tithes or as rate tithes, and, previously to six years then last pJ.t, the former occupiers of the dwellinghouse and premises, from the time the said shop and dwellinghon-e were erected, and a very considerable time prior to six years last past, paid to the plaintiff and his predecessors 12s. a-year by half-yearly payments for the tithes or in lien of and composition for t'thes, and a rate tithe for the said dwellinghouse and premises; and from the year 1818 and the year 1837 the defendant Buchan and the former occup:ers paid, in addition to the 12s., 2s. in respect of a brildiug erected on the yard occupied wth the said house; bhut the said Thomas Buchan had not from the 25th of Maroh, 1837, paid the 12s., or 2s. to the plaintiff, or to P.ny person for him, that tho defendant Cunningham occupied during six years past,'as owner or tenant, a dwellinghouse and buildings in Mount-street, within the suburbs, but not within the lFberties of the city of London, for which Ss. were now due to the plaintiff in hen of tithes, or tithe rate, and the said defendant, Michael Cunningham, and the previous occupiers from the time the said dwellinghonse was erected, and for a considerable time prior to six years past, paid to the plaintiff and his predecessors as rectors 8s. half-yearly as composition for tithes for the dwellinghouse and premises, hut had not from the 29th of September, 1541, paid to the plaintiff, or any persom for him, 8s. or any part thereof- that the defendant, Thomas Martyn occupied, and had oecupied for six years past, certain premises with buildings in Vhitechapel-road, called Road-side, within the suburbs, but not within the liberties of the city of London, for which 10s. and 8s. yearly were due, and nowdue tothe plaintiffinlieu or in composition for tithes; and from the year 1766 Ss. a-year had been paid by the anccessive occupiers of a part of the premises, and for new houses other part, and built in 1827, 10s. a-year were pad in addition;arl the several occupiers immemorially and for a long time prior to ai x years pastpaid to the plaintiff and his predecessors, as recuors of the parish, 8s. a-year, halfyearly, inrespectof the originally huiltprem;ses, andafarther sum of 10s. in respect of recently erected premises ; but Thomas Martyn had not during six years past paid to the
laintiff any sums nor to any person for him; that the deLendsnt George James was the occupier of a dwellinghouse and shop in High-street, Whitechanel, in the subutbs, but not within the liberties of the city of London, for which 14s. became due yearly in lieu of and as a composition for tithes or tithe rate, and that for a very long time prior to the year 1818 8s. were annually paid in respect of such louse and premise pby the successive occupiers tlereof;and, on eonsequence the erection and addition of new buildinU8 and improveient of the said premises, 1s. a-Tear were paid in respect of them from the year 1818, and for a long

The defendants, by their answers, denied that there was any titheable place in the parish of Whitechapel, and said that the revenues of the church consisted of Baster offerings, as was admitted by the plaintiff himsef. No tithe-books were produced between 1731 and 1748, or for the year 1757, and none between 1774 and 1786, or between 1802 or 1804, and nol constat, and that the tithe-books not produced would show the true nature of the revenues Tbo defendarit Buchen's ease wes that he had occupied No. 11, Mount-place, for 20 years; that such house was built 49 3 ears aLgo on Whitechapel-mount, being waste ground antil built upon. He could not explain under whiat circumstances he made the payments on the 10th of July, 1832. of 10s. 6d. ; on the 16th of Febiuary, 1833, of ys. ; on the 3d of August, 183, of 7s. ; on the 20th of February, 1834, of 7s. ; on the Ilth of July, 1835 of 14s.; and on the 12th of December, 1839, of 14s. ~but the collector who used to collect for the rector co0lectea also the asse.'sed taxes, aLnd the defendant paid the amount demaxnded without examirang the pairticulars, and under the imnpres~sion thait the amiount was forassessedtaxs andlocal dues, and notas tithes; except the above payments naothing had been paid in respect of tithes, and the only building upon the premises wes a workshop, which he built inI1832. The defendant Cunningham statedI that his house, 11, Mount-street, was built 40 years since on Whitechapel-mount, where persons who died of the plague where buried ; that this land was watsb-
until 47 years ago. On the 13thi of December, 183Q, and 9th of June, 184, he was applied to by the colleotor for the rector for 4s, for two years, and paid the same, and the collector gave two receipts ; that he never was applied to before or since, and none of his predecessors ever, to the best of his belief, made any payments to the rector. The defendant AMartyn stated that he had occupied his houses for 15 years, Nos. 210, 211, and 212, Whitechspel-road, and Nos. 1, 2, 3, anid 4, New-road ; that the house had been built for 27 years, and he bad been informed that nio customary payments were ever made to the rector for buildings formerly standingon the same site,and he was told on entering: that no tithes were payable. Six years aLgo he was applied to by the collector, and on refusing to pay was told that the payment -was optional In 1827 a new house was built on the siteo of the premises occupied by him, and he had not paid anything for tithes. The defendant James had occupied his house for 12 years, No. 3, High-street. The premises were very ancient, and no tithes had been paid to the rector by himh. A large mass of evidence -was gone into on both sides. The Mounti was said tohavebeen the burialplace of thosewho died of the Great Plague of 1665, and a deposit for the rubbish of the Great Fim in 1606. The affidavit of Mr. W. Black, late assistant keeper of records, spoke to the chief points. In the taxation of Plope Nicholas, in 1292, Stepney was taxed as a rectory at 401., and a viearage at
O1. Whitechapel was not mentioned therein, raising the
inference that in 1292 Whitecbay el Church war not founded, hut that the paLrish was a p art of Stepney, and not of imn memorial antiquity. 'In 1329 Hugh, son of William do Fulboia, wi's presented by the Procurator-Gener-I to the Irectoiy of Stepney and to the church in Whitecbapel. In 1.336 John, of Londoni, presented to the rectory of 'W hitechapeL In Newcourt's Repce-to-ium XccWeia8ticum, P-arochi2fc Londonesets, which was a register of the diocezri of London, it appeared that W'hitechapei was a rectory and a qucom chapel of eas to Stepney, the earliest rector being Richa-rd de Carnpdene. In the Inquisition of Yl1ths, 13406 the church of Senoy was mentioned, as being taxed at 4 I., but there was nio mention of the rectoi of 9 -le capela. In" "Payne v. Cowse," an agreement had been made that the Vic-,r of Stepney should pay ta- the rector of Whiteohapel 81. 12s. for a tithes, and the same had been always?paid. This agreement was dated in 1488, but counld not be found ; but it explained -why Whitechapel was not named in the inaquisition of Ninths. In the suit of "1Payne v. Cowse" one John Thompson, a witness, saidl that he ha been told by RlWph Davenant, in 1681, the then rectox of Whitechapel, that it was inicluded in the parish of Stepney, and that the separation took place about 1337, which agrecd with the date of the first induction in the regiitry of London. The tower of the church bore evidence of being built about the year 1300, and not before. It appeared by the Valor Ecdesiasticsc (26 Renmy VIIJI), that the recfory wss wol lh 311. 17s. Sd., andl by an ancient map of London (made in exhibit), 1784, tho siS-e of the houses of the dofendants, Buchan and Cunninghami, was marked as waste. In the tithe beaks for 1731 the Mouant was maentioned, and 4s. -was charged, but in 1804-5 and 1806 no mention wasrmade, andbhlnks were left for it. In 1807-8 h1ount place and terrace -were pnentioned-12s. in respect of a house in the terrace, end 8s. in respect of the strCet. In 1818 there was an increase of charge, and in 1848 there was a charge for proedia tithes of 11. per acre of land, and 80.3. for Red Lion-gardens, 4s. for Mo-utfield, lOs. for empty ground, and l6s. f or a stableyard. In 1849 the rector abandoned these claims, and then renewed them, and there was no demand for Easter offerings for 15 -years.
Mr. Fleming and Mr. Lindley apue-rcd for the plaintiff; Mr. Bailey, Mr. W. Buxton, and Mlr. Holroyd for the dofendante.
TIre VICE-CwIA?CELLoiR referred to the above facts with considerab)le miinuteness, and said, that it was necessary to cornider on what ground the pla'ntiff was entitled to his demnand. It was plain that a rector was not entitled de comnmuni jus-c to pyment of tithes 5n respect of houses ; but the occupiers ofrhouses might be liable in one of three ways, -first, by svedus affecting the land on which the house was bu5lt ; secondly, by a custom in the pearish ; and thirdly, by a presription affect-ng the pzrticular house. It might be that before the house was built a modus existed in resp- et of the land and stood in lieu of tithes in lkind, and, if so, the building of the hou'e would not depriv'e the rector of his right ; but the payment was niot in respect of the house hut the land, which would te equally liable whether the house were there or not; and, in fact, it was a proper farm modvs, and there were instances of that in 3 Wood's Dccre p.. 9, and 3 G. A house, though not titheable de communi j~ure, might be so by custom, by which the rrcator wi's entitied to receive an annual paiyment from the ocoupiers of any houses by way of tithes ; but it was nuesesa,y to distinguis;h between custom and -modus; it was then called indeed a modius decimnandi ; but that was not coizect, for the laI resumed in the case of a 2rodis that at some timie Ieyond legal mnemory, tithes were payable, and a modrcs did not create a, liability, so that if there was no modus there was no liability; on the contrary,
acustom presupposzd an or',gnal liability. Meducs was applicable only to things titheabea Common law, so th-t if there was no custom there was no liability, and the same custor.s which created this liability miust also prescribe what was payable and in what manner. Another way in which occupiers of houses were liable to pay an annal.- sum wat by prescription ; although thero was no general custom in the parish or district, the recoWr might be entitled toa Prescription that from time imnmemorial pe
sons had been in the habit of paying. But the house mnust have existed from time immnemorial on the same site, and the principal difference between prescription 'and cp'stoya wi's that cui%omn apPlied to all, and pre cription only to the noarticular house, the two cases being the sf%ne sa to the original liability to tithes, and it there was no custom nor prescription there was no liability. In one or other of there ways the holders of houses must bo liable. and besides these his Honouir knew of no others, TI'e
laintiff had not stated on which of these grounds he rested
title, and perhAps it was considered safer to leave it opn,s that the counsel might elect the ground which he thought moot sustainablie, and thus it must be infeirred that the defendants were soughit to be made liable on one of those grounds, althou"h perhaps each on different ones, or if not, no ibe ata. The case of a moducs vas out of
the tinfo it was incredible upon the evidence of thec ooks th" each roed of land should be subjctoaseparate faim msodus, it would be bad from rankness3 the rector claimed in respect of distinct buildings, which was at variance with the idea of a fax-a snodu.s, which was irrespective of the erection of buildlings ; indeed, the plaintiff's ese (lid not rest on the ground of ssodus. As to the cwse of prescription, James was the only defendant against whom the evidence was available. It wa-s essential that the house should have existed from time ima. m6moripl, or some house on that si~e. It appeared on the evidence that the ho-'ses of the first two defendants were erectedl within 50 years, and therefore there was no prescription a, to them; but as to James's house, for anythiing appearing to the contrary hie house had stood there from timie imnmemaorial, andI that was not improbable, as it stood No. 3, High-street, on the boundary of the city ; and if the payments during 120 years had been unifonri, on the authority of " Beresford v. Newton" (1 Cromp, Mees., and Iloscce, 901), it mnuat have been presumed that the plaintiff had a prescriptive title against James. But such a solution was impossible on the facts stated on the bill, for the paymnents varied. Tithes were only payable on things yearly
grwig but by custom on maines and quarries, although the mfinerals were part of the corpues, andL so for hon.es. His Honour then referred to IIDr. Grant's Case" (11 Coke', 16), which was in its reasoning, he thought, very unsatilsfactory,
an,in fact, unsustainable, although righ, ta uhac
ommight he valid; but if it varied with the rent it was bad ; and also to numerous other caLes onth same- noint--
ne paln mnust sustain a custom throughout the par.;sh by which houses, whenever built, bec^me titbeable, and it was essential to its validity that it should be cer tain and definite on each house, and not merely showing the norma decimandi. The bill was silent on that point, and the case was argued on a special custom, and courmel had obligingly stated the allegation to be that occupiers of houses buRll, and irom time to time built, within the parish, sbould pay the rector a certain annual sum for tithes, and sr.h as had been usually paid when the period of erection was known, and when not known, such as had been paid in respect of old homses, or such reasonable annual sum as should hb agreed upon between themselves and the rector; and, if not. to be ascertained by the amount payable for houses of a like description in the neighboirhood thereof. Without bejna
critical, supposing this was contained in the bill, was it vald? It appeared to him (the Vice-Chancellor) to lack the quality of certainty. As to the agreement with the rector, that 'was void, and the second was void also for uncertainty, He had searched long, and in vain, for anything approaching to a rule on the subject. What could be the test of alike description? Was it alue,material, or structure, or a combinafion of all? In the time of Henry VIII. there coild not have been more than 140 houses in the parisb, assuming all the profits of the living came from liouses-probably not 100, and now there were thousands; but there was no ratio decimandi in the tithe books nor the evidence ofrany living witness of the custom, though houses were erected within the time of maemory-no terrier, or written instrument. The Parliamentary Survey pointed to rate or rental, but the plaintiff did not rest his case on that. The evidence and suits on the subject did not prove acustom. The plaintiff did not allege it, wlhich the rules of pleading require, and it was unjust that defendants should have to ar:-wer an uncirtain claim. N'r r--'f-d. vwna thc.refore, pro.

MCATEIAS V. MITHIAS.
Th&'VICX-CHSCXLL0R this mnorning gave judgment in this ae,whcwaag din December len, andl wbich' came oni upon excetions to the M1aster's report. The tee. tatein he-aus,-v wil4 dated April, 1814, after.devisin~ his real esahtes in W-ales to Charles Mlathias for life, wIt
remainder to Lewis Mathia's for life' ithi remainider t6 the sons of 1awis Mathias instal, ? 1 ,AM. to trustes to be Md out intthe puvcae -of UadiA6iavi)settled to the same Vses as his devised estates, and he bequeathed the residue of his personal propei by to Cbarles Mathipss The tesa&tor died in 1815,. and the executora and trustees of his .will having renounced, adminisitration to Mis efbeots was taken ouat by Charles Mathiaa, who, after the testator's deeaso bougbt tbe Iamnphey and other estates situate in WaI16 folr 49,7731., out of personal estates belonging to the testator, and took a conveyance -of those estates to himself in fee simple. In 1851 Charles Mathiss died, bsaving devised the LamZphey estate, which was now said to be worth ispwards of 60,0Ojl to his son Lewis Matbias in fee simple, arid all his other estates . hle gave to. his other chlidren, xho were parties to the cause. Charles Mathia bad built a lrgemasio onth Lanphy stae.Lewis Mathias and
hisso, wsewasteantintai uderth orgialthestatohey
estae sould be taken in satisfRation of th 000.direted to be laid out in land as before mentiond
Mr. Bacon, Mr. Malins, Mr. Elnixley, Mr. Pitman, Mr. riggott, aiid Mr. Bevir were counsel in the case.
TXhe VicS-CuANOELLoic.-The object of the bill is to have the Lamphey. estate taken as a satisfaction ef.the trust for investing 50,CCO1. in land as directed by the wil of Lewis_`Mathias, or, in the alternaLtive, to have the 50,0001. now raised out of the assets of Charles Matbias, with a Hien on all his real estates, hut so as to have the Lamphey estate first resorted to for satisfying the lieui. By his report the Master has found that the Lamnphey estate, together with 'the Kersegan auid - Escalwen estates, -were purchased by Charles Mathias with personal estate of the testator Lewis Mathias, in execution or discharge of the trust for investment of the sum of 50,OC)l. The aggregate amount of the moneys invested by Charles Mathias in the puchs of these estates the Master ftnds to have been 49,7731. As.t
trustees in the will of 3-ewis Matbias did not accpt the trust, it must be taken- that Charles Matbias as the adminstrater with the will annexed had the duty and the responsibility of performiing the trusts for Investinig the r0,0001. in the purehAse of la-nd. He was also residniarv legatee of the personal estate, as well as tenanitfor life of the estates to be purchased ; but until he had appropriated or invested the 50,0001. he had no igt to apply for his own benefit any,--part of the residue. The Master had foond that the personal estate amounted to 80,0001.,,after pa.yment of thedeohs. The will directed *he 50,0001. to be invested in the purchase of landl with all convenient speed after the-death of the testator. As this case is one in which the purchase-s have been mnade by the 'trustee by means of -the trust moneys in his lis.nds, it is stroig.-beyond the ordinary eases in which a presumption has been hield to arise that the purchases were made with a view to execute sn obligation. ln "1Lechmiere v. Lechmnere"' (2 Sugd4m'8 Vendors and -Purchasers, 2d cdl., 3,117), Lord Talbot said :
"Where a luau Is under an obligation to layout f£10.00 in lan-is, and he lays out part sa he can dLnd purcha-es vchi *re attended witha all material circumlstancoes, it Ig more natural to auppose these Durchews mnade with reilard to this ohliratlon than withiout it;
more natural to ascribe it to the obligation he lies under thanu te voluntary wct Independent of the obli3ation."
IHere there are no facts proved which show that the pur. eba-es were maade for any other purpose, and it is beyond csuesition that they were made out of the money devoted, by the testator to that investment. All that was exacted for the complete performance of the trust was the execution of a settlement to the uses declared by the will. Tak5u,g the conveyancee to himself in fee, and so as to have an absolute .-interest Inste-ad -of au estate for life only as directed by the will, was a breach of the trust ; but taking the conveyance in fee has -not beenL held in such ea-ses to intirfere ilith the rights of the remaindermnen. ln "1Deacon v. Smith" (3 Atkyns, 326) Lord Hardw5ckce, spealdng of the conveyaLnce being taken in fee, says, "1If there is a sufficient presumption it was the intention to go according to the articles, the law is bound by the art4cles.)' So in this case, where the trust moneys are applied to make the purchase, the persows interested in the performance of the trust have a right to attach the uses declartid by the will to) the lad purchased, and to comp3la settlement and conveyance according to the -uses declared by the will. On the first -impresson it seemed to me that the Master had gone too far in finding that these three estates were purchased in "executiona or dischz'rge"l of the trust *for investment. Exit it appears +blat ho has only adopted the words of the decree, As the trust would only be completely executed and discharged by the executionx of a settlement to uses and purposes dleclared by the will of -Lewis Mathias, and as it won7 certain at the hearing of the cause that no such settlement or conveyance to the use of the wil had been executed, the Court, by directing the inquiry whether the purchases were maade "1in execution or discharge of the trust for investment," probably used these words only in the sense of their being purchases made with the view and for the purpose of performing the trust, so as to give the remaindermen a right to claim the estates as subject to the settlement directedl by the wilL. In " Lechinere v. 1echmanre," as in the pro. sent case, the conveyance was taken to the purchaser in fee, and not to the use of the settlement. But Lord Talbot said, "It is true a settlement hath not been made, hut they were bought with an intention to maake a settlement, and you can mnake one." The ease is much stronger where the purchase is made with trust moneys actnuely inpre&: I with a trust to make the purchase than where, as in "1Lech. mere v. Lechmere"1 and miost of the other eases, there was onl a general obligation by covenant to purchase laNds, and no particular fund dedicated to that purpose. In suport of the exceetions the case of Price v. Blalcemore"1 f6Ba.)was relied on, as showing that the remaindermen could only claim a lien for the sum of 50,0001. But in "Pnce v. Blakemore" only one single est.te had been purchased for a prCe which was double the amount to be invested . There were no menus of aKpportioning the estate or of fairly satisfying the rights of the ce-stsui que trusts otherwise than on the principle of lien. In the preset ease the debts of the purchasers and the amounts of the moneys invested relieve the case fromn anysuehdifficulty. The arrangement onx the purchase of
teEsccdsven Estate; by which a prtion of it was settled to other uses, leavin that part which was purchased for 9,8451 free, so as to settled to the uses of the will, rather tends to support the finding of theXMater; and the letter of Mr, Thomas Mathias, of the 6th of Januar, 1821, in which he says that par-t of the property was .to no conveyed to the uses of the will, must, from its date, refer to the Escawen purchase, If,sas is clear, the moneys invested in the purchases were the trust maoneys, and the circumstances attending the purchases of the three estates at the date of the purchase are enough to attribute them to the performance of the trust, the trustee can have no right to deal with these estates as to alter or p-rejudice the rights of the re. mnaindermen. If t'he trusts impressedi upon the moneywere attached to the estates in which the mnoney was inivested, the trust-ce can have no right to make any change at his own option, or so to deal with the puirchased estates as to deprive the persons interested in the purchase of their rights and interests in the purchased estate. Therefore the nttem,pt mapde by the devise in the wil of Charles Mathias to compel the remainder maen either to take the Lamphey estate in satisfaction Of the trust or to recover only the 600O0OI is nugatorY, because it is inconsistent with the pricipies which regulate inx this counat the duties of trustees and the rights of ceesui que trusts. The Counts have gone very far in caense of thiskidnd to give the trust estate the benefit of the investment, even where the money has b:eon invested in a mnanner unauthorized by the trust. Lord Eldon and Lord Redesdale, in the ease of "1Phague v. Peree," in the House of Lords (3 Dow., 128), laid it down as clear law that the trustees can never deal with tine trust fund for their own benefit. Lord Redeadale said that the father, T7ho was only tenant for life, could not take the purchase for his own benefit solely, and that his purchase of lep3ehold p.opeity, although unauthorized by the trust, being a beneficial purchase, the benefit miust belong to the trus fund. Bomne difficulty occurs in the present case as to the expenditure by Chbarles Mfathias On the LamPhey estate. Any increase in t1ie value of the estate from the falling in of leases cannot be taken into accotnt. That is a benefit to which the remaiindermen are entitled. But expenditure to a very large amount in erecting a mnausionhouse made under a masespprehension that it might inerease the value so as to have that estate alone taken in satisfaction of the trust may possi'blv entitle the persons claimainig underL the wfi of Charles Ma~issW to some allowance in respect of that expenditure. That, however, is a difricalt question. According to the decision ina the caseoOf c"Bostoeck V. Blakeney" (2 Bro., 0.0.), expenditure of that kind could not be taken in satisfaction. of any part of the trust for investmlent. But where the whole trust fund has been properly laid out it is a very different question how far a large expenditure in excess of the fund, if honestly made uander a mnsapprehen. sion,imay give aclaim. This bill is not framed wth a view to any rehief on that ground ; nor is the finding of the Master as to the amount or circumstances of the expendi. ture sufficient to enable the Coutrt now to adjudicate upon any such claim; hut, as the evidence supports the finding of the Master's report unon all the poinxts to which the exception are taken, they maust be o-verruled.

INT THE .ATTEP OF R sW:Awoas TRUST AND OF THE
TPRUSTEE RllIF ACT.
The VrbCE-OdrToELLoR delivered judgment in this case, which was argued on Tuesday. The question arose between the assigneesi'n insolvency andh the assignees under a subsequent bankruptcy of John Edward Rawbene to a portion of the fund in court, which had been paid in by the trustees of the wil under which his title arose. This fund represented a residue bequeathed by the testator to his widow for life, and after her decease to be divided between their tw od cidLren, of -whom John Edward Rtawbone was one. The dates were as follows .-The testator died in 1828. John Edward Rawbono took the benefit of the Insolvent Act in 1842. and afterwards became bankrupt in 1854. is mother, the tenant for life, survived till 1856. No notice appeared to have been given to the trustees of the will either by the assgnees under the insolvency or under the bankruptcy. The trustees in December last paid the fund into court, and the question now came before the Court on a petition presented by Mr. Sturgis, the provisional assignee in insolvency, for payment out to him of the bankrupt's moiety, which was opposed by the assinees in bankruptey on the ground that inasmuch as John ward Rawbone might, after his insolvency, have parted with his (then) reversionary interest for value, it must be taken to have been within his order and disposition at the time of his bankruntcy, and must thus have passed to the assignees under tbat nankruptcy.
Mr. Osborne apjpeared for the petitioner- Mr. Cracknall for the assignees m bankruptcy ; and Mr. Waler and fr. C. H. Chambers for other parties.
The IcR-CHANcnLoR decided in favour of the petitioner, Mr. Sturgis. Ris Ronour said he had been unable to meet M ith any autbority precisely in point. The nearest caie was "l.av aare Ne'ton" (4 Dcacen and Chi',ty, 138j,

iot-to b thnthebOrdeO-and -disjostlon oifto t'he aurkipt. Some observations had been there fnade as to whether a reversionay - interest could ever be held to be within the clause of " order sdn disposition," policies of assuranoe haing been held to be so., No instanoe, however, was to be found of property like this having been so held. . No doubt a faevernionary interest might be dealt with by assigninent, so that it would pais to a purcbaser for value; but finding no autbority for she proposition contendcd for, his Honour said he was not disposed to mnake the-first decision bringing such property 'within section 8of the BauxptcyAct. DUring the lifetime of the tenant forlife the banlrupt could not in -any way have made himself master of this reverbionary interest, - whichiremained vested in the trustees, except by obtaining
a money value for it. At the time of the bankruptcy, therefore, it was clearly no' within his own order and asspositio'n. His Honour, after adverting to the question of notice, and observing that a reversionary interest was distinguishable from a policy of assurance, wbich was an iitmediate contract in the nature of a chose ih action in ths hands pf the assured, although the fruits of such contract were future, made a declaration in favour of the petitioner, the assignee in insolvency.
His VoXouvn, after dispbsingof a few short matters, rose fortheEastervacation.

In 1855 the seven years exp'red, and, having attained 21, Blackehaw, who was stiU in Autralia, gave a general power of attorney to T. S. C.

Death Of Mr. John M. Kemble.-It is with
DoF' MB. JORN M. XiiusLE.-It is with sincere soirow that we-aDnounce ther d.-ceaie of Mr. John hitchell Kemble. the eminent Anglo-Saxon scholar and archbologist. Hehad heen attacked about a fortnioht since by infimmation of the lungs, and though his naturaUy :trong constitution and excellent medical advice for a while seemed to baffle the diseame, he on Thursday sank under it. Mr. Kemble depaaked ths life at Graham's Hotel, Dnblin. He had repaired some weeks ago to that city for the purpose of collecting specimens of Celtic and Anglo-Saxon antiq.uities for the AlL bZrevssres Exhibition at Manchester, and there is reason to believe that the exertions he made in the cause he had so much, at heart-thehistorical antiquities of England-soved the seeds of the disease which has roved fatal to him. Mr, Keruble wAs thea eldest son of the late Mr. Charles Kemble and the distinguished name which he inberited he iUustrated still further by his own signal abilities and acquirements. He was educated partly by Dr. Richardson, the eminent etymologist and author of the wellknownc DiWoary of the Engli8h Language, and partly by Dr. Benjamin Heath Malkin, Master of Kinl ddward's Grammar School, Bury St. Edmunds. In 1826 Mr. K emble entered at Trinity College, Cambridge, and at the usual times took his degrees of Bachelor and laster of Arts. For a good many years Mr. Kemble was editor of the BrUi8h andi Foreign Qasarterly.Rcriew-a periodical of the highest class, vbich exercised considerable political and literary influence, but ceasd to exist about the year 1845. At the time of his decease he held the ofiae. of Examilier of Plays under the Lozd CUaclIi-.-LI:i c:y a.( ::.

1= E10U5x, lrb'D~am2ctsS Gertran, wa s brouvht ' fore the LORD MAYOR, charged with having feloniosly threatzcl to accuE, Asaer Stern of having set fre , bhig dwelling.hotlw,ith't-e view to extort moner.
Mr. Stern, waterproof manufacturer, at 47, WelJldoso. aqutre';d.-Iast Sunday wcek a fire broke out in my Ztoa mse in A'tr-e, in my aberoce. I heard of it on my return at 8o clock in tlso evening. The Pre was, as I bc. lieved, put out, but -at Muthalf-an-hour afterwards it brolco cut a-kin, and bur-nt and destra-1 aboat 4CO1. worth of
Iws insured in the W'est of EnSland Fire-office. Idd aU I could to assist -in putting out tho fie and to xavo my propemty. I employed Mr. Runter to tnake out my account claiming the iompensation from the offioe,. and that cir5in tas b:en admittcd on the part !of tep office. I have- known the 'prisoner threo' months. He was inmy employment tiU tbe day of the fire, and after that Ihad no employment for him, and I believe be was out of work. About three orfourdsys after the fire he came to me and saidhewantedtospeakameI Isaid, "What do you want?" He said, "rwauttoaskyon for 12t." 'I asked him what for. He said, " If you don't give me 124 I1l go and report at' the office, and you'll get transported." He sad behad seen in the papera that I was insured in the West of England office and hesaid be would go there andsay that I sleot the Louse or fire. I rsaid to him, "You were not there nor wa I when the fire first broke out and you went Away, too, when it brcke out again." HeI id, Imm very hard up. rve got everything pawned. Im t have 12 or rl swear anything against you." I said he could go with me and saVte the ease to Mr. Hunter, and what he knew about it, and be went there with me and saw Mr. Hunter, but he did not ask me in the- presence of that gentleman for any money, but he wrote down eomething which Mr. Hunter read. Then the pisoner-¢igncd it and went away, and I did not see him agam till Thursday morain
when, es I left home, he came un, h vrDg apparetl been waiting for me. -He said e wanted to spea
to me. He maid, "I bear you've settled with the fire insurance-offic-; I want moncy." I said I had not got any and I ha&-mot receivcd it from the insurancC office, and if I had I could not give him ny. He said, " Now- is the last time m see you. mm going to the offic, and if I go there and aweari black --Is white rnd white is black you mast be transported e andif Iawould not give him b I mat give him 54, as he uonderston d I should not get so- much--from the Fire-office as ho bad first heard2 *nd I then made an appointment for himI to mIet me m the afternoon, and Isai Iewonld try and get the 5b and give it to bin. I want to the police station. The witness then stated theparticulsad of the plan for tose detecton of the prisoner, and the conversawin between them, which was heard by others, and mentioned that he had given to the prisonr two marked sovereigns, and his I 0 U for 3p, whtchamonSe and decument were found upon he prisoner by the police at t4oe station house ]
Mtyor Gol'cerg, a waterpDroofer. said,-I w;as at the house of teprosector when the ire broke out, I sawv the prisoner
i dy after the fire,gad he told me to tell Stern that if he did not give him 121 eh should bc transported I told hime if he could prove that Stern had set fire to the house himself hLe mu', go to the husuranoc-office and tell them, as I could slot do anythang about it myself with Stern. The prisoner sad he had pledged goods to the amount of 94w, and he wanted to get 31. more to take him to lHunbrtrg, and he wor'd not take a farth;ug less, He s-aid he could prove t'hat Stern had aet fire to the house hirnself.
Other evidenLe was brought forward confitmatory of tho statements given above.
Mr. James Hunter, auctionc3r and valuer, of 201, Whitechapel-road, said,-I was employed by Mr. Stern to make out his accounts for the claim upon the fire-office about the end of hLst week. I saw the prisoner with Ir. Stern, and he said three persons had called upon him to colleague with him to extort money from Mr Sten by charging him with setting fire to his premises, and I said I would reduce it to wrihng, which I did, and the prisoner signed the paper which I read over to him. Yesterday morwing I saw the prisoner aud the prosecutor together at my office, and the prisonerasked moto write outanlO U for5f. Iasked the prisoner "Wkatfor? Is it for waes;ordoes he owe you anything ?" He did -not at-first answez and I said I should notwriteit without knowing what it was for. He said it was to prevent him going tsp to the fire-office, and stating that Mr. Stern had aethis houe on fire. I said I shonld do nothing of the sort; and if I were Mr. Stern I would give him into custody for attempting to extort money. I ordered him out of my office..
The ptisoner made a long -statement, in which he said he couldprove that the prosecutor had set fire tohis house, and had given the money and the I 0 U to porchase silence.
The LoRD MAYOR committed the prisoner for trial; and havsng been informed,that.two other men who had accos - panied the prisoner and joined in a similar attempt to extort money from the prosecutor were in court, ordered that they
ould bo taken-into custody-and placed at the bar.
Barnet Greenbow and Mark Robinson (the persons alluded to) were then apprehended, and charged with havin
attempted to obtain money from 3r. Stern upon threats of earging him with having set fire to his house.
Several.witnesses were examined,- whose evidence went to fix the charge upon the prisoners as strongly as the evidence in the foFmer case had established the accusation against Abraham Rechthard.
The prisoners btated, snd seemed to place great relianeo upon the statement, that they had not received any money from the prosecutor, and they seemed to be quite shocked at hesiing that the mere threat with the view to extort money was an offence punishable by transportation for life. They said, upon being addressed in the usual terms by the Lord Mayor, that they would reserve their defence for their trial, and they were then committed for trial.
ZrALB0R0UGH-STP ET.-Ezmest Augustus Lloyd, an officer in the army, was chArged wvith obtaining goods under false pretenoes from tradesmen.
The pr'soner wes remanded for a week, but it was intiira i I y Mr. BxDoxn that good bail would be accepted.
In the.course of the day numerous inquiries were made by tradesmen relative to the prisoner.
O!{ver Neale was charged with forcibly stealing from the person of John Young his watch, value 104
Ihe prwoner reserved his defence, and was fully comInitted,.
WESTMWSrTM-Edvin Moseley, a cab-driver, appear-i to auswer twoo summonses charging him with unlawfully demanding more than his fare and using insulting lan-
ur. Charles Hagrcee, cashier at the South-Western department, Nine-elms, stated that on the nig&ht of the 22d inst. he engaged the defendant at the Man in the Moon,
Chelsea, rnd, wth a lady, as ddlven to the foot of VauxhrU-bridge, where defendaiit demanded 3s. as bis faxe. Complainant disputed its accuracy, and expressed his opinion that the drver was not entitled to more than half that amount, whereupon tHe latter declared that that was his fare and he would havi- it. Complainant refused to pay it, and offered to write his name and address in the toll-
hous of th!ebridge and give it to defendant, but the latter refused to go to the,toll-house, and, hsvitg hinted a disgraceful imputation, in which the lady involved, proposed driving the parties to the police-station in Rochegter-row, to which complainant willingly aszent-4, and, with the lady, got into the cab aain. Instead of tagng them to the police-station, lie drove down Milbank to a lonely spottopposite the Penitentiarv. and, putting his head in at the window, admitted thaths fare was only Is. 6d., and endeavoured to extort the further sum of Is. Gd. by a repetition of his previous inuendo, Adding "I don't wish to expose you, and if you like to get out r imsay no more about it." Complainant positively refused to alight, and, seeing two policemen eirectly afterwards, called to them and go. one to accompany him in the cab to the station, where the defendant eudeavoured to set up a claim for the overcharge by alleging that damage had been done to his cab.
The police on duty at the station proved that defendant mHde a charge a3ainst the Jady and gentleman seriously affctwing their moral character, and that no damage whatever had bcsn done to the cab.
The ALkGLSThTE obseived that defendant was too dangerous a fellow to be permitted longer to be a public carriage dIver, and sentenced bhi to two months'nard labour m the House of Correction and to forZeit his license, which would not again. be granted to him.
KILLING THE PRESIDENT.-Accounts from Wash-
KILaLIG THE PFMhENT.-Accounts from Washington infoim us that President Buchanan has been made seriously ill by the swarm of office-beggars which has congregated at the capih.L From Eastport to Oregon, from the
. Laawrence to the Rio Grande, these devouring locusts havetaken their flight and 8ettled upon the Executive mansion m incalculable numbers. The principle of rotation in office having been promulgatad in semi-official style, the new Administration is not only bored with tho,office. seekers but with the office-holders, vwho are all in an agony of suspence, which none but the placeholder with his head under the guillotine can know. This hungry mob storms the Prcsident's door and wll not allow him a moment of peeco. Mr. Buchanan has been famihar with the climate, the water, and other peculiarities of Washington for 30 or 40 years, and during that time he has been a hearty, robust man, and when elected to the Bresidency he was in the highest physical condition. A few days beforo the inauguration he visited the capitl and on returning to Wheatland wFas elightly affected with
n eideicpreallngat the capital, aud probably caused an idei pRrevaiing
ditrc by nu sdencanges. of the atmlosphere, for which the d snoed at this season. A few days' rest at Wheatbud restored the President to his usual state of health: but the fatigue of the joarney and the constant annoyance from office-beggrs, before and since the inauguration, have brought on a relapse of the complaint. It is hardly to be believedthat, although it is well known at Washington
at the President's ilness is a source of disquietude to his friends stDI the place-hunters persist in tornenting him in Ivory possible way, They would, if possible, forco themselves into his private apartments, and bore him to death about their petty village squabbles and small sinecures Your office-beggar Is the most persevering of bores-the :most hLngry oT Ieeches-'he most ravenous of rats. We trust that the men who are now bullying, boring, and tormenting the President will be sent about their business, such as it is, with vory sharp fleas in their very long ears.- New York HeraWl.

Children's Balloons.
CHILDAEN'S EBALLOONS
-0 THE ED1TOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I can fully confirm the injurious effects resulting from the colouring matter used in children's balloons, as set forth by your correspondent, Mr. W. J. Jones.
A small and very valuable favourite dog of mine bit one of these balloons while playing 'with my little boy ; it in. stantly collapsed, and the colouring powder issued from it The dog licked this up, and imm ediately after was seized with violent purging and sickness. A few hour afterwards the dog tore most violently about the house, dashing his head against the walls and fireplace, and on the door being opened ran out of the house and precipitated himself down an area of 12 or 14 feet in depth. He lay there with his eyes flashing like burning coals, and foaming violently at the mouth. A farrier was sent for, who pronounced that the dog must bo immediately killed, and all the foam scattered about the house be at once carefully removed.
My little boy was slightly bitten by the dog on his foreh a few hours after the poison was taken, and after these unpleasant results occumred I had the puncture cauterized. I am happy to say that no ill effects followed the bite, but I have to regret the loss of a most valuable dog, and would caution others to be very careful in the use of these dangerous toys, or they mayhave to deplore worseresults if the poison should be imbibed by children.
I sm, Sir, yours obedientlv.

THE IRISH BANKS.-The returns of the Irish
THE IRIs BAxsS.-The returns of the Irish banks of issue for the four weeks ending the 14th inst. show a decrease in the entire circulation of 80,6961., and a decrease in the coin held of 122,24R. The falling off in the circulation, although very trifling in amount, extends without exception to every one of the banks. InI the coin held there is an increase in the case of the Bank of Ireland and the Northern Bank, and a decrease with all the others. At this period of the year there is invariably a contraction in the circulation, and the diminution at the present moment is to a less extent than. usual ; lastyearitwas260,0001., and in 1855 135,0001. Fromthe analogy of former periods we may for the next four or five months, say until the approach of harvest, look for a gradual lessening of the notes in circulation, while in the coin held there would be no very material alteration, were it not that the sovereigns which were to such an extent, some few months since, brought over here to meet the run upon the banks in the south of Ireland, will be gradually finding their way back to England. The following figures will show the position of the banks iu the aggregate now and at the same period of the last fivo years:-
From the foregoing returns it follows that the Irish banks are now 818,715L above their authorized isse; but taking into acomunt the coin they hold, the amouant is 1,770,4MS below that allowed bylaw.
A " D CuTT` THE MIssouIp LEsISum&. -It is only a short time sinoe we chronicled an emphatic knock-down in one of the Hlouses of the Missouri Legis. lature, which was foUowed by the drawing of a bowie kmfe. We have now a similar indident to relate. A few da a snce, just before the vote on the Bank BilL was taken, Mr Albin, of Gentry, in a personal explanation, made some barsh strictures on Mr. Singleton, of Andrew. The rest of the story is thus told in the Inquircers legislative report -
"Here Mr. Singleton, of Andrew,rose frem his seatand advanced to the side of hia desk, towards the left centre aisle; when he arrived at the front edge thereof, he with his rIght band grppled for his inkbottled a second clutch !ecured it. Drawing back- he threw it Iwithmnuch foroe at Air. Albin. The bottle, Lcattering its contents all slong itg route, struck the deskc of on. r.ACininfront ci huim, and beunced off; carrying withx it a bsndkerchief, just h glancing ow the face of Ir Danes, of Scott, whose seat is About in a line withi the seat of Mr. Alinm. Upon this, and quicker thin we can pen the ac Mr. Albin drew from his breat a seven-inch Colts revolver, which he pointed with unenring certainty, and which he held with a wonderful steadiness directly at M1r. Singleton. Gentle. mien surroundivg .eithe.- person rushed towards them, not, hmoweme, until Mi:. Siikleton had stoopedl down, in the attempt, as it wouldajppear, to raise a spittoon. Mr. Clover, of St. Louik, who happened to be near, caught the arma of M1r. .Albin, and at the cameAlme. with his left hand, forced the pistel up to the celing. By this time the Speaker ccllested iinxinelf, and orieied Ltbe two persons undter arrest.

The freight ship Violet, at Woolwich, has commenwed ehipping war storeg for China. The cargo is to consist of sbot, shell, guns, mortars, and the three newly constructed 3-pounder batteries, arranged for mountain service as well as for traversing the rioefields, where the nature of the ground woulId not admit of the passago of heavier pieces of ordnnce. The wheels are mado of the Indian peedook wood, which contains a sappy and poisonous ingredient, sufficient to preserve it from being destroyed by the numerous ants and other vermin in those countries The ammunition waggons and watercarts are formed so as to be con. verted into ambulance waggons for removing the wounded, and are supplied with movable stretchers on elastic springs. The other portions of the woodwork of these batteries are composed of teak and mahogany. They are on a perfectly new principle, nd have excited much admiration.
The Ordnance screw teamship Balaklava, Captain Pellatt, is discharging at Woolwich Arsenal 280 cases of musket balls and other war stores from Plymouth, Portsmouth, and the Tower.
Tho destruction of the old Dreadnought, in Woolwich Dockyard, is now complete, ;he lower timbers having been separated and hauled out of the dock on Saturday last. The copper bolts and other metal, together with the old woodwvork, will probably realize 4,0001.

The new wall extends as far as the limits of the artiUlery practising range in thePlumstead-marsh, and ontains five spacious and well arranged entrances, secnred by ornamental and substantial iron gates, each guarded by a police station. The order for the exclusion of strangers from the Arsenal is strictly observed.

THE COLLIER'S LIFE.-But, while there is a home
TEi COLBI'S LrFE.-But, while there is a home life thus tending to humanise the collier, it has in itself certain inevitable defects. At 18 or 19 he can earn what he will earn at 50. After he is married, sons, as they growup, wdi by their earnings add to his prosperity: as a question of money, therefore, it is as wise for him to marry at 19 as at 29. Very early marriages are, for this reason, commonthey are founded upon a rough sort of of calf-love, and form a tie that is maintained, on the whole, pleasantly between husband and wife, but is maintained by no very peculiar community of interest or feeling. The hnusband is in the pit aU day, and the utisfaction of his animal wants fills the main part of the time at home. This may in part explain why, among the colliers, there are very many to whom the marriage bond does not appear so sacred or so necossary asit ought to be. In too many cases, if a collierleaves his wife and goes upon a journey, it is not a Penelope who
tays behind. I speak only, of course, in al that is herO said, from my own observation in a single district. I have seen in that district nearly al the col. liers' rwives, and some few of their daughters, working indefatigablyin their respectivohouseholds,-famons helpers to the men, and, with the rarest exceptions kindly treated by them. I have seen very many acts of noble self-devotion or; the part of husband on bebalf of wife, or of wife on behalE of husband or of child; but I could not possibly avoid seeing that the ties of family were worn loosely, as well as com. fortably, by a largo part of the community, and that, in a most material respect, the morality of the district was PainfuRy low. I have seen rough men become as women for a child's sakle, and have very seldom seen or heard in the pitcountry of children that were beaten or ill-used; but I have seen not unfrequently nperfluous children, by a sort of indirect murder, vilfully left to alp into the grave, and I have seen gaps made in a household by bereavement, bitter in the first few days, filled up so speedily, and forotton, as grief, so completely, as they could not be if the home ties were realy strong. It is a sad sight to see in four or five adjoining houses the blinds down and shutters closed, becanse hnouse-fathers and sos have been brought home
ead from the pit- but, of the greater number of the m~ourners, the grief seems to be ever very eoon after the blinds are up. Doubtless familiaity witi sudden death breeds some part of this tem per, whic& n have other cauaes,-2)jfn4 ouesfoM Ird, er

New Model Reformatory At Aberdeen.-
N1EvW MoDnx RExorixATOnY A, ABERD2E
About 20 years ago a benevolent physican in the city of Absrdeen, Dr. Watt, gave a donation of 1,000L forth. establishment of a house of refuge for the destitute, annC subsequently bequeathed an estate of 80 acres of lnd, near the town, for the purpose of supporting a reformatory foejuvenile offenders. The rental having accumulated to -a sum sufficient for the erection of suitable building ka donations having been received towards the support of a new reformatory, the building was erected, and openedo= Wednesday,in theterms of theleformatory ActforScotland The estate was left by Dr. Watt under the express condition that "not one shilling should be laid out in ornamen:V'and yet the building looks so comfortable in its plainnee - that the Government Inspector, the Rev. Sydney Tarner
could scarcely, be said, get the impression out of his mldr that it was too fine for the purpose. At the opening of tio institution there were present a number of theleaduig citizens of Aberdeen, directors of the House of Refuge, under whom, as trustees, it is placed; Mr. Thomson, ef Banchory, in the chair. He stated that he believed there was no reformatory institution in the kingdom so unique in its character as this one was to be, for there they would combine all that had been proved to be of the highest practical value in the experienoe of other reformatories in their system of education and industrial training. Situate as it was at a convenient distance from the city, the civil magistrate could sentence the youth who mightbe brought before him on criminal charges to be educated and trained there instead of ia the prison, while the benevolent feelings of the community would have ample scoe an iding to, sustain an institution which would in part be provided for at the pubHi expense. The reformatory will only be occupied by a limited number at first, and one of tho rules pro. vides that the directors shaU see that the youths who mabe trained in it are put to suitable trades. lr. Alexander Anderson, advocate and principal justioe, who has from the first been most assiduous m promoting the object of the testator, could not but congratulate the worthy secretary, Mr. John Watt, advocate, on the successful issue of his earnest; and enlightened efforts to get the reformatory established. He moved a vote of thanks to Mr. Watt, which was very cordially passed. The party were served with refreshments, after which they examined the accommodation, and expressed themselves much pleased with the place.
CRAULTmES ON BOARD AURicAcN SiPS.-W. must at last believe that there are tyrants on the sea as wf as tyrants on the shore,-tyrants on the quarterdeck of om packet-ships, whose awful inhumanity outshames ever
thing in the histories of the Spanish Inquisition, and whc. despotic eruelty has stripped our forecastles of every vestig of that manliness and nobility for which the sailor's pro. fession was once proverbiaL The stories recorded of th.
crimping and kidnapping which are prActised in New York to obtain crews for our Liverpool packet-ships, and of the tortures to which those crews are subjected by their officers: at sea, are-horrid enoughto make the coarsest heartshudder
and are such a disgraco to civilized nature as to appear incredible to any one who has not the evidence of their truth before him. Onr attention has been called to this matterby the Society of Friends of Foreigners in Distress at Liverpool, whose managing comrmittee has sent us a special re. port upon this subject recently adopted by the society. T is report states that hundreds of se"men are nnually turned ashore atLiverpeol in an utterly wretched condition, and ruined in health, from the treatment they have received on board the American ships in which theg sailed. During the past year the society personally examined the cases of 79 of these seamen, and in the month of January last the cases of 27 others. Of all these men only 37 had shipped for the voyage of their own acord ; the remaining 69 had all been kidnapped and carried to sea agaist their will. Some of these had left parents, wives and children in this country; and all of them, sAve two; complained that they had been repeatedly and grossly assaulted and tortured during the voyage. The fact that 82 of them had to be sent to the hospital, or to receive other medical attendance on their arrival at Liverpool, corroborates the story of their sufferings. But the cruelties practised upon these seamen on board their ships woclM* be incredible had the facts not been confirmed byproceedings in the Liverpool polie-court. In spiteof the romantic aspiration "for a life on the oean wave, and a home on therollng deep," whichdelicate young Madims and gentlemen are wont, of a summer's evening, to e- tt
the breakers ab Nahant or Newport, the proverb *tands. true, that a sailor's lifo is a dog's life. Yet facts lead us tobelievo that a dog's life Is every way preferable to a lif, in the forecastle of many of our European packet-ships, Th& report of this Liverpool Society, and the records of thbe
United States Comm oner's Court in this city, show that. humanity is the exception and inhumanity the rule of discipline in most of these ships. Sailors have been beaten~ by brutal mates until they are maimed for life; they have been set upon by bulldogs; have been stunned byalunn. shot; have been degraded persecuted, racked, tort=red and compelled to jnmp into the sato escape Sa violent anui horrible death from the brutal hollies of the deck t- All th^
has occurred on board ships owned by the Christian eitizens of New York I-lVcao York -Tmnsc
TH CE2rBAr Asi=wAx TREArY.-The treatyr respecting Central America recently negotiated in Londorm by Mr. Dallas with Lord Clarendon was rtified by the Senate on Thursday by the close vote of 32 to 15 (one b2orethan the two-thirds required). Our correspondent states that all bat one of the Republieans present voted to ratifSome amendments were nroposed, but thV do not seem tobe material, and, wetik hey wil beT My asseted Jso, by the Bntish Winistry. It is poaible obut we thinkhardly probable, that Lord Napier is alreay empowered to
asent to them. This treaty is open to grave objeetionseo' principle, in that it seems to bind our country with Greabt Britn in a complicate& partnership for the regulation aitd management of Central American skims We could bhadlhave counselled its negotiation, but, being negotlated,;wV could not advise its rejection. - The fact that it id moet dis
tasteful to&the Filibusters, and regarded by thed as an imn'pediment to the realization of their dreiams, re¢oncile sa t o.
ts gravest anomalies. Messrs. Buchanan iand Cass did xils'
o t ke pround against it, but it wa s pretty welU under-, 1a fthat x"y desired its rejetion. The Senate, however, preferred to keep the peace of the country in its ewnXalsand rather thas intrust it to the wild blood of those impetuou$ I 9lDSii.s; so t_ e tjrct *S ratifAhd,-N02 Yor)'ilffine
