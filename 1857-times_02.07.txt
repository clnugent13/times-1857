Friday Evening.
The Englijsh funds opened this morning at the price to which they had declined subsequently to the official close last evening, and after remaining Without variation during the greater part of the day they left off with a tendency to improvement. Consols for money were firat quoted 92i to 93, and, lhe last transactions were at 93 to J for money, and 931 to I for the 5th of March. The improvenent in the afternoon was attributed to a belief that the Bank return would be comparativelir very favourable--the exportation of gold having been neutralized by the steady refiux of coin from those provincial banks throughout the united kingdom in which it was recently deemed necessary to make a strong provision against the possibility of an insane run like that recently witnessed in Ireland. Bank Stock left off at 216 to 218; Reduced, 93i to ; New Three per Cents., 93i to i India Stock, 218 to 220; Exchequer-bonds, 994 to J; India-bonds, 2s. discount to is. premium; and E1xhequer-bills, par to 3s. premiium.
The settlement of the Consol account having been completed yesterday there was a diminished demand for money in the Stock-Exchange to-day; but scarcely any reduction was observable in the terms exacted, the rate for advances on Government securities stili ranging from 6 to 6& per cent. It has been estimated by some persons that the amount of speculative purchases carried forward yesterday to the next account, on the 5th of March, was between 3,000,0001. and 4,000,0001. As these purqhases offeotedt by borrowed moneya must uiltimately be closed by sales to a correspending extent, the prospect of the market seems discouraging. It miust be borne in mind, however, that although the feature in question is obviously an adverse one, the money at present employed in loans on stock must see~Nvestnent as soon as those loans are repaid. Probly a large proportion of the capitalists who are now. lending money on Consols are merely waiting a slight reduction in price to become permanent investers. To the degree in which this may be the cse the existing speculators will be relieved, and even if any large portion of the amount should be withheld from investment in stock it must then seek different securities, and cause an improvement in them, which will operate indirectly on the Consol-market.
Foreign securities were influenced in a slight degree by the various transactions. Sales of Turkish caused heaviness in that stock, and the Sixper Cents. for money were negotiated at 934, and for the account at 93' and ;s In the Four per Cents. Guaranteed the largains were for the account at 100g. The general business comprisedBrazilian Five per Cents., 1021 and i; Chilian Six per Cents, 105;; Danish Three per Cents., 84, 85, and 84 ; the Five por Cents., I04; Ecuador New Consolidated, 14t; Portuguese Three per Cents., for account, 44k; Russian Five per Cents., 109j and 109; the Four-and-a-Half per Ccuts., 96 and 97; Sardinian Five per Cents., 90 and ga ; Spanish New Deferred, 237 ; Passive, 5B; the Certiicates, 6a and A; Dtitch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 65k; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 98k. i, and J.
In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates generally were a shade firmer than last post.
The corn-market this morning was very dull, and there was a tendency to a further decline.
The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a moderate business and less firmness in prices.
The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 6Sf. for money, and 68f. 10c. for the end of the month, showinge a fractional impro;rement in consequence of money purchases.
The advices from the continent indicate a general tendency to a more favourable condition of the exchanges. At Hamburg the rate of discount has fallen to 4- per cent.
A further sum of 10,0001. in gold was taken from the Bank to-day for exportation.
Rumours have b-sen current during the last vweek or two that an attempt would be made at once to bring out the great Russian railway scheme. Accordig to some accounts this step wvould be necessary, in compliance with the conditions of the concession, but other statements represent that further delay has been granted. There is no doubt that but for the state of the money-market the affair would have been introduced last month. It is to be hoped that whenever it may make its appearance the public, notwithstanding all the efforts that will be resorted to to entice subscriptions, will recall the warninps that have been given.
The oUars brought by the last Mexican packet have been sold to-day at 602d. per ounce. This establishes a fall of 7d. per oumce, but the amount brought -was considerable, and the supply for the last two months had been unusually limited.
In the colonial produce markets during the week there has been some animation, the transactions generally being ulponl a rather large scale. Sugar has realized full prices, and 6d. advance, and considerable sales have taken place of Manilla, partly speculative, clayed bringing 51s., unclayed 44s. A very active demand has prevailed for coffee at further improved rates, particularly for coloury plantation. Native growth is firm at 57s. to U8s., beingaggain rather dearer. Rice has been steady, with a fair inquiry for common kinds. The principal feature in spice is a speculative inquiry for pepper at .d. to id. advance, both upon white and black. Saltpetre was very firm at the close of last and the commencement of the present week, several large contracts having beenmade in parcels to arrive at enhanced rates, but the market is again quiet, closing at aslight reaction for the better descriptions. Several parcels have come forward from the United States. Nitrate of soda is again a shade dearer and in good demand. The tea-market this week has been comparatively quiet, the late speculative operations having in a great measure subsided. Common congou is quoted is. id. to Is. Id., with buyers at the former price. At the public sale today 21,585packages were put up, and 3,200 sold. Green teas of fine quality realized extreme rates, but the lower descriptions, several of which were of old shipment, offered " without reserve," were unsaleable at former quotations.
At a meeting of the National Discount Company to-day, Mr. F. W. Russell, M.P., presiding, the dividend declared was 3s. per share, and the report and accounts were unanimously adopted. The chairman stated that the progress of business is satisfactory, but that, owing to a variety of circumstances, the results are not so great as might have been anticipated. The directors have paid strict attention to the interests of the shareholders, and consider that they have formed a connexion which will hereafter insure prosperity. The operations have been spread over a period of only seven months, during which the principle of limited liability has been introduced with success, although the board have had to encountercompetition and other adverse influences. The aulditors having made a full investigation, the whole of the assets are certified as being regular and correct, and the share and transfer department is stated to be faithfully conducted. A variety of questions were raised regarding the form of the accounts, the preliminary expenses and the remuneration to the directors, the whole of which were answered apparently to the satisfaction of the meeting. The rem-uLeration to the directors is fixed by the deed at 3,0001. a-year. Some nquihries into the details of transactions were re-
stes and impolitic; but share-
noazers WhO desire legitimate information are invited
to attend at the office. The site secured for the new premises in Cornhill, opposite the Royal Exchange, is considered advantageous; but the whole of the pecuniiary arrangements have not been finally adjusted.
At ahalf-yearly meeting of the Scottish Australian Investment Company held to day, Mr. W. SE.
Dickson in the chair, the dividend declared was at the rate of 8 per cent. per amnura, less income-tax, and the report, after a lengthened discussion, was adopted. The balance of profit and loss is 5,6071., -which added to the amount standing at the credit of the reserve fund makps a total of 3.1,8721. After the payment of the diVidend there will remain 4,8721. In the course of the proceedings complaints were made of the heavy expenditure in London and the colony, but it was stated that the directors endeavoured to exercise economy. With regard to the outlay in kustralia it is not thought possible to mako any altMtion, the services of the manager having been sought for in other directions at an increased salary. His experiments in connexion uh researches for coal have been unsatisfaetory,tbut
geAeallylis conduct has been approved. Proposals fer-.sale.or lease of the Boa Accord Mine (which
aa34jiaa the Burra Burra) have been under considera*on,~ < the opinion of the; m ajority gj X b ihre
holders is that a sale on adequate terms, with the reservation of a royalty, will be the preferable course.
At an adjouirned meetingof the ElectricTelegraph Company to-day the result of the ballot was in favour of the report of the directors, and a dividend at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum. The number of votes for the amendment was 1,757, and for the original motion 4,369, showiug a majority of 2,612. At the close of the proceedings a resolution was passed requesting Mr. Ricardo to resume his place in the direction.
The next males of colonial wool are appointed to commence on Thursdaythe 26th inst. According to a circular of Mr. W. I. Willans, the arrivals since the last sales have been about 25,306 bales, of which 15,686 are from the Cape of Good Hope, the remainder being from Australia.

LONDON AND SOUTH-WESTERN.
The report of the directors of the company states that the Ialance available for dividend forthepast half-year amounts to 238,5951., including 5,347& from the last aecount. The directors propose that a dividend for the half-year, payable on the 26th inst., hall be declared at the rate of 61. 10s. per cent. per annum., amounting, on 7,135,1421. of capital paid up, to 231,2134, and for the three months on 20,872. to 3391.; together 231,5521., leaving 7,0421. to be carried to tho next account. The rates of dividend for the last five years have been 3g per cent. for 1852, 43 per cent. for 1853, 4D percent. for 1854, 5 per cent. for 1855, and 6 per cent. for 1856. A comparativo8tatement of thetrafficshowsanincrease inthe mileage during the half-yearending the 31st of December last, of 135,363 miles; 27,564. in receipts from passengers, of 8,2761 receipts for goods, and 2,8591. for sundries, maxing the total increase in the receipts 38,6911. as com. pared with the corresponding period of 1855.

The increasing traffic, the arrangements made for working the Staines and Wokingham line by the company, the opening of the line from Dorchester to Weymouth, the intended opening of the Andover to Salisbury line, and of the Lymington line, which is to be worked by this company, render an augmentation of the rolling stock necessary. The directors have ordered new carriages and engines to be built to meet the requirement, and have carried to capital account, in the present half-year, the sum of 18,3494, already expended on account of the abovo augmentations. The Weyxnoioth br ach of the GreAt Western Railway was opened for traffio on the 20th of January last, and this companys trains have since that period been running througbout, between London and Weymouth, under the provisons of the acts relating to that pine.

Through rates have been established between this company and the Great Western Company at all tbeir points of juncton, with every facility for the transmission of traffic betoeen the most important towns connected with the districts of each of the two companies. The contract for the construction of the Exeter xtension Lino has been concluded on satisfactory terms,.and at an amount within the esEmate stated to the proprietors. Tho works havo been commenced, and the directors propose to borrow the money for their construction.

LEEDS, Fxn. 6.
WOOLLEN TRAD..-Daring the month of Januazy a. very large and satisfactory amonnt of business has been transacted, and the demand still continues good. In thebands of the manufacturers stocks are low. The *orlkpople in this district have been in good'employment, athe winter, and tbe presentstate or the cloth trade isonthe whole encouraginag.
WOOL.-Since our last report a steady business has been done in colonial wools, and the stocks, which were then moderate, are now very small. Prices, as might be ex-: pected from these circtumstances, are on the advance; East India and other low foreign wools are in tolerable demand at an advance on the previous sales, and prices firm. English wools of all descriptions have been extremely buoyant.
FLAx TRADZ.-GeneraUy speakingthe flax trade inILeeds . is in an active state, but stocks in the hands of the merchauts and spinners are low. An advance in price has been. established on all counts of linen and tow yarns. The high price of cotton has likewise an indirect influence on the fax trade, and tends to strengthen the spinners in maintaining the present rates. Some improvement has taken plac in the demand from the Barnsley linen manufacturers.
MACsUNR-.s%TAKr-xo.-Tho improvement noticed in our last report in this branch of trade still continues. A considerable drawback on the prefits of the machine-makers arises from the fact of the present high price of copper. which has again advanced ld. per lb. within a short time,. that metal entering largely into the constraction of flax mnachinery. _ _ _

SolcitoTs,
Messrs. Mlarten, Thomas. and Hollams. The following report was presented:-
The Directors have the pleasure of submitting to the shareholders a statement of the affairs of the Company on the 31st of December last, together with an abztract of the proeit and loes account. which shows a net profit of £7,766 14. 10d. after the payment of current expenses and providing for had and doubtful debts.
The Directors recommend that a dividend of 3s. per share on the original shares, wvith a proportionate divided of 3d. per share on the deposit upon tnow re, together amounting to X6,37656s 3d., be declared, and the balaneo, £1,390 9s. 7d. be carried forward to the next accomunt. It is suggested that the Uquidation of the preliminary expenses shall be spread over a series of years - no appropriation towarOs them is proposed,at this early period, but they have been held in view in the amoumtf o the balance to be carried over.
The directors have to express to the shareholders their satisfactiol with the progress of the business, the bills discomted to the 31st of December having amounted to ,926,413 Ifs. Id. and the number of accounts opened being 845. The results would have been stii rnore favourable but for the sudden advance inthe rate of interest inOztober and the great scarcity of money which has since prevailed. It mnust also be kep In mind that the growtb of every business is gradual and tbe fommmg a connexion a work of time, while the expeseas of an efficient establishment are Immediate, yet indispensable. The capabities of the offico have been necessarily adapted to transactUons of a much greater extent, but as the business increases the expenses will each year become a oDmparatively lighter burden on thb oits.
Besides the difflculties incident to every new und=king the directors have had to encouLter those peculiar to and consequent upon this company being the first formed for carrying on large monetary operations under the Limited Liability Act; but they believe an opinion is gaining ground-which an examination of the list of shareholders is well calclated to strengthen-that the new Jaw of limited hability, by attracting a superior claes of Proprietors and through the medium of a large subscribed capital, will afford tothcl publi a dgreea of security which recent events have shown not to bave bten always imnured by the old law.
The directors are glad tohave the opportunity of confirming the high oDinion they have already expressed of the abilty and knowledge of the managers, and of bearing teotimony to the efficiency of the secretary and the other of0iiers.
The officesat present occupied by the company, tbough sufficient]
central, aro most inconvenient, and the accems to them hs been much complained of; but the directors are happy in being able to announco that, after svcral protracted and Ineffectual negotiatons, they have at length zecured a most eligible sits in Cornbill on which they propose to erect a building which will afford suitasbe accommodation for the butiners of the comparny.
The directorswho retireaon this occasion, in conrformity with the terms of the deedi of' eEttlemeCnPt arne- PR. Andre,Esq., _ U. Ellis, Faq, F W.Itasel, Eq. M.., udi 31 Thmso, Esq., who, belrg eligEible, offer themselves for rce-eection.
he directors, in conclusion, trust they may be permitted to remind the shareholders that the further success of the company may be very much promoted by their individual exertions.

Lord CAMPBELL rose to move for tho production of a very valuable paper, which he though ought to be in the possession of a1 their lordshipg. Pour years ago a commission was appointed, over which helhad tho honour to preside, to consider the law of divorce, and this commission made a report, npon which was founded a eive t hah been twice laid upon the table of this house. It had, hownver, been thought-wisely thought, as hebelieved-that itwould be well to extend the measures recommended by the com-
ssion, andBheabillhof his nobleaidlearned friend would therefore, hd understood, be more conmprehesive than that .which the commissioners proposed, and would take into consideration the rights of married women eoparated from their husbands, with the various rights and ivabilities arising fronthewrelationof husbandand wife. The secretary o the commission, Cr. eacqueen, armed with valuable introdluctions furnished to him by his noble and learned f riend (Lord Brougham), had lately been in France, and from or al c ommubniatious, as well as from written hooks to which he had referred He, hea hadrepared a most valuable communicatien. ("Hear, hear, from lord Brougham.) This paper, which Mr. Macqueen had laid before the commission, gave a sketch of the laws relating to divorce, and to husband and wife, which prevaied in France uder the ancient rdhime, under the Code Napoleo7, duing the restoration of the Bourbon, and under Louis Philippe, as wel as under the presentlaw. He had alsogivenon abetracto' the codes of other continental nations particularly of the Austrid n and PtUBsian codes, which iast was especially interesting to them as Protestants who did not look upon marriage as mdissoluble It was of great importance that thir lordships should ail have an opportfuity of reading this valuable paper before the bill of hiB noble and learned friend came ore h em and he should therefore move that a humble address be p resented to Her Majesty praying, that a copy should be laid upon the table and shouldl he printed and circulated for the use of the members of this House.
Lord BROUsGHAM agreed with his noble and learned friend as to the value of the document aluded hi, and the propretyh d high e pediency oE having it in their possession before any discussion arose upon the intended measure. It was impossible to over-estimate the i n- portance of the information contained it it. On the general subject of marriage and divorce be might remark that his opinions remained precisely the same as they were on the last occasion when this matter was brought before the House, with this difference-that fhurther reflection and experience had onlystrengthened his conviction of the evil consequences of the present law.
The motion was r tn agreed to.
HARBOUJRS OF RELFUGE.
Lord RAVENShORTH gave noticecthat onlTharsday next he shopld call attention to the necessity which exi7ted for the formation of a harbour of refuge on the north-east coast.
CHUJRCH DISCIPLINE.
Lord BROUGHas asked his noble and learned friend on the woolsack whethethehe bill which he contemplated introducig into this house with respect to ecclesiastical discipline would contain any prov,sion for that which he had so frequently urged upon their lordships' attentionviz., a provision for giving to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, as a court of appeal, the opportenity of gettng access to the opinions of the episcopal bench, or a portion of that bench, upon questions of dochine incidentally, but most importantly, coming before them. He did not mean to say that the Judicial Committee was to be bound br the answers they receied from the ecclesiastical authoritis, but that they should have the benefit of the opinions submitted to them in the same manner as the Court of Chancery used to take the opinions of courts of la w, though not bound by those opinions
The LORD CHANCELLOR said that such a provision would he found in the bill which he should bring before their lordhips. lHis most rev, friend (the Archbishop of Canterbu u had been kind enough to communicate to him, in conjuncson with a groat many of his right rov, friends, a sketch of a bill for the amendment of the present law relating to church discipline. That bill contained a provision to the effect indicated by his noble and learned friend, but he (the Lord Chancellor) thought it very inconvenient and cumbroui. The course he proeedwaseaythat suggested by hisenoble and learned friend-namely, that some of the episcopail bench should attend the Judicial Committee asnasessors when their presencewould blkelyutoethrow lght upon any case brought before that body,

The Earl of CLANCARTY gave notice that on Monday he should ask whether it was the intention of the Government to introduce a measure in the course of the preSent session for the regulatLon of fairs and markets in treland, and at whast time it would ho introduced.
Their lordships adjourned at a quarter past 6 o'clock.

THE QUEEN'S ANSWER TO THE ADDRESS.
Lord ERNEST BRUCE, Vice-Chamberlain of Her Majesty's Household, appearedatthe bar vwith Her Majesty's reply to the Address. Hl e said-I have had the honour of waiting upon the Queen 'with the Address of this House, wvhich Her Majesty was pleased to recev in the most graciousmanner, andi to returnthe following answer -
"I have received with much satisfaction your loyal and dutiful address.
" I shall. gladly avail myself of your assistance in my endeavours to advance the best interests of the country, and to promote the prosperity and happiness of my people."
THE SITTINIGS OF CONVOCATION.
Mr. J. G. PHILLIMORE asked whether it was in. tended to allow the Convocation for the Province of Canter. bury to tit for any longer time.
Sir G. GREY said that the noble lord at the head of the Government, being unable to attend, had requested him to answer the question of the hon. and learned member. The House was aware that Convocation met in consequence of a summons from the Crown, and it was also, no doubt, awaro that Convocation had no power to make canons or make changes without an express license from the Crown, therefore any such proceeding which might occur this year, being without the license of the Crown, woAld be, he apprehended, invalid. The usual course was for the Archbishop of Canterbury to prorogue the Convocation a few days after its irst meeting. There was no reason to suppose that the Archbishop of Canterbury would not pursue that course upon the present occasion, but should he not do so, it *ould becoiie the duty of the advisers of the Crown to interpose, as it was inexpedient that the sittings of Convocation should be prolonged merely for the sake 'of discussion. (Hear.)
UNIF0ORM WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.
Mr. LLOYD DAVIES inquired whether it was the intention of Government to introduce a bill; and, if so, when, making it compulsory that weights and measures through. out England and Wales should be uniform, the loss from the inequality in the sale of corn alone being very great
.Sir G. GREY said the general act which was lat passed upon this subject was directly aimed at the object sought by the hon. gentleman. The machinery of that act was the county justices and local inspectors, and, although it had been certainly inefficientJy enforeed, that was the consequence of the absence . of proper ineasues to Wry ouxt the
-law. Ta,O he overnment&di not intend to propose any altsra-
tion in the law.
- OUNTY AND BOROUGH POLICE.
Colonel BUOk asked whether it was the intention of Govearmentto introduce a bill rendering it compulsory u,con! borougto amalgamate the police forces with those of the oountiesinrhich they are xituated.
. Sir G. GRBE repUed in the negative.
-UNIVERSITY OF ABERDEEN.
Mr. Li&YARD'ZAid, in the absonce of tho noble lord at the bhead of the Government, which he regretted to find was caused by indispo ition, he should postpone putting the question repecting Feruk Khan of which he had given notice until Monday, when he hoped some member of the Government would be prepared to give him an answer, as it
wasm;cortant before entering into a treaty with Persia that the country should be made acquainted with all the circumstances. He wreuAl take the prevent opportunity of asking whetheaf any nieasure had beenpnrepared for thc union oE the colleges of Aberdeen.
The LORD ADVOCATE was understood to say that difficulties had interposed, and he was not prepared at present to introduce any measure.
THE PERSIAN WAR.
Mr. H. BAILLIE inquired of the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether any agreement had been entered into with the dian Government respecting theexpenses of the Persian war, and whether any or what portion of those ex-
nS iS to be paid out of the revenueof Idia, also whether HerMajesty IEminters have admitted the claim of the Indian Government for the expenses of the last Chinese war, what the amount of the debt is, and why it has remained for so long a period andischarged.
The CHANCELLOR of the *EXCHEQUER.-The arrangement which has been made by Her Majestys Government with the East India Company in respect to the expensesof the Persian war is this-that Her ?Jajesty's Government shall propose to this House to grant payment of one half of the extraordinary expenses of the Persian war out of the national Exchequer, and the remaining half of the expense is to be borne by the East India Company. This arrangement has received theApprobation of the Court of Directors. In answer to the second question of the hon. gentleman, I have to state that the payment of the expenses of the former Chinese war has been so long postponed in consequence of a difference that existed be-
tveen the Court of Directors and Her Majesty's Government in respect to the terms of that settlement. The Coart ef Directors had understood that Her Majesty's Governmient were to pay the entire expenses of that war, while the Government, on the other hand, considered that they were only bound to defray the extraordinary expenses. The matter remained unsettled until last year, when it was brought to a conclusion upoa the prindiple that the extra. ordinary expenses of tnat war should be defrayed by the ImperiatGovernment, those extrdordinary expenses being understood to include ever7thing beyond the ordinary expenses which the East India Company would have had to bear for the maintenance of their fleet and army. The result of that settlement is that a sum of 590,693. is due from the Government to the East India Company, but, at the same time, Imay inform the House that the East India Comy owres to the Government a larger sum than lOO,wOO. (a laugh), and therefore no money will have to be
aid out of the Exchequer this year on account of the last
nese war.
IRISH TURNPIKE TRUSTS.
llr. BOWYER inquired whether Her Majestys Government intended to introduce in the present session a bill regarding turnpike trusts in Ireland.
Mr. HORSHAN repiled that a bill upon the sabject was in preparation.
CIVIL SERVICE SUPERANNUATION FUND.
Mr. COCHRANE Inquired of the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he thought that the commission on the Superannuation Fund would report to the Eouse; and vhether it was the intention of the Government to introduce this sesion any bill affecting the snperannuations.
, The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said it was not the intentioh of the Government to introduce any bill resp.eting superamNuations in the civil service until the cohemission appointed toh iquremento that subject had made
Ther repor. e had every reason to beleve that that report was linely gsbemade at no distnt period, and he confdently hoped to be able to lay it on the table of the house before Easter. (Hear.)
S AVINGS-BANEB.
Mr. WILt INSON asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether it was his intention to propose any measure this sessioh for the imorovemuent of the system upon which savings banks are conducted.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said the
sub;ect of savings-banks bad been under his earnest considetaho du4g terecss,and he had prepared a measure, the qeffeady oftw wonld beto give thethe garantee of the Govern. ment to all savings-banks which could comply with certaSn condihons,-w.ich conditions apcredtohim to be very reasonable ones. (eoar,UhEar) He Eould be prepared to subnit the measure to the House as soon as he saw any
prostect of its receiving consideration; but he did not thinke Tauvisable to bring in bills which could not be discussed for some time, and which wSere only encumbrances npon

Sir HM.'WGILOUGHBY hoped suflicientf tme woundibe given for a full consideration of the detail of the measure.

Upon the motion of Mr. H.±ER it was a&reed that the Uouse at its rising do adjourn ntiS honday.
THE FINACIAL STATEMENT.
On the motion that the SfnAEncE leave the chair in order that the house might go into committee of supply,
Mr. M. GIBSON said he wished to take the opportunity of makng an w iqury of the Cancellor of the Exchequer. The noble lor4 (Palmerston) in addressing the House on Tuesday intim~ted the Importance of having this session a very early' financhal statement. It had been, he believed, the practie to defer the financial statement unti the principa votes had been taken in committee of sunply on the
rmy nd navy estimates. But as the estimates, ho believed, were prepared, and musthythe order of Parhiamentbe laid before the House within a week after the first commnittee of supply, he wvished to kcnowv whether there was any eason whywthe Chancellor of the Exchequer should no' give the House the general views of the Government upon the expenditure and income of the country forthe year commencing April next. He, for one, really felt that, being likely to be asked to give his vote on large questions of taxation, he should be far better able to form a just o,pinion as to hopw to give those votes if he were in nossesmon of the general viewis of the Government. (Hear:) But he did not mean to say that the postponement of the financial statement of jer fajesty's Ministers conld for a moment be considered sufflicient reason to prevent private members mking the House of Commons for their opinion on any particular tax. (Hear, hear.)
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said the earliest day, consistent with the forms of the House, on which the army and navy estimates could be p resented was Tuesday niext. On that day be believed his right hon. friend the First Lord of the Admiralty would lay on the table of the House the navy estimates. The army estimates were in a very forward state and woald be produced in the conrse of next week. Thos: two classes of estimates would .be presented without loss of time, and would speedily be in
he nands of members. (Hear, hear.) He should be ready on the earliest day, consistent with the course of public business and he convenience of the House, and having regard to precedent andusage which distinguished their proceedings, to lay before them the financial plans of the Governient; hut he felt a difficulty in fixing any day before the army and navy estimates were laid upon the table. He should be preparod on Monday or Tnesday, or, at all events, on one of tM=frst days of next week, to fix the day for the conisideration either of the estimates or of the financial statement.-
Sir H. WILLOUGHBY did not quite understand whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer would be prepared to make his statement before the army and navy estimates were passed, or whether he would wait until those estimates were passed.
-TheCOHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUEBRunderstood his rht hon. friend the member for Manchester to express a decided opinion that, it was desirable that the financial statement should be made before considering the army and navy estimateA. His answer was that bhe was unable to state the intentions of the Government with regard to priority in the consideration of those matters, but that he would on . Monday or Tuesday state the course whish the Government
intended to pursue with respect to submitting the financial
statement before the army and navy estimates, or in tho
THE SEIRCH FOR SIR J. FRANKLIN.
Mr. ROEBUCK put a questionas to the intentions of the Admiralty with repard to further prosecuting the search for Sir J. Franklin by and parties.
Sir C. WOOD confessed he was not prepared to answer the question.
Mr. ROEBUCK apologized for not having given sufficient notioe, and said he would repeat it some day next week.
THE TERMS OF THE ADDRES.
Lord J. RUSSELL said he wished to call attention to what appeared to him to be a departure from a usage
which had observed for some years past, to the great convenience of members. Itkad been the practice, in answer to the Queen's Speech, to put the Address in such general terms as not to commit the House to matters which might afterwards become the subject of discussion, especially as the House was not usually called upon to give an opinion without having received information on the subject. He concluded, without attending, as he ought to have done, to the words of the- Address agreed to on Tuesday, that a similar ourse had been pursued. He oncluded so the more because the- hon. mover of the Address had shown great judgment not only inthe topics which he discussed, but in those which he omitted. (Wear.) He heard the hon. gentleman say that with regard to the affairs of Italy Persia, and .China the House would probably suspend their opinion until the papers were laid efore' them; but be found on
looking at the Addess adopted by the Honse, tiheso words ,-;
" We assure your Majesty that we participate in tho expression of your regret that the onduct of the Persian over"ment heasled to hosEtities between your Mfajesty and he Shah of Persa, and that the Persian Government, in defiance of repeatedwarnings, and in violation of its engements, baa besieged and captured the important city of
It was perfectly natual for the Ministers of the Crown to say that. They had all tho papers before them. TIey were entitled to form their, udgaent when they adopted hostile ;p!rocedings, but he did not think it 'was righb to ask the
aouse of Commons-to affirmn that the conduct of the 1Peman Government had led to hostilities. (Hear, hear.) 'He wasnot aware that'the Shah of Persia had besieoged any
pos ons of 'England, or c atied any of Her Zlajestyi
ihips- and he did no, think the lloase was awvr of "r
peateA warnings" and "engagomentsJ' with regard to tho important city of Herat. AU that might be proved bythe papers; bat he submnitted that the.House ought not to be caled on to pronounce a very decided opinioh on a matter with rietpect to which the, had not any informa'cion. gHear, hear.) Ho only Wvished to gu.ard against the inference of hll being a patty to tha affirms alan, and to shtot tha he should form his judgment free and unbiassed upon thc zDapers vhich might hereafter be producel (Htear,
Sir G. GREY said it was not the intention of the Government to commit the House, by the forta in which the Address was drawn, to any opinion on foreign policy. Tke right hon. member for lanchester pointed out that one paragraph had the appearance of expressing an opinion,
with regard to the events in China, and the noble ford at the head of the Government, acceding to the suggestion of the right hon. memberfor Droitwich, at once substituted a mere expression of thanks. The Government would not for a moment take advantage of the terms used in the Address with regard to the Persian Government, andif those observations had been made when the Address was under consideration he felt sure the noble lord would have acceded to any suggestion whereby the hpsoibilityof committing the House to an opinion would have been avoided. (Hear.)
Mr. GLADSTONE thought the moral ivas that very great care ought to be talen in the preparation of these addresses. It was not consistent withthe patience or rather the impatience of the ITouse that the Address should bo heard either when read by the mover or when read from the chair. He had, among others, anxiously strained his powers of hearing to catch some words of tht Address, bat such was the general inattention that it was in vain. By peculiar vigilance the discovery of an error was mado by the right hon. gentleman near him (MIr. aL Gibson), and his noble friend (Lord J. Rnssell) bad now detected another error. Ic only showed that in a matter of such delicacy greater care in turning the paragraphs of the Address ought
tbetaken before the HTouse was called on to assent to it.
Mr. E. ELLICE said that even with regard to the cie of China the Address committed the House in a manner in which it could lhardly have been intended. Tnrning to the Address he found that not only did the House thank fTer Maesty for information but "we concur vwith;vonr Majesty in trusting that the Government of Pekin wll see thepropriety of affording the satisfaction demanded, and of faithfnty. fulfillhng its treaty engavements." The House at present had no possible means o? knowing wehat those demands were, and consequently thev had given an opinion ulpon a matter of which they hJanot the slightest offlcial knowvledge.
THE FINANCIAL STATEMEN.
Mr. W. WILLIAMS believed that a s'tron foolin existed that the Chancellor of tho Exchequer should make his financial statement before the Government attempted to carry their votes in supply. If he did net do so he hoped the right hon. gentleman (MIr. Disraeli) would persevere with lis motion.
Mr. DISRAELL-I can assure the hon. gentleman that it is my intention to proceed with my motion whatever may be the course pursued by the ChanceUor of the Exche uer. (Cheers) Ithink that the object of that motion h s ueen mLsunderstood, and that it will be seen to be quite independent of the course which Her Majestys Government may think proper to take. I observed that great agitation prevailed throughout the country in the autumn, in oon. sequence of a, grievance which was sustained under an act of Parliament. I examined into the circtmstances of those allegations, and it Dappexed to me that it was a griovance justy complained o All that I shall propose to do is to repeal the act of Parliament that entails this grievance. In the agitation of this question, however, as in aU agitations of this kind, very many dangerons opinions have been circulated with respect to the Principles of taxation with regard to this particular law, and I thought it more judicious, not only to remove the grievancoe but to assert those sound and just principles on which I tnought the tax ought to rest as long as it is per mitted to remain in existence. I thought that if I attempted to remove the grievance withont arresting attention to the principles of the tax, I should parsue a course which would be injurious to the public good, and should only half perform my duty. I shaU endeavour in the motion I shall make to wcomplish both these purposes. I am not aboet to bring forward any financial scheme myself, nor do I vant to stand in the wy of the financial scheme of Her Majestes Ministers. Ith that the House of Commons is acting in the discharge of its first and highest duty in redressing a great grievance which has been complained of, and in asserting and strengthening those principles of legislation which I t]ink it of advantage should be maintained. Whatever estimates, therefore, may be brought forward in this house, and whatever may be their nature and amount, ways and means wl, I doubt not, always be found in order to sustain the pubhc service of the country. (Cheers.)
Mr. CARDWELT.-I hope that the speech just delivered wi confSrm my right hon. friend the Chancollor of the Exchequer in the good resolution that he his announced, although more faintly than I could have wished, to give us the financial stktement at the earliest possible period. (Cries of "1Hear,h her" At th6 same timne I do not understand how itia possibe for the llouse togive an opion upon one part o a eat financial case sithout having heard the whole of that case. (Hear, hear.) The right hon. gentleman opposite would first begin by repealing that which he calls the war inoome-tax, and he wos,ld then pro. ceed to vote those estimates which the public servicc deniands. I should be glad to vote the remission of that portion of the income tax which the war imposed, and then t provide the necessary estimates, bnt we shal do that vwth moreo confidence and satisfaction when we know that, after providing for all the necessary expenditure, there will
a balance in the Exchequer at the end of the year, notwithstanding the remission of that tax, or else the House will find itself in this predicament. The Crown may have to come to Parliament and say, " You have repealed a portion of the taxes, and voted larger estimates than the public mony provides. - What course will the House then be coim-
pelled to take? You must either sanction a loan in the lirst year of peace, or levy thoso taxes on articles of large consumption which for years it has been the policy of this Houseto repeal. (Hear, hear.) By the other plan we may proceed with confidence, and I trustweshall be enabled to repeal the oar income-tax as soon as it is seen that the amount necessary for the independent requirements of the present year leaves the whole of that snm open to the representatives of the people. That knowledge we shall not satisfactorily possess unless'we are first placed in possession of all the views of the Crown with regard to the requirements of the year. Myr right hon. friend has correctly stated that it is the practice to adhere to precedent in these matters. There have been two remarkable precedents upon this point. TIn 145 Sir R. Peel, having then abalance in the Exchequer upon the income of the year larger than the whole produce of the income-tax, felt it his duty to ask for a radustment of the am n a estimates, and follorwed up that readjustmient bhya renewal of the incometax. The course he adopted was not to take a voto upon the estimates, but he came fozward as early as the 14th of february, and in a committee of the whole House stated the wholeyviews of the Government, and concludedby asking the opinion of the House on the renewal of the income-tax. In 1848 the noble lord the member for the city of London had to propose another readjustment of the army and navy estimates. Unless I1 am mistaken, the course then pursued was to make the financial statement as the earliest step in the financial history of that year. We have now not to impose taxes, but to remit taxes and diminish estimates. And I submit that the proper course is that we, now reajusting the estimates and the taxation, should folow the precedents of 1845 anda184, and lea-rn from the Crown wvhat its opinion
is upon th e sum ne c pessary fo rthe mn g year, and that we

apprehended the meaning of his right hon. friend. Theyoai concurred in cAalig upon the Chancellor of the Exchequer to mnake his financia statement at the earliest possible period of the year. But the rlht hon. gentleman appeared to suppose that his right hon. friendl (M. Disraeli) was about to ask the House to takeintoits cond ierration themode in which the wayseand meanswere to beraised. But that was amiscoznception. A mistake had been made in an act of Parliament of 'which the people of Englandcomplained;.for, while under that act it was intended that the war income-tax should be levied for a year after the teraination of the 'war, b were
wording of the act of Parliament it seemed about to be levied for two years. He (Mr. Mralins) had pointed out the mistake last year (ear), and had asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer whther the Governmuent inteaded to avail tbhemselves of it, and to levy this mo st burdensome tax up to April, 1-855. Hoe ~eipcted that the Chancellor of the Exebeqiuer would havesad then, what the Governmtut *buld
Teoblged of say now, that they did not intend to avail themnselves o that aceideat. He believed that tho Parliamnent and the people of Eiigand 'had made u lp their minds on this subj'ect (cheers), and that, although it might be necessary to double the inoome-ta,r, yet that it couldL not be done under the existing act of Parliament. Ho desired to keephismindfre asto te wys nd eans, believing as he id ha, 'hatve th neesityofthe country mnight be,te manawnldo fond omeethoexpenditure. (Hear.)

certaiy bound to forego the advantage they had gained by the accidental wordingof the act, and to throw themselves upon the generosity of Parliament and of the nation.
The motion was then agreed to, and the Hlouse went into Committee of Supply.
Th CHAIRMAN (Mr. Fitzroy) having read tho paragraph in the Speech from the Throne relating to the estimates,
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER moved that "a supply be granted to Her Majesty," The resolution was agreed to. The Houso resumed,
THE BANK OHARTER.
The CHANOELLOR of the EXCHEQUER-I rise to make the motion of which I have given notiie for the appointment of a select committee to inquire into the opera. tion of the Bank Act of 1844, and of the Bank Acts for Ire. land and Scotland of 1845; and also to inquire into the lawv relating to joint-stock banks. In order to understand the operation of the act of 1814 it is necessary to go back to the time of bank restriction, and to consider the policy of the act proposed by Sir Rs Peel in 1819. By that act the value of the currency was restored after a long period of suspension of cash payments during the French war, and th car. rency was fixed upon a finn and legitimate basis. The principle established by that act was the convertibility, of bank notes for gold at a certain fixed value, and I trust that the time 'will never come when that principle will be caled in question by this House or by tho country. (Hear, -hear.) The*, question has sonietimes -been
scked -what is the meaning of A pDnnd-note ? and it he - - hen thouzht that zome difflculty exists in finding an answer to thaf question. But it appears to me, with great defercnee to the various able and acmplithed persons wbo-baYe, discuesed the matter, that no interrogator admitting of-& more simple and satisfactory answer ever wasr asked. Wliai
is the neaning of a pound-note? It is simply a promise to pay on deiadto the bearer, at tbe place rwhero the noteis i'ssued, thesiun of ono soverein. No mystery is involvef in the answrer to that plain question. A bank note is a proinise to pay a detinite sum in coined money of a Icnown weight and value, and if that promise is not fufilled a tolltract is broken and a fraud is committed. I thinl, therefore, it cannot be denied with truth that the convertibility of a banknoto is a plain question of contract, that it rests upon principles of honesty which must be recognized not only by every speculator, not only by every political economist, but by every man of plain senso and understanding (hear, hear); and I cannot believe that the time will ever come when any !rge, when even any small portion of this House, or when any considerable portion of the peoplo of this country wiU contest the validity of those principles. I can conceive that a Government may overcome a temporary do. fciency by issuing for a time inconvertible paper, by discharging its engagementsin promises to pay,which promises it does not fulfil, but I confess I am at a loss to understand the opinions of those persons who believe that the wealth of a country can be increased, and that tho trade of a country resting, as it does, upon credit, can be benefited by the increase of mere promises to pay, which promises the issner is not bound to fulfiL I trust, therefore, that the principle upon which the act of 1819 is founded, of the convertibility of paper for gold, wiU never be seriously contesed by any party or person in this house. But in the course of time it was found that the act of 1819,. although it established this important principle, did not in all cases provide effectual securities for its enforcement. Excessive issues of paper were made from time to time by country banks, and although notes were always convertible by law it happened in many cases, upon the failure of akuntry banks, that they were not convertible in fact. I'clitof the Bank of England was never in truth impeached, but it was contended, that its issues were sometimes exoessive, that its reserves of bullion. wre not always suffilciently great to support pubolic confidence, and accordinglySirp. Peel, acting under the advice of a committee presided over by my right hon. friend the First Lord of the Admiralty, proposed in 1844 the act which I am about to ask the House to refer to a select committee. Tho policy which Sir R. Peel announced that he intended to enforce by thbat act was not merely the convertibility of banknotes and the legal liability of their issuers to pay them, but also, by imposing certain conditions as to their issue, the provision of effectual securities against their depreciation. Now, I freely admit that, in proposing the restrictions embodied in the act of 1844, Sir R. Peel sought to establish a principle upon which the presumption lay against him. He attempted to impose restrictions upon the bankdng trade, and I quite concur with those persons who hold that any one who seeks to impose limits and restrictions upon the banking trade comes forward with a presumption sgainst his policy, and is bound to establish a strong ease of expediency or necessity. In my opinion Sir P. Peel did ostablish a strong case. His view, I apprehend, was this, when a bank such as the Bank of England is empowered by the Legislature to issue notes, when those notes circulate freely from hand to hand, when they are invested by Act of Parliament with the attribute of being a legal tender, when the Legislature, in fact, confers upon the bank the power of issuing paper which, whatever theorists may say, practically discharges the functions of money, the Legislature is just ified in imposing certain conditions upon the exercise of that power. That was the principle by which Sir R. Peel justified the restrictions ho imposed by the act of 1844. A subtle discussion hasibeen raised on the question of what is moneywhether bills of exchange and commercial instruments of that nature are to be considered money-whether the term should be confined t o paper instruments such as banknotes, and whether even the title of money should bo refused t, banknotes, being legal tender. It would be quite out of place for me in a practical assembly such as the House of Commons to occupy time upon the discussion of such questions; and, I trust, the House in debating this subject will not think it necessary to go into questions of the theory of currency, with respect to which I need ssarcely inform hon. membe rs a very lage collection of volumes exists. But I may be permitted to say that it seems to me a practical queation whether or no a banknote does not deserve the name of money. If a banknoto enables a person, who is unknown, to offer wherever he goes in the country a legal tender without reference to his individual creditor character, it appears to me that such an instrument deserves the name of money, ana practically dis charges the same functions as sovereigns. If that b3 tho character of the banknotes issued by the Bank of England, a justification arises for the Legislature to impose such restrictions as the public advantage may demand on the extent to which such banknotes may be issued. Sir R. Peel, by the act of 1844, for tho first time placed on the discretion of the Bank of England certain limits with respect to the issue of banknotes. The Bank was by that act restricted to the issue of 14,000,0001., represented by securities, and so much more as might be equal to the quantity of bullion in possession of the Bank. Beyond these limits the Bank of England under the present act is not entitled to go, with the exception of a small addition which I shall afterwards mention. The policy of the act of 1844 was, therefore, in general to impose such restrictions on the discretion of the Bank of England as would practicaUy secure its maintaining such a reserve of bullion as should. at All times be equal to the demands of the public for the conversion of its notes into gold. I think a fairer test cannot be taken of the practical success of that act than by comparing the quantity of gold held in reserve by the Bank of England for 10 years prior to 1844, and for 10 years sobsequent to that Act. If the House should find that there has been a great increase in the average quantity of gold held by the Bank of England in reserve since 1844-if the House should find that the mW.emum, quantity and the mintmuns quantity and the averages also have been greater, the conclusion must naturally be arrived at that that act had accomplished the object for which it was designed. (Hear, hear.) The contrast is so decided and immediate on the change of legisla. tion that it could not be attributed in any considerable degree to an increased supply of the precious metals, and of gold principally, in late years. It was quite conceivable that, though the supply of gold increased, the Bank might not have thought it necessary to keep a larger reserve unless the legislative restriction, to which I have already alluded, hadbeen in operation. I hold in my hand a statement of the highest, lowest, and average amount of bullion in the Bank of England, from the year 1834 to the present time, and I will read to the House some of the principal results. In 1843, the average amount was 11,700,0001. in round figures, being the highest amount during the 10 years prior to the act of 1844. The average amounts for the other years were, in 1834, 8,000,0001. (omitting all the figures after the millions); in 1835, 6,000,0001.; in 1836, 6,000,0001.; in 1837, 5,000,0001.; in 1838, 9,000,0001.; in 1839 and 1840, 4,000,000D; in 1842, 8,000,0001.; and 1843, 11,000,001. Well, in the first year after passing the act to which I have referred' the average amount of the bullion in the Bank of England was 15,000,0001., and in 1855 it was 14,000,0001, In 1847, which was the year in which the average was lowest, the average amount was 10,600,0001, and the mini,
rntis amount was never under 8,00,0001. After that year the average amount rose to 14,00Q,00., 16,000,000W., and in 1852 to 20,000,0001. In 1853 it was 17,000,0001., and in 1854 14,000,0001. Sinco 1843 the lowest average was 10,600,0001., and the highest 20,500,000D., whereas before 1843 the highest average was 11,700,0001., and consequently the lowest average since 1843 did not very much differ from the highest average before. These figures could not fail to oonvince the House that, assuAming that the act of 1844wa to increase the average reserve of bullion in the Bank of Englan d, that object had been very completely attained. There is another part of that act to which I must
advert briefly-a separation of the issue and bank. ing departments was then effected. That separ.
tion was an essential part of tho act of 1844, and was then introduced for the first time. The effect of that separation is, that the accounts of those two departments ar kept separately, and that for practical purposes, whiI the management of the Bank proceeds in its ordinary manner, these two departments are managed independently of each other. With respect, however, to the legal effect of the act of 18, I may as well in passing state,-though it is not certainly a practical question,-that, in the event of the insolvency of the Bank of 1ngland,-a contingency not pery likely to occur,-it is held by those most competent to form an opinion on the subject, that all the creditors, both tote holders and depositors, would have equal rights and equal claims on the general assets of the Bank. In such a contingency the funds of the Bank would. be considered Ls one, though, for the practical management of the Bank, and for the purpose of measuring its isues which was the object the framers of the act had in view, the separation of the two departments was made. I now come to the effects *f this act as developed in successive years since its passing; aud, first, I will venture to call the attention of the House to what occured in 1847. In that year the operation of this act underwent an important trial. Commercial distress of a very aggrAvAted kind was then experienced; and the Bank of England was subjected to a heavy pressure for the
urpose of incucing it to extend its advances and disqounts. .Che Bank found itself restrained by the limitations of the act of 1844, and applied to the Government on tho subject. The noble lord, the member f London, was
then at the head of the Governinent, Liid the pre-
sent First Lord of the Admiralty filled the iitlkation
which I have the honour to occupy now; and after muchdeiberation.tey. issued aletter authorizing thq Bank.-9f Egladto in ciase its advan ces upon. approved secifities,
and assgOin tafo directors that if that co8sre Ted toan {n. fringepxent cf-the Ilaw the Government would applyto'Par. Ji5Shedt for an-riuidemnity. However, the provisioPs of. the
act'swere mever lnfringed, the Bank of England niever- being' calltd.on to extend its issues beyond the limits settled by the act of 184, and the Govermnment were never necessatatedl, C nSequesnt1Y. to apply to Parliament for a bill of indemnity. Nevertheless, on the meeting of Parlianment a committee of inquiry into the matter was proposed, and the Sub ect tundetwent a full discuasion in this house for several aights. A committee, composed of some of the ablest members, sat and examained witnesses, and came to a report to whic I will refer. The commnittee reported as follows:-
"Your committee have had under their c-onsiderationL w'hether it'is advisble that powers should be conferred by law upon the Goverrnment to enable them to meet the oocurrenoe of any circumistances which may call for extraordinary7 inteorference ; but they have come to the conclusion that, looling to the impossibilit y of foreseeing what the precise character of the circumstances may be, and also what may be the measure best calculated to meet them, it is more expedient to leaive to those with whom the responsibility of the Government may rest at the time to adopt such measures as may appear to them best suited for the emergency. Your commnittee, therefore, after a careful review of all the evidence, arc of opinion that it is not expedienit to na'ke any alteration in the Bank Act of 1844."
A Committee wras also appointed by the other House of P'arliament which did not, I believe, recommend any alteration of the act'. The questiosa, at all events, was considered by the other House of Parliamnent, and the whole matter underwent their fiul iconsideration when those circumstances occurred. I have taken the liberty of recurring to these events for the purpose Of suggssting to the House that, inasmnuch. as the effects of the crisis of 1847 were very fully investigated at that tine, there seems no ocaion a present for the appointment of the committee which I am about to move to reinvestigate the circumstances of that period, or to do anything more than to consider the operation of the act at that time, as shown ina the reports of that period in estimaating its general Dolicy. The subject that will more justly engage the delaaded attention of the committee is the operation of the two ac ts of 1844 and 1847 up to the present time. During that Interval we have ha an arduous war, which has led to great exportations of bullon for foreign service. We have had a transition fromn war to pecace. 'We have also had to encounter changes in the qnotary system in senme of the continental countries, which Rtve substituted a gold for a silver currency. The failure of the silkecrop in China, Italy, and Prance this vear has led to a great increase in the importations ofsilklcfos the East, and has rendered necessary a great increase in the exportation of bullion. All these were disturbing causes of the first magnitude, and yet we have found that the currenicy of this country under the tutelary influence of the act of 1844 has remnaincd in a sound state, that theocredit of the Ba3nk has never for a moment been in question, and that it has not experienced any real or pressing difficulty in maintaining the large reserve of bullion which I have already statedI to the House. In estimating the effect of that act I trust that the House and the commaittee will bear in mnind that it has had no ordinary ditriculties to contend with (hear, hear); that this has not been what is called a no'rmal period ; that it has not been an ordinary state of peace, but that our currency has been exposed to severe trials, and that out of those trials it. has emerged triumnphant. (Hear, hear.) Now, Sir, having in view the renewal of the privileges of the Bank of England for another Deriod in the cours of the present session, and the expedienioy of either allowing the provisions of the act of 1844 to remain unchanged, or of introducing certain amendments in those p.-ovisions, in the course of the autumn I placed mayself in communication with the Governor of the Bank of England, in order that I might ascertain whether he or his colleagues were of opinion that any amendments should be made in the existing act. Being themselves practically acquainted day by day with the workiing of the act, and especialy of it-s restrictive prvisions, they cannot be considered as other than fair and cdmpetent judges of its operation. With the exception of, I think, not more thian one director, they have given their opinion that it is not expedient to snake any material alteration in the provisions of the act. I therefore, Sir, assumne that the principile established by that act-viz., the imposing of somelegislative limitupon the issue of the Bank of England, is taken as established. Those who contest the policy of the act admit in general termBsthat principle. Imay refer particularlytos gentleman of whonilI eak with very sincere respect, Yr. Tooke, the author o11?the well-knowu. beak on prices, which is a most valuable economiical history of this country. Well, Mr. Tooke izs a strong opponent of the act of 1844. He proposes, it is true, a principle of limiitation upon different data from those recogni2edh law, but still he is in favour of a restraint being
pt upon the discretion of the Bank. And I am unable to fund that there is any considerable number of practical persons engaged in banking or mercantile affairs, and acquainted with the operations of the act, who propose to dawywith all legislative limit, and to return simply and wihu ulification to the act of 1819. Well, then, if we assume tht that principle is granted , there are certain other points which are fairly open to consideration before the privile&es of the Bank of England are renewed for another period. It has been said that throuigh the indiscretioni of the Bank directors,. or in conse-luence of the operation of the act, there has been an inconvenient fluctuation in the rates of discount, and that that has been produced by circumstances which .legislation could have prevented. Now, Sir, I MUSt be permnitte.d to state my very confident opinion that the Bank Of England directors are nof, answerable for the inequalities in the rate of discour'. (hear, hear) ; that the rate of discount is regulated by causes over which they have little conitrol; and that in rais-n&and lowering of the rate -of discount the Bank directors fo ow and do not lead. They are not the regulators of the rate of discount in this town. 'The amounit of hills discounted by them is in the aggregate les than those discounted by private houses. They have it not in their power either to increase or diminish the rate of -discount. It is something which is governed by a cause whiclh is peculiar to itself. It does not vary according to the general rate of the interest of the country, as some persons suppose. If anybody will take the trouble to compare -the price of V)onsols with the Bank rate of interest he wvill findl that when Consols remain stationary, ,when the rate of money lent upon real securities remains quite stationary, the Bank rate of discount and the general rate of interest in this town mnay mndergo very considerable fluctuations. It is a mode of employing money which is liable to certain influences; it has a territory of its own whicll is governed by causes, I will not say iLdependent of, but to a great extent anconnected with, those which regulate the general rate of interest in this country. I have before me a very detailed account of the fluctuations in the Bank rate of discount. It is impossible for me te read the whole of it to the House, butlI will state what appears to me to be the general result, which is that when the Bank rate of discount is the highest the amount of bills under discountisforthemost partverylare; andwhen the Bank rate of discount is low the amountof bilisunderdis. -count at the Bank is for the miost part less considerable-a fact which shows that pressure is made upon the Ba.nk when its rate of discount ishigh, and that far less pressureismnade upon it when its rate of discount is low. The result seems to me -clearly to establish that the Bank is not the regulator of the rate of discount. If the greatest numaber of applications are made to it when its rate of discount is highest, it is clear that it is because thle general rate of discount is high, that persons desirous of having their bills discounted cannot get more favourable, or as favourable, terms ebsewbere, and therefore they crowd to the Bank of England. When the Bank of Enigland rate is low the rate elsewhere may nerhapsbe even soniewhat lower. That fast, Ithink,imust
econsidered as conclusively exonerating the Bank from the charge of having augimented commercial distress by by their indiscretion with respect to the management of -the rate of discount. It shows that, whatever faults the p r.esentac' t may have to bear, it cannot be justly blamed
or aiag created any unnecessary hardship with regard to the fluctu-ations of the rate of discount in those times.5
The Lext question which ought to engage the attention of the commiittee is that of the precise i it which should be flxcd upon the issue of notes on demnand. The limit was originally fixed at 14,000,0001..; but since that time an order of Cotuncil has been made, under a clause in the act, by which the Government is empowered to authorize the Bank to issue in adldition to the 14,000,0001. upon securities twothirds of the amount abandoned by the country bank-s. The additional sum which the Bank can issue in conse once of that order of December, 1855, is 475,0001. thereflore it is at present empowered to issue notes to the amnount of 14,475,000. It has been suggested that this limit is tco narrow, and that it might be increased or enlarged. Now, Sir, 'with regard to the point at whichi numerical limits are fixed, it is very difllcult to give an answer which shall be conclusively in favour of any precise amrount. (Hear, hear.) When it is once admitted that a limit is to be adopted it is necessary -to fix upon some sulm at which the line ashall he drawn, hutt it would be very difficult togvearsowhithulnt be alitle ore r alitle lesWntee case of a duty of Is., it would generallybe difficulttoshowwhyitshouldbo thatprecis0 amount, and not either Ild, or 1ld. In the present instance the ansiount of 14,(CCO,0C01. was taken as representing the lowest amnount to whichi it was thought the currency mlight descend, and I believe it has, in the operation of the act, been found not an iniconvenient amount. Those persons who desire to raise this limit to about 16,000,0001. have it, I a,pprehend, in view that such an alteration would enlarge the issue of the Bank and the paper currency of the country by the aniount of about 1,500,000. My belief is that an extension of the limtit to that extent would have no such
effect (hear, hear), but v,ould simply enablotheBankto keep a million and a-half less gold. The issues would not be increased, because they are already sufficient to meet the vrants of the trade of the country. In any measure which I now have in contemplation it is not my intention to propose any alteration of the limit which is now fixed by law and which may, in round numbers, be taken at 14,500,0001. At the saume time I quite admit that it is a subject fairly within the consideration of the cominittee- and I need not say that if I am appointed a member of that committee I shall be fully prepared to go into the inquiry with the view of seeing whether any public benefit would arise from the enlargement of the limi'. (Hear, hear.) There is another point which is referred to in the report of the committee of 1848, and which is generally mentioned in connexion with the policy of this act. I mean the question whether, as a legislative limit is to be imposed upon the discretion of the Bank with respect to the issue of paper, mower should not by law be vested in the Government to lispense with the restriction, and to enable the Bank in oxtraordinary circumstances to depart from the provisions of the act. I confess that T am entirely hostile to any such provisibn. (Hear, hear.) Itappearstomethatnotonly is the Movernment-empowered, but it is required by the maximn Snalts populi suptrema lex-by the duty incumbent upon all Governments to interfere at critical moments-to deport from the 5provislons of the law, and afterwards to come to Pariame4 for an indemnity-the course Ewhich was taken in the yekr 1847, In auppo rt of that opinion I will take the liberty of referring the Hlouse to a remarkable precedent in the year 1797 on the occasion of the Bank restrictio.n conseeuence of the demands which were made upon the Bank for foreign loans and for the military service of the year, the bullion in the. Bank wvas at the commencement ot the year 1797 reduced to a very low ebb. The demands upon the Bank increased; the reserve of bulion diminished di ng the month of February, until at the end of acst
week in that month it was found that matters had becte
tlgent; -Psrliament was tling-t thmu-time,bpt8 t.it
thougha the affair sopreesino-that, aftetcommunjcati,& with. the-Bank authorities onthelaturday, he convened a Gonneil oin the Sunday. On a certain Sunday in the month of February, 1797, an order in Council was agreed to restraining the ank from,aylig in specie; and on the following day, Monday, Mr. itt brought down a message from the Crown informingParliament of the step which had been taken, and explained it to the House. I think that precedent, the legality of which has never been questioned, although the Dolicy of the Bank restriction has beeft much disputed-an example set by Mr. Pitt, who was very careful of constitutional precedents-.must convinca the House that there does inhere in the executive Goveruiment a nower of meeting emergencies of this kind which they are called upon to exercise upon their responsibility, however painful that responsibility maybe; and It apyears to me that it will be better to leave the matter in that state than, by attempting to allow a discretion by the act itself, to confer upon the executive Government a dangerous power of at any time interfering 'with its operation. Therefore, although I fully admit that the subject is one which mnay very properly be inquired into and considered by this committee, it is not a provision which I should advisethemtorecommend. Tberefore,the course which Iam prepared to adopt is this, subject to any amendments of the law which the committee should suggest for consideration, within the limits which I bave sketched :-I shall, at the proper season, be prepared to introduce a bill renewing the privileges of the Bank of England for another period of 10 years. There are also questions as to the Bank of Ireland, and the operation of the act of 1845 in that country and in Scotland. The Bank of Ireland possesses no peculiarprivileges; all that it seeks is a renewal of its corporate character, together with the removal of a restriction imposed upon it by an act passed in the reign of George III., which seems to me quite unnecessary-viz., a prohibition againist the lending of money upon mortgage. The Bank of ~EDgland is empowered by law to advance money upon real securities, which power it exercises np to a certain limit. It is well known thab loans upon real securities are not in Xeneral prudent investments for a bank. The Bank of
not wish to exercise this power to any large amount. They seek relief from a restriction to which they are now subject, and the demand seems to me to be a reasonable one, provided that the amount which they should lend in such a manner should be limited by the act. Tith regard to the Scotch banks, I have communicated with the directors of the six principal joint-stock banks in Scotland, with the view of ascertainig vwhether they can suggest any alterations in the law. I have not received from them any material suggestions, and do not find that the operation of the act has been complained of. I have now called the attention of the House to what seem to me the most important questions involved in the act of 1844, and which will require consideration from the committee. It is of the utmost moment to the country that its currency should rest upon a sound basis. On the soundness of its currency the trade, the industry, and the credit of the nation depend; and no effort should be spared to maintain in their integrity such provisions of the law as secure so valuable a blessing, and so great a source of wealth and prosperity. But there are other questions connected with this subject which, although subordinate in their importance, yet deserve, and I hope will receive, the attentive consideration of the committee. I alude to the arranse. ments subsisting between the Bank of England, in its relation of a banker, and the Government-that is to say, with regard to the deposit of the public money in the custody of the Bank of England, and also with regard to the managoment of the national debt. The pecuniary relations subsisting between the Bank and the Government do not, like the subject of the currency, affect the interests and fortunes of trade and production. !Xevertheless, within their limited sphere they are of undoubted importance. Under the late act the Bank of England now pays about 188,0001. annuaUy to the Government for the privilege of issuing notes. I think 120,0001. is the sum fixed by the act, in addition to wbick the Bank pays 60,0001. a-year for stampduty, and anotber trifling item of 8,0001., making the total amount which it pays to the Government in connexion with the paper currency 188.0001. The profit derived by the Bank of England from the currency is calculated upon different principles, and itis perhapsnotveryeasyto decide its precise amount; but the highest estimate that I have heard places it at about 170,0001., and the lowest at about 80 0001 The Government, therefore, receives from the Bank a farger sum than that made by the Bank in the shape of profits. In addition to the contribution in respect of the issue of notes, the Bank also makes a payment for the management of the national debt. The scale of that payment is prescribed by s-ct of Par-liament. They pay at the rate of 45i01. per 1,0o0,0001. for every part of the national debt not exceeding 400,000,0001. 8 401. per 1,000,0001. for every portion between 400,000,000. and 000,00,0001.; and 3001. per 1,000;0001. for all above 000,000,000. This is the scale fixed by act of Parliament, but it will be open to the committee, ill connexion with the general question of renewing the charter, to revise the terms upon which the privileges of the Bank shall be continued. I may also state that I am now in communicationwith the Governor of the Bankof Eng. land on the subject of the pecuniary arrangements subsist ing between the Government and that corporation. Upon the result of that commur,ication it may depend whether or not the Governmnent wiU deem it advisable to propose any modification in the terms of the present arraugement. if such a modification should be thought expedient, and it is likely to receive the asent of the Bank, the Government will of course bring the matter under the consideration either ofthe House or of the committee. I have been compelled to trouble the House at, I fear, a wearisome length on this question; but the matter is one of so much n. portance to the whole community that I have preferred to appear to be unnecessarily tedious rather than to withhold anything which might be essential for the information of hon mermbers. Before I sit down I have only to add that the subject of joint-stock banks has, from circumstances well known to every hon. gentleman, attracted a great degree of public attention during the last twelve months or more Some of those establishments have failed in the most alarming manner, producing the most disastrous conse-
uences to their unfortunate shareholders. (Hear, hear.) it therefore appeared to me that the subject was one well worthy of investigation before a committee of this House, The procedure by which the affairs of insolvent joint-stock banks are wound up is anything but satisfactory. (Hear, hear. Sujggestions have been made-although I confe&s that I am not one of those who approve them-for the substitution of an inspection of the state of their affairs by a Government officer for the vigilance and control of their own directors. I, for one, greatly deprecate any attempt to improve the mainageuent of joint-stock banks, or any other merca,utile undertakings, by weakening the mrotives for due care and caution on the part of those directly interested in such ente rises by holding out the shadoivy safeguard-for, aftert a, it never can be any real protection-of Government controL However, this is one .f those matters which may fairly receive the attention of the co,mmittee. I freely admit that there is a great dissimilarity between the question of joint-stock banks and the all important subject of the currency, which wiU constitute the main topic for investigation by the committee. Still, it appeared to sue that it would be difficult to form two comuiittees, to sit both at the same time, on subjects as closely related to each other as the affairs of the Bank of England and the currency generally, and the law of jointstock banks. On the otherhband, I think it would not be expedient altogether to omit to consider the question of joint-stock banks, and J therefore propose that it be submitted to the same comnittee. Thep right hon, baronet (who had spoken throughout in a tone too low to be distinctly heard) then concluded by moving for the appointment of the committee.
Mr. DISRAELI (whose remarks were at times inaudible from the same cause) said,-If it be desirable that both of the subjects brought under our notice by the right hon. gentleman should undergo the investigation of a select committee, I think it would be very unwise that they should both go before one and the same committee. Between the currency and joint-stock banks I see no necessary connexion; and, moreover, the question of joint-stock banks has by itself attracted the greatest amount of public attention, and is likewise one of sufficient difficulty and importance to demand the undivided labours of a committee. (Hear.) But, after listening to the statement given by the right hon. gentleman of the intentions of the Government respecting the currency and their relations to the Bank, I am really at a loss to understand what are to be the duties of the proposed committee on that important subjept.

Of course, onasuch a, subject I shall not attempt to dividethe House should thore appearto bea predoinantfeeling infavour ofadoingthe proposed course, but I beg the House to consider whethe it, -woujld not be maore advistable, as I have suggested, that the committee on joint-stock banks should be confined to that topic, and that the renewal of the Bank Act should be brouight before us in the shape of a Governmnent bill, which could be discuissed in this house,
Mr. TITE, said that the speech of the Chancelor of the Exchequer.had confirmed the impression produced on his mind by the Rtoyal Speech, that the Governmaent were about to lay this question before the House with a foregone conclusion u,pon it. On no subject was there suxch in esdraordinary difference of opinion among men of the gretest ability 'and meast extensive informiation. The reportd of the select committees of the two Houses of -Parliamnent were comnpletely opposed to each other, though the report of the select committee of that House was carried by a smnall majority only,'and many meiabers of it agreed entirely with the report of the RTouge of -Lords' committee, that the panic of 1847 was materially aggravated by thieoPerationlOf the act of 1844.. Mlr. ToOkCe a Lso was of that opinion, and 'he was completely'oppiogeato the characteor and the arrangements of that act.

Buat what was the case witn regard to the notes of th"e public? At the beginning of October when the s began, to be severe, the notes of the public were not diminisahed by more than 200,00ix. from the amount st which they xtood in July, when ther was no preure. How, then, can it be sfid that the act of 1844 produced the crisis of 1847a Again, in the three mobsez ed, October, 1847o the amount of accommodation afforded tot epublicinthe shape of discouxt to private pero wasbetween c ,000,00W. and 7,0pr,0cu. The acthof 1844 could not therefore have produced the cris of 1847, eitr by dimini iing the amount df notea held by the public, or by diminishing the power of the Banrk of England to assist private trade. (Hear.) The Lon, member for Wick (Mr. Laing) said that the word "nemoney' was used in two sens and half the discuions which take place respecting the curtecy would be avoided if those two senss could be p ely distinguished. Money used as floating capital avalablefor discount is a different thing from money used for cirulation, It is true that gold is money in both senses, and it is equaly true that the gold sent to the Bank of Engaand in the shape of deposits is a
rtion of the fond avaUiable for discount. WTen, therefre, gold is exported from this country, when there Is a diain of sold, the ainount of CaPital available
for discount is diminihed. People afcordinglY look, as an hon. gentlema has observed, at the resrves of tmhe Bank as an index of the amount of nhoting capitol available at a particular time (althourh they do not contain the whole of that capital), because it is the practice of merchants to deposit their gold In the Bank, and the amount withdrawn from the rmerves is used for circulationin the country. The rate of interest of the Bank is also n index of the rate of inteorest elsewhere, but the Bank cannot raise or lower it at pleasare. in ordinary times, as the rate of interest requ'red
y the Bank is high, people in want of accommodation go were they can obtai, n it at a lower rate but at periods -hen accommodation is limited they have recourse to the Bank. I believe that the act of 1844 is the best and the least stringent of roles that can bo laid down, hut I do not wish to enterintothe discussioin of that topinow. The ariety of opinions which have been expressed is, in my mind, a suelaent reason for the appointment of the committee, where the suvbject would be far better sifted than by a discussion in this house. A select committee, composed of gentlemen of conafictin opinionst , who examined the witneses broug eolt , Is a fitter engine for the extraction of the trath in tha s matter than thisHoue, and

The country entlemen were told by their representatives in that iouae that they need not fear that if they charged their estates with the payment of pottions to their youner chillredn a day woold come whn, owing to the depreciation of the currency, those portions would be reduced in value by one-hal And that tromis applied to all parties. At that -time there was adouble currency, and Mi. Vansittart said that the whole of the national debt might be paid off in crooked sixpencesr if we had enough of them. Before the Bank Restriction Act the payment of silver was linmited to 25& in tale, but any amount, might be paid in gold. It was impossible to perform the corrupt contract that was entered into in 1819. The act of 1844 was intended as an attempt to do so, but it hadfied, as would also every future attempt in that direction. So great was the distre tOccasioned by the at of 1819 in the yearI82 that Lord Castlereagh proposed three measures for the express 3purposer ofevading that act. The banknotes werein. creased, and a false rospenity, which again produced dis.
tress was the reut ; and this country would be continualy the subject of similar altemating fluctuations until the source of the evil was thoroughlY a_cenrtaine, and the currency plaed on a sound bnsis. he contended that they ought to deal 'with tahe reserve notes of the Bank in exactly the same manner as they deal with the notes in the hands of the publcm. The twoment that the publi saw that the resrve in the hands of the Bank rmhed within a shade of the limit presibed by the act of 1844 demands were made upon the Bank by -the public, not for the purpos of trade, but for their own
prtection. As soon sas that limit was4 put an end to those demnands ceased. It was impossible to 'conceive what would inave bee,n the disastrous consequencs of tho act of 1819, had not the importation of about 157,000,0001. of gold from Australia come to our aid. Buat the framers Of that act had no right to calculate u depoithes sholdf gold in Australia. And enormous asd haednot the epoation. -of gold within the lAst few year,yet suchiwas the unfortunate operation of the act of 1819 that all persons looked with anxiety to the Arrival of the next halfmpillion of gold in this countrT. They inquired eagerly as tomwhat country the garrvalbmight be expected from, and whether it was probable that it would soon have to be exported to some other and to what country. Many people blamed the conduet of the Bank, but they could not help themselves. The operation of the act of Parlament compeled them to do what they did, and he ouly wondered that they managed so well He was glad that this question was to he referred to a select cOmmittee He 1rped that that committee would be impartially chosn, mand that the right hon. gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer himalf would go into the inquiry, not with a determination to adoPt a prticuar course, but with his miad open to conviction, an ith a disposition to hear and attend to all that could be advanced upon the subject. The riagmt hon. gentleman was not quite justified in saying th the reports of the comaittees were in favour of -theract of 1844, because the report of the committee of mthat House was only carried by a majority of 10 to 12, and two members were absent, who if present, would have voted with the mainority, ws le the report of the committee of the other, House was decidedly against the act. The hon. nember quoted from a speech delvered by the right hon. baronet the First Lorctof the Admiralty (Sir c. Wood) in 1847, to show that the -demands made by, the Scoteh bankers upon the Bank of .England was the cause of thes geap take in thatyeart hand in conclusion adduced, as another proof of the absurdity of the existing system, thtat if the demand for gold should go on to such an extent that tho depositors should withdraw their deposits, the Bank would not be able to pay them, uiness the Chancellor of the Exchequer paid in gold ,the debt of 14,000,L00f. due from the Government to the Bank.
Mr. WILKINSON believed that the Califomnian and Australian gold discoveries had added nothing to the wealth of the world. On the contrary, great distress had arisen from the accumulation of geld consequent upon tlemi, and the prices of comnmodities had boen raised to an extent that pressed mnost severely on the !eneral body of consumers.
Indealing with the question be lore them it was essential to lbear in mmnd that the rate of interest was p aid for capital, and not for the circulating medium. It was said the -rate of interest always -rose when the reerve of the Bank
-was low, and that it fell when the reserve was high. This was putting the cart before the horse, the truth being that the reserve was low because the rate of interest was high, and vice ver8d. The sole complaint during the last year against the act of 1844 amounted to this,-that somehow or .other it had raised the rate of interest. That act was not -the cause of the panic of 1847. Tha:trpanc -was owing.to outr system of credit, from which PeriodCal crses were inzeparable.
Mr. MUNTZ regarded the app ointment of the committ-ee as one of the greatest "1shams" ever proPosed to Parliamnent. If the act of 1844 was perfect, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer aile"ed, and required no alteration, of what earthlyt use could thme committee be, except to shift the responsibilitv froma the Government to the House? 'Unless the committee opened up the whole question its proposal would be an iusult to thke country as well as to the House. It was absolutely necessay to investigate the subject of joint-stock banks, with a view to the passing of a more stringent law for the punishment of acts such as those commnitted within the last 12 months, which -were a disgrace to any trading community - hut a committee to inquir into the act of 1844, upon suclh a statement as that of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, was nothing but sheer nonsense, and an insult to the nation. The obiect of the act of 1844, as avowed by Sir Robert Peel, was to take away all discretion from the directors of the Bank, the condition of convertibility not beingl sufficient to keep the Bank in order. The adoption of th
Eimit of 14,000,0001. was another great s'ham. _That limit hadI
and what possble effect could it therefore have on the cir: cvIation ? The variations in the value of money in this 4contry had never been so great, so frequent, or so injuriou
to industry as they had been since 1844. That was the great evil against which they ought to guard, and unless they did so all their legisation must be perfectly fut. e.
Mr. HILDYARD said that the Chancellor of the Exchequer having expressed so very strong an opinion in favour of the act of 1844 it was especially incumbent on him to constitute his committee fairly. The nomination of its members would, underthe ciTcumsntaces, be viewed with considerable jealousy, and if they were not impartially selected their report would have no weight with the
* Aonse, k*ich would have to take the whole matter 71&t its o'% hands again. The act of 1844 having been
tassei,for 149 years only, it was plain that its framers must vh..tdIuplted the necessity of altering its previsions frotiiasw tSi;me; and the itmmense expansion of our ex,tooftdmnport trade within the lIa decade, exceeding, in zet,.whole progreesit bad made within the previous hialtestry, was sgo dent of itself to create the pre. Sumption'at the machinery of the act of 1844 required
to e--idspted to the growing wants of our commerce. The, rnst Lord of the Admiralty laid ¶reat stress on the cirumstance that during the panioof 847theactual circin),ion wasbu:tii tlly dimini3hed; but the ri2ht hon. gentleman seemed to be iguorant of the fact that the eilm
l"tion was positively locked up from the alarm that prev led in the public mind. Aremarkaible iUnstration of this occurred witbin bis (Mr :Eild3ard's) own knowledge. On the Tuesday after the issue of the order in Council a wealthy man in the city went to his broker and directed him to buy him some stock, producing 10,000W. in large notes, each of which was cut in two. The broker, astonished to find the notes in that state, inquired the cause, and was told, " Oh ! I was so fearful that 1 did not
like to trust my banker with the un-cut notes, so I divided them into two; and kept one of the halvesinmryowndrawer." To raise the rate of discount mightbe avery proper mode of checking the drain of bulion, but it must be remembered that the fluctuations were rot so great before 184, when the Bank did not possess this engine, as they had been since. This showed that there were a great variety of circumstances to be taken into consideration in discussing this question, and the Chaucellor of the Exohequer ought therefore to take care that his committee was composed of gentlemen representing, as far as possible, all the different interests of the country. If he did not, his committee would not give satisfaction out of doors, and when its report was presented the House would have to go over the whole question agaiu.
Mr. IN'GRAM hoped tho committee would take into its consideration the present mode of managing the public debt. The gross charge made last yea- by the Bank of England for paying the pubEc debt was 247,3321., being an average of nearly 11. or each stockholder. There were 89,000 personswhose dividends were lessthan Q. each, and it was rather strange that the Bank should charge IL for paying 5. 'the railway companies did not manage their matters in such an extravagant manner. The expenses of paying the last year's dividends of the Manchester,Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway was only about Is. 6d. per shareholder, including the cost f transfers. The aystem of sending out dividend warrants, adopted by the railway companies, was much more convenient and afforded miuch fewer facilities for frauds than that followed by tho Bank of England.
Mr. ALEXANDER HASTIE thought the Chancellor of the Exchequer had made a great mistake in inferin from the non-receipt of answers to the six letters which he had written to tho Scotch banks that the operation of the act was satisfactory to the bankersof Scotland.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUEB.-My hon. friend misunderstood me. I said that I had received repEles, and that they all stated that the operation Of the act was satisfactory.
Mr. HASTIE could guess, then, to which hanks the right bon. gentleman had written. It could only be the char. tered banks, all of which possessed monopolies to a certain extent, which were satisfied with the operation of the act, but the other Seotch banks were greatly dissatisfied with the position in which they were placed by it. In 1853 five of them presented a memorial to the Treasury, complaining of the evils under which they were suffering, and as Late as the session of 1855 a bill had been introduced into that house, which received a second reading, for the purpose of removing some of those evils. He was far from wishing to say a word against the chartered banks, but the other banks were equally respectable, equally well managed, and equally enitled to the privileges of a charter. The Scotch banks generally had great reason to complain of the present system, and he hoped, therefore, that the Chancellor of the Excheluer would take care that Scotland was sufficiently repre. ~ented on the committee.
Mr. F. CROSSLEY was glad to find that twoseparate committees were to be appointed, for gentlemen who were weU qualified for one might not be qualified for the other. There were two reasons why this act should be looked Into-the enormous increase in the trade of the countrysinceIS44, and the rise in the prices of all kinds of raw material, which had necessitated the employment of so much more capital than before for carrying on trade. He did not go so far as some hon. gentlemen in thinking that the abolition of the present restrictions would be a panacea for all eviLq.
Mr. CAYLEY expressed his satifactlon at the candid and dispassionate manner in which the discussion had been conducted, observing that when he first occupied a seat in the house only one set of opions was allowed to be expressed on this subject, and any'one who disoented from them was almost cried down. The hon.member for Glasgow had said that the ChanwcUor of the Exchequer in making inquiries with respect to the state of the law relating to banks in Scotland had applied almost exclusively, if not exclusively, to the Scotch bankers. Now, he (Mr. Cayley) had always thought there were two parties interested in this question, the bankers and the public (hear, hear), and the interests of the public certaiyly deserved fuU consideration. (Hear, hear.) He thought the hon. member for Kendal (Mr. Glyn) had evinced great disinterestedness in the course he had adopted upon this question, although he could not concur in the hon. gentleman's suggestion that Mint notes should be substituted for those now existing, u such a change would necessarily involve a more entire correspondence between the circulation of the country and the bullon i; the Bank. Under the present system the banks obtained a large amount of profit. If they referred to the dividends declared by joint-stock banks they could not come to any other conclusion than that the present system was profitable to banks in general (hear, hear); but he thought the public was the party whose advantage they should keep chiefly in view when they were legislating upon this subject, for surely money was made for commerce, and not commerce for money. Some persons, however, argued the question as if that position was entirely reversed. The ChanceUor of tho E.xchequer In his opening speech had seemed to intimate that the committee apointed to investigate this subject in 1848 had reported in favour of the act of 1844, at the same time ignoring the fact, until he was reminded of it, that the committee of the House of Lords reported directly against the act of 1844. Now, what was the fact? He (Mr. Cayley) wa an member of the committee of 1848, and 17 witnesses were examined before that committee, including not only men of mercantile and general experience, but persons who were thoroughly acquaintedj with the whole routine of commerce-the great hilibrokers, am ong6 whom was 31r. S amuel Gurney Onty four out of those 17 witnesses were in favour of the act as it stood; and who wrere the four dissentients? The gentleman wrho was Governor of the Bank of England at the time the act was passed, Lord Overstone, and the Governor and Deputy Governor of the Bank in 1848. Hear, hear.) His hon. friend the member for Whitehaven had expressed a hope that the committee would be fairly composed If it was a fair committee, he (Mr. Cayley) could only say that he beleved it would be tho first fair committee that had ever been appointed to consider a subject of this nature. (A laugh,) During his experience he had seen a good many pked committees, and he knew how much adroitness was appled to their constitution. Great discreton was used in making a committee anpear perfectly fair, but good care was taken that there ould be sue
elements in the committee as would suffice to turn the scale in favour of particular views. He hoped, however, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would endeavour in this instance to nominate a really fair committee, for it would be the duty of that committee to investigate some points of the utmost importance to the countrs. It was surely a matter of great importance to ascertain the reason why the commercial body was so perpetually harassed by constant changes in the rate of discount. One of the great dceiderata in a medium of exchange was, that it should be as nearly as possibleofuniform value. As it was of essential consequence to commerce that the yard wand should be always of the same length, so it was important that the legal tender should, as far as possible, maintain a unfform value, but it was impossible under the present system to maintain that uniformity. They had in this country frequent commercial catastrophes and periodical prostrations of the mercantile interest, and it was tken for granted that they were natural results. He believed, however, that they were entirely the consequences of legislation. If the reserve of the Bank was excessively large, as it was in 1852 when it amounted to something like 20,000,0001., the directors, in order to make a profit, were obliged to go into the discount-market and compete with the discounting houses, and it was obvious that such operations of the Bank -the greatest money lender in the country-must produce a very great effect upon the rate of discount. When the amount of bullion increased the Bank went into the discount-market and lowered their rates. The billbrokers and other bankers were consequently obliged to lower their rates, which were occasionally so much depressed that in one year since 1844 the rate of discount fell to 1 per cent. When the rate of discount was so low holders of money, in order to gain additional profit, were induced to run some risks, and a reckless system of speculation was en-endered. All the money which was taken at the low rate of discount was used more or les irx the employment of labour; consumption was increased, wages rose, and consequently pnces were also raised, rendering this country the best market in the world for imports; but exports diminished because prices were high. If they wished to have the history of the five or six financial crises which had occorred since the peace, in a few words it might be told thus,-that prosperity drove gold abroad,land ruin brought it back. The only mode of getting back the gold was to lower prices in this country by raising the rate of interest, diminishing the period for which discount was allowed, and rendering it amost impossible for the public to obtain accommodation. The consequence was that goods were thrown into the market for sale at an immense fall of rices. The occurrence of periodical convulsions in trade and com merce was not natural, but a consequence of our artificial system. The public, seeing that such convulsions usually followed a drain of bullion, were full of apprehensions when it occurred, and no one could be surprised that they were so. There were about 20,000,0001. of bills in circulation, and these must be paid in banknotes or gold. . What, then, must be the state of the public mind when it was known that the resesve in tshe Bank of E;ngland did not exceed perhaps, 2,001,oool. or 3,000,0001.7 Could}it be wondered at if panic was the consequence. (Hlear, hear.) He hopd therefore, there would be a fair inquiry, with a view, if possible, to the discovery of a remedy for the .viis of the present system. (Hear, hear.)
The CHANCELIOR of the EXCHEQUER.-I will not trouble the House with any remarks in reply to the various
uestions whch ehbave been raised in the course of the evenng, but will confine myself to one or two observations with respect to the committee which I have proposed. I must say I was under the impression that it was the gen eral wfish of the House that there should be an Inquir. ("HSear I" from Mr. Spooner.) By the act of 1844 the privileges of the Bank of England could not be interfered with for a period of 10 years-z., till the end of 1855. The act deolares that it shall be.lawul, after notice given in this Hlouse at any time after 1855,to take step with a view to putting an end to the privileges of the Bank of England. The beginning of last year was therefore the firsittime the question of these privileges could benrised, and a motion wvas made in this house on the.su'oect befores Easter. I then stated it as my opinion th a time of war, when the country was placed in extraordinay crcum stances, was not.. a convenient period for entering into the consideration of the question. the Iouse was divided on the motion, when a ajerity concurred in the viewa which 1 had expressed. tater in the session a question was raised as to the appointment of a committUe of inquiry; I then stated that fitwasthe wsh'of any member to propose a committee, and if he brought forward a motion to that effect, I wouldhave no objection to his d iag so, though I thought it too late lin the session to be of much pr cticalimportance. No motion was mhde; and on the laa~day f th aesIo x&Aiaizx~l reply to a question, that I could °tf say wheitherri not it was the intention of the
Government to propose a comulttee when Parliament sgin I met. Whereupon an hon. meniber gave 3totice that he
would hiuself move fQr a committee. I was thereforeunder. the impression that if I had:moved for leave to bring in a bill on this subjectdwithotut any inquiry, anotber miotion
would have btee made foro and committee, to which I could not have stated any objcio,and therefore I have thxoughat

eIitber had the enormous amount' of gold brought into this country since 1848 been taken Into consideration. Since that year gold to the value of 175,00a,0001. had been discovered, of which no less than 135,000,0001. had been imported into this country. The disturbing forbe of thnat ele-. m6nthadInaturally beenverygreat,fcrthe importations had varied considerablyin amount, having only-been :1,900,(0 *l in some quarters of the itervenintyears and 3,000,001i inothers A msterial effect had een produced b these importatons upon the discount of the Bank, and the sab. ject vas one which he thought deserved the careualtention of the committee. In 1847 the Bankosuddenly reduced the rato of interest to 2e per cent., and in some instances the rate of discount wns only 1 per cent. The c;oriequence wias that enormous building speculationrs were underta[ken, and when the Bank found it necessary to raise the rate of interest the speculators became bankrupts. The largE number of workmnen now outof employment was attributable to this state of things. Ee conceived that a change was required in the constitution of the Court of Directors. Under the present system eight of the directors retired every year, and were replaced by eight other gentlemen who wtere On te list, so that financial plans whichpha been sanctioned by atmhjrit
in one week might be entirely changied the next week, in consequence of the admission of eight nof directors. ge hoped that full opportunity would be afforded,either in the committee or in the house, of discussing the imrtant points to which he had called attention.
Mir. BILLIE had understood the Chancellor of the Exchequer to say that he would absain, on the part of the Government, fromu indicating the- details of a measure On this subaect mntil fter the report of the committee had
eenp resented, and he (ilyr. Baillie) therefore conceived that the constid on of the committee, was a matter of ver serious smportance, for the opinionS entertained by the ad vocates of unrestricted and of restricted banking were as much opposed as were formerly the views of the Prote'
tioniut and Ereotraders. The Chancellor of the LEchequer had referred to the opinions or the late Sir B. o Peel on this question; buta those who recolected the discussions On the present Bank Charter Act would remember that Sir R Peel never regarded it as a finalmeasure. (Hear hear.) On the contrary, thet riht hon. baronet distinctly stated, wihen he introduced the bill, thathe intended to carry it much further, and that his ultimate object was that there ahould beo onl oe bank of issue. Indeed, Sir R. Peel gave private bankers throughout the counthy tounderstand that the privilege of issumic a would only be conceded to them for a period of 16yemrr

a slur upon those wvho did not assent to the act of 1844, but w hose object was, if pssible, tois prove the principle laid down in that act by extind ng rather than diminishing its operation. He would not enter at length into a consideration of the act of 1844, for he had no doubt the House would assent to thecmotionnof the Chahcellor of the Exehequer, and the subject itself was a very dry one. He might observe, hoever, that he had alfays regarded that act as dividing itself into three parts distinct from each other, and operating very differentl
with regard to the pubatc welfare. The firsttimpnortant portion of the act provided for the separation of the issue and btning departments; the second for the imitation of the amount of circulation advanced upon securities; and the third laid down regulations affecting country anks. With regard to the first of these provisions he did not hbo
sitato to say, although he knew it Was rather an unpopular doctrine, that, shough he had alwrays been an advocate fosUthe separation of the two departments, he regretted that the toen efts n tthe Bhanndks of thEBd Sank of England If there had been Dno statutory enactment ging to them the management of the circulation of the country the duty' might have been still in their hands.

The question could no longer be argued as it was in 1844. for there were now other bodies whomight step forwardandsay, "Wh not intrustthe duty tb USaswell as to the Bank of England 2" As to the third point (which he would notice before eferrngt the second), -viz., the regulationof the coantrybankissuesohe wasnot aware that there wasany such comalthenteredintomwiththem as the hon. member opposite (er.rdtie)ad alluded to Buth whatever the case might be, the renewal of the Bank A ct could not alter the position of the coantry bankers

It was impossible to advert to this without bearing in mind what took pulace in 1847, and it was remarkable how very anxious the advo cates of the bill were to get over the events that occarred in that year.

take in the matter of fact. The Bank directors did not reduce the rate of interest in 1847. They reduced it in 1846, acting upon the doctrine laid down by their friends, that they should look to their-sow reserve merel as bankers, and not to the amont of ballion. Accordingly, when they found their own till fnUl in 1846 they reduced the interest. At the same time thy were en titled to do so, for the bullion was increasing in the Bank. The fault of the Bank directors in 1847 was, that they did not in time raise the rate of interest, and when they did so they did it in g sradul way. With respect tomthe mitati
of the issue of notes to 14,000,0001, the rest of the issue being based on buhion, he had never heard an res

There was no corrective for this in the existence of the limit.

Mr. MALINS concurred with the l&as speaker in wishing the Chancelor of the Exchequer to divide the inquiry into two. Considering the disasters which had taken place during the last few years, involving points of the highest liuxportance, nLobody could doubt thaLt the -whole quxestion of joint-stock banks should undergo the most rigid investigation in regard both to management and mode of winding'a
The House was aware of the decisions which had recently been given in the case of the Royal British Bank, and of the misfortunes to which the shareholders in that concemn 'ere exposed. He hoped that the present session would not wcme to an end without an enactment beingpassed providing ti at after the winding-up of a joint-stock bank, or any joiutstock company, whether in the Court of Chancery or the Court of Bankruptcy, creditors ahould not be at liberty to sue individual shareholders to any extent they pleased. The proceedings in the case of the Royal British Bank were a disgrace to a civilized country. Debts had been bought up by litigious
ns for the sole purpose of suing the shareholders. - ,if after the win ung-up, the privilege of suing individual shareholders were abolished, and contributions to pay the debts of the bank or company obtained by means of calls, he had no doubt that the shareholders in every joint-stock concern would be found abundant!y competent to meet all the demands made upn them. There was thus no necessity for suing individualshareholders. He believed it had been ascertained that the shareholders in the Royal British Bank were able to pay the debt three times over by the system of calls; but as long as they allowed shareholders to besued by any creditorwho chose toraisean action the consequent litigation would cost more than the entire liabilities of the concern ; and the shareholders, instead of meeting their responsibilities at home, would fly to escape the monstrous cost of legal proceedings. (Hear, hear.) With regard to the main subject of debate-the Bank charter, he agreed vwith mr'ch that had been said by the last speaker but one. He had been disappointed with the speech of the Chancellor of the Ex-leequer, because, when be saw the notice on the paper, he did trust that the members of the Government would enter uTon the inquiry with a mind open to conviction. But the Chancellor of the Exchequer had expressed his satisfaction with the act of 1844, as being a piece of absolute wisdom; and, thertfore, if the Government were to have a preponderance in the committee, it would be vain to procaed with the investigation. (Hear, hear.) He trusted, however, that when the Chancellor of the Exchequer went into the committee he would be joined by men who had not so made up their minds; and, if that were so, the right hon. gentleman would find that the question was not so simple as he appeared to imagine. One of the many surprising statements made by the right hon. gentleman in the course of his speech was that the rate of discount had very little to do wnth the act of 1844. Now, during the whole of last winter we had what might be caUed a money panic, and the rate of discount, which since August had been as high as 7 per cent., was at the present moment 6 per cent. at the Bank of England. According to the Gazett of last week the amount of gold now in the Bank was 10,0OOOOLM, which being added to the imaginary 14,000,0001. mentioned in the act brought up the amount on which notes could be issued to 24,000,0001. He believed that the public had in their hands rather less than 20,000,0001., leaving reserved or unemployed notes to the amount of 4,b00,000l. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had stated that in 1842 the gold in the Bank of England rose to 20,000,0001., which addedto the 14,000,0OO. of the act, made a total of 34,006,0001. At that time the actualcirculation was 21,000,0001., leaving unemployed notes to the amount of 13,000,0001. The rate of discount was 3 per cent. Everything rose in price; great facilities were given to trade; many new undertakings were launched upon the world; but the inevitable crisis soon arrived, and traders suddenly found themselves overwhelmed with interest at the rate of 6, 7, and 8 per cent. Thab was the rate of discount at the Bank of England; the amount actually paid bytradera was much Qtier. When spending his Christmas vacation in the country he met a banker, doing considerable business, and asked him what his rate of dLscount wag. His reply was, "I charge three] per cent. more than the Bank of England," indicating a state of things fraught with ruin to the trading community. (Hear, hear.) The readers of the " city articles " of the journals, And par. ticularly of he Timnus, must have observed the pantin,
anxiety with which this great country waited the arrival of a vessel with 300,0001. in gold,-as if the nation actuaUy depended upon it to rave it from bankruptcy. What was the meaning of that anxiety, and how was it to be accounted for? The answer was that it was not gold tnat the country wanted, but banknotes. He would endea7our to make this clear. There was in the coffers of the Bank of England 10,000,0001. in gold, and the notes in circulation vere 20,000,0001. Now, the minimum circulation of notes for the 10 years previous to 1844 was 16,000,0001. ; during the 10 years between 1844 and 1854 it had never gone so low for any duration as 18,000,0001.; and he ventured to say that it would be impossible by any process now to reduce the circulation below that amount. In order to take the 10,0CO,0001. of gold from the Bank, however, the circulation must be reduced, not to 18,000,0001., but to 10,000,000L The public had in hand at the present momentsay, 20,OO,0001. of notes; and if the whole British community were to present thcse notes at once the Bank of England must necessarily stop payment, because the much vaunted syAtem which, according to the Chancellor of the Excbequer, it was impossible to improve, permitted 20,OCO,wl. of notes to be in circulation when there was only 10,000,0001. of gold to meet them. Sir R. Peel, however, knew that the circulation never would fal so low, and he assumed that it would never be reduced to less than 14,000,0001.; and therefore he allowed that number of notes to be issued nun imaginary security, every note being payable in gold, although there was no gold to meet it. (Hear hear.) It vas impossible at this time to reduce the notes in circulation to below 18,000,0001. * but, as the Bank waspossessed of 10,000,0001. of gold, the Bank could never be inconvenienced unless the circulation were reduced to 10,CCO,G00L; and therefore it was not gold, but banknotes, that the countrywanted. Then, as the Bank of England was compelled to buy gold at the rate of 31b 17s. 9d. an ounce, peopie were anxious for the arrival of ships with gold, in order that they might take it to the Bank, and thus compel the issue of additional notes. His assertion that it was the deficiency of banknotes which led to commercial disaster was borne out by what oceurred in 1847, when we were upon the eve of a national bankruptcy. On the 25th of October in that year, when the celebrated letter was written, the gold in the Bank was 8,000,OGO., and the circulation was 21,000,0001. It was impossible that there could have been any stoppage of the Bank, therefore, unless the circulation had been reduced to 13,000,0001. There was no fear of that ; but this difficulty might have arisen -that while there was 8,000,0001. of gold in the Bank the directors might not have had a single noto to issue. The unemployed notes were then reduced to ,500,000.L, and representations were made to the then Chancellor of the Exchequer (Sir C. Wood) that unless something were done there would be a national bankruptcy. Something was done; the Bi_nk was authorized to issue notes beyond the 14,000,0001. to the additional extent of the quantity of gold in the Bank, and by that means the difficulty was surmounted. A relaxation took place, and the rate of discount rapidly fell. He was surprised that the Chancellor of the
cequr, with that examule before him, should say that there should be no relation now, but that it would be better to leave these cases always to the extraordinary intervention of Govemrnment, preferring, e, it seemed to him (Mr. Malns), the transgression of the law to leaving the remedymg power within the law itself.I T.wssito hsewoddntapov h c f14
It; WaS saild of tho'se who' dd not approve the act of 1844 that they were in favour of an inconvertible issue. Now, he, for one, could not be included in that list, for he did not see any occasion for the iuconvertibility of the banknote, for during the year 1847, and during the petyear, the goldin the Bank had nevc -been exhausted. . effect of creating two departments, as the act of 1814 had done
had been to lock up the gold, and to make the rate of dis-
caunt to depend on the quantity of reserve notes, and the result had been that the commercial transactions of this DountrY had n3ever been in a satisfactory state when the reserve notes fell below 5,000,0001.; for if they fell below that amount up went the rate of discount, for the increase in the rate of discount was not occasioned by any scarcity of gold, but by the diminution of the reserve notes. The effet of those changes in the rate of discount, and the uncertainty with regard to them, was highly injurious to commercial trans.

(Hoar, hear.)
Mr. LAING said that when the hon. and learned momnber for Wallingford advocated an unlimited issue of banknotes. Alr. Malisn-" I did not.'l The argument of the
on. an learned. gentleman was that the pressure in the money-market arose from the small circulation of banknotes, and yet he was in favour of their convertibility. Now, he could not understand how both those propositions could hold. If there had been a continually increasin drain upon the bullion, and more banknotes were issueod how could that drain be resisted if the notes were convrieble ? This was no theoretical question; for had they not seen only recehtly in a neighbouring country no less than 2,000,0001. of bullion disappear from its coffers in a single month? If that process h one on for a short time in this country it would have brought us completely to the end of our tether, and then what would, havo come of the mnoonvertibility of the note? If it was true that the conton. -was labouring under a deficiency of banknotes, how was it that the aggregate anmount of banknotes was now positively grester than at several former periods when money was a drag in the market at 2 per oent. ? The total amount of the circulation in the hands of the public towards the close of the past year was 40,000,0001., and the circulation of the Bank or England alone was 2LO00,0001 Let the House look back towards the close of 1846, when speculation was rampant, and the rate of interest was unprecedentedly low. What, then, was the circulation of Bank of England notes ? Why, in Sept-mber of that year it amounted to 21,465,000., or within a mere fraction of what it was now. The hon, and learned gentleman had been led into error by his interpretation of the term "money." In one sense money meant capital. It meant that portion of the capital of the country whch was available for commercial purposes; but that was a very different thing from the total capital of the country, the great bulk of which was invested in the funds oron mortgage, and the owners of which would never lend it in Lombard-street at 6l. per cent., knowing, as they did, that in 12 months that might mean 21. per cent. Turn it as they would, there was no way of dealing with the subiect exoept uon the principle of adJusting the supply to the demand. lrtthe demand for money exceeded the supply money would be scarce in spite of any expedient they might adopt to make it otherwise. When the money-market was dear, there was noway in which they could restore the equilibrium except by diminishing the demand or increasin the supply. ow could they do that? Why, manifestly by increasing their rate of interest. That, he believed, was the whole art and mystery of banking (hear, bear)-namely, to regulate the supply according to the demand. Althou2h he agreed with the ChanceUor of the Exchequer in the main in the soundness, both of his principles and his con. clusions, he thought the right hon. gentleman had hardly shown a sufficient case for going into committee in one respect. The right hon. gentleman described the act of 1844 as having been passed simply and solely for the purpose of insaring the convertibility of the paper money issued by the 3sank. That might be true if they looked merely at the letter of the act of Parliament, bat it was not true if they looked at the circumstances under which the act was introduced. It was introduced on the theory that if they regulated their circulation by a self-acting process the simple effect of the regulation of the circulation would be to keeD them right on aU other poinits. Of that tbeory Lord Overstone was the most distinguished advocate, and everyone wished it to be true, but unfortunately it was not true (" Hear, hear I" from Mr. Malins); it was contradicted by fact. If they looked to any of the returns of the circulation in-periods of great pressure on the money market-they would flndthere was absolutely no connexion between them. The period of 1847 was a remarkable one. It was proved in evidence before the committee that between October, 1846, and September, 1847, upwards of 7,000,0001. had been drained away while the amount of notes in the hands of the public remained almost exactly the same. He contended therefore that the theory was contradicted by fact, and the reason was, that it overlooked the operation of the reserve of gold existmg in the Bank. The effect of the act of 1844 undoubtodly was, that it provided for the convertibility of the circulation, but it rnade no other provision for the banking reserve. That, at this moment, depended npon the sound discretion of the Directors of the of England as much as it did before the act of 1844 was passed. In 1847 it had a mischievous effect, in that it induced a false confidence on the part both of the Directors of the Bank of England and of the public, which prevented recourse being had to restrictive measure,; but he thought that error had been completely exploded by subsequent experience, for latterly tho Directors of the Bank had exercised a sound discretion, and had carried the country through a period of great difficlty and trial. That error, he thought, was now so perfectly well known and understood by aU men of business that, in looking now at the act of 1844, the House might leave out of view the erroneous theory on which it wasfounded. HIehadsaid that the whole question resolved itself into one of the banking reserve. It wa-s desirable that the banknote should be always convertible and that, ho thought, was effectuaUy done by tie act of 1844. One point to be observed was to secure the solvency of the Bank, aud insure its power to meet its notes. It was also desirable that while maintaining its reserve to secure its solvency the Bank should also have the power of supporting the credit of the country in times of emergency. By that expression he did not mean to convey that the Bank should be bound to step in to support every large house which had traded imprudently, or had locked up its capitalAin unavailable resources; but he meant that the Bank of England, possessing privileges which no other bank had, and being the bankers of the Government, it had a peculiar power which made it the last resort and foundation of that large superstructure of commercial credit in this country. All the operations of the private banks were based in a nTeat mexaure upon the conviction that in times of difficulty or pressure they could obtain assistance from the Bank of England by the deposit of securities. If the Bank permitted its reserve to run too lowv it created panic, because persons in trade perceive the risk, not of an excessively high rato of interest, which they could bear and wbich cannot be prevented, but they fear an absolute stoppge, and that a period may arrivo when the Bank of England wila not be able to make advances upon the best private or Government securities. That was thestate of things in 1847, when the Bank of England, having suffered its reserve to ran too low, it was compeled in self-defence, to avoid a complete stoppage, to curtail the accommodation which it usualy afforded to trade. The great problem was how to prevent a recurrence of that state of things. A suggestion had been made that there should be an increase in the issue of notes beyond the fixed limit of 14,000,0001., but he could not see how the mere creation of paper would increase tho amount of available capital to be employed in the business of the countr. It would simply displace so much bullion, which woud then find its way abroad. Some allusion had been made to the limit of 14,000,0001. to which the Bank was restricted and some hon. members could not see why thJat amount had been chosen in preference to any other; but the reason was that in practice that amount had been found to be sufficiently below the minimumn point to which the circulation could be contractedto give valid security withoutriskig inconvertibility. It had been said that 14,000,0001. was too little at one time and too much at another, and if there were 20,000,0001. of bullion in the Bank and notes were issued to the full extent, there would then be 34,000,0001 in notes; but, in fact, that was not so, as the Bank could not keep out more than 20,000,000k,andthe practicdl result wonId be a smaUer reseive. Such a state of things might affect the rate of interest, but, practically, there could be no over-issue of notes-a circulation bon4 fidc convertible could not be in excess. The whole question hinged upon being able to keep up the reserve to the highest point possible. In 18 I17 the difficalty really arose from that cause-that, in a period of pressure when the reserve had fal.len inconveniently low, the act of 1844 ptrevented recourse being had to the issue
department, and taking from thence a certain portion of the bullion, which was, as it were, pawiied therefor specific purposes. The true remedy appeared to him to be toaccumulate, in times of prosperity, * larger re-
serve, and, when pressure came, to alopt measures of contraction earlier and moreenergetically, so as not to allow the reserve Fo faU too low. T'he real difficulty was that the interests of tho public and of the Bank of England were not always identical. (Hear, hear.) It was the interest of tho Bank, with a view to the dividend for its sbareholders, to work with the minimum reserve compatible with its own secarity, while the interests of the public was that a largo reserve should be accumulated in prosperous times, and not suffered to fall too low in times' of .pressnre. The object to be desired could not be obtained without somne nnderstanding botvreen the Bank and the Government, as it would not be reasonable to ask the shireholders of the Bank, without compensation, to make the sacrifice wvhich would be entailed by kebping up a larger reserve for the national benefit, If some plan could be dovised.to meet that diffic ultyit wonldbe tiostvaluable. Something had been said about a discretionaiy power to relax the rule affecting the reeorve, but he feared tho knowledge of that power would afford a temptation to allow the reserve to sink too low, and thus -diminish the seefrity of the Bank. If anything was to be done inthe way of croating an extraordinaryrsee~ it must baby n cumu lating a dbnd jlcc reserve upon scuritiSes or bnUion, to eb brought out in
timea of Tressure by a temnporary arrangement between the Bank aid theGovernisnt. It was important to go into cmmitee, if only to see vhether some aragement could not h e made by which the -Bank might consent to the sacrifice of keeping upa larger rsenrve for the beiefit of trade ind 6ommerce. There were' ether tutetions-ach at the
Inanagement of the Bink-w'hich could be wel consiered
in cemrittee. At preseht, if there was a good governor or deputy-goveinor, thei wass.no certinty that he would remain in office aove two years. It wa de sirable. that a committee'sbould be appoited, and if it did rothing bt adopt some rusolutioa iipoh that point,it woorAd not be yaluelesms.
Xhr. JA)IE8 M'GXEGOR expirssed an eaniest hop6 tlat iome means might be found to prevent a recurince of tbe horribe state o! things whihh prevaied in 1847. The panic
pon thatoccasion'ws uot -tked-by-thsicreigu-e mau for gold; it waS a- domestic IauI, as WA proved by -the -fact that -after the issae of the. letter- relaxin; the Bank Act in Octhber, 1847, it speedily ceased. He trsted thai som* means would be found for averting the horrors of such a panicas that of 18&7,-and giving ao:aeelaticity to-the act of 1844. With regard to joint-sto,k banks, tethought- the principlb of limited liabiiity would be better than the present aystemn, but upon so lirge a uo,tion ho hoped tho Chenolloe r of the Escheqtuer r;oald appoint a separate committee.
Mr. URQtTiRART said it appeared to him there were two glUestions to be considered with res2ect to tho. act of
-4-first was it sufficient to maintain the credit or7 the Bank and tne conyertibility of its notes under all circamstancos? and, next, did it contain provisions unneoess4rily embarrassin to commerce? Although it was true, as L )rd Asliburton nad statea in a pamphlet, published in 1,i3, that no act of Parliament could give ccrtain convertihility tonotws under every contingency wrhich might arise yet he beleved the present act did make notes conVertibie and tnable the sank to mneet aU demands by deposiors. Tho circumstances of 1847 showed what the Bank was able to do. There were two crises of no usmall importanco in that year. The' first was in the spring, in consequencenO adverae exchanges, the scond was in the autumn, in consequence of an internal demand for gold. In the first crisis the Bank, though they might not have raised the rate of discount sufficieantly soon, didraise it in time to snake the exchango in our favour before the second panic occurred, and white it lasted the convertibility of notes was never in any daffger. A crisis very similar to that of 1847 occurred in 1839, when the exchanges were turned against us in consequence of a bad barvest, and on that occasion there was great danger of the suspension of cash payments, but for the timely assistance of tho Bank of France. There was also a crisis in 1825, caused by an internal demand for gold, and if the crisis which followed in 1839 had followed as quickly a3 the autumn panic of 1847 followed on the spying panic of that year, he did not think he took in exaggerated view in saying that both the convertibility of noteg and the security of deposits would have been in the greatest daugoi. He knew that many people thought the act of 1844 broko down n 1847; but the fact was that the difficulties of 1847 were caused by the failures of corn speculators, although thoso difficulties were, perhaps, aggravated-by a misconceptidn of the Bank Act. Ho ws aware that a great many persons blamed the act in consequence of tho many minor panic; which had occurred since 1647. Now, he considered that it was no maUl praise of the actual working of tho act, if it had made the people of England properly sensitivo *ith regard to their credit. 'With our commercial system and relations, if any false system of credit enled us to tide over a timo of adverso exchanges, it -was sure, sooner or later, to bring about disaster or ruin; and this it was tho particular object of tho act of 1804 to avoid. Ho did not pretend to stand up for all the details of the act, and the practical effect of those details would be much better discussed by gentlemen who had obtained their knovwledge on the subject at the counters of their banks or on thel Stock.Exchango than bythose who had to gain an acquaintance with it m theic library. He did hope, however, that the House woald not let it be understood that it was an-ions to interfere with the main principles of an act which he could not but think had been ound to answer extremely well the purposes for which it had been framed. (Hear.)
lr. NEWDEGATE thought that the objecEtions of. the hon. memberfor Kendal (Mr. Glyn) to an absolute limit were unanswerable, and that it would be highly advisable, after having assigned some limit for the issue of securities, to deride that when gold sank to a certain point the rate of interest should absolutely advance par! passu with the diminution of gold. The point, however, to which he wishod particularly to draw the attention of the Government and of the future committeo was this:-Bv the act of 1844, in lien of making a payment to the Bau
for doing the business of Government, Parliament placed in their hands the reserve notes and told them to go and ttade with them in the discount-market. This provision had given the Bank an enormous power in the discount-market, including virtually that of deciding the rise or fal of the rate of 2nterest; and, judging by the experience they gained in the panic of 1847, the Bank directors found themselves bound to regulate the rate of interest in a great measure according to the amount of buUion in their coffers. When their stock of bulion was large they encouraged specalation, and whenit was mnaltheyrepressed specuation, by varying the rate of interest. Now, would it Inot ba wise to place a limit upon the power of the Bank to stimulate speculation when the amount of bullion in its ceUars was lIage In theso cases excessive spoeculation and commercial panic acted and re-acted upon one another, -and surely it was not prudent that the Bank should derive advantage from, and have it in its power to encourage speculation at such times as ho had indicated. Ho ac owlegee
that the Bank directors had, on the whole, exercised their discretionarypower very wisely, but the present systemn served asa directinducement to them to stimulate an undue pirit of speculation, while at other times they revenged themselves upon the commercial tpublic when there was a reaction by raising the rate of interest and restricting their advances.
Sir e. WOOD.-I am anxious to sot the Honse right upon ono or two points of fact which have not been aaccurately stated by hon. gentlemen who have preceded me. It seoms to me that while hon. gentlemen opposite protest that they are advocates for the convortibility of the banknote, yet that the doctrine they put forward is inconsistent with the certain maintenance of that convertibility. (Elear, hear.) I am not quite certain as to the precise plan of the hon. gentleman (Mr. Newdegate), but I have little donb' that if the course he advocates had beon adopted the securiyfor the convertibility of the noto would have been iery seriously diminished. Let the House remeamber how the question of the " little shilling" arose. After the suspension of cash payments, when the question arose of restoring tho convertibility of the note, the question also arose a3 to the standard. Any course that renders paper inconvertible may lead to a state of things in which that question must be again urged, of not restoring the standard to the point at which it had before boen, and of paying a less amount of gold than had boon promised to be paid. That was the doctrine of tho "little shilling." The hon. member for the Wick burghs told us what was the purpose'of the act of 1844. Now, this is not the first time that gentlemen have undertaken to describe the objects of this act, but I do not think it fair to say what the objects of the biUl were, except in the words of its authors. The hon. gentleman says that this bill was to be the remedy for aU possible evils, and that it was to prevent not only an over issue of paper, but also any excess of speculation. I say that no such doctrine was ever professed by those Wvho advocated the biU of 1844. (Ecar, hear.) I happened to take a large part in the discussions on that bWl, and I distinctly remember what everyone said was, that it was impossible for any bill to deal with rash speculations, and -with the mismanagement of banking concerns; but that there bad been superadded to those evils the mismanagement of the circulation, and for that the biU wonld be an adequat X remedy. Ths evils of excessive credit and mismanagement of banking concerns have occurred in all countries-in Holland, where every note was represent d by silver or gold in the bank; in Belgium, and even in countries where no paper circulation existed. It is not necessary in ordez that banking mismanagement should exist that there should be any notes in circulation. The bill of 184 regnlated the circulation of the country, and its object was to put a proper limit and checkto the possible mismanagement of the circulation. We ae apt in discussing measurie of this kind to forget the evils that were complained of when they were past. In old times many complaints were made that the management of the Bank was left to the discretion of the Bank directors. It wvas thought essential by almost every one that there shouldcbe some limit or check or rulo by which the circulation should be managed. The bon. member for Kendal has laid down a rale which I will not now discuss, but that some rule should be laid down ha; been the opinion of almost aU persons who hold the convertibility of the note. It was necessary to take care, in order to secure the convertibility of the note, that the hote circulation shonld- vary exactly as the metalic circulation should vary. The mode of attaining this object was by isueng a certain number of notes on security, and takincare that the rest shall be represented by an amount of gola in the hands of the issuing parties. Hon. members have nsked why the sum of 14,000,000. was fixed upon. I believe that the minfinwun amonmtof notes that had everbeen in the hands of the public had been somewhere about 15,000,0001., end the sum of 14,000,0001. was taken as an amount below which it was improbable, if not impossible, that the notes in the hands of the publio should sink. The primary object of the bil was to secure that the amount of circulation of silver and gold should vary precisely as the circulation of the notes of the Bank should wary. I agree with my right hon. friend the Chancellor of
tbe~ Excbequer an te o.mmesi thinkieg'that niot much benefit would be derived fromn raising the sum of 14,01 0,OCO?. Any other sum of about that amount would cquafly attain theoobject, The sole advantage wouald be-that an increased aimount would set loose so mnuch geld which might be used in other ways. Whatever advanitage and economy there are in issuing notesinhstead of gold will be attainedhby fixing t'he amtount a little higlher. bDut I do not thisiik that hon, gentlemen opposite would find that any greater laxity of circulation wouldbe attained. Hon. gen.
tls men baving entered upon- the questioii of the rAe of interest, I munst beg leave to say. that the rate of interest does mot dependi uponL the amonUIt Of nDote in circulation. That was shown when we went into commnitteo by num4rons wyitnesses, and it was stated repeatedly In:' the discussibeig 'hich afterwards took jdace. Th~e floatin cauital of the country is' sent up to London to te used as1 discount. If there is an abundanee of suck floating capital, the rxte of interest is low; if, on the contrary, it isamcare, the rate of interest rises. The rate;of interest therefore miust aepEnd uFion the abundance or scarcity of avaial pmLf ar ber.

PASSING TOLLS.
The House then went into Committee, when
Mr. LOWE rose for leave to bring in a bill for the abolition of passing toils. He said when he introduced- the Local Dues Bill last year, though there were a great many strong observations directed against the bil and aepinst himself ho did not think that any of them were applied to the abohfton of the passing tolls, which formed a part of that bilL The Government therefore had thought it desirable to separate this question, which was one of great interest to thoso connected with shipping, from the more disputable topics with which it was involved lastear. He might explain that the places which had the privilege of levying gssang tols were four-Dover, Whitby,;Ramsgate, and Brilington. They were imposed under the idea that the harbotrs of those p laces were established harbours of refuge for shippings. It turned out, however, when examination took place, that not one of these harbours were harbours of refuge. Two of these vere dry at low water, and had only a few feet of depth at high water. It therefore resulted that theY could not be harbours of refuge for shipping of the largest class, and it was therefore felt to be a great grievance that the shipping interest should be called on to payamnually a sum of more than 33,0001. for these tols On Bridlington and Whitby there s a debt of 60,0001. In the case of Dover there was what was called the interior harbour, but the Admiralty were constructing a large harbour !or abipe which would now be almost exdusively used. The tolls levied on passing this interior harbour were 12,0004. a-year, though it was now of very little avail, and when the new harbour was built would be of hardly any use. There was upon it a debt of 85,0004, which was partly paid out of these passing tolls. What the Government proposed was that-the passing tols sbould be abolshed, and that the harbour of Dover, with all its liabilities and debts, should be taken over by the Admiralty, so that the shippig would be relieved from the existing charges, and the creditors would have the security of the Admiralty, instead of the 12,0001 a-year which he had mentioned. The passing tolls of Bridlington were levied on coals only, although the object for which they were charged was intended for the benefit of all shipping. The harbour ws dry at low water, and was ill-situated in aD respects as a harbour of refuge. The amount collected was somewhere about 2,8001 a-year, and these was debt to the amount of 28,000l. The act under which the tols were levied expired in 1868, and what he propo8ed was that the GCovernment should pay oft the debt of 28,0001., and that the tolls should cease at once. Whntby was almost in the same situation as Bridlngton. The pssing tolls amounted to 4,1111 a-year, were levied entirely on coals, and were encumbered with a debt of
aprpsdto pay ont of the public funds the debt of 32,0P00 6adnd to abolish altogether the
tax of 4,1111 4r annum, which was levied on the coal ships comninz out or thoold port of Newcastle, now, of course, including Shields. The case of Ramegate was a little more complicated, and therefore his statement with respect to it must be more minute. The harbour was situated close to
the anchorge of the Downs. In 1748 there was a great tempest, and many ships found refuge in the Ramsrate harbur. In consequence of the relief to sbipping then experienced certain merchants of London petitioned Parliament to make a, harbour of refuge at Ramnsgate. The petition was granted; the village of Raimsgate-for at that time it was no more than a village-gave u;eto the Government its harbour and some gronund a jacent to it, which was then yielding a rental of about 31. per annum; and upon that ground the Government bad expended from that day to this somethins like 2,000,0001. He could not say that thatwasavery provident expenditure, because the harbour was difficult of entrance, there were only eight feet of water at low tide, and being removed from the track which vessels generaly followed it -was not usfuf l for ships going on their course, hut ratheras a place to relieve the anchorapg of the Downs of the smaller kind of vessels, and so prevent accidents. The Government was now expending a large sann of monery in the repair of the harbour, and, as far as he could judge at the present moment, 21,0001. would sti be required. The passing tolls levied at IRamsgate, principally on shipping which derived no sort of benefit from the harbour, amount to 14,000h a-yea- therewas no debt. Whatheproposed was that the 21006. whiceh would stil be required to put the harbour in repair should be paid by the Government, and that the passing tolls should cease from the passing of the act. It was estimated by the trustees- for the harbour had hitherto been in the hands of oertain merchants of London, who actedl as trutstee-that the expense of mauagement had been about 20,00045 a-year. It was proposed to put an end to this trust, and to vest the harbour amd the nroperty aijacent, on which 2,000,0001. had been expended, in Her Majesty, placing them under the care of the Board of Trade. It was estimated that that board, having facilities fos it which the trustees ba not, could manage the harbour for 7,5001. a-year. To make up that sum there were the following items :-the property vested in the present trustees, consisting of houses, docks, and land, and pro. duciag 4,4001. per annum ; a duty of 3d. per ton, which it was proposed to impose on ships using the harbour not for the purpose of refuge, and whlich it was estimated would amount to something like 500. a-year; a proposed tax of 3d. on each passenger landed at the quay, of which the probableyiel wasestimnatedat6O4 ; 5percent. npon salvage broughtinto the harbour, or 50.a-yearmore;in al6,0001. per.annum. A farther sum of nearly ZOOO2. a-year was
erved from a tax levied by the Town Commissioners on all coals imported into Ramagate. It was proposed to transfer that tax to the harbour fund, thus rasing the income to a little more than 7,500L a-year, or sufficient to cover the expenditure. He was afraid, however, that they could not rely upon the coal-tax as available to the extent stted, because there was a close competition between the rawlway and sea carriage, and le believed the railway was rather ga.nin on its antagonist, so that the amount pro.
yd tie tax was likely to suffer some diminution. Nor was he altogether sure of the estimates with respect to the other sources of income ; in fact, there was reason to fear that some payment from the Consolidated Fund would be required to rmeet the exnditure. He had mentioned these facts because he was aware that a complaint would be made on behalf of Ramgsate that the Goverunment proposed to inflict a great hardship on that town. It would be said that the harbour of refuge was made for Government purposes, and not for the purposes of the town, and that therefore the Government ought to pa-y all the expenses. It would also be said that RInmsgate gave its harbour and ground adjacent, and had therefore contributed its share towards the harbour of refuge iHe bad already stated the value (31 per annum) of the land gven by
amagate i and while hae admitted that the harbour was made for the benefit, not of Bamsgate, but of the shipping at the Dow ns, it was also true that the harbour and the enormous expenditure of 2,000,0001 had made the town what it was, and, what was more, hadmade the sands which formed the greatest attraction of the place. It was therefore only reasonable that Bamsgate, having received so much advantage, should share in a moderate degree in bearing the burden of the harbour. He did not mean to say that it ought to bear the larger portion, nor would it The sum of 4,5001. in round numbers would be furnished by the town, and something considerable-he did not knowhow much-by the Consolidated Fund. Seeing thatthe ConsolidatedFnd hadalreadycontributed2,ooo00, ltotheharbour that 21,0001. more would be required for repairs, and that a large annual sum would in future be drawn from the same sourcetomeet expenditure, hethoughtit would not be reasonablethat.amspteshouldcontinaeto levy for its own municipal purposes a tax upon coals, chiefly those used in the dredging machines which kept the harbour open. Such, then, was the proposal of the Government. It included the abolition of the passing tolls, the payment of the debt oat of the Consolidated Fund, and the relief of shipping from the burden of something like 33,0001. per annum. The right hon. gentleman concluded by moving for leave to brng in * bill for the abolition of passing tolls.
Mfr. DEEDES admitted that the idea of abolishing the
g tolls was so agreeable to the countrv at large that aeshould finld it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to convince the committee that it ought not to be entertained. He would not undertake so hopeless a task, bat mierely wished to state that the proposal now made by the Vioe-Przesident of the Board of Trade appeared to I lac
Dover and Inamgate in a differenit from the bill of last year. The bil of last session was to be referred to a select committee, and thepartiesaffectedwere tobeheardbefore an mpartial tribunal. Now, howeevear,it was proposed to deal with hemin ver summry maner,and noopprtunjty wa t b aoredthm f tain teir cae uly and fairy. Wth rspet toDove hediffred romthe right hon. gentlemanin teh¢inking that the inner ha was now
of comParatively little importance. fle h..iaes 5Ait eonld
be shown on the best engingeri au that ithI was of the greatest possible use, and would continue
to beso. As for Ramsgate, he w as not preparcdto adiut
that it was right or fair that the people of that town
should be taxedinm respect of their consumption of coals to keep up a haroour of refuge for the benefit of the shipping attlieDovWn. Butall heaskedonthesirnpart was that their
case might be fairly investigated by the touse.I 3Mr. RICE did not wish or intend to offer any onposition to the introduction or the progress of this bill. the time had arrived when the question of these passing toDs ought to be settled; and, as far as Dover was concerned, he
regarded the proposal of the Vice-President of thle Board of Trade, assuming it to be the same as that of Last year, ass fair and equitable arrangement.
Mbi. VANC suggested tbht the tolls which were paid
upon ships entering Dablin harbour, and which were analogous to the passing tolls to which the right bon. gentlen had referred, ahould cease to be levied. .
Mr. 'CANN urged that, if the hlarbours which had been en umerated by the right hon. entleman were to receive any beniefit from the consolidated fund, the harbour of Ireland* should not be forgotten.
Mr. W. S. LINDSAY thanked his right. hon. friend
for having introdued the bill thus early in the aession, because it was high time that passing tols should X abolished. As an instano of the oppressive nature of tbistax;' he stted that the sinle port of Sunderland paid 1,3001. aear to Whitby harbour, and that sbips from the north of Eyngland rbich were bound to the Baltic, and did not pans W haitby at all, were complled to pay it.
Mr. JAMES M'GRtOOR asked what was intended to be done with respect to Sandimch harbour ? A. great injury wias inflicted upon that harbour by the construction of
Bainagate harbour, in consequence of which the 1commis; sioners of Ramegate harbour were to pay 10,004O tothe !conlnui.sioners of Sandwich. 4,001. of that sum had been ,raised by the connsisaionera of iteudwich harboour, and the
csarclnstonbrsof Rmempto now i*ii the interest, amount. figto 2001.a-year.-
J'. LOWE said thAtSeadwlch harbour was not in any rsata harbour of ;refuge,. and that It was therefore ngot entitled to any rionoftheawng tolls. Heapprekended th Utierate le'tidatDublhn was not strictly in the mature of& Puesiog to,,l4
Viscount GAL.WAY said that ho bad no 'atcut"r conrm in this mittdr hiniself nor had le been able to gather muads of the nature of- the till, owingto the rapid delivery of the right hon. gentleman wio had introduced iL He would recommend lion. members kowever, to take care of theirown interests, because the ight hon. gentleman had publeldcr staed last ear that he had no respect for parchsnenttte.
M1r. BRA7.ILEY-3M0ORE was of opinion that the ps ug tolls which it wras proposed. to abolish wore no hardi
upontheshipwue, seing that thney were poai by the consignee, and that they eventually fell upoL the consUlner.
Mr. INGHAM took a different view, and urged that now, when the competition between the railway and shipping i-n terest6 was so great, every tax wlhich operated to the prejudice of the latter should be removed.
Mr. M'GIEGOR complained of the gross injustice which the right hon. gentlematn proposed to igflict upoin his constituent. No one ever supposed for a moment that Sandwich was a harbour of refuge; bat it had been mnortgaged to the extent of 4,000., in consequence of the injury which had been done to it by the construction of Iaisgate harbour; and Ramsgate paia 2D01. a-year intereat upo
that 4,O0.d The right-bon. gentleman now told them that
psigtolls wouild ceaae, and that that 2001. a-year was to cease a ; but he had not told them that he pounced upon a large sum of money now in the hands of the commais. sioners of Ransgate, which they held subject to the equitable elaim of Sandwichi harbour. He (Mr. M'Gregor) was confident that Parliament would not allow such an injustice to bo perpetrated. (Hear, hear.)
:Mr. LOWE aid that the subject referred to by the hon. gentleman would be more apropriately discstat a sub xequent stage of the bill. There was, however, one observa. tion which nad been made by a noble lord opposite (Lord Galway), whiea appeared to have been intended to be offensivei to himsel.1, to which bie wished to refer - for if he were to be censurd let it Be for what he had and not for what he had not said. He had not, as the noble lord bad repre sented, "pken sliglitingly of titl es derived from parch2nents; but, in the syeech to which the noble lord had refer. red, what ho had said was that persons who derived a title by an act of Parliament meaning the act of 1835, had no occasion togoto parchment foratitle. Hebelevedtheexpression "musty parchmentW' wascomplainedof, but all that he had meant was that persons who had a claim under an aot of Parliament had no occaLsion for parchment titles.
Lord GALWAY had not intended his observation to be offensive to the ribt lhon. gentleman; but, holding the position which the nght hon. gentleman held, it was especially incumbent oR him. in introducing matters of importance to tho House, to be very guarded in the expressions he made use of. He could only say that titles on parchment, whether musty or of ouly 60 years' date, would be viewed with consideration as long as law prevailed in this country.
The House then resumed, and the bill was brought in by Mr. Lowz asd read a first time.
The House adjourned at five minutes to 12 o'clock.

ZONDOZAV SATURZDAY, FP RO2Y 7, 17.
In the House of Lords last night
The LORD CEC LLOR, id reply to Lord B3ouoaMf, entered into bOmo explanAtions as to. the Church Discipline Bill.
Some other unimportUnt businew was also desPatched, aftet which their Lordships adjourned.
In tho Houge of Commons, ir. reply to Mr. BAnM,
The C,iCEzT;oa of the EXCIIQ stated that, by an arrangement betwreen the as3t India Conmpany and the GEovernmnent respecting the expenses of the Persian war, one-half of the extraordinary
expenses -Would be paid out of the national Exohe. suer, adlthe remam ng-half bythe tndian iii4imry. He further Stated that, by agreement with the East Indib Company last year, one-half Of hE eoxtriordinary expenses of the last China war, amounting to
90,00o., was payable by the Government to the Company, by whom, however, a lazger sum was due to the Govemment.
After certain inquiries had been answered by the Government, followed by a5short discursion. respect.
ing theo forth coming Bud get, the oouso resolved itself into a Committee o Supply, when a supply was ordered to be granted to liEn MAjxsrr.
TheCHAmm-cLorS of the EXCHEQUER moved for the appointment of a select committee to inquire into the operation of the Bank Act of 1844, and of the Bank Acts for Ireland and Scotland of 1845; ale into the law relating to joint-stock banks. In order to eltucidate the operation and policy of the act of 1844 he went back to the tine of the Bank restriction,ando.?thewholesomeprincple adoptedby SirRoBiETPEEL in 1819,-the convertibility of banknotes into gold. Acting upon the report of a comnittee of that House, Sir ROBERT, in 1844, introduced the act in question, with the view of further enforcing that principle, by imposing certain conditions upon the iEsue of banknotes, and providing securities a4,ainst their over-ssue,-a policy whi-a he (Sir G. TEwrs) thought it auperfluous to u'stify. The issue of notes by the Bank of England beyond the limit of 14,GU0,0001. on securities was regulated by their reserve of bullion, and the effect of the act of 1844 had been to increase the amount of gold in the coffers of theBank. Another change introduced by that act was the separation of the issue and the banking departments, which afforded a security to the creditors of the Bank. Referring to the crisis of 1847, to the trials to whichi!e act of 1844 had been subjected, owing to the abnormal state of things occasioned by the war, which led to a large exportation of bullion; to the changes in the monetary systems of certain continental countries; and to the extraordinary drain of silver to China, lhe thought that as, notwithstauding all these disturbing causes, the currency of this country had remained in a sound state, and the credit of the Bank had never been questioned for a moment, it did not arrnar expedient that any material alteration should be made in the act of 1844. l:e then noticed some of the points of detail vhich would come under the conaideration of the committee. One of these points was the precise limit of the issue of notes, some desiring tat the limit should be extended about 1,600,0001., upon the presumption that the paper circulation would thereby be enlarged to that amount. But his opinion was that the alteration would not have that result, and that it would only lead the Bank to reduce to that extent their reserve of gold. At the same time, he admitted this was a subject fairly within the consideration of the committee. Another question was whether, assuming that there should be a legislative limit to the Bank's issue of paper, a power should be vested in the Government to enable the Bank-, under special circumstances, to depart from the restriction. He was, however, entirely hostile to iuch a proposal. He adverted briefly to other minor points and to the laws respecting the Irish and Scotch banks and joint-stock banks, observing that the manner in wbich the latter were wound up was anything but satisfactory; at the same time, he dissented from the suggestion that they should be placed under the supervision of a Government officer.
DJr. DISRAEUL thought there should be two committees. He was at a loss to understand, he said, what were to be the labours of the proposed committee, since the Government seemed to have made up their minds upon the subject. He thought it would have been better if the CRA;cELraon of the Exouytquzp had at once brought in a bill.
After some observations by Mr. TiTE and Mr.
BAILLIE,
Air. GLYN, concurring with Mr. DISRAELI in opinion that there should be two committees, observed that the question of convertibility was distinct from the machinery and mode in which that principle was carried out; and he objected. among other things, to the limitation by the act of 1844 of the issue of notes to 14,000,0001., for which fixed sum the CHAwcELLon of the ExcniLnQILTX had assigned no reason. The general principle was, not to allow the amount of notes issued on securities to be fixed but to make all issued above that amount tear a fixed rate of interest, according to the bullion in the Bank, which ought to regulate the rate of interest.
Mr. HmzuEY strongly urged the division of the inquiry between two committees.
J$r. MALNsS entered into many details to show that nothing could be more unsatisfactory than the working of the act of 1844; that there had been no deficiency of gold, and that whlat the country wanted was not gold, but banknotes, the issue of which, in spite of the exigencies of trade, was stopped by the act, while the Bank had locked up in its coffers a supply of gold sufficient to meet demands, making money unnecssarily dear.
hIr. HREADLAM objected to mixing up with matters concerning the Bank Charter the law of joilntstock banks, the present state of which was disgraceful and required immediate alteration.
Mr. LAmo observed that Mr. 1LiNs, though ostensibly maintaining the principle of convertibility, advocated a relaxation of the Bank restriction and an issue of notes that would infallibly exhaust the stock of bullion. The only safe mode of adjusting the supply of money to the demand was by the rate of interest, a rise in the rate at once diminishing the demand and increasing the supply. Agreeing in the main with the CHAxcELNOR of the Exc=qusn, he mentioned certain points in respect to which they differed, and which, in his opinion, were fit for inquiry. It was the iuterest of the public that there should be a large and efficient reserve; but the interest of the Bank lay the other way. He thought, hovever, that some arrangements might be made between the Bank and the Government upon this point.
Mr. J. MAcGrtGon found fault with the working of the act of 1844, which was approved by AIr. POLLARD-UIJBQIART.
Mr. NEWDEOATE considered the objection to an absolute limuit of the iqsue of notes unanswerable. He pointed out what he considered a vice in the act of 1844, that, while it restricted the action of the Bank when the amount of bullion was small, there was no restriction upon its use when large, which induced the Bank to stimulate speculation.
Sir C. WOOD, in reviewing the objections to the act of 1844, observed that it was never supposed that that act would remedy speculation and all the evils connected with the circulation; its object was as far as possible to regulate the circulation, and to secure the convertibility of banknotes. The amount of 14,000,0001. to be issued oa securities was fixed because that was the minionimn of notes retained in the hands of the public. He denied that the crisis of 1847 was in any way caused by the act of 1844, the rules of which were, in his opSnion, the best for their purpose, and the least stringent, that could be laid down. With respect to the latter part of the motion, he thought there was a great deal of force in the objection to referring the subject of the jointstock banks to the samne commoittee, and if the House should be of that opinion the Cu.&Acm.r,o
of the E.xcaQEQLs would not insist UpOnl that part of his motion.
Mr. SpOoNEB insisted that the contrac t of 1819, by which it had been said Parliament should be bound, was an unjust ontract, which deranged bargains made in a depreciated currency, and whlih never had been acted up to, and never could be. He believed, if the act of 1819 had never passed, that the currency would have been restored before this time, without the evils occasionred by that law. He enlarged upon whht he held to be the evis of that law and the act of 1844, and declared that in his opinion a plan might be devised which would secure the converti-
bilityof notes without the alternations ad mischiefa eausedby the existing law.
lIr. WiaxsNsoN defended the act of 1814, the sole complaint against wichb, lie said, waa that it was Supposed. erroneously, to raise the rate Of interest.
Mr. MUNTz thoughit that after the deelarations of the CrreAERLoi of the ExciHEquEihe appointment of a conAirttee *as a mere sham.
3 Mr. THLDvAED urged tha t care should be taken that the conniittee on a subject so important was a fair 0ns, or its opinion wouvd go but a little Way with tthe House or the couitry.
- Mr. INR, Mr. 4IrXALEXAIDER HASTIE, and Mr. CnOStr., y nl dee a few remarks, and Mr. CntrLEY enteiseh tomewhat fully into various po intswhic h h e thought demanded inuquiry.
The ORA'rcELuonoof the EXCHEQUER, in his replY,
iConsented to witdraw the latter part of the motion relating to the lWr of joint-stock banks, and in this .amended form the motion was agreed to.
In a committee of the whole Houze,
Er. LLowE roved for leave to bring in a bill for the abolition of passing tolls, explaining briefly the nature of these tolls, an(d the manner in wfhich the Government proposed to deal with the harbours to which they were paid, and to provide for the dis,charge of debts.
After a discussion, in which Mr. DBXDEs Mr. IRcz, Mr. VA2xcE, Mr. M'CAxN, Mr. W. S. iNL1tsAY, Mr. JAStEs MAcGREGoR, Lord GALWAY, and other members took part, the motion was agreed 'to, and leave was obtained to introduce the bill.
Some further business was disposed of, and the House adjourned at five minutes to 12 o'clock until IX4onday.

Everybody old enough knows what it is to see
Everybody old enough knows what it is to see -or do the last act of a long and momentous affair; -the last note, the last bill, the last signature, or -the last leavetaking. "' I have just closed a trans" action which began in 1535," we have heard a vanon say. That was a matter of fines and rents, -and might draoggle on for centuries longer without -doing much'harm. But here we have before us -the last document, we hope and trust, of the Russian war, and as brief as a last word ought to be. It is the protocol signed at Paris on the 6th u11t. for carrying out the provisions of the Treaty -of Paris, prefaced with a letter from Lord CowLnY, -and illustrated with facsimiles of the tro maps, paTIhed (this time) by the representatives of the six Powoers. Nothing can be shorter or clearer. 'The boundary line is carried completely clear of all those extraordinary lakes that line the west coast of the Black Sea for 60 miles or so from the mouth -of the Danube. It is carried quite round that Bourna SolaLakewhich at one time thelRussians proTosed to cut in two. Keeping at a respectful distance from the heads of Lake Ali Bei, Sasik, Kitai, and Katlabug, it approaches at last the now famous Yalpuck, at the head of which stands that 2nysterious duality, the two Bolgrads. In order to remove all further misconception on this point, the line passes northward of both, leaving them in Moldavia. As Russia, however, still wanted, or professed to want, a capital town for that portion of Bessarabia, and also some equivalent for the -territory lost by this alteration, the line, now hturning northward, has been slightly deflected -westward, a good way up the river. This gives Russia the town of Komrat, on the river Yalpuck, about fifty miles from the lalke of that name. -The map, however, which now seems to remove -all fear of a Russian port on the Danube, makes it equally evident that Bo]grad would have been such a port. We see, then, what we have escaped from. The other map merely gives the Delta of the Danube to Turkey, instead of Moldavia, and with the Delta gives the little Isle of Serpents, -lying out some way in the Euxine. Nothing can be more beyond doubt or sharp practice. True to our national character, we have not been quite so well informed as we might have been ;- -we have blundered, we have been imposed upon, 'but we are at last vigorously, obstinately, and mnathematically right. Bolgrad is now a household word. Village politicians are familiar with the Val de Trajan and the Akermann-road. The facsimiles of the maps, with the signatures of the 'Plenipotentiaries, manu propria, are in all the shop vindows, and ere this at least a hundred thousand -of our fellow-citizens have spent a good five nainutes in the vain attempt to read " WALWSKl" in the wonderful scrawl that comes third in the list. How well England would do everything if it -only had a little more time to prepare, or, at least, 'knoe exactly what was to be done !
Butt the PRE,&iEygs own account of the affair surpasses the protocol and annexes themselves in succinctness, simplicity, and graplic effect. Per-fectly goodnatured, and almost neutral in its tone, -there is hardly a word in it that Baron Br.Uxow -himself could except to. Every step is disposed of in a few strokes of the pencil. The exclusion from the Danube, reluctantly accorded by Russia -to the mediation of Austria; the Congress on this 'basis; the appeal to the kiindness of the Congress -to grant a market town to the Bessarabian farmers; its hasty consent; the Russian map that " we could none of us understand;" the other map, in which Bolgrad was an inoffensive little place five or six miles up the river ; the disgust of the Commissioners when they found themselves at a regular port on Lake Yalpuck, and were told " This is Bolgrad," with the very natural result that the allies wouldn't stand this, and made Russia agree to a Bolgrad in the sense of the treaty and the original Convention ;-all these points are touched off with a brevity and lurking hunmour that the prince of our caricaturists might envy. It is a style in shortband. What a long affair-nearly a tvelvemonth's work-is comprehended in those few lines ! It is quite a lesson, not merely to storytellers, precis-writers, or -abridgment-makers, but to everybody. A word -to the young. Whatever you read, whatever you see, or hear, or do, at the earliest opportunity reduce it, be it much or little, to a few simple ideas, a short sketch, not longer than an epitaph, -that it may be clearly impressed on the memory, without being a burden or taking too much room. It is not very easy. Mlost people run on, the instant they are set on a subject, if they are at all personally interested. They plunge into circumstances, lose their heads, aud fling masses of -description, narrative, whole documents, dialogues,-in a word, the whole thing over again, at -their hearers. The great art is to extract the essence of a story, and perfume it with a little -sentiment-good nature, if nothing else. It wiU -take its place in your memory, be always at hand, and be producible, as well as welcome. Such a Atyle must be formed on conversation-indeed, what good style is not ? Our PRBmia r has it, .and it is the spell by which he holds power. A collection of such historiettes as that we have before us might easily be made from his :speeches, and would almost make what we wanta histoly of England to the present time.
No doubt such a power, with the kindred knack -of getting out of scrapes, may be used for ill as for good. It is better not to get into scrapes at aD]; and it is better not to have long, confused, -troublesome matters to be simplified. Somebody -ought to have known all abouit the two Bolgrads. &iomebody ought to have kept his eye on the Isle -of Serpents and the Delta of the Danube. We 4ought not to have alloweed the Chinese to persevere in an iufraction of the treaty, which could only eiid in a collision. We might have -spared ourselves that expedition to the Persian Gulf, which, if ever so successful, will proUbably cost us more lives and money than it will Persia, and leave things much as it found them. We don't always get well out of scrapes, as even lord PALIMERSTON himself must feel. When we fail to do so, when the sequel is a disaster, or when the balance of good and ill result is so even that ve do not like to think much about it, that is the -time to pass an honest judgment on our part in the quarrel. Succes has glossed many a cause ere now ; a4d in thp niultitude of quarrels we have had
with all the nations of the earth it is not reasonable to suppose that we have always been in the right, or that we could not but go to war. Yet Lord PitDmxRaSox would certainly seduce us into the belief -that we are not only the bravest, the strongest, the richest people in the world, but also remarkably fair, content, and peaceable. In these days we do not destroy a fleet, and then call it an
l untowa.rd event;" but whenever the mail brings
the intelligence that we have destroyed * fleet, or taken a town, we fall to mutual congratulations. Ships, men, and money are forthcoming; the perpetrators themselves, possibly afflicted with misgivings, are astonished to find what a good case the P?xnmnR can make for them, and eventually we get out of the scrape with a treaty, an addition to our territory, and possibly also to the national or the Indian debt. The mass of the nation has nothing to do but to reap the glory and to pay the bill, and even Government itself has occasionally to take up a war it would never have commenced. Some check there ought to be to a game which may go on too long, and at all events is getting beyond the public control. Some day we may find it necessary to take the backward step of confessing our error anxd making amends, but we would rather relinquish a good deal of our right than have to do so.

The French people, though more communicative
The French people, though more communicative than ourselves, are not to be understood in a day. Their society is not so complicated as ours, their laws are more simple and logical, their political institutions, so far as they remain, are more theoretically exact; it is usual, therefore, to think that though England, with its venerable usages, its contradictions and its paradoxes, requires a long study, a single glance is enough to gain a conception of the simple structiure of France. We are apt to believe that the country is what Paris makes it, and that Paris always takes its tone from the ruling power of the mnoment. But France is something, more than a mechanism of which an individual, under the name of Emperor, King, or President, pulls the moving strings. Civilized human nature will have its play, and political discussion is one of the favourite exercises of such minds as France produces in multitudes. It cannot be wondered at, then, if, from time to time, we hear something to remind us of days that have passed away, of a Monarchy now in exile and a tribune now dumb. True, the vast body of society cares for none of these things. Paris to the stranger, or even to the ordinary resident, seems wholly absorbed in material cares. Never were the names of liberty, public spirit, public purity, less regarded. One faction rails at them under the pretence that they are hostile to faith, and we hear of the " virus" of free institutions and the " ulcer" of Parliamentary government. Another class merely ridicules the memory of all that France was for more than 30 years. The Bourse is open; what matter if the Chambers be shut? Men eat and drink and amuse themselves very well, without the liberty which the old gentlemen of the Revolution talked about, and without the responsible government, which only gave- a few pedantic men of letters an opportunity of display. These opinions, lhowever, though apparently held by the great majority of modern Frenchmen, are not universal. There are still some who feel that in free speech, in a free press, and in representative government France had treasures not lightly to be thrown away. Few in number, banished from public employment, destitute of the wealth which is the one thing honoured in modern France, a band of intellectual men keep alive the traditions of former days. As half an hour's walk will take one from the gayest quarter of Paris, where the occupation of every man is to amuse or to be amused, to the precincts of the University, where, in the midst of a populous capital, he will find students working as they seldom work elsewhere, so we may turn from the France of gain and display, of the Credit Mobilier and fine equipages, to the France which still lives in the conversation and writings of a few eminent men.
The Academy has just received a member whose name has become classic even in his lifetime. M. BioT belongs to the great age of the Revolution and the First Empire, which, whatever may have been its literary claims, undoubtedly produced the most brilliant constellation of scientific men which France has ever known. Fifty-three years have elapsed since M. BIOT read his first essay in the presenee of the FiJST CoNSrU of the Republic, and now, in the evening of his days, he comes to receive the crowning honour of a seat in the Assembly to which every French celebrity aspires. According to usage, he pronounced an eulogium on hiis predecessor, M. DE LACRETELLE, and the duty of responding fell to the lot of M. GtIzoT. It is the address of this statesman which we think worthy of notice as an instance of the feelings which prevail among the most highly educated men in France, and the caution with which it is necessary to express them. There has been lately not a little of such writing and speaking. One author has published a work, in which lhe praises England to a degree which must make those who remember his Legitimist and Catholic prepossessions doubt his sincerity; but every compliment to our heretical and semi-democratic race is so worded as to be a wound to the existing power in his own land. Another, wiser and more thoughtful, takes as a subject the old Monarchy and its fall, and from these draws practical lessons for the present day. Even ancient history is made to furnish materials for cutting taunts. A writer of reputation discusses the monuments of ancient Rome only to tll us with what rapidity and bad taste NERO pulled down and rebuilt large portions of the city, and to point out that at the time of her deepest degradation Rome could boast of victories over the barbarians. M. GUIZOT is more moderate, not to say more cautious than these. lHe was the head of the Government which the Revolution of February overthrew. He was the chief opponent of the theories which the victorious Republicans wisbed to substitute for the principles of political economy. He may therefore consider himself as too closely connected with the history of the time to have the full liberty of censure. The answer to any impatient expressions might be, that he and his colleagues had really been the destroyers of the liberty which it was now too late to deplore. But in calm and sorrowful language, the speaker sufficiently indicates his regrets and his fears.
These Academical addresses would not be much to the taste of the English people. We have the old notion that the use of eloquence is to persuade, and that where no result is to follow the speaker seldom rises to anything better than mediocrity. Funeral orations and coinplimentary addresses have therefore never flourished among us. The greater part of M. GuizoV's speech is taken up with the merits of M. BioT, and differs in nothing from the panegyries which are common on such occasions. But towards the end the speaker leaves the subject of personal achievements. He considers M; DE LACRETELIE and M. BIOT in their relation to their country and its society. The former, he says, enjoyed in his old age the esteem and sympathy of the literary world from which he had retired. The Academy interested itself in him, took pleasure in hearing of him, and in receiving the communications which he addressed to it. The same feeling, he indicates, extends to M. BIoT. Happy, then, are the men who receive the honour and esteem of an intellectual body, for its intellect is aU that remains to France. "IJt is now," says M. GUIZOT, "the
(general incliatipn to see niowhere anything but " deceived hopes, disenchantiments, and disap" pointiments, and indeed all that We have seen and
"undergone is calculated to give us this sad notion " of human destiny. Where we counted on strength CCwe have found weakness; a premature decline or " a sudden fall has been the lot of that which " promised us a long future. The greatest war.oQra
"have' been conquered, the wisst policies have "failed, the most noble institutions have falen. "We have lived in the midat of ruins,, He goes on to say that intellectual greatnews has alone remained amid this universal destruction,-" a "clear indication of the means by which we can "always promise ourselves a little security and "xolid succeas."
In these mournful phrases it is impossible not to see the blighted hopes of an ardent spirit. M. GUIZOT has reached the allotted term of life only to find the institutions he valued destroyed, the principles on which he founded his policy denied, and the great body of his countrymen indifferent to what he had taught them to consider as the highest national good. The historian of civilization in France must deplore that this is the end of all the changes through which his countrymen have passed. His eyes must close when all which in his opinion a thousand years had been preparing has been, for a time at least, swept away. We can well imagine, from the tone, not unmixed with bitterness, of the old statesman, what are the sentiments of the intellectual and ambitious throughout France-those who feel their power and yet find no path to reputation. To such men the journals and the Legislature formerly gave ample scope. Constitutional government in France was certainly a failure. The Chambers were grossly tainted. There was no mean between official selfishmes3 and factious violence. All that was Ministerial was corrupt; all that was Opposition was venomous and obstructive to a degree which can hardly be understood in this country. The Assembly, under the Republic, was but an exaggeration of the worst faults of the Chamber of Deputies. So representative govcrnment fell. If it had been truly representative, if the heart of the country had been with it, if it had embodied anything but a political theory, things might have been different; but, as it was, it perished amid the indifference, if not with the approval of France. Yet none can forget the long list of great names which made these unfortumate Legislatures illustrious. In its brief term of free government France rivalled the oratorical reputation of the classic land of liberty. GUIZOT, TuIxuS, 3oiA, BERRY=n, IMAtTINE, MONTALEKABERT were names familiar to every ear. Now their voice is hushed, the Chambers aro no more, the journals are but a name, and if they wish to judge the acts of the Ruler or predict the future of their country, it must be stealthily and by inuendo, in some historical treatise or some Academical oration such as M, GUIZOT lately pronounced. Strange it is that a nation so full of genius, of curiosity, and of oratorical power as the French should apparently acquiesce in the proscription of their language as employed in its noblest form and for its highest objects.

The magnitude and urgency of the question
The magnitude and urgency of the question touching our supplies of cotton may be inferred pretty plainly from the fact that, even among the exciting topics of an Address, the subject emerged successively to the surface on the first two nights of the session. Few indeed are the questions wlhich concern us mzore vitally. At the bottom of our power and prosperity lies our manufacturing industry, and how vast a proportion of this industry is fed with cotton we need not stop to explain. More than half of the entire exports of the united kingdom was despatched last year from the port of Liverpool, and of this total a very large amount consisted of manufactured cotton. The whole consumption of the country is at the rate of 43,000 bales a-week-more than 2,250,000 bales a-year. Nor is there any likelihood of a decline in this respect, except from a failure in the raw material. The demand is both a wholesome and a natural one, created by the spread of civilization and the extension of navigation and commerce. Its steadiness only implies that milDions upon millions appreciate the most con. venient description of raiment, while an increase in its rate means that millions more are learning the same lesson. There is nothing factitious about the matter, marvellous as it is. In the necessities of
life clothing comes next to food, and this clothing i it is our vocation to furnish to the world. We possess coal, iron, labour, sldll,-aU the energy. required for toil, and aU the science required to make that toil effective. We want from others nothing but the material to work with, and the simple question is, how to insure a supply on which such enormous interests depend.
Stating the facts broadly, we actually use more than half the world's produce of cotton, and could use a good deal more. Of this produce five-sixths are raised in America alone, nor is there any doubt that America wil always grow as much cotton as it can, and always supply as much as it can to its best customers. But the productiveness of America, as Americans themselves confess, is limited, and, moreover, its own manufacturers make their demands upon the crop. Inasmuch, therefore, as cotton can undoubtedly be grown in many other countries, and, what is still more to the purpose, in many dependencies of our own, it becomes of extreme importance to take up in good time a matter at once so important and so practicable. It is all very well to reflect, as we can with entire complacency, on the fact that we support without exhaustion whatever taxes may be required for the public service, but this strength itself arises from successful and remunerative industry, while the chief aliment of this industry is contained in the wool of the cotton plant.
At the annual meeting, the other day, of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce the subject, of course, received the prominence which might have been anticipated, and one of the members of the Chamber enlarged to some extent upon the resources furnished in this respect by our colony of Demerara. The facts alleged were exceedingly pertinent and strdiing. In Demerara there are, he said, no fewer than 400 cotton estates thrown out of cultivation and abandoned. These estates, if in good work, would of themselves yield 150,000 bales of cotton a-year, while the virgin land of the colony, yet untilled, and adapted to the growth of this precious material, is suffcient in extent to furnish our entire supply. Such was the purport of the communication-a communication made by a gentleman who had spent a considerable part of his life in the colony in question. Why, then, is the cotton not produced, and why, when the article is so sure of a sale inBritish markets, is it not raised and exported by British colonists 5 The answer to this query involves a very serious topic.
The truth is this -Cotton is not grown in Demorara as it might be, because there is no labour procurable; and labour is not procurable, because slavery has been abolished, because there is no incentive to toil operating on the native population, and because great impedimenta have. been opposed to the importation of free labourers. The first of these points requires no comment: slavery has been destroyed, and it is not a thing to be revived again. The econd and third will be better comprehended after a little explanation. In our own country, as in most countries of Europe,
labour is an obligation imposed upon tho gret. mass of mankind by the very conditions of their daily life. Food, clothing, fuel, and shelter are naturs'S own requisitions; after these come the calls of the taxgatherer, and it is as much as. unskilled industry can do to meet the aggregate demand by sturdy and unceasing toil. But in the tropics these conditions almost vanish. What withthe nature of the climate, the fertility ot the boil,
and the habits of the black, most of the neceswlties of negro life can be obtained through a large portion of the year with little or no exertion. The apparel of the dark-akinned race, when not selected as an expression of vanity, is scanty inthe extreme, and the rest of their wauts can be satisfied without anymore trouble than is involved in squatting upon some corner of an abandoned estate. The result is ho more than natural. Where subsistence is easilY compatible with vagrancy and sloth, there is little inducement to labour, and little labour to be obtained.
But whv not import free labourers ? or why, at any rate, object to their importation ? Even if they did no good, and followed the example of the native blacks, that could hurt nobody but those who invited them, and who might be left to take care of their own interests. Here, also, there are special considerations involved. By a supply of labour is meant, in the eyes of the planters, such an aggregation of labourers as shall render work, practically speaking, a matter of compulsion. Either free labourers must be inported in such numbers as to asnnimlate the conditions of daily existence to those prevailing among ourselves, or they must be landed 'on such terms as would invest the employers of labour with the power of- exacting it in full measure. Now, to these terms the philauthropists who had been most active in procuring the suppression of slavery entertained strong objeci tions. They held that any arrangements commu-
nicating such a character to the labour-market would be equivalent to the re-introduction of slavery in disguise; so the end of it was that labour was not forthcoming, that the Demerara estates were not cultivated, and that no cotton is sent from those parts to England.
But these arguments only place in a stronger light than ever the value of the cotton fields of India. There, at any rate, we escape all the embarrassments of the labour question; forthere, owing to the peculiar character and density of the population, labourers can be procured in any numbers without any talk of slavery. The aspect of this matter at present is very far from satisfactory. When Mr. VxxoNw SuriT claimed for Government, as he did on Tuesday and Wednesday last, the credit of sympathizing with those who desired to promote the cultivation of cotton in India, his allegations were doubtless well founded, for it is absurd to suppose that any Administration could be blind to the true bearings of such a question. But the actual progress of the work is not what it should have been, considering how long its importance has been acknowledged. Very possibly Sea Island cotton may not thrive well in the Deccan, but that cotton of very good quality can be produced there, and to an unbounded extent, is beyond a doubt. Mr.VEnxoN Sxnr acknowledged, too, that the article produced was capable of considerable improvement by the expenditure of greaterpains upontheproduction. Why, then, should not so good a work be carried vigorously forward? The committee which sat nine years ago to consider this question reported that the great obstacle consisted in the defect of communications, and the absence of proper faeilities in the way of transport. This obstacle, however, is now in a fair way of disappearing, and there can be no reason why India and England should not be speedily brought into a new connexion of infinite advantage to both countries alike.

The screw LVeanPship me, Moodie coImvnn:er from New York on the 25th, has arrived with advices to the 2th ult. and $263,319 in specie on freight. TheUnited Stats'mailsteamshipAtlantic, hence, arrived at New York on the 23d ult. The advices are entirely devoid of general interest.
In the New York market money was easy with rates in favour of the borrower on good security, being 8 to 8i per cent. for prime 60 to 90 days' bills, S to 9 for four and si months' bills, and 9 to 10 for longer dates; and good single names secondclass paper, not exceeding four months, passed readily at about 12 per cent.
In exchange nothing done.
Cotton had maintained a hardening tendency although freights had advanced, and the receiptJ at the ports continued large and had advanced one quarter of a cent. The America and the Atlantic's advices were caleulated to sustain the buoyancy of the market for a period. In State and Western flour, compared with the previous Tuesday, a decline of five cents had taken place, but the business had beer. light.
The snowhaving prevented arrivals, Canada flour, with light stocks, had advanced five to ten cents; Southern flour in favour of the buyers. The stock in store large for the season.
Rye flour in firm request at full prices. Corn meal without important change. Prime wheat, in consequence of the ice, about two cents better, but the business was restricted, from it being impossible to execute foreign orders. Rye, in reduced supply, held at one dollar without sales. Cotton dull, and stocks inaccessible. Oats about one cent better, with a good demand. Pork unchanged. Beef in increased demand, and an advance of 25 to 50 cents had been obtained for most kinds, the supply being moderate and receipts trifling. Prime mess in good request and firm. Beef hams in small supPly, and well held, but meats better, with a good demand. Bacon firm, with a good demand. Dressed hogs more plenty, and declined threeeighths per cent., with a brisk business.

In the Senate, upon the bill granting aid to the Atlantic Telegraph Company having been taklen ur, MIr. Pugh moved as a proviso that no money should be paid under the authority of the act until a convention should have been concluded between the United States and Britain, whereby such portions of the British possesions in North America as coma mand the western terminus of the telegraph should have been subjected to the principle cf neutralization as adopted in the Central American treaty of 1850. He said he would not vote a cent until the safety and the lives of the people of the United States, perilled by the exclusive use of the line by the British Government in war time, were secured. Er. Benjamin rebtuked Mr. Pugh, and asked if the matter was of such importance to Great Britain? Was it not extraordinary that she proposed to them a full and equal participation in the control and benefit of the line, and consented to allow their Government and citizens equal privileges with herself and citizens for the mere sum named? He said, if they rejected the offer they would never have such an opportunity again; and he advised the senators not always to be thinking of war, but to use all means for preserving peace. Ultimately the bill was passed.

DUBLIN, FnIDAy MOIurnZG.
The election for the county of Limerick is fixed by the High Sheriff for Tuesday, the 17th of February. The local papers state that Mr. MIonsell will merely have to go through the formal ceremony of a reelection, as no onc dreams of any opposition being given to the return of the right hon. gentleman.
DEATE OF ARCHDISEOP SLATTERY.
Another Irish niche is at the disposal of the Holy See by the death of Dr. Slattery, titiilar Archbishop of Cashel. The most rev. prelate expired, after a long illness, yesterday morning at Thurles. The deceased was a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin, and until rather recently was believed to have entertained advanced view3 upon the education question. At all events it is pretty, certain that until the arrival in Ireland of Dr. Cullen he showed no symptoms of hostility towards the Queen's Colleges. and it was only when the project of foumding a Catholic university was first broached that Dr. Slattery, with others, took his stand with the Ultramontane party in the Roman Church. The Freenman's Journal, in its obituary notice, says:_
"' The venerable prelate bad almost reached the patriarchal age of 80 years; and his declining health had for some time back filled his numerous friends with the apprehension thit his dissolution was near at hand. His Grace was Brofcnsor of Logic in Carlow College previous to his obtaining a parish in the archdiocess of Cashel in 1815. Ho was subs - quently removed from the nissionary duties of a pari h priest to the more arduous and important ones of PresideLt of Maynooth College, in which erce he succeodea the la a M%os Rev. Dr. Croly, and continued until ha was raised 'o the dignity of the mitre. His grace was consecrated Arczbishop of Cashel in 1836."1

Lord Cardigan And Major Calthorpe.
LORD UARDIGAN AND MAJOR CALTHOPL.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-In reading over the speech of the Earl of Cardigan in the House of Lords last evening, as reported in the public journals of this day, I feel myself caled upon to take notice of a remark made by him on that occasion. His Lordship states that in a reply received from the author of Leef,crs from llead-Que-ters, he " admitted that two out of three of those allegations were entirely devoid of truthl" This I beg positively and entirely to deny, and it is strange that the Earl of Cardigan in his place in the House of Lords should give vent to Such a "preposterous fabrication." I have before me copies of all the letters I have ever written on this subject, and after carefully looking over them I cannot discover a single sentence that could possibly be tortured into an admission that any statement of mine is " totally and entirely devoid of trutL." That I may have been in error in certain instances I am perfectly ready to admit, and I think anyone who reads my reply to, Lord Cardigan's objections, as given in a notice in the second edition of Letters from Head-Quarters, will acknowledge my willingness to do so. As but few persons have probably seen the second edition it would be doing me a great favour if you wouald insert the following somewhat lengthy extracts from the notice above alluded to:-
" The author has received a paper, drawn up by MajorGeneral the Earl of Cardigan, complaining that ' every one of the Staff Officer's statements with regard to himself are slanderous, and totally rithout any truth or foundationm'
" In answer to so grave a charge the author feels compelled to notice the points alluded to in detail:-
"1L His Lordship asserts that during the patrol in the Dobrudscha (vol i, p. 86), neither men nor horses were unnecessarily harassed, but he does not deny that '90 horses out of 280 returned with sore backs.' This circumstance appears to the author to justify tho assertion that there wv 'very bad management somewhere'-an opinion also held. by several cavalry officers present at tho time.
"2. Lord Cardigan utterly denies that he ordered an officer of the 5th Hussars to release some Russian prisoners whom he had taken with his troop after the battle of the Alms. (Vol. i, p. 184.) This fact was communicated to the author, immediately after its occurrence, by the officer alluded to; but since then a question has arisen la to the origin of the order, which, it would appear from the earl's statement, did not proceed from him.
" 3. His Lordship denies the whole of the statement that Captain Morris, 17th Lancers (voL i, p. 310) advised him to, attack the Russian cavalry in flank during the English heavy cavalry charge at the Battle of Balaklava. He declares it to be 'totally without foundation ; adding, ' that Captain Morris never gave any advice, or made any proposal of the sort;' that ' it was not his duty to do so ;' and that hea ' did not commit such an irregularity.' The conversation however, hu been frequently related by Lieutenant-Colonel Morris, in the presence of several officerg, at various times and places; and the matter, therefore, appears to rest between the Earl of Cardigan and Colonel Morris.
"4. His Lordship considers the account given of the part taken by him in the light cavalry charge (vol. i., p- 317), ' unworthy of any reply, as it is well known' that he, led the Light Brigade up to the Russian cavalry in rear of the battery, and I that the 8th Husars did not advance as far as the battery, but became engaged with the Russian cavalry short of it.' The author could only rely on statements furnished by officers present on the occasion; and as the exseUenceofLordCardigan's horsemasnship is unquestionable, the idea that his horse ran away with him is no doubt erroneous. But it cannot be denied that he retired between the 4th Light Dragoons and 8th Hussars as those regiments were advancing; and it is confidently asserted by the two senior officers of the 8th Hussars who were present, that the latter regiment was not halted until it had gone 300 yards beyond the battery,' when it was wheeled about for the purpose of attacking the enemy's cavalry which had assembled in, its rear.
" 5. His Lordship complains of the version given (voL ii p. 6.) of the report made by the medical board on the state of his health. The author, feeling that the expression made use of was uncalled for, begs to express his regret for havinginserted it, and with pleasure subjoins a true Copy of the report with which he has been furnished by his Lordship:-
" ' Lord Cardigan is much reduced in strength, and the Board, considering the serious character of his complaints. recommend that he may be allowed to proceed to England for the recovery of his health.' "
I leave your readers to judge from the foregoing how far Lord Cardigah was Justified in his asserttons in the House of Lords last night. I wish only further to remark that I should not have troubled you with this long letter had I not been attackec m a place where I was unable to reply.
Ibeg to remain. Sir. sour obedient aerrant.

}AliS THURSDAY, FEB. 5, 6 2'1.
The final decision of the English Government on the occupation of Greece has been received. Orders have been sent to Toulon and Malta to despatch transports to the Piroaus for the purpose of taking on board the Anglo-French troops. It is believed that the evacuation will be effected about the 20th or 25th of the present month, perhaps sooner, if contrary winds do not delay the arrival at the Pirseus of the vessels sent from Toulon. Those from Malta will probably arrive first, but the evacuatioa is intended to take place simultaneously.
The ceremony of the reception of the distinguished savant M. Biot into the French Academy took place this day. M. Biot is the successor of the historian, ML de Lacretelle, recently deceased. As it was known that M. Guizot would pronounce the discourse of reception great interest was attached to it. Indeed, on few occasions has so numerous an assemblage met within the wells of the Academy. Among the audience was a considerable number of foreigners, as well as of French. The ladies mustered strong, and the contrast between the'not very becoming uniform of the Academicians and their rich and ample toilettes was partioularly striking. Long before the arrival of the members of the Academy every place was occupied.
MM. Thiers, Berryer, and Duchatel were seen to converse together very earnestly and amicably for some time. This fact will,1 no doubt, be turned to account by the curioius, and to-morrow or the day after we shall perhaps hear that the "fusion" is now at last complete ! Most of thei Academicians were present. MM. Cousin, Musset, de Lamartine, St. Marc Girardin, were absent from indisposition, and M. Merimee is travelling. Marshals Vaillant and Bosquet also attended the sitting.
When M. Guizot stood up to reply to the speech of M. Biot the utmost silence prevailed. It was interrupted, however, by the general applause which some parts of it drew forth.
M. Guizot commenced by alluding to the first introduction of Al. Biot to the Institute, now 54 years ago, under the distinguished patronage of such men as Laplace, Lagrange, Berthollet, and Monge. "You had, Sir," he continued,
" A singular good fortune at that moment, but from which you derived no personal advantage, and of vhich you have never made any boast. The conqueror of Italy and of Egypt, he who was even then regarded as the future conqueror of Europe, General Bonaparte, then First Consul, attended the sitting of the Academy of Sciences, where you had been summoned to exhibit your -discoveries. M. hIonge was sitting by his side before the Board where you were tracing your diagrams. He aid, with the satisfaction of a father, I This is the produce of our dear Polytechnic School.' 'I see that by the figures,p replied the First ConsuL When the sitting was over the Academy named as its commissioners ICiti. zeus Laplace, Bonaparte, and Lacroix.' I do not know whether the Emperor Napoleon ever recalled that in. cident to his memory, but I know that you never reminded him of it. You respected science too much to seek favours from any one in its name. It was no small honour for tbe mighty genius whom the Academy gave you that day for iudge that he adso sincerely respected science and its masters. One of our most regretted colleagues, h. Mold, told me one day that, in the midst of all his grandeur and the intoxication produced by it, the Emperor Napoleon always remained very sensible to grandeur of mind-the only one to which, when his passions were in repose, he gave his esteem and sympathy. The chiefs of the mathe. matical and physical sciences were for him in his youth the representatives of that original superiosity. The profound and exact nature of their combinations, their conquests over nature, whose secrets and whose power they drew forth, that domination of human thought in the universe had at an early period fascinated the imagination of the hero-despot and won his admiration. Some of these masters of science, and the most iflustrious among them, Monge, Berthollet, and Fourrier, associated themselves, even in the desert, with his fortune, and aided in his glory. He rendered homage to their renown, and he delighted, both in private and in pub. lHc, to testify to them his affectionate respect for their persons as for their labours. But his regard was not, even then, confined to the sphere, exalted as it then was, of the sciences. Prompted by 'those sublime instincts which,' as M. Royer-Collard said at the tomb of Casimir Perrier, ' are the divine portiou of the art of governing,' he keenly felt all the beauty of letters, and he only waited to become the master of France to set forth the grandeur of their influence in the existence of the human soul and of human society. Sensibly affected by the great recollections which the sight of the places he passed through awakened within him, he tried one day, when in the interior of Egypt, to read, with the help of Fourzier, in a pocket Luc-an which he carried with him, the paraUel of Pompey and C,esar ; and as the translation went on slowly and in an embarrassed manner, he cried, 'How happy must Garat and Arnaut be to read with facility these fine lines in the original !' Do not believe,' said Fourrier, ' that they read them more easily than you do.' 'W hat ! said Bonaparte, 'Do people no longer read Latin in France? Oh, I shall take care to see to that.' And, in fact, he did see to it. The sciences had prospered before him and without him, but the restoration of literarv and classical studies was his work. The hmnan creators of the beautiful, Homer and Virgil, Thucydides and Cicero, thanks to him, resumed their rank and their en, pire iD the development of the muind of youth. When he became all-powerful-too powerfulfor his glory as for his fortune- he delighted in the conversation of hM. Fontanes as in that of Laplace. Inthe revival of lettershe sawsigns of that independence which the human mind, evenwhen kept down or yielding to seduction, cannot renounce; and he felt displeasure at it. He censured Tacitus which he had again placed in the hands of the rising generation, and he would not have allowed the Republican sorrows of that same Lutcan who had charmed him on the banks of the Nile to be read in his presence at the Tuileries. It is sometimes the lot of despots, when despots are great men, to create institutions which escape from them, and to see gradually insinuate itself into their system the liberty which had not formed part of their plan. Dominated by instinct and tha taste for all that is great, they evoke a power which is not always given even to them to hold long in bonds. When Cardinal Richelieu founded the French Academy, he little thought that he should soon find it anything but docile to his iU humour against Corneille, and to his bad taste on the subject of the Cid. The Emperor Napoleon had not founded the Academy that it should furnish in favour of liberal principles and sentiments so many intelligent and persevering defenders. How fortunate is the shortsightedness of. these formidable masters of the world, the very grandeur of whose genius makes them sometimes forgetful -of the selfishness of their passions, and who in the impetuosity of their conceptions do more and better than they had ever intended. But, though the Emperor Napoleon had by creating the University only effected what he had meant and desired,-the prosperity of letters, -and had restored to them, as weU as to the sciences, authority in public education, France and the French Academy owed to him on this account a tribute of gratitude. This intimate union of all the great faculties and of all the great branches of human intelligence, that law imposed on sarans as on men of letters to drink iu their youth at the same sources of truth and beauty, that necessary elevation of aU the liberal professions to the same level of intellectual culture, is the tradition of European civilization; it is the honour of French civilization ; and it is the constant desire and care of this Academy. It has chosen you, Sir, in order to prove that, in this redpect also. it hasremained faithful to its sentiments and ft' usages."
M. Guizot then traces the career of the new. Academician, mentions the various scientific inquiries intrusted to hir, the discoveries .he made, the services he in comnmon with other distinguished persons rendered to science, his having been employed with M. Arago inthe arduous undertaking of measuring the arc of the meridian with a view to the unity of measures, the labour and fatigue he endured while in the performance of that duty, and the suecess which crowned it. In the course of his xsnarr,+v he alludes to M. de Lacretelle, whose adiCrAtale histories of the religious wars ix France and- bf the gevolution are so well known, and cofntines thus :
"Tb T ife of I1L de Lacreselle w5s more mixed up with politic's than yours. He took more part than you did in the conflicts of our times, and he did not aetire unuf%e4. Literature, moreover, has closer affinity than science to iho questions which agitate society, and it -,more xcites the human souL Bat, apart from these
divrs accidents of your destinies, still a triking.andnoble resekmblao ex4ts. btween II. de Laetelle tdj ou. He ,lovedlettersaslouhavelovedascience,wthapureand constant
love, and without demanding from themz more than the *delightbof study, andthepossession of truth. He foundin
his literary, asyou have inyour scientific, labours, their
natural Xecormpense-the pace of roul and the trangpi, oys of the dometifq ,hearth within, and respeot P a fame without. He enjoyed these gifts during a lon life, exempt from decline and- he quitted them without seeing them dimlinhed-happy even at the mo. ment when he was about to separate from them. God has visited you with the bitteres trials, but he has given you courage and preserved your power of industry. Within these same walls 'which received you in your youth, you continue, after nore than 50 years, in the same studies, encircled by the colleagues who, whether ancient or modern, feel towards you the same affection and the same respect. Two academies in the Institute were already yours. The Acad6mie Francaise congratulates itself on being the third, and it is happy to recognize between you and your worthy predecessor those fine moralanalogtes which do equal honour to him whom it regrets and him whom it chooses. On two occasions only, at distant dates, and for reasons very diffe. rent, 1i de Lacretelle intervened actively in politics. You have truly traced, Sir, his life and conduct during our first and terrible Revolution, that effervescent source of somany others. Youhave recordedsorietraitsof the youngandconfil dent coarage which he exhibited in the defence of his principles and of his friends, and of his readiness to affix hisname to the strongestdenunciations of their oppressors,andto risk his life in order to save the victims. I have not thought proper to enlarge, after you, on the events of that period; you have said all that was due to the memory of our noble colleage. I feel no pleasure in dwelling, in order to describe them, on those orgies of crime, even where I meet the virtue which protests against them. Thirty-four years later, and on the second occasion which excited the political zeal of M1. de Laoretelle, times had much changed. The French Monarchy had been restored, and with Mfonarchy liberty had returned to France. But Monarcly and liberty alike committed the deplorable fault of believing themselves in imminent danger, and of having recourse for their defence to extreme measures, instead of employing with patience and moderation their rlghts and their matual force. A law was presented to the Chambers for the violent suppression of a press that was violently hostile. The wisest friends of the Constitutional rmgime became alarmed; and they believed it their duty to address to the Crown their respeotful remonstrances,-remonstrances which did not emanate from the political arena, but from the peacefal sanctuary of letters. X. de Lacretelle, who had not refused the functious of dramatic censor in 1827, as in 1792, desired with the same sincerity the safety of the Throne and the maintenance of public liberty, and proposed an unusual but loyal and patriotic step to the French Academy; and the Academy accepted the proposition. The respectful and liberal petition, drawn up by MM. de Chiteaubriand, Villemain, and Lacretelle, was rejected by the Crown. MMIL de Chateaubriand, *Villemain, and Lacretelle were dismimsed from their functions, but the project of law, mortally wounded, did not even arrive at the term of its trial in the Chambers; when it reached the House of Peers the Government withdrew it. This was a fine example of moderation and respect for publio feeling, given by the Government itself, even in the height of its suspicions against Liberty. Happy the Government, and happy the country if both had, on all occasions, known how to stop short in their onward course, and had never carried their conflicts to extremity !"
M. Guizot then enlarged on the merits of M. de Laeretelle as an historian of the Revolution, of the excesses of which he had been the eyewitness; as also to the private virtues which distinguished him. ae concluded as follows:-
"After so many and such excellent labours God granted to M de Lacretelle the sweetest recompense that can be bestowed in this world-an intellectual activity so constant uad so pure. It was allotted to him to exercise that intellect without decay to the term of a very loRg life, in the enjoyment of the noblest affections and the tenderest lomestic cares; surrounded in the country he resided in by the sympathy of all, and receiving from the worid fromwhich he had withdrawn frequent proofs that he was not torgotten by it. The Academy was always pleased to hear his name mentioned, and to receive the literary or affectionate communications which he addressed to it, and to reply to them. I have nothing to add to the picture which You have sketohed of the last hours of an existence so serene knd so happy, so worthy of honour and so honoured; yet [deem it fitting to gather from it a lesson which your modeety has not permitted you to draw. You and AL de Lacre.elle are not only noble examples, but salutary spectacles for ;ur age. The general feeling in our days is to see on all sides )nly hopes baffled, illusions destroyed, and disappointments; aud, in trutb, all that we have seen and experienoed is of a ature to give us a sad notion of social and human destiny. Where we had counted upon strength we have found weakaess. A premature decay or a violent end has overtaken 11 that once promised us a long future. The greatest warriors have been vanquished; the wisest politicians have Failed; the noblest institutions have been overthrown. We bave lived in the midst of rains. But the passionate love Sf science and of truth has not been weakened; the conluests of mind alone have remained durable, and the power )f intellect has alone stood erect -amid fallen greatness. It is h clear indication of the way by which we may always 3e sure of security and of solid sucess. France has more ,han once seen her fortune fail her in her aspirations ;oWards a free Government. Sad, but not disheartened, she sas sought and found for a. space in the strength of her noral activity other sources of gratification and of glory -lfter the political check of the Fronde, the 17th century witnessed the full development of scientific research and ?roduced masterpieces of literature; and in our own himes, when she issued from the revotitionary tempests which made all our liberties an object of suspicion to us, Philosophy, recovering her energy, has disengaged herself From material objects, and literature has once more iirected her aim to the more exalted objects which 3he had forgotten. It is by falling back on the intellectual world that man, wearied with the reverses or the disgrace of the social world, is consoled, strengthened, and exalted. And when the soul is thus tem. pored by the research and contemplation of the true and the beautiful it is then it finds the hope and the force of which it stands in need to undertake once mnore the great designs of humanity. I maybe permitted to invite towards these serene regions of study and of thought the generation which is advancing with an uncertain step, not that it should renounce the practical rights of truth over human society, nor because it despairs of its success, but that it should accustom itself to know it well, and prepare to serve it by accepting beforehand all the conditions of its empire. The Divine Master of Men addressed to his disciples assembled around him on the Mount the words which I will permit myself to repeat to you in concluding, for these words are equally important for the safety of nations as for the salvation of souls :-'But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you."',
The speech of M. Guizot called forth great applause.
Some changes are spoken of among the superior offices of the army, and, also among the higher members of the magistracy. Marshal Canrobert will, it is said, be appointed to the command-inchief of the Imperial Guard, and at the same time to that of the camp of Chalons-sur-Marne; Marshal Pelissier will return to take the supreme commanid in Algeria, and Marshal Bosquet will succeed Marshal Castellano at Lyons.
M. Troplong wil retire from the Presidency of the Court of Cassation; he will be succeeded by M. Delangle, now President of the Imperial Court, who will himself be succeeded by M. Vaiss, Procureur at the same court.
The Queen's Speech is briefly commented on by the Paris journals. The Sicle expresses itself completely satisfied -with this document, and offers the followinlg reflections on its moat important passages:_
*Queen Vlctoria has now repaid to the Emperor of the French the polite expressions he had pronounced in favour of England at the time of his reception of the Persian Ambassador. We remark- with pleasure that the only Power named as the ally of Great Britain is France. The monarchical journals v'ill not share the satisfaction which we derive from this special allusion. The speech of Qaeen Victoria confirms the news which had been erculated with respect to Switzerland, - and the conrtesy 'which England has displayed in asing that the conferences on a mediation shall be held in Paris deserves mention. The passage relating to Naples is not in favour of those who hoped that-the Italian. question had died a natural death. It is impossible to be less explicit on this point than the English Cabinet. We must state, at the risk of being called partisans of England, that we- congratulate ourselves on all that the speech expreeses iith respect to Switzerland, and' aso on the comparative silence which it rmaintaing in regard to Naples,"
The Pays, after remarking on the absence of interest in the speeh, thus examines the position of Lord Palmerston
"The friends of the Premier exprees their c6nfidence in the invulnerable position of the Cabinet, and per,aps this confidence is neot tinged with much exaggeration. The difficulties connected with the execution of, the treaty o f Paris and the &eucb&tet question are settldand itis to be presumed thAt Lore Paluerteni sehishour cosgrailates himelf on this double rsut,hich saves hii iiro M the criti: CiSne of the Chnaervative .

The Dea says
"The speech gives little information to the public, and this wasto have been e.tpected. It is in the' discussions of Parliament that so shill learn the real state of the ies. tions in which England is interested, and in some of w;hich the interests of France are liese bound up."
The following details, from the Pays, relative to the projecteo. railway from the Mediterranean to the 'Euprates have not been 'hitherto published :-The railway will conmmenee on the coast of Syria. The place chosen for the head of the line is near a deep and well-sheltered bay, about two miles from the left bank of the Orontes. A port will be constructed at this spot, which appears to have been designed by nature for such an unde baking. On quittino- the eoast the road will be directed towards lillis a commercial town in Syria, containing about 11,000 inhabitants. From Kilis the railway will be continued to Antioch, on the Orontes, and from Antioch to Aleppo, the chief town of the pashalic of that name. Aleppo is the most importaut town in all Syria in respect to commeree. The inhabitants addressed a petition to the Sultan, praying that the railway might pass near their town, and their request was granted. After passing Aleppo the road will run nearlyparallel with the Euphrates to a place called the Castle of Ja' Ber, situate below Babylon, between }filla and Semaoun, on theEuphrates. Therawill terminate the firstsection of the greattrenl. The linewillafterwards be directed fromJa'Ber toBussorah. It will enter the Persian territory by turning the left bank of' the Persian Gulf as far as Shiraz, will cross Be!oochistan, and reach British India by Hyderabad in the Deccan. Such is the plan of the railway, which will brimg passengers from the coast of Syra to the heart of India without quitting the line-a distance of 4,000miles.
The ealons of-the Hotel de Ville were throwa open last evening to a numerous and very brillianu assemblage, comprising a large sprinkling of the corps diplomatiqe and the lite of Parisian society. The rooms filled rapidly, but, although the orchestra played its most seductive strailS, the dancing did not commence until nearly two hours after the greater part of the oompany had arrived, when the guest of the eveni, the Persian Ambassador, made his appearanc, accompanied by the principal members of his suite. Afterbeingformnllyinfroduced to Baron and Madame Hausmann, Feruk Khaa was conducted through the ballroom to a reserved salon, from which he presently emerged, and went through the principal rooms, with the brilliant and tasteful decoration of which he expressed himself much struck. The dancing commenced immediately after his arrival, and vas carried on with unflagging spirit until an early hour in the morning. That important feature of all balls -the buffet - was supplied w ith that taste and profusion which charao. terize the Hotel de Vile, and the absence of crowding met"the only objection to which municipal fetes are obnoxious. There wrere very few foreigners present.

The first step towards the fulfilment of the engagements taken in the protocol signed at Paris has been made-the Russians have been withdrawn from Serpents' Island. Commander Glyn, R.N., of the Coquette, saw them off. It seems that the pleasure in partingwvas mutual, for the poorcreatures, who had rat for four months and more on that barren rock,'were naturally not less anx;ious to renounce the wretched and unwilling hospitality of the Turks than the British sailors were to return from that most dismal of all stations. In consequence of this withdrawal the cruisers are returning from the Black Sea, and the anchorage at Bujukd6re is more crowded with English menof-war than it has been since the war. Only two ships have left,' the Supply screw steamer, used as a transport for provisions, and the Medina, Captain Spratt, C.B., which left three days ago for Malts. The Medina has been for most of the time in the Black Sea, so that we may be rsure, from Captain Spratt's well-known reputation, that valuable additions and corrections have been made in the Black Sea charts, which will be of great advantage to the navigation of the western coast and of the Danube.
I wrote to you that the Austrians have begun to move in the Principalities. The regiment Grand Duke Constantine had left Bucharest; a telegraph:c despatch, received here two days ago, reports that the regiment bas returned again to Bucharest. As no reasons are stated, this return is probably owing to the bad weather which has set in. This is always the case at this time of year in those parts, but after the transition stage there comes usually a considerable period of settled -winter weather, with frost, during which the roads are in first-rate condition, and the air so bracing that marching would be a pleasure rather than a fatigue.
The concession for a teleg,raph through Egypt and bythe RedSea toIndia has been granted by the Turkish Government to Messrs. Gisborme. The first step taken inthis matter was to ask for a concession for a telegraphlinefrom CapeHelleto Alexandria, touching at Scio and Rhodes. Mr. Lionel Gisborne obtained this concession in the spring of 1855. Taking this concession for a basis the Oriental Telegraph Company was formed, its object being a direct telegraphic communication from England to India by the Red Sea. The East India Company, aware of the importance of a direct telegraph line to India, entered into the project, and promised a liberal support to the company.
Mr. Francis Gisborne came out to obtain the concession for the passage of the line through Egypt and the landing of the cable on its passage across the Red Sea. The great point to gain in the concession was the freedom of the line for through messages and the independence in working it, on both of which points the compan has been successful; for as the line is chiefly caroulated for through messages any power of interference on the part of the Government would necessarily cause delays, and impede the workin-g of the line. Al messages deliverod within the OOttoman empire, or comning from it, will, however, pass through the hands of a Government official.
For the first part of the line, from Cape Helle to Alexandria, the company is to receive a subsidy of 4,5001. a-year from the Turkish Government, which intends to establish in this way a telegraphic communication between Constantinople and Egypt The line from Constantinople to Cape lelle
the Government will keep in its own hand-'. The Pasha of Egypt, -who was asked for the passage of the line through Egypt, gave the concession in a very liberal spirit, and this concession, confirmed by a firman of the Porte, became the basis for the.conoession of the Red Sea line as far as it is witbin the Turkish territory.
The line from Alexandria,to Suez is to pass along the railwvay line, and the Egyptian Govetrnment has offered the use of its own telegraph pQsts, established
along, that line. The ompany is, however, at liberty, if it shoulhdfind it neessary, to erect at its: own expense teleraph posts for its use
- From Suez the liner is.to be a submarine one to,Kurrachee, with the power of lauding the cable i at different points mentioned in the conc'esioo. The first of these stations will be Cosseir, on. -the-
- western coast; from there it Will cross.to Jedd&,' and.go, dow.A to: the Island of Karam an, or some,other ip,inton the.coast o f Yemen, Then it fiv;l.
be land?ed,at Aden< at; as Sharma, the iIiland f
Moseir,andRas.-el-add. With the exeptionof the part beteen this latter place and. Kurrachee,tlhe': length of,the submarinel linewill.nowherp exceed
-600 tatute iles. The points selected for the land-' ing o,f the cable are u a5 to a,ffiord perfect secu-,
_rityfor-the-tations_ At-Cosaeirthere-is-anlEptianm
at Jedda a .Turkish military xtation, and the- other
nts are within the range of influence of the Eas IdiaCom6pany. Relay batteries from Alexandria toKurracheewill make the communication instantaneou. Th'ecompanyisallowed twoyears for the con4tnction from Cape Helle to Alexandria, and threo from the completion of thi line for that -through the 3ed Sea. If the subject istaken np in Eng}and the coinpany hopes to make the whole line within a year.
Now, as there is no longer any doubt about a war with Persia, the telegraph to India, besides its commercial and administrative importance, will have a political importance too, and the delays of the Turkish Government are very much to be regretted, for had it not been for them at least a part of the line would have been in operation now.
As I mentioned in one of my last letters, Mustapha Pasha, the Commander of the Turldki
troops in Upper Albania has sent to Constantinoplo the turbulent chiefs of the frontier distriets towards Montenegro, thus takdng the first step towards the pacifi.ation of that part of the country. Redschid Pasha will now do the remaining part. One of the great reasons which induced the mountaineers of fIortenegro to make razzias on their neighbours was the want of the means of support in their own mountains, and the wish to appropriate some of the produce of the plains. This will De now granted to them in a different way. There is enough land in the plainswhich is not cultivated, and the M1ontenegrnn vwill receive grants of these lands,which they will be allowed to cultivate, paying, like all other cultivators, their tithes and other dues. In this way it is hoped they wil be attracted to the charms of a peaceful occupation, and, having more to lose, they will be rather more cautious about engaging in border warfare. At the same time the Turkish Government intends to make the Vladika a great dignitary of the empire, with good pay-two attractions wvhich will no doubt have their effect, if care be taken that they are not outbidden by somebody else. It is incredible whst effect these allurements produce on the most haughty Albanians, who are de facto just as independent as the Vladika of BMontenegro. If this experiment, which is due to the Grand Vizier's sagacity, had been tried before there can be no doubt that we should never read the name of Mlontenegro in the papers.

VENNA, FM 3.
The leading organs of the German press assure their readers that the Neuchatel question will be settled without any great difficulty or delay, but the Conference-which is to meet at Paris-is likely to have an extremely difficult task to perform. The Emperor Napoleon has recently been endeavourig to persuade his Royal friend and brother in Berlin to meet the Swiss Confederation half way, but His Prussian Majesty is infinitely less tractable now that the Royalist prisoners are at liberEy than he was some three weeks ago. In short, King Frederick William IV. is inclined to insist on many things to which the Swiss neither can nor will agree, and Count Hatzfeldt, the Prussian Minister at Paris, is afflicted with deafness whenever Count Walewski suggests that it would be as well if he could manage to come to an understanding with the representative of Switzerland before the question at issue is taken in hand by the Conference. According to the Becrne Zeitung, the following instructions have been given to Dr. Kern, the Envoy Extraordinary of the Swiss Confederation, and a person who is in a position which enables him to speak positively on the subject tells me that the statement is in substance correct:-" L The SwissGovernment objects to the King of Prussia retaining the title of Prince of Neuchatel, as that canton must in future be to all intents and purposes independent. 2. The claim to the domains is rejected, as they never were the private property of the Prince. 3. The guarantee for the maintenance and protection of the charitable institutions cannot be a foreign one. 4. No separate guarantee can be given that the Royalists shall be as well treated as any other NeuchAtel burghers, as the federal and cantonal constitutions afford a sufficient guarantee." The Prussians, who valne the domains at 3,801,465f., assert that they are the private property of the Prince, but such cannot be the case, for the Duke of Wagrain (Marshal Berthier) had somelien on them, and his descendants stiU receive the interest of a certain capital for which they are said to have been mortgaged. In his " open letter" of July 13, 1850, the King of Prussia (as Prince of Neuchftel) protested againdstthe sale of the domains, but his right to do so was never recognized by the Swiss Confederation. The present policy of Baron Manteuffel is to remain silent, and the extreme reserve of the Berlin Cabinet is'said already to have given offence to the imperial mediator between Prussia and Switzerland.
A Berlin correspondent of the Franzforl Po.t Zeitung writes that Russia is likely to give Europe but little trouble in theWest for some time to come, as she is at present greatly occupied with plans of aggrandizement on the other side of the great wall of China. In St. Petersburg people are beginning to accustom themselves to the idea of a Russian intervention in favour of the ruler of the Celestial Empiz e, " in case the Anglo-French invasion should assume more formidable dimensions, and the rebellion continue to spread." Of course no guarantee can be given for the correctness of the foregoing statement, but it is a positive fact that Russia has, during the last few years, been ". hugging" China very closely as well in the west as in the north. Her movements in Mantchooria (on the Amoor) are known to the whole world, but few people are aware that she obtained possession of Tasikend in 1854, and that her Cossacks in the course of the last year paid the inhabitants of Kokan (or Kokand) a prolonged visit. The Powers have partially frustrated the ambitious plans of Russia in Europe, but they will probably find it much more ditficult to check her progress in Asia. In a letter written a day or two ago mention was made of a map of the Caspian, recently published at St. Petersburg, and we now learn that it is the result of the diligence and skill of a Russian naval officer, Lieutenant Ivatschintsoff, for such is his name, who was employed to take soundings in the Caspian and to survey its eastern and southern coasts, and he is said to have accomplished his mission to the entire satisfaction of the Rursian Government. The area of the Caspian, including its bays and gulfs, is 352,000 square versts. In a kind of introduction to his map the Russian Lieutenant says-" By means of the Caspian and the rivers of Russia the ports of the Baltic are connected with the rich northern provinces of Persia."
The latest public news from Milan is of the 1st inat., and we are assured that all is going on well; but private information has been given me that the ceaseless hurry, bustle, and excitement have produced an unfavourable effect on the health of the Empress. It is stated that theEmpress, who is "proprietor "of a regiment of Hussars which is stationed at Milan, is about to review it on horseback. The King of Bavaria arrived at Milan on the 1st inst. Some time ago Count Paar, the Austrian Charge d'Affaires, was invited by Count Cavour to accompany the King of Sardinia to Nice, but he excused himself, on the plea that he must go to Milan to their Majesties. It is. howev,. stated-
tnat the true. reason why Count Paar declined the invitation was, that no one had been sent by the King to compliment the Emperor on his arrival in the capital of Lombardy. The official correspondent of the Tie7er 7eitung has written to sav that His Majesty is EOwell pleased with the behaviour of the Milanese that his stay in their city is likely to be prolonged until the 15th inst.

PERSIA
The Teheran Gazette, the official organ of the Court of Pers:a, underdate of theo26th of the month of Baby-el-Thany, 1273 (24th of December, 1856), has the following on the capture of Bushire by the English
"From the commincenment of the dispute between Persia and England it never wki the intention of the Government of His Mlalesty the Shah to break off friendly relations with the G abiiet of London; or to excite hostilities against that Power.
"1 The Persian Government has at various times manifested i b good intentions in an official documient. It always
bad tbat4bjeot.ia.iewrone.whbioh.ie- hs-ae b i.ltlhe.f conduct; which, moreover, has been 3hoWn by its acts.
"Iu faet, onthe one hand it gave instructions to its in. o)aador ana full powers to hold interviews with theEnglish Ambassador at Constantinople to settle the dispute in a nmanne'r tonformable -to the dignitfand interests of the two Governments. Considering these intentions, it daily expected to hear that the dispute had been honourably settled between the Ambassadors, and friendly relations restored between the two Governmenta. On the other hand, the Persian Government had issued strict ordersto the frontier authorities not to commence hostilities against the English. For these reasons it had not made the necetsary preparations for the defence of the frontier and of Bunhire.
" There had always been two regiments stationed in gar.
rison at Bushire; that garrison was commanded by the. 8artip Mahomed Ali Khan, who died some time sinee, by the will of God, of a nataral death.
" It was after the death of the commander of the garrison of Bubhire that the commander of the English troops in the Persian Golf, without adhering to the customary fornm of sending the declaration of war to the representatives of the Court of Persia, or at least of maldng the declaration to.his Highness Prince Fehmassib-Mirza, Governor-General of the province of Fars, restricted himself to writing a letter couched in vague terms, which he sent to Bushire and to other ports in its vicinity; this letter was accompanied by a printed sheet on the subject of the declaration of war of the East India Company.
" On the bnorrow of that day the commander in qtestion had aiready landed his troops and seized upon the fortress of Bahmani, which was defended only by a handful of tufenktchi (men armed with guns) of Tenguistan; thence he advanced on Bushire, which he captured without Arilidng a hlow, the Persian troops not having received tho order or the permission of His Majesty the Shah to attack the English troops."

Meeting Of Convocation.
MEBTING OF COVOCATION.
THE UPPER OTTISK
Yesterday morning all the right rev. members of the Upper House reassembled for the disposal of business.
His Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury presided, and there were also present the Bishop of Exeter, the Bishop Of Oxford, the Biuhop of Winchester, the Bishop of London, the Bishop of St, David's, the Bishop of Chichester, the Bishop of Salisbury, the Bishop of Lincoln, the Bishop of Llaudaff, the Bishop of Bath and Wells, and the Bishop of Glocester and Bristol.
The Vicar-General, Dr. Twiss, and the Registrar of the province, llr. F. Hart Dyke, were in attendance.
The proceedings having been opened with the usual prayers,
The Prolocutor [of the Lowerl House and his assessors were introduced, and infonmed his Grace the President that the LowerHouse had anxiouslydeliberated on the questionof a court offinalappealin matters of doctrine, and theybegged to commend to the consideration of their Lordships' House the principles embodied in their report of 1856. The Pro. locutor also read the names of the committee reappointed to confer with the committee of the Upper House on the subject of church-rates.
The Bishop of OXFORD moved that the address of the Lower House with regard to the expediency of continuing and increasing the missionary efforts of the Church both at h me and in Ioreign parts be taken into consideration, and he was saro that in so doing no more important subject could occupy their Lordships' House; for it was more especially with a view to such a subject that they had assembled at the summons of the Queen. He certainly thought it would be becomins that that House made a distinct answer to the message, In discussing the subject of the home missionary efforts the necessity for some increase in the machinery of the Church to aid its present efforts would be apparent to alL There was rising every day aronnd them a tide of ungodliness and unbelief growing and spreading in the Freat cities, in a manner Wch it was fearful for a Chstian mind to contemplate. The increase of the Church's machinery had hardly kept pace, indeed, it had not kept pace, with the increase of the population in this land. He would have preferred listening to the suggestion of some one of his right rev. brethren, but until some better idea was given he would mention that it had been suggested to him that there should be two collections every year in each church as a matter of duty,one for the Church's work out of the diocess, and the other for the Church's work in the diocess. Since the cessation of the Queen's letters his Grace had issued letters, requesting the clergy to collect in their churches as usual, but that step had met with such an amount of opposition in some parts that it became necessary to consider how long those efforts should be continued. The clergy felt much difficulty in making such appeals, espec-ally when it was supposed that the idea of the appeal originated with the clergyman himself. But if the sanction of his Grace and the whole body of Convocation was given to those calls being made twice a-year he was certain that they would be so responded to as materially to aid the Church in the matter of home and foreign missionary efforts. He should therefore suggest humbly that in the answer returned to the Lowcr House a recommendation of thathknd should be msde, if no better idea offered itself to tho approval of their Lordships.
The Bishop of ST. DAVID'S felt indebted to his right rev. brother's suggestion, which he believed would have the effect of improving and extending the present machinery of the Church in a considerable degree, and therefore he was ready to concur with any motion that was made for sending dow n an answver to that effect, and embn:cing such a suggeston. His ouly doubt was. whether that suggestion entirely met the urgency of the case. There were few congregations in the kingdom to which a sermon was not annually preached for at least one or beth of the objects named in the suggestion. He thought thati considering the extreme importance of the whole question, it would be better to refer the matter to the consideraton of a committee, in order that it might have the benefit of more mature deliberation than could possibly be given by their Lordships it present, to the subject.
The Bishop of BXErXER hite agreed with the last speaker that the suggestion of t e Bishop of Oxford, though in itself most admirable, was not sufficient to meet aR the exigencies of the situation. A committee, in his opinion, would be more likely to devise means of more general and wide-spread utility than the measure proposed, but which, he was sure, was only proposed as an aid by his right rev. brother. 11e hoped and believed that whatever recommendation the Convocation at large arrived at it would operate widely among the clergy to induce them to act in the same spirit, and to co-operate to the utmost in.carring out their views. The main point in which he agreed Wit all rig t rev. brethren was, that this question should not be treated in a party spirit, but with an earnest and single wish for the true we are of, that Church over which God had placedl them. The right rev. speaker concluded by moving the resolution for the appointment of a committee, and also requesting the Lower House to appoint a committee on the same subject, which was to confer with that of their Lord. shi from time to time.
The Bishop of WLXCSiTXRR seconded the amendment. Hle apprehended that in appointing a committee of the Upper ouse it would be necessary to name the members at once, but, at the same time, when he considered hov many important dioceses connected with the manufacturing interests of large towns were in the northern province, he confessed that it seemed to him it would be satisfactory, not only to themselves bat to the Church at large, if they could have the advantage of the advice of the bishops and clergy connected with that part of the kingdom. He feared it would scarcely be in order to place their names on the committee, but they might certainly invitethe co-operation of those so well calculated to afford them assistance. He had within his own jurisdiction many populous parishes, in which he could truly say he had laboured to the utmost of his power, in conjunction with others, to introduce additional means of grace, either in the form of places of public worship or in educational schools. Yet he was compeUed to confess, after all, that the population of the parts to which he alluded were in abcout the same state of destitution, particularly as regarded places for public worship, as they were when he endeavoured to introduce additional accommodation among them, and the increase of the metropolitan population was such tbat he saw no prospect of the result being otherwise. The late statistical statements made showed in a most remarkable manner the effect of the attention recently paid to sanitary arrangements in the metropolis. The return of the Registrar-General showed that the increase of population in the metropolis, owing to the greater length of life, was 30,000 annualy, and by immigration 30,000, making;a total increase of 60,000 souls a-year in all. If this was the ca-se-and the authority was too high to admit of its being doubted-it must be obvious how difficult it was to compete with the population2 especially when the individuals by whom th.at population was so increased were almost entirely of the lower order. Ho should cordially agree to the motion, -and think it a most happy day for the ^CrhurOch ilf tfheir deliberations reslted in any practical
The Bishop of LLINDAvF felt the importance of the question most deeply. His own diocess, though not a large one, yet was one in which the population had trebled within the last. 50 years. At the commencement of the
resent century it was 107,000 now it was upwards of 50, 000. And though the whofe diocess had made great tfforts, stiU their means of accommodation were as limited in proportion to the population as ever. There were places in his diocess which now contained more thousands than they did hundreds 50 years ago. One of his clergynbn remembered Cardiff containing 1,5003nhabitants, whereas it now contained 30,000, and frem the local improvements projected there was amost a certainty of its being still further increased, The population of Glaorshire had also grown, n&-had been lednbythcourse of thB TaffYilo traffic to descend from the vicinity of their parish churches which were situated on the hills. In fat, his diocess required both additoqal means for carrying out their existing agencieS and additonal aents also or the aid they alreaay received was inadequate to the emergenc
The BishopLof BAT ndWELrs sad that for telasttwo years he had carried out in his diocess the plan of the two sermons,suggested by the Bishop of Oxford, and with which about two-thirds of the whole of his dicess conplied. The result was that theofunds which were falling for wautof means, were pow much replenished, and they were able to to make large grants'both to the Cdrate' Edana Church Extension Societies. He was also glad-tosay thattho-second year's collection was better and rger than thofistt. He thought that itfit *as once recomeneded by the bench of bishops for a regular custom it would placo -large grants at the-service of the Church Mission.
The Bishop of Lixcoix tbhughtthat the weekly offertory, a practice v!ich obtained in ill Protestant churches in the 'orld except the English, wassin this case well adapted to both manufacturing and agricultural dis-ricts, in which,

ECCLESIASTICA.L SYN'ODS.
The discusson on the motion of the Rev. Canon Seymour on o the subject of synods, was resumed by
The Rev. Canon WOOPDGATE, who rose to propose. an amendment. He said he agred inprinciple with the propositions of Canon Seymour, but he differed from him in the application of that principle. The subject had been aery properly divided into two partsh; fvrt the affirmation of the principleo- and secondly, its application to the present times. o the first he offered no objection, and he sheuld therefore confine his remarks to the latter branch of the subyect. His mahin objection to the motion was that there was no test by which Church membersihip could be satisfac. torwly determined. Reference had been made to the apostolic times, andl also to the precedent of later ages in support of the motion ; but principles which were applicable t
one period were often absolutely inapplicable to another, and especially to the present abnormal conoition of the Church. Every manx except a Romanist was by law a member of the Church, and would therefore beBeligible to become a member of the synod. If it were said that Dissenters would not present themselves, he wouldl refer to what had happened in tho case of vestries where Dissenters had claimed the rightto have a share inthe manage. ament of the affairs of the Church. Mir. Seymour had referred to the Episcopal Church in America, but that Church was not in a state of transition; nor had it to contend with a hostile body whose cry was " Dckndec est Ecdcsi4%,' If there were anything required to confirm his opinion of the daneor to be a prehended fromn the adoption at this monent of the proposa sof Canon Seymour, he would refer the Hduss to the memorial latelv presented to the bobdomada council at Oxford, signed by Lord Shaftesbury' the Bishopof Ripon, and others, requesiteing that those who objected to the thaological examindation should not be compelled to declare themselvesd alnd- ecolesiaA bzglecana heand comhplaineingof the hardship tbat those who did not agree altogen er wNith the doctrine and discipline of the Church should. be ombliged either to make a professior of Disent in claiming the privileges of Dissenters, or forfeitze, or, at least impair, their rights as Churchmen. Thiscshowed the laxity of men's views on the subiect of Church membeahip, and the impossibility of providing at theyprent time any satisfactory test as to what'constituted that membership. At the esmee time he begged to observe that, whatever decision the Housemmight come to, the laity must understand that tone clerhgy of the Church of England were all agreed to aral themseves of their co-operation, leaving the mode of doing so undetermined;and that if there appeared a reluctance cn theirp art to accept that co-operation, it was beciuse they fel t that the times were not the best suited to it, nor did they afford sufficient guarantees that the laymen who would be returned would be bon4 fldc members of the tercho or those whose co-operation would be formtae stateofs thnefit. He therefore begged to move thefollowing nmendment lh

The Ven.tArchdeacon Dtbise , seconded the amenament. He had seen the question brought forward with much regret. both on private and public grounds. First, because he was pained to find himself opposed to one whom he sincerely respected, and, secondly, because he could not help feeling that they who were obliged to oppose the motion were in some sort put before the public in s light of not having Any desire to co-uprate with or recognize the laity. He for one most earnesl and solemnly disclaimed any such feeling. The Rev. Canon Seymour had urged as an argurnent the state of the times in which they were now living. He viewedatbat'argnnieut with some mistrust. It was their busiuess not to regard the times, but to assert the great principles committed to their trst in seraon and out of season, and pehajps even more when tbeywereooutof season. The real question they had to consider was whetlher they could hope to see accomplished that which had hitherto been the object of all their laboour-the rest~oration of the Church to its primaitive principles and condition, or whether they wrere, upon some miere human foundation, to undertake the alteration of those principles to suit a vicious andl abnormal state of things. They coutld not conceal from themselves that they' wore livinig in times when it 'was nmost difficult to force men back upon principles which had been for a timie neglected, or to induce then4 to Iook forward beyond the day in whicli they lived. Mue re uied something to be done at the moment, and were nmtt to be tempted to look forward to the result of their actions, ,which, after all, was the only way to prove the soundness
ofan general principle. it was impossibl ohv a
element not only in Parliament, but also in the preliminary Assembly which was to submit ecclesiastical questionsfoir the uiltimate decision of that Parliament, because in that case they would have the lay element twice represented, which would in effect place in the hands of the laity a real control over the whole state of the established church of England. It was unreasonable to expect that Parliament wrould abdicate its functions and, say thatt, as the question submitted to them had been agres d uponby he cerg an laiy i Conocaionassembled, it onl rmaiedforthm o gveit lgisatvesanction th3t it mghtbecme lw. id ny oe sppoe t atsrliampne, comose a iswasofa vstnumer ~ ersuswho had no regad fo theestalishent,but ho wshedto see it'deatroed,woud hve ny cnsieraionfortheconelusiono

he could not give his assent e P
Mr. ChanceUor lILUtTIN said it was by no means his wisi to stop the discussion, or to disparage the value or dimuinish the effect of the able and lucid speech which they heard last night from the Rev. Canon Seymour; but the proposition was ono of the greatest importance. It was one whici
would completely revolutionize the Hotse. The foundatioa on which they atpresent stood was that of ancient prescription, and it was indispensablo to a title by prescription that it should be invariable. Ho was, therefore, not prepaetd to entertain thae motion, unless they went into the whole question of a new constitution for the representation. of -tle Church of England. W ith a view, thereforo, to afford an opportunity of discussing tbe mntter full and deliberately at a future and more tonvenient period, he begged to move
the revious quostion.
The Rev. W. FE\bAL eoondedthe motion, andsaid ihat
by,the orgn allnotiontheywere tampering with the constitution and imperiUing the rights of the Convocation ; and he eculd not support the amendment of Mr. Woodgatet beckuse it treated tbe question as one merely of expediency7and of time. Re did not think that any tine would - be
expedient.* :
'e PAv.'W. H. Cox thought it was important that
the Housew bholdd arrive at a conclusion on the -eultiect of the original motion. At that moment there was
searcely a majority of the representatives of the pronMnce of Caterhury present; a large boy of curateasfere excluded from all share In the representatione, WIstle the great body of faithful 'laity were equally exclu~ded.
Hle hald had some conversation wvith miembers of theo TIdes,.
of Commons, *ud had ath dt them ho w it was that. Chgr - questions were met wvith such distate in that Hoqoe, The
answer given was that it was not so unich from ignorsin6e ae
. . . }~~~~~~~~-
fr,4~1 an indispo-sitio,n to entertain such questions, theI Hquke bbing aware of the great variety of opinions that pre~&lejd on the subjects of doctrine and discipline, and esp'eci&Uy'among tlio clergy of the Church themselves. ThIey3 desired that any Church queation which came before tbemi should be fortified by a more unanimous opinion and by- t morte EgdeIeral sympathy than that which at present x(sdoutof doors. Th6time was come whenthey shouldlook
tOy eextensnve co-operation and amore cordial sympathy from the people with their proceedings. The conlstitution of tW nvoction was dhfferent from what it v as previous to tof dissolution of whe monasteries. A large body of persons wh o were once members of the body were no lonteoin whence-m e t w st the abbots. It then consisted of 00 or f memboers; it was now composed of only 150 members scarcely b oaoority of whom was then present, so that many of their own members were guilty of contumacy. (A laugh.)
The Rev. Mr. JoYzE suppoited the previous question. e beg edto remind the r ouse that thif this ase body to whim thiey owed the first communion service of 1548r the first Prayer-book of loing 2dfv.ard VI.,the second Praerbook of EdwardYVI., the Articles of 1i63, the Canons of 1608, and that it wvas to this body that they owed the Praaer book as it now stood.
,thse Rev. hlr. Hosx believed the province of Canterbury wstld be precisely where it now stood if they adopted the prdnciple of tr. nseymous proposition. He did not think th oft tere was any previous tsmo in the history of the ineurc when it was more fit tbat the laity should comb!ped with the clergy in considering matters affecting the Chu'rch. The upperclasses weredissatisfied atthe Convocatsil transacting business which intimately concerned them-
etves, wiythout their having an opportunity of expressing their sentir ents upon m it.
The Iev. Canon StiDpORD rejoiced that the subject had been brought forward, because he feared that a feeling exbsted in the minds of the laity that the clergy were esalous of them. Nothing could be more detrimectal to the ainteests of the clergy thanthat such an impression should exst. The clergy jealots of the laity! Jealous of their owTn ons and brothers! Jealous of men taught in the same schools, and united by a thousand ties, to the delight and social happiness of both ! Hie could honestly deolare that hohad been deeply indebted to the laity for their co-opera. tibn many occasions. He beineved it ould be of great advantage to the oouseathattheyashould be abletoconsult
ith their lay brethren on matters of common interest to both. It was most important that it should go forth to the tountry aat there was no jealousy on the pare of the clergy, but that ney would most gladly have the co-operation of their leav brethren.
The gon. Archdeacon The puRP said; the Convocation was essentiay the same as when abbots were returned to ith and, in his opinion, if they introduced the laity it would cease to be a representative body of the Church.
SThe Dean of NobRetc thought the attempt of that ]ouseto introduce the laity into the Convocation was simply impracticable. To introduce such an element did ndt depend upon themselves, but uponta more powecrfEl bed y. hs obhecon, therefore, to the motion was that it was mremature. Hle feared that the Church had in some degree ost the conidence of the public; it was therefore their duty to try and regain that confidence. He believed they had been advancing in that direction. The fact of their having now sat three days in deliberation showed that they were gaining the good opinion of the public. Hle trusted the time would come when the proposal of Mr. Seymour would meet with Thsceess.
bDr. wi'Cht was opposed to the motion, believing that, if adopted, it would tend to the separation of Church and State. They had better keep the vantage ground they already possessed.
The upev. aMr. or AsisnteGlRlg sppor ted the moMton. They were all anious to maintain the union betwreen the Church and the State. It appeared to him that it might he possible, that at the commencement'of each session or of each Parliament, the Horse of Commons might appoint a comimittee consisting of members of the Church of England, to whom al matters relating to the Church agreed to by t4e synod should ba referred before they were decided npon by Parliament itself.
The Rev. Mr. O.Xxars fl said expressions had been used by which it wonld appear that the House took rather unfavourable and gloomy views of the position of the Church, but he was disnosed to take a cheerful view of her
tosion. e e beslieved the Church possessed the confidence of the upoer and more intelligent classes, and that 'with regard to tEie middle and lower classes it had a kind of quasi confidence ;-a confidence in the men who ministered in the Church, rather thas si the bodyto which they belonged. This want of confidence arose from a feeling that they were not droperlyrepyresented in the management of Church affairs.
lhould corhiat the laity had no recognized position in the Church. He was extremcly grateful tlat they had in their Church laym nen of great intelligence and large fortune who -trea strongly attached to the Church, and whose hearts were deeply interested in all that concerned relig,ion. Let them make use of those men, if they could, and bring them in to assist the clergy in al their deliberations tad especially in the management of Church affairs, He hould cordially support the motion.
The Rev. Mr. ILL said, it was a fact patent to every one that the Cherch of England was passing into a different q5osition from that which it held in former times. It had b ecome more independent of the State, and more selfreant. He thought the faithful laity would not desire thatthepeculiarfunctionsof the clergy should be interfered with, but that they would give every aid to maintain the ancient rivtleges of the Church.
The Rev. lI. CASWALL spoke in favour of the original motion.
* The Rev. C. WinILXAuS and the Rev. J. YAHULEa supported the previous question.
The House then divided, when the numoers were-

The motion of the Rev. Canon Seymour was therefore eostponedto a future day.
"The PRoLOCT;TOR was here summoned to the quppeor House, to which he forthwaith proceeded, accompanied byhis assesaors.
rOn his return he informed the Hiouse that the UIpper HIouse had appointed a committie on the subject of missionanres at homeand abroad, and suggested thatntheglaower House should also appoint a committee to communicate and confer with the-committee of the Upper House from time t toime on the subject.
A committee was then appointed for that purpose.

Newspaper Piracy In Nottingham.
I NEWSPAPER PIRACY IN ROTTINGHAM.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-A paragraph with the above heai appears in 2hc Time. of to-day, which, as it contains a serious charge against me, fairly entitles me to ask for space for a short reply. It seemsfrom the paragraph in question, that you havereceived a communication from the conductor of a newspaper called the Nottinghamshirc Guardian, complaining ol the piracy of an article from its columns by the Notting7lam Rericw, without acknowledgment. This complaint of the rviter does not affect me or my paper, and thereforeI am not called upon to defendorexplainin any way the particular larceny in question. It would seem, from the bitterness and unscrupulous nature of the charge, that the conductor of the complaining paper is very much honester in this matter of piracy than any of his local or metropolitan contemporaries, and yet, notwithstanding his excessive purity and the severity of bis censure upon others, he extracts from otner papers several columns of what he considers interesting intelligence, both local and general, and publishes the same every week in his paper without the slghtest acknowledgment whatever. I am afraid, if the truth is to be spoken, that every other newspaper in the kingdom, without exception, does the same thing, some constantly, and others occasionally, to a greater or less extent. But the clause in your paragraph which most injurioursy affects me is this; you say,-
" Our correspondent bitterly complains of the conduct of two of his contemporaries at Nottingham (the Review and the Journal) alleging that they delay the publication of their papers afew hours in order toentoy the benefit of the
Iurlished in the Guardian, which is,,always appropriated without a word of acknowledgment.i
Now, if it were true that I had altered the mode of conducting the business of my paper for the disreputable prpose set forth by your correspondent I should deserve expulsion from the honourable corps of newspaper proprietors, and the severest reprehension and censure. Bat the charge itself is entirely false and has not the slightest particle of truth, as far as the Nottingham Journal is concerned, to suttain it; and, moreover, not only is it false, but, what is very much worse, your correspondentvwhenhewrote it knew it to be so. I have published the Journal more than 16 years, and during the whole of that time and for a hundred years previously I beheve it has uniformly been printed and posted, as it is to this day, on Thursday evening. Instead of postponing our publication, since tho stamp duity was repealed we have gone to press at least an hour sooner than before, The fact is that the complaining paper, after altering its day and hour of publication on several different occasions, has latterly adopted the plan of publishing two or three hiours earlier than we do for the purpose of catching the nrst customers; so that all the substantial change that has taken placo in the time of publication has been made by himself, and not by his local contem-
oraies. He has put himself before us, not we behind m. He knows alt this as bel as I do. It wie be desirable in future, when he undertakes to sit in judgment upon those whom he thinks well to censure for what he considers a breach of the eighth commandment, that he should not forget the claims of its next neighbour-the ninth; that in standing up for honesty he should not forget truth; and that his horror of lying should at least equal his condemnation of larceny. I am, Sir, your faithful servant.

Sir,-Your report in this day's impression of an arran
ment entered into by the Governors of the Middlesex Hospital with Dr. Fell contains an error-YiZ., that the cancer establishmont is now under the superintendence of Dr. Fell, New York, United States," which it is desirable to rectif.
That gentleman, with praiseworthy liberality, has dis
closed, under fair conditions, to the surgeons of this hospital a mode of treating cancer known to himself, and which, on reasonable grounds, appeared to possess decided advantages over other mothods hitherto employed. In the endowed wards appropriated to cases of that disease Dr. Fell has been occupi*d for a fortnight in treating patients, but it bas been, and his treatment will continue, under the observation and with the sanction of the surgeons, with whom the charge of each patient still remains.
Dr. Bell has engaged, after the lapse of a few months, when the benefits of his treatment can he verified by the results obtained in the hospital, to publish his method to the profession.

I (SiUtg at Ki8i 'Priw,' efmorc Lordt CAMPIu, and 1: . a Spedat Jury.V
Sir F. Thesger and the Elon. 0. Denai appearea for the plaintiff; and Mr. Edwin James, Q.C,, and Mr. Hawkins for the defendant.
This easewas in part tried yesterday, and was concluded this day.
The plaintiff, Sir Henry Meux, sued the defendant, Samuel Quartermaine, the horsedealer in Piccadilly, to recover damages for the breach of warranty of ahorse, vhich it was alleged the defendant warranted sound, and ix yesrs old. The defendant denied the warranty, and also pleaded that the horse was sound, and not more than six years old.
Sir F. TuxIGrER in opening the case said,-The plaintiff in thisj action, Sir Henry Meux, is the member for Hertfordsbire, and has a town residence in Brook-street. In the month of March, 1856, he purchased a horse of the defendant for 1801., subject to Lady Meun's approval, but, as the horse was not approved, the plaintiff wrote to say that Lady Meux did not fancy it, and that he thought he ought to havea better horse for the money. Thedefendant replied that he would exchange it for any other horse Lady Meux might like, and from the correspondence it would appear that the defendant considered that an absolute sale of the horse had taken place. The defendant, on the 5th of April, took two horses and two ponies to Brook-street. Sir Henry and Lady Meux liked one of the horses, and, on tbe defendant's saying that he would warrant the horse sound and EiX years old, rising six, the plaintiff agreed to purchase it for 1701., which the defendant observed at the time was 101. less than the price of the first horse. The plaintiff the same day sent for the horse, and having formerly received some good advice from the defendant, he determined to act upon it. The advice was that when the plaintiff bought a horse he ought immediately to have it exercised and examined. Ace ordingly he sent his servant to exercise it in the Park, and then had it examined by Mr. Field. Mr. Field gave a certificate that the horse was unsound, and nine years old. The plaintiff immnediately sent a copy of the certificate to the defendant, who in his reply made no denial that he had warranted the horse, but merely slid that he was sorry the plaintiff did not like it, ard he was rather srprised that he should have allowed his servant to gallop It about the Park, as he had done, and he refused to take it back. The plaintiff upon that wrote a strong letter to the defendant, in which he said the defendant's dishonesty ought to be made public, and threaten. ing to put the inatter in his solicitor's bannds. A correspondence between the attorneys then took place, which the learned counsel read, and this ended in an action being brought by the defendant for the price of
e two orses, for which the defendant claimed 3671. lOs., charging uineas, instead of pounds. The plaintiff was advised to pay into court the sunm of 1781. lOs., the price of the second horse, and this sum the defendant took out of court in satisfaction of his claim. The plaintiff then determined to bring the present action upon the warranty, and having had the horse examined by several surgeons he sold it at Tattersall's on the 28th of June, and got as the produce of the sale only 37. 4s. 6d. There was reason to believe that the defendant had bought the horse, and that it was now in his possession, so tat, as the learned counsel observed, the horse had hitherto proved a very good speculation to the defendant.
The learned counsel then called the following wit-
Sir Henry Meux, examined by Mr. DELNs3t, said,-I am the plaintiff in this action. I have a residence at 41, 'Upper Brook-street, and also at Theobalds-park. On the 15th of March last year I saw a horse in the defendant's stable& I was looking out for a horse for Lady Meux-to ride. I agreed to give the defendant 1801. for the horse, subject to Lady
feues IL provaL lady Me-x did not approve it. On the oth orApril the deeendant, his son, and another man bought two horses and two ponies to Brook-street to my
ouse. Lady Meux disapproved the Ponies. One of the horses, A bay gelding, is the subject of this action. The defendant came to my door, and the horse was trotted up and down by his son. While that was doing the defendant was standing by my door with me, and Lady MeIux was at the library-window. I said I liked the horse-it had a good action, and Lady Meux liked it, too. I asked the defendant the price, and what its age was, and if it was perfectly sound. He said it was perfectly sound and Sax. I said, "Rising six9" and he said, "Yesrising SiLx. He said the price was 1701., and was 101. less than the other. He said this one was in exchange for the other. I agreed to buy tho horse, The other horse had never been out of the defendant's stables. After this conversation, the defendant took thehorse back to his stables. I sent my man, Putterill, for it in about an hour. I had had some advice from the defendant when I was at Oxford. He had advised me when I bought a horse to have it cantered for three-quarters of an hour, to keep it cool, and then send it to a veterinary surgeon's.
Mr. JAES.-Youllearnt that at Oxford? (Laughter.)
The witness continued.-I gave instructions to Putter311 to exercise it, and to take it to Mr. Field. I went to Hyde Park to see PatterijU exercise it. He was cantering down Rotten-row, just as he should do. The same evening I was on the point of starting for Theobalds-park, when Putterill brought me a certificate from MIr. Field. I at once ordered him to take the horse back to the defendant's, and on my rrival at Theobalds-park I wrote the letter of the 5th of April (taken as read}. I saiV Puttezill the next day, and on the 7th I received from the defendant the letter of the 7th of April, and wrote the answer, in which I said the defendant's conduct was "dishonest." I immediately after that put the matter in the hands of my attorneys, Willoughby and Cox. I had an action brought agamst me for 36 10 Ms., and paid 1781. lOs. into court. that sUm was taken out by the defendant in satisfaction. After the horse was sent to the defendant's, I kept it in my own stables for some time, and then sent it to a liverystabiekeeper, May's, whom I paid 91. lOs. for its keep. It was afterwards sold at Tattersall's on the 28th of June. It was sold for 371. 4X. 6d. Among others, thehorse was examined by 3fr. Spooner. He gave a certificate, but I have not got it.
Cross-examined by Mr. JA3ES.-I have mislaid it. He said it was unsound, and nine years old. The unsoundness was a lameness of the foreleg. The defendant said the one horse was five years off and the other six ers off, and he advised me to have the latter. Theist of Mayis the time when half-bred horses complete their year; nd the 1st of January is the timie for thorough-bred horses. I learned that at Oxford, along withthre.(Lutr) He said, moat decidedly" rising siLx.!'I wanted the horse for the yeouanry, A horse seven years old would not be so good for that purpose. When my servant was cantering up, I observed that the horse dropped a little in the forefoot. I did not observe it in his walk, but I did once in h:s trot. My servaut did not gallop the horse-he only cantered it. He took it to Field directly.
Lady Meux, examined by Sir F. THmxoIE.-I went to see the horse at the defendant's, and dii not like it. The defendant came to Brook-street with some horses. I was at the library window. Itwas open. I did not like th ponies I saw the horse trotted. The window was near the door, and I heard the conversation between Sir Henry Meux and the defendant. sir Henry asked if he wamnted the horse sound. The defendant said, "Yes, I warrant him quite sound." He also said, " It is six years old." Sir Henry said, "Is it rising six?" and the defendant answered that it was I don't exactly recollect what avs said about the price. I heard the defendant say that this horse was taken in exchange for the other horse.
Cross-examined by Mr. JArMM.-After the defendant had warranted it sound some statements was made about the age. I heard a great part of the conversation, but not the Strole. Ihad seen a horse a month before for myself at the defendant's stables. The price was 1801. I sent a saddile down from Wilkinson's to be fitted. I changed my mnd about riding, and in about three weeks the defendant brought the other horses to Brook-street. Mr. Cox had brought some horses about an hour before. I did not a prove them. I had seen the first horse canter.
At this stage of the proceedings the trial was adjourned to this day.
William Putterill, the plaintiff's coachman, proved that he exercised the horse as directed by the plantiff; and then took it to Field's to be exasnined. He received a certificate, and gave it the plaintiff. Afterwards he took the horse back,but t wa refsed. fterardshe t okh horse to the Veterinary C>ollege a;nd Mtr.TWurners,eto hchrct

Mr. Field, the veterin surgeon in Oxford-street, said ho examined the horse on te 5tth of April, and found it to be slightly lasme of the near hind leg, ati enlargement of the near hock, and nine years old. After seven there is a doubt about the age. Between five and six you can tell for certain.
Croes-examined.-Thir, is my certiicate. (Read. It was dated in July, and stated that 'he Field, could not see any unsoundness in a horse which Ir. James said he could identify as the one now in question, and that it was seven or eight. If it was six in April it would be right to call it
Mr. Mayor p roved that he examined the horse on the 10th of MIay, and that fromanecnlargement of the near fetlock it was unsound. This ismy brother's certificate. (Read. It stated that thisig hoe was not unsound, had a slight cold,
Mr. Dadley gave smilar evidence.
Cross-examinedt-Was siore ccustomed to dray horses.
Mr. SPOOner, of the Veterinary College, said he had examined thoehrose in May. I pronounced it to be an aged
orse; tat is over seven. There was a slight lameness, but not on the smaller of its tpo feet. The smallness of the foot was congenital.

Mr. Jhh6s said it was, and then read the certficate, which stated that the horse was "1free from any unsoundnltss." (LAughter.)
James Turner suad he examined the horse on the 9th of May,, and gave a certificate that it was eight years old, and b an enlargement of the near hock. B y
Mr. Tattersall proved the sale of the horse. The plaintiff received Si I 4s. G.
Cross-examined.-I knew itto be a horse in dispute. That generally gets known, and the horse fetches less in conse. quence.
I Re-examined.-If a man wanted to get a horse at a low price he would probably circulate such a report.
- ay, a livery stablekeeper, proved that he bad charge of the horse in April and that it was taken care of.
This was the case for the pLaintiff.
Mr. JsM5 then. addressed the jury for the defendant, who, he said, was the well-known and highly respectable dealer in horses in Piccadily. The defendant felt bound
o eend the action, because he thought he had been
treAted rither -capriciously by tE6 plaintiff ifi regard to both-the horses wbich the plaintiff hd bought of him, and hes*ss:therefore desirous of i7ubmittislg rthc question to thajury. The defendant did not dispute that he vwaranted the soun-dness of the horse, but he said that there was no Warranty as to the age, and, even if there had been it was according to the warranty. The first horse had been sold to the plaintiff, and, as Lady Meux t duiiitted, a m'an bad leem sent down fromn Wilkinsob' to t it with X side saddle. Bat her ladyship changed her mind. The defendants ho*OVer, consented to suppli another horse in its stead ; but when he went with them to Brook-street, he was ortifCed to find that another dealer, Cox, had teen there with some horses about half-an-hour before. The defendant woild be called, and he would tell the jury that be, d never sad the horse was "rising six," so that the p laiUtiff Was inaccurate in saying so. As to the age of the horse, it would be clearly proved that it was not more than
iei, though when a horse arrived at that age it was extein el difficult to ascertain the fact with nicety. The
deenat had purchased the horse.back again at Tatter. sail's, and he had since sold it for 80L, it having in the mneantime become ercae ycnrcigte habit of crib-btitng.

I understood the horse was purc'hased for 180 guineas. LAdy Meux said a man should come aan measure the horse for a saddle. That was done and the horse was set Aside for her ladysbhip. Instead o sending for the horse she sent for the saddle. On tho 5th of r tisI took the horse in question to Brook-street. I sold the two cobs to the sueen. The plaintiff asked what I thought would suit him. I recommended the oldest hrsei. I sadoane is five off, aud the one that would suit you is six -off. I ams uh e. sure of that. I said they were sound. The plaintiff said he -would take the elder horse. He wanted it for a hbarger for the yeomanry. A horse at sx off is better for that pur.

GrORGE V. JONES.
Mr. Edwin Jones, Q.C., and Mr. Prentice appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Serjeant Shee and Mx. Pearce for the defendant.
This was an action in which the plaintiff sought to recover damages from the defendant for breaking into his apartments and isaultina ahri, nd also for services rendered by the plaintiff and s wie. The defendant pleadedlthe genera issue.
lMr.JAhment in openeithee ses tedthat the defenant, Dr. Griffith Jones, cale himself a bydro-hommcepathic doctor. He resided at 43, Wobuxfrd-sce, and professed to betendor ofva wonderful patent mediecine which was able to cure all diseases. The medicine -was called " astra mancax," the meaning of which the learned counsel said he had s.ot been able to discover, hut it was recommended by the doctor as a cure for constipation and everything else. The doctor in his prsaetus said he recommendedat sto al his pantients anud ueit in his own household (though he did not say le had ever used it himself). (Laugliter) He sid it was useful in cousumtiftion,_and was an agreeable substitnte for cod liver oil. rem the white sulphur which it contamed it possessed a bland aperient qualty, and from the caseineinwhichitaboundedit madeexcellentfoodforinfants, end his own childhbad thriven upon it for two monthbs. The' defendamnhd eno ged the plaintff to superintend an establishment -which hefad opened for the sale of the astra mancax, at No. 496, New Oxford-street, and the present actiontwas brought for violently expoling the plaintiff fiom his tets in that house on the 7th of July last. The plaintfn that day had written a letter to the defendant,
uesting an aeknowledgement of the olicy on the plaint fds life, upon which the defendant h borrowed 1001., and, being irritated by that letter, the defendant sent a man named Raya and a body of nearly 20 men from St. Gile's, who broke into the plaintiff's rooms, assaulted him violently, and enideavoured to eject him fromthe house. For this gross outrage no justification was pleadea d
The following witnesses were then called:-
William George said,-I amthe plaintiff. lam amedical stuenrt. The defendant is a hydro-homncopathic doctor. He 1ives atNo.43,W obn-place. I became acquainted with himinf I . In about 1853 or 1854 he applied to me to go to No. 496, New Oxford-street. There was a document drawn up, but never signed. The defendant engaged me as manager of the esablshment. I was to sel I patent food called the " astrae mancax." lt is composed of a certain.number of farinaceous ingredients. I can't tell the me anig of the word. I was to live on the second floor, which consisted of three rooms. I was to lecture on the chymastry of food, in order to further the sale of it. I -went in at the end of May, 1855, and continue there til
this occurred. My wife ept the dispensary clean and fit for Dr. Joness patients. The defendant saw hi ents there twice a-wee d She was to be remunerated, the amount was not stated. I was to be remunerated. In the middle of May, 1856, I heard the defendant wished to give nthehouse. I saw the defendant at4 New Oxford-street. Hae caniueupstairs and ased me if I was ready togo out. I said, "Yes, as soon as I receive notice that my reference was correct.' I had appdeed for apartments. He asked me for the key, and I refused to give it, but I afterwards ran after him

Mrs. George attended to treodispensary for 12 months. Thesdefendant had borrowed on a policy on my life 1001. tr. Ray called u on me the same day. He was assistant to Dr. Jones. liccame at 3 cr4 o'clock, or later. I was sitting at my table.I Xhad moved one load of my goods in the former part of theday ad waspackng up the remainder. Ray came again in abent awnahour. fe then brought a number of men. They-were men of the roughest description. There were about a dozen. The back parlour door was burst open, and they rushed upon mne. I got into the front room, anid they kniocked me down. They draged me along. I resisted and was nearl strangled. Theylgkmlt on my breast. The police released me. A written authority -was produced by RAy in Dr. Jones' handwriting. Mr. Ray was here called and askedl to produce the paper. After some hesitation he groduced appr To the best of mv belief this is the

Ray returned again the same day with a dozen or 20 men. They made several attacks on the doors, but I succeeded in keepingthem out. The polie came in after this, and as the
poic came the men gotaway. My wife was very unwell

Mr.-James and Mr. Unthankwere counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. BovMll and Mr. Ogle appeared for the defendant;
This was a scire facias to recover from the defendant, as a shareholder of the Kilkenny and Southtrn and Wester
laillway Company, the balaunco due to the plaintiff, who had ieoveeegnt for 50SI. lOs. against the company, and had taken proceedings against several shareholders, some of which were frurtless, while others resulted in certain payments on account of the debt and costs. In answer to the claim of the plaintiff the defendant pleaded payment and a denial of the fact that he was a sharenolder. As to the first plea, it was contended by the defendant that if the sums recovered by the solicitor of the plaintiff had been fairly applied to the liquidation of the debt the claim of the plaintiff would have been long ago settled in full, but that if it wero not so that state of things was to be attributed to the fact that in many instances the hulk of the payments had been applied to the costs, amounting, as we understood, to nearly 2,0001. As to the second plea, the defence rested on the fact that the defend. ant hadtaken. shares in the Galway and Kilkenny, witha only been obtained for a shorter line under the title of the a capital of 225,0001., in t201. haes, aned,thatr Rtahe djistriu tion of this capital was not fairly conducted by the
The evidence adduced in support of these pleas was sought to be acquired by a inute inqury imto the books and proceedings of the company, the examination of several of its promoters and officials, and the cross-examination of the plaintilFfs solicitor.

To-day, after a diligent search, a Second Court was discovered sitting in the Lords Justices Court, but no notico v; as put up to enable parties whose duty it wvas to attend to find it out.
The only cause tried by Mr. Baron Watson was an inter

It is my uty, anld that of eve omissnioner of the Court of Barp tcy, to conform tote aviews of the Court of Appeal in bankrutcy in reference to certificates; and, therefhore, when I n ound so marked a difference of 'view bne tween myself and the Couwt of Appeal in that ease, I determined to examine Boyd's cease again, and see whathits principl feeatures were, has eridexfuri

torein conformTl; to theuviewsdof the Court above. o have, therefore, ae-erained that case, and I find that its principal features were that Boyd ha commaenced business, in partnership with his brother, aetock a broker in 1824, and continued that business with credit dad respect. ability for 30 years-that is, to the time of his bankrupte '
in March, 185o; that under the bankruptacy only three ordinary debts had been proved against his estate, two in connexion with hfs business as stockbroker, and onea private debt. Of the two business debts one was for 2,50o, provea by a Mr. Simpson, who, however, was amply oovered by Eecurities, through -which he has &ice been full paid, anid the other'was for 35? only. The privateo debt was for cll. l0s. 6a. only. The joint assets received by the officialm any ehave been 5ohs., and the receipts on the sparat
Boyd have exceeded ,0? Boyd therefore was or all practical purposes a solvent man, so far as concerned ordinards ordineunfortunately, however, for him he h in. 184 comtted the'imprudence of becomiing a director and shareholdler in aLjoint.stock bank, which failed in 1848, and Came under the winding-up acts in 1850; and under those sets a call was made on him in 1855 for 304501., which he cculd not mieet, and hence his bankruptcy. The languna
prermibed by the iankrupt Lawpronsolidation Act, 18, to.
e used by a commisioner granting a first-class certificate, is, " And I frther certify that his bnkriuptocy as arisen fror a
unavoidable losses anod misfortunes, and that he isentitled to a certificate of the first class." No loss or misfortune is, strictly speaking, "Iunavoidable;" but as it appeared to sue that if anT loss or misfortune could be deemed "unavoidable,' a lose consequent adpon the imprudence of takinig sharesin a joint-stock bank 14 years before the bankrutcy might fairly be deemed unavoidable within the ruee meaning of the bankrupt law I thought Boyd's came came withi the act of Parliament, and b, therefore, ganted him a first-class certificate, which I was the more willing to do because no creditor made any complaint against him exo ra the official manager under tho winding-up acts. It wcod ill beeome me to exprem any opiion fiom this sat as to whether the sentence in Mr. Boyd's case exceeded the requirements of jstice or not; though, as an individual, I cannot help sympathizing with a person who ends a trading career of 1 years solvent as regirds ordinary debts, and only borne down by a ca under the Windini-up Acts of 30,450is But of this I am sue, tlhat,
if Mr. Bo was rightly punished under the circumstances. of his case by a suspension of his certificate for five years, It is impossible for any commsoner, desirous of acting in ccnformity to the views of the proper courtof appeAlhto award a less punishment thex a total refusal of certificate to a bankrupt, who, like the present, beginning with no capital. at all, has intho short perod of six years inflicted on his creditorsa loss of more th py8i000nt, and has substantially stolen from one gentleman 4 000., and from another 2,000?. on the very eve of banicrpteay. I therefore refime this bankrupt his certificate altogether. I also refuse him protection, and, if any incensed creditor should send him to prison, I shall not relee himrtia he has undergone a
year's imprisonment. If on this occasion I err on the side.- of severity I have the consolation of knowing that my

This insolvent, described asa clerk in holy orders, out

An objection was taken to the jurisdiction of the Court en the ground that the insolvent had made an "escs te" It appeared he was befora the Court on Monday, whenhs cas6 was adjourned until to-day. After the adjournraent, about I o'clock, he went, in custody with Hasted, theofficer, and dined with some friends at a publiechoueo in Portugal:street, opposite the court. Between 3 and 4 o'clock the insolvent left with two other prisoners, in the charge of xasted and his son, to return to the Queen's Prison. On getting into Feet-street a cab was hired, into which the three prisoners: were placed, in charge of young Hasted, wbile bis father: went into ChLanery-lane on other business. After Hasted lcft the insolvent said he should have a cigar, and wenet

I (udii. He got out, and, instead of taking his seat as efore, told young Hated he should go on to 163, Fleet. treet, where the cab was to call for him. Young Hasted leqnested him to return, but he would not, and as te young maanhad two other prisoners in his charge he could not go after him. When the cab reached 163, which was a tailor's abop,where the insolventwas known,hewasnotthere. Young Raisted waited till about 6 o'clock, and his father took the ,ther prisoners baok to prison. About 7 o'clock the same ,evening Colwell, the head officer of the prison, went wita another officer in quest of the insolvent. They drove about in cabs for some hou and at length got soie information 4f his whereabouts. hey traced a woman namned IIEmily," and found the insolvent, about 11 o'clock, in a common brothel in Wellington-street, Lambeth, about a quarter of amilefrom theprison. Several woeuresisted the offirer, and he sent for a policeman. A scuffle ensued with the women, and a door was forced open. The insolvent was fond in bed with a woman, who was trying to eonceal him. After some time he dressed' hlmself; and by force was taken
acc tk aptrison, where they arrived about five minutes to 12 The inuolvent, in explanation of his COnIduct, Eaid he did not intend to escape, but m°eant to return to the prison. He had drunk some port wine, and instead of going to 163, Fleet-}treet, he turned into Cliffordee.in, and called on his late attorne,, Mr. Robeon. He did not see that gentleman
twhe t blihoere had a cup of tea. He afterwardgs returned -iothe publichouse opposite the oourt for a coat he had left. He then took a cab and went over the water, and was discovered, asstated, where he should not have been had he not been drinking. H positively stated that he intnded to return " home" to te prison, where he had been snore than two years. It was his interest to have done so.
It was contended that the insolvent had in law made an 4"spe," which prevented the Courtfrom hearing his case, as he ad not been in actual custody all the time.
Mr. SARGOOD submitted that theinsolvent had not broken custody, and intended to return to prison the same night. It was merely a "freak."
The CTuIV Coboassioazr said, he should hear the case before he gave his opinion on the question. His belief was that the insolvent did not intend to escape. But for his wilfulness in vet going to 163, Fleet-street, he should not have considered him much to blame. The words of the act were, however, very strong, and were that a person should be in "actual custody without any intermission."
The insolvent was asked a few questions as to nroperty. :y the schedule it appears that he was discharged in 1849, ;nd in his present schedule alluded to a reversion expectant on the death of the present Lord Redesdjle and his sister. Where were several detainers against him, which exceeded in amount 1,6004
His HONOUR took time to consider his judgment whether he could entertain the petition.

Central Criminal Court, Feb. 6.
CEZITPAZ CRIMINAL COURT, Feb. 6
OTrB cIOiiMr
(Before Mr. Baron BRIA!rIWELL)
Martha Rebecca Jukes, 30, a poor destitnte-looking creature, was indicted for the capital offence of administering pon to her child, William Juke, with intent to murder him.
The prisoner, who appeared to be absorbed in grief and hardly able to contain herself, was allowed to be seated during the trial.
Mr. Giffard conducted the prosecution. The prisoner was not ablo to obtain the assistance of courseL but the Sherif
having become acquainted with her niserable and destitute voriAiqn, kindly zteained Mr. Sleigh to watch the case in 'her- behLal.
Mr. GIFPAD, add&ssing the jury, said that the ciroumatances of this cas were very short, but were of the most painful character. It appeared that the prisoner formerly Jived at Stepney with her husband, and a short time back she went to Yarmouth for the purpose of burying her father, and upon her return ahe found that her husband 'during her absence, had destroyed himself, and she was left 'with her child in a most destitute and miserable contition. She for some time vainly endeavoured to sup. port herself and child by needlework, but, finding that Ebe was unable to do so, it appeared that she purehased some laudanum at a chymist's, and in a fit of desperation she took a quantity of it herself, and admin nistered the remainder to her child, and both their lives were in consequence nearly sacrificed. The prisoner, after committing the act, said that her objeot was that she and her child should go to Heaven together, and upon these facts he was afraid, if the jury should be of opinion that at the time of the commission of the act the prisoner was in such a state of mind as to be responsible for her actions, it would be their painfiul duty to find her guilty ; and the eonly question they would really have to consider was the risoner's state of mind.
Mr. S. J. Burch, house surgeon at the London Hospital, was then examined, and he stated that on the 5th of January the prisoner was brought to the hospital in the afternoon. She was in an almost unconscious state, evi-
enutly from the effects of laudanum, and, having administered an emetic, the result confirmed the opinion that she ad taken opium. When she had a little recovered he asked her how she came to do it, and she said that sho was anxious that she and her child should go to Heaven, to meet its father, who had gone there. Witness then sent for the child, and he found that it was also suffering from the effects of laudanum. The child was about four or five years old. When the prisoner had somewhat recovered she told him that she had beea to Yarmouth to bury her father, and on her return she found that her husband had committed suicide, and since then she had been endeavouring to support herself and child by needle. work, but,beingunable to obtain asubsistence bythat means she purchased some laudanum, took pait of it herself, and gave the remainder of it to her child. The child was in a dangerous condition when it was brought to the hospital, nud would probably have died but from the circumstance tfhat it appeared to have had a considerable portion of food in the stomach at the time the laudanwm was administered and this Dreveuted it from being so rapidly absorbed into the system is it otherwise would.
B 3Mr. SLErGir.-The prisoner, when she was brought to the hospital, was in a most miserable and distressed state, and in all his experience he had not seen anything like it. If he had been called upon at the time to express an opinion ;upon the state of her mind he should certainly have said that he considered her so broken in mind that it had engen;dered aform of insanity known as " melancholia," and that she did not know the nature of the act she had committed.
In answer to a question put by the learned JuinGz, the -wituess said that he considered the prisoner was in that state of mind ;ersona were in who committed suicide.
Hannah williams said that she lived at No. 14, Bedford-street, Stepney, and the prisoner and her child lived in the same house. On the 5th of January the prisoner appeared in a very excited state, and was raving about her husland. The prisoner and her child were afterwards taken ill, and upon witness going into her room she saw a bottle that was labelled " Laudanaum," ind a mug was by the side of it.
By Mr. SLEiGH.-The prisoner h. d been lodging in her house about five weeks. She vas suddenly summoned to Yarmouth on account of the deatV of her father, and during hier absence her husband destroyed himself.
Mr. Burch was recalled, and in answer to questions put by the learned judge he said that, in his opinion, at the time the prisoner admiinistered the laudanum to the child she was mot aware of the nature of the act she was committing or that it was contrary to law.
This closed the case for the prosecution.
Mr. Sxn GEthen made anmost feeling and eloquent appeal to the jury on behalf of the wretched prisoner. He said that in his experience he did not recollect a case of so distressini and miserable a character as the present, and he felt satisfied that upon the facts before them the jury would much rather be conferring together in the warmth of their Mearts to ^onsider what they could best do for the benefit of fthe wretched woman at the bar than be empanelled to try her upon the present charge. He then drew a forcible picture of the wretchedness and misery the prisoner bad undergone, and urged that the only reasonable conclusion they could come to was that the mind of the prisoner had become disturbed, and that when she administered the poison to hereelf and her child she really was in such a state as not to be responsible for her actions.
Mr. Baron BRAisiwELT, who was considerably affected while summing up, said that the case was certainly one of the most distz essing he had had to deal with during his ahort experience, with the exception of one where a similar attempt was successful, but they mnst deal with it notwithstanding, and must endeavour to strengthen themselves to perform the painful duty that devolved upon them in this as in every other case. If they gave to the statement of the prisoner that sbe intended by what she had done that herchild should go to Ecaven, the only reasonable interpretation that could be put upon it-naniely, that she intended to destroy the life of her child, he did not see how they could come to any other conclusion than that she was guilty of the crime. There then, however, remained the question as to the state e! the prisoner's mnind2 and if they should be of opinionthat atthe time she commtte the act she was ntot aware of the niature of it, or that it was contrary to the law, they -wouldbe justified in acquitting her on the ground of insaraty.
The jury, after a short deliberation, said that they were of opinion that the prisoner committed the act while labouring under temporry insanity,lproduced by the circumstances in which she had been placed.
Mr. Baron BRAUIV5ELL said that this amounted to a verdict of acquittal on the ground of insanity, and he ordered the prisoner to be detained during Her Majesty's pleasure.
William Gaylor surrendered for the purpose of receiving the judgment of the Court.
The prisoner, it will be remembered, was convicted two or three sessions back of administering a poisonous ingredient to his wife for the purpose of procuring a miscarriage, but a
point of law was reserved for the consideration of the Court of Criminal Appeal as t*the propriety of the verdict, there being some peculiar circumstances in the case. The conviction nas since been confirmed, and the prisoner, who was admitted to bail, was therefore called up for judgment.
Mr. Baron BRAiiWELL said he was directed by thelearned judge who tried the prfisoner to state that, under the peculiar circumstiances of the case, he considered the proe of justice would be answered in this particularecase by a sentence of one month's imprisonment with hard labour, and he now, therefore, passed thtat sentence upon him.
Henry Holding, 19, was charged with committing an asaault of an atrocious character upon William Smith.
Mr. Caarteen prosecuted.
The prosecutor was a lad 16 years old, who stated that he 'vas by birth an American, and that at the tine the offence was committed he was on his way to Liverpool to seek a ship, and he eaid that he met the prisoner and walked with him as far as Barnet, and in a field in the neighbourhoodofthat town he represeuted that the matter occurred wlhich was the subject of inquiry. His statement was confirmed apparently in some particulars, and the jury, after a little deliberation, returned a verdict of Guilty.
Mr. Baron BRAMWELL thereupon ordered sentence of death to be recorded, but he evidently felt that there was eoneiderable doubt as to whether the prosecutor was telling tbe trath, and he directed the officer to go with him to one ar two places whero he represented he had been on the aught prev'ons to the occurrence, and make inquiries, and they left t,he o onrt for that purpose.
Shortly aiim-wards the eoustable returned, and stated that as5 heB wagfs going along with the boy Smith in a cab to

The learned JUDGE then ordered the boy Smith into cus i tody, mith a vit, if the facts should admit of that course being adoeed, that a prosecution for perjury should be pre. ferred against him.
Henry Mller, 2Q, and Johna WilliaiDs, 22, were indhicted for a robbery with violence upon Joseph Harris.
Mir. Payne conducted the prosecution; Mr. orrwas counsel for Mtiller.
The prosecutor, it appeared, was in ltoae-lane, Sbadwell, in the middle of the day 'when he was assailed by three men, knocked down, most brtally treated, and robbed of his watch. The prisoners were proved to have been two of the party who committed the outrage.
The jury found both the prisoners Guilfy, and it was proved that Miller had been twice before convicted of
gfr. Baron BRtAMwXL, in laSsing sentence, eaid that it uyd taks p aosbstoniahing thin8 that acts of this kind rhudtk Lace in the streets of LSondon in broad day, and it was more likeo what would have happened ipon HIounslowr-heath a hundred years ago. He then sentenced Miller to four yea penal zernitude, and Willams to be transported for 15 years.
John Cooper 22 was indicted for a robbery, with violence, upon Joh6 TRornton.
The prosecutor, it appeared, wi.s the captain of a vessel, and at 7 o'clock in the evening he was walking along a place called Chigwiell-hil, St. George`s-in-the-East, when he was attacked from behind by three men, one of whom knocked him down, and while he was upon the ground an attempt vas made to snatch his watch from his fob. He called out for assistance, and a respectable young woman named Anne Wright,who resided near the spot, tan out, and, seeing what was going on, she, with great intrepidity5 laid hold of the pnsoner and held him, notwithstanding his violent struggles to escape, until some one came up and secured him.
The ury found the prisoner Guity, and he Was sentenced to four years' penal servitude.
His LoRDSmp then requested the witness Wright to stand forward, and said that the intrepid manner in which she had acted did iher great credit, and, if she woould accept it, he thought it was a ease in which he would be justified in ordering her a reward.
The witness having thanked his Lordship,
Tlhe learned JuDGE ordered that the sum of 0I should be given to her, as a reward for the bravery she had exhibited upon the occasion.
It was tatqtd in the course of the day, In reference to the case of the unbqpy woman^- Jukes, that the Sheri&s were mnosthumanely interfering on her behalf; and at their request Mr. Burch, the medical gentleman who had been examined, was called upon to see her in the gaol, and give a certificate as to her present condition. Se accordingly did so, and gave a certificate to the effect that the unhappy woman was sane at the present moment, hut in a very low and desponding state, and that she could not he setat liberty with safety to herself or others until her mind was more composed. There is, howvever, very litte doubt that
hen her mind is pcerfectly restored she will be set at liberty, and that some measures will be taken to give her a chance of maintining herself in future.
NEW COURT.
(Before the REcoiy)
Robert Hunt, 54, agent, was indicted for feloniously receiving 1041b. of silk, valued at I8, the prope ty of Henry William Eaton, knowlug it to have been stolen.
Mr. Bodkin, Mr. Tindal Atkinson, and Mr. Poland prosecuted - and Mr. Ribton defended.
The facts of the case lay in a very narrow compass, although the investigation lasted the greater portion of the day. On the 13th of January a quantity of raw silk was being taken to the warehouse of the prosecutor, 33, Old Broad-street. The van stopped in Little Love-lane to make some deliveries, and while the carman was so engaged one of thebalesof silk was seen by a boy to be taken from the van, put into a chaise-cart, and driven Away. The boy afterwards informed the police of what had taken place, and upon the 16th Packman and Bull, two detective officers belonging to the city police, went into Spital-square, where they saw the prisoner, who had a parcel containing sonme raw silk. Prisoner then took a cab and drove to Hatton-garden, where he was followed by the constables, who stopped him as he was entering No. 14, and told him they were officers, and asked him how he became possesed of the silk he hsd in that parcelL He said that was his business. They then went into the back parlour, where the whole of the silk which had been Etolen was lying. Upon the officers first questioning prisoner he said he should answer no questions, but afterwatds taid he received it from a Mr. Bacon, living in Anchor-street, Spitalfields, who had given it to him for sale.
Bacon was called and examined, and swore that he had not given the prisoner the silk; but, on the contrary, the prisoner had offered it to him for sale, and had taken him FBacon) to his house to look at it.
On cross-examination Bacon said he got his living by buying and selling job lots of slk. He never kept an account of the business which he did. He had dealt with the prisoner. Twenty years ago he was charged about aQme silk taken from his house. He was discharged and the goods restored. He was now an-uncertificated bankrupt, and had been for 13 years.
Mr. RIBTON, for the defence, in a most able speech, argued on the danger the jury would incur in convicting the prisoner upon the evidence of Bacon, who, if he had not told the tale he had, would be in the same situation as the prisoner.
The Jury returned a verdict of Not Guilty.
e THRD COURT.
Before the COssON-SiUEn^A.)
Henry Belcler, 24, schoolmaster, surrendered to take his trial upon an indictment charging him with publishing a libel concerning one Benjamin Clements.
Mr. T. Atkinson prosecuted, and Mr. Robinson defended. The prosecator is a gentleman who for about 20 years has kept the Belmont-house grammar-school, Turnhamgreen. At Michaelmas last he engaged the defendent as general assistant-tutor, and when he entered n on his duties gave him a written list of instructions, whic were put in and read, for the general moral training of the pupils out of school hours, enjoining the defendant to be most gentlemanly and kind in his conduct. For some breach of these rules the prosecutor felt it his dutytodiscbarge defendant at Christmas, and refused to give him certificates of proper conduct. This appeared to have so nettled the defendant that he not only sent a libeUous and insolent letterto Mr. Clements, but also sentone to one of the pupils' fathers, imputingirregularties in the management of the school likely to be most ,i unrious to the boys, and that was the libel complained of. When taken before the police magistrate defendant offered an apology, but the prosecutor, whose only aim was to clear his own character, felt it his duty to carry the case before a jury. The prosecutor, upon being examined, moat positively said he did not believe in the assertions made by the defendant. He was himself but little from home, and alwaysblooked strictly after his pupils. It was the defendant's special duty also to keep a very strict surveillance over them after school hours, an he never had any complaint from him until after he had discharged him.
The gentleman to whom defendant had written was examined, and said he had questioned his two sons, but learnt nothing from themto bear out the defendant's assertion.
Mr. RoBncsoN, after some consultation with the defeadant's friends, said that he felt bound, even in opposition to his client, to exercise his own opinion, which was that the defendant should apologi7e for sending the letter.
The ComsmoN-SFsnJsxTyr said, he thought sich a course was the most proper, and due to Mr. Clements.
The defendant, who was much excited, after some hesitation consented to that course, and, a verdict of Gutlty being taken,
The COMBION-SERJE-ANT, having complimented the counsel upon both sides for the course pursued, admitted defendant tobail, to come up for judgment.

MAIsNox-HIouSL-- Joseph William Hawes, a res ectablelooking man of about 50 years of age, was brought before the LORD MAYOR upon a warrant which charged him with having feloniously forged and uttered a receipt for 2901., with intent to defraud the Poor Law Guardians of the City of London Union.

LsmBETIL-The Hon. G. C. NORTON was engaged for three hours in further investigating the charge against Richard Smith, a powerful fellow, a sailor, who lost his right arm daring the Crimean war, of having caused the death of a man nained Kieff by alleged brutal violence on Boxing-night Last.
Mr. Thomas Kirwan King, the parish surgeon of Camberwell, deposed, that oa the next day but one after Boxingday, he saw the deceased man Kieff at Camberwell Workhouse, and he was then suffering under intense pain. He had a lacerated wound on the top of his head, but more towards the back. He had also a contusion on the upper part of the chest bone, and two of his ribs on the left side and one on the right were broken. There Was a considerable braise on the chest, and the upper bone of the sternmn was fractured, and he com lamed of difficulty of breathing. The wound on the hesw was a flat wound of a semicircular shape, and had not been inflicted by a sharp instrument. It was about 21 inches in diameter, and fell downwards towards the baa of the neck, and it was Mr. Kng'sopion that thiswound couldnot have beencaused by a fall, for if so the scalp would have been drawn upwards. The injury itself was of so serious a character that a fill to cause it must have dislocated the vertebrie of the neck. He was of opinion, also, that a faU from any height would not have produced the injury to the chest or ribs, and not have injured the face also, and the only way that a faU would have caused such injuries was by the chest coming in contact with some hard projecting aubstance. The broken ribs were in connexion with the injury to the chest, and must have been done at the same time. The deceased was quite sensible up to a day before his death, and, though he had survived the injuries nearly a fortnight, he had not made any statement as to how they had been caused, and he (Mr. King) was under the impression that they were caused by the fall from a loft and a kick from a hors$e and remained under this impression till he heard that there was to be a coroner's inquest. The only way that the injury to the chest could have been done by a horse would be by the aninial trampling on him, as there was no injury done to the skin nor to the face. He (31r. King) could not understand how the deceased could have received all these injuries, and did idnotthinkthattlhe wound attheback part of the head and the severe ijuaries to the sternum could have been done at the same time. He thought that there must have been more than one cause, as the injuries to the head and chest could not have been caused by a single act or fall, bt, having heard what he did at frst, he was under the iapression that it might have been done by a fall and a kick irom a horse. Witness had seenthe ldder in the stable of Mr. Davis, leading to the loft where the deceased was on the morning.of Christmas-day1. It was quite erect, and had marks of blood oin it, andhe did lot think it possible that the deceased could have got up that ladder without assistance after receiving his injuries. He rmight have walked a little, but to get up the ladder it would be abslutlynecssay or im o se isarms, and by doing sohe would ddisplace the bones of the fractured rnbs on
attorney, and, in repltoyhisXquestion~ h E
ahoree After falling would have produced the same injuries done to the deceased. A kick from both the hind legs of the horse would have not caused them. The only way thLat the horse could have caused the injuries to the chest was by trampling on the deceased with something be. tween the person of the deceased and the horssfe op~
vent abreaigo h ln tteconcILusion of his evidence M1r. King was shownthe artifiia arm of the prisoner (a formidable weapon with at knob of iron at the end, And to which a hook as Attached) and the long-handled mnallet p roduced bn a former day, and After examinng both carefullyhe said the latter was the more likely instrument to produce the injurxies on the person of the deceased.
VWilliam. Osborn, a witness who had been exasninedat the first examnination, 'and who said he bad been urged to come, forward by the workings of a troubled conscienice,I added some important evidence to his former statement. He said that on the morning. of Boxing-day he heard a gentleman who had two carriage horses 1in thle sta:ble at the Edinburgh Castle speak to the deceased about attendin
to his horses and harness, and ho then said that he ZOMl turn a pair of horses aud a set of harness outtas well as any man, but it was of no use attending to his (the gentleraman.) horses;, as he would have All the trouble, while Smith (the prisoner) would have the pay. Smith was Present at the timne, and he and the deceased qarirelled and, had some high words, when Smith said to lrieff, irA a very wratbful manner, "i'lb n ihyu for this." The witness further said that his opinion had been formed fromn wbat he had witnesed ODn the following morning, when decae

He (witness) aaIedhirm how he came by his injuries, and he replied that lie'did not know any more than a child.

Dreadful Colliery Explosion In The West
D3AZD&uL COLLIERY EXPLOSION II TRE WEST RThDfG.-Mr. Jewison, the district coroner, held a lengthened inquiry on Thursday, at Schoalez, in the parish of Birstal, near Bradford, touching the deaths of four men who were kIlled by a colliery explosion on Tuesday last. The names of the deceased are Ezra Kellett, of Wike ; John
ordoff and John Bobinson, of Wibsey; and Samuel Robertshaw, one of the proprietors of the coalpit where the terrible accident occurred. M orton, the Government inspector of mines, attended to watch the proceedings. It appears that the deceased and some other men weremployed toxnlc apitintheMkb Ead-excavatid to the depth of 5u yards. There is an engine to pump the water out of the working, and to put in motion a fan, about a yard in diameter, which forced the air into air pipes measuring only 9 inches by 5 inehes. Roberthvaw was one of the partners in the undertaking, and cted as general manager; he had been advised toinsert air pipes measuing 22 inches by 11, but persisted in having the former ones, although on Wednesday in last week he expressed an opinion that there was sulphurous air in the pi- The fan performed about 250 revolutions per minute. The air pipes, after the workmen had been standing a fort, night for want of them, were placed in the pit on Friday and Saturday last, and the work was resumed on Tiesday morning, Monday having been occupied in pumping out the water, which had accumulated to the depth of eight feet. Dluring Tuesday prearatons were matde for blastine* a
2ole2 inches in dmeter was drilled to the depth o thwo feet into the stone strata, filled with gunpowvder, and about X o'clock in the afternoon all was ready for firing. Ezra Kellott first went down with a safetyLamp, as the pit ha been in such acondition for six weeksthattheyduzetnot nusE candles, and reported that there was no mlphur of any consequence. A ring was made red -hot, this means of ignition being considered safer than by a naked light, and it Was lowered into the pit byRo inson. The three other unfortunate men, Robert. slaw, Kellett, and Tordoff, looked down the Pit to watch the operation- the moment however, that tle ing came in contact ;wila the inflamnmale fas, which mnust bave gut into the pit through a "drift, $a tremendous explosion took place, the four men were blown into the air, and thrown a considerable distance, and a fifth Henry Sharp was knocked down insensible. When the latter recovered Loe observed Tordoff 'with hIds skul completely stripped o its hair, Robertaw and Kellett ute dead, and Robd hof laid moaning on the ground.

The Alleged Poisoning Of Mrs. Bacon, At Stamford.
2'HT A4ZLED POLSOYNG OF AJUS. BACON, i Af STMO^ .
T| betaders of! eTiemc.s are awaie Uhat, durn the Invc .~ tigation incident to the iufdearstWalworth, circumstances transpired tending to excite suspicion that Ann Bacon (mother of the prioner, Thomas Fuller Bacon), who died at Stamford in May, 1855, was poisoned by the adminisa. tion of arsenic. In con- que seE this, after cominunI. cating with the authorities of Stamford, the Home Secre. tary ismed orders for the exhumation of the body of the deceased, who was Interred at Great Casterton, a nall village in the county of Rutland, about two miles from Stamford. Professor Taylor, who had been direcea to superintend the exhumation, proceeded to Stamford for that purpose1 ia arrived theto at 10 'clock on Thuday night.
At 11 o'clock yesterday morning Dr. Taylor proceeded to Great Casterton, accompaied by Mr. IL W. Jackson, surgeon, of Stamford, by whom the body was to be opened under the Professor's supervision. Meanwhile a resetable jury, composed prindpAly of farmers, had been empa. nelled at the Plough Inn. On the arrival of Dr. Taylor,
The coroner (Mr. Hougb, of OAkham) briefly charg.A the -iury, and at the close of the ooroner's address, Dr. Taylor suggestd that the jury should go to the grave where the body was interred, in order that they mnight sce it taken up.
The coroner, jury, audmedical gentlemen then proceeded tothe churchyard. Inthemeantimethegravehadbecnopened andthe cofn Laid ba At 12 o'lock the coffin was rised fromthegrund,andfoundtobeinaperfectlysoundcondition. Thelidof the coffin beingretnoved,thecorpsewas expesedto view. The head and feet, which were uncovered, resem. bledthose of an Egyptian mummy, so unich were they discoloured by decomposition. The features, however, were so far perfect as to elicit exclamations of recognition from those present who were acquainted with the deceased. The Identity of the corpse having been proved, the body ws conveyed to an adjacent barn for the removal of the viscera.
The following is a sUmmary of the evidence adduced:-
James Peat, parish clerk and sexton, of Caserton, who had knowvn deceased from childhood, deposed to the identity of the body.
Mary Scholes, washervoman, who had been frequently t Mrs. Bacon's hous duringthe last eight years, stted that deceased was a very strong woman, and generally en. joyed excelent hekth. On Sunday night, the 13th of May, 1855, two days before M. Bacon died, Thomas Fuller Bacon came to my house, and said the old lady (meaning his mother) was very bad, and that she would die, and that I must go directly and remain with her all night. I followed him to his mother's house about five minutes Afterwards. On arriving there I found Mrs. Bacon in bed. Mr. and Mrs. Bacon and Thomas Fuller Bacon were with-her. William Bacon is another son of the deceased, and brother to T. F. Bacon. Iaskeddeceasedif she was ill-if her head was bad and she replied that abe was " bad all over." I remained al
night with deceased. She was sick twice-once shortly after I got there, and then again between 10 and U o'clock. During the night, While I was sitting up with her, deceased told mo she had been to church in the morning, and that she had intended to o again in the afternoon, having left her Prayer-book for that purpose, but that she was taken suddenly ill after dining at her son Thomas's. She said they had a nice puddir and meat for dinner. Deceased told me she was put to ted il about 3 o'clock that afternoon. I think the dinner hour would be 1 o'clock. Deceased said it was not the pudding or meat that made her ill, but that they were making broth for T. F. Bacon's little boy, and she made her dinner chiefly of that. She said she became suddenly sick and purged. Sbe told me she was laid on her son Thomass bed, and that Mr. Barber, a medical gentleman of Stamford, was sent for about 5 o'clock. She added that she was removed to her own house in a sedan between 5 and 6 o'clock- the sme evening. Deceased was very thirsy during the night, and was stifalUover. Whenever I asked her where her hurt was she repeatedthatshewaz il all over. I asked her if shehad ever been taken so before, and she said she had not. She complained of her feet being cold, and I applied warm water in bottles. She did not complin of cramp. Her son Thomas had a key of the outer door, and came in three times in the course of the night. He asked how his mother was, and appeared verr ious. I remained with Mrs. Bacon until 9 o'clock on Monday night. Sheo was a great deal better during the da, and her son Wiliam and
vwife had tea with her upstairs. Thomas Bacon and his wife also were backwards and forwards at the house several times during the day, and he seemed anxious and always in. qulred about his mother. I left deceased about 9 o'clockon Monday night in the care of Mrs. Blake. Between 5 and 6 o'clock on the following morning (Tuesday) T. F. Bacon came and called me upe He said, "The old lady's worse, and she'U die now." Hewaited until I got down, And then went for Dr. Barber. Bacon had been backwards and forwards at his mother's house ¢n the Monday night, as he had on the previous night. Ifound MrBacon in bed, and very ilL She said she was a great deal worse. M Blake was the only other person in the room when I got there. M Bacon desired me to ask Mr. F Barber fhethought she would die, as she thought she
should. She said she wanted to know, in order that her daughter might be sent for from Titchimarsh. Mr. Barber came about 7 o'clck. I sasked him if ho thought thmre was
any dangr, and he said, " No ; it was not necesary to send for the Eughter.d I thought aU dy that Mrs. Bacon Would die. She was very feverish after lr. Barber's vist, and about 11 o'clock was delirious. She was alternately cold and hot. Mr. Barber was again sent for between 10 ana 1L Ee recommended a warm bath, which she had. Deceased was at that time so stiff that we could scarcely get her clothes off and get her into the bath. The bath seemed temporarily to revive her. I agan asked Mr. Barber as to the propriety of lMrs Bacon's daughter being sent for, and he then recommended that course. Mr. Barber came again about 9 o'clock that night. He said she was Anking away for want, and ordered some port wine. She was delirious both before and After taking the wine, and died about U o'clock. Her son Thomas was continually in the house during the Tuesday. and was present when sho died. Her son William Bacon, his wife, and Mrs. Scholes, were also present. There was a little dispute between the two brothers about deo ceased's rent-book. This took place while the mother was dyin Mrs. Scholes " hushed" them and said their mother could hear if she could not speak. Thomas had taken the rentbook out of the house. I heard William Bacon's wife tell Thomas that his mother had made a will. Thomas told me that his brothers had had their fortune. He did not know that his mother had made a widow's will
And seemed quite surprised that she had done so. He tol4 me he exped he should get the propetty at his mother's death. My husband was a tenant of Mrs. Bacon, and I always paid her the rent during her lifetime. Uon her deatn I paid it to Thomas Puller Bacon. I hadalways understood that he would become possessed of his mother's property at her death.
Mark Wilson Jackson, gurgeon, of Stamford, was the next witness. He said,-I have been in practice as a sur. geon In tho town of Stamford for upwards of 30 years. I was present this morning when a cofin containing a corse,
represented to be the body of Mrs. AnR BACOn, Was t -en out of the ground in Great Castorton churchyard. I have since made a poaet norten examination of the abdomen, and removed the whole of the contents. I also removed the heart, the blood, and such other parts of the chest as Dr. Taylor, who was present with me, thought requisite for his guidance in making his analysis. These various portions of the body were deUvered to Dr. Taylor. I am unable to express any opinion upon them at present.
Alfred Swaine Taylor was then sworn and examined. He deposed as follows :-I am a Fellow of the Rayal College of Physieians, and have been lecturer on medical jurisprudence and chymistry at Guf's Hospital, London, for 26 years. I was present this morrnig at the exhumation of the body of a person represented to be Ann Bacon. I was also present at the inspoction of the body made by Mr. Jackson, who removed inmy resence, and delivered to me, those parts of the body whOcU I considered necessary for making a complete chymical analysis for the detection of poison. 1 placed. these parts In a perfectly clean jar, and well secured the jar, sealed it with my seal, and delivered it to Superintendent Mitchell. Te blood removed from the chest by Mr. Jackson was plaed is a clean bottle, which was also sealed and delivered to Superintendent Mitchell. A portion of the earth taken from under the coffin and the sides of the grave has also been removed for aualsis. I am unable at present to sa
from the appearance of the viscera, whether they do or do not contain poison. This can only be determined by a complete ohymical analysis.
Elibeth Blake who attended deoeased, aid the observed that her sands were continull; "t-witchini," and that after this ahe began to atwitch all over. 5eceased said she felt as if paralyzed from head to foot. Witness added,-Mrs. Bacon told me she went to dine with her son Thomas on the Sunday, and that she had scarcely done dinner when sho was taken Ill. Two or three times during the night that I slept with her deceased clasped her bands together, and appeared strongly convulsed.
William Mayes Hibbins examined.-I was formerly
an apprentice to Thomas Fuller Bacon. A'bout a week before Mr Bacon died I was working in the hop after tea, when Bacon came In and told me to go to the shop of Mr. Wl1ford, druggist, for six ponnyworth of arsenic. He gave me the Money to pa-y for it, and said, "1If they ask you w7hat it is for, youL must tell them it is for hardening mion I went to f Mr. Wlford's in Hligh-streot, Stamford, and asked tho assistant for six pennyworth of arsenie, and he said I eould not have it without a witness. There was also an apprentioe in the shop at the time. Upon thisIwentbackto theworkshop, whero I found Bacon tSanding aginst a vic in tho position I had left hirn. He said " Where is it' I told him they would not let me have it without a witness. He-laughed it off, apad said, " Oh, never mind; I'll get it mysef."
Coroner.-Th it a oommon thing to use arenic for hardening iron?
Witness.-Xo* we never used anything but prassiate of potash. At the time I was sent for arsenic we had no ironto harden, as Bacon's busineswas principall mending locks and grates and bellhanging. I never jnewr of arsenic beinz used for hardening iron. I remem.r hearing of Mrs. Bacon's death, which took plae about a fortnight before I left. It occurred to me as very strang thatshe should gooffin the manner she did, especaly in ounexionwith thefact of my beigsentfor asenic. On
ths Thursday and Friday after Mrs. Baon's death I was at work with my master; e seemed in a very queer temper, and struck me on each of those dayg-a tbing he had never done before. Durn; the fortnight I remained with Bacon he did very little work himself, and gave 3ne little to do. As he would not set me to work I asked him for my indentures, and he gave them up to me. IHe was not addictd to drinking, but on the day after his mother's death he sent me for a gallon of beer. Shotly after leaving Bacon's service I mentioned to my fatheraboOt

Sir,-Will you permit me, in reply to your article of to-day, to state, after many yeas' experience, the result oE giving honestly to servants the characters those servants. may deserve; of calling things by their right names-thus,. athiefathief; a drunkard adrunkard,and so on.
The better as weU as the worst claw of servants bangto their own order; they have their clubs, their plxce6 of meeting, tho publichouses which theyfreqcent, in which, besides matters affecting the cloth, tho characters and privateaffairs of their masters are discussed; everything is known, and the certain penelty for sefusing a character or giving a. true one to a dishonest or incompetent servant, and thus honestly doing your duty, is that, unless you give a highet rate of wages than the market easily commands, none but. the refuse will enter your service. These worthies combine, -why should not their masters ?
A society on the principle of the Mendielty Society, the busmess of whose offcers should be to seek for and obtain any information required by the members about to engage. servants; who'should also keep books in which the results of those inquiries were resWered and recorded, with an officer
whose special duty it should be to prosecute those master6 who might be convicted of giving false characters to theirservants, would in the course of a few years greatly improvethe breed of domestics, and remedy what you justly calL "one of the miseries of civilized life!'
I am, Sir. vour obedient servant.
