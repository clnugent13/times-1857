THE COUJ?B8z oBzBX,RANGZ. Jan. 13.
l :OAY-MARKT.-am C1TYDSTTBLLI4pBqOB I T o g s a b~~~~~Tpsy EveTnirg The quotationfigold at Paris is about 6peraill premium, and the shorteichange onhondon is25.20 per l. sterling. On comparingtheserates with the Inglish Mint price of 31. 17s. 10id. per ounce for standard gold, it appears that gold is nearly 5-lOths per cent. dearer in Paris than in London. By advices from Hamburg the price of gold is 423 per mark, and the short exchange on liondon is 13.24 per 11. sterling. Standard gold at the English int price is therefore about 8-lOths per cent. dearer in Hamburg than in London. The English funds opened this morning at a further reduction, and subsequently experienced several variations. Consols for money, which closed last evening at 93i, were first quoted 934 to i. Some purchases on the part of the public then caused a recovery, which was assisted by a revival of the statement that the Bank of France are about to increase their capital, the inference being that after that step they will again be ready to assist the speculators on the Bourse. Transactions accordingly took place at 931, but the fact of the East India Company having raised their rate for bills to a point which will most probably cause the exportation of silver to be resumed with unabated force prevented the market from exhibiting any great animation, and the final prices were 934 for money, and 94 for the 5th of February. Bank Stock left off at 216 to 217k; Reduced, 93 toX New Three Per Cents., 94i to A; India Stock, 219 to 221; chequer-bonds, 98i to 99; India Bonds, par to 3s. premium; andExchequer-bills, par to 4s. premium. The charge for money onGovernment securities in the Stock-Exchange to-day was 6 per cent. At the Bank of England the demnand was heavy, and in the discount-market there was continued activity at full rates. Foreign securities were heavy, and a slight decline took place. The preliminaries for the arrangemient of the account prmcipally occupied attention. In Turkish Six per Cents. the transactions were, for money, at 94f, 95, and 944, and for the account at 95i. The Four per Cents. Guaranteed were negotiated at 103, 1034, and 103i. The other business comprised-Brazilian New, 98i; Chilian Six per Cents. 105; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 78j and 78; Russian Five per Cents., 107; the Four-and-a-Half per Cents. 97, 954, and 964i; Sardinian Five per Cents., 89i and 89; Belgian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 98; Dutch Two-anda-Half per Cents., 644 and 65; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 98. In the foreign exchanges the rate upon Hamburg was again rather lower. VWith regard to other places there was no alteration from last post. The quotations from the Paris Bourse this evening again failed to arrive. Yesterday the final transactions in the Three per Cents. were at 68f. for money and 68f. 30c. for the end of the month, showing an imprvovement of i per cent. The specie by the Canada from Boston to-day is 54,0001. The whole wiUl be sent to the continent. The new rates of exchange announced by the India House are 2s. id. on Bombay and 2s. Id. on Calcutta. The reduction of id. adopted on the 3d of December last has therefore been rescinded. This alteration is equal to 2 per cent., and, as it is greater than that which hasjust been telegraphed as having taken place in India, it will have the effect of bringing silver into proportionately increased demand. Silver has been in great request to-day, and to meet continental purchases about 20,0001. of gold was taken this afternoon from the Bank. The examination in bankruptcy yesterday of a number of the shareholders of the Royal British Bank who refuse to pay the call made on them of 501. per share furnishes another extraordinary illustration of the way in which the wost results of the failure of that establishment are being aggravated by the operation of law. The original paid up capital of the bank was 50,0001., but some years after its formation this was inereased to 100,0001. Many of the persons who were induced to subscribe the second50,0001. nowpleadthattheirmoneywasobtained by false representations ofthe most scandalous kind on the part of the manager and directors, and that, as the original shareholders must be responsible for the acts of their officers, those who were thus entrapped, so far from being liable to make good the deficiencies of the Bank, are actuaUy entitled to set up a claim upon it for the sums thus fraudulently obtained from them. There are evidently many grounds on which this argument can be supported, and thus anew field of litigation is opened up, which, like the others, promises to be interminable. This plea, however, is not the only one on which payment of calls is resited. One of the shareholders yesterday observed, " A call of 751. per share has been made by the official manager, a call of 501. has been made by the official assignee in bankruptcy, and a call of 501. was made by the directors of, the Bank just after its stoppage. He was so con-c founded that he did not know what course he ought to take, which call ought to be paid, or to whom he ought to pay it." Another said he had been told by the solicitor for the official manager that if he paid the call of M01. to the Court of Bankruptcy he would compel him to pay It again. Probably the question as to where the money should be paid has been placed by recent decisions beyond doubt, but, after what has been witnessed, it is natural that the shareholders should be unable to feel the slightest security on the matter. All they know is that a multitude of professional gentlemen, all well acqanted with the engines the law places at their osal, are scrambling for those assets, uipon the amount of which depends the question to hundreds of needy persons of artial or utter ruin, and that if the liquidation could have been quietly managed by half a dozen practical merchants, the whole might have been speedily realized, and compromises effected as regards the liabilities of shareholders, so as to take off all the worst features of the disaster. The advices from Constantinople to-day state the names of the successful applicants for the concession of the National Imperial Bank to be as follows:Sir Joseph Paxton, M.P., Messrs. Cayley, M.P., Ewart, M.P., the Hon. Henry Coke, x Hunter, Laing, M.P., Scholefield, M.P., Fernie, Jackson, M.P., Chowne, Darby, Brassey, Uzielli, and Rixon. A large continental combination also will, it is stated, most probably be effected. At a meeting of Venezuelan Bondholders, held today, Mr. J. D. Powles presiding, resolutions were passed authorizing the Spanish American Committee to withdraw from further negotiation with the commissioners lately arrived from that republic, and to despatch a conimissioner to Caraccss to arrange terms with the Government. It was stated that after the meeting of the 22d of December the committee had an interview with the commissioners, when it was agreed that the arrangement as proposed m the resolutions passed by the bondholders shiould be adopted. An agreement was accordingly, prepared, in which the details were exhibited. Instead, however, of sanctioning the contents of that document, the commissioners returned another agreement, in which they proposed to make a settlement on a new basis, requiring also a surrender of the old bonds and an issue of new. With regard to the revenue to be appropriated to the bondholders, it was demanded that after the payment of the dividends any surplus should be carried to the account of the Government) while other objectionable features were suggested in connexion with the conduct ofthe agency on this side. Under these ci-rcum- stances the committee intimated their disappointment, and announced their determination to call a meeting requestiig the attendance of the comnissioners. Although the commisioners were not present, M. Urbaneja had addressed the following letter to the committee:- " Translation. "FISCAL Coarssrox OF YV=EZUR " London, Jan. 12, 1857. "4Sir,-I have the honour to address rayself again to the committee resumig and improving the propols for the arrangement of the debt of Venezuela.

"I am, Sir, yporsDespectfrR. "To the President of the Committeof American Bondholders." It was explained that it is evident the coznmhssio.ers desired to effevt a permanent rangement of tho debtt, aa that they were not prepared to adhere to the basis agreed upon; an evasion especially discreditable, since the course to be folloswed to the year 1862 had been clearly defiled, and Jn opportunity would then be afforded of again reviewing the finances of the country, and agreeing to an ultimate settlement. Tne great majority suDporbed the views of the coramittee; and resolutjins expressing disappointment at the conduct of the commasroners were unanimously carried. The commsittee having been authorized to despatch a commissoner to represent their interests at Caraccas, it wans agreed to apply for the support of Lord Claretsdon, the violation of faith exhibited being of a flagrant character. The prospectus has been issued of the British Agricultural Company, with a capital of 100,O9l1., in ll. shares. The objects are to supply guaranteed manures, and to establish a depot for the sale of all descriptions of agricultural implements, as well as of seeds, oilcake, and the various articles used in the feeding of stock. A contract has been made with the Javel Manure Company of France for the exclusive right to sell their artificial guano in England and the colonies for 21 years. Several certificates regarding the properties of this manure accompany the prospectus, some of which attribute to it qualities equal to Peruvian guano, although it is much cheaper. It is a patent manufacture from the ceaspools and slaughterhouses of Paris. The following letter embodies a retrospect of efforts to amenrd the law regarding the pledging of goods, and suggests the practical course to be pursued in the movement which has grown out of the decision in the case of " Kingsford v. Merry :."- g-ae an. 12. "Sir,-We are told by lawyers that the case of I'Kings. ford v. Merry' has not been rghtly understood, and that it did tnot turn uponl the question of negotiability of "I think thatprobably it is IO ;butthe late discussionsin your paper have one good service, by urgently calling the attention of mercantile men to the law regarding hypothecation of goods, which law, though greatly extended by the new Factors Act of 1842, was left at that time incomplete, notwithstauding the struggles made to remedy those imperfections of the law to which the public attriautes the unjust result of ' Kingsford v. Merry.' With the aid of my friend Mr. Lavie, and in co-operation with some valuable mercantile men in Liverpool, advised by Mr. Duncan, and by united perseverance (after two years' struggle, begun in 1840), we were able to carry the new Factors Act in 1S42, in sDite of great opposition. "We succeeded sn convincing 'Lord Clarendon, the then President of the Board of Trade, who gave us great 3sdstance, and the measure, as approved by his Government, was handed down, and at once adopted by Sir Robert "It is the xperience which I had of the difficulties at that time which induces me to believe that some good may be done in explaining how the law really stands, and in suggesting how it is to be extended. "I may premise that up to 1824 every pledge of goods by any one except an owner, unless expresaly authorinzed by him, was illegal. "By the valuable exertions of Mr. Freshfield, now memberfor Peurhyn, an act was passed in 1825 in extension of a previous ct in 1824, whereby pledges by agents intrusted with property were made valid, and agents intrusted with warants or other documents of title were to be held as true owners, unless there was a notice in either ease that the party pledgmng was a mere agent. "The samelaw gave validity to sales of goods by agents, though known to be agents, if made in the ordinary course of business. " The struggle in 1840 was to extend this act, and if we could have succeeded to the length of our wishes we should have put bills of lading, warnants, and all documents representing goods on the same footing as banknotes, bills of exchange, and other documents representing money. " You are aware that a btoiule discounting or taidng in pledge of a bill of excbnge not peCally endorse, bar note, or India bond, is binding on the true owner of the bill, &c., though it may have been obtained by the possesor by fraud, and even by theft. " I have understood that by the old law of England a purchase of goods in vlhat the lawyers call ' market overt' was valid though the goods were stolen, but this was modified afterwards by the true owner having a right of recovering the property on the conviction of the thief by the owner's prosecution - but losas on secwity of goods were never similarly privil a ed "NotwithstandingI= our efforts, we could not get protection to the bond fide lender, on the faith of the docunents or goods, unless the borrower was in some way sutrusted by tho true owner with the documents or goods. "We have since 1842 made progress in getting rid of all prejudices against pledges, and the present feeling evidently shows that the time has arrived when we may hope to have validity given by act of Parliament to all bond fide advances on the faith of goods or documents, without regard to the title of the borrower, which, I repeat, is only putting goods, and documents representing goods, on the footing of documents representing money. ' I feel confidence (and not without sufficient ground) that if a well-constructed act be submitted to the present enlightened Vice-President of the Board of Trade, Mr.lowe, it wll be supported, and even adopted by the Government; and I am sure that it will meet with the approval of the mercantile community throughotut England. "I conclude by venturing to suggest that, instead of occupying time by needless discussions as to whether the case in question was wrongly or rightly decided accordingto existing law, we should, as practical men, apply our energies to get rid of the old-fashioned doctrines of law which must alwas interfere with the exigencies oE commerce, and that the merchants^, bankers,. and brolersat the. meeting on the 19th, or if a PUblic meeting be considered not necessarv should at once get such a bill prepated as they think would mooet the approval of Government. "IaAm, Sir, your obedient servant, " JAMES 6KOK." Subjoined is another communication on the same subject, calculated to direct attention to the real pomts at issue, and to prevent the question from teinng ased upewithtlegal ubtletieus:- si or,-Ase aed merchant, I well remember that about the year 1823 or 1824 a legal question occurred tery simiLar to that of hengpeord v, fmerry,' to which you have in your recent city articles very properly called public atten- oAt that time the transactions in warrans wvere quite trieling as compared with the present; hut so important wasit considered by the mercantile community of that day that no ambiguity should exist on a subject so vitally ating the operationspof merchants and brokers that an act was shorhly passed, if I recollect rightly, called the Factors Act, purporing expressly to place on a sound and con mon-sense footing the legal position of warrants, and I believe I am correct in stating that until the present time traders generally have confidently considered possession to give to bona fid6 holders of wvarrants unimpeachable right to hold the same irrespective altogether of their antecedent " Not having seen the report of the trial 'KEingsford v. Merry,' in the court of error, I could not (in common, doubtless, with many others) trace inthe pubished communications, the exact plea on which the appeal from the previous Exchequer decision, in favour of the defendant, was based, but from your lucid remarks in yesterday's Times I gather that the whole question in this case, and on which I presume the appeal was founded, is-did the pledger get possession of the warrants in fraud or not? If yes, the Curt of Error decides that the defendants, Messrs. IMrry, cannot holdlthem, though under specific advance; if no, that they can. " It is often remarked that if lawyers had less to do with passig acts of Parliament, and those on whom the bear more, commercial law would be aU the simpler -aid I regret to see that legal quibbles appearlikely to invoIve this very simple question in entanglement. " It appears tome that the proposed meeting has practicaly to consider only two points:- "1L The legal status of dock wlarrants being most important to all connected with commerce, and it appearing that considerable uncertainty exists on the subject, 1S it, or is not, the opinion of the meeting that a simple legislative enactment to settle the question in future is expedient? 2. Is it or is it not, the opinion of the meeting that the trade or the country, as well as the equity of the case, Will be best served by enacting that the innocent holder of warrants shall have legal possession, whatever may have been the antecedent circumstances regarding them ? My experience in conuexion with this subject leads me to foresee that if any loophole or ambiguity be left borrower and lender wll be equally inconvenienced and injured, and that in the case of irregularity or failure on the part of anyone having had to do writh a warrant, in any stage of its cxistence, forensic subtlety will raise innumerable compllcatione, and commerce wil have another branch of its operations subjected to the glorious uncertainty aud (to lawyers at least) the glorious costliness of the law. "When it is considered how gigantic is the value an- luaslY rePresented by warrants, how favourite a security it has hitherto been, and justly so, with capitalsts, and how important it is that every encouragement should be given to the emplo ent of British capital at home rather than abroad, I feel sure that I shall be excused for endeavouring, hbbwever imperfectly, by the aid of your colum ns, to keep the real point at issue before the publc. I, J n. re in Sir, your ob edient servant At the Court of Bankruptcy to day a petition to annul the bankruptcy against the Royal British Bank was presented on the behalf of Mx.

STATE OF TrADE. MANCHESTER, JAxi. 13. The market is exceedingly flat to-day. The reaction int the cotton-market is inducing buyers to hold back, in the expectation that goods will be chea er, and in additionL to this commercial advices from India and the news from China are exercisini an uinfavourable influence.

FOR?Ia.LV INTELLIGXGYC. . FRANOE. tA portion of ci'eioUowing Apad in our Mecond edition of yesterday:-] (FROM OUR OWN COlRESPON-DNT.) PARIS, MO'NDAY, JAr. 12, 6 P.r. In the accounts recently given of the Neuchltel affair in the French papers there are some errors, few'but not unimportant, which it may be ss well to correct. The real state of the question at the present moment I believe to be this :-The Federal Council agree to the liberation of the prisoners, not on the demand of the King of Prussia, but in tke ,exercise of the Sovereignty of the Conwfederation. The French Government previously engages to use all its influence with the King of Prussia for the remminciation of the claims or rights specified in the Treaty of Vienna and the protocol of 1852, and for the e7tire indepen,dence of Neuchatel. The words " the exercise of its sovereignty" and " entire independence" wererequired bythe Federal Council to be inserted on agreeing to the liberation of the prisoners. In the exercise of that "sovereignty" not merely the prisoners, but all who are inculpated in the charge of insurrection, or who were to be tried by default, shall be previously removed from the Swiss territory, and kept so removed until the affair shall 1- comDletely and definitively settled. The fact of W.;h removal is in itself a proof of the inadependentl of the Confederation. If it had no right to try the prisoners it could have no right to banish them, for however short a time. There is no doubt whatever, I believe, of the King of Piussia adhering to these terms. The position of the English Government is different from that of France. England had from the beginning recognized the full right of the Confederation to punish those who took up arms against the *Government of Neuchatel. France didnot, apparently, admit that riaht, if we may judge by the ill-advised article in tbe Moniteur. England conse.quently could not call upon the Swiss to do what was claimed as a right by Prussia, because her doing so would have the appearance of admitting the Royal right. The English Governr ent always respected the high position taken up by Switzerland, and was unwilling to do anythinz to narrow it. But England will nevertheless use her best efforts, in concert -with France, to obtain the King of Prussia's renunciation in the manner just mentioned, and to which no difficulty is anticipated. Dr. Kern, the Envoy Extraordinary to the Emperor, has already left, as you are aware, for Berne. 'The Conuaittee of the Federal Assembly meets, I believe, to-day or to-morrow, and the Fede-al As4aembly on Wednesday, when these resolutions will be brought before them. T am aware that the ~Swiss were anxious that England should act pari passu tbroughout with France, and in such case the terms mentioned would have been agreed to unani.nously, or very nearly so. The difference respecting Ingland is, however, more honourable to Swiss independence; but the fact of any difference in the 2ction of the two Governments may lead to a discussion in the Assembly in a few days. Of the final -acceptance by a great majority no reasonable person, as far as I can see, entertains a doubt. The question being in this satisfactory state, it can hardly be dismissed without a word of praise to :Switzerland. At a moment when Great Britain has braved everything-the loss of her alliance, and the renewal of war-rather than give up a jot of what she considered as her right, or tolerate the smallest evasion of the Treaty of Paris-Englishmen, while feeling all the legitimate pride of the position they ccocupy, will not fail to admire the noble and "courageous spirit of a small State, which was ready for any danger in defence of its independence. The conduct of the Swiss cannot be too highly eulo-gized. Without boasting or menace, without fanJ'aronnade of any kind, the Swiss stood by their light, and prepared to maintain it at any cost. The dangers that menaced them were greater than are supposed. Tessin would, in case of war, be occupied ty Austria, and Geneva most probably by France, while a hostile armywouldbe in their front. Switzerland ought to be grateful to the King of Prussia, for his conduct has brought out that country in admnirable relief before the eyes of Europe. There was an immense crowd assembled to-day at the. Church of St. Etienne-du--Mont to witness -the purification. The ceremony was performed by the Bishop of Evreux. At half-past 9 this morning the Metropolitan Chapter, under the direction of the Archdeacon of St. G6n6vieve, left that church and proceeded in silence to St. Etienne-du-Mont. The ceremony ce-mmenced by blessing the water. After that the Miserere was chanted. While this psalm was being sung the Bishop of Evreux -commenced a procession round the church. Bis Grace then blessed the salt, the ashes, and the -vine. After the litanies the psalm Rxsicrgat Deus was sung. Then the Bishop, accompanied by the clergy, walking in procession, sprinkled the church with holy water. The procession stopped at "the entrance of the nave, where the crime was committed, and the whole congregation on their knees -chanted three times the Para, Dwnine. The Holy Sacrament, which had been remoyed from the church, was then brought back and placed upon the -altar. Masswastben celebratedbythe AbbeSurat, which concluded the ceremony. Among the candidates believed to have the best -chance of succeeding to the vacant see of Paris the names of Monseigneur Salines, Bishop of Amiens, <ex-Legitimist, but present Bonapartist,) and Monseigneur Mazenod, Bishop of Marseilles, are mentioned. The latter is said to have the best -ehance. As he is in years, the young Prince Canino (son of Prince Charles), who has been lately ordained priest, and who, I presume, is to be the Car-dinal Fesch of the second Empire, is spoken of as likely to be his coadjutor. It is probable that a wish may exist at the Court -of Rome to make the public believe that the -murderer Verger is insane. It is certain that -among several of the lower orders the crime has produced an effect unfavourable to the clergy, and I have heard of one or two priests being insulted in the streets. Such conduct, unjust as it is, proves at -all events the sympathy felt for the deceased. It is reported that a letter was found on Verger addressed to the E3mperor personally, and which was immediately given to His Majesty. The conclusion is said to be, "L'Archeveque est perdu, gare 'a vous." Verger is also said to have left at his late rectory in .the diocese of Meaux a sort of testamentary paper, which has been transmitted to the police by the Bishop. The paper says, " Je l6gue mon amc iN T'immortalit6, mon corps a la guillotine." (" I be<queath my soul to immortality, my body to the guillotine.") The exhibition of the Archbishop's remains was -curtailed by two or three days. The crowds were becoming more numerous each day ; the language -was, in several cases, not at all edifying; and the police did not think it advisable to allow the exposition to continne on the Sunday. The embalming also was a failure; because, while they used the Gannal process, they also had the idea of -extracting the heart from the body, and mortification ensued. A letter from Spain of the 7th says that the Narvaez Cabinet has not gained much permanent strength. It is certain, however, that in its language and acts the Court is much more prudent than it was. I am glad to be able to mention that improvement, and also to add that so far as morality is concerned there has been for some time past a conziderable change for the better. A second letter of the same date states as follows :- "The situation of the Government becomes each day more embarrassed. A communication has been recently rcceived from the Captain-General of Catalonia ivinhz some particulars of the critical state of that provinee What takes place there is common throughout Spain, mamely, that the authorities, instead of preventing conflicts, are too often among the first to provoke them. Five or six respectable citizens of Barcelona have been arrested by order of the Captain-General, simply because they preppred to take part, legally, in the municipal elections. The act was so arbitrary, so unjustifiable in every respect, and was likely to produce such unplewant consequences, that they had to 1,elsased. All the arrested were friends of General Pri2=>who addressed a letter to them, deploring the treatsment they had met with, and strongly condemning it. The letter was published in the Iberia, but its circulation was stopped by order of the Government, and oly a few numbers appeared, and the paper that inserted it has suffered a penalty. Dirctly or its publication a Cabinet Council was called, and it was decided that General Prim should be imprisoned. Primh& ppened to be at theFrench imbasvador's reception the same night, 'where he became aware of the fact. He waa returning home about 2 o'cock-in the mornig with his wlfe, when he perceiled hin carriage wa3 followed by another, which sontained the Mtlitary Governor of Madrid. On Xteppiag out of the carriage this funotionaq banded him a Royal Qrder, whioth ox pressed the ,.reat displeasure with which Her Majesty bad witpnegse the public4tion of the letter, and lsib ordered him to proceed at onoe to await the orders of the Govemment in the Alcazar of Toledo. He was only allowed time to pack up a few articles of clothing. He was soon Itold that a postchaise was at the door, and he had to leave at 3 o'clock in the morning, in company with two officers to guard him. The excitement produced by sach acts of violence is very great, andrwe are not sure that similar Ones may not be repeated at any neoment, at the caprice of the Government. The Patrie announces the arrival at MIarseilles of Peruk Khan, the Persian Ambassador. His suite is said to be composed of 100 persons, among whom are some of the nobility of Teheran, who solicited as a great favour to be permitted to accompany him. His Excellency is expected in Paris tomorrow or the day after at the latest. The fast was rather an idle week among the tradespeople of Paris. The week following New Year's-day is generally employed by the operatives in amusing themselves after their more than usual activity in 'finishing their work for that day. The shopkeepers made but few saleslast week, and they generally complain that the season has not been as profitable as they expected. They say fiuther that purchasers this season have been more parsimonious than usual,; and that low-priced articles have been most in demand. The manufacturers have less to complain of. Several extensive orders bave been received from London, and the last letters from the United States announce that the stock of French goods in that market is exhausted, and that large orders would have been alread'y forwarded thence but for the high prices demanded by the French manufacturers. Theaccounts fron themanufacturing districts in the provinces are not favourable, business being in general suspended in consequence of the Christmas holydays. The building trade appears to be at present the most prosperous, not only in Paris, but in the large towns of France, where a perfect rage for improvemeont appears to prevail in pulling down old houses and enlarging thenarrowand inconvenient street-s. It is hopd in thecommercialworld that when the Bank of France shal increase its discount accommodation the prosperity will become more general. The fall in the price of corn noticed for some weeks past appears to be for the moment arrested. The difficulty the farmers experience in bringing their produce to markcet on account of the snow, and the want of supplies thus occasioned,have-produceda rise in certain localities. Even in Paris there is a slight rise in the price of flour, but buyers show no great eagerness to purchase, and appear convinced that the present rise cannot be maintained. Flour -was dull of sale in the Paris market at the beginning of the week, and the best marks were offered at 77£, but at the close of the week purchasers were found at 78f. and 79f. The accounts received of the g,rowing crops are still favourable, but the farmers regret the return of the moist warm weather, and would wish to see more frost and snow. There was not much wheat offered for sale at the lastWParis market, except a few parcels from Picardy at 41f. and 42f., from Beauce at 42f. and 43f. 50c., and from the Sarthe at 44f. and 45f. 50c. the 120 kilogrammes. Ordinary and inferior qualities were, however, most abundant, and were bought principally by dealers from Lyons, where it appears the stock on hand is light. Accounts from Algiers announce a rise in the price of wheat, which brings in the market 36f. the 100 kilogrammes. 10,000 metrical quintals were bought on the 20th of December by millers from Blidah, Medeah, and Miliana. Considerable quantities of wine continue to arrive at the market of Bercy by the Lyons and Southern Railways, both from the French departments and from Spain. There is a brisk demand forParis, and prices are rising. Good pture wine is particularly sought for in consequence of theimmense quantityof mixed wine with which the market is encumbered. It is not expected that any fall in price will take place until the quality of the next vintage can be ascertained. Old wines are excessively scarce, and rose last week from 50f. to 100f. the tun, according to the quality. There is but little doing in spirits of wine. Spirit distilled from beetroot has been offered at 124f. the hectolitre. A letter, dated St. Petersburg the 2d inst., publisbed in the Pays, states that the greatest possible activity provails in the dockyards at Cm"nstadt. The workshops for the manufacture of machinery are busy day and night. All possible resources are employed to convert the sailing ships into screw steamers. Schools are established for the education of young men to act as engineers and stokers on bcard the steam fleet. A detachment of ship carpenters has been sent to Nicholajewk, in Siberia. The corps of engineers in Siberia bas been reinforced. The Russian Governmient is constructing forts on the frontiers of Siberia. The last letters from Irkutsk state that the Russian authorities maintain a friendly correspondence with the Clhinese.

Matters, I am told, went even smoother at this than at the conference before,so that, if none of those unforeseen obstacles present themselves to which diplomatic affairs seem to be more subject than any others, in tbree more conferences the firman will be settled in its chief points. The subject of discussion was the fifth point of the orginal firman, containing the representation of the smrall freeholders. Youknowwhen theFrenchAmbassador brought forward his amendments at the first conference they were favourably received, and they served as a basis to all the modifications introduced afterwards in the original document. Thus the project of the Porte makes out five classes which are to be represented, namely, the clergy, great Boyards, little Boyards, free proprietors not Boyards, and the towns. In the French modification this division, although in reality the same, has been generalized under threeheads,-the clergy, the representation of landed property, and the representation of the towns. The representation of landed property is again dimvided into three heads,-the great property, small freehold property, and the representation of peasants who are not free proprietors. In the discussion on the small freehold property it was the amount of property qualification required, and the principle of election by two degrees-that is, indirect'election by delegates-which occupied the attention of the last conference. The latter principle was, aftersome discussion, adopted. About the property qualification there was rather a greator difference of opinion, some members of the conference being inclined to extend the franchise and adopt a lower rate than the ten falshes of land, which both the project of the Porte and the 4mendments of the French Ambassador reconmiend. On this point I hear no decision has been comue to, but no difficulty is apprehended, nor indeed on any other subject in connexion -with the firman. It seems as if all parties, freed as they are from the irritation wshich the complication of the Bolgrad affair'had produced, were anxious to exhibit a conciliatory disposition, and. thus to hasten the settlement of an affair which has been already too long delayed. If this conciliatory disposition last$ and if it' is, as may be hoped, transferred with the Commission to Bucharest, itiWll do nior for the successful !r ganization of the Principalities than any decision whichay be taken on theex composition of the Divans, or the proportion in whlich the different olasses are to be represented.' Iudeed, in a country wrhich never bad anytbing worthythename of representatiol, a in em. dit3which; ~moreover, 'ill-only--have - Us- give. an opinion, butt are not to -possess a decisive Vote,. the forms in which those -assemblie3 are to, act is only & secondary consideration, and. everything depends on the spirit which may preside over the discussions of the Divans. It is, above all, Redschid Pasha's merit that this satisfactory change in the dispositions of the Ieptarchy has taken place, and that the spirit of discord which began to show its head on. this question has been allayed. The short-sighted policy of the late Government had compromised the solution of this subject as much as that of Bolgrad. Instead of accepting what had become inevitable, and entering fairly into the obligations imposed upon the Porte by the Treaty of Paris, it tried all kinds of subterfuges to defeat the meaning of the treaty and to prevent the free expression of the opinion of Moldavia and Wallachia on the question of union. Redschid Pasha, as soon as he assumed power, reversed this policy, and gave assurances that his Government neither intended to bar the rights nor had any desire to interfere with the -free expression of the wishes of the Principalities, for all he wanted was to give to Moldavia and Wallachia an organization capable of resisting foreign influences, and to effect this the wishes of the population ought to be as much consulted as the rights and interests of the empire. This fair view taken of the matter by the present Turkish Government has done a great deal to dissipate the clouds which were gathering, and, instead of the angry disputes which were anticipated in the conferences about the firman, we see now only amicable discussions, which are promising for the future settlement of this difficult question. The happy solution of the Bo]grad and S&rponts' Island affair came just in time to strengthen this conciliatory disposition, which all parties.begin to show. Although Redschid Paslha can claim no direct merit in this solution, yet the frank aud dignified attitude taken by the Grand Vizier cannot have been without its influence. If I Rm correctly informed, he took up the ground that his weakness was his strength, and placed his case in the hands of the allied Powers, who had fought and recognized the independence of Turkey, and who conld not but adopt the resolution which was best calculated to insure this end. I wrote to you in my last letter about the new bank project of the Government, and that Messrs. Wilkins had accepted it in the name of their principals, liable, however, to their approval. The matter has been telegraphed to London, and the answer is expected to-day. Messrs. Wilkins came out last spring with full powers to a negotiate an Imperial Bank. The project is entirely English, at any rate as it stands for the present, and as you may see from the annexed list of names who have signed the full powers:-J. PEaxton, M.P. for Coventry; E. S. Cayley, M.P. for the North Riding; J. C. Ewart, M.P. for Liverpool; Hon. Henry Coke, of Holkham; M7xk Hunter, Chairman of the Commercial Bank of London; S. Laing, M.P. for the Wick Burghs; W. Scholefield, MYP. for Birmingham; E. IV. Fernie, merchant, London; W. Jackson, M.P. for Newcastle-under-Lyme; T. A. Chance, of London; Thomas Brassey, of the firm of Peto and Co., contractors ; A. Darby, of the Ebbw Vale Company; and A. W. Rixon, of London. A report names Mr. Gladstone as the chairman of the company. Thus, as far as the respectability of the company is concerned, it is certainly unexceptionable. The question is merely whether theywill take the same view of the Turkish project as their agents here. If they do, certainlyTurkeyean congratulate herself on having much more favourable conditions than she could have expected, for the objection to the project was not that it was bad, but that it appeared impossible that any association could bring together, in the present state of the market, a capital of 10 or 11 millions for a commerdal enterprise with the condition of investing twothirds of it at not more than 6 per cent. To talk about the advantages of a Bank for this country would be useless. The bare chance of such an establishment has added 10 per cent. to the value of the Turkish paper money, and the exchange has gone down from 136 to 127 since the time Messrs. Wilkins accepted the project. A bank project on a European model is a couditio shie qut non for a healthy development of the vast resources which this country possesses. Before this basis exists,and whilethepresentuncertaintyremains, money affairs must always have much more the character of gambhng than of business. This imay suit native propensities, but it is the despair of sound establishments with European capital. It was this disorderly state which constituted, for instance, the greatest difficulty of the Ottoman Bank in the beginning. It had to contend against this vicious system and the whole clique of Constantinople bankers, who made their fortunes by it. The establishment of a Government bank, if it should take place, can therefore only be of advantage to it as to any other enterprise on a European model. Therewill,be of course,no such large profits as the Ottoman Bank madeby the last loan, which, by the recent rapid faU in the exchange, amounts to 10 per cent. by the exchange operations alone, but they will be, what is more important, sure and regular. It is, therefore, only the native bankers of Constantinople to whom the establishment of an Imperial Bank wil be a heavy blow. I say purposely the native bankers of Constantinople, for in the provinces, where the paper nioney is not current, and they have only to do with the lesser evil of the beshliks or debased five-piastre pieces, there is not so much exchange gambling going on as at Constantinople. The best proof of this is the success of the branches of the Ottoman Bank at Smyrna and Beyrout, in both of which places their bills command a premium of i per cent. and more. But all parties, whether interested or not in the establishment of a Government bank, are anxious to see the matter settled one wav or another, in order to get out of the state of suspense in which all commercial transactions are at present. The establishment of the bank, however, in order to be successful, must be accompanied by a thorough revision and enforcement of the commercial code, which exists more on paper than in reality. In every other country liabilities under a bill are considered as different from common debta, and are summarily dealt with. Here both are equally difficult to recover. A man may pay or not pay his bill at the time it is due:; you have only inefficient means of sueing him. The European Consular Chancelleries, with few exceptions, rather encourage than prevent this laxity. Thus, to demands for a protest sometimes weeks elapse before an answer is returned, and even if the protest be at last obtained it is just as difficult to get it executed and make the endorsers pay. Tricks of all kinds are used: the clerks say, "Master is at Stamboul," and nobody thinks the worse of him for his promenade. How is it possible to make calculations in business if you never know when your bilhi will be paid? AUSTRIA. (mROxo 0 OwrV OOBBRSPONDENT.) VIENNiA, J-AN. 10. The Austrian Government fully approves what has hitherto been done by France and England in the Neuchatel affair, and, such being the c, Prussia has no choice but to leave the defini- tive arrangement of her difference with the Sgwiss Confederation to the Powers who were parties to the London protocol. In its despatch of the 28th of December the Berlin Cabinet complains of the "inactivity of the Powers during more than four years," but the Austrians aver that Prussia never expressed a wish that they (the Powers) should again take the matter in hand. Colonel Manteuffel, who arrived the night before last from Italy, will leave for Berlin this evenino, and there is every reason to belieze that Ins success at Venice was no greater than it was here. It is known that Prussian agents in the Danubian Principalities are agitating in favour of the union, and it need hardly be said that the Imperial Government is greatly annoyed'to see a German Power going hand-in-hand with Russiai on the LowerDanube. A despatch fromx Constantinople states that the Russian fleet had anchored in the Bay of Balkan, and occupied come of the islands. In order that the importance of this measure may be properly understood, a few words mustbe said respecting the islands of which mention is made. Theinhabitedlislands in the Gulf of Balkan are three: the largest bears the name of Naphta or Tcheleken; the next in size is the Aidak, 'or Cucuniber; and- the smalle6t is the Dervish island. The three bA ids, wihidh are close to the coast of Turcomanli, willhforin4n excellent stationfor troops thait retorbe sent t60Khiva; On examining, any good map>% jt-r'jill. bs aeen' that 'the distance from the Gqf. ,o,U ,lk&n to KMhivi i about Itwo-thi lea thai it is f01rox_renburg4to Ahe_Jasenrigned_ p£e and that- there is no-, -esert. between- the, ost of the Caspian and Eliiva. - The grrat eert',of K Xharasim is eonsiderably.,outh of the_voad which would be taken- by troops'marching omm the Gulf bf Balkan toM hiya. 1People heiewill not ackno3vledg th'at 'tho moueymarket is in a sickly state, but 'a dispassionate observer cannot* but see that such is the case. The public, both high and low, has been speculating in credit and railway shares in the expdctationofbein8M able to realize large premiums on its multifarionu investments; but so many concessions -have been gapted during the last 12 months that people are girming,,tobe alarmed, and preferto sell atatriflina 10.os rather than- run the nsk of incurring asersous,one. It is generally believed that the dividenda which the Credit Bank will pay for the year 1$56 will be very zmall, but information received frbni persons who are in a position which enables them to forma a tolerably correct opinion- on -the sabject induces me to believe that the ahareholders who have bought at. the present price of 310'will obtain 63 per cent. for their money. The Emp?eror has signea the concession and approved the statutes of the East GalicianI Railroad, but the founders and subscribers, who have formed a syndicate, wUlbe in no hurry to bring their shares into the market, as they will not require. more than 4,000,000 fl. for the work which is -to be done during the next 12 months. The line which the Vienna-$alzburg Railroad is to take is not' yet definitively fixed, as the military authorities manage to throw all kinds of impediments in the way of the unfortunate Board of Administration. It seems to be the wish of the Government to keep the railroad so far from the banks of the Danube that it shall not be within range of artillery. According to the Pesth Lloydl, which is generally wel inforaed on financial matters, the revenue of the State during the first x months of the year 1856 was ,790,000 'w. more than it was during the first half of the preceding year. It is probable that the statement is correct, but still the deficit is likely to be large, as the journey - of their Majesties to the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom cannot but cost a very large sum of money. On the 9th, after having visited sundry public establishments, the Emperor reviewed the zarrison of Verona. As We are told by the official despatch that the Empress was present at the review ia an open carriage, -we must conclude that the weather at Verona is very different from what it is in Vienna, where the mercury in Fahrenheit's thermometer stands at 2.75. After the troops had defiled before the Emperor they manceuvred "in fire." At halfpast 3 o'clock private audiences were granted, and in the evening their Majesties went to the Teatro Filarmonio, where a very brilliant audience was assEmbled. On the 11th the Emperor and Empress will go to Monza, and on Thursday, the 15th, they will make their solemn entry into Milan. Count Buol, who leaves for Italy to-morrow mornn2g will go aU the way by land, by Goriee and Udine, to Milan. As the Anle Councillor, Baron Meyaenberg, accompanies the Minister for Foreign Affairs, it is to be supposed that the diplomatic correspondence between Austria- and foreign Powers will be carried on during the niext three weeks from Milan. A promise made by the Emperor that the pictures purchased by the State out of the Manfrin Gallery should not be removed from Venicegave extreme satisfaction to the inhabitants of that city. The Neapolitan Government has learnt that a couple of hundred men have reached Sicily from Malta, and, as a matter of course, the British Government is accused of having furnished them with the means of making the passage. STATE OF NAPLES. (EroXr OuR OwN conREsPONDEnT.) NAPLES, JAn. 8. My last letter contained a scanty report of the catastrophe of the explosion of the Carlo III., whether proceedinig from accident or design, which has increased yet more the effervescence of the pablic mind. There is very little to correet, I believe, in that statement, but many details may be addedto it. Itso happenedthat both the Royal boxes at San Carlo were filled with members of the Royal family when the explosion took place, and the confusion which ensued must be inaoined. AlU rushed to the corridors, which were in darkness, as the gaslights had been extinguished by the shock. Prince Luigi endeavoured to calm the tumult, but uselessly, and the soldiers on guard wished to stop -all egress, but in vain. Out the people poured into the stteets, which were in darkness,. as the lights were extinguished in a considerable portion of the city. Here there was greater confusion than even within the theatre. Horses frightened had run off with some carriages; coachmen frightened had,,driven away; masters were shouting for their carriages, and the cavalry on guard, riding backwards and forwards, only rendered the disorder yet greater. In those parts of the city where the inhabitants had retired for the night many rushed into the streets in their nightclothes, and in some quarters voices were heard which did not speak of the" Adorato," or the " adorabile Sovereign." One man said to me " I crouched down in my bed and put my hands on my bead, uncertain as to what might come, but yet prepared for all. " Fui, ftl" was heard in some directions, but order was tolerably weU preserved. In the Palace, the windows of which towards the sea were blown in and 3,678 panes broken, the sensation created was profound, An officer who had been summoned by HLis Majesty was advancing towards him when the shock took place. The King observed, " Quest'e ui secoado di cambio" (a second bill of exchange). The queen, who is very near her confinement, fainted. Lieutenant-Colonel Fauss (Comandante of the Carlo Terzo), on hearing the explosion, nearly fell in the streets, and had something like an apoplectic stroke; in fact, as after the last explosion, the glaziers and the doctors profited largely by the catastrophe. It is just to our brave fellows, the crew of the Malacca to recouiit the part they took iu the night's proceedings. No sooner had the explosion taken place than Captain; Farquhar ordered out the boats, and in five minutes they were making for the site of the disaster. Thenunfortunate vessel went down directly, and the crew who were yet alive were hanging by the loose cordage or clinging to the foremast; 25 of them were taken off, and their rapturous gtatitude must have been something uew for our men,: as they kissed their hands and their feet. The Neapolitan boats came up when they were not needed, and the shore boats formed a circle round the site of the disaster, fearing to approach it, lest the powder which was under the water might explode! It is mortifying, however, to think that, in spite of the great assistance rendered by the Mala6ca some absurd partisans of royalty have attributed the accident to the English, and arnong these ridiculous people 1 could name some hang6rs-on of the Court. On board the Malacca preparations- had been made for the reception of the wounded, and the surgical instruments all laid out in case any of the sufferers might need immediate treatment; but as those who were picked up had received no wounis they were landed immediately. It was after midnight that Prince Luigi sent an officer on board the Malacca, to bear the thanks of 'His Majesty to Captain Farquhar for the effective assistance he naa rendered. It would have been gracious and generous, too, had the official journal in its very meagre report acknowledged the assistance of our sailors, but not a word has been said, though they saved the lives of 26 men. Mreanwhile there are those about the Court who can interpret the promptitude of our men as a 'proof of their foreknowledge of what was to happen. All the officers and men of the Carlo III.- who were on shore have been put under arrest. Of those who survived the catastrophe 'it is difficult to ascertain the number, two only ot the victimas having been found, one of 1vhomii was t-he Captain, fasseo, who has left a. wife and. two- children., He was buried on Monday afternoon withott his head or arms. The quantity of powder on board was about 26 cantari, and this was in the magazine, or, as the Neapolitans term it, the *t Santa Barbara" of the ship. Other packages Were to have beemi put on board on the following morning. A.paft of this cargo, too, consisted of 1,000 muskets. Altbgether the material loss amounted -to at least $254,000 The steamer contained four copper lboilers, which' had been put in by an English engineer. . Whether this event is to be attributed' to accident or design admits of'mueh doubt.' in' the. agitated and discontented state of the public mind it; is-iiot 'unreasonable, .perhaps, t6--xttri-: 'bute it to desiign, Were it 'a 0olitary 'faet. it would npt make so strong an' impresfiOn, 'but as~ onat aerie it s;calciiIatli d t alarm the boldest and shake the most wepticaL.

How are these disasters to be accounted for? There is disafrection and discontent and misery enoegh to make men desperate in this country. But let us take the other view of thequestion, audlauppose that they are the result not of design, but of pure accident. On this supposition there must be a mass of incapacity and negligence in the administration of dangerous end delicate matters which it is fearful to contemplate, but not all astonishing to anyone who knows Naples. There is not a man who will not bear me out in saying that in every branch of the Administration there is the utmost corruption and the utmost incapacity. No one know3 it better than the King on the throne, and therefore is it one reason why he trusts no one and at- tempts impossibilities. But this state of things. is but the effect of a cause, and that cause is the blind protection which has been given to men of no standing, no conscience, no talent - men, inshort,who crawl like the serpent on their bellyin the dust4 and shout, while they betray, " Ferdinando Secondo I" All the world knows how Filangieri and Ischitlla. -the one a man of great talent, the other of great honesty-were driven ignominiously from office. A list as long as my arm might be made of even better men, and the consequence is, that His Majesty has surroundedhimself by anaccumaulation of flattery, ineompetency,andhypocrisy,stoncedisgustingandruin- ous. There can beno hope of improvement here if the best men in the country are not enconraged to rally round the King, and if the Eing will not consent to hear and follow the truth. Perhaps it may be too late even to adopt such a step, for the poison of insincerity har descended through socmety and almost utterly corrupted it. This is strong Ian-. guages but not stronger than the circumstances justify. The Court festivities have been put off in consequence of these continued disasters. The Malacca, which was abotit to make a cruise, will not leave for the present, and I must express a strong opiion, and not a solitary one, that in actual circumstances she not only ought not to leave but might be advantageously joined by another ship of war. Fransce has not one stationed here, and very inexplicably has ,sent in one only twice,
DEST1UCrIOZY OF OLD ROCHESTE-B.UDGEX. ROCIIESTER, JTA. 13. The destruction of the first portion of old Rochesterbridge by the Royal Engineers was successfully accomplished this afternoon, under the general direction of Colonel H. Saudharn, Director of the Royal Engineers establishment at Brompton Barracks, Chatham, in the presence of Lieutenant-General Sir Charles W. Pasley, CO.Ba, Major-General Sir Harry ID. Jones, XC.B., Lnd a large number of Engineer officers belonging to that garrison, as well as several scientific gentlemen, who were anxious -to witness the destruction by gunpowder of such immense works. As soon as the demolition of old Rochester.bridge-.which has stood upwards of four centories-was decided upon Colonel Sandham made application to the iroper authorities that the Royal Sappers and Miners and the East India Company's Engineers might be employed in its destruction, as it was considered that the rare occurrence of removing such a huge mass of masonry was one admirably adapted for practising the officers and men of the Royal Engineers in destroying great works, especiaUy as the troops belonging to that branch of the service had given such successful evidence of their skill in the demolition of the immense docks at Sebastopol. The authorities immediately granted the application, and on the 24th of November lst a body of Sappers and Miners, under the comnand of Captain H Schaw, Royal Engineers, who has ever since very ably superiatebded the undertaking, commenced making the necessary preparations for destroying the bridge. For this purpose the engineers commenced sinking three shafts on different piers, which were exqavated to the respective depths of 24 feet, 21 feet, and 15 feet, it being found impossible to sink them any deeper owing to the constant breaking in of the water. Each shaft bad a mean diameter of 4 feet. As soon as the shafts had been completed to the required depth the working parties commenced driving a series of galleries, leading in horizontal directions from each shaft, in which to deposit the gunpowder used in blowing up the structure. The portion of the old bridge destroyed to-day was one of the large piers, near the Strood side, from which the arches and superstructure had been previously removed by manual labour. This pier was f36 feet in length, 21 feet wide, and 13 feet in depth, and was calculated to contain considerably more than 12,000 cubic feet of masonry, weighing 800 tons. From the shaft which had been excavated in this pier sprang six gallerie3-viz., two of 10 feet in length, from the extremity of each of which branched at right angles another gallery of 3 feet in length; there were also two other gaUeries diverging from the central shaft, each 4 feet 9 inches in length, the galeries being each 4 feet deep by 3 feet in breadth, to enable the Sappers and Miners to traverse them. The weight of gunpowder required to be used in destroying this pier was 3001b., consisting of four charges, each of 601b., andtwo lesser charges, each of 301b., one charge being placed in each gaUery. The powder was contained in tin cases enclosed in wooden boxes. The Royal Engineers were engaged at the old bridge during the whole of last night in preparingthegalleries, after which the powder was deposited in the places selected. The operation of " tamp ing" then commenced, which consisted of surrounding the charges with materials to render the explosion ntore effective, and stopping up the head of each of the galleuies vith wet clay. The wires for firing the charges were laid in wooden troughs, to prevent accidents, and, a communication having been effected with each gallery, the charges were exploded simultaneously by means of the voltaic battery, which was under the direction of Captain C. E. Cumberland, Royal Engineers. The wire used for conveying the galvanic spark was the same as used by the Sappers and Miners for blowing up the Royal George a, Spithead. The effects of the explosion were most satisfactory, and the destruction of that part of the old bridge most complete, the large blocks of stone of which it was composed being rent asunder and hurled into the river, the only eight visible to the spectators being a violent upheaving of the water and the disappearance of the large pier. Notwithstanding the immense number of spectators present, the eperations passed off without the slightest accident. There will be another explosion of a still larger portion of the bridge by the Royal Engineers on Thursday afternoon, on which occasion there will be four oharges fired. two of 2501b. each, and two of 1501b. each. His Royal Highness the Dake of Cambridge is expected to be present on that occasion. Colonel H. Sandham, commanding the Royal Engineers, has published a " memorandumt" to the troops, in which he offers his best thanks to Mr. Wright, the engineer of the bridge works, for his ready concurrence in the whole of the proceedings, and also for the valuable assistance he has rendered the troops during the progress of the operations. The whole of the troops belonging to the Royal Engineers and East India Company's service, as well as those of the Provisional Battalion at Chatham, were present to witness the operations.

FOR:KING CLERGY. TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES. Sir,-Your article of to-day on the work of the clergyr shows so intimate au acquaintance with our perplexities that I cannot help suspecting that you were yourself the " friend who drove up" to the parsonage, and hindered the intended visit to " Widow Jones." ]Bnt, among the various matters which your old coUege friend mentioned to you that afternoon he seems to have omitted one, which none, I think, of your correspondents have supplied-the fact that the clergy have no Sundays. To us the day of rest is generally the day of the week which involves the greatest amount of physical and mental strain. And then Monday niorning comes, and the round of -weekday parochial work has to begin agaln. Now, Sir, upon the town clergy at least this continuous wear and tear must act to the detriment of both bodily and mental energy. As a curate in the country, I have had to undertake a tolerable amount of work, both on Studays and in the week; but there, whenever I felt my work telling upon me, a few hoars of hard walking in fresh, purQ, invigorating air proved an unfailing remedy, and I never broke down for a single day. Now, however, things are different. I can't get the fresh air; there isn't any to be had for miles. If I was a layman I migh', at least now and then, avail myself of the privilege of a Saturday return-ticket. As it is, my legs must be satisfied with London pavement and my lungs with London blacks from now till next autamn, when we all try to got a month's rest. Such being the condition of our work-a seven days' round of continuous calls upon our time-you will let me. I hone, add a word about the " frienda" that " drives up.' as it may be, in a cab, or gets out of the omnibus at thi -corner. Is it quite kind, Sir, to hint that I am just to ibeke hands with him, and go on my way? I have not seen him since we were undergraduates at Oxford. Our rooms were on the same staircase, we read the same'book, together for the schools, and we gaw each other every day. He has just secured a week's holyday; he has come up to town from his raral parish, and he gives up half-a-day to find mue out at the other end of London. Surely, Sir, both Widow Jones and you will excuse me, if I go back -.ith him into my house and introduce him to my wife ? We see little enough of old faces. As regards our own visiting, private friends have to give way to paro. chial engagements, and I have now become quite hardened to charges of neglect from old home acquaintance, both in the matter of visiting and of correspondence. You, Sir, even in discharging the function of a censor, have shown such a kindly spirit towards us that I, for one. nm not at all disposed to deprecate your further criticisms. I have no fear of your being too hard on A LONDON INCUMBEN'T. I j an,12.
BIMm RAL WEALTH OF VIaoOlIA.-The select committee of the Victorian Legislatire Council, which was appointed some time since to consider upon and recommend the best mode of developing the mineral resources of the colony, have now given their repoDrt to the public. Although the attention of the eommittee has been direated to every branch of the subject submitted to them, that portion of the report is most interesting which refer- to the working, tho remunerative capabilities, and the extent of the gold mines of Victoria. There is probably still a large numnbr of persons who believe that gold-digging, as at present conducted in the neighbouring colony, is, upon the average, a very lucrative callin. This 2idea, howeover, was shown, in the discussions which took pla upon the gold export duty some time mince, to be erroneous; and the opinion then expressed to that effect is amply supported by the present report. The statistics collected by the committee represent that at the end of last year there were 100,0u0 miners, either engaged in actual mining, or rushing about in mearch of now diggings upon the goldfields of Victoria. Therefore, as the estimated yield of gold that year was 12,50,00OOL sterling, the earnings of each man were not more than 8s.&aday. This issomethingloss than aday laboureres wages in the neighbourn co-lony, to say nothin-gof the uncertainties which attend the occupation of a golddliggger. The committee attribute this circuinstance to the absence, of all regular systens of mining, without which the aggregate yield must not only be smaller, bnt much Iess equal than it otherwise would be. The result of the present uscientific plan of diggi then, is that much of the gold is lost in manipulation, andtc chance of gain is so unequal that while a few persons may realize fortunes thoe relt i ajority ale barely earning a livelihood. With regard to the much talked of roailtofthV traod ldsobecominig exhauste , the committee make out a very pleasant opinionL in favour of their continued richness for no lees a period than 2,240 years!I The statisties gvive on this point ara ti oso of Mr. Brache, who is considered a reliable authority ist such matters He estimxtes the auriferous lands of the colony to be 20,000 squaire miles, including 200 square miles tf quartz-reefs; that there are gli 05. 000,000 tons uf quartz. which would ake 100,0 miners 30 years to work np. The value of this, estimated- as low, as 1i. -per ton, would give -the enormous yield of 02 D,000,00. atelling per annumn, allowing 10,000 companies of 10 men 4each to ouarry and crushi 24 tons a-day. Tihe alluvial lands are further estimated at 20,444,000,000 cubic yards, and if worked up by 100,000 miners at the rate of l9),000.00) cubic yards per annum, tbey would take 2,240'-years, as the tine required for exhausting their treasmures. The grand total of the estimated auriferous wealth of tha puoy stt down at 26 7$3,0,ODOPOI, sterling. To, dovelope th ese enormous ;Ilebe in, something like a. stientinfin anner, tbe comnmitte advises 'that,' thei Government shouldl appoint a contral staining board,_'with corre-spending branches en theprincipalgoldfields.- The duties of those biiar&l woulid be to send otutpractical meri of science to examnine and report upon everything eonnectedwith the mdineral resources of the colony; to publish -a -manual of iiItarnmtion ; and to cause lectures to be delivered to tbe, population icattered ove: the golafieldL.

rlOAVDOZN, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 14, 1857. The plot of the Persian war thickens every maiL The latest news is, that nothing had been heard of the expedition to the Persian Gulf, while the force under Brigadier C{n?sEnRLYxsB had nearly reached Cabul. We must wait for several weeks more before we can learn whether the fleet has reached the iMtended scene of operations, whether aU the ships have joined, whether the object and the plan of attack have beendecided on, whether anything has been done, or whether at the last moment some discovery has been made fatal to success. Only half of the delays and mishaps, the changes of purpose, and divisions of opinion that seem to have been thought nothing extraordinary in the history of the late war, would throw the present expedition late into the spring, and expose it to some of those visitations of PROVIDEcE which are sure to come some time or other. To those visitations, when they come, we are as ready to bow as most people; but we have also the pardonable weakness of wishing to avoid them, if it can be done lawfully, and preparing against their inevitable approach. By the time, however, that the darkness now hanging over t,-' whereabouts and the achievements of the Anglo-Indian fleet has been somewhat removed, we shaU probably hear something of the British force last reported on its way to Cabul. Our policy in this quarter is truly British. First,. it was all to be done by diplomacy and money. DOST MAno.0uuD was to do the fighting, and we were to pulU the strings and supply the sinews of war. Then it appeared we were to contribute a military head; to this was added a contingent; and by and bye it turns out that while the Affghans have merely been vapouring, or at least skirmishing, without any serious intention, the British head and contingent are expected to do all the work. For aught we know, by this time Brigadier CHANun. LAYvN may have passed through Cabul on his way towards Herat, and may already have suffered the usual consequences of such a march among such capricious allies. Such is the uncertainty inevitable to operations of which the intelligence must travel eastward thousands of miles to India before it can begin its passage of 10,000 miles from India to this country. But about the same time that in the natural course of things we are beginning to hear of the success or the failure, the operations or the inactivity of the expedition, we shall also be enabled to ask, with some chance of a reply, what is its real origin? We have already animadverted on the manifest absurdity of Herat being the real object of the war, on the strangce treaty said to have been made with Persia four years ago, on the utter unimportance of Herat, on the impossibility of obtaining from Persia any security for leaving Eerat unmolested, and on the folly of going to war every five years with some Power or other on the pretence of checking the schemes of PRussia in the East. But is Herat really the cause of the war ? Why, at this very raoment there is going on in this metropolis, and among all circles pretending to be -well informed on political affairs, a faree as broad as anly that ever appeared on the stage. While the newspapers and correspondents and officials, with patriotic decorum, are assuming that Eerat is the cause of the war, there is not a company in which it is not stated as ? matter of notoriety that the real cause is that iidiculous quarrel about a Persian lady. As the quarrel has been related in the language of diplomacy, and as it will soon be in the blue-books, we need only repeat the principal fact, that the British Minister bad the indiscretion to extend the British 2ei to . i d- by ao lay, of indiffeidnt -haracter, claimed by a memib of the 3Persian Court; anid lok his refusing to give up the lady to the outraged feelings and the violated law of the country had h himself, as a maatter of course, to retire from it. We are told that first-rate Oriental authorities, with a full Inowledge of the case, have declared that the British Minister was unquestionably wrong, and that Persia had no alternative but to do as she did. Whether this be so or not, it is at least in everybody's mouth that it is not Herat, but a frail fair one, who is the true cause of the war. The nation is saying one thing in public and another in private; and, while the broadsheet at brealkast proceeds on the solemn supposition that it is all about Herat, the talk of the dinner-table equally takes for granted that it is about a Persian courtier's runaway mistress or wife, and the Quixotic protection extended to her by British officials. In fact, it is only another version of the old story, the primeval rupture between the Orientals and the Westerns. But as the British public, fortunately for their own virtue and happiness, have not seen the lady in question, and only know of her attractions by hearsay, they can listen to reason, and ask, whether this be indeed the cause of the war; and whether, if it be so, the British Government is prepared to maintain that they have the right on their side, and that Persia was not justified in quarrelling with the Hon. CH:RLBs MuB}Y. No one, of course, can reply to these questions with a tone of authority, except " from the book," and we do not pretend to know what has been carefully kept from our knowledge. So we only say what we are told. We are told, then, on very good authority that, as for Herat, the Persians have offered everything we could decently demand,-to restore it to the Affghans, and to compensate the inhabitants of that place for their losses by the siege. We are assured they declare their wish to be on the best of terms with us, but that our Government makes a point of resisting all their overtures unless they will also be on good terms with Mr. CHARLEs MUHRAY. It is certain that Persia has been making the greatest endeavours to propitiate us. FERuK KA, who has been at Constantinople trying to satisfy Lord STRATFORD of the justice of his cause, and who is now daily expected at Paris, offers, we are told, full satisfaction for the capture of Herat, and full explanation as regards the dismissal of our M1inister. Indeed, we are not without hope that the quarrel may be made up. But, so long as it goes on, it is producing its natural fruits. The SHAH, driven into hostility, and forced to defend himself by every means in his power, has applied to Russia, only too ready to give its aid against its worst foe. Persia hitherto has been not so much a positive Power, and a real weight in the scale of politics, as a neutral ground between us and our rivals, opposing a certain degree of tis iiwltvz against their designs. Instead of being content with this very useful service, which was all that we wanted, we are driving Persia into the arms of Russia, and maling her an active inxtrument, perhaps a dangerous one, in the hands of that aggressive and long-sighted Power. This is to play the game of Russia, and that for no reason that we can imagine, not even for the vices of Kings, the old source of war, but for the folly of a British representative.
The author of E.therw may always be sure of commanding the attention, even when he fails to obtain the suffiages, of a constituency. Nor will his claims on such attention or the numbers of his auditors be diminished when he takes for his text the pleasing theme of the inferiority of the governing class to the persons whom he addresEes. Facile apnud Athenieses Athenam laudare. It would not be difficult for a less accomplished candidate than Mr. KnMGLAKE to excite sympathy and applause by a profession which must appeal so strongly to the self-love of his audience. Mr. K. GLAjs creed is thus enunciated "I am strongly of opinion that the high offices of "this country are unduly distributed among per"sons of particular families, and belonging to a "particular class in society, without due regard "to their qualification for holding them. "And what is the result ? Why, that "in a country abounding in intelligence "and business-like power there is always "one firm that is breaking down, and "that is the firm of the Government." And upon this theme Mr. KxEc"ica dilates at length. It is undoubtedly a taking theme, and one that will afford immediate delectation on the spot, even if it produce no material fruits in the end. It cannot be denied that our rulers belong to a caste. They are not all chosen from our S-.rrNs, JoN-ESEs, BRowNs, and RoaiBsoNs. The humblest English peasant may, if he so like it, proudly luxuriate in contemplating the names of the Dukes, MIarquises, and Lords who condescend to do his business for him. He is governed and directed, and has laws made for him, by men whose ancestors were lords when his ancestors were serfs. That is one phase of the picture. But there is another phase. Among the " lordly" class are men whose fathers were, not so very long ago, in his own position; but, of whatever descent, the Lords predominate in the administration, and of the Commoners those who fill the most prominent positions are of lordly stock or lordly affinity. So far a case is made out, and it is one well adapted for the basis of a sentimental grievance. But MIr. KT-aLAKn has overlooked one point to which as a lawyer he could not have been, though as a candidate he might be, blind. The constitution admits of our Executive being supplied only from the Legislative body. We cannot give the Treasury to any leading banker, or the Home Secretaryship to the first country squire or provincial attorney that we meet. The men who govern this nation are responsible to Parliament, and must, therefore, sit in Parliament. It is by their efficiency in Parliament that their fitness for administrative posts is tested. If there are more men of aristocratic birth in the Executive, it is because there are more of that class in Parliament. Perhaps this is wrong, and to be regretted and amended. But it is a fact. There is a very large proportion of this class which came into the House of Commons before the Reform era and has continued to legislate ever since. Some of these men remain in the House of Commons; others have gone to the Lords. But, whether in the Lords or the Commons, their long political career has, given an amnount of political experience which must make men who are willing to turn it to use almost indispensable in forming a Government. If we admit it as a grievance that these -men are not selected indifferently from all classes of ociety, we must blame the constituencies, and not the constitution. We may argue that the. Jords ought not to monopolize an Administration,+ut we must admit also that, if they devote the;selves to public business, they ought not to be excluded from all share in administration. We do not wish-and we preaume Mr. XnGLAr.&Z does not wish-to reduce them to the condition of Spanish Grandees and Italian Principi. If the country wishes to be governed by another class of n:en it must send another cliss to Parliament. But re 'we quite sure thit, in such an eveit, it would -be. govehmed better t We are willing to concede all that. the most clamorous agitators will tell uiabout-theignorance and ineapacity of certain. heads of departments. Of many of themnot ia this or in any one particular Mini4try1 buxt in all alike-we can truly aver that they are sin. gularly unfitted for their special duties. Men whom occasional business or official ties have made conversant with the machinery of different departments have hundreds of stories to tell respecting the wondrous ignorance of their chliefs. This is all true. But with a different race of men are we at all sure of getting a superior class ? Under any circumstances the heads of our Administration must be, to a certain extent, speakers and debaters. This is their first indispensable qualification. Are the men of great and solid acquirements sure of recommnending themselves to the suffrages of the electors throughout the United Kingdom T Is a man of special and profound knowledge and thoroughly qualified for departmental administration likely to be always equally well qualified for Parliamentary debate? Mr. KINGLAKE urges the reproach that " in a " country abounding in intelligence and business " power" the Govermment should be the only firm always breaking down. Now, it seems to us that recent events give to this complaint the appearance of irony. Certainly a retrospect of the last year does not enable us to triumph in the superiority of commercial integrity or commercial adroitness over the integrity and skill of the Government. The middle classes of this country have a vast field of administration in their banks, railways, and jointstock companies. Knowledge, economic and financial, vigilance, method, and integrity are as indispensable on their part as on that of anyGovernment. Yet how often within the last twelvemonths -to go back no further-how often have the maost critical difficulties and distrens been caused by the absence of these very qualities in associations created and controlled by the mercantile classes ? What reason is there for supposing that the government of the country would be better carried on if it were confided to the hands of such men as administered the property of the Crystal Palace, directed the management of the Great Northern Wailway, or originated that splendid institution the Royal British Bank? is long as we have Parliamentary government we must be governed by Lords and MVLP.'s; and we are bound to say that, judging from experience, the Lords are not the worst element of this kind of government. To the disciusion of great subjects of public interest the Lords bring an eloquence, an argumentative and critical treatment, and a novelty of illustration which a four nights' debate in the Commons does not often elicit. A debate in which Lord LYNDHuEST, Lord DERBY, Lord ELTx.-Botouo;, and Lord GRANVILLE take part is far more interesting than most which the Commons can now-a-days produce on the same subject, and whoever has had to conduct business before them both will admit that the Lords' Committees are at least equal to those of the Conimons. We doubt whether any change which the constituencies are likely to make in the composition of the Lower House will improve the component parts of our Administration. Ever since the era of the Reform Bill there has been, on the part of the towns, a growing tendency in favour of the aristocracy of wealth. The rich retired tradesman, the cornfactor, the woolstapler, and the provincial attorney are at present the ordinary choice of the borough voters. We do not quarrel with such a selection, but urely it would be deprecated by none more than by those of whom Mr. KITGLABE may be taken as a type-men whose high intellect and fastidious refinement at the same time qualify them for pronouncing on the merits of the candidates for high office, and indispose them to join in a competition too often soiled by an ignoble pursuit of self-interest and an ignoble forgetfulness of self-respect.
In the Court of Comaon Pleas on M£onday last judgment was delivered in a case involving questions of remarkable interest, both to the legal profession and to the public at large. For the greater edification of our readers, we wil strip the matter not only of the personalities but also of the technicalities by which it has been attended, and present the argument in a purely abstract character, and in as popular a shape as its nature will allow. A certain plaintiff claimed a large property, in which proceeding she was opposed by a certain defendant. The cause came on for trial, when, pending the trial, a compromise was agreed to by the plaintiff's counsel on her behalf, to the effect that she should receive a specified consideration, and relinquish her claim. After the transaetion, however, had been thus concluded she refused to perform the agreement, alleging that it was entered into against her intentions, and the question mooted is, whether a client, being represented in a court of law by counsel, is or is not bound by an agreement which his counsel may make on his behalf ? The actual case before us admitted of consideration from other points of view, inasmuch as it was argued-first, that the plaintiff had conveyed a special authority to her counsel; and, secondly, that she had subsequently ratified his tndertakings; on either of which assumptions the position of affairs would, of course, be wholly different, and the particular controversy escaped. The argument to which we invite attention is that which was urged in the third place, and which is very lucidly expressed in Mr. Justice CROWDRR'S judgMent. " It is contended," said he, " tbht without any " special authority previously given, or any subse" quent ratification," plaintiff's counsel, " by tle "Cmtere r1ationaship of coumsel to Ihis Clieot, was " invested witlh a general agency, arising from " their relation as partners, and with authority to " bind her by any agreemont he might in his dis"cretion enter into on her behalf while conduct"ing the cause in court." So broadly, in fact, had this general proposition been maintained, that the case was actually assimilated in argument to that of " partners in trade, where a general agency " arising from their relation as partners makes "the acceptance of a bill of exchange by "one binding upon the other in favour "of third parties, although in the parti"cular instance the authority may have been "expressly revoked ;" and it had been insisted that, even if the plaintiff "had come into "court during the negotiation, and expressly pro"hibited her counsel from proceeding, yet, unles "she gave notice of her prohibition to the opposite "party, she would have been bound by her ooun"se's signature to that agreement." Well indeed might the learned Judge observe that such an argument !' introduced a question of very general " and grave importance, far beyond the partieular " merits of the present ease." If such a doctrine, in fact, could be conclusively established, every person going to law would be delivered over bound hand and foot to his lawyers,, without any right of -private judgment, except such as he had been at the pains previously to reserve, and the surest way, apparently, for a man to protect his own interests would be by pleading his own cause. On behalf of auch a doctrine it seems to have been urged, with a very natural consideration for the dignity and convenience of the profesion, tbat unless clients were 'spposed to be thus, as it were, bodily represented by their counsel the business of courts could not boe carried on nor justice administered according to the Enlglish ussae I betwveen nman and man. The parties to a suitmil be presumed to be actually pr,*ent; that thej'.axe present only in the persons of eertain reprwonQa tives is owing to a praetice wheh expotiege6d Im proved to be most eondiceive to thoner kint6rkt of right and order; but if thlee repre entativoa are not to enjoy liberty of- iction-if what they do i8 to be'undbne by those who have authorized their agency, it is obvious that. the operations of the I law would be nullified and aU its labour thrown away. There is, undoubtedly, much plausibility, and, indeed, some groundwork of truth, in this argument, but it was overtlurown, we think, completely by the perspicuous reasoning of Ir. Justice CROWDER, and reduced to dimen 6ions more conformable to common reason. The agency of counsel must be finally accepted on all points within the comnpass of lis ordinarq functions, but not beyond. The general management of a cause, the choice of arguments, the line of conduct to be pursued, are all matters remitted to his absolute discretion, and he in his judgment must determine them as he thinks best for his client. Up to this stage of the controversy all are of one opinion; but has the counsel any title to overstep his ordinary functions without special warrant, and, if he has not, is such an overstep taken when, in the place of fighting out a cause, he enters into a compromise? No doubt, compromises are incidents of well known oci4rence in suits-at-law; but are they not also tridactions of a kind needing in all cases a special authority ? We do not undertake to say how far such a question may be affected by precedent, or in what light such a point may be regarded as a rule of the Bar, but we very confidently predict that Mr. Justice CROwDER wiU carry with him the opinion of 19 readers out of 20 when he remarks that, " taklng " the present case as an example, it would seem a "strong thing to hold that counsel receiving a "brief from a plaintiff, . . . . . to try "whether there was a valid devise of a "large estate to her, has incidentally an im"plied authority to decide that his client shall "agree to waive the question, and give up all claim to the estate upon receiving a certain annuity for life." Of course it may be held that even in such a case he would be doing neither more nor less than he was engaged to do, and that his assent to the agreement would simply assume that the compromise was the very best result his client could obtain. This, however, is a point which the vast majority of men would prefer to keep for their own decision, and it is one, moreover, which we think few suitors would conceive themselves to have committed to the judgment of their counsel. " A client;" observed NMx. Justice CBOWDER, " might think a "particular barrister an excellent advocate, and "therefore employ him, but might have no confi"denee in his power as a negotiator of terms of compromise." Even as regards the convenient administration of justice, the learned Judge was successful in showing that no great advantage could ensue from investing counsel with these extensive rights of agency; for in such event it would become " necessary in every case "in which the client is determined to try "his cause out, not only to give special in"otructions to his counsel to make no compro"mise, but also to notify to the opposite party "that he has so done, or else to be personally pre"sent at the trial, in order to be ready at a "moment's notice to withdraw his brief from "counsel, and thus revoke his authority. This "would surely be attended with much inconve"nience, and would be alike disagreeable to coun"sel and client." On the other hand, if a client designs to include a compromise in the contingencies of a suit, what can be easier than for him to give "special instructions" to this very effect ? We should think that the clear and well-reasoned judgment to which we have been adverting will have great weight on a point where precedents do not seem to be either abundant or decisive. For ourselves, looking at the question rather in a popular than a legal light, we must say that we do not think it either reasonable or expedient that the employment of legal aid should be presumed to include the forfeit of personal authority, and that litigants should be compelled by proxy to shake hands against their will.

BAKEK CHABTBR ACr. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The reasons have been already set forth on which we may confidently anticipate that the existing settlement of our monetary system will be firmly mlaintained. The steady force of sound principles, the clear deductions of scientific reasoning, the 'emphatic verdict of experience will not be hastily overruled. These considerations-each separately powerful, but derivingirresistible strength from their coincidence-must command the assent of the Government, of Parliament, and of the public. The safety of our monetary system will not again be exposed to the unregulated or haphazard operations of multiplied private issuers, acting, of course, under the influence of competition, and naturally consulting -only their own interests; neither wil any one great public body be intrusted with the dangerous power -of creating money at its own discretion, and extending or contracting the amount of the circulation uncontrolled by any fixed rule. The act of 1819 afflrmed the principle of restoring our paper money to,its just and honest value; the act of 1S44 has gi'L4-us effectual ecurity for the faithful maintenance of that value-noble records to be iuscribed -on the statues which public gratitude is now raising in honour of the author of those measures; and the Parliament of 1857 will not invalidate them -and attach to itself the stigma of having again plunged the country in the monetary confusion and -danger to extricate us from which has required so many painful efforts, so much patient perseverance, and such endless discussions. The fumdamental principles of those measures-namely, the separation of the issue and banking departments, and -the estire suppression of discretionary authority over the amount of the paper issues-will be maintained. The repeal of the act of 1844, and a return to the incomplete system of 1819, may be regarded as impossible. It would be a most formidable retrograde step towards a suspension, or rather an entire abandonment of specie payments, and would soon termninate in that result. The people of this country are become too wise as regards their own interest, too honest as regards publieprinciple,to tolerate such a suggestion. But modifications of some of theprovisions of theBank 'Charter Act may be suggested, which, involving no violation of its essential character, find favour with those who are fond of change, and therefore think that " something must be done." ILet all such propositions be received for what they-are worth. It is important to understand their real effect, that the value to be obtained may be compared with the -trouble, the inconveniences, and the uncertainty which must attend the change. I will advert to one or two of these suggestions. First, with regard to what have been called the anomalies of the bill-the omission to apply the principle of the biU in its strict form to the country issuers of England and also to the issuers in Scotland and Ireland, and thus to restrict the power of issuing paper money to one body exclusively. This is undoubtedly a departure from the pure principle of the bill, acquiesced in from a regard to practical difficulties, and an unwvillingness to excite, without adequate necessity, the prejudices of important classes rendered more obstinate by a sense of private interest. But has it been found by experience that the anomaly seriously impairs the efficiency of the bill? These issuers are subjected by the biU to some useful and really powerfiul restraint. They cannot nullify its objects, notwithstanding the supposed incompleteness of some of its provisions. The fluctuations of the paper money now really correspond to what would be the fluctuations of a metallic circulation. A drain of bullion we now know by experience is met by early measures of precaution and correction, which are uninterruptedly mnaintained until the necessary result has been secured. The great object of the act-the protection of the bullion reserve, and the certain convertibility of the paper notes into gold on demand, is fully attained under the provisions of the bill as they exist. The attempt to render it more consistent and complete by abolishing entirely the privilege of issue such as is at present conceded to the private banks of England and the great banking companies of Scotland and Ireland may probably give rise to very troublesome discussions, without any adequate necessity or the reasonable prospect of any really important improvement. 2. In the opinion of some persons all private issues, whether by the Bank of England or private concerns, are inconsistent with sound monetary principles, and they will therefore propose that the privilege of issuing paper notes shall be vested exclusively in the Government. This suggestion, how. ever, is exposed to a formidable objection. Great danger may be apprehended from associating in the mind of the people the pressure of monetary contraction with Government responsibility. Weak or dishonest Governments may yield to the pressure to which they will, of course, be subjected, and seek to obviate political difficulties, or to promote their own temporary popularity, by a fatal tampering with the solidity of the system. The law in its present form is exposed to none of these objections. The issue department is subject to no control by the Bank of England or by the Government; the fluctuations in the amount of notes issued is determined by the positive law of Parliament enforcing a great principle; and, as neither Bank of England nor Government is vested with any discretionary power over the amount of notes to be issued, no inconvenient or dangerous responsibility can attach to them. 3. Another suggestion, the plausibility of which may probably command for it the favour of some persons wvho are firm supporters of aU the essential princ.ples of the bill, is that of increasing the amounlt of notes which may be issued upon securities. At prtsent, in addition to the notes issued against the bullion in deposit, notes to the amount of 14,500,0001. are issued against other securities. Some increase of thisamountmnaypossiblybe permitted without any reasonable probability of subjecting the bul. lion reserve to dangerous diminution, and some smaU profit may thereby accrue to the Government. In this, however, consists the whole advantage to be -derived from the change. No absolute increase in -the aggregate amount of the circulation of the -country can result from this arrangement. Whatever increase takes place in the amount of notes issued upon securities, there must be a corresponding decrease in the amount of notes issued upon bullion. The total amount of the circulation Will remain unaltered. The great laws which determine the monetary equilibrium of the commercial world assign to this country a certain amount of money. No internal arrangements to which we may resort -can alter or suspend that law. We may determine for ourselves what proportion of that amount of money shall exist in the form of notes issued upon other security than that of bullion, and what amount shall be issued upon bullion; but beyond this our ^power does not extend. The monetary arrange ments of this, as of every other country, must be subordinate to the great principles which regulate -the monetary equilibrium of the world. Auy attempt to resist or modify the result of these principles can result only in confusion and embarrassment. 4. Objections have been raised against the pro-visions of the bill as they now stand, on the gorounud that the saein correctives are indiscriminately applied to all drainsof bullion-that no attempt is made t%. disriminate and to-treat a, drain of bullion differe:v4y, according to the difieront causes from whicb, it ra. originate. A pres uire upon the exchanges may be caused by, ati excess of -imports arising from over speculation, or by a failure ot the harvest tecessitatiDg large imports of foreign grain, or by a great demand for some article of extensive coiisumption, such as raw cotton, or by foreign expenditure of the Government for warlike purposes, as on the recent occasion. In short, it is impossible to enumerate the endless variety of causes from which a disturbance in the distribution of the precious metals and a consequent drain upon our bullion reserve may spring up. Is it possible, however, to distinguish with certainty between these different causes, and to determine to which of them a drain when it arises is attributable? And, even if this be practicable, will it be wise or safe to suspend our precautionary or protective measures so long as the bullion, from whatever cause, is subject to a continuous diminution? A drain of bullion may arise from the joint operation of several causes; indeed, it is seldom otherwise. Who is to say how much of the drain arises from one cause, and how much from another cause? Such a distinction is atterly impracticable. The exclusive purpose of the act of 1844 is to make our paper money correspond in amount and in value with what, in the absence of paper issues, would be the metallic money of the country. Any attempt to do more than this is held to be unsound and dangerous. A drain of bullion, whatever the cause of it, would produce a contraction of metallic money; it ought therefore to be met by a correspending contraction of the paper money. We have heard much of the II management of the circulation." It is, perhaps, an unfortunate expression, as upon the use of it appears to depend in some degree the fallacy we are now discussing. There ought to be no management whatever of the circulation. It must be left to regulate itself by the free action of the public paying in or drawing out gold, while the issue department confines itself to the mechanical duty of issuing notes as the gold is paid in and cancelling notes as the gold is drawn out. This is the simple principle of the act of 1844. Here let us pause and calmly survey the grounds upon which these modifications of the bill are recommended to our confidence. The act in its present forrm has been found sufficient for its great purpose-the protection of the bullion reserve, by means consistent with the stability of commercial credit and the progress of industrial prosperity. The bullion has been preserved from undue exhaustion, the exchanges have been subjected to sufficient control, speculation tending to a dangerous excess has been restrained, at the same time usefuil enterprise has met with no serious obstruction, industrial pursuits have been maintained in healthy activity, the productive powers of the country have been expanded, while the amount of the necessaries and luxuries of life distributed among the people has been prodigiously augmented. In short, the public, as has been observed with truth, is almost tired of hearing of the soundness of trade. What, then, are the ascertained evils to be obviated, what the certain benefit to be obtained through the introduction of the suggested modifications? It is well that these questions should be carefully considered before we legislate, lest in our attempts to modify the existing law without a clear perception of the necessity of the change, or of the certainty of the advantage to result from it, we should find ourselves playing the fool's game, " Shunning famcied ills and chasing airy good." MERCATOR. Jan. 1857.
THE OVERLAND ROUTE. TO THE EDITOR OF THEI TIMES. Sir,-I venture to assert that at least 19 of every 20 per. sons who have travelled as passengers by the overland roate to India will be found ready to corroborate the statements made in your columns of yesterday in a letter from " An Old Traveller." It is only surprising how patiently the public tolerates the unnecessary delay of the mails between Egypt and India. One instance of it I may mention. I left Bombay on the morning of the 11th of July, 1855, in the Peninsular and Oriental Company's vessel Cadiz. After making a very tedious voyage of 13 days we were detained for five days at Aden until the arrival of the Bentinck from Calcutta, Had the Cadiz gone on to Suez the Bombay mails might have arrived In England five days sooner, We were seven days in the Red Sea; with proper speed we should only have been five. For this portion of the disthnce we paid the moderate sum of 351., or 51. a-day. In the Deeert a report reached us that Austria had joined with Russia against France, England, and Turkey, and we were advised not to think of going by Trieste. Only two went; for, although on arriving at Alexandria we ascertained that the report was false, yet the parties had been made up. The officers of the Austrian Lloyd's steamer Bombay told me that the report had been spread abroad by the agents of the Penindular and Oriental Company to induce the passengers to go by their vessel, which, in consequence, was overcrowded, and I believe met with an accident at Malta. Those who have only travelled in the Peninsular and Oriental Company's vessels as far as Egypt are loud in their praise. Let them go a little further. It seems invariably to happen that there is not sufficient accommodation provided at Suez to convey the passengers to Aden. The Peninsular and Oriental Company have now the monopoly of the routes from Suez to India since they obtained the contract for the Bombay portion of the mails. Their first step was to raise their rates of passage-money enormously. No wonder the shares of the company yield a premium of 12 per cent. If you could awaken any spark of generosity in the breast of the directors you would obtain the gratitude of many who, little able to afford it, are compelled by health or necessity to make the voyage, and of many who, from inability to make it, remain in India-to die. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, EXPOSITOR. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I am delighted to see a growl in your paper aboult the Peninsular and Oriental Company. I can testify from my own experience that their treatment of the unhappy passengers on the other side of the Isthmus of Suez is vile. They have on several occasions had only a rmaH steamer of 1,000 tons, capable of conveying 50 passengers, to carry some 90 or 100 passengers. I will leave to your readers to imagine whait this is (with the thermometer standing at 980 or 100°. If the wrotched inn at Suez is under the management ef the Peninsular and Oriental Company they ought to be asbamed of it and themselves. It is hot, dirty, comfortless; and there is never a suificient supply of food for the travellers, and suoh food as is supplied is very poor. I am, Sir, yours obediently, ANOTHER TRAVELLER.
" UILOOKED FOR COMPLIMEBNT." TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I cannot but exaress a hone that the parava h which appears in Vie limes of th morning under a above heading is incorrect, and that Sir William Codrington, the late and last comnander of our English army in tho field, has not condescended to accept " loot" at the bands of an English sailor. Our army never occupied Yalta, nor was there ever any military or maritime demonstration against that pleasant little sea-coast town, and if the worthy tar "found" a Russian general officer's state sword in any of-the houses of Yalta, he' must in plain En glsh have "stolen" it while we were off the coast, or while hewas on shore during a temporary visit with a flag of trocefor the surrender of prisoners. Had the sword been taken in fair fight by sea orland, or ia town carried by storm or'had it been left on the battle field, it might be aoepted -ty Sir W. Codrington ; but he could not with propriety have received it, nor can he with honour keep it, if it was indeed " found" in the town of Yalta; and, as our notics arm somewhat lax on these points in a military sense, and as our conduct is exposed tojealous and bitter criticism abroad, I, in common with many others who have the interest of the service and the character of the country at heart, wiU be well pleased to hear that the statement in the paragraph respecting the place whence this trophy comes is erroneous, and that it is setter entitled to the honour of being borne on the thig1 of an English general than it appearS to be, Your bbedient servant. ,RUDE JAII D!r!'3.s * san3. 16. * The Cb.ance11oa- of. the Excbequer arInokweugeg the- rece ipt v* the remaini-g halQs.; a, bsm' -a i alug o p' Q7 Q , x, Z."
STRA.NDING O91 ? :BOYAL I AMSUP TYNE. . . 9SO7JTHA TON, JAIK. 13. Great interesthas been excited here to-day bygthe report of the grounding, on one of the most dangerous parts df the tDorsetahire eoast, of the Royal Mail C'ompany's steamsThip Tyne, Captain Valler, on her passage to this port from the Braz.ils. The first intimation of the untoward event was conveved in a telegraphic message forwarded from Wareham by lieutenant Fuge, R.N., in charge of the mails on board the il-fated ship, and which was received at the company's offices here about half-past 11 o'clock in the morning, to the following effect:- "T The Royal mail packet Tyne is on shore fire mUes to the westward of St. Alban's Head, off Chapman's Cove, in want of imnmediate assistance. Part of the mails on shore enr oute to Southampton. At present all sate.' Immediately on receipt of this intelligence Captaih Vincent (the company's superintendent at thisport) got two steamtugs in readiness, withalarge number of men, ropes, and everything necessary fcr such an emergency, and started for the place where the unfortunate ship was groumded, which is between 40 and 50 miles from Southampton. Nothing morewas heardof the accident untilLientenant Fuge arrived here, about a quarter past 3 o'clock, with a part of the mails, per Dorchester Railway, from Warebam. lt appears from the very meagre particulars we have yet been able to gather, that the vessel sighted Portland Lights at 2 o'clock this morning, and about half-past 3 the vessel grounded, while at full speed. The weather was very thick at the time, and Lieutenant Fuge states that when he came on deck he could not see land for some time. The vessel is lying about half a mile from the shore, on a bed of chalk and gravel, between Chapman's Pool and Kinieridge Ledge. This ie the positi.on of the ship, as far as can be ascertained here from the intelligence which has been received and an examination of the chart. Lieutenant Fuge landed with a portion of the mails at 7 o'clock, and was conveyed in Lord Eldon's car to Wareham (the nearest railway point), and arrived here, as stated above, about a quarter Nast 3 o'clock. Part of the mails only were landed, there being too much sea on for the passengers and the whole of the malls to land. As the boat was leaving the ship a sea struck the vessel which set her broadside on and swamped the boat, and the mails were then landed in the Coastguard boat, which put off to their assistance. In lowering the slhip's boat Lieutenant Fuge's head was knocked against the side of the vessel, his face was considerably bruised, and his servant had his arm .broken. In addition to the two steamtugs from this place Her Majesty's steamer Retribution has been sent from Portsmouth, and also a tug steamer from Poole, to render any aid possible to the unfortunate Tyne. She is lying in a very awkward place, and we have heard several nautical men give their opinion that if she were a wooden ship she could not possibly hold together. The Tyne is one of the finest and strongest vessels in the Royal blail Company's service. She was built at Newcastle in 1854 of iron, and is of 2,184 tons burden and 450-horse power. The portion of the mails which have been landed are in a very wet and damaged state, and we have heard that water has got into the bullion-room of the ship. The Tvne is a paddlewheel steamer. 4;n official investigation into the cause of the disaster will, no doubt, be immediately entered into, beth on the part of the company and the Board of Trade. (By ELEoBIc TELEGRAPH.) LATME PARTICUmRS.. Several of the passengers of the ilifated steamer arrived here by the Dorchester train from Warehain about a quarter past 7 this evening, from whom we glean the following additional particulars :-The concussion when the ship struck was very great, and some of the passengers were thrown out of their berths. They were, of course, in a great state of alarm and confusion, and rushed on deck to see what had occurred. At this time, our informant stated, it was so dark and thick that he could nob see his own hand before him. The ship was then bumping violently. As the tide rose the ship eased and settled down, and every nmeaus were resorted to to get her off, but without avail. After daylight the mails were landed, as we have already stated. About noon the boats were lowered from the ship's side and the passengers were slung into them from the deck, thle high tide and heavy sea preventing their getting down into the boats in the ordinary way. During this period one or two of the boats were swamped and some of the passengers thrown into the water, but they were all saved, and we are happy to find that no lives were lost. The boats reached the shore in safety, andthe passengers on landing were tak-en care of by Lord Eldon, and conveyed to his estate, Corfe Castle, where his Lordship treated them in the most hospitable manner, and subsequently had the whole of them taken in his carriages and other vehicles provided by his Lordship to the Wareham Railway Station. A portion of the passengers came on to Southampton, and others remained in Wareham. They were landed without a single article beyond the clothes they stood in, and those who carne to Southampton looked very jaded and distressed. At the time they left the ship at noon no assistance had arrived, and the ship was half full of water. The pa!SengerS speak in the highest terms of the generous hospitality and kindness shown them at vorfe Castle, without whi~ch they must have suffered severely from hunger and cold.
MIfILITARY A2ND NAVAL INTELLIGENCB. Captain Longden's 5th company of the 13th battaion Royal Artillery, after being inspected, left Woolwich yes. terday morning for Shoeburyness, to relieve LieutenantColonel Fortescue's 6th company of the 11th battalion, who were received at head-quarters yesterday evening. Mfajor HosWs P field battery, No, 4, of the 12th, were yesterday morning inspected on parade at Woolwich br Major-General Sir W. F. Williams, Commandant of the garrison, attended by his aide-de-camp and staff, and marched thence, by way of the Common and the old Doverroad, for Norwich, in order to relieve Major Strange's D battery, No. 7, of the 12th, unler orders for Aldershott. The Antelope steam vessel, Lieutenant-Commander Pike, sailed on Monday for Plymouth, and thence to the West Coast of Africa. The Trident, 6, steam sloop, Commander Close, was recalled into harbour from Spithead on Monday. The Hastings, 60, screw steamship, was taken into the fitting basin at Portsmouth yesterday morning.

EOUTH-EASTO R Y. SOUITII - ESTERN. RAILWAY. CENTRAL CRMNAL cOTIRT. T&x. 1i. The trial of the prisoners Pierce, Burgess, and Tester, who are charged' with committing the exteulslve baWion robbery upon the South-Eastern Railwayin May last, having been appointed for this morning, the court was early besieged by applicaats eager for admission ExceUent arrangements, however, had beesnprovided by the UnderSheriffs, lessrs. Crosleyiand Anderton, andhence, althongh the trial evidently excited great interest, owing to tho daring natare of the robbery, the ingenuity with which it had been planned and execated, the largeness of the sum involved, and the apparent respectability of some of the persons implicated, the court was at no period of the day inconveniently crowded, and the proceedings were conducted 'without the slightest interruption or confusion. At 10 o'clock ]Kr. Baron Bfartin and MIr. Jastice Wiles took their seats on the bench, accompanied by the Lord Mayor, Aldermen Hatnphery and Sir F. G. Moon, Mr. SheriffMechi, MSr. Sheriff Keats, Mr. Under-Sheriff Crosley, antd Mr. Under-Sheriff Anderton. The prisoners, William Pierce, aged 40, described in the calendar as a grocer, and as iraperfectly cducated, James Burgess, aged 35, railway guard, we)leducated, and William George Tester, aged 26, clerl;, also well educated, were then placed at the bar. Burgess was dressed in the uniform of a railway guard, and the other two prisoners were in plain clothes Teeter, who is much the youngest of the three, and who wears a moustache and-large black whiskers, evidently felt the nature of his position much more keenly than his comrades. Burgess and Pierce, indeed, appeared to view their position with perfect unconcern, but the indifference of the.latter seemed rather of a sullen character, while the unconcern of the former was attributable probably to a natural gaiety of disposition whicht never allows itself to be long depressed. All these prisoners during the whole of the day kept up a pretty constant commtunication with their legal advisers. There were four indictments against them; the first charged-them 'with stealing 2001b. weight of gold, value 12,0001., the property of their employers, the South-EAtern Railway Company; the second charged them with stealing a number of bare of goldaud some gold coins, the property of the same prosecutors; the third charged them with stealing the same property in the dwellinghouse of the prosecutors and the fourth charged them with feloniously receiving the property, knowing it to have been stolen. The prisoners pleaded " Not guilty " to the whole of the charges. Serjeant Sheo attended specially, with Mr Bodkin and Mr. Monk, of the Northern Circuit, to conduct the prosecution; Mr. Serjeant Ballantine attended speciaUy, with Mr. Sleigh, to defend Tester; Mr. Saereant Parry, also specially retained, with Mr. Ribton, appeared for Pierce; and Mr. Giffard, Mr. Poland, and Mr. F. H. Lewis defended Burgess. MIr. Serjeant SHEE, in opening the case for the prosecution, said,-Gentlemen of the Jury,-It is scarcely poesible that you'should not have learnt, through the usual channels of information, the general history of the gold robbery committed upon the South-Eastern Railway Company. It is my dety to caution you, however, not to pay the least attention during the course of this inquiry to any information which you may have acquired from that or any other source. I shall confine myself carefully to a statement of that only which I believe myself to be in a position to prove, and I think that youwvll best consult your own convenience, as well as the justice of this case, byendeavouring altogether to dismiss from your minds everything -which up t) this period you may have heard relating to the robbery. Thoprisoners are charged with havingoommitted a robbery, on the night of the 15th of May last, of a large quantity of gild intrusted to the South-Eastern Railway Company for cmnveyance from London to Boulogne. Upon that night three boxes containing gold were delivered by their ovners to lessrs. Chaplin and Co., the carriers, and by them they were taken to the offices of the South-Eastern Railway Company, at London-bridge. One of those boxes contained gold, the property of 31essrs. Abeli and Co.; another contained gold, the property of Mesr'Spielmann; and the third contained gold, the property of Messrs. Bult. Those boxes were cound with irca hoops or bars; they were sealed and weighed before they left the premises of Messr Chaplin; and they were placed, as in the ordinary course of business, by the South-Eastern Railway Company, in iron safes, secured by Chubb's patent locks, keys of which were in the possession only of confidential servants of the company. There were keys in London, there were keys in Folkestone, and there were keys also in the custody of the captains of the several boats, which were the property of the South-Eastern Railway Company. Those iron safes were usually sent to Folkestone in care of the guard, who took them down with him in the van in which he went himself. On the arrival of tae safes in question at Boulogne, and on the boxes being taken out, it was found that one of them, which belonged to Messrs. Abell, weighed 401b. Iess than it had weighed in London. The box containing Messrs. Spielmann's gold weighed rather more than .ft had weighed before, and Messrs. Bult's box was also a trifle heavier than before, The boxes were all weighed again in Paris, and the weights there corresponded with the weights at Boulogne. At Paris it was ascertained that a quantity of shot hadobeen substituted for the gold which those boxes had originaUy contained, and it was clear, owing to the weights at Boulogne and Paris corresponding, that the robbery could not have been committed between those two places. Every inquiry was, of course, instituted, as soon as the fact of the robbery was made known by communication fromParis,tosatisfythedirectois andtheprofessonaladvisers of the South-EasternRailwayCompanyasto the place whera the robbery must have been perpetrated. After a full investigation they came to the conclusion that it could not have taken place either at Folkestone or on board the boat or prior to the delivery of the boxes by the carriers at the offices of the South-Eastern Railway Company at London. bridge, and they arrived at length at the reluctant conviction that the robbery must have been effected on the night of the 15th of May, 1855, in the van of the train of which Burgess, the guard, had charge. The prisoners at the bar havo all been in the service of the South Eastern Railway Company. Burgess was in their service on the night of the robbery, and had been so for 13 years before; Pierce had also been in their service, although he was not so at the date of the robbery. Up to 1850 he had been in their employ as a ticket printer; but in that year he was dismissed from that engagement. He was, however, well acquainted with the officers and servants of the South-Eastern Railway Company. Tester, atthe date of the robbery, was a clerk in the office of the superintendent of traffic, and he had tberefore ample means for obtaining knowledge and information as to the traffio thatvwas conveyed upon the line. Now, on the 15th of May, when the robbery was committed, Tester lived at Lewisham, Pierce at Crown-terrace, Hampstead-road, and Burgess at New Crop, near the South-Eastern Railway Station; and at the same thne a man named Agar, whom we shall call before you, and whom we believe to have been one of the planners and rarticipators of the robbery, resided at Cambridgevillas, Shepherd's Bush. Agar was never in the service of the South-Eastern Railway Company, and he is now a convict, having been arrested in Augsit, 1855, and convicted in the October following of uttering a forged check, knowing it to be forged. Be comes before you from Portland hulks, where he is undergoing a portion of his 3entence of transportation for life. I need hardly tell you, gentlemen, that a witness pr :-nting himself before a jury under such circumstances, and acknowledging himself to be guilty of the crime with which the other prisoners are charged, is a person whom a jury ought not to believe without strong corroborative evidence. You will find, however, mthis case that the statement which the approver will make to you im a clear and distinct manner will be confirmed by the evidence of a great number of respectable witnesses. Indeed, I can't help thinking that you will be of opinion that the circumstantial evidence against the prisoners is so strong that it would be sufficient to oonvict tbem of the offence with which thsy are charged even if Agar's evidence were not before you.. However that may be, I war;n yqu, a^s itis mny duty to do, ct to believe Agar until you fina thatheisconfirmed in all the important; tortions of his testimony. I cannot tell you rwhat the peirsints of A gar hadhbeen previonsy to thep pn- isning and perpetration of this robbery. It appears, howrever, that hie had been frequently to Ametrica.an that in 3May 1854o, he had been at home jinng!Zn Xbout 12 monZtlS having at tha,t time returned from Amenica. He bad been Cfpviously acquainted with Pierce, and eome short time ore this occurrence they met in the neighbourhood of Goventl arden. They conversed together as to tbe probabi i n obtaing possession of some of the gold bullion which was known to be in frequent course of transmission along the South-Eastern Railway. Pierce, I rather think, first suggested the thing, but Agar thought it impracticable. Pierce said that he had no doubt he could obtain impressions of the kevs of Chubb's locks, by which the iron iafes were secured. Agar said if that could be donie he thought that the rest miglht be managed; and they resolved, in order to ascerta3 what would be the bestmeans of obtaining possession of the keys, that they should both go down to Eolkestone apparently as casual visitors to a seabathing place, and that they shbuld take lodgings there, ad employ themselves in wateing the arrival of the tidal service trains and the delivery of the loggage from the trains to the boats. They accordingly went down ii the seconid week in May and took lodgings at the house of aperson named Hoooker, a fly diver, botween he station and the towna of olkesto. The lodgings were taken-in the name of daiI4b;y whicli name iA"ar passed auring their stay at Folkestne.

In fact, it became elear to them that they were watobed by, and were objects of suspicioa to, Razell, the inspector of the railway Rolic-e; s3teer, the superintendent of the borough polioe; o5harman, a police. const-able At Folkestene , and. Uhapmnan, an officer in the service of the South-Eastern Railway Company. This was to clear to them that onL one occasion they separated and went in different directions, and, after aL weekL's resdence in Folkestone, Fierce went to town, leaving Agar behind. Agrcontinued hiis observations' for another week, emploing himself as lie bad done while Pierce wa%s there, and he had unquestionably opportunities of observing what took place on ttoe arrival of th i tidal s;ervice trains, and wbat Chapmnan, who had theo custody of the key of the iron safe, did when the trains arrivred atdathe luggage was remnored to the boa"s By thes means Agar ascertained eventually where the key was kept, the impression of which it was to imnportant for hlis purpose to obtain.* Raving ascertained that, however, he despaired of obtaiuungn possession of the key, and, after staying iohrwe atFolkestone, he retured to L-ondon, and toldi Pierce that lie thought the thing was impossible. Buat Pierce was not so easily disheartened. He emnis to have known, in the last resort, by what means'he mnight succeed in effecting his object, and he said that he was not only quite certain that he could, but that he would obtain possession of the keys whereby the robbery might be perpetrated. He said that be know ayoung man namied le ster, the prisoner at the bar, who was inr the office of the superiLntendent of traffic on tho line, anid that no doutbt Tester could get possession of the keys for them. Agar remainedt for some time in London, in constant comymunication with Bureess and Pierce, and at length, somewhere, probably, about the monthi of July or AugustforAgr isi 'lot perfectly clear as to the date-PFierce infore i that it had c-ome to his knowledge that the locks of the iron safes were to be altered, that one of the keys had been lost on one of the boats that the companiy were resolved to bave the locks recomn6ined, and that the safes were to go to Chutbss in order to a recomnbination of the locks, an alteration of the tamblers, and the fittinZ of new keys. He also said that Tester would have the new keys in his poseson afteor the locks had teen altered, anud that he could get an impression of them fs'om Tester. That bigmentioned to Agar, he replied that he would rather takethe impressions himself, and he said, "Let Tester come to me with the keys and I will take the impression." Tester accordingly took the new keys to a house kept by a person namea Wallace and handed them to Agar, who 'went upstairs with them and took an impression. of thema isa wax. That done, it seemed probable to Agar that they might succeed in the robbery which they had planned. Hav-ing haow, gentlemen, gone so far, and having stated the cuse to you, as Apar will prove it, let me, in order to assist yout in forming' your opinion upon it, briefly recapitulate the evidence which I shal call to confirm the statements of Agarup to this point. Ishallprove to you by Mrs. Hooker, the landlady, that Agar went by the name of Adams while lodging in her house at Folk-estone, that he and Pierce went down to the pier together every day when the tidal traini arrived, aLnd that at the end of the week Pierceo went to London, while Agsr remained behind. I shall also prove, by the evidenceo of Hiazeo and Steer, that their suspicions; were excited by the eonduct of Pierce and Agar, who were alwa) a loitering about the pier anid station at the time of the arrival of the tidal trains. With respect to the impressions of the keys I sallU prove that Tester, being then in the office of the superintendent of traffic, wFrote, or conducted, the correspondence with the Messr. Chubb relative to the alteration of the locks. That alteration commenced inL June, and was continued down to October, when the now keys were made; and there can be no doubt, I should think, upon your minds that that was a fact with which Pierce could not have been acquainted, unless some one in the confidence of the comapany had informed him of it. Having thus obtained the imupression of one key, the question arose how were they to obtain an imkpressiorn of the other, for there were two locks upon every safe, and they thought that probably both locks raight be used when gold was being transmitted. They. therefore sat themselves to work to obtain an impression of the weondakey,and this wastho ingenious plan which they devised :-Agar appears to have been a mian who had money at his command, for whenx he arrived in this country from America he had somewhere aboutt 3,0001. of his own, or, at all events, a sumi which was no part of the produce of thisrobbery. He arraned there~fore, that there should beseut down to Follkestone a box of bullion of the value of 2D01., which should be conveyed by the railway in the iron safe in the same way as the bullion boxes of tessrs Abell and others wvere conveyed, and that it should be delivered to him (Agpr) at Folk-estone as in the ordinary cours of business. That box was prepared by Pierce in the mouth of October, 1854, and it was direceWd to "1C. E. Archer, care of Mhr. Ledger or Mr. Chapman,' two of the officers of the railway company at Folkestone. Agar having gone down to Folkestone, as arranged, calledat the office of the company, and said that he expected abox of bullion, and asked if ithad arrived. Ithappenedthatupon the day that he called ledger, whose duty it was to have delivered the box, had been mariied, and that in consequence he had gone away from the office for a few days. Agar therefore found Chapman, one of the hooking-clerks, there, Hea applied to Cha mann n. a Saturday, but the box had not arrived; on the Sunday stil it had not arrivedl; on Monday it had arrived; and Chapman, before Agar's eyes, opened the safe with a key which he took fromu a capboard in the office. He brought out the box directed to Archer, gave it to Agar, and tooka receipt from him for it, the bodly of which was written by Chapman, Agar excusing himself from writing -nore thanx the signature onL account of his bavibig a sore hiand -7% suggestion which was borne out by two of his fingers Leing iii finger-stalls at the time. The hox, as I have said; was de-' livered to him, and he saw the key which opened the sale replaced by Chapman. He thus obtained accu-rate information where the key No. 2 was kept, and having obtained it he 'wentupto London to communicate with Pierce. Now, in all these particulars I shall corroberate Agar by tho evidence of Chapman. Ledger was away on the day in question, but Chiapman was there, and he remembers the circumstance,i of thebox perfectly well. He remembers thesorebhand and the black silk fingerstalls, and he rememnbers Agar 1-epresenting himself as Archer, receivingthe box from himn, signing his nameas Archer to the receipt, and taking the box away. I shall further prove to you that Ledger, having in aday or two retummed to his duty, saw Agar at Folkestone ; and I Shalln rove also that Agar shortly after was at Folkestone with Pierce, and that about that time he dined at the Pavilion Hotel with Tester. Agar, as I have told you, having made this discovery, went to L-ondon and commnunicated to Pierce the information which he had obtained, and it was resolved that they should at once set to work to obtain an imipression of key Nso. 2. Accordingly, at the end of October, they went down to Dover, where they put up at the Dover Castle, and baring inquiredI the way across the heights to Folkestone they walked over and aLrrived at the railway-station at Folkestone before the tidal service train had come in. I-ow, when this train arrived, owing to the hurry and confusion consequent upon the embarcation of luegage and of propert hc a kniownx often to be of great value, ChapmanadLde were frequently for a shiort time absent fo h fie Agar and Pierce watched thes two persons and saw them both leave the office. Pierce thereupon walk-ed boldly in:he found the key in the door of the cupboard which contained the key of the iron safe, lie unilocked the cupboard, took out the key of the safe and brought it to Agar. Agar instantly took an impresion of the key, and Pierce then agAin entered theofofice and replaced it. Having thus obtained impressions of keys Nos. Iland 2, they hAd gurmounted~ in great part, the difficulties which had occurred to the mnind of Agar when the robbery was first suggested to him. The next thin- was to mnake keys from the impressions; and Agar and' Pierce immedliately set about it, Pierce at that time (October, 1854) having removed to Walnut-tree.walk, Lamnbeth, and Agar to Harleyford-place, Kenniington. They began by filing a blank key, or two blank keys, which they endecavoured to bring into correspondence with the impressions on the wax; and you will find that while residing at Walnut-tree-walkc Pierce, being a man of comparatively light complexion and light hair, appliedi to a hairdresser in 1embeth-walk to dress up for him a black wig, and yout will also findin tie course of thetevidenceethat he was disguised in a black wig during a part of these transactions. They continued ffiling the keys at Walnut-tree-walk until the maonth of December, 'when Pierce removed So Crown-terrace, Humpstead-road, the place where he lived when the robbery was committed, and Aizar removed to Canibridge-rillas, Shepherd's-bush. They-continued the fiing of the keys there also, and I shall call witnesses who wili prove to you that they were so employed for a considerable time, and I believe that I shall be able to produce before you the Tery tools with which thery-worked, At length the keys were completed to a probablecorrespondence with the impressions and with the locks which they were intended to open, aud it then became necessary to try thei. Pierce and Agar up to this timae were in consUtantCommuni111cation with Burgess, and they met at various publiehouses, includig theren= arquis of Grasnby in Lewisham-road, the Gen anin Tooley-street, and at Mlr. Stearn', house, the order to Sil tose keys. They did not fit at first, nor utilt 0ome time after. They fitte4 more erly, however, every time he went. At last thy fstted oompletely, and the robbery wm resolved upon. Haring sade up their minds totry nothing urtil it would bo worth their while to do so, and hbving aertained that go)d to the value of 12,000L sometimes went down the lisn, they determined not to attempt the robbery until a very large anount of gold ahould be m ooure of transmission to Folkestone, and they prepred themselves for a usatity equal in value to 12,0001. Y ascertinead that W2;000m in gold wonld weigh about 2 cwt., and they resolved that they would go to the shot tower on she Surrey side- of Rangerford-bnige, and porchse 2cwvt. of Iadsbot. They went tNether on tho fLst day, and each got 5 o6,ef shbot, whlih they caried over Huegerford.bridge to an omnibo!, and thus proceeded to Catmridge-villa Shephera7s1sh. The next day or the day ater Perc4went alosie; and he bought 5Mb. of shot; and on snother dy ewent again and prchased 6Mb. more. aving thus provided Vlesm,elres with the lead, they considered what it would bo necesary to procure in order to carry the leA aw to effiect their purpose. They ld the eAn dived into a timbor of parcels, hch they pat into-smnall bags made of the check &~th -whieth is used for duster4 xean they. bought that ~eloth, as Agar thinks, at Messrs.

Remember, gextlemen, I am now telling bad what Agar states; hut I believe that I shasw be able t4 corroborate Agar as to'this fact in a maanner which slhall leavelittledoubton your minds.

Spielmaun's box was attacked. went itooh out the whole of its contents, and disposed of te onthecourierbags and carpet-bags as they thought b ost convenient. Lastly, they attacked Messr. Buls box, which they foundf to contain much smaller bars than Messrs. Abell's, brein Californian gold. It was not convenient for them to take the whole of that. They abstracted therefore as mucl; as they thought they couda manage, and they replaced it witl flhat they conceived to be a corresponding weight of shot. The boxes were all carefully reyadjustea, the van was swept op, andl everythint was aarently quite right when the train arrived ait Yolkestone. The iront safes aere there given out in the usual way, and the train, withi Burgess and fierce and Ager, went on to Dover. At Dover they got their carpet-bags as first-claes t gpassers from Burgess, and they went into the Dover Castle publichouse, where they, somewhat inconsiderately, relieved themselves of their courier-bags in order to take refreshment, and they afterwards found it rather difficrlt to replace the nwithout observation. However,inorder to do this they sent the waiter ouxt to get a soda-water bottle filled with raudy, aned during his absence they put on the courier-bas again, to that they were ready to start once hmtor whien toe wather Nrturnedswith Stheon bandy Thfoe train stted at 2 o'clock in the morning. Pierce had provided return Ostend tickets, which franked the holder of them from Ostend to London. The porter at the station observed that no luggage had passed from Osbend that night. "Oh, to," was the anwer, "it came the night befre," and, giving tho man a few shillings, Mohir bagswere put into the htain, and, without being further qoestioned, they started for London. Arrived inr ondon, they immediately hbiled a cab and directed the driver to take them to the Great Westerhn Ltailway Station. When they weronearly there however, they countermanded that order, as if they had made a mintake, and directed hinn to drive to the North-Westen Station, and before they got there they told bins to stop at a tblicouse. PoThera they alighted, but, insteaofgergintot at particular public. house, they entered another, where they remained a very short time, and thence they proceeded to PierceSs house in Crown-terrace. They had not been there long when they determined to go down to the Borough-mnarket, where they were to mneet 3ioster, and were to obtin from him the bar of gold whicffbe had brought up from Redhel on the previous night. They met him on the steps of the market, and, having obtained froin him the bar cof gold, they next proceeded to the shop of a silversmiith in Leadenhall street, near tho India-house, and they there disposed of a portion of the American coin which 'had been in s essrs. Spielmnaun's box, for which they obtrained 2131. 10s. in cash. They thent poceoded to the bhop of Mes. Prommenl, Rudolf, and Co., money-changers, in the Haymarket, whiere the7r sold another portion of American golden e-agles, for which they received a check for 2031. 6s. 3d. Having done this, they retgned to Crown-terrace, and thence they con- reyed the geater portion of the gold which had been stolen to Cambri ge-villas, the residence of Agar. The first thing that they did there was to endseavour to cut off a portion of gold from one of the bars, whial they succeeded in doing, to the extent of about 100 ounces, by means of a hammer and chisel. That gold was given to Pierce, nd it will be prved that he sold it for about 31.in ounce. Pierce had as dth greater part of the cash which was the produce of the American k agles, anda he WAS2n1otssession altogether at that timne of a smmamounting to 7161 1s. 8d. And I begror attention to the fact that as early as the 2PthofMay serce had the means, by the sale of the American cs and of the 100 ounces cut off one of the bars of gold, of obtahiing, as you will find that he did obtain at the DeanK of England on the 28th of tay, six 1004~ Bank of England niotes in exchaDge for 600 sove- reigns. I shall caUl your attention to this fact againt resently. The rest of thego beingnwatC Cmbridgeve, as, it was a question how it should be disposed of. Agar was there hivinig under the name of Adlais with Fanny Kay, ,who passed as his wife, adthe lived next door to a gentlemuan named Bessale, whose wife died about that time. Clar had in his service at that time a girl named Charlotte Baker, andMilr. Bessell bad a siervant naimed Wild, both of ,whom. weshall call. It was determined that tho best way to get rid of the gold was to melt it into smaler pieces, and accordinagly iron ingots or mnoulds of about a foot in lengthx and two inches in breadth, tapering down to a point underneath (so that the transvers oention would be nearly an equilaterAl triangle), were obtained at a shop in Clerkenwell, and they then proceeded to erect a furnace at Cambridge-villas. The hrouse consisted of two rooms on theagroundc-floor, and a kitchen, two rooms albove and a dressing-room, and a wash-house behind. It will be shown that they purchased a naumber of fire-bricks, and that theY took out the stove of onie of the bedrooms upstairs andoput uphthefamracelinitsplace; and I shall p rove byAgar andmbv Fainy Kay, who, tough carefully excfluded from the room, beard and saw enough to enable he: accurately to cenfioo theb vidence of Agar, that they were there engaged dav after day' for a considerable time working in a tremendouis heaLt whiemelting that gold. I shall satisy you, moreover, that in the course of the work one of the crucibles was broen. and that the molten gold fatling upon the floor burnt it, and that some of the marks of the burning remain still- and, more than this, I shall produce some of tio bricks, with pieces of gold still adhering to them. The gold which was thus melted at Camhridge-villss remained there for some time, until, in. consequence of a quarrel between Agar and Fanny Kay, Apar left Canibridge-villas and wsent and took lodgings at Kilburn;* and about that time the ingots of gold wecre removed to Pierce's house. Shortly after this Pierce gave up his residence at Crown-terrace and took a house at hsilburn, which he called '"Kilburn-villa -" and there Agar went to live with him asa ledger. I ahabl prove that, at Pierce's suggestion, a hole wvas dog near the pantry of Kilburn-vills, and that the gold wras deposited there. Portions of it w ere taken out from time to time, however, and given to a Person named Sawvard, who llved in that neighbourhood, and who said that he had opportunities of disposing of gold. It appears that sold of the value of 2,500l. was sold to Saward by Agar and Pierce, and that the produce was distributed among the three prisoners and Agar. NTow, I beg your -&ttentsiou to the fact which 1 told you I should advert to again - namely, that before the melting of the gold beganr the sale of the Amercnc eagles and of tre 100 oz. of gold had placed Agar in possession of at least 6001., and I shall prove to you in such A wtay as to leave no doubt upon your mlinds that the produce of the 60OG sovereigns to wrhich I have before sAerted was divided betwecen the prisoners at the bar, On the 28th of May a person-I canx't tell you who it was-w,ent to the Bankc of England writlh 000 sovereigns, ad giving the name of Edgington saled to have sax 1004. Bank of England notes given him in exchange. I shall call before you a person from Messrs. Edginston, whose name was no doubt 1amiliar to the servanti of the South-Eastern Railway Compny, thboy bin Large tarpaulin mtanufacturers in the neighourhooa of the station, and he will tell yon that he had no knowledgo whatever of xack a transation. The six 1001.- notes, however, of course, had numbers, which were taken down at the Bank, anp I shall prove that in the September ollowing two of those notes went back to the Bank of Englaud With the name of the prisoner Tester on them, and I shall also preve that tha signature i5 in his handwr.tin. Another of the aotes went back to the Bank in. November, 1855, with tke name of "I Rlffau"' upon it, Br. Raffaa being a respectable fraiterer near Fitzroy-square, who,will swear that e put his namue on it, having received. it from Pierce and charnged it for hiin. The history of tho other three 1001.-notes is a little maoro complicated. They were paid into tie Bank of England by Messrs. Robarts CuVtH, aid Co. in the month of January, who had reoeived thern from nesrs. Hntchiuson,'the stockbrokers, who had purchased for Buruess, by direction of a person h tanied Lee, a number of Tarkssh bonds. and who had received from Lee the notes in question. Lee had received them fromn Burgess's wiFe. And it is romarkable that, in addition to the three 1001.-notes which will thus be traced from Burgess to Lee, from Lee to Hutchinson, from Hutclhison to Messrs. Robarts, and from Mesars. Robxats to the Bank of England, thero were also paid "into their account at Robart's. by Hutchinson and Co., eight 101.

A FREnCH MARiuoI oF PRDinicE.-The Si!ce contains the following:-" On the 29th ef December last a tows in the north of France was quite enfgte on account of the marriage of MademoiseUe 8ug6nie D- the onl daughter of a manufacturer of the neighbourhood, with X. Charles V-, the son of a wealthy merchant of Paris. The marriage was one of prudence and arrangement, rather than of love. All the questions of interest had been carefully atterded to, but the point of mutual inclina. tiox was totally neglected. Every one seemed gay and happy, except the bride. However, the ceremony took place and a wedding banquet followed, the whole being terminated by a splendid ball. The festivities were drawing to a close, when a servant informed the bridegroom that a gentleman desired to speak with him on a very urgent affair. The bridegroom went out, but did not return for the rest of the evening. The guests, bne by one, retired, but the husband still remained abset, and at last, long after midnight, the bride withdrew to the wedding cbamber. There she at once discovered the cause of her husband's absence, for on a table by the bedside she found a small parcel, and the following note from her husband:'Madame,-If I had no right, in marrying you, to expect a sincere affection, siace we were but little acquainted with each other, I, however, looked for a heArt which had never throbbed for another, and which I might by assiduity and tenderness in the end make my own. But along series of letters from youto another man has just been placed in my baud-letterswhicih prove that if yu give me your hand your affection has been given to another. I cannot, Madame,' accept such an arrangement, and, as I am unable to rend asunder the bonds which joined us a few hours since, I am deternined to Protest, at least bymy absence, aginst the union which I have contracted; and the first day of your marriage shall be the first also of a widowhood which shall only terminate by the death of one of us. Adieu, Madame, for ever r The next morning the house of the rich manufacturer was plunged into consteruation, for the bride was found dead in her room from the fames of lighted charcoal. On the table lay the parcel of letters transmitted by her husband, and near them the following note ;-' Monsieur,-It isI who am in the wron and it is I, therefore, who ought to offer a, reparation. gI give you the only one that is my power-I restore to you your liberty, and I expire, implorig youdr pardon'" Loss or A Scloo;m.-On the 21st of November last a fine schooner named the Invoice left Cardiff for Genoa with a cargo of 130 tons of bar iron, since which time no tidings have been received of her.

Jaimes, Clerkernwell, came before the Court just previous to Christmas, anad was then ordered to stand over upron the pArties giving ani undertak-ing that all matters xho-aid remain in sateuqiw. The suit is instituted by Mr. Turpin Carter and Mr. JohmDadley in behalf of themnselvai and all other the parishioners and inhabitants of the parish against the trustees of the churth, who are also trustees of the deed of endowrment, and against the "1Vestry of the Parish of Clierkenwell," the Bishop of London, and the Rev. Robert M1agaire, to restrain the bishop fronm inducting the last-name gentleman into the perpetual curacy or into _possession. of the church. It is also prayed that the election of Mr. Maguire mnay be declared void, and that the trustee may bo prevented frond presenting him to the bishop for induction into the living, and that the Court would declare that the right of election to the living is vested in the inhabitants anid parishioner;:, notwithstanding the recent acts of Parliamsenti for the better local governmeht of the metropolis-the&18th and 19th, of Victoria, chap. 120, and the 19th and 20th of Victoria, chap. 112. From Stow, Dagdale, Strype, and others, at ppear that the site of the church of St. James, Clerkenwen was onoe occupied by the " church of St. Mary by the Clerics' WeIll" which, with its adjoinling building, formed the priory of St. MAry for black nuns, or nuns of the Bone. dictine order, and was founded soon after the year 1100 by Jordan Ernset and Muriel his wife. At the timeo of the dissolution, in the reign of Henry VII., Isabella Sackville, of the noble family of Dorset, was prioress The first endowmnent seemis to have been a grant from .the fouLnder to one Robert, a p est, his chaplaini, of 14 acres of land adjoining 11the Cle.h fWweU ;" but so rapid seems to have been th rwho f the establishment that at the time of the dissolutionL its yearly revenue are stated at 2621. 19s. After various diLsposittions the site of the nunnery became theinhritnceof Lord Ogle, andthe church was granted by the Crown for terms of years to certain inhabitants in trust to use as a parish church, and it was dedicated anew,-namnely, to St. James-the-Less, until, in 1569, Queen Elizabeth grantod the church in fee to one Downing and another, " as to the priory of St. Mary it had beloniged." Not miany years elapsed before an attemnpt was made, which, however, failed, to prove that the church was a regular parish church, with right to tithes, although it was plain that it was simply a donative or prpetual curacy. The church passed through the hands of divers grantee,3by deeds dluly enrolled, and in15 taet hpos-ino cwr Drake, who lived aLt Tottenham-court, and who, the same year, sold it to the parish. At this point the bill in the peresent suit takes up the history, and set forth that by in. dlentuLre, dated 2d of June in that year, Drake conveyed to Josias Derners and four others "1all that the c'hurch of Clorkenwoll and the rectory or parsonage thereof and churchyard there,' and "1the advo,vson, donation, and free disposition and right of patronage of the vicarage of ClerkenweUl to the use of the-m and their heirs upon trast and conafidence nevertheless to and for the only use, benefit, andl behoof of the parishioners and inhabitants of the parish of St. James, Clerkonwell, and their successors for ever," ' ."chargeable, nevertheless, with one yearly peneion, portion, or payment of 4i. 18s. 9d for the perpetual maintenance of a curate to celebrate Divine service in the sad church," chargeable upon the church and churchyard only. The bill then states that from the date of that deed the church andits patronage had been heldbythetrustesortheir successors, the present trustees being Crople1, Pascail, Lovell, and Roberts, who were elected in I90 and the property vested in thenm. That inl1788 the old churh 'Was puled down and the p resent edifice erected under the provisions of an art (the 28th Geo. IMI), the fee-simple of which is now vested in the same trustees. That under the "Act for better Local Management of the Metropolis" (18th and 19th Victoria) the "vestry of the parishI hadl Eoen elected and were a corporation, and that by the act 19th and 20th Victoria, cap. 120, the former act was amended. That upon the decease of late incumlbent the vestry~ on the 10th of October, 1ISM, elected the Rev. ilobert Maguiire the incumbent or perplletual curate. The second and third sections of the Amendment Act are those upon which the question turns and upon which ViceChance. Ior Kinderslcy decided against the claim of the plaintiffs, and from which decisiont the present appeal was made. The former section provides that nothing in the former act or that act should affect or be deem:fto have affectedl any power of electing or appointing churchwardens, or making chiurch rates, or other power wvhich at the time of the passing of the act was vested in any such open vestry, or meeting in the nature of an open vestry, mneetiing of the parishioners, inhabitants, or ratepayera generally, as in the said act mnentioned, or any elcted or other vestry; nan the other clause, section thre declares that, "save as hereinbefore otherwise provided,: all the duLties powers, and privileges (ineludinig such as relate to the affasirs of the church, or thoe management or relief of the poor, or the administration of any money or ote rprV pUal to the relief of the poor) which niigt bae enperformed or exercied by any open or elected, or other vestry, or any such mLeeting as a oresaid in arny parish, under any local act or otherwise, at the time of the passing of the said act of the last session, shall be deemed to have become transferred to and vested in the vestry constituted by such last-mentioned act, except so far asan such duties, powers, or privileges may in the case of a paris included in a-ay dlistrict mAentioned in schedule B to the said act, be vested byscton 90 thereof in the Board of 'Works of such district, pDrovided that all duties and powers relating to the affairs of the church, or the management or relief of the poor, or the administration of any maoner or ether propert aplicable to the relief of the poor which at the time of th pasig of the said act were vested in or might be'exercised by any gardians, governors, trustees, or commissioners or anybody other than any open or elected o~r other vestry, or any such meeting as herebefore menitioned shall eontinue vested in, and be exercised by such gurdians, governors, trustees, or comnmissioners or other ?,Ir Tsafrsaina, i support of the appeal, stated and read exfnsoman cluss of the two recent acts of Parliamen, ad aiditseeedto be admitted on the other side thatunlss he itl ofthe inhabitants to the property in qeston as ncldedin the "1duties, powers, and prislees~ spkenof i those acts, the vestry who had eleced r. agure erenot entitled to elect at all, and tha th Vie-Cancllr, n hs jdgmnthad wholly foudedhimelfupo th cnstucton ie ad utupon the acts, that this propert and trust wersovte in them.

To show that an act passed subsequently to the foundation of a trust such as this did not apply, a cae arising upon the General Vestry Act, 53d eorge IlL, cap. 69, might be usefully cited. It occurred upon the construction of a deed of foundation of a school at Enfield, the deedi relatingz to which was dated in 1621, and the dispute was whether t-he General *Vestrj' Act in any way applied.' The case was; one sent from the Court of Chancery to the Court of Common Pleas, and it -was held by the latter that the deed was not interfered with by the act, although in the very, deed of foundation. the word1 " vestry"' was introduced. It was reported as " The Attorney-General v. Wilkinson" (2, Brod, and Bing., 266). This particular question of Clerkenwell had often been in litigation, and had received the attention of eminent Chancellors, such as lord Hardiwicke and Lordl Eldon. The former, in " The Attorney-Generalv Parker, " reported 3, Atk., 576, and l, Ves. senior, 43, heldva'n election of a minister to be void, considering that'the deed, and not the vestry, governed the construction of the trust, andthe same view was acted on in " Edenboroughv. TheAs-chbishopof Canterbury,' Estated in a note (2, Russell, page 101.) The learned counsl then referred to 'andi commented at length upon "the Attorney-General v. Foster" (10, Ves. 38), "the AttorneT. General v. Newcom (14, 'Ves 1), nand "Fearon v. Webb" in the SaMe volume.apagL1 Lord Justice-sOfsrr Bnucicg said thAt no one could doubt but that this question was one of great difficulty and importance, and should not be decided upon an interlocutory proceeding, such as a mnotion for an. injunction ; and asked whether the parties were willing to treat the appeal mnotion now before the Court as if it were the-hearing of the cause. Mr. TEiRRELL and M1r. HAuipy agreed to this, the latter, however, requiring that thecprish books, should be admiitted as evidence, for as much as they worth, to showr the usage and custom which hadl heretofore prevailed. After some further diseussion this proposition of the Court was adopted, if it should appear that the bishop did not object. Mr. TimnEELL continued his sr ent as upon the hearing of the cause, and insisted ETha the Vice-Chancellor's decision was erroneous, as being -founded upon the -words of the acts of Parliament, whereas the appointmient of a perpetual curate wAs a property in fee simple, vested in the trustees, for the benefit of the inhabitants, and was a trust vi hich had been adjudged to be vald by one Lord ChaucAllor and spoken of by another lord Chancellor as one to question the validity of which was then too late. Mr. STrra-r, on the same side, cited the case of "1Faulkner v. Elden," reported in vol. 4 of Brod, and Ding, 449, as an important decision at common law, to show that words neArly sigmilar to these ia these Acts of Parliament could not eed toapply to property vested in inhabitants and pa; riboers. lie contended that upon the whole scojie and intendinent and oDperations of the statutes the Legislature never inttnded to interfere with the right of election of -the perpetual curate, which was a piece of privte 1roperty, -- and even if the Court should he do opmon that such a construction were possible, the Court would not strain it, or kold it to be so Strong, so powerful, and so stringent as to render it incumbent upon the Court so to decide. That had such wiords as " duties," " powers," and "authorities" occurred aprivate grant, the Court of Chancery would not hold thatney mciudod a title to property;* nor, had there been in the inhabitants a right of common, could that right have been interfered 'with under-such words in these acts of arliament. Mr. HARDv (who, with Mrr. Daily, appears to support the decision of the Vice-Chancellor) contended that the advowson of the living remained in the trustees, though the right to elect a curate was vestd, and had passed to the vestry elected under the first of the two acts, and that right of election was a "right, duty, power, or privilege" to be performed by that vestry to long as the advowion remained vested in the trusee for the benefit of theparisb, or of the "inhabitantr. and parishioners," whatever those words might mean, If that were so there was nothing in the rIht to property wrhich ihad been so energetically insite4 upon bF the couiel for tho appellan-ts Then as to -the-yeetry, the word, mant a meeting of in- liabitants sasmbled4.i yes aud in eviy MaSe Of election of Curate hbere-_n t athe Cses cited for the appelant-thewor veery ws s considered.

Consols. prom early life the plaintiis bad been acqulirnted with a to named Ellis of the firm of Ellis and Co., atokrzrksens, and up to the tine of her marriage Eli had the custody of the greater Fart of herproperty. On the marriageofthplainttyfasetlement was executed, by which her property was aettled to her separate use, anid urnder which Eli was &pr~inted one of the trustees to protect the plaintiff's snterest. This settlement aLlso contained a clause to the effect that; that portion of the plaintiff's property above enumerated was to remain in the same custody as before her marriage. Ellis, in 1855, became baukrupt, and a dissolution of partnerahip took place of the firm of Ellis and Company. Pending the inquiries into Ellis's dificulties it was discovered that he had been dealing with the Marchioness De Rebeyre's securities, and had been makin use of the name of the firm in his transaction with regarc to them. The question now raised was whether the firra vere conjointlyliable with Ellis to make good the value of these securities, or whether Ellis alone was responsible to the plaintiff in respect to them. The plaintiff contended that the former was the case, and the defendants (who had been EUis'lartners) insisted on tho,latter. The Court; held that both before the marriage' of the plaintiff and subsequently the defendants, as Dartners of Ellis, Were joint custodians with him el the plaintifrs property, and that it would be most impolitic and unwiee to hold to tho contrary. It would be a dangerous precedent to establish that partners in a firm holding a high position in the city were not responsible for the acts oftheireco-partners when suchaacs were nominally performed in their joint names and a joint commisSon credited upon them. In the present case the lsmes which would fa on the defendants were caused by no want of precaution on the part of the plaintiff, or any fault of the defendants themselves, but simply from the misfortune of their having been allied in partnership with an unprincipled man.u Decree in favour of the plaintiff. MtSH V. GOODALL. Mr. FoLL'r moved in this case for an order to commit Jane Goodall and W. Goodall for contempt. A receiver had been appointed by the Court to receive the rents of some property belonging to Mr. Goodall in Newcastle, and the defendants had been served with it. They refused, however, to take any notice of the order, had received some of te rent in qusestion smnce the order was made, and had given notice to certain parties not to pay the receiver appointed by the Court. No one appearing for the defendants the order for comnmittal was made as prnyed.

FtThis case came before the Court on exceptions to the defendants' answer for insufficiency. In 1849 the plaintiff, who bad been for some yers prior to that period a Fellow of Christ's College, Cambr dge, waspresented by the defendants to the rectory of Br-nbham Westgate, in Norfolk, with the moieties of Burnham Norton and Burnhaux Ihph annexed, vacant by the death of the Rev. Barnard Gipi'n. In 1851 they grantea a lease to the plaintiff for 2; ?ears, determinatle with his incumbency of the tithes o the moiety of Burnham Westgate, at a rent of 701., being the same rent as that at which that moiety was conferred on his predecessor. The plaintiff alleged that when he executed such lease he did so in full reliance that it was a proper lease, and that the tithes therein comprised belonged to the defendants, but that, in 1854, he fisst discovered that they belonged to him as rector, and thereupon refused to pay the rent of 701. to the defendants. The plaintiff also claimed tobe entitled aarector of Burnham Westgate to certain lands in that parish, the rents and title deeds of which he alleged were unproperly vithheld Irom him by the defendants, The plaintiff had paid up to Michaelmas, 1853, the rent reserved by the leaso of 1851, but since that period bo had refusedto pay it, and the defendants bad commenced an action at law against him for the arrears. The bil prayed that it might be do. clared that the plaintiff was entitled, as rector of Burnham Westgate, to the tithes and lands in question ; that the le"se of 1851 might be directed to be given up to be cancelled, that the action at law might be restrained, and that the defendants might be directed to repay to the plaintiff the amount receied by them under the lease of 185L The deftndanta in their aLnswer stated that they held the moiety of the tithes leased by them to the plaintiff under a grant made to them in the reign of Elizabeth, for the purpose of founding three scholarship, paying one of the felows, who was to officiate as preacher, and providing a fire in the college-ball in winter and cold neather, and that they had, from the time of grant, leased such moiety sometimes to the incumbents of Burnham Westgate and sometimes to other persons, and that sinco the restoration of Charles II. the institutions were expressed to be made to the rectory of Burnham Westgate, and not as theretofore to the moiety of such rectory. As to the lands in Bnrnbam Westgate, the defendants denied the plaintiff's title thereto, and aubmitted that they were not bound to state any grticulars relating to them or to the title deeds thereof. he plaintiff excepted to the defendants' answer relating to the lands for insufficiency. Mr. Bacon and Mr. Batten appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Mialins, 1r. Elmsley, and Mr Evans for the defendantr. The VIu-CnE cmo}LLO said that the defendants' answer was clearly insufficient, and gaye them six weeks to put in a proper answer.
COIURT OF O.EN"S BENrr WqnCv-P -T,- IQ (Siings in Banco, beforc Lord CAMPiBELL antd JUs,tices COLERIDGE, WI101111AN, and E xL. At the sitting of the Court, Lord CAMIPBELL delivered judgment in several cases which had been previously argued. INGRAM1 V. BARNES. The question in this case, vwhich the Court had taken time to consider, was whether the plaintiff was an artificer, workman, or labourer, within the meaning of the Truck Act (the 1st and 2d of William IV., chap. 37). The plaintiff was a brickma ker, and he sued the defendant to recover the sum of 901., beink the balance of an account of several hundred rounds due to him for making bricks for the defendant, a railway contractor. It appeared that the plaintiff had been employed to make a large number of bricks for the defendant. The defendant supplied aU the materials, and the plaintiff all the labour, though he was not bound to give his personal labour. The defendant was to pay the plaintiff so much for making 1,000 bricks, and he set up a truck shop, and paid the plaintiff artly in and partly in tickets for provisions Fhe question was -h1bteher the plaintiff could recover from the defendant the amount of the tickets so received by him; and this depended on whether he was an artificer workman, or labourer within the mearing of the Truck Act. The question -was Tesrved for the decison of 'the Court, ana, a rule to enter the verdict for the defendant being Vauted, and afterwards agued, the Court took time to consider. Lozd CAMPBELL now delivefted the judgment of the majority of the Court inlavour-of the defendant. His Lordship said that if the case had been Mc integri he should have been of opinion that tho plaintiff -was an artificer within the meSning of the act; but his Lordship thought he was concluded by the decision of the Court or vxchequer in "Riley v. Warden," and subsequent cases, lc which a contrary doctrine had been held, where, as in tihe present case, the party was not bound to give, his personal labour -Mr. Justice ERLr, in an elaborate judgment, in wlhich he reviewed all the cases and the reasoning upon Which they were founded, carne to a contrary conclusion, dissonting from the majority of the Court H-is Lordshi0 thou hV.h plaintiff, who had given his personal labour, thougb gip not bound himlself to do go, was an artificer within ihe act, and entitled to its protection.

COURT OF COLwoN PT.v aq -- - (Sttg im~ Bnco, Hulary Term,eorLodCefJsie oCmI.iWD andz Jstices CRESSEL, WmA~m,ad This was an action tried before the Lord Chief Justice at the Guildhall, in which a verdict was found for the plaintiff subject to a reference. Mr. EDWARD JAxuEs, Q.C., now moved for a new trial, on the ground that the verdict was against evidence, and also ior misdirection. The action was brought to recover damages for a collision in the Black Sea between two vessels, both of which were in the expedition from Varna to Eupatoria. The vessels in that squadron were ordered to proceed in seven columns. The defendants' vessel was called the Conrier, and one of Her Majesty's shine, the Fury, had the Courier and another vessel in tow. The plaintiff's vessel was called the Sultana, and the Sultana and a vessel caled the Sir Robert Sale were in tow of the Hydaspes. The Furyformed partof the light column, and was in thenorthern division; the Hydaspes formed part of the 3d division. The orders were that the columns should proceed four cables' iength apart. On the evening of the 9th of September on a general signal being given to anchor, the Pury came to an anchor in her proper position, and ordered her towed vessels not to anchor, but they hung on by their cables. The Hydaspes, which ought to hav'anchored eight cables' length off, was not quite three off. In the course of the night the wind changed and freshened, and between 12 and 1 the vessels attached to the Fary swung round and came into collision with. the Sultana, damagingher bows. The master of the Courier called out to the Sultana to pay out her cable, but she could not do this because of the number of soldiers on deck lying aboutt iponh it. The learned judges direpted the jury that, if theybeieved the evidence, the Courier was acting under the orders of the Queen's.oficer and was bound to obey. Rule nsii granted. CURTLEY V. BIIADDOX.

The action was brought on a bill of lading against a shipowner, for not having delivered the whole of a cargo of suphur shipped by a vessel calledl the Gipsy Queen. The plea was that 100 tons had been delivered by leave and license of the plaintiffs to a third party. To support this plea evidence was given of a general average, and that the 100 tons had been delivered under an average bend. The CHIEF JUSTICE said, the question turned entirely on a cnllct f eidece.He houd hvebeen better pleased if the verdict had beqenutoheothe way, but the plesdn having been fully considered by a suecii jury of the citv of LonIdonb, and there being no new fact introduced, there Rule refused. FRENC11 V. STYRuIG. This was an action tried before Mr. Justice Cresswell at the sittings after last term in Londen, whea a verdict was found for the plAintiff m damages 2651. Mr. ATHERTON, Q. C., now moved for a new trial on the ground that the verdict was against evidence, and, failing that, for a rule to reduce the amount of the verdict. The action was brought for work and labour and money paid. and as to 1001., the plaintiff sought to recover it as k, bet which he had been authorized to make by the defendaht on a horse-race for him, and which, being lost, he had p4id on his account. The defendant admitted the authority to'make the bet, bat denied that he had given the plaintiffaut4ority to pay it on his account. With regard to the residue of the amount recovered, it was contended that it was a debt incurred on a partnership account in training a horse caled the Census. Rule niai granted to reduce the verdict to 1001. BARRErr V. THE GREAT NORTHERN AND sNUDLAND RAILWAVy COH51PAqES. Sir F. KELLY appeared to show cause against a rule callIng on the defendants to show why a writ of injunction should not issute against the defendants, enjoining them to cause rail.way trains t-o run through from London to Settle, and from Settle to London, without detention of passengers at Leeds. IHe appeared on behalf of the Midland erelway Comany and his friend Mr. Dennisona for the Great Northern Railway Company. It had been stated by Mr. Welsby, on moving for the rule, that he moved under the express direction of the Board of Trade. The leaned counsel proceeded to contend that the application was neot hondj Te one. Mr.sBrrett, on whose be half the appaliation was made, was a solicitor at Leedsc and was desndous of being refued a through ticket from London to Settle-not of obtainng one. On consuleting Brehaw it would be found thatthere was ao diffic in obtaining a thsrough ticket by the Midland Railway from London to Settle by the 3145 train, which reached Settle at 7,45; but Mr. Barrett hadc presented hirself at an earlier time and had demranded a through ticket by another train, which he new woupld not be granted. He had then obtained a through ticket to Leeds by the Great Northern -Railway 9.30 train, airiving in Leeds n atr2.30,knowing that there was no train to Settle from Lee till 5.30, having thus, very conveniently to hirself, sent three hoursin Leeds. The railway from oeeds to Settle was caledrthe Little NorthwWesterR Company, and was worked by the Midland Companyto Settle, so instead, of taking a through ticket from Stl to ondon bythis comapany and the Midland, Mr. Barrett had demanded a througnh ticket at Settle by the Great Northera Rallway to London, knowing he could not obtain it, and havinug arrived in Leeds from Settle at 2.15 had waited for the 4.10 Great Northernexpre, which arrives in London at 9.30. This appliction raised the 9uestiox whether any Individual of the public could call on either company to putt on a throug,h train to suit his personal conxvenience from every place where there mighit be a station to every other station on the line'! He submnitted that the case was mot within the Railway and Canal Traffic Act, and was a demand which no court of law could reasonably comply with. The second section of the Railway and Canal Traffic Act divides itself into two branches, the first of which was-" Every railway company, canal comnpany, and rail. -way and canal company shall, according to their respective powers, afford all reasonable facilities for receiving and forwarding and delivering of traffLc upon and fromi the several xailways and canals belonging to or worked by such com- paies respectively, and for the return of carriages," -ce. The second branch was this, that-" Every railway cornpmvanmcan canal company, and railway and canal comnpany, haying or working railways or canals which form pirt of a continuous line 6f railway or can'al, or railway and canal communication, or which have the terminus, !station, or wharf of the one near the terminus, station, or wharf of the other, shall afford all due and reasonable fancilities for receiving and forwiarding all the traffic arriving by -one of such railways or canals by the other, without:any u- reasonable delay," &c. This was a very salutary and ee. flcial act of Parliamaent, and contained powers w io4s, when put int motiont for the public advantage, would be attended with great publicbLenselit. But it did not, and could not, be -madetapl to a case like the one before the Court. He contended that, according to their respective pouw'rs, the companies did aflord all due facility to the passenger traffic between London And Settle. .The LORD Csrssr JUSToj6-The main object of the motion is a through traffic. Mr. Serjeaut BYLEs. I.f the comipanies will give us one throuh trainyper day itwillanswer ouLrpurpose. Sir ITr~ KELLY said, the motion was a disingenuous one. There was one through traffic train a-day by the 3frh*mVeand the expense was the same and the time con. sue 's rvelling the samae by both companies. The LoRD CHIEF JU5TIOE-To induce us to interfere there mnust be matde out a case ofyublicinconvenience. The individual inconvenience to M1r. Barett cannot avatil. Sir FiTxxoy KELLY.-Mr. Barrett complains that he cannt g hya trouh tainfro Kig'scross to Settle. But her is ne ram -da fro Lodonto Settle, which Mr. MLLOR Q.C, an Mr.Pamy oz eealso heard on Mr. xscnsor, .C.(with whom was Mir. R.! Clarke), on the ato the ra Northern Rawilay, con&urrd in what ha enstedo behalf of the Midland Company, and shwed byBadin' Time Table that theXe was a sible. as all the trans were timed to work .ith the trains for the eastern side of Scotland to Aberdeen. AMr. Serjeant BYLZS and Mr. WELBBY, in support of the mnotion, said the affidavit was from one of the public who was prejudiced, and it would be difficult to get an affidavit on the part of the public. The Great Northern Railway was the great highway from London to Lancaster and Scotland, or, at any rate, to Settle and its neighbourhood,and by the present arrangements, if the public went by that, the -most direct, tne shortest and quickest line, they were detained some two or three hours at Leeds. The act of Parliament contemplated that the railways would become the great highways of the country, and said theyshould be worked continuously. The arrangements were now so made that, although there was a continuous line of rails fiom London to Settle by the Great Northern, and to Methley, near Leeds, and then on by the 1idland and Little North-Western to Settle, passengers, even if they could get on without much delay atLeeds, had to go from one station to another. The Great Northern could accommodate their traffic and railway times when they saw fit to do so. The obstacle here was not with the Great Northern, but with the Midland line, who, having the line as far as Settle, sought so to arrange their trains as to comfel passengers to go on with their line from London to Settle, snd not so to arrange them as to enable the public to gofrom Methley only to Settle, going therestbythe anicker and shorter route over the Great Northern line. 'It was sufficient, if facts were brought before the Court showing that the statute was not complied with, to call upon the Court to put the act in force. The facts wwere, that the Midland Company afforded no facilities whatever for forwarding traffic by the Greet Northern Railway, and, although some of the trains wrere timed to start within 20 minutes for Settle after the arrival of the Great Northern, if the Great Northern train was late passengers could not get on, as the trains were not in communication with each other. The LORD CHIEF JusTIcE was of opinion that this rule must be discharged. It seemed to him that no case was made out that called for the interference of the Court. He quite concurred that it was not necessary to show individual grievances, but a case of publc inconvenience must be made out, and that did not appear from the affidavit of the party at whose instance this rule had been obtained. On the other hand, it was clearly shown that no complaints had been made on the part of the public. He could quite understand that, vhere there were two competing lines, they might so arrange their times of departure as to operate very seriously to the prejudice of the shorter line, the trafflc being forced over, the longer line to the sacrifice of either cost or tune. In such a case this Court would be called upon to interpose. In. the present case there was abundant communication between the places -London and Settle-by the mlidland line, and no extra cost or loss of time. Those most interested in having a line betweenLeeds and Lancaster-the Great Northern Company, so far from making any complaints against the Midland Company,were here to support instead of to oppose this rule. From no individual of the public, with the single exception of Mr. Barrett, was there any complaint. This rule must, therefore be discharged; and, having been moved on wholly insufficient grounds, with costs. Mr. Justice CRsswYzLL and Mr. Justice WiLLAus entirely concurred. Rule discharged, with costs.
COURT OF EXCHEOUF.P Tr1rAnv .T.. it LAAV1rnATn v vivmr- (Bcfore the CHiEF BARox and1Baron WATso,e.) Mr. HL HLL (witll whom was Mr. Griniths) showed cause against a rule for a prohibition restraining the execution of an order in the County Court of Luton, in Bedford. shire, for the payment of costs. It appeared that the plaint was issued in trespass to recover a claim of 41. 15s., which sum added to the costs of the summons amounted to niore than 51. The defendant appeared according to the egenc C of the summons, and in the course of the case, it being shown to the satisfaction of the learned judge that a RRestion of title arose, he determined that he had no jurisdiction to try the action. Thereupon he nonsuited the plaintiff, and, on the application of the counsel for the, defendant, ordered hun to pay the costs, including-the fee to the barrister. The main question was wh;iher a County Court judge, when it was bade apparent that there was an actual bond fide dispute as to title, had au thority to award costs, or whether the whole matter was t ken out of his hands altogether; and it was contended that if a man, knowing that such a dispute would arise, liked to go to the County Court instead of to the proper tribunal he ought in justice to pay the costs. Upon the face of the plaint the County Court had cognizance of the matter,. and to support it the plaintiff was bound togive evdence of somethmg over which the Courthad jurisdiction; ifhe failed to do so, he did not " make proof of his demasd to the satisfaction of the Court;" and in that case the judge had power by the provisions of the Couty Court to nonsuit him, notvwthstanding that he appeared and dissented. Secondly, the judge had jurisdiction to avard costs, for the amount claimed was more than .5&, inclusive of the costs, which formed part of the sum sought to ba recovered. Ur. LusH (with whom was Mr. Codd), in support of the rule, said there was a diversity of opinion and practice among the County Court judges upon this matter. The power to grant costs was expressly given by the statate and mrust be confined by it, and the question was what was the construction to be put upon it? He then proceeded ta argue on the various sections of the act and, b analogy, to the technical practice of the Court of Exche uer. Certainly, too, the person who took the objection ough? not to have costs, for he might waive the objection and give the Court jurisdiction by consenit. Next, if the Court should think that the judge had jurisdiction, the claim was only for 41 15s., not 51. 3s. 8d., and therefore the barrister's fee and extra costs should not have been allowed. The CsIEr BARoN said that these were points of very general importance, and the Court would reserve itS decision. HILLS V. THE LON^DON GAS COISPAXy. This was sn action tried before the Chief Baron at the sittings after last term in Middlesex, in which the plaintiff was nonsuited, leave being given to him to move to set aside the nonsuit; accordingly, Mr. KEowLES now moved for a rule to that effect, and stated that the action was broueht to recover damages for the infringement of a patent for purifying gas from sulphuretted hydrogen and other impurities. Formerly this was done by passng the gas through purifiers which contained lime, to the use of wvhich substance, however, there were great objections, and the object of Mfr. HllU's patent, which was obtaied in 1849, wvas to substituste another The COURT intimated that the full discussion had better be reserved til cause was shown, and a rule nit! was at once granted. BUCHEAI V. THE NORTH OF ENGLAND FIRE AND LIFE INSURANCE COi5PANY. Mr. MELLISH, on behalf of the defendants, moved for a ruleto show cause why the proceedings in this action should not be stayed, or why the cause should not be referred to arbitration. The action was brought to recover 8001. upon a fire Mohey upon the stock in trade and furniture of the plaintiff. e plaintiff claimed for a total loss, and, one of the conditions endorsed upon the policy being that in case any difference should arise in the adjustment of losses, the same should be referred to arbitration, this motion was now made under the provisions of the Common Law Procedure Act, it being, as it was said, essential that the matter Ehould be adjudicated upon by persons who alone were competent to understand it. The COxURT granted a rule to show cauge. (Sittings at Nisi Prius, before Mr. Baron BRAnMZLL ancd Common ,Jtries.) This was the first day of the first sitting in Middlesex for Rilary Term. Mr. Baron BRAmWELL said that, owing to Mr.bBaron Alderson's illness, and Mr. Baron Martin being obliged to attend at the Old Bailey, he should not be able to sit again until the second sittings; therefore all cases not tried to-day would be postponed till the next sittings, RISEAM v. SA:wNnE. Mr. Haw-ins and Mr. C. Pollock were counsel for the Plaintiff; and Mr. Edwin James and Mr. Lewis for the de.hfendant. This wasan action for an assault and false imdprisonsment.

The defendant's dog had is tongue cut. He had not ohserved anything peculiar about the jaw of the defendant's dog. The plaInti s dog had his tongue cut. A dog might hang out his tongue, and that being a disfigurement it was sometimes cut off. It was one of the secrets of the profession to increase the value of the dog. The plaintiff's dog was smaller than the defendant's, but was of the same colour. Charles Ogles knew the defendant. He had bred the defendant's dog. He had heard that the defendant hadlost his dog. The dog in court was not the defendant's dog. Cross-examined.-He was a glover by trade. He last saw the defendant's dog bout three years ago. The dog in court appeared to have had his tongue cut. He did not 'know whether the defendant's dog had his tongue cut. The case for the defendant was that the dog in question really was the defendant's dog, and therefore, although the verdict must be in favour of the plaintiff, the damages ou ht to be merely nominal. Sobn Sabine said,-I am the defendant, and live in Bloomsbury. I am a bird fancier. I bought the dog in question from a Mr. Scoen. I gave 131. and two other dogs for it. I lost my aog two years ago. Since I have lost the dog I have seen it with the plaintiff, who brought it to my shop. I told him it was my dog, and he promised to come agan the next night. He did not come, and I went to his house and saw my dog. I told him I wanted my dog, and he said he would not give him up. I then gave him into custody for stealing it. The dog in court is my dog. The Jaw is twisted, as the jury will see. He cannot bark like another dog. That is the dog that was before the magistrate. Cross-examined.-There is nothing peculiar about the roof of the dog's mouth. I did not say that there was when he was before the magistrate. The dog was stolen from my kitchen. I have got the date written down. My dog woul be about five years old now. I told the magistrate that he was three years and a-half old. I bave never seen the plaintiff with a black and tan dog. When we were in a publichouse I said my dog was very fond of sheep's head, and I fetched one. He would not touch the sheep's head, because I had a lady dog in the room, and that took his attention of£- I don't walk up Regent-street with my dog. Since. this action I have sold my things and spent the money. I have given up my house. Re-examined.-I used to give my dog a sheep's head every night for supper. When I lst my dog his tongue was not cut. Mr. Isaacs was recalled, and the defendant pointed out the peculiarity of the dog to him. He, however, said that he saw no peculiarity about the dog. Wiliam Beech, a fishmonger, said he knew the defendant's dog. The lower jaw of the dog in court was twisted. To the best of his belief that was the defendant's dog. Cross-examined--He had examined the defendant's do, at the police-court, and also several times before it was lost. Another witness was called who also spoke to the identity of the dog. Mrs. Sahine, the wife of the defendant, said,-I know my husband's dog. This dog is the one my husband lost. The side of the mouth where the tongue used to hang out is much less projecting than the other. COUNSEL having addressed the jury for their respective Mr. Baron BRAN1wzL, in sumnming up, said that it was admitted on the part of the defendant that the verdict must be in favourl be theO plaintiff, and therefore the only question would be the amount of damages. If the jury beleved that the dog really belonged to the defendant the plaintiff would only be entitled to very smaU damges * but if they considered that the dog belonged to the plaintiff, then hbe thought the damages should be much larger. People should be taught that wh en they were foing to do acts which would make others suffer they shoufd use the greatest caution, and if they acted with rashness they should be made to pay for it. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff-Damages 2D1. PAGE V. PATL. This was an action brought to recover damages for an alleged excessive and illegal distress. The defendant pleaded " Not guilty." r. Collier an Mr Fishe a eared for the plaintiff, and M1r. Petersdorff for the 'derfers an It appeared from the plaintiffs case that his wife was a laundress, and they had taken a basement floor from the defendant, who was a house agent in Sloane-street, Chelsea. They had paid him 61. for the goodwill of the premises and the connexion attached to them. At the time of the distress there was 21. lSs. 6d. rent due to the defendant, but the plaintiff had tendered that amount before the distress was maade. The defendant, when he caused the distres to be asde, said he did not care for the rent due, buthe wished to get possesdon of the premises. Instead of levying for the sum due the distress was put in for 51. lOs. Witnesses having been called in support of this view of the ease, The defence was -that the 61. the patifadoneering the premises was on account of the last tenant, who owed that amount of rent on leaving, and therefore the defendant tenaut. Witnesses wiere called in support of this view of the The learned JUDGE having summed up, The jury retumed a verdict for the plaintiff-Dama,

Mr. STOPR, tor the assignees, submitted that the adiournmentshouldbe 8inedie, and alsowithoutprotection. The ankrpt commenced with a capital of 5S. In three years he had incurred debts to the amount of 29,0001., of which 14,0001. were wholly unsecured. A large portion of the remainder arose upon accommodation bills. There would not be 6d. for the creditors, and he charged the bankrupt with having carried on trade for the purposes of fraud, in which he had succeeded. There had been a falsification of books, and the objeot of seeking an adjournment sine di4, hut with protection, was to avoid a prosecution, lie pro. osed to read evidence which had been given, and which, he contended, sustained the charges now advaneed.

ZAVSOLYEzX. DEBTOW OOURT, Jan, 13, I LI.-A *LA ikmo OF WINIOZSTER, IN ER RrV. 15t~~~Wr~ W,CEIESTE _ (Be-Jpfore Mr. Comm~iwon PHILLIP&.) This insolvency occurred so far back as 1832, but asequestration of the insolvent's living of Sutton, in Surrey, was made onlyin 1852. MP. SumzR appeared to-day in support of arule, which bad been obtained by the Bishop of Winchester, to set aside an order of the registrar disallowing certain charges ma4e in the sequestrator'saccounts. Mr. Smner, in showing.Cause, aid there were two sums which had been disallowed by the registrar of the court (Mr. Ingpen), one of 1SL SIs. for hotel expenses, and the otherof 448. chargedforthestipend paid to Mr. Hatch during the yeas 1851, 1852, and 1853. The learned counsel prayed for the discharge of the xegis. trar's order in reference to the frst and smaller sum, and nrged that the hotel charges were exceedingly imall, extending over three years, sad had been incurred in -pro. viding refresements for the numerous parties who attended the sequestrator to pay tithes. Thoeo charges were moderates and had been incrred ag the cheapest mode of oollecting the tithe, and similar charges had, he believed, been allowed in equity. With regard to the main item of 4481. disaIlowed by the rebistrar, that officer had very properly acted, btga.is nO authority from the bisop alo eating the stipend 3A& been produced to him. Upon the present occasion, however, the point rould ismnie a-dif fer*enit shape, as he (the learned counsel) woild produce au athority from the Bisbop of Winchester, dated in 1835, for the payment of 120. to the Rev. Mr. Hatch, subsequently altered, in 1837, to 150 per annum. In 1852 the official ssignee obtained a sequestration, there having been six previous sequestrations at the suit of other parties. It was it e true that in the yearss 1851,1852, and 1853 Mr. Hatch d not perform the daties of his cure, but they were performed by the Rev. Mr. Vernon, who was duly licensed by the bishop, but who received no stipend beyond the srplice fees and the use o£ the rectory house. Under these circumstances the creditors suffered no injury by the nonresidence of the rector, and the 1501. per annum had been paid to him according to the bishop's authority. If, however, the Court should dissllow the payments to Mr. Iatch as stipend, still he (Mr. Sumner) would submit, acon the authority of Burngs'EZccksjest lcd Lawe, that the hishop had power to assign to an incumbent a certain allownce for his maintenance. Mir. Commissioner PumLps observed that no doubt the bishop's authority would be sufficient warrant for the payments to the Rev. MIr. Hfatch if any good cause couldbe shown for his non-performance of those duties in consideration of which the stipend had been granted; but he apprehended the law did not contemplate a payment for dong nothing. Mr. SusR resumed the bishop had good reasons for permitting Mr. Hatch to be non-resident. Mr. BAsDnXrY showed cause against the rule, and, with respect to tho chuge for hotel expenses, the registrar acted correctlyin disaUowingthem. A landlord collecting his rents or a clergyman receiving his tithes might be justified, as a matter of good feeling, m providing refreshments for those from whom he receiLved mnoney, but a sequestrator who was allowed a percentage upon his collection for his expense and trouble had no right to tax the estate forwhich he acted upon any such ground. With respect to the supposed authority from the bishop to pay 1501. a-year to Mr. Batch, there were two objections to that document-frst, that it had been altered withoat being again signed and sealed by the bishop, and, next, that it was most indefinite in its terms, containing as it did a clause for the payment of past serces-" for the period during which he has already performed the duties of the parish." Then, as to the circuinstances under which those payMents had been made to Mr. Hatch. In 1845 the Rev. Mr. Vernon was licensed by the bishop as curate of Sutton, receiving as stipend the surplice fees and the use of th6 rectory house, and therefore the payment made to Mr. Hatch could not have been made in consideration of his having performed the clerical duties of the parish The learned Co' mnssronm thought it must be assumed that from 1845 Mr. Vernon had been the actual curate. Mr. BAIDi xY said that was so, and therefore the paymnents to Mr. Hlatch were clearly illegal. 'With regard to the alleged power of the bishop to assign a portion of the sequestrated income for the maintenance of the incumbent, that was a proposition stated' by Dr. Burns without any authority. That question, however, did not arise in this case, as the 3501. was to Le paid expressly for the perfornance of the clerical duties of the parish. UOn all points therefore, he submitted the rule ought to be discharged. Mr. SumNm, in reply, argued that there could be no doubt that it was the intention of the bishop to allow Mr. Hateh 1501. a-year out of the proceeds of his iving, and he submitted that this Court ought to act upon that intention althoug, perhaps, it had not been expresslv stated in the authority. He submitted that the authority to pay Mr. Hatch was not revoked by the subsequent license of fr. Vernon, and that, as the former had never been expressly revoked, it must be taken as still extin. He was not pre~are tosaytha th bihophadbee authorized to eassignthe surplictafeheswhiich only produced about 121. a-year, but surely it could not make any difference to the creditors whether they were paid to Lfr. Hatch or to Mr. Mr. Commissioner PHLiPS said, with respect to the charge for hotel expenses, he found that the law allowed a reasonable sum for the expenses of colecting the estate, and therefore it must be assumed that such allowancewould defray every expense to which the sequestrator was sabjectel Wi[ ,regard to the main question, there could be no doubt that the edbect of the bishop had been to provide for the due erformance of the clerical duties of theparish, and to award a due remuneration to the person who performed them. It was not pretended that two personsswererequired to perform those duties, and therefore it must be taken that Wr. Hatch was to receive the 150L a-year for discharging them. But the fact was that during the time for which the yments in dispute had been made Mr. Hatch did not perorr those duties, but they were discharged by another gentlemain whom the bishop had licensed for that purpose. As to the power of the bishop to grant Mr. Hatch a maintenrnce, that question need not be considered at present, for there was nothing produced to show the exercise of such wer. The Court could not regard the authority to pay . Hatc 501. per annum to be coexistent with the subsegnt Henase to Mr. Vernon, and, as there was still a conPi erable amot of debtso be discharged, he, with the greatest possible respect to the bishop's authority, could not hold that it could coexist with the hcense to Mr. Vernon to perform the same duties on account of which the 1501 had been originally allowed. The rule must therefore be diseharged, but as the point was an arguable one it would be discharged without costs.

POLICE. MANSION-1oEUS.-John Saville, the conductor of omnibus No. 2,885, was summoned before the LoRD M&YOR for having unlawfully refused to admit & passengerinto his metroplitan stage caae. E R. Thwaites,ofAddle-streeZ mwo"Senfactor, said,esterday7 eek, about 4 o'elock in the afternoon, I wras at the Mlower Pot a few minutes before the defendantfs omni bus came. It was a Winchmore-hil carriage, The defendant stood on the step, holding the door. I asked to be allowed to enter. He said, "You cannot, Sir," and spoke to the effect that all the places were taken. I think there were five inside at the time, and it carries ten. I am quite sure there were four vacant places. I told him I was going to Tottenham, the fare to which is 8d. The are to Winchmore-hill is snore. An ascending scale of farae is on the door. He said he would accommodate his WinchinorehiU customers first. He refused to take me. I said I would snmmon him. He said he did not care. Afterwards he said to me, " You may get in," and I was desirous to do so, but a Mr. Udell, who was Inside. said, "Do not let him get in, I will appear for you," and then I was prevented from getting in. I was prepared to pay the fare. Cross-examined by Mr. Lewis.-He did not open the door to me. He did not say he would get one of the regular passengers to get out for me. A gentleman got out to sccommodate a lady. Mr. Lewis then called witnesses for the defence. Mr. John IJdell, of Winchmore-hill, gentleman, said,I am in the habit of travelling by the defendant's omnibus four times a-week. Monday is one of those days. I got into the omnibus before the complainant came up. There were si including myself in it, and when Mr. Thwaites came up there were four empty seats. The conductor told me the names of the gentlemen who had engaged the four seats, and those four got in. There was a parcel on one seat and a rug on another. Mr. J. V an, of Winchmore-hill.-I was a & er and got in at Shoreditch. I had pre-engagedmy seat, and placed a basket on it. Mr. J. Grugeon, of Winchmore-hill, stockbroker.-I was a passenger by the omnibus, and had paid for my place in the morning to secure it. The lonD 3LUYon said, that although it would be nmore satisfactory to his mind if the whole four persons referred to had been present in order to prove the actual engage. ment, yet he thought the evidence given by Mr. Udell was sufflicient to induce him to come to the conclusion that theseats had been actually pre-engaged. A difficulty must always present itself in cases of this nature, when the old system of a hooking-office and waybill was not resorted to. As to the mode of entering into the contract, he thought that immaterial, so long as the contract would be considered binding between two parties. The Legislature had not enjoined nymode of contract, nd therefore the mode of making that contract must he left to themslvey. He thougt, at all ekents, that Mr.lewiis had shorn a sufficient toim.rbcrc case of pre-engagement of the four seats referred to; and, under these circumstances, he would dismiss the summons, but he would not order costs.

WORsiP.sTRmrr..-Christopher and Jane Regler, hus. band and wife, were charged with coining. In consequenoe of information being communicated to the Mint authorities that coining upon a very extensive scale was being carried on in the neighbourhood of Spihtlfields they gave directions to linsector Brenan, lately sttacied to the G division, to apprend ali he might find concerned init; andthat officer therefore, accomparned by Inspector Bryant two sergeants, and a constable, at 12 in the day on the 8tn inst. went to a small cottage in the rear of 3Montague-plaoe, Spitlfields, the yard-door and housedoor of which, being fastened, they beat open witha slede hammer, and on entering the place, which consisted of only one room, they found there the male prisoner, with his shirt sleeves tucked up, and a plaster of Parismould in his band with impressions for casting halfcrowns and forins. The prisoner offered a most violent resisbtane, and Blung the mould on the floor, and partialy crushed it, but was ultimatelyoverpowerredand secured, and on searchingthe place the officers found on a strong coke fire a ladle fiUed with white fluid metal and a mould for casting shillings, still bot; in a table drawer four counterfeit half-crowns unfinished, and two of them hot, and two files, evidently just used with their teeth fiUed with white metal while on an adjoining shelf were discovered a glvauic oattery with plates complete, the wires wet with solution, pieces of ss, with metal adhering to them, a plate filled with sand for scouring the coin, a jar filled with acid for colouring and coating counterfeit money, and a bag of plaster of Paris in powder. In addition to these other galvanic battery plates, evidently newr, were found in a cupboard, andirom the floor and the fire were recovered several spurious shillings and a half-crown partly fused, of the dates of 1816 and 1845. This prisoner was handcuffed, lodged in the station and remanded, but, as false coins still appeared to be issuem from the same place, the officers again went there on Monday, the 12th, at 10in the morning, and on suddenly smashing a hole in the door they found the female prisoner there with two children, the woman throwing thinps about the room in great excitement. On getting into the place this time the oflicers found on the table 12 base shillings, and one good one and a florin, apparently used as patterns, a battery, with solution complete, four other good shillings and two mnore counterfeits, with various implemente formaLking bae coin; and on searching the adjoining cottage, which was unoccupied and very dilapidated, they discovered in a recess In the wall two more moulds for forins and shillings corresponding with the base coins they had found before. On securig the woman sheacknowledged herself tobe the wife of the other prisoner, and said she had had a presentiment that she would be taken, but that she was resigned to her fate, and had done it solely to keep her children from strving. The wife was stated by the police to be a much more expert hand at false coining than her husband, who was also himself stated to have been before convicted of smashing; and, both having reserved their defence, they were fully committed for trial. LA?Bmdnr-Joseph Lucas, a private in the Fusijeer Guards, who his been in custoay for some weeks on a charge of robbing Mr. leap, a tradesman, of nearly 20g, Wms finay examined. An officer from Salisbury deposed to the prisoner having been tried in that city in 1850 for burglary, and sentenced to two yearse imnprisornnent, and that before that he bore a very indifferent character.

A MFaICA. tA summ.a3of the f llowing, received by electric tehegraph, appeared in cv e second edition of yesterday :-] LVEBRPOOL, TuESDAY. The Britis3. and North American Royal MIail steamshiP (',anada, E. G. Lott commander, arrived M in the viersey this morning with advices fromi Boston to the 31st ult., and New York, by telegraphb tiai Halifax, to the 1st iust. She brought ,270,6S9 specie on freight,. and 50 passengers. The Canada was detained by fog. The Royal Mail steamship Europa, hence I December 27, and the screw steamship Edinburgh, I from the Clyde December 30, had xrrived at New York; the screw steamship Kangaroo, hence, had arrived at Philadelphia December 31, and the Royal Mail steamship Niagara, hence, at Halifax January 1. Respecting the non-arrival of the Hermaisn steamer at Near York some very correct surmises were expressed. The general opinion was that she had been disabled in the same gale as that experienced by the America. It appears that the captain of the Hermann had written to his wife, informing her that he should probably not make the voyage to New York in less than 20 days on account of some imperfection in the machinery. The Senate had adopted a resolution calling for information whether more efficient means could not be adopted for the preservation of the lives of ship*wrecked persons on the New Jersey and Long Island shores; also, whether relief should not be granted to the families of those who lose their lives in attempting to rescue individuals from shipwreck. Thle NYev York Tribmne says, it is a matter of certainty that New York has been for a number of years the centre of the trade in slaves between the coast' of Africa and Cuba. The number of slavers despatched from New York wvithin the last three years, though not easy to state with precision, did not fall short of 25 or 30. But, though only one of the three vessels captured has been condemned, and only two out of 46 persons held to answer convicted, the zealous and persevering efforts of the United States District-Attorney and Deputy-MvIarshals have not been quite thrown away. A number of the most active participants in the trafhic have been driven out of the city, and several slave captairs and persons who visited New York with the object of buying or of fitting up vessels. The Portuguese Consul has been suspended from his functions on suspicion of complicity. In consequence of the interference of the United States the price of slaves in Cuba is said to have been rising. It is supposed that the steam revenue cutter lately fitted out at New York is intended for the prevention of Filibusterina and the slave tradee. A bill is before the Arkansas Legislature to compel all free negroes to leave the State, under penalty of immediate sale into slavery for life. A bill allowing negroes, Indians, and mulattoes to give evidence in cases where white persons are parties has passed the Senate branch of the Iowa Legislature by a vote of 19 to 18. A bill " to encourage and promote matrimony" has been introduced into the legislature of North Carolina. The following paragraphs contain the latest intelligence respecting the slave excitement in the South. The Marlborough Advocate says,- " Two slaves, the property of Mr. Henry Dangerfield, were arrested and committed to gaol on Friday last, and on Sunday five others wvere also committed. Those first arrested are said to have given some informnation, or to have made some disclosures, concerning an insurrection on which public apprel-ension appears to be based. In consequence of these circumnstances, public meetings of the citizens of this district were held on Saturday and Monday last for the organization of patrols, and for taking other action in the premises." The Besryville (Virginia) (Gazette has the following:- " Jrst before going to press three slaves-Joe, Tom, and V incent-the property of Mrs. George L. lCerfoot, near Millwood, and a free negro, named Alfred Thompson, have been lodged in our gaol for attempting insurrection. We lenrn that these negroes expressed themselves before the justice who conimitted them as familiar with a plot of insurrection to commence in our county, and also at Harper's Ferry, two months from the first day of lIovember last; and, further, that they bad heard white men and negroes tALking if Fremont was elected they would be free, and, as they knew he was not, they vvere prepared to fight for It, and threatened the lives of two of our meat worthy citizens as the first they intended to take." A letter from Jackson, Mississippi, dated the 21st, says: *Our town is in a perfect state of excitement to-day in consequence of rumours of an intended negro insurrection, to take place during the holydays. "The mayor has issued a proclamation calling upon the citizens to organize and prepare to crush the insurrection ill its bud. Twventy-seven negroes have been arrested this morning. The extent of the plot is not known. Feelings of doubt and anxiety are universal. " Our citizens are in a fearful state of excitement. The particulars of this excitement are hard to obtain; and, although universal, the origin and fouridation are Tery diflicult to ascertain. " Rumours from Canton, Mississippi, also have reached us of a similar state of affairs. "How far 2orth Alabama maybe in danger ecannot say withicertainty, but there areriumOurs of rebellioniinthat quarter." A telegraphic communication from Louisville, Kentucky, under date the 29th of December, says:- " There was great excitement at the Court-house here on Saturday, in consequence of the examination of the negroes -who are charged with murdering the Joyce family. William Joyce, a brother, proposed that the negroes be burnt, to which the crowd responded ' Aye,' biet they were finally quieted by the Court, and the negroes remanded to prison. The presumptive evidence against the nerroes is strong, but there is nothing direct against them save the confession of one of their number." New Orleans papers, received at Baltimore, contain despatches from Mississippi and Northern Alabama, giving reports of slave excitement at ,Jackson and Canton, Mississippi. Great alarm prevailed, and a number of negroes had been arrested. A Tennessee paper states that Senator Bell loses about $10,000 by the insurrection panic. Four of his negroes in his absence were hung by one of the local courts, and five more afterwards bythe mob, withoutjudge or jury. Yet there seems to have been little or no evidence to inculpate them. Huntington, the forger, had been found guilty, and sentenced to four years and 10 months' imprisonment in the New York State prison. The appearance of the wvould-be Filibusters who had left New York in the steamship Teiinessee did not promise to afford Walk-er much material aid on their arrival in Central America. They are described as few in number, but vith their spirits up from having poured large libations of spirits down, and almost ready to do anything but remain quiet. They gave an indefuiite number of cheers for almost every object of much or little interest in the city of New YorL. One tal individual, upon whom the eyes of the spectators were fixed with attentiot, and 'who was looked upon as a powerful accession to the army of the General, jumped on shore just before the steamer departed. Another would-be heso vho had evidently contemplated the same movement failed in the attempt, for he slipped on the icy deck and suddenly took a prostrate position, in which he seemed to lie with perfect ease and comfort, refusing the aid of those -who stood around and seemed anxious to minister to his wants, and resigning himself to lie in the bed he had made for himself. Another enthlusiast is described as a bully called Pat, who had been excited to join by two women upon whom he had been living for two years, and who had Bupplied him with the means to go to Nicaragua. IF'rom the recognition-of those on board of the steamer it was presumed that on her de- parture New York was less dishonest than before, a greater crowvd of blackguards and blackleas having seldom appeared on any pier in New York. The Tennessee, three days after leaving New York, had to put into Norfolk, a shaft having broken. Baltimore was in consequence swarming with Filibusters. The steamship Adye, with 50 additional Filibusters, including General Wheal, bad arrived at Norfollc to take uip the passenigers of the Tennessee. The Newo York Tribitune says that the text of the last Central American treaty which appeared in Tlhle Timaes, extracted from the Neto Yorlk Herald, was surreptitiously obtained. Of the treaty the same journal says:- "T,ahis tieaty is one of very grave character. It has no parallel in the past diplomacy of our Government bat that negotiated between Messrs. Clayton and Bulwer, which it far oetvies in all that rendered that instrlument rem arkable Its recognition of the Mosquito savages as an independent ]Puwer, with a largeexteutol territory; stsstipulationsthatoar Govermnent, in connexion with that of Great Britain, shall undertake to settle the reciprocal limitsof Nicarag6a, Costa Rica, and Mosqito; its singular and complicated.provisions witlirespeot to Greytown orSanJusndeNicaragrta ,its express recognition of British HEondmsas and attempts to define her boundaries, are at least far out of the ordinary course of our diplomacy, contrast strongly with our current jeers at BAitish assnmption with regard to Mosquito, and are just sueh -as none other than a Democratic A dministration could rea- sonably hope to carry through the Senate and sustain before the country. On the whole, *ve are inclined to opprove and ulhold this treaty, tho not wihout niisivibgs tha it will ultimately involve Us in worse complications than those it resolves. We consider itastipultions in the main fair and equal, though entangling, and we are inclinei rather to regret that exigencies exist which demand suqh a treaty than to complain that those exigencies have not been in ore wisely met." A serious accident had occurred on the Haarlem Railroad, owing to the breaking of a rail. Though no one was killed, several persons were seriously if not fatally injured. The Netv York1 Jo tal of Commerce urges an adjustment of the tariff, and, referring to the article wool, says,- "The only difference would be that, whereas we now import over $30,000,000 per annum in woollens manufactured for us abroad, we should then be encouraged to bring out part of the wool in a raw state, and manufacture it here. We are MiUling to leave it to the decision of any man with plain common sense if the bringing in of foreign raw wool to manufacture here would afford any more injurious competition to our wool growers than the importation of the same wool already manufactured. We cannot secure the wool to manufacture ourselves, unless we admit it on the same terms as England. This argument applies with ecqual force to other raw materials." The British ship Pemberton, of Liverpool, bound from London for New Orleans, was lost on the 9th ult. on Grand Croajer. A boat containing eight of the crew, in attempting to land, was upset, and three of the number perished. They were Thomas Grifliths, of Liverpool ; Daniel Black, and George Nelson, the latter a native of Holland. The survivors of the crew were taken off by a tow boat. A ship was being fitted out at New York for the guano islands in the Pacific, about which so much mystery prevails. She goes out in ballast. The adventurers purpose sending her return cargo across the Isthmus of Panama. A party of riggers who were sent on board the wrecked packet-ship New York had a narrow escape from drowning. Finding a storm impending, some of them abandoned the vessel, getting ashore in the life car. The remaining riggers, nine in number, were compelled to spend a most fearful night on board-not sheltered in the ship's cabin, but driven by the breaking sea into the ship's top, where they experienced all the rigours of the dreadful snowstorm which prevailed during that night, and were not released from their perilous position until the afternoon of the following day. The ship fiUed dowvn to the top of the poop, and the sea made a fair breach over her, at times as high as the foreyard. A Texas paper asserts that Sea Island cotton can be raised to advantage in Western Texas. Some planters on the San Antonio river had raised more than 1,0001b. per acre. The Illinois had arrived at New York with the Californian mails of the 5th ult. and $1,671,569 in specie on freight. The total vote of the State for President was 107,377, of which Buchanan had 51,925 ; Filmore, 35,113; and Fremont, 20,339, giving a plurality of Fillmore and Fremont over Buchanan of 3,527. A comet had been seen in the vicinity of Sacramento; its tail is reported to have been ten degrees in length. Much rain had fallen throughout the State, and the prospects of the miners were favourable. The money-market at San Francisco was more than usually stringent. In general merchandise an exceedingly limited business had been done. From Havannah we have advices to the 25th nlt. There was an absence of activity in business ow'ing to the commencement of the Christmas holydays. The sugar-market was firm; the stock on hand was 45,000 boxes. Rum was in active demand and firm. Molasses were coming forward freely. Exchange on London 4 per cent. premium. The Solent arrived on the 24th from St. Thomas's. The advices from Panama are to the 19th of December. According to the Sf am the blockade of all the New Granada ports was to be enforced. The same paper asserts that the object of Admiral Bruce's visit to Panama was to examine the practicability of establishing a British naval depot in the Bay of Panama, in order that the British fleet in the Pacific, now principally steamers, may receive their coal across the Isthmus. The officers of the Monarch were surveying the harbour at the Island of Tobago. The UnitedStatee' Government. it says, has also been thinking of taking a similai step. The Esk hadcsailed for Acapulco, touching at all the Central Amelican ports. The New York commercial advices report increased activity in the money-market, the demand coming more especially from parties holding stocks Loans on call were in great request at 7 per cent., and in some cases as high as 12 per cent. Nafnes less known 12 to 15. Stock contracls were difficult to make even at 14 to 18 per cent. In some instances 1 to 2 per cent. had been paid for loans to the 2d of January. A reaction in monetarv business was not expected to take place until after the first or second week in the New Year. The favourable tenour of the European news had created a slight improvement in the market for stocks, but the amount of business was limited, and no inclination for large investments shown. Railroad bonds and shareswerequotedhigher, animpulie havingbeen given to the market by purchases made on forieign account. Business in exchange continued dull. There wasagoodsupplyofcommercialbiUs onEnglandin the market at 108. Bankers' signattires, C) days' sight, on London were quoted 10S8 to 108 ; on Paris, 5f. 21J-c. to 5f. 20c.; and on Hamburg, 30i to 361. The cotton-market rtiled firm, with moderate sales, at 12%c. for middling uplands, 13c. for Mobile, and 138c. for New Orleans, being a slight advance on previous rates. The demand for flour, both for export and homne consumption, was limited, and quotations of conmnon and medium grades had declined 5c. to 10c. per barrel. The provisionmarket on the whole was firm.

CITY SrwEns' CooSussioN.-There was a sitting of the Court of Sewers yesterday at Guildhall, Mr. Depnty Peacock in the chair. A conversation arose respecting the Late scaffold accident in Cornhill, in the course of which Mr. Deputy Harrison stated that he was authorized by the proprietors of the premises where the accident tobk place to menition that they had in the first instance, erected a scaffold at acn immense ex anse, which they had been told was quite sufficient, but, in order to prevent such accidents in future, they were prepared in a few days to remove their business to other premises. Mr. Haywood, Surveyor to the Court, said the scaffold was as sufficient as it could possibly be, and no more could have been done unless the shop had been closed. The accident in question had in reality occurred in consequence of the incautious conduct of the workmen. Upon the production of the half-yearly report of accounts several comnnissioners expressed an opinion to the effect that at a time lie the present when there were so many frauds, it was impossible to take too much precaution to prevent them. It was resolved to refer the subject to a select committee. A letter from the commissioners apwointed by Sir B. Hall to report upon the great drainage schemae, stating their anxiety to receive suggestions from the Commissioners of Sewers, wasorderedtobeentereduponztheminutes. Dr.Letheby,the City Medical Officer, brought up his Iuarterlyreport of births anddeaths forthree nsonth8endingthe27thofDecemberlast.

THE BRAZiAS .AYD RIVBZ PLATE. SOUTHAMPTON, TuESDAT EvNL. I We have jtst received, per -railway from Wareham, onr advices and papers brought by the Tyne steamer, Captain W. Valler, which unfortanately grounded this morning off St. Alban's Head, on the coast of Dorsetshire, as detailed in another column. The dates by this steamer are from Buenos Ayres, December 2; Montevideo, 5; Rio do Janeiro, 16; Bahia, 20; Pernambuco, 23; St. Vincent (Cape Verds), 31; Teneriffe, January 5; Funchal (Madeira), 6; and Lisbon, 9. The Tyne has 55 passengers, among whom are Commander Otway, RN., fromRio; Mr. Pecher, BelgianConsul-General, from Rio; Mr. Lilley, American Consul, from Valparaiso ; and Dr. Ackland, from Madeira. She also brings specie from Montevideo, value sterling, 401. ; and from other ports, 3,1021.; diamon,s, value sterling, 32,548&.- and jewelry, value 561., being a total of valuables of 33,7461. The cargo consisted of 425 bales of cochineal, 255 barrels of tapioca, and 140 packages of sundries, and she has also two South American lions for the Royal Zoological Society. On the outward voyage the Tyne experieuced fine weather and smooth seas, but on her passage home she met with head winds throughout the passage. A comnplimentary address was presented to the captain on her outward voyage, signed by 80 of the passengers. Our advices from Buenos Ayres state that trade had been good, chiefly in anticipation of the differential duties to come into operation in February, 1857. Opinions were very much divided as to what would be the result of this measure. The most prevalent opinion, however, was that it would fall to the ground. Rides and all produce had an upward tendency. The wool clip was nearly finished, and was expected to be of superior quality and very abundant. The election of Governor was beginning to give rise to considerable discussion, opinions being divided betweenGeneral Escalada and Dr. Torres. The Rio Uruguay steamer, from Paraguay to Buenos Ayres, struck on a snag and sank 80 miles from Ascension; passengers and crew saved. Exchange, 6s., with an upward tendency. Doubloons, 333 to 335 paper dollars each. At Montevideo the election of senators had taken place on the 30th of November, and, although Don Manuel Oribe had given his influence in opposition to the Government, all passed off quietly, the Government being triumphant. It was rumoured, however, that Don Manuel Oribe would be banished from the country, in order that his influence might not preponderate on any future occasion. The country was in a very prosperous state, and business good. Ex. ports were on the increase, as several saladeros had commenced operations. Hides had advanced in price. Es. change, 4s. 24d. to 4s. 2d. From Rio we have advices to the 15th of December. There had been a great tightness in the money-market. The Bank of Brazil had raised the rate of dibcount from 8 to 9 per cent., and even so discounted but insignificant amounts. Out of the bank the rate of discount was gene. rally n per cent. In eonsequence of this pressure, and of very considerable purchases of coffee, exchanges had under. gone great fluctuation s since the 13th ult. On London the rate opened at 27'1, 27', and suddenly advanced to 28, 28S 28S, at 60 and 90 days. The transactions upon London were 750,0001., generally at 28d. Prices of coffee declined 150 reis. Green good first was very scarce, and eagerly sought after at 4,550 and 4,600 reis. Sales since the 12th ult., 282,900 bags, of which 169,500 were for the States, 70,900 for the Channel and North of Europe, and 42,500 for the Mediterranean. Freights-for the Channel, Hamburg, Antwerp, and Marseilles, 60J. to 65s. ; States, 90c. to lG0c. Stock of coffee, 100,000 bags, badly assorted; market very firm, with upward tendency. Exehange-on France, 340 reis; on Hamburg, 645 to 653 reis, 90 days'. The accounts received from the interior of the country represent the coining crop as being only one. third of the present one, and the highest estimates do not exceed 1,300.000 bags. The law raising the export duty on coffee from 9 to 11 per cent. was to come into operation on the 1st of January. The following is extracted from the latest Rio price current:- " Coffee.-We noticed in the postscript of our last cirealar of the 13th ult. a sale of 10,000 bags. Another of 15,000 bags was closed on the following day, both at the rates then quoted. In consequence of symptoms of an approaching tightness in the money-market, concurrent with an upward tendency of the exchange, business remained suspended until the 19th, when a decline of 100 rs. brought forward buyers, and 48,000 bags were disposed of from that date to the 21st. Abundant supplies in the latter part of the past month, higher freights, and an advancing excbange, compelled dealers to submit to a further decline, which at the close of the month had reached to 200rs. on the quotations of the 12th ult. Calculating the higher figure of freights and exchange, as also the difference in quality, which has continued to fall off in tbo past t*o months. the present cost of the article on board in sterling barely differs from that of previous shipments. Notwithstanding the flat accounts which we continue to receive from the United States, as well as from Europe, our market has since the Lst inst. exhibited great activity, occasioned in some measure by the requirements for engaged vessels, as also from the expectation of an improvement in places of consumption, so soon as the money crisis in Europe sub. sides. old since the 12th ult. to date 282,900 <ags, of which 169,500 for the United States, 70,900 for tho Channel and North of Eurepe, 42,500 for the Mediterranean.

ArR. THACKEA rYS ZECTURES. Conformably to his plan. Mr. Thackeray devoted his third lecture-delivered last night at the Marylebono Institution-to the " life and mannez" of the country during tho reign of the third George. It *as hot till the lecture wasabout half finished that the monarch himself was introducedto the notice of the hearers The earlier portion was occupied with the general aspect of London life at a period which Mr. Thackeray characterized astheageof " finegentlemen." Theraceof " fine gentlemen" is almost obsolete, and, indeed, derived its nutrition from a certain spirit of veneration which has long ceased to characterize the civilzed world. It was from the correspondence of George Selwyn that the character of the " fine gentleman" was chi'r;ay to be taken. From this sketch Mr. Thackeray therefore drew largely, and, briefly adverting t% the immoralities of the Duke of Queensbury and the Earl of March, dwelt at some length on a notablo divine, who openly avowed that he did not believe a syllable of his creed, but considered himself honester than a lawyer, who was ready to perform any 'service whatever for a noble patron, but sometimes felt fatigued after what he called a "hard day's christening," and who was an excellent judge of all that pertained to good living. Altogether the xoraln- of the aristocracy were lower than in the days of Charles II., and, considering that the nobility had princely fortunes, and nothing to do, this me.ancholy state of things was no subject for marvel. While the aristocracy were thus leading dissipated and worthless lives, the country was saved-in Mr. Thackeray's opinion-by the moral and intellectual greatness to be found in the middle class,-in the men belonging to the professions, commerce, literature, and art. The lecturer passea from the delineation of courtly profligacy to depict a group composed of Johnson, Reynolds, Goldsmitb, Garrick-, and other celebrities ef their time. As for Johnson, he might be regarded as the preserver of the highest institutions of the country. The people had learned to look upon him as an oracle; and, as the oracle declared in favour of Church and State, Church and State were suffered to exist. At last George ILL came upon the scene, the lecturer declaring that the intrinsic goodness of that Monarch must have been great indeed to survive the effect of the immoral atmosphere into which he was born. In his earliest youth his mother described him as a " dull good boy," and to the qualities of head and heart thus pithily summed up ho adhered in after yeaTs. Like most dull people, he regarded superior intellect with constant suspicion. On the other hand, he loved mediocrity, apd hence, Beattie was his favourite poet, and West his favourite painter. Even his attachment to his future Queen might be traced to a common-place letter in whicb she described the horrors of war with all a school-girl's platitudes, and the adornment of the princess with the crown of England might be compared to the reward bestowed on some spelling-book heroine. On the earlier part of the King's married life MIr. Thackeray dwelt with rapture, tinctured with the finest spirit of irony. The scene within the palace was that of a perfect Arcadia. Queen Char. lotte's performances on the spinet, or, perhaps, little coantry-dances, in which King George would figure for three hours to the same tune, formed the sole amusement of successive evenings. A deeper tone of sentiment was afterwards given to the domestic picture by the introduction of the Princess Amelia, as the being most doated upon by her father. The description of a procession of the Royal Family at Windsor, with the little Princess, three years old, as the central personage, was one of Mr. Tliackeray's most charming'achievements. As for the sons of George IL, they were sources of small pleasure to their parent ; nor did Mr. Thackeray wonder at their revolting against a mode of life which; if it was the perfection of order, was likewise the perfection of stupidity. The many anecdotes that are current about George m., and that represent him as perpetially peeping into cottages and chatting with the inhabitants, were not passed over by the lecturer, who observed that they indicated a species of good humour that was the very reverse of dignified. The Caliph Haroun Alraschid was wont to indulge in similar acts of condescension, but his pleasantries were always followed by munificent gifts, whereas George ILL occasionally bestowed a guinea upon the favoured cottager, occasionally found that he had nothing in his pocket. Small as these homely jokes appear at the present time, they delighted our fathers, who loved to look upon the garrulous old King, clad in his Windsor uniform, regarded him as a thorough Englishman, with a national hatred for all French kickshaws, and applauded Gilray, when he represented George IIL as a giant, holding a pigmy Napoleon on the palm of his hand. The lecture, which was mostly of a light and playful character, free from that severity by which tho first two were characterized, was brought to a conclusion of almost startling solemnity by a most eloquent prose-lyric (we can call the passage by no other name)- uttered with reference to the madness of George III. Mr. Thackeray had treated the King, and even his Queen, with uniform affection, and had even consented to regard the mos' arbitrary acts of the Monarch as thoroughly well-intentioned, but it was clear that he was laughing at his favourito George through nearly the whole of the discourse. The picture of utter bereavement which terminated the whole gave to the hitherto comical figure the tragic dignity of a Lear or an (E dipus, End Mr. Thackeray bowed to his audience amid wondering epplause.

AWFOLY SuiDD}EN DATEH.-About 10 o'clock this morning an elderly gentleman was coming up from the railway station, and, when arxived at the top of Batlerstreet, he suddenly fell down. He wospcked up and con. veyed into the Railway Taver, and M. Hall, surgeon, who was passing at the time, was called in, when life was found to be extinct. Mr. Hall, with the assistance of several gentlemen, examined the pockets of deceasod, with a view of discovering a clue to his identity, when the following la-ge sums were found upon him:-4061. in gold, 1001. in l01. Bank of England notes, 6(s. 4d. in silver, and 7Jd. in copper, and a receipt, read over by Mr. Hall, as one for a deposit of 8,5001. in the bank of Messrs. Pedder and Co.; of this town. The money was sent to the Old Bank, where ho was identified as Mr. WhaDey, from Welsh Whittlo. The doctor expressed au opinion that the cause of death was disease of the heart.-Preston.

TIBE LYCOME-TAX MOVEMENT. A imeeting, convened by the; Association for Promoting the Interesrs of the Trading Community, was hold lits evening at the-London Tavern,for the purpose of considering what steps should be adopted to procure a removal of the tax upon aU incomes inder 150l. per aunum. Mr. STRATriON, who presided, opened the proceedings by briefly dwelUing upon the despotic and inquisitorial character of the income-tax, and complaining that under the pretent system, while men were called upon to make a return of their incomes, if the commissioners thought fit to doubt the accuracy of those returns they could call upon the taxpayers to produce their books, and expose those sacrets which every one was desirous to cor.ceal The society which had convened the meeting was composed of tradesmen who felt the oppressive burden of the tar, and notwthatanding many unoust taunts aid hindrances with which they had been met, the society had held m any meetings both in London and -in the provinces, *t al of which the utmost enthusiasm prevailed. Mr. UNsDERsWOOD moved the ftrst resolution:- "SThatthls meeting baai beard withl alarm and regret that a1ag nmNber Of warrants o. iStrees iiDd ether legal preerojends have been ssued for non-p,ayment of income-tas against pcrsons ret ligblea and vho apreawholy uaible to Pay; nnd thils meeng catnot too sttotgly condemn the practiceof u lieaati n. the affections of Her ath' t anSUjects br the indes cin of a tax wdesm, o the one hnd erects a barier against edec atio, fetters trade and idustry, and deprives the. tans c.f the confortu and necesaie of ife am], oncth outherand,Oseus a deerfed.

It oas a bhoel to suppose that mechanics or middle-class tradesmen wiere not anxious to provide a good education fortheir children, bhut the tax which fell upon those who had only 100m a-year swallowed up the only fund by which that education could ha procured. lter remarkng upon the unfairness of taxing precarious icomec at the saume rate as fixed and certain icomes, the spetirer condemned the ta as repressive of iudustry andas anHincentiveoffalrshood. nothersocietywas workig in the same direction,arlehoughinith some diherence in detail, and he wished it success* but he thought, instead of an "equitable adjhustmen" oh an unjust tax, it was most proper to reheve those first who meet required relief cHear,fhear.) The proposition of the societywth which he was connected was, that all incomes under 1601. should be entirely exempted, and that a man with 1601. should onlypay upon 0t. Heear, hear.) Mr. Ger,boar seconded the resolution, contending that the peorliar class who possessedaincomesmunder 1t0e was that which required immediate relief. It wass the clerw, the small tradesman, the curate, who had only 2b or 31 per wHeek, vhose means weore ripple d and whose comforts were restricted by the operation of the present system of taxation. Be did not object to an equitable adjustment if possible, but he did think it would be absurd to go to the Government and ask them to htke 7df ig the pound when, in fact, they were aledged to take only sd. (Hnear, hear) The nation had willngly assented to the burden so long as it was necessary to combat the encroachments of despotism, under the belief that as soon as toe war was concluded the tax would oease, but had that becn the caset? (ear, hear.) Hfe recommended the meeting and all electors to make the question a test for all candidates for their suffrages, and he had no doubt but justice vould be done. The speaker, after vindicating the society from suggestions which had been made, that money had been paid to its canvassers under the ia that it was for another associaton having a simiar object in view, concluded by condemning thepartialety of the restem which compelled the little tradesman to produce his books to verify his return, while mt allowed wealthy men to make compositions rhich,in one notorious case at Glocestcr,had enabled a man to compound for 1,o500.i a-year, whie a subsequent investigation showed his income exceeded 1S,000I. por annum. lfr. SHImy- moved an am endment, recommending a readouttment of the tax, but itmdid not obtain a seconder. the original resolution wsam then put and carried unanimnously. Mr. enomar moved the second resolution, which was as follows:- fTha this mEc ting Is decidedly of opinion that, int order to Protect persons againste continuance of the present creel, unjust, and inquisitoria ystem of decidind cases of appeal, aul nho fel grieved ban such decision would dt wei to make a solmn declaration Of the facts of the ease before the Right Hon. the Tvord Ma6yor, or some iustice of the PeaCe, and erownardthe same to tho ioaro2d Inland hevenue; and In care nO means are take to ascentain the truth of such decario. then to forwvard,aopyof thesame to the Right Hen the Cbancelie of bheExchequer. souctisg the immediate attenton t r that right hen, gentleman thereto " r. WINThP. seoonded the resol uton. As a vorki-ng mPan hohad felt the oppression of the income-tax. Ho was assessed at 1001 a-year, out of which he had a blind wife his waime's sistor, three children, and an aged parent to support. His wages as an engineer were o9s. a-week, with occasional overtime. UTpon ap'sealing to the commissioners hewastreated almost like a dog, told he must pay, and because he did not a broker was sent in. Being determined tgot rsnrather than pay, he had removed his goods. (ea ofmwhhoney was aid byhis wife's relatives, but the effect upon his wife had e such that for three months she was on a sick bed. The next year again he did not pay, and that time he was taken to Horsemonger-lane Prison where he remained for 10 days, until he was released by the imtervention of the society who had called the present meeting. (HIear, hear.) The speaker concluded by reading a statement of hisblast veek's expenses, which amounted to 21. 4s,, while his earnings were only ar. I9s. 9d. hr. Wr uto described the treatment wshich he had undergone. He kept a small chandler's shoDp at Broimleyn the tak-ings of which were only 31. lOs. a-week, of which the profits were only IOs., making together with his occasional earnings as a dock labourer atotal annual income of less than 401. Nevertheless, he had been assessevd at 1OOl., andsnotithstanding an appeal the demand wras insisted upon, and he w,as in hourly expectation of being taken tiprison. ("Shame.") These facts he had solemnly deposed to before the nord 3fayor. Mr. EXBY denounced the quibble by wvhich the existence of the double income-tax had been prolonged for another year. The resolution wvas then unanimously adopted. Mr. HMW1Am proposed,- "Thatntlsnmeeting is of pinien that the act of Paliament by which the Increae incom-t21X was created ought to bo reve ale forthwith, and tb2at the rema ining charge during the ensu ing se§ion of Parliamnent be placed upon1amoco equitable basis, o the taxe upon trades and proressions hetotally repealed." He was connected lwith a society wose objects were to procure the abolition of the war tax, and to plarce the incometax upon the footing upon which Mr. Gla dstone had placed it. Be did not propose to perpetuate the 7dl. iff the pound. Mor. GtheoN read the heading of the receipts given by the Properotyand Income Tax Assocation, which he iu 2sisted. justinied the belief that its proceedings would lead to the perpetuation of the 7d. tax. After some explanation from Mr. HfIOHAM,htr. Buorr seconded the resolution. LIr. WAILLmoved,s and hlr. KHaIose seonded, as an amendment,- "That this meeting would recommetd all persons hao have eetn compele to sery any merometax for wh2ch they are not u ip. ' bylaw to make a roletun g eclaration of the favts of the boro anud appy fer its return, oe-t to the surreyor oF the distric-, and, f noe retolaed, then to the bearo of Ideandr Revenue." The resolutin was then put and negatived, and the amendment vas carried. AFter a votes of thanks to the chairsan the meeting, which was very numerous-ly attended, broke up. MEETDTG AT DROITWICH. Dstorrwtcsr, Tuesday. A meeting of the inhabitants of this borough wtas held at the Town-hal, Droitwich, yesterday, the layor in the chair, to "consider the propriety of memorializing Her opajesty on the present oppressive income-tax, and of passing resolutions condemnatory of the tax and of its presen mode of administration." There was a good attendancd, and the Right Hon. Sir J. S. Pakington, hLP. for the borough, w las present. The Mnayor, Mhr. Clay, having opened the proceedings, Mr. PRcDine, auctioneer, moved the first resolution, as follows: - *That the ircome-tax laws are, in their present sorm, unjust and ppreusivea and oght to be speediy repoeledw while the oinuarnce of the tax, imposwn for the support of tho war, for two years after the restoratien of peace 4s, o nthe epo of theumeeting, inconistent and unsafe." ~ ~ wul nt ayi Mr. FARDON, salt manufacturer, seconded it. Sir J. PAMreGTON then addressed tho meeting. Referring to the objections made by previous speakers against the continuance of the war-tax, Sir John said, the additional tax had been imposed to defray the expenses of the Russian war, and the act which empowered that increase laid it down that, considering the impossibility of winding up the accounts incident to the war immediately upon the restoration of peace, the extra tax should remalin in force for12 months after the 5th of April next following the atificatieon of peace. It so happened-he would not say it was anything more than a mere accident (a laugh)but it so happened that thme signing of the treaty of peace was postponed till at few days after the 5hof Apri ("shameful"), and the practical result was that the increased tax would be probonged for two years after the proclamation of peace. But they all felt that, though this might be carrying out the act according to the strict letter of the law, it was not in consonance with its spirit. (Hlear, hear.) And he agreed with them that the country had a right to demard that the spirit as well as the letter of the act should be respected. Hle was not surprised at the feeling which pervaded the country at large on this subject, asashown thtoughsthe public newsPapers, and he had no doubt that the general voice of the country would make it imperative on Parliament to take this view of the subject. Theobjectionsto the tax, however, were not confined tothe war portion of it, and ho was glad thatitculd not be imputed to him that It was from any mo.mentary. objection that he concurred in the opinions that had been expremsed concerning it. Those opmions he had on former occasions publicly declared in the House of Commons when he had the honour of holding an office in Her Majesty's Go. vernment, and when Lord Derby's Government had desired to see the inequalities in the tax rectified. Ho conourred with Mr. Priddoy that the ownehs of houses, and, he would add, of land, paid a great deal more than their proper proportion; for they paid on the rack rent. They not only paid on the revenue dernved from the property, but also upon that which was never realized. Then he wa3S also ready to admit that the taxpressed ihbrshly on thosec lasses which were the possessors of life incomes, whether arising from trades or )rofessions. He would, for instance, assume thnt an individual was in possession of an income of 5001. a-year either from land or.from money in the funds, and another derived a similar income from his trade or profession. Both paid thesamene mountof tax, butinthefirstcasethe taxpaycrwhen lie died left his land or his funded property to his children, while in the second the professional man or tradesman left nothing behind him. It was clearly the duty of the professional man or tradesman to save somethingt for the benefit of his family, or to insura bis life with the samne object, and the amount taken from him in the shape of incometax would go far to effect this. He had always thought and avowed his conviction, whichl he continued to uphold, that if it could' possibly bo donid, s omeiadjustmentof the tax ought tolbe effected. He was awaro that the answer tothis was,thatit would beimpostibletoarrangethetaxso as to meet'evepraso; but thatwas no tason whynoattempt (Heal, sheai)be mzade at a mere equitable i'nstoient. (eaher)Having thus ex-pressed Isis general concur. renee on the object of the meet-ing, lhe could not refrain from adding '§oine- further observa.tions npon the subject. HIe trusted they would make allowance for thec position in which he stood as their reV?esentative, and for the dut-s which he owed ' not only to his Constituents of Droitidh but-to the country at large, when he aid lie thought 'it* a right that he ahould not fetter himself by any distiict. pledge with regard to the course which he should take in the coming session of Parliament on so* important and difficult a subject as the raising of therevenues of the country. .they would all agree witha him that Plarliament was about to meet under circuiustances of considerable anxiety. It was ha o l true tfiat the warx wth Russia in whicb this country h involved was at an end. It was also true thatthose questions hich unfortunately-whether culpably or rot he would not nowsay-had been left unsettled, andwhich might been involved. us in a renewal of the European war, had been brought to, a satisfactory termination by the last conference at Par He hoped, therefore, they might feel aconfidence that there was no danger of a renewal of European war. On the other band, however, they could not regard with indifference the fact that they haa lately become involved in fresh hostilities with two different parts of the world. (Hear.) He referred to the warlately broken out with Persia, and to the unfortunate collision with the Chinese nation. Oz theso subjects it would be the duty of Parliament to demand explanations of the Government. Those explanations, no doubt, Her Majesty's Mlinisters would be ready to give, and therefore it Would be unbecoming in him (Sir John), having no means of information beyond the public newspapers, to commnit himself to any decided opinion upon these important mat. ters which he might not be at full liberty to revoke or reconsider; but he could not forbear expressing his appreheIon that there were grave doubts as to thepolicXS 'Cad led to the war with Persia, and as to thns of our attack upon tho Chinese. These were subjects which must awaitfurtherinformation. Thewar withPersia wasthe subject of the most serious and threatening apect, and was. the one, moreover, on which they had the least information. They were not informed, for instance, whether this var was the result of the policy of our Indian Government, or of Her Majesty's Government, or whether its cost was to be defrayed from Indian revenues or from the revenues. of Englacd. Whichever it might be, he would follow out the saying that " England cannot afford to have little wars." With regard to our attack on China, we had access torthe fulest informahion through the published correspondence which had passed between our plempotentiary at Hongkong, the Chinese Conmissioner, and the British Admiral. He (Sir John Bakington) had carefuly read that correspondence, and he had read it with the deepest pain. He could not recollect any Parliamentary papers connected with public affairs which he had read with such feelings of sorrow as those. He wished to be understood that he abstained from committing himself to any definite opinion upon this subaect, for further explanation might yet be offered; but he hoped that on the meeting of P'arliament some satisfactory explanations would be given, and that if we were to be in. volved in costly and bloody wars in distant parts of- the globe we should be satisfied in England that we had the cause of jubtice on our side. (Hear, hear.) He zefrained, in the present condition of affairs, from offering any decided opinion, and would not give excpressions, as he otherwise sould do, to the indignation which he should feel if it was ound that we had been involved in the cruel act of bombarding a peaceful city, destroying a number of its inhabitants, and stopping its trade for causes which, as far as the despatches showed, were utterly unjustifiable. (Cheers.) Whether these acts on our part were wise and just or not, they might have arisen from the indiscretion of officers at a distance, involvingusincomplicationswhichtheGovernnent at home might find it very difficult to extricate itself from. These matters, they must see, had a bearing upon the question of the mode of raising the revenues of the country. He admitted it was his duty as their representative, and the duty of every man who had the honour of sitting in the House of Commons, to see that no unnecessary taxation was imposed on the people, and, above all, to see that there was no unjust taxation. (Cheers.) But the members of the House of Commons had another duty to perform-i.e., to see that the necessary supplies were not withheld from our gracious Qneen vhen they were necessary to the security of this great kingdom. (Applause.) The following resolution was nextput to the meeting, and carried unanimously " That the present noome-tax liwa are mischievously constituteo, and so fauLcious in principle, that iniusUre aod oppresion meaut be the necessary result: and that tI direct taxation is necessary ie muay roarsreadllyboelevied, with anearer approach to absolute Justice by mneans of a anaU property-tax." A resolution adopting a petition to Parliament for a total repeal of the income-tax laws was then passed, and Sir John Paington, at the request of the meeting, consented to present it to the House of Commons. A vote of thanks to the chairman concluded the pro. ceedings.

THE LOSS OF THE ALAIL-PACKET VIOLET. TO THE EDITOR OF TBE TIMES. Sir,-I feel convinced that, with youLr characteristic spirit of charity and benevolence, you will not refuse insertion to the followng letter, addressed to me by Lieutenant. General Sir P. Cockban with reference to tho distressing less of the Violet and her gallant crew. He has placod their claims upon public sympathy in so forcible a light that it would beo superfluous to add another word beyond the fact that the lat comnmander and his crew have car-ried safely in the course of their career in the pub. lic service about 100,000 persons across, the Channel between Dover and Calais and Dover and Ostend. Permit me, in allusion to the paragraph in Ltye Pims of this dlay, copiedl from the Examincn-, merely to remark that the commander of the Violet would doubtle have acted with more regard to the safety of himself,f his vessel, and crew if he had waited at Osen for daylight ; but ho bad his mails shiipped, he had a fair wind; he conceived he had a duty to perform to the public; he never supposed thaLt a snowstorm could last for five or six hours; he had a good chance of mak-ing a quick passage; he did not deem himself justified in rejeoting such a chance ; ho attempted to tako advantage of it, but by some most fatal error-au error, I believe, owing to the too freu t mistak-ing of lihts-he and his fine crew have Iama suLre the appeal to those who have made pleasant trip ad weathered many a gale with poor Captain Lyne and his crew will not be made m vei. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant. T. qP.MTPP Mall Paclket Service, Dover, Jan. 12. "East Cliff, Dover, Jan. 9. "Dear Smithett,-I omitted to ask yesterday whether onintend putting into the London papers an appeal in MM of the widows and orphans who have been left destituto by the loss of the Violet ? "These unfortunates, it does appear to me, are as fully entitled to pubUc relief as those of the army and navy wlho were killed m Action or died in hospitals in the Critnea. "The 'wreck of the Violet is quite distinct from the general class of 'wrecks, inasmuch as it was entirely caused bya zealous and gallant determination to fulfil a public duty, and I do think if so stated in the London papers a h'rgo sbscription would bo made there. It was xthe desire duly to fu~l6 the contract made 'with the country that led to the sad result. *CYours truly " FRANCIS COOKBURN."
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Tho endless discussions on the drainage of London are enough to sicken us in every sense of the word. In aU the corporation speeches there are not ten words to the noot orpurpose. The best judgment of Parliament, tho best engineers iathe country wil be required to I.eth this subject - else the result of any tograp *th failuro and oisasterWhat has to be done must be done in a way to be beyond doubt of results at beginning, or middl, or end, and with no regard to expenditure. Are we to spend milions on war and destruction, and hundreds of thousands on smch abortions as the Thames Tunnel, and then to be debating about saviuS a spilion or two in secturing a wholesome atmosaherotot wealthiest city in the world? ~ qts n The half measure of laying our filtih at our neighbours door ebout Erith, or any place so near, would, as such an act ought to do, recoil upon ourselves. Evcry east wind would bring a pestilential air over London, worse a thousandfold than can come of the present pIan of getting the soil at once under water; besides, I doubt vouz Rower of carrying your filth to any spot on the baurLk Thames; every parish and township for miles aiuii buld have their action against London for a nuisance. When we think, too, that every vessel coming up the Thames must pass through the pestilential stench, one is utterly amazed at the thing being mooted at all. The work to be done is a great one. Do it partially and you will spend 2,OOO,0001. and find you will want 4,OOO,0001 to correct the mischief you have done. Be Romans for once a selwers and aqueducts. Do something effectivouaud trust John Bull for the cost. Give him for once something to Pay forthat is not a blutider. Continue your sewers to the sea and make your plan grand and complete for ever. When London is entirely cleansed, the 3lechifamners wil still find manure enough and to spare. lIalfthediseases of our plantst come of over-inanuring, and if your corpooration carry out their dirty notions of dealing{n soil, and oceupyinganypart of thelimnks of the Thamnes in the deodorizing process forthe benefit of field or garden,ist win1 only end in our eating oisonous food, in our Dreathing poisonous air-in stench an) cholera.
