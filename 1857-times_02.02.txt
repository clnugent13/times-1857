The boat'screw wore not sailor', but carpenter. tailor s,hvemakere. and blacksmta hs, who bpAi devoted themselves for a lonc timne to the siervice 0t inanning their beat in. time of danger, and had raved soame hundreds of lives.
At last, n the 4thi of January, they launched their beat never to return, and they left ntine widows and their children, and several old people who were dependent upon them, to the care of those who can appreciate the bravery and the seltfsacrifLclng heroism withL which they 'went out at any risk to the rescue,

'Public attention is called to the following facts
It has been reeently stated in Parliament that there "are 20,030 victims to prcetitution in London. It is established by hospita returus, and confirmed by medical experience, that the average duration of the lives of these outcaste is only from ifive to seven years ; runiequenily at least 3.500 of them die every year. Of the few Iteformatories in lNndon two~ had,~en closed for want of supoort. During the Past year no less than 2,50 penitents had been turned from ttoe dooms because there were no funids to give them food."
Portlier fascts.-It in found that numbers of these outca-Is have been the victims of an organized trade, having beenl decoyed to Lozndon unider the promise of honourableaservice. Mtany of them have been ensnared under 15 years of age. Maniy have returned home in their first re morse, but liave bern thsown barSc again on their sinfutl life by harsh or injudicious treatment. In the end they perish, chietly from consumption. anld nut untrequently Irom actual want and cold dstring the w'ntor mouthis.
Such ame some of the appalling facts of proedtuiulon. Is there any reniedy

Money-Market and City Intelligence.
MO13RY-MARBET aod CITYI -fEP;LLIGBNCB,
Saturday Evening.
The funds have agaian fallen to-day, but in the afternoon there was a partial reaction owing to the arrival of nearly 600,0001. by the Mexican steamer and an improvement on the Paris Bourse. Consols for money, which left off yesterday at 93 to j, were first quoted 924 to 93, whence they declined to 924 to @, rumours being prevalent that sorne of the persons who have lately been large operators for an advance both in ConsolFs and Turkish Six per Cents. find a difficulty under the present high rates for money in carrying forward their speculations to the next account. Upona largepurchase by the broker to the Court of Chancery a rally then occurred to 93 to t, but the closing price was exactly 93. For the 5th of March the Lsst transactions were at 93~ to i. Bank Stock left off at 216 to 218; Redced, 91 to jl; New Three per Cents., 93A to ; India Stock, 218 to 220; Exchequer-bonds, 98i to 99; and India Bonds and Exchequer-bills, 3s. iscount to par.
In the Stock-Exchange the rate for loans on Government securities was 6 to 6i per cent. In the discount-market and at the Bank there was rather less pressure, but the highest rates recently current were fully maintained.
About 56,0001. in gold was taken from the Bank to-day for exportation.
Foreign securities were very heavy in the early part of the day, Turkish particularly being affected by sales. Subsequently there was a slight recovery. In Turkish Six per Cents. the operations were at 924 and 93 for money, and 924, 92, and 93i for the account. The Four per Cen's. Guaranteed were negotiated at 1024 for money, and 102i and i for the account. The general transactions comprised Mexican for account, 21ft; and Spanish Newr Deferred, 234. Spanish Certificates were firmer, purchases baving taken place at 64 and ft per cent.
The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Boiuse this evening were 67f. 80c. for money, and 67f. 60c. for the account, showing a recovery of nearly a half per cent., consequent upon the transactions connected with the arrangement of the monthly liquidation.
The letters from Paris state that dulness and uncertainty continues to prevail on the Bourse, and that the bullion in the Bank of France is diminishing. M. Mires, the contractor for the recent Spanish loan, proposed to visit London on Monday with the
.iewr of negotiating a settlement with the holders of confiscated coupons, so as to obtain a removal of the ban against the introduction of Spanish securities in this market and that of Amsterdam.
In the present state of the exchanges gold can be sent to Paris, but a small quantity will probably suffice to restore the quotation. The Bank of France will doubtless be large purchasers out of the next Australian arrivaL
The specie brought by the Atrato to-day from Mexico and the West Indies amounts to 585,0001., of which 462,0001. is silver and 122,0001. gold. This arrival has caused the market for silver to become very filat, and the importation of 5f. pieces from the continent will probably cease.
The Royal Mail steamer Parana, which sails on the 2d for the West Indies, will take out 66,0001., the whole, with the exception of 6,0001., being gold.
Annexed is a table of the fluctuations in stocks and shares during the month just ended. The range of Consols has been limited to 14 per cent., but it has been entirely in a downward direction. The improvement established during the two preceding months has therefore been almost wholly lost. The expectation entertained in December, when the Bank lowered their rate of discount to 6 per cent., that it would be some time before any further reduction could be looked for has been realized, the tendency during the entire period having been towards an iacreased demand. At the same time it has been equally shown by the experience of 3ix or seven weeks that the call for the reduction was perfectly proper, and that to maintain the charge of 6i per cent. throughout that interval, merely because it might become necessary to revert to it in a month or two, would have been a violation of sound principle and a great injustice to the commercial body:-

On the Paris Boure, notwithatanding the recent gloom, the transactions of the month have resulted in establishing a rise of more than I per cent. At Ansterdam the market has wcarcely experienced even a fractional alteration. At Vienna there has been a slight recovery.
Subjoined are the railway calls for the month of Febriary, so far aM they have yet been advertised:-
*J2he aavices trom the city of Mexico to-day reach to the 2d of January, and are not encouraging. Although the suppression of the Puebla revolt and the simultaneous pacification of the provinces on the Texan frontier by the submission of Vidaurri had relieved the Government from some of its worst difficulties, new sources of anxiety had immediately developed themselves. The efforts of the President, General Comonfort, to establish order and uphold moderate principles continued to be thwarted by the ceaseless intrigues of the clergy and the Reactionist party on the one hand, and the wild views of the extreme Democrats on the other. Under the eircumstances, it was very doubtful if he could hope to maintain a middle course. The belief was that, in case of his being forced to a change, he would choose the Democratic side. The most pressing evil of the moment arose from the position assumed by the mulatto, General Alvarez, the Governor of the province of Guerro, who, thwarted by Congress in some attempts to extend his authority, had incited his followers to ravage several of the principal districts of the country. A series of atrocities had thus been committed which had excited a general panic. Many of his people are alleged to be notoriolus criminals, and he himself, from his sanguinary disposition, has long borne the title of " the panther of the south." The latest intelligence was that a valuable plantation near Cuernavaia had been surprised, and several Spaniards butchered, the cjhief of them, M. Bermegillo, having vainly offered 8,0001. to save his life. The animosity of Alvarez seems chiefly directed against the purely Spanish partof the population, and " Death to the Spaniards!" is the cry he has raised. The principal portion of them have therefore taken flight, abandoning their homes and property, and M. Sorela, the Spanish Charg6 d'Affaires, has consequently intimated to the Government that unless vigorous measures of repression are at once adopted the relations between the two countries will be seriously jeopardized. In the midst of these perplexities a fresh outbreak, promoted probably by the clergy, had occured in San Luis, and the Goverpnment were sending troops in that direction ffjom various pioinbs. With regard to the newv Amerias Minister, It iS obaerved by a Mexiean writer, '$,Er. Forsyth sieems detemned to outshine his predecessors in dispensing with every principle of courtesy not only withlthelIlexican Government, but also with the other foreign representatives." Hitherto, i; is added, "all 1is relations with the co7ps diplo1a have conisted in a simple exchange of cards, Mr. Forsyth having thought proper to waive all personal interpure, evyn the simple risitAO 4k riVur demanded
ly diplomatic etiquette." At the same time hs announces to the Mexicans that he has large aud important claims to urge against them. The general trade of the republic is described to be in a deplorable condition, while, as respects the foreign debt, the immediate prospects seem worse than ever. " All the money belonging to the bondholders," it is remarked, "is regularly seized by* the Govern - ment in the most unceremonious manner, and Mrl.
Lettsom's remonstrances are merely laughed at" |
In the tea-market to-day, some holders having 1 shown a disposition to realize, there was a tendency i to reaction. A few sales of common congou were effected at Is. Id. per lb.
In the Court of iQueen's Bench yesterday another of those questions regarding the Roval British Bank which seerm likely to go on until the assets of the bank and the means of all the unhappy persons connected with it shall have been entirely distributed among the legal profession, was heard before Lord Campbell. A shareholder against whom a judgment had been obtained by a creditor of the bank sought to resist execution, on the plea that he had been induced to purchase his shares by the fraudulent representations of the directors, and that consequently, so far from being liable for the debts of the bank, he was himself entitled to rank among the claimants against it. The Court, however, decided that whatever foundation there might be for this charge, it could not affect the liability of the defendantto the general creditors. He might possiblyhave his redress against his fellowpartners, the original shareholders, by whose neglect or misrepresentations he had been induced to invest his money, but having performed partnership acts, such as receiving dividends, &c., and his name being upon the register, his responsibility to the public could not be questioned. This decision was at the same time stated to be in concurrence with the views of the judges of the Coulrt of Common Pleas, and also of the Exchequer, before which tribunals analogous points have been raised and are now pending. Little doubt, therefore, can be entertained that proceedings against individual shareholders will henceforth be carried on without exception wherever the person is supposed to possess the slightest means. Many will leave the country, and the last property of those that remain will perhaps in a rmajority of istances not more than snfflce to pay thelaw expenses of their struggole. The, result will be that a concern wshich, if wound up by half-a-dozen merchants, and an accountant invested with proper powers, night have yielded a handsome dividend, and not have involved ruin either to the shareholders or creditors, will prove fatal to all, solely through the operation of the laws established for their protection.
The railway meetings, although not numerous, have presented some facts of interest. The directors of the London and South-Western Company propose a dividend for the half-year at the rate of 61. lOs. per cent. per annum, making, with the previous payment, 6 per cent. for the year. At the meeting of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Company the dividend of 3i per cent. for the halfyear was confirmed, and the report was adopted. The agreements for worling the West-end of London and Crystal Palace and leasing the Wimbledon and Croydon lines were sanctioned. The dividend declared at the Llanelly meeting was 11. per share, and the report and accounts were passed. The traffic continues to be steadily developed, and the main line is now in a thoroughly efficient condition. According to the report of the North Staffordshire Company,the revenue will allow of a dividend at the rate of 3i per cent. per annum, the net receipts actually realized alone being dealt with. The litigation with the London and North-Western Company is still proceeding, and the balance claimed under the 4 per cent, agreement is 67,9441. The dividend of the Eendal and Windermere Company is 2s. 6d. per share, leaving a small balance to be carried forward. A dispute with the Lancaster and
Carlisle Railway respecting the groods traffic at I Kendal is to be referred to arbitration, if the directors of both companies will consent to such a mode of settlement. At the meeting of the Railway Rolling Stock Company a dividend at the rate of 8

The Emigration Commissioners have advertised for vessels to carry emigrants to Sydney and Geelong, to be ready between the 17th and 24th of March, as may be hereafter determnned.
The following i3 from the Committee of Mexican Bondholders *
"The committee have received advices from Mtr. Whitehead dated Mexico, the 2d nlt., and referring to some of the 19th December last, which have not yet come to hand. Mr. Lerdo had esigned the Ministry of Fiuance, which had created an extraordinary sensation. The leading papers of the capital treated his retirement as the greatest of all calamities, and it was hoped, in consequence ofthemanifestation of universwlfeeling thepublio, thatthePresidentmight still succeed in averting Mr. Lerdo's retirement from office. Politics still continue someawhat unsettled. There had been a pronunciaminto at San Luis; and in the south General Alvarez's conduct had been so doubtful as to cause serious apprehensions.
" The packet brings $25,000 from Mr. Whitehead, but no other remittances, for the dividend fund."
The annexed report on the Manchester trade and the Liverpool cotton-msarket during the past month is from Messrs. Robert Barbour and Brother:-
" This market has been dull and irregular throughout the month, and those who asked extreme rates a few weeks ag-, have been obliged to lower their pretensions, but on the whole prices have been well supported. The contracts previously made have kept many spinners and manufacturers well employed, so that stocks have not materially increaaed. In the meantime the high prices current prevent business from being done, and it wi be difficult to maintain present rates except with an inproved demand; there is, however, no room to yield without a positive loss, unless the raw material gives way. It is therefore probable that the market will continue irreqular and unsettled for some time. The high prices which most kinds of raw material and foreign produce have reached, both at home and abroad, are beginnsig to interfere with the general trade of the country by curtaiuing consumption and leading to the exercise of caution from the fear of reaction. The excitement in the Liverpool cotton-market reached its highest point early in the month. ' Middling' cotton sold at 7id. per lb., which was worth 7d. a month previously. During the last three weeks only a moderate business has been done, and about ld. per lb. of the advance has been lost. Though the supply wfll be short from the Stabes there will be an increase from India. The total exports from Bombay to Europe last year were 537,000 bales against 339,000 in 1865, showing an increase of 195,000 bales, which is likely soon to be farther augmented, as a much larger propOrtiOn of the crop will come here this season than nsual on account of the disturbed state of China."
The annexed information relative to the progress of English maining adventure is condensed from the Mining Journal:-
" There has been a large business doing in a few particular miines, and in many of them a considerable rise has taken place. The late extension of the market will bring many new investors into it, although at present there is no perceptible increase. AtSouth Caradon meeting the accoaunts showed a balance in favour of the mine of 442. ; a dividend of 2,0481. and a bonus of 5121., ecual to 101. per share, was declared, and the remaining 1,8611 carried to the next account. The Eyam Lead Company have declared a dividend of 10s. per sbare. At the Etolyford meeting a dividend of 5s. per share was made, leaving a balance of 335l. to next account. At Sortridge Consols meeting the accounts showed a balance of 4,111. in favour of the mine. At East Sortridge Consols the accounts showed a balance in favour of adventurers of 401.; a call of Is. per share was made. At West Par Consols meeting the accounts showed a balance of 4501. At Wheal Dunstanville a call of 10s. per share has been made. At West Rosewarne meeting the accounts showed a balance of 1,0021. against the mine, and a call of 11. per share was made. At West Alfred Consols meeting the acconnts showed a balance against the mine of 8881. ; a call of 17s. 4d. per share was made. At North Wheal Wrey Consols meeting the accounts showed a balance against the mine of 231. At South Wheal Crofty meeting the accounts showed a balance in favour of adventurers of 1931. At Merilyn meeting the accounts showed a balance of liabilities over assets of 4281.; a call of 2s. 6d. per share wvas made. At Ivybridge meeting the accounts showed a balance against the mine, all liabilities included, of 2,5201.* a call of 3s. per share was made. At South Pboenix meeting the accounts showed a balance of 1471. against the mine to meet which a call of lod. per share was made. At Clijah and Wentworth meeting the accounts showed a balance against the mine of 63SS,; a call of 12s. 6d. per share was made. At St. Aubyn and Grylls meeting the accounts showed a balance against adventurers of 8991, a call of 18s. 4gd. was made. At Tresavean meeting tLe accounts showed a balance in favour of adventurers of 1401. At Cwn Sebon meeting a call of 2s. 6d. per share was made. At Wilow Bank meeting a call of 2s. 6d. per share was made. At Carn Vivian meeting the accounts showed a balance against adventurers of 2391.; a call of 2s. per share was made. At Boiling-well meeting the accounts showed a balance of 3701. against the mine; a call of 20s. per share was made. At Wheal Tallack meeting the accounts showed a balance in favour of adventurers of 1461. At Basset Consols meeting a call of is per share was made."
With regard to foreign mining there is nothing worthy of extract.
Among recent commercial publications have been Bradslutm's Railway Guide for 1857* and The Bussness Mcants Notebook and Desk Directoy.t Both are remarkable, and probably unequalled for the amount of information compressed by their compilers into a given spaee.

ST'ATE OF TRiADL.
MANCHESTER, JAN. 31.
The market continues in an unsatisfactory position. A good many spinlners as well as manufacturers are still workL'g on contracts placed in December, but as these expire the number of sellers increases, and there is more difficulty in maintaining prices steadily. In longoloths, T-cloths, and grinters the high rates of cotton continae to support Prices here, but for 40-inch shirtings, suited to India and China, the sales are very limited, and quotations are now 3d. to 4Qd. per piece below what they were last month. "4The eiports of cotton piece goods and yarns for the month," gays the monthly circular of Messrs. Itobert Freeland and Brother of this day, "are 81,136 packages against 85,686 for the same time last year, This is considerably under the average for the previous three months, which is 93,441
BIRMINGHAM, JAN. 31.
There is little alteration in the state and future prospeckq of the Sonth Staffordshire iron districts. Prices are well supported. The second-class mrakers appear to have come round to the opinion that the present demand and high prices of pigs testify an advance, and there is consequently a smaler margin between the rates of the first houses and thaose of mnferior makers. I appears to he admitted that the scarcity of money and the present high rates of discount have checked rnanufacturing operations ;but at the same Itimne it cannot be denied that hut for this salutary preservative the district, as circumstances are, would again have been subjected to disastrous specflations, It is reinarkable that at this period of the year, when demands for Birmingham oods are usually the 8mallest, the requirements, as well for home as for foreign countries, are the largest known for many years.
TIhere is nothing new to be reported with regard to the coal trade.
The late advance in the price of copper and brass has created a considerable disturbance in that trade. A reduction of discounts has generally been adopted, bult this remedy is suited only to meet a limited advance in the cost of materiaL If the repeated recent advances, now amounting to 75 per cent. on the prices six years ago, should be continued nany of the manufacturers will be compelled, instead of further reducing their discounts, which have now become so low as scarcely to answer the puipsee for which they were intended, to issue new price bsts. This step would entail upon them considerable labour and expense. Many of the houses engaged in the general brass-foundry business make upwards of 10,000 distinct articles, a large proprtion of which are made in various sizes. Price lists and engraving s of those articles are now in the houses of |trading communities in every part of the world, and a long tbime would elapse before the substitution of the new list for the old one could be effected. WiLth one or two exceptions, i the brass founders of the town, even under present eircumstances, are busy. It mav be mentioned that the best informed of the manufacturers do not attribute the late advances in the price of copper to speculation, but to the scarcity of ore, and the greatly increased demand for al purPOses.
The factors of the town have not yet felt in any sensible degree the advance which has taken place in the price of metals; but, although orders are good, country ironmongerS hesitate to purchase except for immediate necessities. Tdr iron manufactured articles the demand is unaffected. The ordes for light steel toys are abundant, and even for heavy steel toys, such as carpenters' tools, &c,, there is a greater call than might have been expeeted.
ifMisstatemnents have appeared wvith regard to the affairs of the late Kiddermir,ster Old Bank-that of Parley and Turner. The following is trme and derived from authority. According to the statement of Mar. Brinton, the solicitor, and Mar. Kettle, the accountant to the estate, at a meeting held on Thursday evenfag, the total debts were 45,0001., and the assets abont 33,0001. Sines the last meeting the auctioneer bad stated that he should make of property valued at 35001 not less than 4,0001, and that the hank premises would make more than 5001. above the value placed upon them. The estate will, to the satisfaction of the creditos, be wound up under the Court of Chancery, and a dividend of 14s, or 1.5s. in the pound is auticipatd.
NOT IMHlAff, TAN. 31.
A considerable number of Canadian and home trade buyers have been in the local market, making selections of framework knitted goods, and their aggregate purchases have been extensive. Goodsare taken up as rapidly as they can be produced, even with the aid of the new machinery, and there are no stocks on hand. Prices are very firm. Merino yarns have advanced during the week Is. to 2s. a bundle, according to quality; and spun silk is 6d. per lb. dearer.
There is still a very great deniand for coarse plain nets, the prices of wLich are advancing weekly, and wnll continue to rise, they being scarce in the market. The rise in the p rice of cotton has at length had an effect upon fancy laces made of that material, which A-A deap.. ,1
Several Canadian buyers have been operating, and their purchases are more extensive than usual. The Germans have also been operating in the lace-market. The home trade is the quietest department of the lawe business. Cotton laces are coming into demand, owing to Brussels sleeves being in fashion. Prices of lace yarn haye again advanced, and silk is so dear thatit is difficalt to name a price high enongh to buy it. A large number of lace machines are belughuilt, many additional factories are about to be erected, and during the last few months the number of wFarehouses opened for business by ncevly-formed firms is matter of astonishnietit. Al1 are so fully occupied that additional operatives are continually being brought from other districts, and even now there is such a demand ,or female labour that domestic servants cannot be had at anything like ordinary wages.
LEICESTER, JAN, 31.
Trade is dull, manufacturers only makimg to order, as a proportioiate advance with the price of material cannot be obtained. The operatives are but partially employed, and the dearness of cotton has operated against the usual preparations for the spring demand. Wools re firm.
LEEDS, JAR. 3I.
The woollen cloth trade continues brisk, the great bulk of the hands in this district being well employed, and manufacturers finding a ready market for their productions. The bome trade is steady, and the shipping houses are increasing in business. A good sale is found for light fabrics suitable for ladies wear. bleltons and other goods of that class also sell well. There was a full average attendance of buyers in the cloth-halls this morning, and they bought freely; but the lowness of the stocks does not allow scope for very extensive operations. Prices are very firm, with an upward tendency. Wools sell well, despite their continued advance, and the stocks are fast passing into use.
The market has been steady, but notactive to-day. Wool, yarns, and worsted continue firm in price, and as spring approaches the demand for yarns increases. In goods, Orleans and mottles meet with ready sale, and a good deal of damask baaslately been sold.
BRADFORD, JAN. 31.
In the worsted trade the piece department does not manifest much improvement. On the one hand, merchants continue to act with extreme caution, and restrict their orders to little else than goods absoluwely necessary for the supply of their immediate wants; and, on the other hand, the manniacturers, who experience the greatest difficulty in obtaining the requisite enhancement of rates consequent on the full quotations of both worsted and cotton yarns, do not press sales, but rather display an inclination to curtail the pro. duction until the establishment of a more equitable range of prices. The yarn trade is in much the same position; the difference between the rates offered to spinners and the actual cost of the raw material operates against extensive transactions, and, as spinners are chiefly working to order, prices will not find their proper level until the completioa of present contracts. Transactions in wvorsted yarns are therefore hlmited, while the firmness of prices ruling for cotton in Lancashire markets has its expected effect here.
Inl both t}.ese branches of the staple trade the operations of the klst five weeks have been more numerous than exrtensive, and the business of the month closes with much difference of opinion as to the course to be adopted in the
The wool-market manifests considerable excitement. T'here is an active demand for combing wools, the extreme figures demanded in the wool-producing districts keep the stocks within a narrow compass, and prices of all descriptions are fully sustained; long-stapled qualiftes are quite as dear, and the rates obtained for middlinu e
slightly in favour of the staplexs; still sales are below the average, occasioned by the firmness of holders and buyers limiting themselves to positive wants. Stocks of foreign are exceedingly low, and prices obtained have.an upward tendency. An impression gains ground that speculation has added to the difficulty experienced in this department.
At the annual meeting of the Chamber of Commerce for the Bradford and Halifax worsted district the subject of the dearness of the raw material and the probabilities of increasing the supply of wool and cotton received consideration, and it was suggested that the Bradford merchants should ioin those of Manchester in impressing upon Government the importance of promoting the extended cultivation of cotton in India.
NOR IC, 31,
The shoe trade of this city continues in an active state, although the manufacturers complain greatly of the rise in the prices of leather. At Bungay the employers have held a meeting, and determined upon advancing the prices of their goods; and in doing this they have only followed t:e example of otber places.
With reference to the general manufacturing busminess of Norwich few complaints are heard, and it isstated that good orders have been received for the spring. The condition of the operative classes is altogetber better than at the corresponing period of last year, the prices of the necessaries of life being lower, while there is at least an equal amount of employment.

SACRED HARMONIC SOCIETY.
The rerformsaoe of Zliah on Friday night was on t
whole Tremarkablv good, so -much so indeed as to c.coUrage the hope that it will nob be the only one durinz the present series of concerts whvich ws anticipated. Tne ap.
earnce of MKr. and3 Mrs.~oeey, two of the most genuine sigers in sacred music whom we possess, was also iuterest. ig, from the fact of their having been included in the oigiaial "casP-if the expression may be Salowed with reference to a acred musica drama-when the work was produced at the Birmmngham Festival of 6184. Iusteai of the unaccom med trio, " Lift thine eyes," which forms one of the additions, or oather changes, made by Men4els. sohn ater the first performance. it may be remembered there was a duet for female voices, set to tbh same words. This was entrusted to the M Ases a nd AL %Nil. liams, who then enjoyed a reputation as duet singers whlich brought their names into universal popularity. The elder is Eince married and retired from public life. The younger, Mr Lockey, having selected a partner in one of the worthiest members of her own profession, contintues to. sing at concerts-for which amateurs have reason to be thankfil, since in her particular line she has few, if any, superiors. Lat night Mr Lockey, in place of the sabordinate part assigned to her '0 years ago as Miss Mar-tla Willias$, undertook the prinpal contraUo mrusio-with the exception of a recitative ("Nor Chezith's brook") and an air ("Woe unto them"), which were verv carefully given by the young and asidduous Miss PalmeTr, to whom the second contraito part in the concerted music was allotted. Without entering into details, we mty say that Mrs Lockey was quite equal to her task, and that generally spea weng we have never heard the contralto music in mERjah sung more correctly or with more admirable taste. "Oh rest in the Lord" was quite perfect - and in the fine declamatory dialogue between Jezebel and the people one or two new readings were observed, which, though-differing from antecedents (and from,our own vievr of what Mendelssohn intended}, were decidedly effective. In summingup the catSlogue of wrongs which the wicked Queen prefers against *^ah-whose destruction by the hands of the infuriate crowd she is designing-Jezebel has to say, "He also closed the heavens," and "He called dovm a famine upon the land." These sentences were pronounced by Mr Lockey in a slower measure, and with an ar_eot of deep sorrow, the meaning of which was as intelligible as the mauner of delivery was felicitous. Nevertheless we must insist that this interpretation of the scene-if -Mendel-ohn's arrangement is to be takeninto consideration-is erro'neous. Jezebelgrsdnallyexcites the populace torageanda dcsirefor vengeance, heaping up accusations against the hostile prophet with continually increasing vehemence. Bach clause (and so the music illustrates it) tells with greater weigh nh itc nt;l fhe whole cullminates in the feroe and
augry exclamation of the popalace-" Woe to hi,la !-he shall perish !"-painted by Mendelssohn with that amirnzag power of which, in attempting to give musical expresion to, the blind frenzy of a multitude, he has afforded several examples. Jezebel, in short, affords herself no time for vain regrets; and were she ever so desirous on her own acn unt, the people, whom she has artfully e-asperated, woald4wlow her little chance for indulging in them. Neverthele-s, this new reading of Mr Lockeyshowsthatlike Madame Viardot Garcia, she thinks seriously of what she is about to sing, and when she is wrong only errs from the laudable motive of wishing to do too welL
M r. Lockey sang the tenor airs and recitatives with th*t chaste and true sentiment which won for him the beartily avowed approbation of Mendelssohn himself, who was as averse to the exaggerations and liberties too often ventread on by singers as Hamlet to the inordinate gestares and verbal improvisations of players, and quite as logical in his objections. Madame Clara Novello sang the chief soprano. part as finely as on any previous occasion. In the qasartet, with chorus, " Holy, ho]y. holy t!-the grandest and at the same time the simplest nausical embodiment of the " Sanetus"-ber superb voice camie upon the ear of the vast, assembly with an effect as thrillng as it was clear and penetrating. Mr. Weiss, who has often been praised for his artistic execution of the very arduous music of the pr phet, Elijah-which, besides arL immense number of difflicat recitatives, and a large sabae in the morceavx d'e2isembi, comprises no less than four airs, resembling each other in nothimg-perhaps never deserved commendation more entirely thnn last ninht, when be sang thsrough his long par 'wita unabated zealanad energy totfhe eud. The subordinate sin;ers wvere Mr.Temple, Messrs. Walker, Barnbv and! Smythson. The double quartet, "For He shall give His angels charge went wrelL."
The choruses were for the most p~irt satisactory a and two of them especially-" Woe to him, he shall per-sh !" and "Behold! God the Lord passed by"-with which (like " The people shall bear" and "With the blast of thy nostrils" in Israel itn gpt ) we have nearly always to find fault-far more so than usual. As, we believe, Elijah isnow ordinarily given -vithott any full rehearsal, the members being supposed as familiar with it as with Te Messai', it behoves all the executants, vocal and instrunsental (particularly the non-professionals) to be unremittingly watchful, or, as was now and then proved in yesterday evexiing's otherwise csaptal performance, " slips," here and there, are inevitable. We are not ofthe opinion of those who would suppr
all applauseand demonstrations of approval during the perforniances of the Sacred Harmonic Society. since Bxeter HaU is not a church and the performances are not servic&s but concerts. The applause, however,s hould be so axded as not to interrupt the progress of the mnusiC, or detroy ita effect in places of inporstnce; and encores should be abo. lished altogether. 'Chere was an attempt to encore the trio, "ILift thine eyes," which was perfectly sung by Ka, dame Novello, Miss Palmer, and Mrs. Iacksv, and another to obtain a repetitionof "Oh rest intheLord' (sung byMrs. I.oekey); but we were plaed to find that blr. Costa pro. ceeded with the next pieces as if no such indiscreet demands had been expressed.

GREYTOWN, J. 6.
'The last intelligence which you received from Nicaragua described the perilous position of General Bei 2m)gsen in Grenada, and afforded some ground for iipposing that the fortunate star of General Wslker vwas beginning to decline. Since then events bave occurred which have effected a more serious chainge in his prospects than could even at that tiune have been anticipated, though the danger has aritt-ii ia another quarter. Before proceeding to des- iibe it, however, it is necessary to say that by a ekil]ul movement Walker succeeded, with only 160 me., in relieving General Henningsen, who, with a force, of 400 men, had for 19 days defended himself with the utmost heroism, although closely pressed by an army of 3,000 allied troops. Having thoi onghly routed these, Walker effected his retreat upon Rivas, and by the latest accounts we learn that he is in that town with 800 men, not including sick aiid wounded, while the generals of the allied awn , disheartened by the unsuccessful attempt to capture Henningsen and the ammunition and stori s which were in Grenada, had quarrelled amov g themselves, and had retired in the direction of Leon. Meantime a small reinforcement of 80 men arrived from California at Rivas, where a quantity of provisions were in store, so that Walker considered his situation to be less critical than it had been since his arrival in the country. Just how-ver, in the midst of his fancied security, a blow4as struck where he was least prepared for it, and intelligence of which it is probable he has not yet received. In the person of one of his own coi ntrymen, General Walker has an enemy more bitter and powerful than any President of a Central American Republic. Mr. Vanderbilt considers himself defrauded of his property by the sale of the transit stock to Randolph by General Walker; the circumstances of this transaction are doubtless familiar to you. That property had since passed into the hands of Messrs. Morgan and Garrison who have hitherto conveyed reinforcements to Walker while they were carrying passengers to California. For this purpose seven steamers were employed. Fii e of these were flat-bottomed river boats, with stenm wheels, and two were lake steamers, which had, with incredible difficulty, been dragged up to Lal,e Nicaragua. Upon uninterrupted communication with Greytown, by means of the river San Juan. Walker depended entirely for his supplies and reinforcewents. Mr. Vanderbilt, desirous of regaining possession of the property which Walker had coafi-cated, has for some time past been secretly engaged in making arrangements with the Costa Rican Government, with the view of obtaining their assistance in seizing the river and lake steamers-a proposal highly palatable to the Costa Ricans, who at once agreed in a scheme which enabled them to cut (ff all Walker's supplies. The expedition, consisti g of upwards of 200 men, left San Jose on the 5th ot December, under the charge of a Mr. Spencer, an agent of Mr. Vanderbilt, and, after a laborious march of 200 miles, reached the em6arradero on the San Carlos river, which they descended by means of flats and canoes constructed on the spot to the San Juan. The first and most imp' rtant point of attack was the Fort of Serapiqu6, about 30 niles from this place, and which is conaidered the strongest position on the river. It was garrisoned by 40 Americans under Captain Thompson. This officer, although informed that rafts filled with Costa IRicans had been seen upon the niver, through some unaccountable negligence allowed himself to be surprised at midday on the 22d of last month. Most of the American soldiers panic-stricken,rushedinto the water,where theywere eith, r drowned or shot; others were bayonetted on the spot; 10 alone out of 40 survive and have been brought dowvn here. Imnediatelv after this succesrful a-sault Spencer descended in his canoes to this p lace, where four of the river steamers were lying. Tnhe e he s,urprised before daylight in the morning of the w3d. The suddenness of the seizure and the unexpected aDpearance of a number of armed Costa Ricans rendered any attempt at resistance by the few unarmed men in charge hopeless, and in a few hours afterwards Spencer was steaming back again up the river with the four steamers which were intended to convey the reinforcements daily expected from New York and New Orleans to WaJker. Reascending the San Juan to the fort of Serapiqu6, Spencer left three of his steamers there, and placed a strong garrison in the place, for his small force was now augmented by 500 men, and proceeded up the river to Castilho, where the inhabitants mistook him for the regular transit-boat. At this spot there are only a few huts and taverns, and the population offered no resistance. Some miles higher up the river is Toro, the commencement of the lake navigation, where a small steamer used for crossing the rapids and the lake steamer werelying. To this point a trusty messenger was despatched by land, who represented himself as being sent by the captain of the transit boats with instructions to come down the river to Castilho. Suspecting nothing, the small steamner descended the rapids to the spot, where Spencer was quietly waiting to take possession, which he did the more readily as he found that the captain and engineer of the lake boat were accidentally on board. This rendered the capture of that boat itself a simple matter, and in it Spencer ascended to Fort San Carlos situated upon Lake Nicaragua at the debouchure of the river. Here he hoisted the usual signal, and invited some of the unsuspecting garrison on board, at the same time sending a party of 75 men to the rear of the foit. The principal officers of the fort were seized i^mediately upon their coming on board, and the Costa Ricans rushng upon it fromn the rear took the fort without the smallest resistance being offered to them. Nothing now remained to be taken but -the lake steamer coming from Virgin Bay with 400 Californian passengers on board. fIer capture was effected with the same consummate dexterity which has characterized all Spencer's proceedings. The usual signals were made by the C'osta Rican garrison as she passed San Carlos. Suspecting nothing, she proceeded some miles down the river to a point *here Spencer's steamer was lying under the bank; he sent a message on board ostensibly to inform the captain that he was detained by an imperfection in the machinery, but really to ascertain whether he was likely to meet with formidable resistance. Finding that, with the exception of 30 sick and wounded men from Walker's armyn, there were only Californians anxious to reach their destination on board, he ran his steamer alongside, and, to the astonishment of the passengers, informed them that he, together with 50 Costa Ricans, would be their escort to Greytown. He consequently arrived the day before yesterday at this place, and had scarcely landed his passengers when he perceived the Texas aiving from New Orleans. Xnowing tbat she was bringing large reinforcements to Walker, he lost no time in preparing to escape up the river. Before doing so, however, he determined to ascertain the amnount of the force, and crossing over to Point Arenas anchored in shoal water within 200 yards of the spot at which the Texas dropped her anchor. On board this steamer 250 armed men in the utmost -excitement were making preparations to capture the hardy little craft which had already achieved so much. The pilot had informed them as they crossed the bar of the state of affairs, and they perceived that unless they could succeed in effecting this all chance of reaching Walker was hopeless. Theyhad just decided on their plan of action when the little boat got up steam and vanished slowly round the green point, which, covered with luxuriant foliage, stretches across the river at the head of the bay. At this moment the disappointed passengers of the Texas are working indefatigably at sundry old scows
vnicn a tew cdays' labour may render available for the ascent of the river. They are hardy, determined men, led by officers who have already served in many a hard-fought field, and if the re-capture of -the forts and steamers and ascent of the river is possible, they are not the men to be
foiled. On the other hand, it is reported that I Spencer is fortifying Serapiqu6, and it is resolved to -contest every point upon the river, and, if hard pressed, ultimately to burn the steamers. Walker, although his army is in good fighting condition, has no mean of transporting it across the lake, and, -moreover, is fully occupied in protecting Rivas. Everything, therefore, must depend upon the exertions of the last arrivals. The steamer Tennessee is hourly expected from New York with a reinforcement of 150 men, but her non-appearance gives some ground for supposmng that there is truth in the rumours of her arrest by the Government which were rife at New Orleans before the departure of the Texa.
The lnglish squadron, under the command of ptain Erskine, of the Orion, .has abstained from taking any share whatever in these proceedings; the only desire on the part of the Britiah authorities
I ere has been to prevent bloodshed, and, while i xpressing their determinatiot to this effect to both parties, they have not, fortunately, been obliged to take forcible measures against either.

DUBLIN, SATURDAY MORNING. THE INCOM,E-TAX.
Several meetings have been held this week to denounce the continuance of the war ninepence, and other demonstrations are in progress for the ensuing week; so that before the Parliamentary session is a week old the Legislature will be in full possession of the sentiments of the Irish people with regard to the injustice of the impost in its present shape. Here, as well as in England, there has been a fair share of nonsense spoken about the difference between direct and indirect taxation, and a vast amount of crotchety arguments put forwardinsustaiament of the several speakers' views; but, bating this hair splittintg, there has been awonderful unanimity displayed at all the meetings with respect to the main object-the reduction of the tax, and a return to the rate levied before the commencement of the war.
EXCU31BERED ESTATES COURT.
The Encumbered Estates Court is invalided, and the business is brought well nigh to a deadlock by the indisposition of the two commissioners. Mr. Longfield was taken ill on Wednesday or Thursday, and two small sales yesterday were conducted by Mr. Carey, the secretary. Mr. Hargreave's attack is said to have been a serious one of bronchitis ancd dysentery, from the effecta of which he is as yet by no means recovered. A petitioner in the court states in the public journals that at the time of Baron Richards's dismissal "there were 700 petitions pending in his office; that there were 500 abstracts of title lying in his chambers unread, which must be read and considered before the estates comprised in those abstracts can be sold; 200 final schedules unsettled, which must be settled and adjudicated upon before one farthing of the proceeds of the sales of the estates which those schedulesrelate to can be distributed to the parties entitled." And yet it is patent to the whole public that a more efficient, zealous, and untiring judge than the learned baron who was placed at the head of the most remarkable tribunal of modern times could not have been chosen for the office. Great and overwhelming must have been the pressure of work when, with all his assidtiity, such an arrear of business was left at the close of eight years' labours.
MR. JUSTICE KEOGH.
The papers announce that Mr. Justice Keogh has been for some days on the sick list, and unable to discharge his duties in the Court of Common Pleas. The right hon. gentleman was to have been entertained on Wednesday by the University Club, the committee paying no regard to the threatening notice which had been served upon them by a Dublin Derbyite journal. Mr. Keogh's indisposition, however, prevented his acceptance of the proffered compliment.
THE KINGSTON ESTATES.
A curious case of alleged forgery of a lease has been for some days before the Court of Chancery, the arguments upon which terminated yesterday, the actual issue being still undecided. A petition was filed by John Uondonn a humble man of the farming class, residing in the county of Cork, to enforce the specific performance of an agreement in vwriting for a lease, dated in the year 1840, of about 30 acres of land. The defence relied on was forgery, and the circumstances-oef the case were peculiar. On the part of the petitioner it was contended that the agreement in question, which was on a half-sheet of note paper, was executed by the Earl of Kingston, and in support of his case he produced two witnesses, Mr. T. O'Brien and Mr. Marshal Sadleir, to prove the handwriting of the respondent, which was almost entirely obliterated. Mr. O'Brien swore, on a tied voce examination, that he believed the document to be genuine, and Mr. Sadleir deposed that he also believed it to be genuine, having seen it frequently many years ago, when it was perfectly legible. On the part of the Earl of Kingston it was insisted on the last day the case was before the Court that the alleged agreement was a forged instrument, and that no relief should be given upon it ; and an application was then made to let the case stand, to enable the respondent's witnesses to see the document and depose to the handwriting at an adjourned hearing. The Chancellor having allowed the case to stand for the purpose suggested, on the respondent paying the costs of the day, it came on for hearing again yesterday, when Mr. John M. Cantwell, the respondent's solicitor, Mr. Cluffe, and Mr. Cooper were severally examined, vivd voce, on the part of Lord Kingston, and they all swore that to the best of their beliet the alleged agreement was a forgery. The Chancellor said he had great difficulty in dealing with a case where the evidence was so conflicting, and he would therefore direct an issue, if the petitioner desired it, to try the genuineness of the document, when both the petitioner and Lord Kingston could be examined.
sPI}UT OF THE II NATION."
Youmg Ireland being now a myth,-the shadow of a substance-its former organ, the Nation, has ceased railing at the male portion of the Saxon aristocracy, and, with a taste and discrimination which wil no doubt be duly estimated, turns a gall-dipt pen against three illustrious ladies, who are coolly held up to popular odium as the real oppressors of the governed classes, Beginning wvith high quarry, the Queen herself is selected as the first object of attack:
It is a maxim of the constitution that the King 'eau do no vrong,' but the inerrancy is nowhere attributed to a Queen; consequently, we are in no danger of going outside the bonndaries of legality in what we are about to say. We say, then, that not content with administering the affairs of the empire through her responsible Ministers; not content with being head of the State and head of the church, with sitting on the bench, and appearing, at tha same time, as a suitor before it ; with commanding the land forces and brandishing Britannia's trident o'er the waves-not content with discharging vicariously the multifarious and heterogeneous duties which her office impss on her, Her Ma. *esty has contenptuousl repudiated the formal ictions of
awv, and insisted npon ing every inch a Queen. Who, let us ask, dictated the Durham letter? Who toid somebody to rail at 'a domineering priesthood,' and upon another occasion more boldly to aver that I the British constitution was on its trialn' Who, openly assuming a nilitary uniform, wearing a red riding-habit and a general's plume, foists incapable orderlies into high and important places at the Horse Guards ? Who-but we shall go no further. Our loyalty shrinks from the ungrateful task of recounting the imperfections of the best of Sovereigns. It is, in truth, an unpleasant dnty we have undertaken. It does violence to our gallantryas Irishmen to say anything disagreeable to a lady "
The sister of the Queen's Irish Viceroy is the next victim:
"We come now to the Duchess of Sutherland. Ostensibly her Grace fills the position of Mistress of the Robes; but we ask, with all humility, do the duties of that office require the supervision-nay, the assumption-of the garb peculiar to our sex? Is it the business of the Mistress of the Robes to govern Ireland, to control the colonies, to preside at the Council, to be paramount at the Post-office ?
f not, what a curious chance it is which distributes aU these great offices among near relatives of her Grace E It is rather remarkable, too, that, when any change in official arrangements is contemplated the interests of the CarlisleSutherland cornexion are those which seem to be primarily looked to. If brother George thinks of leaving Ireland, it is to exchange with cousin Granville, who wants a ohanoc of air. Bur, in fact, there is no sphere of authority "m which her Grace's influence is not felt."
The third victim is the wife of the Prime Minister:
" The Minister of Public Worship-a functionary of whose existence the law takes no cognizance-is Lady Palmerston. In the administration of ecclesiastical affairs her Ladyship has the good fortune to be advised and assisted by her son-in-law, Lord Shaftesbury, as vicar-generaL Exeter-hall, we can well understand, is now letabuznda et laudan1s. In a considerable degree, Bishops Viliers and Bickersteth owe their mitres, and Mr. Close his deanery, to the Shaftesbury influence. Anglican scholarship is indsnant that plucked and hal f-plucked UJniversity mnen ehould be so highly advanced. But Anglican scholarship is somewhat consoled by such appointments as those of the Scotchman Tait to ttec see of London, and of the Irishman
Trench to the deanery of Westminster. Hlaving so able and enlightened a eoadjutor, Lady Palmerston is not, of course, obliged to devote her whole time to spiritual matters. Her ' Saturdays' are, as everybody knows, a great political institution-we had almost said, a great constitutional resource. The battle of Waterloo, as the Iron Duke said, was won at Eton; and it is in Piccadilly that the Queen's Government is carried on. There the vrinkled front of the Prime Minister is smoothed, and Hayter's toil made light. The 'independent member' who once enters her Ladyship's reception-rooms leaves his independence behind. The doom of the Lotophazi is his. The easy vhrtue of a hustings Hampden capit3ates to a nod, and surrenders at discretion before a smile."

The Princess Lieven.
THE PBrN?CESB LIEN.
TO THE EDITOR OF THETIME;S.
Sir,-It would be presumptuous in'any man to take up the pen at the present time, and in this country, for the purpose of vindicating the part occasionally assumed by women of high social position, and of talents and energy equal to their position, in the conduct of political affairs. We live under a Sovereign who is at once the first lady and the first political personage of this realm, and, if examples are to be sought for, in society, of women who have successfully employed their tact, their influence, and their resources in the pursuit of more important objects than the frivolous amusements of fashion, such examples adorn the domestic circle of the Prime Minister and the homes of many British statesnen, whose 'wives play no inconsiderable or inglorious part in the political career of their family, and, I will add, in the service of their country. The late Princess Lieven'war sich a woman; and, as an attempt has been made to confound her in the sweeping censure bestowed on what are termed "the intrigue3 of female politicians," I trust I may be allowed to record in your columns some of the claims she undoubtedly possessed to a degree of respect and consideration which has not been shown tohermemory. Her politicaliniluence was exercised for no petty or personal objects; she played a part in the great game of politics because her position had placed it within her reach, and her tastes were gratified and excited by success until politics became the predominant interest of her life.
Married young to a man who scarcely deserved her affection or her respect, the business of active life and objects more serious than the ordinary pastimes of society became at first her diversion, at last her sole pursuit; and, although the direction and success of her efforts will be variously judged by those who approve and by those who condemn them, it is sturely an illiberal taunt against a woman of no common mark to accuse her of having lived for nearly half a century in intimate co-operation with the first statesmen of the age, and of having taken part in many of the principal events of the present century.
In 1812, when Napoleon crossed the Niemen, and the French campaign in Russia began, the Emperor Alexander lost no time in restoring the most amicable relations with this country; the alliance was renewed in London by Pozzo di Borgo, and ere long the Count and Countess Lieven arrived to fill the important embassyof Russia at the Court of the Regent. To establish, to secure, to perpetuate that alliance was the grand object to which their joint efforts were unceasingly and successfully directed, and the first result of it was the triumphant termination of the war, and the restoration of peace under the preponderating influence of Great Britain and of Russia. During the ensuing twenty years which that brilliant iembassy lasted the maintenance of this alliance was steadily adhered to, and, although more than twenty other eventful years have now elapsed since its termination, the desire of preserving or restoring friendly relations between Russia and Great Britain never ceased to be one of the favourite objects of Princess Lieven's life.'
The period of the Regency, during which Madame de Lieven was initiated into the habits of English society and the interests of English statesmen, was a period of dissolute morals at the Court and of high Tory principles in the Administration. She may not have escaped the influence of the one upon her connexions, or of the other on her opinions; but it is unjust to visit on the memory of a stranger the effecta of the changes which have taken place among ourselves between the Court of George IV. and the Court of Victoria-between the Ministry of Castlereagh and Liverpool and the Ministry of Lord Pahnerston. Madame de Lieven adopted the prevailing tastes of the English society of that day till they became her second nature, endeared to her by recollections far more attractive than those of her native country. Hence she acquired a position among us such as no other ambassadress from a foreign Court has since enjoyed-a position which these lines may still recall to the memory of some who can look back to those distant days when Catholic Emancipation was dtil under discussion and Reform still unborn. In questions of internal policy in this country Princess Lieven took no interest, except in as far as they affected the rise or fall of parties and persons in the State. But the extraordinary power she always exercised of drawing about her, by the exquisite refinement of her manners and the pungency of her conversation, the most vigorous intellects of the age, placed her on terms of equal advantage with all the Governments which passed successively through the tenure of office. To Mr. Canning, especially, she lent a cordial and not ineffectual support, more particularly in his difficult relations with theEing, and the only cloud which was ever known to interrupt the long and confidential intimacy of the Princess with the Duke of Welling. ton was raised by her avowed disapproval of thcse dissensions which proved so fatal to the permanent interests of the Tories. But on the change which occurred in 1830 Lord Grey was not less devoted to her society than his predecessors had been under very different circumstances, and the maintenance of peace at that critical moment was perhaps aided by the discreet and temperate counsels of the Russian Embassy.
It has been well said of Princess Lieven, that she had the clearness and virility of man's intellect with the tact of woman's-the grace of her sex without its frivolity, and the elegance of the highest breeding without its formality. These were the secrets of her influence, and I believe she had no others. Her knowledge of affairs was not profound, and her interests were always more keenly excited by persons than by things; but in the management of those personal relations which fill so large a part in human affairs she has never been surpassed. Nothing can be more absurd than the vulgar error that she was a mere tool of Russian ambition-an instrument for the promotion of schemers of fraud and rapine. On the contrary, throughout the long and constant correspondence which she kept up with the Imperial family, I venture to affirm that if ever her opinions see the light they will always be found on the side of moderation, of conciliation, and of peace. Her abhorrence of war, and especially of a war which divided England and Russia, was invariably expressed in the strongest terms; and though when her country fell under the merited chastisement of its ambition she generously sought to palliate the errors of the late Emperor, no one rejoiced more cordially than the Princess in the cessation of the late conflict, even at the price of a defeat.
It is not, however, for her supposed influence on politics in the present state of Europe, which may
e said to have almost entirely ceased, but as a link between the present and a past era of political and social life, that Princess Lieven might deserve a lers ungracious record than she has received in this country.
Little remains of the society of that brilliant period-still less, perhaps, of friendships to which she at least was not unfaithful. The present generation has other merits, other pursuits, and other defects; but her name will retain a place among the remarkable persons and the great events of the 19th century, not less entitled to celebrity, and more entitled to respect, than that of the Princesse des Ursins at the Court of Madrid.

DB. LIVINGSTON'S DISCOVEBIES.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-A letter from Dr. Livingston in 1%c Times oE Saturday, complaining of ax advertisement put out by Messs. Routledge and Co. requires some explanation.
During the last three weehs a NKartative of JJr. Livingston's Mi4sionary Jounmeys and Discovries in Centrad Souh Africa bas been ap rng in the columns of the *itsh Banner newspaper. This narrative has been compiled from authorized documents, and with it has been published aa illustrative map which Dr. Livingston saw whenit was submitted by the en,'raver. M1any applications having been made for the repulMication of this series of papers in apero manent form, an arrangement was effected with Messrs. Routledge and Co. to publish it as a sixpenny pamphlet of 64 pages. The advertisement announcing this work does not contain a refereno to the newspaper, and thus arises the mieapprehension. We have explained the matter to Dr. Livingston this morning, and the future advertisements will apfear In the altered form.
It is due to the :featmRoutedge to ate that no blame is attributable to them; they aimply undertook to publish the work, and we only regret that the doctor funistentionmllyi we ae sare), mnisquoted the advertisement in questlo.a

The Loss Of The Violet.
THE LOss OP TH VIOLzET.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TlMES.
Bir,-I perceive that repeated advertisements are being put forth in the news'papers soliciting subscriptions for the benefit of the widows and orphans of the cre w of the ill. fated Violet. I do not object to this; indeed, I so far approve of it that I have already sent my own contribution of 51. to be added to the list.
But I wish to remark that the Violet belonged to a very prosperous steampacket company, which conveys passengers across the Channel at high rates, and gives them marvellously little accomraodation in retarn for their passagemoney. The recent Exhibitions in London and in Paris, and the additional transit oocasioned by the Russianwar, have enormously augmented the dividends of the Dover Royal Mail Company. And this is the first serious accident which has occarred to any of their boats.
It occurs therefore to me that before the said company calls on the public to provide for these poor widows and orphans it ought to declare what it is proposed to do for the sufferers out of their own funds; and it ought to show that the provision required for the families of the late crew. of the Violet is of too great magnitude to be bome by the shareholders of the Dover Royal Mail Company, in whose service they perished.
I feel deeply for the widow and the orphans; but I feel as deeply-though very differently-for the shareholders of a company who have for years been conveying the public across the Channel in over-crowded boats, at enormous charges, penned together on deck like cattle in a railway track.

"DAVISON V. DUNCAN."-Now we are not going to
"DAvsSox v. DuNcAx."-Now we arrenotgoingto question the correctnees of this decision in point of law, and indeed it perfectly accords with what we have always understood to be the present law of libel, but we do most strongly dispute the policy of that law as applied to the publishers of newspapers. The journalst who of his own mere motion, and malicionsly, publishes libellous matter ought doubtless to suffer for it. Sach a mra abuses and prostitutes the power which he wields, and converts it into an ddious engine of oppression. Bnt the case of "Davison v. Duncan" is very different from this. It is merely the case of a journalist pubishing in his newspaper the proceedings of a nneeting which might, so far as appears, have been at. tended by ail England, if all England could have been squeezed into the room where it was held. In presenting the report to his readers, Mr. Duncan only did what they expected, and required at his hands, and what they would have severel reprobated him for not doing. How is th. journalst in such a case to reconcile his duty towards his readers with his duty as expounded by the sages of the law? Again, look at the monstrous hardship inflicted upon the publisher of a newspaper by requiring him to ascertain that every report of every meeting sit not contain a tittle of libellous matter. Why, in that case, the proprietor of every journal of frequent publication ought to retain counsel for the purpose of perusing and advising upon every report of a publc meeting before it is inserted in his newspaper, for it is by no means always easy to distinguish between fair, temperte criticism, and lbel One ac'.ion for libel, in which moderte damages only were recovered, might otherwvise sweep away a larg,e portion of the year's profits. Another very preposterous consequence might follow the present state of the law. There are some words which, when spoken at a public meeting, would not be sLander, but which would become libel as soon as they were transferred to the columns of a newspaper. Thus the original utterer, who no doubt entertained some feeling against the person with relation to whom they were spoken, would be liable to no penalty, but the journalist in whose paper they were innocently, and, perhaps, unknown to himself, reported, would find himseif Mable to an action for libel. We may be told, perhaps, that private character is of so much consequence that it ought to be protected at any cost. The fact, however, is that the reputation of merely private persons is rarely assailed in a publc meelig. It is usually some act done by a man in a quas public character, which exposes him to the withering scorn and unsparing denunciation of the platform orator, and such a man's reputation becomes public property, to be freely canvassed and criticized by his fellowcitizens. And even where this is not the case,-where the person attacked holds no public office and has never meddled in public life, it would seem that his appropriate remedy is not against the journalist who is the innocent cause of spreading his adversarys misstatements, but against his adversary himself. Damages recovered against the former will neither salve his wounded reputation nor gratify his spleen, for he has really no cause of quarrel with the innocent publisher. The most effectual redress which can be ailbrded him by the journalist is the publication of a denial or the charges brought against him, together w dith any nroof which he might be able to adduce of their falseness, which eould circulate as widely as the charges themselves; and, until such publication had been requested and refused, no action should be allowed to be brought. Unless the law as laid down in "Davison v. Doncan" be altered, the position of newspaper proprietor, publshers, editors, and reporters will be absolutely intolerable, while the public Will sustain a very considerable loes in not being allowved to receive accurate reports of proceedings in which they may feel deeply interested.-Leeds Mercury.

J. H. Eyde and Co., of the ODmuberland Ironwvorks, Bristol.
REPsENTr~rON OF COLOHESTER.-An addreas from Lord John Manners, annoancing his intended retirement from the representation of this borough, was issued late on Saturday evenring. ExpreSsdn deeD reg-ret at severlag a connexion which had eIsted or nearly seven years, he adds:-
" But it is impoesible for me oansistently with my sense of publii
obhgation and pivate duty to decline complyug with the request which has this day been made to me from the c mustituency hitherto represented bymy brother. I have therefore yielded to it and now propose to resign into your banad that whi^h I nuust high4 vaue-the representation of your ancient borough.L
The vacancy is likely to occasion a sharo contest. There are four candidates already in the field-Lviz., Mr. T. J. Miller, merchant of Milbank, for a short time &LP. for ?daldon, Conservative; Mr. J. GurdonlRebow, of Wivenhoepark, adjacent to the borough, who professes moderate Whig, principles, but is a Churchman; Mr. Hamilton, a barrister en the Home Circuit, Conservative; and Mr. Havens, a non-practising barrister, who i8 a freeman of the borough. and has for rome years taken a prominenet, thougah somewhat erratic, part in local politics-*generally professing ultraliberal principles, but on the fast occasion a supporter of Lord John Maners. The raced will lie between Mr. Miller and M1r. Rebow. as, although the Conservative interest is strong in the borough, the latter gentleman must be supposed, fromn his iznuediate connedion with the town, to possess a greater amount of local influence.
CRHTA AND NGLAN-D.-The trae cause of the invasion of China-for it is useless to mince words-appears to be this :-The reations between the EuroDeaus and the Chinese have reached the point where an 'amicable connexion is no longerpossible. One or the other must dominate, or China must be left to her isolation. The latter alternative is, we need not say, impossible. Even if the nations retired they would at. first give place only to bands of organized smugglers far more dangerous han themselves, and iathe end to lussia. For the Mongol to rule is equally impossible. Even if the submission of a civilized tD aU uncivilized race were not an unpardonable crime agaist mankind, the Mongol has not the means of ruling. Three hundred millions of humait beings caunot save their richest city from the gripe of 3,000. If those 3,000 choose to retain Canton, all the force of all the empire will not weigh an ounce in the scle of their determination. The remaining alternative has therefore been adopted. The Chinese have been taught uninistakeably that if China and Europe come into collison it is Chia awhich is to yield. The wise are to rule the foolish, under penalty, if necessary, of shells. If we are asked who is judge to decide between wise and foolish, we answer at once-the event. If there were not a judi. cial blindness in the race they could not be thus coerced. The Lave every advantage-wealth, numbers, ahipe, as muc of science as is necessary to kill. Yetthey ield to the civilization of a body not equal to the population of a lane in the conquered city. For no less an obect thanthis, however, can such a slaughter be fairly justiied. If Sir John Bowringr yields without securing permanent submission the whole of these lives will have been thrown away. To secure that submission he must raise his ideas to a lerel
ith the circumstanoes in which be is placed. The Calcutta zEngishnan states that he has applied to the Indian Goverment for troops. That was his natural course, but there re none to spare except at Madras, and the steam lines can even now hardly be maintained. He must fight his owt battle as Clive didbefore him. If he cannot nuster enougnh of military rabble in Singape, the Aclpelago, ad Hongkong to make efficient 2epoy regimeneu, te is nuegr4t to his position. -We believe that he wll no be found to failthat ie may, at lea-t for the preient, ritain Roesemaion of Canton, and niot improbably terninate ihe strf byfinally -introducingBriishbriue. The world willbethe tterfor thatnreatl anfd for the sonsequeneatoD which it mut in. vitably lead. Thte immes have eldom been m in ourabl. for i fmal dedlaion of the strfe.

London, Monday, February 2, 1857.
LONDON, 04ONDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 1857.
There is a peculiarity in the social life of England which signally distinguishes it from that of other Eiiropean coimtries. It has a variety of little circles, each a small world of itself, with its own language, tokens, and traditions. Into these a stranger can hardly penetrate; or, if he does, it is at the risk of being misunderstood and misrepresented. There are certain coteries where the ordinary subjects of light converse are the more metaphysical abstractions of doctrinal religion, where personal experiences and the gradations of faith supply the place of more mundane topics. There are others where the guest from withopt wil find himself as much abroad as GULLIVER among the Houhnymns, unless he is deep in the subjects of altars, credence-tables, and protheses; w here anthems and intoning are substitutes for operas and concerts, and where all human relations are regarded as subordinate to the value of " Presbyters." Again, there are others in which human progress, the promised extinction of pain and disease, if not of death, the communications of ungrammatical spirits, and the oscillations of intoxicated chairs and tables, are the sole topics of discourse. Each of these cliques speaks a language distinct from, and almost unintelligible to, its neighbours; and this language must be learned by every neophyte who seeks an introduction within the untried precincts.
A similar rule holds in political coteries. A foreigner, intelligent or otherwise, seated at a London dinner-table, may listen in turn to half-adozen men, who appear to possess an average amount of conversational fluency. There is nothirig peculiarly striking about them, unless it be the determination not to be peculiar. He is astonished when he is told that these quiet and agreeable men, who expressed no very strong opinions on any subject, and seemed to have a holy horror of enthusiasm, are the leaders of vehement and sectional opinions ; that the blandest of the guests excites provincial audiences by prophetic declamations against despotism all over the world, and that one of the most sensible periodically preaches an approaching millennium, when all Europe is to disband its armies and occupy itself with textile fabrics. So it is. Places and classes of men have their hobbies, social and political, as they have their manufactures ; and gentlemen having the happiness to belong to a party are expected to trot these hobbies out on the hustings or at the Mechanics' Institute for periodical recreation.
One of these gentlemen-AIr. MILKER GIBSONhas to get up a peculiar part for the edification of Manchester. This great city is as famous for the making of theories as of cotton goods. One theory which it has created, or at any rate developed to a remarkable extent, is what is called the " peace theory ;" and to this Mr. GIBsoN, as in duty bound, plays up at stated intervals. Like all "duty" performances, it is somewrhat overdone. But this very exaggeration pleases an audience which knows little relaxation from the prosaic routine of every day's rough work, save in the excitement of the political or the religious platform; and which, in its theology, its politics, and its music, loves strong pieces de I resistance; It would be dull work to ex-
amine, analyze, and discuss the principles of [State policy ; coolly, minutely, judicially to count,
compare, and deduct. But the flavour of a higher enJoyment follows the description of imagined wrongs and impossible remedies. Accordingly we have the old story over and over again, each time flavoured and spiced to the local taste. Our army is too large, too costly, too menacing; we are absorbing the strength of the nation'a eces in
demonstrati6n' which both alarm sind incense 'our neighbours; we are ineulcating the duty of military training and military organization when we ought to be disbanding and disarnimg; we have plenty of money wherewith to meet the emergencies of an unexpected war; but it is both foolish and wasteful to invest it in anticipative preparations for war; and a great deal more in this strain. It would be superfluous to point out how much of this is disingenuous and how much irrational. Of those who listened and applauded, the majority would be as little prepared to follow the assertions of the speaker to their legitimate and logical consequences as the audiences who cheer Mr. GouGv are to diet themselves upon tea and cold water. They know perfectly well-as Mr. M. GiBsoN himself knows -that our reduced army will be the smallest in Europe, in proportion to the magnitude, wealth, and exigencies of the empire. They and he know that Belgium, which is not one-tenth or onetwentieth the size of the British territory, that Naples and Piedmont (two of the smaller kingdoms of Europe), have each of them armies, proportionately speaking, much more numerous than ours. When ir. GIBSON tells them that 30,000 British soldiers lost their lives in the Crimea through the incapacity and ignorance of their chiefs, they will hardly fail to arrive at a deduction directly opposite to his proposition that practice and organized training are wholly unnecessary for the future safety and success of our troops. Nor, when he tells them that each British soldier in the campaign cost this country 841., while France only paid her soldiers 421. a-head, will they forget to dra-w their own inferences from the demonstrated difference between the fields of employment in England and in France respectively. WVhen he quotes Lord BnorGHAx and Lord WXLLzsLEY on the perils of standing armies, his Manchester followers might not be aware that both these authorities might be quoted with greater appositeness and in stronger terms for the maintenance of adequate national defences ; but they could not be ignorant-even if he were unconsciousthat the recent demonstration against Canton, which he condemns, was provoked, not by one act of unintentional offensiveness, but by years of studied insolence and annoyance ; and it must have been an impulse of irony that inspired a cheer when he had the intrepidity to denounce our military preparations as a standing menace to the tranquil Continent. MlIr. GIBSON cannot have been abroad of late, or he miglht have beard in every capital of Europe opinions most repugnant to his notion that foreign States entertain a dread of our military aggressiveness.
These statements, foolish and haphazard though they be, are the growth of a system. Certain people like to hear certain things, and go to hear them whatever be their value or truth. Manchester folks have heard the keynote of peace and disarmament touched by master hands, and like to linger on the sounds of a feebler imitation. But, though the teacbings of history may be despised and its facts distorted, there are limits beyond which it is dangerous to be disingenuous. Mr. GIBSON professes to believe that the country is going to wreck and ruin through the extent and costliness of its armaments. Mr. GIBSON complains of the wholesale folly that will not let England spin and forge in humble inoffensiveness for a purchasing and unaggressive world. But what has Mr. GIBSON himself done to prevent or control the evil of which he complains ? He makes speeches of some length and elaboration at Manchester. But Manchester is not the House of Commons, only a constituency of the House. What has he done in his place in Parliament ? The time and place for opposing an expensive mischief were in Committee on the Estimates. Why did he not then propose a reduction of military expenditure? He wil say that it would have been useless. But why did he not try? It is not exactlv fair in
him to sit by inactive while vast sums are voted for objects which he detests, and then to appeal to the NENxEsis of a reforni meeting at Manchester. Professions on the hustings and the platform are but a poor exchange for actual work in Parliament. But, if Mr. GIBSON was the unresisting witness of measures which he could not have hoped to resist successfully, he was also the passive conniver at the defeat of measures which he might have helped to carry successfully. It is all very well for him now to profess his readiness to assist the people of Manchester in their struggle against the fiscal uswupations of Liverpool, but why did he and the two or three who act with him remain mute and passive when theLocal Dues Bill was before, the House? Why, on a question which was of deeper moment to their constituents than the reduction of some 20,000 soldiers, did they content themselbe3 with a cold, if not a menacinsilence ? Mr. GIBSON says that he is ready to support the bill this session. Let him introduce such a bill himself. No Government is likely to repeat the experiment of last year, though if Mr. GIBsoN and his party had zealously supported it that bill would not have been withdrawn, and Manchester might now be free from an obnoxious impost.
On the whole, while it is not inmpleasing to hear the sturdy expressions of exceptional and sectional opinions, it is disappointing to hear them expressed only where they are safe from conflict and the chance of success. It is still more vexatious to see members of experience andl weight sacrificing to fond and impracticable crotchets subjects of pressing interest and lasting importance; and for this perversity Mr. GIBSON must be held especially responsible.

It is one glory of our social institutions that the
It is one glory of our social institutions that the Englishman is thereby prepared, not, indeed, always for self-government, but for every kind of government. There is no state of society, from a BouJBON despotism, with Inquisition and tortare, down to the rudest anarchy, of which we could not supply many examples, some on a considerable scale. The actual power resides sometimes in the owner of 30,000 acres, sometimes in the employer of a thousand artisans; sometimes in the wealthy incumbent, sometimes in the Boanerges of the rural Ebenezer. Here it is his Lordship's steward or a sturdy falnier who gives law to the rural population, there the village shopkeeper. In one parish a vestry divides once a-month on every possible question, in another a silent stream of usage has flowed time out of mind. These are the ordinary conditions of society; but there are also the extraordinary, in the shape of raging parties, obstinate authorities, desperate resistances, revolutions, interTegnums, suits of law, and paper controversies. There is every kind of result, as one principle or another gainis the day; and tvo neighbouring parishes or towns may settle down into the most amicable contradictions, bowing in each case to the behests of fate or the force of circumstances. Thus England prepares a man for every form of government, just as itE varying climate fits us for tropical suns and Arctic frosts, for dry and for damp, for Bengal or Hudson's Bay. The particular point selected for the formation of these political varieties is, of course, an important one, else it would not warm our Anglo-Saxon blood up to the proper heat. It is religion, and all that appertains to it. On the objects and the rule of faith, on spiritual systems and forms of worship, on ecclesiastical polity and the rights of conscience, we wage an internecine war in this country. There are, indeed, few among us who would not honestly avow a desire to extinguish.-every other system but their own,
and wo dco not to a considerable extent act on thit feeling. .The law, in its requirements, and not less in iti silence, offers great encouragement to this holy civil war. There is hardly a question of internals or of externals, from the nature and operations of the Dmry down to the proper mode of levying a church-rate, that is not in the courts of law, or, has not lately been, or may not soon be.
But the mode of raising funds for the maintenance of our churches and of public worship is perhaps the most hotly contested and the most variously decided, or left undecided, of all these questions. A recent decision has left the law in that transitionary, twilight state, which best promotes the development of social differences. The sovereignty of an old custom has received a deathblow, and now for several years, about the age of the rebellion in China, parish after parish has fallen into the hands of the foe. Though Parliament has done nothing to stop the social war, and has too much love of fair play to spoil such good sport, it shows its usual wish to know all about it. So we have before us a very bulky return, weighing rather less than two pounds, and purchaseable for 2s. 4d., containing an immense mass of slovenly answers to slovenly questions on this interesting subject. These questions have been addressed to every parish and district in England and Wales, and have elicited every variety of reply, from no reply at all, which is the case with many parishes, to a good deal of superfluous information from gentlemen ambitious of adding to the topographical literature of their country. The principal question asked is whether churchrates have been refused during the last 15 years, and ceased to be collected ? We are happy to say that we have not the least idea who framed this question, and therefore we shall not be suspected of a personal bearing when we observe that we have seldom seen an interrogatory that attempted so much and did solittle. It does not meet the very fiequent case of a parish in which no rate has been demanded for the period in question; and accordingly two parishes, one of which pays rates to this day, and the other of which never did from time inmmemorial, return the same answer,-" No." It does not meet the question of a rate assessed and partially paild; that is, paid by a half or a third of the parish, or in some other ambiguous state. Some of the answers attempt to volunteer information, but, as the majority do not, we can only deal with this document as a loose mass of information. As such it is sufficiently interesting, and shows the vast variety of local governments and influences under which it is possible for an Englishman to be brought up.
A few of these answers will serve as specimens, and even these we must abridge:-" Rate refused " sometimes, but still collected." " Refused this "year." "Not yet refused, but great difficulty " of collection." " No rate; land sufficient for " church repairs." " Not refused, but not col-
lected." " Rlate granted and collected in 1850; "but the hamlets refused to pay their quota,
so the town has done so too." " Not re"fused, but protested against by a Dissenting "minister." " Refused in the years 1844-5."
Granted again and again, and not refused, "but not collected." " Not refused, though the
majority of the large ratepayers are Dissenters." "The churchwarden occupies nearly the whole or "the parish ; so he and the clergyman have re"paired the church without a rate." " Last rato " collected in 1847; none asked for since." "Last "four years ago ; none wanted since." " None "refused ; ceased to be collected nine years ago."
Opposed in 1839 ; none attempted since." " Col"lected throughout the parish, though the distriet "churches are maintained by their own pew-rents." "Refused by two or three persons, but collected "from the rest." " Rate for a cemetery loan; " collected with difficulty." "Voluntary rate sub" stituted." " Refused in 1854, and still." " An " opposition now organized." " Refused in 1854;
subscriptions till 1855, and then a rate." " Re"fused by one person, who has been compelled to "pay." "Onlyonehouseintheparish. Churchlands " enough." " No church-rates, it being a district,
though the clergyman himself does pay a rate." " The district pays rates to the mother parish." "Tate not made, or likely to be made ; Dis-
senters too strong." " Refused by Dissenters; paid by Church people." " Refused last Easter." " None collected for three years." " None for " sixteen." " Rate not refused because the " glebe and tithes contribute; refused elsewhere " because they don't." " No rate refused, but " the last collected 24 years ago. Great opposi" tion; some in arrear, through the uncertainty of "the law." "No church-rate asked for within "the memory of man. Rate, when required, only " collected from persons rated at 10/. a-year." " Not asked for, owing to Dissent." " Rate for " church collected with difficulty; that for chapel "refused, 1854." " The Duke of BEDFORD gra"tuitously keeps the church in repair." " Re"fused 1853." "No rate attempted; voluntary " contributions; district church maintained by "C rate on pew-owners." " Refused 1855 ; a poll
inexpedient in the present state of the law." Refused; in the event of a voluntary rate, "not more than two-thirds would be collected." "Chapel the property of Lord DERBY, and main"tained by him and his tenants." " Rate of id. "in the pound laid in 1851, but could not be " collected." " Supported by the trustees of the " River Weaver Navigation." " A ' cirage' tax " sometimes demanded for the mother church, and
paid by a few who choose to do so ; the district "church maintained out of pew-rents." "Refused "1854, but since collected to pay a debt." "Rate "disallowed for certain items, which will have to "be paid by voluntary contributions." "No rates,
but supported out of corporate fund." "No rates, ".an annual rent-charge of 41. being provided "instead." " Rate of 3d. in the pound objected "to ; carried on a poll, but never collected." "Rate of 1Id. in .the pound in abeyance through " the unsettled state' of the law." " Refused
1856, andcmeetingadjournedctilllo5.'." "Com"promise of id. in the pound a-year, and sub" scriptions to make up the deficiency." " Re" fused in a few cases."
These answers are hastily taken from the first 18 pages out of 219, and they are from the counties of Beds, Berks, Bucks, Cambridge, Chester,
and Cornwall. As may be readily supposed, the metropolitan counties, Lancashire, Yorklshire, and some others, supply answers bearing more strongly on the singular position of church-rates and the growing resistance to them. Even from the above counties we have omitted many instances of refusal, and particularly several long stories that would each take a paragraph, and not leave a very clear impression on the mind of the non-legal reader. In the midst of the many cases of successful resistance, it is a matter of surprise ,that so many districts, having to keep up thdir own churches, shouild still pay rates to th,n mother church. Where justice is so plainly on the side of resistance it cannot be long deferred. From the above answers, and after a glance through the rest of the return, ve cannot help coming to the conclusion that henceforth the law will very seldom be invoked for the collection of a rate. It is quite obvious that any one case of successful resistance is sure to spread. Trhus5 in one parishl, no rate is collected because one rich man rehses to pay it, and the rest are not prepared to mea(jure their purses against his by an appeal to law.R They are then ashamed
to collect rates from auy poor mmn,so long as they let the rich man go. The samere4ult .nust follow from any case of ob4tinate refusal. Thus the whQle question is passing outb of the province of law; and in the place of the old church-rate there is rising up a number of local customs, according to the local circumstances. Such a result is very much in accordance with the genius of the British race. Many attempts at national uniformity, as, for example, in the kindred instance of tithes, have ended in the greatest variety of practice. Our parochial Bystem itself, professing uniformity, has led to the most startling and inconvenient anomalies, and at this time presents the greatest obstacle to a uniform system; indeed, to any system at all. People look very naturally to the Legislature to set these matters right, to,settle the question of rates, stop the parochial warfare, and provide some plan for the maintenance of churches. Some, indeed, look further, and expect the Legislature to subdivide parishes, and even redistribute the revenues of the church. It is often our fate to have to dismiss from our thoughts what a Legislature might do or ought to do, and consider only what it is likely to do. It is likely to do little or nothing in this case. They who have no particular affection for the Church of England find their work done for them without the interference of Parliament, and they will be only too happy to let things alone. The return before us shows parish after parish reconciling itself to the present state of the questiona large proportion has now done so; and, without [the interference of the Legislature, it is probable
that in twenity years church-rates will be a matter of history.

The King of NAPLES has felt it necessary to
The King of NArixs has felt it necessary to make some concession to public opinion in the rnatter of the political prisoners who now languish in the dungeons of his kingdom. The gloomy doors are to be thrown open, the gaunt figures are to issue forth, and the land is to be cleansed from the stain of cruelty. A convention has been concluded between the Government of the Two Sicilies and the Argentine Confederation for the transfer of a certain number of these unfortunates to the shores of South America as colonists. Whether all wil receive this modified pardon, or whether only those considered the less guilty or the less formidable wil
be permitted to expatriate themselves, is as yet unknown, but it seems that the Knio is at length wiling to relieve his overcrowded prisons, and to deprecate the censure which falls on him even from his despotic brethren. The convention is said to stipulate for the despatch and reception of successive companies of prisoners, whom the Sicilian Govermnent shall send at its own cost to South America, and whom the Argentine Confederation shall locate in suitable spots on the Parana and Uruguay. Each colonist is to be allowed a certain extent of land and sufficient stock for the commencement of an agricultural experiment. Certain immunities from taxation for a term of years are to ke granted them, and the Confederation will do its best for their progress and prosperity. Such are the stipulations by which the King of NAPLxs designs to provide for those ts whom he will give liberty on the hard condition of quitting their native country and fixing themselves in a wilderness of the southern hemisphere.
It must be evident to every one that the concession we announce is neither large nor gracious. King FEDtINAND is not a man to pardon, and the state of his kingdom is such that an amnesty u ould probably be dangerous to his power. But even the more merciful commutation of the sentences to banishment he equally rejects. POERIO and his fellows eannot be allowed to inhabit London or New York. They cannot be allo-wed to associate with the Liberals of foreign countries, to speak and write about Italy, to communicate with their friends at home, or give their experience of Neapolitan dungeons to the world at large. If they would see the light of day and shake the chains from their anl;les, it must be by accepting in e:xchange for a cel in Europe a prison more spacious but almost equally secure in a distant region of the world. On the banks of an American river they may indeed create a little Italy for themselves, and in time put in action those schemes of self-government which they have endeavoured to introduce inlto their former country. Or they may amalgamate with the kindred race to whose terTitory they have come, and forget the old world and aU its struggles. To many, indeed to the majority, the change wil no doubt be welcome. What capacity these modern Italians have for colonization has yet to be proved, but with the help of the Argentine Government it is likely that they wil meet with sufficient success to make their lot supportable, if not happy. To the chief men, however,-those who are distinguished by energy, patriotism, or ambition,such exile will be, perhaps, little preferable to the confinement of a prison. We know not how far the released prisoners will be bound to remain in the colony, but it is proIable that some condition wil be imposed on them which will secure the KINi- against their return to Europe. On the whole, therefore, they will have little to be thankful for, except the deliverance from actual chains, foul air, and darkness.
Yet we cannot but feel a species of satisfaction at this proof that even a monarchl like the
uillg of NfAPLES is not able long to remain uminfluenced by the opinion of the world. Ve may be fully sure that even so smaU a concession to humanity as this was wrung with difficulty from a ruler accustomed all his life to deal with his subjects as if he owed no account to GOD or man. The act, narrow and ungracious as it is, gives hope of a better future. As to the prisoners themselves, we wish them success in their new home; all that are strong and healthy among them may find on the baniks of the Parana the competence which so many thousands of the English race have found in similar rcgions. It may be distasteful indeed to exchange civilization for the hard life of a dweller in the desert, but the unfelled forest and the untilled plain with freedom are preferable to beautiful cities and smiling landscapes under such a rule as Naples has borne for many a year.

The Turner Water-Colours.-On Saturday
TnE TURI-E;R NVArTE-coLotOs.-On Saturday 100 water-colour drawings of this great artist were privately exhibited at klarlborough-house. They consist chiefly of the drawings from the famous Liber Studioruni, in which the medium emDloyed is sepia or Vandyke brown; of the well-known series of drawinjgs called " English Rivers;" of those which illustrate the course of the Seine; and of the exquisite drawings for the vignettes to Rogers's ]ialy. These, with the great landscapes of Edinburgh painted in the year 1800, the " Capture of Fort Bard" in 1805, "Ivy-bridge," also an early drawing, and "Folkestone," will be found to exhaust the number specified. Theas drawings, which have been mounted and hung by Mr. Wornum with great taste and judgmnent, may be seen by the public from this day, and wre feel sure that our readers will rejoice when they hear that these magnificent works can, vith few exceptions, really be seen. All lovers of art, while they recognize the glory to which water-colour painting attained in Englaud under Turner, will appreciaste the munificence which bequeathed such treasures to a nation which hitherto has done nothing in raturn but violate the only conditien which the testator attached ta his bequest, when he stipulated that his pictures slould be exhibited to the public in a separate building.

LIVERPOOL, FZl. L
The linited States mail steamship Ericsson has arrived with advices from New York to the 17th ult., but has not brouOght any specie. On the 18th the Ericsson experienced a most terrific gale from the north to the north-east, and the cold was so intense as to completely cover the ship with ice, large quantities of which formed about the deck.
The screw steamer Emeu, from Eavre, arrived at New York on the 15th, and the screw steamship City of Washington on the 17th ult.
The proceedings in Congress had been of almost exclusively local interest. In the Senate Mr. Pugh (Democrat), of Ohio, had given notice of a resolution requesting the Secretary of the Treasury to inform the Senate what would be the annual income of the Government, according to such estimates as he might be able to make, if one-fifth of the duties on such imported articles authorized by the Tarif Act of July, 1840, should be remitted; what if onefourth should be remitted; and what if one-third should be remitted. The resolution was adopted.
The Pennsylvanian Legislature had presented a resolution instructing their Senators to vote for the admission of Kansas as a free State.
The river and harbour of New York continued to be filled with ice, causing considerable damagdN!-to vessels, and rendering the navigation hazardous. A bark had been cut through by the ice and sunk.
At Albion, New York, a riot was going on in the main street between a party of Americans and a party of Irish; knives and other weaDons were being freely used- The Irish party were labourers on the canal, and vho, having received their wages, had got drunk. Two of them had been killed, and four Americans were so much inj ured that they -were not expected to recover.
By the steamship Texas, at New Orleans, from San Juan, Nicaragua, later advices had been received at New York, vii telegraph, to the following effect:-
It was reported that the Costa Ricans, protected by the English fleet, had seized every steamboat on the San Juan river.
Colonel Lockridge, with 250 men, had possession of Punta Arenas; but the Costa Rican force, of 1,000 men, held every other point on the river.
It is confirmed that General Henningsen had beaten the allies at Granada, and joined Walker at Rivas.
Walker's army is reported to have been in good spirits and confident of success, while the allies were fighting among- themselves.
The steamship San Carlos left Virgin Bay with passengers on the 3d of January, but was captured by the Costa Ricans soon after she got into the river.
The steamship James Algar, with the passengers which she took from the Tennessee at Norfolk, arrived at San Juan on1 the 9th ult., but in consequence of the dif9iculties on the Transit route she sailed next morning for Aspinwall to for-ward her passengers by the Panama route.
The New York money-market was a little easier, and rates had a downward tendency, caused by a slight " let-up" in the drain of specie to the South, consequent upon the increased movement of cotton there, superinduced by a concession in prices, and a decreased demand for nmoney at New York through the temporary inactivity of general trade. The rates were 8 to 9 per cent. for prime 60 days to three months paper, 9 to 10 per cent. for four to six months ditto, and 7 per cent. on call. In exchange but little doing, and prices unsettled; quotations nominal at 1081 to 10S5 on London; 5f. 22c. to 5f. 21ic. on Paris
andI 36l t36o on Hlamburg. In cotton a fair business had been done at a reduction of ic. to ic. in consequence of continued heavy receipts and decline in prices at the Gulf Ports.
The markets closed steadily, flour firm and unchanged, purchases being only to the trade. For export there was some demand, but the ice restricted business. Cormmon superfine State, $6 25c. to S6 30c. Canadian superfine and extra, $6 50c. to $7 ,Oc. The stocks of grain being stored in the docks, transactions had been small, but the market closed strongly at full prices. Corn advanced 1c. to 2e. Oats firm. Pork advanced 12i cents on mess, and 25 cents on prime, with light receipts. Beef firm; prime mess inactive, nominally at 20c. to 25c. Cut meats in brisk demand, at 9je. to 10ic. for common to prime hams, and 72c. to 8c. for shoulders. Bacon active and the turn higher. Large sales of turpentine at 4$. Spirits held firmly at 53c. cash. Common resin a shade higher. Iron firm, with an upward tendency, Scotch pig, $30 oOc. ; English refined, $62 5Oc.; Russian sheet, at Boston, 131, six months.

CuRisfs HosP_TA.-It will be gratifying to the lovers of their old school to know that she is stil1 vindicating her position and earning fresh laurels at Cambridge. The fourth and eighth wranglers in the class-list just issuedviz., Mr. Claude H. Parez and Mr. Henry Ludlowv, were "Blues."
" BiG BEN " OF 'W SrTMLNsTER.-On Saturday afternoon the deep sonorous sounds of "Big Ben's" voice were heard for several hours booming over London. What was the cause of this continued clangour from the belfry of Westminster remained for some time a mystery. Some persona conceived that "Big Ben" was opening his brazen throat to announce the submission of Persia or the annexation of China; others, that the suecession to the throne of England had been rendered still mnore secure to the HIouse of HIanover; some Persons said that the great bell was rung because " the linge of the hitch" respecting the reconstruction of the Cabinet had been finally disposed of; nd others surmised that the bell was merely summoning the members to the Parliament
-ch is to commennnce its sittings ox Tnesday next. It was, however, no event of such interest as any of thes which caused 'Big Ben" to exert himself with so niuch energy and vigour, the cause of his giving tongue being simply a visit from M. E. B. Denison, Q_C., accoon
I anied by a band of bell-ringers. We may add that the four-quarter bells are on the eve of being cast; that " Big Een" will shortly be raised to his elevated position by the lelp of the hydraulic ram; and that the clock, in the adjustment of which some minor alterations have become necessary owing to the unexpected weight of - Big Ben," will be placed in the tower as speedily as possible. in this instance, as in so many others, the public will find that the authorities began at the wrong end. They were advised to cast the bells first, and then to make the clock. Instead of doing this they made the clock first, and then cast the lells. The result is, that the machinery of the clock is
,either heavy nor strong enough for the bells, and must be altered. Readers desirous of any further explanation will some day find it in the estimates.
THE BMtK or FAxeC.-The annual general n eeting of the shareholders of the Bank of France took place the day before yesterday, Count d'Argout, the Governor, in the the chair. The proceedings commenced by the chairman reading a report on the general operations of the establishRment during the year 18515. The censors then declaredthat, in conformity with the statutes, they had examined the accounts, and found them perfectly regular. A shareholder inquired if it was true, as ramoured, that the Bank of France was about to increaseitscapital? Count d'Argout replied that the board had not comne to any decision on the point, and that it appeared to him neither useful nor opportune to discuts the question. Anotber shareholder observed that the subject had been canvassed in the public journala only in the interest of the sbareholders themselves, as their pritege would expire in 186$, and it was advantageous to hav'e the privilege extended. A third shareholder observed that an inrease of capital, if it were to take place, would be for
lany shareholders who wera not engaged in business a beavy charge, and that it would be proper in that case to give facilities for the payment. To this it was replied *at if the increase of the capital of the bank should take place, the shareholders would have every desirable facility for the payment of their instalments. The meeting then proceeded to elect a regen.t for two years in the room of iL Jacques Lefebvre, deceased, when the sol of that gentleman-was chosen. 1. Darblay, censor; 3MM Lemercier de NerviUe and Fontenellat, receivers-general; and XL SansonDavillier. regent, whose term el office had expired, were re-elected.

Iutelligence from Jamaica extends to the 11th inst. The Legislature was not in session, and the mew Governor was anxiously looked for, as many important measures were left undecided owino to Uis absence. The island was generally tranquil'
De Cordora's lereantile Intelligenecr of the 10th 'contains its annual review of the state of the Jamaica markets, which says:-
"The year which has just been brought to a closs has leen principaily remarkable for the frequent fluctuations in -the affairs of commerce, and we regret that we cannot -congratulate our merchants upon any improvement in busi. mess during 18.-G6. . . . . Taking a retzospective view of 1856 we see little on which to comment, except circum.stances of depression in conjirercial circles. It would be thard to point to any one year in which the efforts of the merchant have bcen so unsuccessful as in the year just ended. Never, perhaps, has trade so terribly suffered, or conmmerce received so many shocks."
The importation of all descript:ons of provis:ons -during the year is said to have been immense, so that large supplies were always on hand, and the price of certain articles fell so low in 'consequence that importers had seldom been barely remunerated. Stocks on hand at the 'end of the year continued large, and lowprices must therefore rule for sowe tihe, until the stocks gradually decreased. Sugar cultivation had been carried on without positive loss, and the prospects -of the planters for the present year were, on the whole, considered to be very cheering. At the latest auction sales sugar averaged 22s. to 24s. per 10(01b. Sales of Irish butter had been made at 14d., and Halifax and American dull at Ild. Coffeb was iheld at 40s. to 42s. Corn was very dull, and in tour sales were confined to small parcels for imme-diate consumiption; 37s. to 38s. demanded by 3holders. Stock of pork immense, and no sales. Very little pimento at market. Exchanges on Lon-don were quoted, for Jamaica and Colonial Banks, 'DO days' sight, W per cent. premilm ; 60 days, 1 per cent. premium; 30 days, II per cent. premium; private bills, par. Merchants' bills on New York, 1i per cent. premium.
At Demerara nothing but mails were received, in consequence of an outbreak of cholera there. It -was supposed that the disease was imported in the Venelia, a cattle schooner from the (Orinoco. The first person attacked was a seaman on board the ship Parker, who was removed to the hospital and died. This was followed by another case, on board the ship Johnstone, where a promising young seaman was seized with the diease, removed to the hospital, and died in a few hours. After this a few -other cases occurred in ditrerent parts of the city, but its spread had been by no means rapid up to -the date of the mails leaving. The Boyal Gazette of the 8th says that the mortality of the city during the previous fortnight had not exceeded that of the -corresponding period of last year. Every precauMtion had been taken by the Executive which was deemed uecessary to arrest the progress of the disease. The exports of merchandise during the fortuight ending on the 8th inst. had amounted tosugar, 2,092 hhds., 90 tierces, 683 barrels, 303 half-barrels, 491 bags; rum, 1,170 puns., 155 hhds., 54 barrels; molasses, 122 puns., 115 casks. -Of these 717 hhds., 34 tierces, 405 barrels, 303 halfbarrels of sugar; 129 puns., 1 hlid. of ruLm; and -80 puns., 115 casks of molasses were shipped for the North American market. Timber, 271 pieces; shingles, 20,000; hides, 231; corn-neal, 30 barrels; -crackers, 30 half-barrels ; bread, 50 barrels; old iron, 10 barrels. Freights bad an upward tendency, and all the vessels in the river were either loading -or chartered.
From Barbadoes we lea;n that the House of Assembly met on the 30th ult., 20 members being ,present, and, after transacting a few items of business, adjourned for a fortnight.
WV, e have Trinidad advices to the 5th inst. The -weather during the previous fortnight had undergoen repeated changes, scarcely a day passing -wiLhout rain, more or less. On accoaint of tbe increased demand for sugar in the European and the North Aimerican markets the planters had been encouraged to commence sugar-making at an earlier period than usual, and some of the estates were already grinding. The Council of Governmeat had -an extra meeting on the 27th ult., when a far ourable statement of the financial position of the colony was laid before the members. The stock of breadstnffs -and other provisions from America was large, and -quotationis were merely nominal ; sales were effected -with difficulty, the retail dealers being only inclined to purchase small lots at a time from first hands.
There is no news of importauce from Grenada. Everything was quiet. It was rumoured that his Excellency the Governor-in-Chief intended visiting the island about the tin e of the meeting of the
Legiilatutre, wblca was adjeutrned to the 27th inst. 'The health of the island continued good, and the weather fine and seasonable. The canes had profited -wonderfully from the change in the weather, and the crop was expected to far exceed anything that -could have been looked forward to as possible some -three or four months ago. Some sugar had been made, but it would be several weeks yet before the mills were fairly set about. Cocoa planters were hardly able to reap, sweat, and dry their produce -with sufficient rapidity to meet the demands of the local market. Large shipments were made by each -succeeding mail steamer, and the entire crops of -some estaterl. had been forestalled by the mer-chants. "
At Carriacoui the season had on the whole been unfavourable, and the crops would be short. In some parts the cotton looked well, but this was not generally the case, and the same might be said of the provigion crop. The island was healthy.
Crros-Morne, one of the largest and most important towns of Martinique, was on Christmas-eve 'visited by a fire which in a short time laid it in ruius. The journals represent the amount of loss as emormous. Entire families have been totally ruined,-houses, shops, establishments of provisions and dry goods, all swept away. " Grx-Morne pre-
sents now the aspect of a vast encampment. A population desolated, aoject, wandering amid ruins and fragments reduced to charcoal, the only thelter to the inhabitants being the few houses left standing. Those families that have succeeded in saving a morsel of bread share it with those who have none. What universal despair ! what ruin ! what general misery !" As to the origin of the fire the Outre-AIer says
* 'It appears that some matches deposited in a garret had been imprudently lighted by a child, and the fire communi. cated to a bundle of foul linen, whence it swept on beyond control."
The intelligence from Mexico is of importance. General Parrodi had taken the supreme command of the army operating against the insurgents of San Luis Potosi, headed by Calvo. Advices had also been received that Vidaurri was on his way to San Luis, at the head of 1,800 men from the frontier, well armed and equipped, in order to attack the military rebels. Vidaurri had, accordirg to an agreement, dated the 18th of November, transferred the general conmnand of Nuevo-Leon to his successor on the 13th inst. According to the latest news received beforethe departure of the steamer the insurgents, on hearing that large forces were directed against them, had left tle city of San Luis and taken refuge In the Sierra. General Moreno had left Puebla, with the rest of his division, to attack Osallos. Thus an end would have been put to the pronunciamiento in the Republic and the revolutionary elements which worked against the President. General Jose Maria Yanez had arrived in Mazatlan, and been most cordially received by the people. He issued a proclamat on to all the troops under his command, and was to start for Sonora towards the end of December.
Mr. Barron, Her Britannic .Majesty's Consul, was received on his entrance into Tepic with imrnmense enthusiasm. i{e was accompanied by his numerous friends in carriages, and more than 500 mounted cavalleros left to receive him at the distance of eight leagues. More than 5,000 persons waited for him at his residence. Dturing the night a serenade was given, private houses and public places were illuminated, and guns and rockets fired in every street. A grand ball, given by Don Jose de la Mora, the chief person of the place, in honour of his return, finished the festivities of the day of joy for all classes of the inhabitants. The fair of San Jaan de los Lagos had, on account of the disturbances in the interior and the north, not been satisfactory to the merchants there. Buyers from the north and northeasb came in small numbers, and their purchases were rather linmited.
The constructionof the railwayfrom Guatzacaolcos to Tehuartepec had again been taken up by a mercantile firm of New York, and would be pushed on for speedy completion. The worlks on the railroad from the city of Mexico to Guadaloupe-villa had been taken up by Don Antonio Escaudon with great activity, and it was expected that towards the end of October the line would be opened. Another new rail way was also in the way of construction from the city of Mexico to Tacubaya, starting from the street Las Escalerillas, and paSSing close by the statue of Charles the Fourth.
Yr. Plumb, the agent for the New American Pacific Iron and Coal Mining and Land Company, and his scientific party, had arrived at Mexico, to proceed to their explorations.
From Central America we hear that WValker was in a desperate condition, and it was fully believed would not be able to hold out much longer. He had been beaten on several occasions of late, and the Costa Ricans had seized the river boats runnin from Greytown to the Lake Nicaragua, and stopped the communication between that place and Walker's forces. Au American steamer had, a feNv days Drevious to the sailing of the Clyde, arrived at Greytown, with about 150 men and a quantity of provisions for Walker's assistance. They were, however, still remaining at Greytown, having no boats in which to ascend the river.
SHIPPING INTELLIGENCE.

During the passage she encountered srvere weather, and extensive damnage was done to the vessel and cargo. At one time this steamer was in imminent peril of being lost. Three sailors were lost daring the gale, and a pass.enger (a Spaniard) was so alarmed at the danger of being drowned that he shot himself. The vessel was very much disabled by the stor,n, and her captain would not leave Vera Cruz and go in her agaiu to sea.
It is now ascertained that of the 89 persons who were on board the Mexican war steamer Iturbide at the time of her loss on the reel in the harbour of Vera Cruz only 17 were saved. None of the officers, engineers, purser, and master were able to esospe in that terrible catastrophe.

Extraordinary Flights Of Larks.-A Corre-
EXTRAORDINAR'; FLIGHTS OF LARXS.-A Correspondent sends us the following:-" I have just returned froimi a stroll in the Re%ent's Park (1 o'clock pan.. Saturday), where I witnessed a very unusual spectacle. When about 100 yards frorn the railing of the late Mr. Holford's ground I was brought to a stand by observing an inimense flight of larks coming over the Zoological-gardens, and making for tbe late Marquis of Hertford's. Their numberswere countlees, and they literaUy darkened the air; they were flying very low, and were obliged to divide in order to pass me on either side. Tbis flight took two or three minutes to go over, and, after a brief interval, was succeeded by another alrost as numerous. Being curious to observe whether it would be continued I remained walking up and down, and w as presertly gratified by observing another approach from the aame quaster, and passing over precisely the same line of ground. X stayed on the spot for upwards of an hour, during which time flight aiter flight passed over me, sometmnes in detachments of a few hundreds, at others in myriads. in one instance one of these flights settled almost within pistol shot of me and covered the ground, within a few inches of each other, for about the apace of half an acre. The unusual sight attracted the notice of one of the park-keepers, and of several persons who were passin, and who all declared they had never witnessed anything like it before; indeed, it might well be an object of astonishment unto the wide, upturned, wondering eyes of cockneys, for although 1 have for the last 20 years been accustomed to be abroad in the severest seasons, and not an unmindful jobserver, Inaver-savv such large and such continuous flights *of these birds. lIov long they may have been passing over h 'eforeIl came I ot course cannot say ; I only know that wheu I left, after being detained upwards of an hour by the phernosenon, ' the cry wras still they come,'"n

From Adelaide we learn that Dr. Baruh is said to have discovered anthracite coal on the lands of the South Austra3ilan Company.
The Geelong papers bring us news of the death of Mr. John Armstrong, at his residence in Grant county, on the 17th of October; while from Adelaide we bear of the death of two colonial celebrities-Captain WVilliam Allen and Mr. George Stevenson, Justice of the Peace and Coroner of the city. Captain Allen died suddenly, of enlargement of the heart, on the night of the lth of October, and his funeral was very numerously attended. Mr. Stevenson, who had had a long and severe illness, died on the morning of Sunday, October the 19th. Mr. Stevenson was in his 58th year, and would, if he bad lived two months longer, have been a South Australian colonist of 20 years' standing. He arrived out :rom England in Her Majesty's ship Buffalo, as private secretary to Captain Hindmarsh, the first Governor of the colony, and was the first clerk to the Legislative Council, the first coroner, and one of the first bench of magistrates. Before leaving England he had been an extensive con. tributor to the leading columns of the Gl.obe newspaper, and was devoted to other literary pursuits, He was editor and parb proprietor of the first newspaper in the colony, the South Austrauian Gazette and ColoniaZ Register (now the SmOk AusCtraiana Register), and was consequently " the Father of the South Australian press." Latterly he had only occasionally contributed to the press, and devoted his attention more exclusively to horticultural pursuits. The namne of George Stevenson (says the Adelaide Times) " was a household word in all parts of the colony, and the colonists will universally pronounce that he deserves to be eriolled among its earliest, its most attached, and its most assiduous and persevering benefactors."

From Chili we learn that the Republic is still progressing favourably. The President had removed, with his family, from Santiago to Valparaiso, where be was busily engaged in inspecting the publio improvements. The railroad bridges over the Cucharas were finished, and the trains now run from Valparaiso to Limache. The line would probably soon be extended from Tabou to Santiago. A floating dock, capable of admitting ships of 800 tons, had been erected by a private company in the harbour of Valparaiso. Two quays were about being constructed at Coquimbo.
The impoetant Consular convention between Chili and the United States (says the .Pa7zama Star and Herald) bas been finally settled and signed by Mr. Starkweather, .United States' Minister, and Don Silvestre Ocha3eaira, on behalf of the Chilian Government.
Twvo Ministers from Costa Rica were expected in Chili, their mission being to organize with Chili and Peru to jointly oppose filibustering invasions.
The United States' sloop of war John Adams arnived at Valparaiso on the 10th of December from Papeete in 40 days, and was awaiting orders. Her commander (Boutweil) was dangerously ill, and had been ordered home.
The advices from the mining distriots were favourable. The harvest, which was at hand, promised to yield abundantly. The Valparaiso markets were dull and fully stocked with staple goods. Few buyers had appeared, and the Bolivian trade seemed to have been all drawn to Arica this season. There had been large arrivals from Europe during the fortnight. During November 67,405 quintais saltpetre had been shipped from Iquique as follows:-

The River Plate provinces were enjoying peace, at length. Buenos Ayres was advancing in prosperity. The Indians had retreated from the frontiers.
From Pera we learn that the revolution had becom3 general throughout the Republic, and General Vivanco, the leader of the revolutionary party, had succeeded in obtaining possession of nearly every port on the coast, excepting Callao. The Lima journal El Comercio is filled with communications respecting the movements of the opposite parties, but we can glean little or no definite information from its columns. There appeared, however, lttle or no doubt of Castilla's overthrow, if the revolutionary party remained firm. Considerable excitement had been created by a proposition to purchase the Chinchas Islands, which was, of course, strongly opposed by the present agents,
lessrs. Gibbs and Co., on the ground that they hold them in trust to satisfy certain foreign debts.
General Vivanco has issued a proclamation, as Supreme Chief of Peru, in which he annuls the decree of President Castilla issued after the battle of La Palma, suspending the payment of interest accruing on the national debt. He says that such an attempt at repudiation is a death-stroke at the credit of Peru, and maintains that the proceeds of the guano islands must go, as originally agreed, to pay the debts due to iEngland and France, and others, whether internal or external, and that if the guano products are not srficient ior this purpose the Government must take every necessary means to facilitate the speedy cancelling thereof.

MR. QHABLRS MATHEWS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-A few days ago you kindly congratulated me on my recovery from my late accident, and complimented me on the fortitude with which I endured four dangerous operations; but you were proba'bly not aware, nor indeed was I myself, that I had undergone a fifth, and that, sometimes, of a much more fatal tendency than the others,-I have been married! A paragraph has "gone the rounds," as it is called, copied, I believe, from aGlocesterpaper, headed "Marriage of Mr. Charles Mathews," stating that I had "taken unto myself a second wife in the person of pretty Miss Oliver." Allow me, in justice to that amiable young lady, to announce publicly that such is not the case, in order that her numerous admirers may be assured that, as far as I know, she is still open to competition. I am grateful for the credit given me, at all events, for the good taste of my selection, though I must express my wonder at so improbable a story having obtained belief. In the first place, I cannot conceive that any one could have the heart to give her away, and in the next, having only my left arm at liberty at present, wbich I am sure would not be sufficient to encompass half her charms, and my right band being nearly disabled altogether. I could but at best offer her a left-handed marriage, and far ba it from me to insult her with such a proposition. No. Sir,-may sbe speedily obtain a husband of half my age and double my worth, andI shall be moat happy, with the appropriate tears of affection in my eyes, to give my consent and bless her union.
I am. Sir. Tour obedient servant.

The Bishop Of London And Mr. Gladstone On Church Extension.
THE BISEOP OF LONDON-AID MB. GLAD-
. STONE ON CHURCH BXTZNSION.
On Saturday afternoon a school-church for the labouring poor, situate in Essex-street, St. Peters, Stepney, was opened by the Bishop of London. Among the company present were the Right Hon.-Mr. Gladstone, MP., the Rev. Canon Champneys, the Dean of Westminster, the Rev. Dr. fessey, Master of the Merchant Taylors' School ; the Rev. F. D. Maurice, of Lincoln's-inn; the Rev. D. R. Loring, the Rev. E. E. RowseUl, the Rev. T. J. Rowsdl, incumbent.of the district; the Rev. Mr. Barry, the Rev. T. Stephenson, Mr. W. Cotton, late Governor of the Bank of England ; Mr. A. Head, Mr. Gassiot, Mfr. S. Charington, MIr. W. Baker, coroner, &c.
The district of St. Peter's, Stepney, is situated between Stepney proper and Alile-end NTewtown. It includes a considerable area, covered with some of the humblest dwelling% of the labouring classes at the east-end of London. The population of the enormous parish of Stepney is 80,000, and the district in which the church-school has been built contains a population of 13,000, for whom there was previously no church accommodation. The church of St. Peter's has an endowment of only 121. per anuem, and in consequence of the poverty of the popu. lation the local clergy have experienced great difficulty in establishing schools for the education of the children of the dock labourers, a vast number of whom reside in this locality. 'The school-church in Essex-street has been erected through the exertions of the Rev. T. J. Rowsell, incumbent of St. Peter's, Stepney. The plan proposed to be carried out is somewhat novel. The school-church is a plain, comfortable building, erected for the accommodation of about 300 persons. On Sundays short services are performed, adapted to the wants of the particular classes for wlhose benefit the buildin- is designed. During the week about 300 children of both sexes are instructed. It is also intended to deliver lectures, and to provide tea for the parents of the children, with the view of inducing in the lahouring poor the habit of attending relig5ous worship. The principal manufacturers in the neighbourhood have subscribed to erect the school, and Miss Burdett Coutts has liberally contributed towards the expenses of the scheme.
The Bishop of LONDON on taking the chair said that he had been requested by the Rev. Mr. Rowsell to attend that day for the purpose of opening the schooL There were sorne peculiar circumstances connected with the school which called for observation. It was not an ordinary school, because (as he was informed) it was to be used for various plurposes. On Sundavs it was to be n.ee -l e nla
ot worship; on weekdays it was to be a school and a place fo: social meetings, by which the incumbent and the other local clergy hoped to be brought into more intimate con. nexion with the poorer part of their parishioners. The peculiar uses to which the building was to be applied wculd perhaps call for a few observations from the bis'iop of the diocess, because it seemed to be somewhat of a departure from the ordinary principles of the church to vvhich they belonged. But he felt that the truth had grown up, and was growing every day, that with the mass of population which we had around us we must endeavour to call people together for worship however and wherever we can get them. Every one who had any experience of a larze narish
anew rue auncuiry or snoucmg tile very poor to frequent the parish church. The public had been too apt to con. sider those difficulties imaginary, and to suppose, what was true enough in its way, but hardly, perhaps, applicable in this case, that where the will existed a way was always to be found. This was true as regarded many of the poor, but it was also true that there were peculiar difficulties with regard to them which the upper classes did not themselves suffer, and which they were apt to make light of. They could take their places in any part of the church, and no one looked at their dress, and yet with regard to their poorer neighbours they were incined to say that God was no respecter of persons, and that the poor might worship Him in rags as well as in rich clothes. But those who knew the feelings of the poor-and their feelings were as sacred as those of the rich-knew that there were real difficulties in this matter of dress. Another difficulty with the poor was that when they came into the church they did not know where to place themselves. They felt that they might be occupying the seats of the wealthier classes to which they had no title, and this and other considerations often kept them away from places of divine worship. It was necessary to overcome their difficulties by opening up places of worship in which such difficulties would dis. appear, and by such means to lead the labouring classes to consider themselves more one with their wealthier fellow' subjects. (Hear, hear.) He considered that this expansion was a wise polcy of which we should not be ashamed. le thought they were right in gathering the poor wherever they could get them, and in such a place as the boilding in which they were then assembled everything unfitting or inappropriate for the worship of God could be easily removed, while, upon other occasions, it could be devoted to purposes of secular instruction and amusement. They were often met with the observation that the churches which existeed were not full, but he believed the more the working classes could be brought together in places like the prescnt the more reason would there he to hope that, in the course of time, they would be brought to the publiec worship of God in their own church. Hear, hear.) He would only further state on this subject that when the Rev. Mr. RowseU asked permission to use the building as a place of public worship he had given a hearty assent to the proposal, as he believed such Christian uses were not contrary to law, and he was himself anxious that the experiment should be fully and fairly tried; and now that he had an opportunity of addressing persons uwhom he might not see again for some time he would like to give expression to the feelings which were suggested to his mind on visiting that poor and distant portion of his diocess. It was a circumstance inseparable from the state of society in which we lived, and a great evil, that the rich and poor should be constantly diverging from one another by the way in which the great towns of the empire were extending. He had lived for the last seven years in a great rnanufacturing town,where he had an opportunity of seeing, in a smal sphere, that social s-ocess of change which was going on in the larger sphere of London. It was a natural tendency that all those whose capital was employed in manufactures in large towns should themselves retire to the country beyond the sound of their own wheels, and beyond the reach of the smoke which their manufactories engendered. This was but natural, but it seemed to him to be very deplorable. (Hear, hear.) It brought into the State two nations instead of one-a nation of the rich on the one hand, and a nation of the poor on the other-s-parated not merely by their feelings, tastes, and desires, but even in their local habitations. (Hear, hear.) The one was enabled to be transported to fresh air and the peaceful relaxation of the coantry, while the others, unable to avail themselves of those blessings, were crowded together in narrow squalid streets, into which the rich ne ver penetrated. These physical differences, ho feared, would soon produce moral differences. Those who never saw each other could not be expected to feel much for each other; and therefore it was of the greatest importance that those to vwhom God had given the advantages of wealth and all its attendant blessings should distinctly consider it a part of their duty to mix more with the poor, to see more of their dwellings, and to learn to love the poor, ard to look upon them as one with themselves. We all knew how badly we should get on were it not for the labouring population. Talk of the advantages of wealth-talk of the importance in a Focial point of view of a respectable middle class-but where, he would ask, would society be without the brawny arms and stout manly hearts of the labouring poor ? (Hear.) Wewereundertbe greatest obligations to them, and we were bound to discharge ourselves of that obligation by religiouslyassistingtheminthqgreat difficulties to which they were exDosed. (Hear, hcar.) It was quite true that poverty woulid never cease out of the land, for such was the Divine w}ll; but it was equally true that poverty was a perpetual reminder to the rich of what were their duties to tbe poor. It was the Divine will that tbe poor should perpetually remain in the land to remind us that as they were like us in the first moment of life, so would it be atits close; that the diffierence of rank was a distinction for a few years only, and there was no man, however highhe might be in the opinion of the world, who should not remember that the poorest child in that ragged school was his equal before God, and thatthey would be equal when all the distinctions of external rank had faded away, and the possessions of this world were as nothing. He knew that to indulge in this strain was but commonplace, butit was rightthat they should remind themselves of those things, and he believed that in no way could the rich better serve the poor than by assisting in the erection of schools such as tha; which they were suet that day to inaugurate. It was impossibletoover-estimnate the blessing which such an institution might do in such a neighbourhood. (EIear, hear.) Each poor child instructed at that establishment might be a missionary to its parents; for it was well known that a child religiously brought up had a zeligious influence over a whole family. How soon might not the habits which engendered misery in the homes of the poorest classes disappear -under the influence of the Gospel of Jesus Christ! (Hear. hear.) He trusted that through the instrumentality of that school the. parents of the children trained within its walls would make it a practice to attend on Sundays and join in the services of the church, that the careles would be led to think of the immortality of the soul and the great end and object of existence, and to feel that there was One who cared for them in all their distresses and in a3l their trials, even that Lord and Saviour who passed His days among them, who Hinself was one of tbem, 'who loved them still, and who in aU His words and deeds was an example of what real sympathies with the poor was. (Hear, hear.)
The Rev. T. RowsErM, having read letters of apology from Lord Robert Grosvenor, MA, and Mr. Butler, MJ?. (the latter enclosed a donation of 101.). observed that eight years ago the church of St. Peter's, Stepney, was erected through the exertions of Bishop Blomfield. He was hapy to say that there was but little room to sparein that oburob, and yet it was a fact that only two out of every tan of the entire population even worshipped God on His own day. The p4rish of Stepney contained a 'population of 80,000, and there was but church accommodation for 6,000. It was a sad thing to be obliged to state that that great parish was under sequestration, and that the income was raid only nominally to the clergy; in fact, the whole parish was in p awn. «s much as a watch was at a pawnbroker's. ("Hear, tear, *and laughter.) Thousands were alienated from the church from its qolduess and apathy; but it only needed the energy and devotion of its pastors to bring back its children to the fold. The ret. gentIenian concluded by
stating that he bad been assisted in his endeaLours to pro. 'mote churdh accommodation by many of the principal manufacturers in the district; but that the altered state of society, and the alienation of the rich from the poor, had impoverished the parish, and thrown the most serious 'diffculties in the way of evangelizing that poor and neglected neighbourhood.
The Right Hon. W. E. GLADnsTONE, VP., then moved the first resolution, 'which was as follows -
That separation of rich and poor by their several residences at the east and west of London demands the active interchange of loTe and co-operation to sustain real church membership; and that every worek of the Church of England in educating and teaching the poor and crowded population has a claim upon the -istaLce of the ric.er members.n
The right hon. gentleman said,-It 'would have been far more agreeable to me attending on this occasion to listen to such addresses as those which we have heard, and to meditate upon them, than to trouble you with any remarks of my own. We have heard the bishop of the diocess, with the authority that belongs to his high station and character, give his full sanction to the remarkable and somewhat novel work herein hand; and we have heard your pastor address you with a warmth and power which will go someway to account for the influence which he has obtained among you and for the fruit which has blessed his lahours. (Hear, hear.) My duty is a very humble and simple one; and I would rather have discharged it by simply reading the words of the resolution. I am here for the purpose of acknowledging a great necessity, and would to God that any words that I can employ could serve to make that necessity-I will not say more known in the abstract, but more felt, more acknowledged, and more applied in a practical sense both by niyself and the many thousands whom that necessity concerns. Your pastor has assigned to me the most appropriate duty which I could discharge, and he has asked me to move a resolution that the separation of rich and poor by their several residences in the east and west of London demands the active interchange of love and co-operation to sustain real church muembership; and that every work of the Church of England in educating and t1aching the poor and crowded population has a claim upon the assistance of the richer niembers of that Church. Novw, the right rev. prelate has already dwelt upon both, but especially upon the first of those propositions, in a manner which really leaves nothing to be desired. He has told us with sad and painful trath that the doctrine that we are bound together in one body-that one body of our Lord, aDd that, in virtue of that sacred relation, we are obligated to bear offices of mutual
love the one to the other-he has also told us that these | things have become the commonplaces of our knowledge. There was a time when, so far from being commonplaces, that proposition and other kindred propositions were not so much as dreamt of on the face of the earth. (Hear.) There was a time when they were not commonplaces, but great and startling discoveries, and that time was the advent of our Lord, and of His first preaching the Gospel on the earth. It was that which first revealed to f0llen races what relation they stood in to each other; it was that which substituted the law of peace for the law of mutual war among nations, and which substituted among individuals the law o: love and the interchange of good offices for relations depending simply upon power on the one side and suffering upon the other. Applause.) Then those things were great discoveries and acknowledged truths; they are no longer discoveries, but the truth, by repet.ition, has not, indeed, lout its vitality, hut we have lest the real and satisfaction andenergywith 'which thesethings 'were once received. The words, indeed, fall upon the ear, but they pass by like the idle wind. But the time has come when society must be awakened to the consequences that under those truths there lies a meanir- 'which if we do not attend to it in the daily exercises of life, we may yet live to deDlore the consequeneces of orr neglect. The separation of the'rich and the poor, by their separate residences in the east and thewest of London, is not to be denied. I have livedin the west-end of London for a quarter of a century, andduringthat periodwe have seen two great cities, as I may call them-the one at the north and the other at the south of Hyde Park-added to that part of the metropolis. When we wander through the splendid strects and spacious squares of these districts, and survey their beauty and costliness, we are inclined to exclaim, "W Vhere are the poor?" (Hear, hear.) We see on every side the mansions of the wealthy-we see the highly embellished and decorated shops w'sich minister to their luxury; but we scarcely see, with limited exceptions, any representatives of the labouring classes of the metropolis. (Hear.) And yet, I apprehend, it is an unquestionabletruth, and the necessary result of the law by which society is constructed, that every house -which is built for a nobleman, a banker, or a e-erchant, in Beigrave or Eton square, or the adjacent streets, generates a certain amnount of population which is cast unon the eastern districts, removed out of sight and unhappily'out of mind; bu t here continually gro wing and multiplying immortal soals, living, dying, and passing into the grave, hundreds of thousands of whom we know nothing, hear nothing, upon whom we never look, yet whom we have practically called into existence, for whom we generally do nothing, and for whom what is done is accomplished by an infinitely small partion of the public residiung among them., and composed of men of the dass to which Mr. Rowvell belongs. (Applause.) This is indoabtedly a serious and appalling state of things. It is hardly possible to hope that it will receive more than mitigation; but at the same time great mitigation it may receive. (Hear.) Although the honoured name of Bishop Blomfield has already been mentioned, I may perhaps be permitted to remr;nd the meeting that to him we owe the Vetropolitan Visiting and Relief Association, which was the first recognition in a permanent form of the duty of the 'west towards the east of London, for it was founded with the express anticipation that through its medium a portion of the enormous wvealth expended on the enjoyment of the west-end of the town might be made available for the temporarynecessities of the east. (Hear, hear.) I wisbh to appear here to-day in some acknowledgment of the obligation which the 'west owes to the east, and to extend the princi,ole from temporal necessity to the higher and more sacrea obligatica 'w,hich has beenhbrought under our notice. 'l'he institation to 'which I have referred cannot contemplate any large measure of moral or social improvement. Its duty is to heal, as it were, the sores of Lazarus, and to a iTrd some relief to the greatest calamities of men; but we have now a more extended scheme-that every member of the Church of England, in educating and teaching the poor in the neglected and crowded districts, has a direct claim upon the assistance and sympathy of ner richer membe.s. (Hear, hear.) The work heoe begun appears to me to have features of extraordinary interest. (Hear.) WVe have lived down to a time when, so far as regards the population of London and of the other great towns of the empire, through the rapid multiplication of population, long neglected, and other disorganizing influences which attend therapid growth of overcrowded districts, the clergy who labour among the classes who earn their daily bread by the sweat of their brow have to face the work of their profession under a form altogether new (hear, hear), and when those classes have fallen out of the traditional observan-ce of religion the clergymen have to undertake a missionary work of extraordinary difficulty. They have to invade a kingdom more difficult than the original heathen world, and to bring to Christianity those to whom Christianity was only a name. (Applause.) I repeat that they are placed in circumstances of extraordinary difficulty, for the great powers and resources which the Church of England derives in raral parishes from the relative support of its memcbers, the unbroken condition of its conmmunity, and the respect entertained by the people for the offices of the Church combine to make the duty of the pastor comparatively easy, but here their auxiliary induences are gone. We set down men in the midst of a vast population, and, instead of giving them command and temporal resources to compsnsate for the absence of the wealthier classes they are generally men who have a hard battle to supply themsselves with the necessaries of life, even u-ben those necessaries are estimated on the most moderate scale. (Hear, hear.) Vhatever acomulating difficulties have they not to contend with ? and yet, while we accumulate the difficulties, 'we enhlance the demands upon their labour. In a district like this, inhabited by an immense number of persons, the clergyman is required to be the universal father of the people. He has not the landlord or the squire to share his responsibilities and burdens. He has not simply to preach to the people and to recover them to the knowledge of Christ by a direct agency, but he must have a concern for everything that regards the social improvement and intellectual training of the young and old; and the whole of this charge-the office and interchanrge of sympathy and kindness, added to the training and guiding of his people in religioas truth-the whole of this charge, in the absence of the upper classes of society, falls, almost undivided, in the shoulders of the clergy. (EIear, hear.) It w_s a fine and noble saying, aluhough it was a heathen sentiment, that to see a brave man struggling with adversity was a noble spectacle, and so I say it is a noble spectacle scarcely to be matched in the 19th century when we see a brave clergyman struggling with adversity; for they are -61 in adversity who labour in these districts. They may be blessed with health and suficiency; they mnay, under the bltssing of DivineXProvidence, be blessed with a domestic circle, and reap its joya;* but the condition of those pastors who have to face an appalling amount of social misery and
s~norance is, and ever must be, a condition of adversity. The state of those who when they look around see nothing but a gulf of darkness an4 despair is a perpesual afaliction. Here is a man of no common energy, and yet he does not scruple to tell you that there are times, and times not rare, when the exhaustion and discouragement entailed by his labour drive him almost to despair. (Hear.) It is hard, but I will not say too hard, for there is auother side to every spectacle of trial and suffering. This is the law by which the highest results are 'worked out; this is the way by 'which the loftiest stages of Christian heroism are attained; and I will not say that those who achieve them are to be pitied; but I will say that they are to be sympathized with and assisted. I trust the time has comue when it has pleased God to multiply the class of pastors to which Mr. Bowaslihbelo (Hear, hear.) They see before them a great portion of the noble English nation, which unhappy circumstances have separated from the infleences of religion. To labour an6ew in that long untrodden fiild is an arduous, hut not a bopeless task. (Hear.) Never shall wYe see the man enter on his labour in a right spirit to whom some adequate return will not be yielded-who
not be able, even in the darkest periodsof adversity, to desery the dawn of a brighter day. Iamearnestlydesirous that the cause of this particular district should be made mere widely known, for, although there are many Places in a similar condition, this seems as if intended by Divine Providence to lift up the standard to those wrho are desponding. Here the results are such as to astonish even the most sanguine. (Hear, hear.) We have heard something of the results (hear, hear), and, although we have beard with no smuall wonder sand admiration the extent of what has been done, I feel we have reason to rejoice in the quality of the work as much as in the quanrity. Here there is no catching at means which might answer for a day, and lead to the publication of long reports in the daily journal,. Here there are mo
appeals to meretricious attractions (hear); the stonLe has
keen solidly laid; the church hap *en, from tbe_ground; and an attempt hs beeni made'toforii anew the character of those who come within jtsirals, And to produoe, not 3nerely a momentary ebitement, buLt n 'alterd modeeof life-a desire to cling to what is noble, and to avoid that which is impure and debasing. ,tCheers.) May it pl,se God that the seed which four pastor has sown maybring forth all the frait he can desire.; and may instances of districts, such as this, blessed with faithful and energetic pastors, multiply and extend; and, although notoriety is not, that which they desire, may the assemblage which has been brought here to"day, and the circumstances under which this school and church have been iraugurated, assist in revealing and disclosing to us at the west of London the ilmuense mass of duty which is lying neglected almost within arm's length, which it is incumbent upon us to discharge, but which unhappily has hitherto received too little of the attention which it ought to have been our delight, even as it was once our obligation, to' render to it. (The right hon. gentleman sat down umid loud applause.)
Tbe Rev. F. D. 3LkUyIcz seconded the resolution. The rev. gentleman observed that, although he belonged neither to the east nor to the west, he could not help feeling that there was a burden placed tn the west which it could not shake off. He believed the rich would receive a blessing, the extent of -which they could scarcely estimate, if they vwere to come audd ndx with the working classes, forhe considered they needed the contact far more than the poor. The west would derive as great a blessing from the east as the east could desire from the west, for it needed to be refreshedL with the manly strength of the strong and brave classes who formed the working millions of the laxd. The most distinguished men the country ever produced wera bor in the east of London, and in the east would still be found the best elements out of which a great nation could be formed.
The resolution was put, and carried unanimously. Mr. W. Corrom. moved the next resolution:-
" The vitality of church memubesbips should be expressed by active brotherhood; aud tie lab,'uring classes, while they so largely contribute to the strength and happiness of the country, need thet-upathiee and efforts of those who have received a higher educatiox than themaselves,"
The Rev. Canon CHAMY?fEYS seconded the resolution, which met with the cordial support of the meeting.
The Rev. Dr. HYSSEY, master of the Merchant Taylors' School, moved,-
That the efforts which axe being made in this disrict consisting o .600 personsn mostly of ttie Poorer classei, deserve confidence a,D helj."
Mtr. LLLx1y seconded the resolution, which was carried, and, after a vote of thanks to the right rev. prelate for presiding, the meeting separated.

Emporio Italiano.
EAfPOARO ITALIAXO.
On Saturday a large meeting, composed of persons evidently belonging to the higher classes of society, was held at the Hanover-square Rooms, to hear the particulars respecting an " institution for the patronage of Italian science art, literature, commerce, and industry," which, under the name "Emporio Italiano," has been projected by Count Lorenzo Montemerli, and has recently been a subject of frequent discussion in literary circles. The large box at the further end of the room was occupied by the MIarquis of Downshire, under whose superintendence means are to be adopted for carrying the project into effect.
A programme, setting forth iu three languages fun3 details of the scheme, w.vas placed in the hands of every visitor. Into these details it is npnecessary to enter. We may briefly state that the design of the " Emporio " is one of the most comprehensive that the imagination could conceive. To a museum filled with specimens of Italian art and industry are to be attached a hal, not only for experiments, but for musical and dramatic performances; a club-room, a, library, a panorama, a cosmorama, a diorama, an amphitheatre for lectures, and a primary schooL The benefit of the Italian people is the object for which all these various departments are designed, whether as means of instruction and amusement or as sources of revenue. Even the museunim falls into two departments, consisting of a gallery devoted to, per nanent exhibitions and a bazaar, in which various artides will be sold. Broad as the plan may appear from the enumeration of the sections into which the " Emporio" is divided, we have not yet stated the whole of it; proposed fanctions. Prizes are to be offered to Italian auithors of new inventions, relief is to be afforded to Italians in distress, and Italian eeania are to be invited from their country to remain in London during each summer season to hold a scientific congress. Politics and religion are exduded from the project, that two fruitful causes of dissension may be removed, and that all Italians, of whatever shade of opinion, may co-operate barmoniously for the good of Italy. Finally, that the " Emporio" may be in constant communication with the public, English and Italian, a sort of art-journal, in three languages, will be published as the record of its achievements and the organ of its views,
The speakers of Saturday evening were Professor A Vera, formerly of the College of France, and a well-knovw
writer on German philosophy, who is established as literarydirector of the " Emporio;" Count hIonteruerli, the pro jector; and Signor Banieri, a young Italian painter, who ardently expressed his adhesion to the scheme. In addition to the speeches in which the principles of the proposeed institution were set forth, and its claims to the sympathy of Englishmen were warmly urged, a contract between the ,Marquis of Downshire and CountlMontemerliwas read bythe latter. In this document the manner in which the contracting parties intend to co-operate with each other in carrying out the project are succinctly stated. An initiative comnittea is to be formed at once, and, while the seat of the executive, wfill always be in London, assistant-committees are to be formed in various Italian towns. One of the most singular features connected with the "Emporio" consists in the fact that it does not appeal to self-interest, but to zeal for the cause of Italy. Certain privileges are, indeed, offered to subscribers, but these have nothing in common with the "dividends" of joint-stock- companies. Therefore, if the magnificent design is ever realized, it will be by a system Of gratuitous contributions. bluch eloquence is employed by Professor Vera, who has written the "programme." to show that in this part of the plan there is nothing chimericaL however much the worldly-minded may feel disposed to think other-wse.
The speeches were entirely in Italian, thongh probably as many English as Italians were among the audience. Count blontemerli is highly respected in this country as a zealous patriot, who has kept himself distinct from the republican celebrities in London, and hence the announcement of his project had excited a great deal of curiosity. The Drinciples explained were heard with marked approbation, and when the business of the evening was concluded the audience wera recreated with a concert, in which many leading artists assisted.

THE EXECUTION OF VERGER.
(FrROt OUR OWN CORRESDONDUT.)
PARIS, FRIDAY, JAN. SO, 6 Y.Y.
You are already aware that the appeal of Verger was rejected yesterday by the Court of Cassation. I have to add that his petition to the Emperor for a pardon or commutation shared the same fate. But little time was allowed to elapse between the final determination of the Court and the last act of the tragedy which opened at St. Etienne-du-Mont. There was no object to be gained by prolonging the agony of the criminal a day or two longer. For him hope had oeased to exist, and the sooner the pang was over the better. Orders were given last iught for the execution to take place to-day, and this morning at half-past 8 o'clock the criminal expiated his gailt on the scaffold. He who for a long year had brooded over murder, and who, withoAt hesitation or compunction, stabbed to the heart his unoffending and defenceless victim-he who had in solitude conceived, cherished, and perpetrated his crime-trembled at the last moment when the real terrors of violent death displayed themselves before his own eyes.
The order of the Court for carrying out its sentence was received at the prison of La Roquette at midnight. The bearer was the executioner himself. At 2 o'clock this morning the scaffold was already eiected in front of the prison. In spite of the silence which had been oberved as to the day of the execution, and the early hour at which the preparatior:s were made, an immense crowcd assembled on the spot, and so early as 3 o'clock a considerable number of carriages was arriving. Before 7 o'clock the Place de la Roquette and the streets adjoining were crowded. The whole of yesterday Verger passed in a state of feverish restlessness; his agitation increased as the day wore on. He frequently asked questions about what was going on in the Court of Cassation, and manifested intense anxiety as to the result of his appeal. As night came on he began to entertain hopes of its success, from the fact of his having received no news c2 the proceedings; and about 10 o'clock he asked those who watched him in his cell howr many days were usually accorded to convicts after the rejection of their appeal by the Court of Cassation. This question he repeated as the hour waxed later. Of the, Court he at last began to entertain mnisgivings ; but he still clung tenaciously to the hope that his safety would come from the Emperor, and that the capital sentence would be commuted to perpetual banishment. He threw himself on his pallet but for some time he found little repose. His agitation was extreme, and his alumbers feverish, till 2 o'clock, when, nature being exhausted, he fell iuto a profound sleep which was not broken by the noise made by the workmen in preparing the scaffold. It lastedtil half-past 7, when the Direetor of the Prison, the Inspector-General, the Chief of Police, and the chaplain (Abb6 Hugon), came to awaken him, and announce the terrible news that his last hour was approaching,and that he must preparefor death. It was the chaplain who undertook the office of informing him that his appeal had been rejected, that his petition to the Emperor was equally unsuccessful, that no further hope remained, and that all that was now left him was to prepare for death. The wietched man raised himself on his pallet, he held his head down for some instants, and turned it about bewildered, as if he had awoke from some terrible dream. When he became conscious of what was passing, and when the dismal words that hope was no more were fully comprehended by him, he cried " Impossible, imnpossible !" The chaplain repeated that, unfortunately, it 'was too true, and that all was over. At once he became excited, and his excitement rose to fury. " I wrill net die !" he shouted. " It is impossible that my appeal and my p anion are both refulsedimpossible ! I cling to liie; my life ismy own, and you have no right to take it from me !" The chaplain endeavoured to calm and console him, but in vain. He refused to listen to his prayers; he broke out into violence, and reviled the priest with language similar to that which he had used before the Court of Assize. The Director of the Prison at length interfered. Verger cried, " Give me but an hour-an hour-but one hour-no more. I must write-I must send an express to the Emperor !" The Director told him it was impossible. " Impos. aible ! no, I will not die! I will not-I will defend myself to the last ! You may murder me in this cell, but from it I will not stir !" At these words he threw himself again on his bed, clung to it with head, hands, and feet, and resisted all attempts to lift him. The gaolers had to be called in, and they were obliged to put on his clothes by main force. During this, operation Verger made the greatest res,istance, but, finding all his efforts vain, he all of a sudden relaxed and fell into a state of pros,tration.
At a quarter to S the executioner entered the cell to prepare him for the scaffold. Verger underwent this last operation without making a movement or uttering a word; he only shrank a little when the cold steel of the sci3sors that cut the hair from the back of the head touched his neck. The chaplain again approached him, and with tears in his eyes and a tremulous voice once more exhorted him to think of his soul. He at first listened to the priest in silence, and then retired with him to a corner of the celL. He knelt, joined in prayer, and probably confessed, forthe chaplain pronouncedthe absolution. 8 o'clock struck, and at the last stroke he issued fromthe cell, and proceeded to the scaffold. He appeared calmer, and almost resigned to his fate. Nevertheless, when bidding farewell to the Director of the Prison and his assistants, he once more implor ed for one hour " to write to the Emperor." At a few minutes after 8 he issued from the prison gate, when at once the scaffold, in al its hideous reality, met his eye. During the short passage he was supported by the chaplain on one side, and on the other by the Director of the Prison and the executioner. As he moved he was heard to utter the words " Amende h(morable-jamais ; plus tard." He mounted the steps of the platform slowly, and on reaching it he appeared as if he wished to speak, but any words he uttered w ere not heard distinctly. It was thought they were " Viva Jesus-Saure la Prance; saneve l'Empereur." He was again exhorted by the attendant priests. He knelt on the ,ground, and once utteredsome words-it is hoped of repent. ance for his crime, and prayer to Heaven forpardoa He slowly rose, cast a glance in the distance, took the crucifix in his hands and kissed the image of the Saviour; gazedforaninstant or tw0o onthe cold and clear sky above, llung himself into the arms of the Abbe Hugon, and then surrendered himself to the executioner. HIe was fastened to the plank, and his neck placed under the instrument of death. At the given signal it fell, flashing in the cold light of the morning, and all was over.
The morning was bitterly cold. It had frozen during the night, yet many persons must have remained on the ground throughout to witness the dreadful spectacle.
A telegraphic despatch from Marseilles, of the 50th, says :-
" Accounta from Naples of the 26th state %hat a priest had attempted to assassinate the Archbishop at Matara during the benediction. The prelate was wounded, and a canon who endeavoured to defend him was killed by the asM3,in. The Neapolitan Government has just issued a decree relative to a postal reform; other decrees are announced. The convention signed between the King of Naples and the Argentine Republic is for the cession of a portion of territory to which political prisoners will be sent at the expiration of the delay granted them to choose between a request for pardon and being sent into exile."
Lttersfrom Naples givo a sad account of the present state of a city once so brilliant and so gay.
lne severity of the Government increases to an intolerable pitch, and the King seems determined to
'withdraw himself altogether from the sight of the victims whom his agents persecute and torture. It is so81e satisfaction for his subjects that the tyrant himself is not happy, and that terror, if not remorse, accompanies this modern Louis Xr. in his Neapolitan Plessis-lea-Tours. lThe following is aletter just received from a member of a commuercial estabJ.ishmnent in Naples, who mixes very little, if at all, in politics, and who only describes what happens before3 his eyes:
"Naples, Jan. 22.
o lrt weekkwe had fresh arrests. It is caloulated that there are now about 600 persons in prison, not to speak of
a dozeu coffeeheuses *nd the ume number of estaminets
and publichoesesslut up. For the last two days the polioe hve desisted from the razzias, which menaced the whole city. If the suspected were taken up Naples would be completely dopopulated. There is no longer room ia the p Dn. Those who mcooeded in obWaini

tbe night in the Vicaria in. a damp, qoufLnQd room, without, panes of glass in the windows and without light, and the, only furniture two large reservoirs,, which are used for the same purpose as the vsapasiennes of Paris. They had neither a chair, nor a pallet, nor a fLroduring the long winter's night. Moreover, the regulations of our prisons require that the hats and caps of the prisoners shall be taken away. and they are restored to them when they are set at liberty. Amnong the prisoners there was also a good number of Royalists, for at the present moment the Government does not act tenderly with its friends. One of these gentlemen, an obscure journalist, told who he was. He was taken before Spagnolis, the Commissioner of Prisons, and was about to be released, when he happened to-. remark that such conduct was hardly to be matched at Tunis. Spagnolis, who makes us even regret the, golden age of Varza and Co., had him seized and again led back to prison, where he received a fair number of blows, in order to tewh him how he darad to compare the Government of-a Mussulman with that of the 'holiest son of the Churoh,' as Plo Nono calls the King, and whom the Demagogues call Bomba. The razzias have ceased, but not the arrests. In the middle of the street, and in broad daylight, the Commissaries of Police, who patrol the town, stop numbers of people, search their pockets, their pocketbooks, and even their purses. They beat them, insult them, and, at the slightest marmur, carry them off. The consequence is, that when a police patrol is observed in the distance men and womnen scamper off in all direotions.
" The King has definitively quitted Naples. He went to Caserta on the 12th, his birthday, at 3 in the afternoon.
They expeoted him at the railroad; but the King, who is I afraid of powder, of lucifer matches, and of gas, begins now to have a horror of railroads. le prefers travelling ia his carriage, surrourded by two squadrons of Hussars, at full trot. His Majesty gave 8 ducats to each horseman. At Caserta the same largesse was bestowed. There also two or three cafis hav been ahut up. Some gaspipes have been destroyed, and others radled in. In that Eusrial of the Neapolitan Philip IL no one is allowed to penetrate except a few pr.es*s-not even the Ministers. He does not go abroad, and no longer holds reviews of the troops. He dis. trusts his brothers andhis eldest son, andhe begins to entertain grave suspicions of the electric telegrap' ! The priest; themselves who wait on the King are aid to be searched before they are allowed to enter, to see that they have no weapons about them. Oar existence is becoming insupportable, but that of the Kng himself is not less so. Much uneasiness prevails in Sicily, and demands have been made for more troops. A brigade bas left for Calabris, to act a5 a flying column; it is commanded by General Alfonaz de Rivera. Since the departurelof thc King we are more tranquil on the subject of explosions; but not so as regards disturbance. HisMaestyhas orderedmoney tobedistributed amongtheLazzaroni;andsomeofthechiefs,partisularlyCapo. puopolo, have received a good sum. We have now little hopes of getting rid of the Swiss, I myself heard in a cafJ at the Lago delle Pigne some of the officers say in a loud voice that they were too 'wel off at Naples to do so foolish a tbing as to get themselves killed by the Prussians.
" Since 1849 the carnival at Naples has declined, but this year it is much more sad than usual. People dance no longer, not even at private parties. The aristocracy, poor, or avaricious, or timid, have quitted. The middle dass are either in mourning for members of their families who have been condemned, or, if they be Liberal, fear to show themselves, and are hated if they continue any relations of interest with the Government. Commercial activity has ceased, and there appears no future for any class. I do not know to what extreme despair will drive us ; but what I know is that this state of affairs cannot much longer be supported by any one. Naples is no longer a city of theliving, it has become another Pompeii. At 9 o'clock at night you no longer see any one In the streets but patrols of sirri and gendarmes. The few foreigners who are still here live only among themselves, and are bored to death. News papers are of oourse not received.'
It is stated that the English and French Governments have instructed their respective ambassadors to intimate to the Austrian Government their great satisfaction at the conduct of the young Emperor at Mian in granting so complete an amnesty. Some of the political prisoners have, it is said, refused to quit the place of their confinement. They are informed that if they do not wish to leave quietly they will he expelled by force. Some people here suppose that, as the Emperor Napoleon expresses such great admiration of his brother Emperor, he will not fail to follow his example, and grant a general amnesty in turn.
I have already alluded to the reductions required in France by the state of the finances, and earnestly desired, I believe, by the Emperor. The army, lt is said, will be reduced by 42,000 men, not perha;D all at once, but gradually. The savings in this respect are estimated at 26,000,000f., and in the navy 10,000,000f. With the reductions in nearly all branches of the Administration, it is calculated that the total saving will be 100,000,000f.
M. Bonnechose, Bishop of Evreux, is named Archbishop of Tours, in place of M. Morlot, appointed to Paris.
A number of gentlemen, amounting to 100, formerl students at the Coll6ge de Henri IV., now the yc6ee Napoleon, dined together yesterday at Lemardelay's, in the Rue Richelien. ML Emile Augier, the poet and candidate for the honours of the French Academy, was in the chair. The first toast proposed was "the Absent," which was received with much applause. The political sense attached to the words, and understood by all present, referred to the Princes of the Orleans family, who were educated at the College. After dinner a collection was made for those who had fallen into poverty. It was announced that the Princes of Orleans had sent their subscriptions to the President to futher the objects of the meeting.
A baUl was given last night at the Tuileries. Of the Diplomatc Corps, Ambassadors only were invited, excepting one Minister Plenipotentiary, who has the "brevet" rank of Ambassador, namely, M. Hatzfeldt, and what is termed the Diplomatic corps de ballet, that is, the attaches of the various missions who are found to be good dancers. The others, who have given no proofs of their excellence in this sine szi now condition, remained at home.
The receipts of the Paris and Orleans Railway Company for the week ending the 21st of January amount to 1,012,640f. 75c., being an increase of 129,714f. 94c., as compared with the corresponding week of last year. The total receipts from the 1st to the 21st of January amount to 2,933,879f. 84c., being an increase of 476,450f. 75c. over the same period of the year 1856.

PARIS, SAT=RDAY, JAN. 31, 6 r.m.
The details given in the papers this morning of the execution and last moments of Verger differ in no one material point from the account in my letter of yesterday. They speak of the samne violence in words and acts when the news was first communicated to him of the rejection of his appeal and his petition to the Emperor for a commutation of his sentence; and the same prostration-perhaps, resignation-at the last, when he became fully convinced that hope was over, and that the world was about to close on him for ever. The public was naturaUy anxious to know if he admitted the justice of his punishment, and expressed repentance and sorrow for his crime, and wilingness to admit the only consolation which remained to him,that of religion. On this most important point one could not be very affirmative. It was merely from the change in his demeanour when the fatal arrangements for the scaffold were made, and from his acts on the scaffold, that one Wa led to believe his mind had at last been led to the consciousness of his awfUi situation, and that, pethap5, he may have died repentant. What Passed between him and his confessor during the few minutes they remained apart in the dark corner of his cell, what secret he may
have imported to himnat thatnmorment, no one caa ever know; but from the fact of the chaplain htavin
pronounced over him the absolution of the Church at the close of his brief confession it may be pre-
sumed that he complied with the indispensable con-
dition of that. obiranoeby an'act of contrition. As it is n6wheo mentioned that he received the last sacrament it is probable thlat the chaplain did not consider him in a proper:state of mindXfor an act so sacred. I have noticed the change which took place in him from the moament that he was prepared for the scaffold. I complete this part of the account from the ?Jniver:-
" Verger decLared (says the clerical organ) th%t he desired to die like a Christian; that he deplored his crime; thWt he abjured the errors professed in his writings and dis. courses, and that he accepted the sacrifice of his life ia expiation. He then prayed the Abbe Eugon to hear him, and zetiring with him to a corner of his' cell he went on his ,cnees, confessed, and received absolution, and ex.hibited before everyone present marks of the mnost profound and sincere repentance. Then the prayers for the agonizing were recited, and he himself made the responses. During the passage to the scaffold he did iot cease to testify his repen. tanoe, and to protest his sincerity. He repeated in a voice as distinct as his exhausied condition permitted these words,-' vivc notre &?gneur Tesus Christ I Vive e Dieu d'amour I Lamb of God, who takest away the sins of the world, havemercy on me!r When he mounted the scaffold ho aked to be allowed to kneel, and then, having charged the chaplain to make in his name reparation to his ecclesiastical superiors, he prayed for his family, for France, for the Church, for the whole world, and for the Emmeror. He then kissed the crucifix twice, embraced the chaplain aud,quietly gave himself up to the executioner."
.The Panas publishes a communication from the Black Sea, which states that the commiesioners appointed to define the newv boundary between the Danubian provinces and Russia, and who were still at Constantinople when the-layt French mail left that city, had quitted Constantinople and proceeded to Isnail, wfiere they arrived on the afternoon of the 17th it. The;y proposed to leave immediately for ,the IJpper Yalpuck where Colonel Bseson, the French conunissioner, bad preceded them to trace the new territory of Ko3nrath.
The Montit cur says:
!'In order to graduaLy reduce the army to a peace foot. ing the Emperor has just ordered 46,000 temporary aud re. newable furloughs to be granted. Similar ones, io the nutmber of 95,000, had been previously issued, making the total of the soldiers thus sent to their homes for an uni linmited period 141,00). These 46,000 new furloughs are to be divided among the classes of 1850, 1851, 1852, and 1853 according to a list drawn up by the M1inister of War. The departures from the various regiments wil take place by classes, beginning with that of 1850, and with some days interval between ea"h."
The. Moniteur publishes a decree making one promotion to the rank of commander in the Legion of Honour, - two to that! of officer, and 15 nominations to-that of knight, among officers and non-commissianed otcers of different, regiments. Another decrea confers the military medal on 13 non-commissiohed officers aud privates.

This winter has been remarkable for the number of shipwrecks on this coast. The French brig Themuis, coming from the Levant with a cargo of hideC and tallow, was caat ashore near the chapel of Montredon at 2 o'clock yes,terday mornmng. The crew were saved, and it is, hoped that the cargo likevwise may be saved, but the rig is a perfect wTreck.
The, Tunisian frigate Begi arrived here yesterday. Count Segur, attached to the French embassy at Rome, has arrived here, on his way to Paris, together with General Clark, from lalta, and General de Tourville, from Aliers.
'We have experienced a sharp frost for the last two night,, and, a letter from Clermont, in the Puy de Dome, states that since 1829 so great a quantity of snow has not been s,een in that country. The road from Aurillac to Arvant is completely blockedup with snow. The coach roads of Tulle Lunoges Montlucon, Thiers, and Ambert are passable;
the diligences arrive from two to three hours beyond their time.
AUSTRIA.
(FROx OUR oWrN OORsoDENDT.)
VIENNA, JAN. 28.
Yesterday afternoon the Imperial "HandbUlet" (autograph letter) relative to the general amnesty was telegraphed from Milan to this city in the Italian language, but no translation of it will be given to the public, as a copy of the original (German) document must reach Vienna in a few hours. The Archduchess Sophia has received a second tele-
,raphic communication from the Emperor, in which His Majesty says that he is " satisfied" vith the behaviour of the Milanese. The last words of the despateh are, "All is going' well." Several confidential comnmuications uhave been received from Austrian employgs in Milan to their colleagues in this city, and the tenour of all of them is the same, or very nearly so. The reception given to their Majesties by the people was infinitely better than was expected, and the behtviour of the greater part of the nobles was " becoming" (answtndig). At the irst appearance of the Emperor and Empress at the Scala eight boxes were vacant, but the assertion of the Turin writers for the pres that most of the others were flUled by the families of emplomjs is incorrect. Almost all the boxes at the Scala are taken for the season by the noble and wealthy Milanese, and eight of them would certainly not have remained empty on such a festive occasion if the authorities had not respeeted the rights and privileges of private individuals. That the pit and galleries were almost exclusively occupied by military men and ernployjs cannot be doubted, for such is always the case in Austria when there is thMlere Jparg. Duke Litta has frequently been at Court, but his brother, the Count, is still one of the leaders of the Opposition. Count Litta, who makes no secret of his dislike to the Austrians, walked in the Corso with the Countess, his wife, while the Empress was holding her drawing-room.
A few days since you were informed that the excessive hostilityofthe Sardinianpress had givengreat offence here, and information has now reached me that Count Paar, t-he Austrian Charge d'Affaires at Turin, has demanded from the Turin Government the prosecution of the tTaione for a leader c la
zazzini. The article alluded to was made up of
extracts from the Old Testament, tending to show that it is lawful to put rulers to death if they oppress their subjects. The Austrians affirm that the object of the writer was to excite some political fanatic to make an attempt onthe life of theEmperor Francis Joseph, but on reading the article attentively it struck me that it was addressed to the Mazzinists in Naples.
My letter of the 2d, which was lost in the Violet, contained a piece of information that it may be as well to repeat, as the news will not fail to produce a prodigious sensaton whenit is publicly known here. During the last 20 years an Austrian priest named Gunther has written several works, in which he endeavours to prove that revealed religion has a philosophical basis. The doctrines taught by M. Gunther have found favour with many of the most distinguished men in the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church in Austria, and among others with Prince Schwarzenberg, the Cardinal Archbishop of Prague. In a word, almost all the younger priests in Autria are "Guintherianer ;" that is, " belevera in -the doctrines taught by Gunther." Some t hree years ago the Archbishop of Cologne denounced thle works of M4. Gunther So the "Congregation of the Holy Index," and accused their author of entertaining erroneous, if not poBitively heretica, opinions The works were examined by the lCongregaton," and condemned, but the Poe, who was aware that it. Gfunther was a shnng light in Auitria, refused to confirm the sentence. For a long
time nothing more was heard of£ M. Gunthers worksbut whemii 1heArchbiihop of Vienna was at
le tbqn4t ~-.-yea.nd-a half ago he- urged his Th)lJ1ls taL have them examined anew. A special onision, of Fhich. *ahmost~ all the members were Je5uits, was appointed, and the result of the examination .was that the doctrines of M. G5inther were declared to be erroneous, and his literary productions were placed on the -Index." The few Austrian priests wIho are already acquainted with the foregoing facts shrug their shoulders, and foretell that the Jesuits will, sooner or later, meet with. A defeat "where they least expect it," that is, in Austria. It may be as well to observe that when there was a censorship in AustiA M. Gunther was the ecclesiasticil censor of the Government, and consequently the person who had to decide whether a book treating of religious matters was fit reading for the 400,000 Catholic inhabitants of this city. It is a most i ficnt fact that M. Sebastian Brumner, the editor of the ChurdA Gazte, and a very violent Cath,olic, is beginningto turn his back on theJesuits. MIonsignor Geissel, the Archbishop of Cologne, is so desirous that Duns Scotus, the Doctor Subtilis, should be canonized, that he is going to Rome to see that the matter is taken in hand by his Holiness.
According to advices of the 24th from Berne the Federal Councld is resolved to make some improve, mentR in the military system of the Confederation. A larger pply of weapons, and more partiEcularly of iifles, will in future be kept in the arsenals of the different cantons, and the strength of the artillery will be increased. The fortifications at Basle are completed, and if the Prussians had marched against that city they would have found it protected by 14 earthworks, each of which is some 14 feet thlick. Ithas been observedthat the Swiss are in no Bra ur ortr oterhms n h slowrness of the movements of the sturdy mountaineers is generally attributed to the following passage in the note of the Monite,ur of the 23d
" Switzerland can now dismiss her troops." Tb.e policy of this Government on the NeuchAtel question has gven extreme offence to the Ultramontane part in Switzerland, and its leaders rail at Count Baol in good set terms. It is worthy of remlark that greater patriotism was nowhere displayed than in those Swiss cantons which in 1847 formed the Sonderbund.
In proportion as the Austrian forces are withdrawn from Moldavia and Wallachia,Turkish troops, to the number of 10,000, will march in, and remain until the reorganization of the Danubian Prncipalitlesisoompleted.TheTurkishcorpsofoccupation wil be under the command of Halim Pasha.
The bankers and merchants of Vienna are endeavouring to raise by subsription the sum of 40,0001., with which a commercial school is to be established and eudowed, but some of the most wrealthy Jewish inns have declared that they will not contribute anything, unless it is distinctly expressed in the statutes that non-Catholic teachers and students are not to be excluded from the establishnment. The High Church party is greatly disgusted, but every dispassionate person in Vienna approves the conduct of the Jews.
It is credibly stated, that at the sitting held last night by the Administrative Council of the Credit Bank it was resolved *-1. That a dividend of 12fl. per share over and above the 5 per cent. interest should be paid. 2. That 415,000fl. (10 per cent.) should be laid aside as a reserve fund. 3. That the Adminitative Council and Direction will only take 5 per cent. instead of the 10 per cent. taxti me to which the statutes entitle them.
PRUSSIA.
(FROM OUR OW-H conaOsroxNxDr.)
BERLIN, JAx. 29.
There is nothing even yet to be reported from here of a positive nature with regard to any attempt at arranging the mootpointof theKing of Prusia's sovereigntyof Neuchatel, which has been de facto in abeyance ever since 1848. Without pretending to know what may be going on in Paris, at the instigation of the Swiss Government, to bring about conferences, or pave theway forthe questionbeingsolved bymeans of diplomatic correspondence, I believe I can at least state that nothing definite has been settled there, inasmuch as, Prussia being one of the principals, something would be known here of any arrangement having been made, and I can find no trace at present of anybody's knowing anything of the sort. Although the question of- wbat terms the King will put forward as the condition of his ceding his rights is a secondary one in point of time, it is one of foremost importance for the King and his Government to decide upon before the meeting of conferences or the opening of negotiations. But even on this point I cannot find that any decision has been arrived at; the circumatences remain the same, as nearly as possible, as whenI last reported to you onthe subject, five days back. In Ministerial circles there seems to obtain the same conviction, that even if no indemnification be claimed for the cession of the sovereignty, &c., some equivalent must at any rate be demanded for the pecuniary rights that would be involved in that cession. The princely domains in the principality of Neuchatel and county of Valenginr were lately stated in an official publication to be estimated at 3,801,465f. ; that these domains had been ab antiato the property of the Prince of the time being, and that the Kings of Prussia had not only never dispossessed themselves of that property, but that no later than July, 1850, the present King had solemnly protested against an alienation of any portion of it. This claim for compensation for a real landed property to be given up entirely wil, perhaps, not be found to be incompatible with the views that are now being advocated very strongly at this Court by some of the clearest heads, viz., that it will be the wisest course for the King to reserve no claim of any sort, no property, no title, no protectorship in Neuchatel, as it would subsequertly only afford a ground for new complications, and, by taking the initiative in declari:ng his full intentions to do thls, he would gain credit for a frank and liberal line of conduct, and obviate the necessity for any European conferences. It cannot be denied that by superseding the necessity for the conferences, particularly if they are to be held in London, as, according to all probability, they would be, he would escape a great number of mortifications, while the full and frank renunciation of all his rights, which are more specious than solid, would fairly earn the approbation and respect of all men of decent feeling. The opportunity at the present moment is very favourable, as there is just now a transient lull both in diplomatic remonstrances and in newspaper outcry. As yet, however, there is but little solid ground for the hope that he will embrace these enlightened and liberal views. Herr von Bismarck Schonhausen, the representative of Prussia at the Federal Diet in Frankfort, has been summoned hither, as being one to whose voice the King sometimes listens in times of emergency, and it is believed that he is adding his suffrage3 to the various highly respectable names here already engaged in the advocacy of these views.
It is understood that the Grand Duke Constantine will return hither from Hanover next week for a short stay at this Court. Though there appear to be no definitive arrangements as yet made for his visit to Paris. it is believed that it will not be long before it is put into execution. For the present the Grand Duke and Duchess have left Hanover for Altenburg. There are people here who talk of the Emperor Alexander's coming here on a visit towards the end of February, and have arranged in their own minds already hon the Emperors of
Russia and France are to come together with the King of Prussia.

_ BROADBINT V. THE DIPERTATA A nlylPvA
(Before tac IoD C NCELWOIt.)
mLs case has been JO frequently before the Court of late that the facts must be quite familiar to our readers. The Vice-Chancellor granted a perpetual'injunction to restrain the defendants from making gas in certain retort-houses adjoining the plaintiff's market-garden at Fulham, and judgmeat was this morning given in the appeal from that decision.
The LORD CHAwCzLLOR, after going through the facts, aid that he entirely agreed with the opinion of Mr. Justice Cronmpton and Mr. Justice Wiles, that the right of the plaintiff to all action at law, or an indictment for a nuisance on a"count of his vegetables, &c., being injuriously affected by the makng of gas by the company in thQ retort-houses in question, was not taken away by the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act. The only other point to be determined was to see whether the evidenoe in the case was so conclusive as to entitle the plaintiff to the injylction asked. Now, if there had been-eo trial at law, he (the Lord Chancellor) should have felt it his duty to take the opinion of sucrat ribunal upon the case, as it was surrounded with difficulty. There had, however, been one tri at law, and, adthough it resuited in a reference, heraw nothing to doubt the cor. rectness of the finding of the arbitrator. That findin; was in favour of the plaintiff, and certainly afeer looking carefully through the affidavits, he (te Lord Chancellor) must confess that the preponderance of the evidence was in favour of the plaintiff. In short, some of the acientifio testimony placed it beyond all doubt that the vegetables, frit, and flowers of theplintiff ere injuriouslyaffected .by the smoke and gases evolved from the retort-houses of the defendants complained of. Upon the whole, therefore, he dil not think it necessary to sendthecase tobeagaininquiredinto at law, and, as the decision of Vice-Chancellor Wood was quite correct, the appeal must be dimissed with cots.

IN RE THE CAWiRRON AND COLEBROOK COAL AND IRON
xrmP -
Mr. GIY1FARD moved to iay the certificate of the Master in this case, whereby he had deceEe to make a call, and to direct him to make * call. Several years ago a number of the shareholders, being of opinion that the operations of the company ought not to be longer carried on, paid a sum of 9,OOOL in liquidation of certain debts then due, and with. drew from the company. The business was, however, continued, and ultimately the company was brought under the opertion of the Winding-up Act. The Master placed all the shareholders on the list of contributories, and one of the *seding shareholders, on behalf of himself and the others smilarly situated, appealed to this Court, and the Court held that he was liable. An appeal was then taken to the Lords Justices, who confirmed the decision of this Court, and thereupon a notice of appeal to the House of Lords was lodged. This was in 1854, and the appeal has not been heard. In the meanwhiles one or more of the creditors having threatened to sue individual shareholders, an appli catiomiwasmadeto the Master to make a call; butthe Mlaster refused to make it pending the appeal to the House Of LIords.
Mr. R. PAlnXER and Mr. SEL%YN having been heard for the other parties concerned,
His oN'oim said he was of opinion the call ought to be made. This Court ought to enforce its decrees, and it would be paralyzed unless it carried out its judgment, notwithstanding the appeaL. He should therefore mike an order that a call be made, bat with liwberty to the contri butones to make any application with regard to the circum. stances of the case, which would include everything connected with the appeal to the House of Lords.

Alr. BAILY and Mr. MARTlThXau moved in this case for an injunction to restrain the defendants, the West Somerset Mineral Railway Company, from cUtting or taking up the pavement of the pier at Watchett harbour, in Somerset hire, fm removing any portion of it, and from layingdown rails thereon. The plaintiffs claimed to be owners of the Foil as surviving devisees i trust under the wi of George, Earl of Egremont, and also to stand in the position of lords of the manor of the land upon which the pir of Watehett was built,which had theretoforebeen waste land of the manor, Lady Egremont being tenant for life. The pier and harbour of Watohett is situated on the Bristol Channel, aboLt 14 miles N.N.W. of Bridgewater, and was in former times a place of considerable trade, and sent members to Parliament, hut of late years the barbour has been chiefly used by vessels freighted with coals, limestone, ironstone, and alabaster, and abundance of seaweed was burned here for the use of the Bristol glass manufactories. The harbour is formed much in the ordinary way, with a breakwater at the entrance, having two rows of posts with rings standing near theinner coping, with sides, &c. The defendants, by reason of iron ore being found in the Brendon hills, obtained their act of Parliament, notwithstanding some opnosition, and purchased land down to the edge of the pier of the plaintiffs as lords of the manor of Watchett, and having by the 37th section of their act authority to take a lease of the pier, negotiations had been going on for some time with that object, but without success, and subseouently, alleging that the plaintiffl were not owners of the soil of the pier, but that it was, in fict, a highway, and, ssuch, open to be used by them on the sameterms as any otherhighwaywasused by ral,3vay companies, they proceeded to remove the pavemeor the purpose of constructing their railway upon it, so as to bring down ironstone, &c., and tilt it over from the waggons into the vessels attencding within the harbour to receive it. The plaintiffs then filed the present bll, foundin their title to the soil upon various acts of Parliament, and on length of undisturbed possession. In the first act, 6th of Anne, there was a redtal that whereas the town and borough of Watchett lay adjoining to the sea, and was found to bea place of great oonvenience to furnish with coals, iron, salt, &c., the ancient quay and pier being built on waste ground of the manor of Watchett (and which by reason of the violence of the seawas often renewed), of which the town and borough of Watchett was part and parcel; and whereas the harbour being of service to ships in distress, and there not being suf cient means to keep up the pier and harbour, &c., it was enacted that the pier and harbour should be vested in the lords of the manor as trastees for 21 years, &c., for the purposes therein men tioned, inter acla to levy certain duties to be applied in keeping up the pier and harbour. The 10th of Anne recited the aforesaid act, and extended the right to collect duties; the 7th of George L also recited both the former acts, and granted a further term; and the 10th of George IIL recited what had been done under the former acts, and that Sir Wiliam Wyndhmn and the Earls of Egremont, as lords of the manor of Watchett, had erected and kept uI
the pier at great expense from the inroads of the sea, which razed on that coast in a very extraordinary manner, and the act granted afurther term, andthe defendants'act authorized the granting of a lease by thelords of the manor of the pier and quay, or key. 'Under these circumstances the plaintifs clained to have the sole right to the pier, contending that the recitals in the foregoing acts proved their title distinctly, more particularly the defendants actwhichimplied that they had the legal estate. Before the defendants obtained their act one of the witnesses examined before the committee represented that the pier was never used by the inhabitants, who resorted to one of the slides to ship or unship goods, which was quite incensistent with the notion of its being a highway, and the effect of the defendants laying down raDls would be to render the posts and rings useless to vessels, whereby the dues and tolls to which the plaintiffs were entitled, and by which the pier was kept up, would be virtually lost. The evidence of Mr. Brunel and other persons who had been examined as to these points was read.
Mfr. GLASSE and Mr. RowCorTE opposed the motion, and ar'ued that whatever right the lords of the manor might ave had to the soil on which the pier and harbour were built previously to their erection, yet, when -once they had been built and dedicated to public prposes, the right of ownership was gone, and was now vested either in the Crown, in the Lords of the Admiralty, or in the plaintiffs as trustees for the public; and therefore either the latter or the Attorney-General were necessary parties, and some portion at least was below low watermark. An old document dated in the time of Queen Elizabeth showed that Sir John Wyndham possessed two weirs for fishing in the manor in the fresh and all the seaweed both by preseription; and as to the quay, the lords of the borough did never use to repair the ouay, neither were they charged with the building of it. Tihe evidence showed that the pier had always been used without any interiupton of the pubic right, was therefore * highway, and the company were not bound to purchase for the purpose of the easement. "Pinchin v. the London and Blackwall Railway Company (1 Key and John, 34-46). If it was a question of compensation, the Court would not interfere by injunction, as to damage to be done.
Mr. BRALY was heard in reply.
TheVicE-CH CELOP. referred to the facts indetail, and to the various documents and acts of Parliament which bore upon the question, and expressed his opinion to be that, without doubt, the plaintiffs, as deviseen in trust of Lord Egrempnt,were owners not only of the soll, but of the
itself, wbich was but upon the waste of the manor. Wte dedication to the use of the publicdid aot inany manner divest thea right of the lord of the manor, and that had been decided in two cae, one of " IAne v. Shephexd,
in 2 Strange's Reports, and the other in 1 Burrows. i On, the qgestion whether the pier was a highway, a highI way was, m common parlanoe, a road leading from one town
to another; but the teat was that some one ought to be under the obligation of keeping it in repair, of which
there was not a trc herem It wa also obvions that, there beIg a grenat nrell within-ths harbour o 2inly, cables wrere peessary to prevent injUry to vetsel, which were attached to ts,andabat bwas - paramnount rightto anm other, and if it was highway it 'would be cotatlyj

A11 that was asked by the plaintiffs was that proper steps might be taken by the
efendants legally to enter, and not to prevent their makDng a railway, but that they might take proper steps for that purpose, It was aso said that what was intended to be done would interfere with the use of the harbour, and therefore that the defendants might not interfere without putting matters in such a position a that the use of the pier and harbour might be retained intat The intention of the Legislature was that there should be a railwy, but the injunctionr must be granted so far as to prevent the defendants from proceeding, except in the regular nanner as they wouldinan ordinaur case, but not to restrain the mode of laying down rails, which there was nothin1 to show they would not do in a proper manner, after the necesgary legal steps had been taken.
RACR V. RACE.
This petition, which has been of late so often before the public, came on this morning after the conclusion of the former case.
Mr. E:llis appeared in support of the petition in this Cause, Mr. Haddan with him.
Mr. BAGSHAWx appeared for partes oppofing the petition, and asked that the petition should stand ov*r on the ground of incompleteness of evidence, and that a gnYemau had made an affidavit, stating that there was important matter which might be obtained from Ireland as evidence againt the mother. A demurrer for want of equity was also on the file, and under these c;rcamstances it was hoped that the Court would let the matter stand for the pirsent. It was not the practice of the Court to hear matters piece. zneal, the undertaldng being ready to be renewed. The child was placed in the custody of her mother by the order of the Court of Queen's Bench.
Mr. ELLIS said there was no reason why the case shou7d stand over. The fidavits should be withdrawn. What was asked was a referenceto chambers to appoint guardis, which was a matter of course. The mcother stated that she never was married before she married Eace, which wa3 denied, bat that was not to be used for this purpose. The infantwas constituted a ward of Court by the fact of the suit being pendig. It was also asked to restrain the mother fom taklng the child out oS the jurisdiction, which ws aDso a matter of course.
The VICzC&cx.nLLo. said that the Court had fhul pwer on argamentto appoint a guardian. The jurisdiction was perfect, although it might be necessary to have further inquiry. The Court would not allow the withdrawal of materialaffidavits in the case of an infant. Those now sought to be withdrawn were filed i: support of the petition.
Mr. ELLis said they were, but were not relative to the question of a mere reference to chambers, and therefore it
was a wlse dLscretion to avoid delay in the case of the infant, who was with her mother, on the religious question. It was ask-ed to restrain the mother specially from doing anything to instil into her daughter's mind any other principles than those of the church of England. At all events, it was most injurious that delay should take place. It was admitted that the infant was taken to the Roman Catholi chapel twice on each Sunday.
Air. BAGSuAwg denied that it was a matter of course to grant a reference This case opened * grave question, whether there was a guardian, and there must be a foundation laid on the whole of the evidence. The Court hadnothing to do with religious questions. There was nothing against this lady,except that she was a&Roman Catholic,and she had been pronounced by the Lord Chief Jastice as a most respectable person; and on behalf of the Roman Catholics he begged to say that there was nothing to support the application as a matter of course.
The VIOE-CuAlicILtOn said that, without expressing any opinion on the case of an infant, it ought to be considered that not only permanently, but temporarily, it was expedient that something should be done, and therefore he would hear the case to see what ought to be done instanter, upon the evidence.
Mr. Er.as said, that the infant plaintiff was the daughter of Lauman Mace, who was married on the 26th of September, 1844, at Chatham, ofwhich the certificate was produced, to AliciaRiley, of full age, widow, residing in Chatham, daughter of Thomas Rilev, labourer. The plaintiff was boin about July, 1846, and baptized at the parish church at Cbatham on the 2d of August, 1846, herfather being a private of Marines. She had an elder brother, John, the time of whose birth was not material, and it was stated by the mother that he was baptized by a Roman Catholic priest at chal, Lauman Race lived at Chathai from 184
till 1853, with occasional absences for recruiting, when he saed, on the occasion of the late war. While at Chatham hs brought up both children as Protestants, and sent them to the Protestant regimental schools there, and the plaintiff to the Church Sunday schooL They were left under the mother's castody3 and during that time were tiaen by her toBallyconnel, in Ireland. On the 24th of August, 1855
Launman Race made his will, and thereby, stating himself to be Sergeant of Royal Marines, gave to his wife all pay, half-pay, &c., subject to debts; desired that his Bible should be sent to his wife, and constitated her executrix of his will, irn full confidence that she would do juastice to his children as a wife and mother. On the 25th of August,
1854, lauman Race, when on the point of going into the action in which he fell, wrote to his wife and children, saying that he wrote afew lines before going into action; when they received it he should be no more, and if he shoald fall in defence of his Queen and country he expressed a wish that his wife should remain a widow to talke care of his children; he should be happy to hear from her, but God's will be done; that he was ill prepared to meet his laker, and bade her tell the children that his last thoughts were for them, and hoped that she would bring them up in the fear of the Lord, and sent his dying love to aU his relations, as they were going into Petropaulovski. He was kllWed in battle on theS or 4th of September; the defendant heard of his death either in December or January following, and made application to Captain Conolly, under whom her husband had served, to be relievedout of the Patriotic Fund, She left Ballyoomnel, as it appeared, about January, 1855, and went to Little Stonham, an Suffolk, and lived there with her husband's mother, and remained there for eight months, until the boy was put to school at Chardstock, in Dorsetshire, and the daughter to n orphan school at Hampstead, called the Sailors' Orphan Gir' School and Hom. While at Little Stonham the children were brought up as Protesants, went to church anda Protestant school; and the schools at Chardstock and Hampstead were both of Church of England principles. The mother then resided at Hampstead. Up to October last the mother never expresaed any disapprobation of the mode in which this infant was brought up, the first expression of some dissatisfaction being in a letter to Captain
isabooarne, on the 14th of that month, when she spoke of her son as delicate, and of going to see him, and baing dissatisfied with his management; and on the 23d of the same month, in a letter to the same peraon, she referred to the infant daughter, sayimg she had removed the boy by consent of Captain Fishbonrne, and was sorry to say that she wished for her girl also, although she had nothing to say against the school, but the gentleman (the clergyman of her chapel) snad he could not get a school for one without the other ; she had always gone to the Catholic Chapel, and had brought them up in the same way. The mother, after some strong letters, claiming that she had a right to do as she pleased, had an interview with the ladies' coLuneittee at the Orphan School, and it was represented by the chaplain, Mr. Bickersteth, to the plaintiff, by reading a written paper, that her mother wished her to be removed from the school, aud that they -wished to know her own wishes on the sub.ect, the authorities of the school not wishing to influence her, and trasted that she would act according to her con. victions, and asked her whether of her own free will she would go or remain. As to the qrestion whethershe would go with her mother the infant answered " No ;" and to the secondd, whether she would remain, she as distinctly answered " Yes."
A correspondence on the subject of the education of the children was then read, by whichit appeared thatthe grandmother considered that her son, the infant's father, wou'd have been most unwMillng that his children aheuld be brought up in the idolatrous worship of the RomAn Catholics. The brother of Iauman Race wished that the children should be brought up as Protestants. What his brother's wishes were he did not know.
The VIcE-Cn_tmNCLLoR said that it was the most sensible letter he had heard.
Mr. ELLIs resumed-On the 23d of December a writ of holaeas corpus was applied for to Mr. Justice Coleridge, but the matter was not argued till the 17th of January, and on the 20th this bill was filed; and on the 21st Lord Campbell delivered his judgment (reported in the Weea,y .cporeer for the 24th of January, p. 222), and which is familiar to the public, and by which it was decided that the mother was guardian by nurture and not by testament, and the jurisdiction was distinct at common law; and an order was made for delivery of the child to the mother.
Affidavits were then read in support of the petition, speaking to the above circumstances, and by which it appeared (inter alia) that 211. had been invested in the name of the infant and a trustee for ber.
The VicE-CnAscxLLoR said he supposed that was to found the jurisdiction.
Counsel resumed.-It was proved in the proceedings at comumon law that the mother said "It went to her heart to remove her daughter, but her clergyman would not take her boy without the girl." An afFidavit waas read which spoke of discussions between the plaintiff and her mother as to her knowledge of the distinctaons between the two falihs, which were in the child's handwriting. There were ah affidavits peaking to the child's wishes as to remnaining at school, also expressed in writing by the child, to the effect that she loved her mother very much, bet loved Jesus mor ad vould.not go tothe lRomn Catholio school, nor bow down; that she was asked by the priest whether ash would like to go to the Roman Catholie school, bu s erpreesed lor wish not to do so; There 'wae also et cc coqu irming the child'sanaere. tor.

Mtr. BAOSHAWE Eaid that the tencts of the Roman Catbolic Church were that every one oughn to go to church and teke their chlldret writh thtm, if possible. Themother was iu bad health, and no undtrtaki,,g could be given, estendingtothte nut goingto church, but =undertalng would at nce be given that the child should net be inter ered with by ibe mother, or any otber person.
It was thsn arranged tist his Donour should see the child to learn her own views, on the undes6tandbug that if the child wished to go to the Roman Catholic thurcb she should do so ; if not, that sho should be ordered by the Court not to do so, and that in tho meantime the cbild should be allowed to say such prayers as she should think fit, the motber undertaking not to speak or conmnwuncate to the child, nor allow any one else to do so, on religious subjects, nor to suggest any partioular prayer or prayers; continue the former undertaking, and let the case stand over till Monday week.
On returning into court
IliS HONOUR said that he had seen the child, and he took care to let her understand that the only question was her own persona wish whether she should or should not go to a2 Roman Catholio church either to-norrow and the next Sunday, and abstained frozn all other questions. The child was a shy and retiring child, and stated her wi,h not to go to a Roman Catbolio church, but to Christ Church, Hampstead; but he put the question again to her with the same result. In accordance tberefore with the aundertaking, there 'would be the probhibition, and he took pains to impress the moother with the nature ot the prohibition. Tbemother was anxious to have the child, naturally, and the ohild wras anxious to be with her mother.

in this case a rule had been granted calling on the Chief Commiisioner of the Insolvent Court to show cause why a
mandamus should not issue coimmanding him to order pay- I ment of the surplus estate of an insolvent named George Wiliam Dyson to one gobert Cook, the prowecutor of the writ. Dyson having become insolvent it appeared that he had executed a deed by which he had assigned
aU his property to Cook. Asignees being appointed,.. and the estate of the insolvent admiinistered for the payiment of the creditors, who were all paid in full, Cook, the assignee nuder the deed, claimed to have the sur-
of the insolvent's estate paid over to him. In the mean time Dyson had again become insolvent, and the new assig. nees put in their claim to the property. The chief commissioner, nuder these circumstances, examined into the validity of the deed on which Cook rested his claim; and, being of opinion that it was tainted with fraud, and that no suffcient consideration had been paid for its execution, he refused to make the order. Be delivered an elaborate jadgment, in which he stated fally the grounds of his decision. A rule was subsequently granted for a mandanw to the commissioner to pay over the surplus to the claimant, on the suggestion that, under the 92d section of the Ir,solvent Act, the duty of the chief commissioner was imperative to order the surplus to be vetted in the claimant.
Mr. BOVILL, Q.C., and Mr. J. CLtiic noiw showed cause against the rule, and contended that, under the statute, the commissioner was caed upon to disebarge a judicial duty; and that, as he had decided that the deed was fraudulent, this Court could not compel him to vest the property in the claimant, especially as none of the parties interested had been brought before the Court.
Sir F. THESIGFaXs Mr. «L S.An , Q.C., Mr. GILL of (the Chancery bar), and. Mr. Lusu appeared in support of the rule. The execution of the deed was proved in the Insolvent Court; and that being the case the commissioner's only duty was to order the surplus estate of the insolvent to be vested in tho clamant.
Lord CA3rsPELL said this rule was granted on the as. surance that the duty of the jud e was purely ministerial
but the counsel had failed to show that it was so. The first daty of the judge was to divide the property of the in-
eolvent among the creditors; and if there was any residue i he was required by the 92d section of the act to vest " the same in the person whose debts shall have been so discharged and satisfied, and his heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns." The Insolvent Court, in executing that power, must find out who were the insolvent's " heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns." If the claimant was assgnee, the judge must see whether be was really assignee and entitled to the property. It was admitted that if there was an allegation that the deed was forged that forgery must be inquired into; and that if two deeds had been executed by the insolvent tbe judge must inquire which deed was executed first. That showed that the judge had a general duty to inquire whether the party who claimed to be assignee really bore that character. He (Lord Campbell) was of opinion that the duty of the judge was not merely ministerial, but that he had an implied power to ascertain whether the claintant was an assignee pointed out by the act of Parliament. His Lordship said he was glad to find that thee was no conllict between his opinion and that of the Lord Chanicellor, for the prohibition granted by the latter had left to the judge of the Insolvent Court to do what he had done-viz., to see whateffect ought to be Xi ven to the deed. The judge had said that no effect ought to be given to it, because it was fraudulent, and this Couit had no authoity to interfere with his decision.
Mr. Justie COLEEIDGE, Mr. Justice WiGeT}rT, and Mr. Justice CRomnorN expressed themselves to the same effect.
Lord CAMAPBELL said the ruloe ust be discharged, und with costs.
RiE XDIG, AN ATTORNEY.
This was a rule to re-admit an attorney who had been struck off the roll of this Court in the year 1845, a consequence of a convictionr of a conspiracy to defraud.
Mr. J. Wilde, Q.C., and Mr. H. J. Hodgson, on the part of the Incorporated Law Society, showed cause against the rule,; Mr. AL Chambers, Q.C., and Mr. Prentice appeared in its support. wspoedm
While the argutuent was proceeding
lord CAPsnNLr.L said the most satisfactory course of dealing with the case would be that the affidavits on both sides should be referred. to the Baster, who should examine into te facts, and report thereon to the Conr.
Mr. iDALYsutS at first objected to tis course, as the Court had only heard one side, and he apprehended tbat camrne statementsinjurious to his client might bemade puolic, which he felt confidenst wero fully answered by his
dbtst.ately the sttggestion made by the Court was adopted, and the a davits were referred to one of the bSasters of the Court. e
RE .IO5ETf BERRY PUlLLER, AN ATrOii5mr
wr. apphnsDLisStOa moved forma rule to re-admit an at
torney named Joseph Berry Fuller, who had boeen struck off the roU of this Court in the year 185S for misconducb in coming to an agreement with a man who kept a barber's shop to carry on business together for the recover of amall d1ebts. When the nmatter was before the Court in 1853, their Lordahips were about to sentence a tr. Fuller to imprisonment fior three months, but at the request of the attorney
rmself, who was suffering fromn a disease of thenheast, and was apprehensive that imprisonment might cause his death, the Court conmuted the sentence of three months' imCri-
lonment, and ordered him to be struck off the roll. The applcant ni his affidvit now stated that, from; his coufpa
sion and excitement at the time, he omitted to ask the Cour thIocomuote the imprisonment for suspensions and after expressing great contrition for his offence, and promising good conuct efor the nture, he implored the Court to allow him to be re-admitted.
Mr. Am}nEu;Or, Q.C., said he was instructed, on the part of the Incorporated Law Society, to show cause againstth
rule in the first instance. The learned counsel contended tbat, according to the 324 section of the statute (the 6th and 7th Victoria, cap. 73) an attorney who allowed an unqualified person to practise in his name was liable to be struck off the roll, and was for ever after disabled from practising as an attorney or solicitor.
Lord CA,IPBILL said the agreement which the attorney
had entered into was a most culpable one, and if such an I offence were brought before the Court the Court would suspend the party for a long period. The party had agreed to give the other a share of his profits, but, though that was a great ofence, it was not the specific offence mentioned in the enactment. On the whole, considering his repentance and the promises the attorney bad made of unsullied conduct for the future, the Court thought he might be restored.
The other judges concurred. Itule absolute to re-admit.

THE QUEEN V. BENGOUGH.
Mr. POWELL applied for a rule for a quo wrranto calling on Thomas Bengou-h to show by what right he claimed to be retained on the burgess roll of the borough of Hereford. It appeared from the affidavits that previous to the passing of the Small Tenements Act (13th and 14th Victoria, cap. 99) it had been the custom in that borough for the owners of small houses to compound for all rates assessed on them. After the act came into force a vestry was held, and it was resolved that all tenements the owners of which were not then compounding should be charged under the provisions of the act. Thomas Bengough, against wrom this application was made, occupied a cottage in Ross-road, vine 6 l. 10s., whichhad been compounded for before the passiDg of the act. At the last revision he claimed to be placed on the burgess roll- his name did not appear ia the ratebook, but that of the owner of the cottage was inserted in the occupier's column. The Mayor and assessors, after discussion, admitted his claim. There were anumberof other persons in the same position, and the object of this application ws to have the opinion of the Court on their right before the nexst revision.
Mr. Justice ERLEn was not aware of any case in which a ouo warranto had been granted where the party objected to had not claimed to exercise any right as a burgess, but if the parties were only anxious to have a decision on the point of law he felt disposedto gant a rale.

Mr. PULLING applied on behalf of a Mr. Willuams for an order directing the Master of the Court to receive and enroll bis articles of clerkship; the articles had been executed in August, but when they were tendered to the Masterfor enrolmentherefused toreceive them, as they had not been stamped. The applicant contended that the Mfaster had no discretion, but was bound to receive tbem whern tendered; the law alLowed him eix mouthsto hasve themstained, and the duty was a matter between bim and the Treasu`rq
Mr. Justice ERLE was afraid that if he granted this application it would become a practice not to have the articles *tamped until the conclusion. of the clerkship; a paty would get his articles enrolled and refrain from paying the duty on the chance of changing his intention, so that if he did not eventually apply for assion he need never pay *,he daty.
Mitr. PUr,rG said that evil could not arise, for it was discretionary with the Treasury to allow the articles to'be stanmped, and a party would aot expose himself to the risk of a refusal.

Mr. HAWK1NS moved for a certiorari to bring up an order made at the sessions for the borough of Cambridge on the 5th of January, on am appeal by the Cambridge Waterworks Board against a rate for the relief of the poor of the Crambridge Union. On the appeal the valuation of the waterworks had been reduced to a nominal sum, and the guardians sought to quash the order, on. the ground, aaong others, that the Deputy Recorder, by wliom it was nade, was a shareholder in the company.

MIr. E. JASMES said that in this case he had obtained a rule callng on Colonel Sleigh to show cause why the plaintiff shoald not be at lberty to issue execution against him for 9001., notwithstanding an order of protection. He understood Mr. Serjeant Ballantine was in attendance to show cause, but before doing so he (Mr. James) had to apply for leave to Mile additional affidavits in answer to one filed by the defendant. The action was brought to recover damages for a false representation as to the value of a newspaper called the B)ritih Amy Despatch which Colonel le ogh had sold to Maor Walker, the plaintiffiAWhen the cause came on for trial a settlement was agreed to, on the terms that the plaintiff's costs should be taxed and paid forthwith; that the damages should be taken at 0g., to be paid, 2501. on the 15th of January, 1857, and 2501. on the 1st of March; if any default in the pam ent of coets or damages, the plaintiff to be at liberty to issue execution for 900. The defendant also gave an undertaking that he would not execute a bill of ae, or do anythmg to prejudice the plaintiff's remedy against him. The first instalment was not paid, and Colonel Sleigh was arrested, but at once gave notice to the sheriff's officer that
he had received a protection frorm the Court of Bankruptcy,' and obtained his, L"harge. The plaintiff then moved for the p resent rule. In answer to it Colonel Sleigh had put in a long affidavit, entering at great length into all the tran,sactions between Major Walker and himself.

1]? THE MATTER OF )IOLT, AS ARTICLED C01p1K.
Mr. IIODGSOK appearedto show cause against waule calling on the examiners of the Court to proceed with the ex ammiation of Mr. aames John Bolt ; the examiners had no wish toopos Mr. Bolt, but vxder the circumstances of the case they did not think it right to act without having the facts brought before the Court. There vas no quesSion that Mr. Bolt had duly served mderhis articles, anD he had given the requisite notices for the last examination, but on the 17th of January he received An intimation be would not be permitted to p resent himself, as it had been die. covered that in 1842 he had been found guilty on an indictrment for conspiracy. Ii supprt of this rule he had made an affidavit, in whichhie detailed the whole transation. Re stated that in 1842 he was under articles to Mr. Spiler ,who was instructed by a person named Gordon to issue a writ against a Mr. Efevers. After the writ was issued Gordon said he wished to bave it served by a man of his own, and obtained possession of it for that purpose. The defendant did not appear, and on Gordon's statemnent that the writ had been served an appearance was entered for him under the statute.. Gordon also undertook to serve the notice of declaration. The defendant did not plead, so judgment was marked and damages assessed on a writ of in qugry. Bevers was then arrested on a easa., but at once appled tob8discharged,andtosetaside the whole proceedings, on the groundthat he haduever been erved with the wit of notice. EIe soon after, without any preinmiry investigahion by a ragistrate, preferred an indictmentbefore tliegand ury aains SplerHolt, Gordon, and another man, for a conuspgiracy. Mr. Bolt stated in his affidavit that aftr te bllswer fondhe received an intimation frora the prosecutor that no evidence would be offered against him or h isnaster, and thereforemade no preparations for

Judgment bad never been entered against him, and he swore roost positively that he was entirely innocent of the offence with which he had been charged. A number of other affidavits had been filed, giving him the highest character.
i. E. JASIMS, in support of the rule, was not called on.
Mr. Justice ERLE said that a person who had been guilty of the offence charged against Mr. Bolt was certainy not fit to be admitted an attorney, but the fact that no judgmaentbhad been entered against him was a point in that gentleman'ls favour anborboae is statemnent. HBe

ur. nA'WRITNS showed cause against a rule to rescind an order of Mr. Baron Bramwell for the arrest of the defendant and to discharge him from such arrest, the order having been made on the groundathat the defendant was about to qit England. In his affidavit, on which this rule was obtained, the defendant swore that on his arrival in Enghnd from the Cape he was taken into eustody onx a charge of forgery, and brought before the Lord lfMayor, who, after many remnands, discharged him; that he was then arrested at the suit of a creditor, on the ground that he was about to quit England, and detained on three otber actions, includiag that of the present plaintiff; and that Justices Willes, Coleridge, ac d Crompton had discharged him from thoeo detainire on applications similar to the present one.

The declaation in this case stated that the defendant had wrongfully taken away and converted to his own use certain articles ad nmoney, the proerty of the plaintiff as admninistratrix of the 'will of oue ry Wootten. The defendant pleaded that he did not carry away the goods and m;oney; not guilty to the conversion of the goods; aud that the goods and raoney were not the property of the plaintiff
Mr. Collier and Mr. Beasley appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr.- Serjeant Parry for the den t.
It appeared from the plaintiff' case that she was the
mother of Mary Wootten, the testatrix, who died in Audi I of last year. In her will she left nearly everg ugto bher two unniarried sisters, and only a. Bible to her brother, the defendant. Immediately alter her death the defendant who was the head constable at Cheshire, seized everything she possessed, which were of sonme value, as sheh been for some years lady'g-maidato IAdy Malcolm. After considerm. ble diffioulty sorne portions of the poerty w ere tveto the plaintiff, who had administered to the wilL Hle still retained a jewelcase containing jewels to the amount of about 241., besides other articles worth about 61. The actionL was brought to recover either the articles themselves or else their equivaleht in value. -The defendant had, in addition to those articles taken 17l in money from the lodgings of the deceased, 'which was also sought to be rerovered.
Witnesses were called to supporb the plaintiffs case
The defence was that the deoeased had earnestly desired the defendant to see her wishes carried out as expressed in ber will, and she had at tbe same time given him the jewel , stating that she knew he would take care of them, where
if they got into her mother's hands, they would be in the pawnshop before the night was out, He had taken possession of his sister's property in order to fulfil the terms of the will, but he had kept everything intict, and, with the exception of the jewelcese and a few other articles of no value given to his wife, everything had been returned to the Elaintiff for the use of his unmarried sLster. Wit.h the 17'
h had paid tbhe funeral and many other expensee.
Several witnesses were called to support the defendant's | view of the case.
During the examination of the defendant as to his having removed the articles in question from the deceased's lodgings,
Mr. Baron WATSO.N said to him, "Itisluckyfor you that you are not in another court."
Mr. Serijant PAXRY, in sumning up the defendant's evidence, made some strong observations upon his Lordship's remark. Mis client was a respectable man in position, and nothing had ever been said against his character. He gave a good reason for his taking possession of the deceased's pro. perty, and if his Lordship's observation was acted upon by the jury they must find five respectable and disinterested persons guilty of the raost deliberate and wilful perjury.
Mr. CoLaisn having replied upon the whole case,
Mr. Baron WATsoN, in sunming up, said that this was the miost miserable case he had ever heard for which ever of the parties won both must be ruined. khe plaintiff as administratrix, was entitled to have had al the personZ property of the deceased placed in her hands for distri. btionV OThe jury mstM say whether they gave credenice to the defendant as to the gift of thhe jewels to himn by the deceased.

THE QUXE V. GFBRET.
MIr. Justice CRESSWSLL said this case had been sent by the session at Pxeston. This was an indictment sai st the defendant, as a servant, for stealing, not embezzlng. The evidence was set out and was very long. It appeared that the learned chairman left several questions to the jury, and. he said the jury had found a verdict of guilty, and he was sentenced to four years' penal servitude. The chairman requested to know whether the prisoner bad been properly convicted. Of course, he meant to ask whether the evidence would warrant the verdict of giuty. There was abundant evidence of embezzlement, but not of stealing; and althougb, under a clause in a recent act of Parliament a person convicted of stealin ght be convifteiof emn bezzlement, yet he could not be convicted of stealng be. cause there was evidence of embezzlement. The conviction must tberefore be reversed.
Conuvction reversed.
THE QUEENr V. s PZE.
Mr. Justice ERLE delivered judgment in this case. The Court were of opinion that the conviction ought to be affirmedL The defendant was wrongfuly in the burial. ground, and had wrongfuly taken away several corpses, and e had done so by trespass, for the licanse he had obtained was not given or intended for that par-
osDe, and whereas as for that purposqe there was no lcense the evidence proved the miasdenieaiour, unless there was adefence. Although the Court were fully sensible of the estmable motives upon which the defendant had acted, which were full of affection and belief of religious duty still there was no authority which would justify the removal, altbough the motive deserved approbation. Nor did our law recognize the right of any one child to the corpse of the parent. The protection of the grave depended upon this form of indictment. There was no authority for sawing that anything coald justify the taking a corpse from the grave. Although im confirming the convichon they had every respect for the motives of the defendant, they th ought it better to lay down the general rule. The conviction therefore would stand; but be was able to say that the sentence would be a merely nomninal one-a fine of Is.

The assignees requested the bankrupt to give an account of goods bought and sold during the last siL months bbfore the bankrnptcy. He did so. The' purobases amounted to 14,3621. These goods were, or are, said to have been, immeoiately consigned to Alexandra Constantinople, $myrna, Brussels, Antwerp, Hamburg, and Balalkaia. The bankrupt dealt largely in bills of exchange; 5,50001. of bhlls receivable are abown to have passed through his hands by his bill book, and I suspect these are not by any rueans alL Ile accounts in his biU receivable account in the ledger for but f Ol,0 . 5ost of the persons to whom g

This was an adjoun ed examination meeting. Xr.' EtVor aph eared for the ssignees, and Mr. lawrance for
Mr. Sftom called attention to the figures in the balanceE-sheet. Xotwithstanding the facts they disclosed the bankrupt gave orders in karch and April last for iron, sugar, and other goods to the amount of several thousand pounds. Some of these orders were unortunately execated. n one case the banlrptpld obtained 6181. worth of sugar on the 18th of April,.aud.on the 6th he viedged the warrants. Ie had stated that he wenttoarE3burg on the 24th of April and returned on the, l8th of May, his object being to get assistance from his friends - but the asignees believed that he only went away to enaIle those who were acting in concert with huim to carry out their views. The bankrupthad urchasfd goodsthroughhisagent, Mr. Stein-. bergh, and llowed Sttiiberg' a commission. Mr. Vincent Deportu, with wvhom the barokcrpthad been connected, had denied all knowledge of transactions recorded in the bankrnpts books respect t hmself.
*Mr.BRnwim sad, he Jpered for Mr V. Deportu, who did not unde=and ngI,s4 ve` welland he was instructed that he had not righty' erstood. the questions and answers on the ocesionot his zecent examination, He could now be eumined tg means of an inte retor.
Mr. STOP± BsS.-Whe&tankrn,pt himself thiree ears ago, he ad his examination without the aid of an inteipreter.
The bankrupt examined1 said, he commenced business in Augnst, 1853, in Itark-lane. Thazt -wa in the office of ir. Vincent Deportu. De6iorti was a bankrupt it the tihe. He (banlrapt) conmmenbed *ith a capial of SOl. or 601. Before he commenced busineis he had bills of lading, and he commenced as a commission agent. Carried on business in MArk-lane five or six weeks. Then removed to Jeffey-square and W continued there up -to the bankruptcy. Had always traded as Anton Leo and Ce. Had been uothing at allt before he commenced biLsiness. Was lookhng ot tfop a situation w,hen Deportu recommended bim to commnenoe buiness. Hte was to pay De-
rtu 2^ per cent. conission uon txansactions. Mr. la Lorme kept his bools. Mr. Mller and Mr. Arnold had also kept his books. De Lorme was clerk to Deportu, and he (Do Lormea 'had been bankrupt more than once. There eeM entries in his books to the debit of Vincen' Deprtu.' Tfiese morieys were for payments for commission. Vincent Deporti was a cousin of one Braggiott; and he hasd receEved the bills mentioned in his books from Braggiotti Brothers.
Mr. IAWn.lSCs 'said there were Vincent Deportu, sen., and Vincent Deportui jun. There was also John Deports. It 'as desirable that no mistake should be mnade.
The bankrupt in continuation aaid,-Vinceit Deportu, sen., was not his debtr. The Mr. Arnold reered o was now at Mr. De Courof4 1, St. Mary-axe. Mr. V. Deportu was not a debtor, be"ause he had omitted to credit him with several sums. He had not written to Air. Vincent Deportu informing hira that he had transferred to him several accounts.
Mr. Deportu was here equested to leave the court, whioh having done the bankrupt's examination was continued.- There was no entry in his books of any single sum of money received from Mr. V. Dlepotu. He had received bills from him to take up bills draw' upon him (bankrupt) from Smyrna. Could not trace any of these bills. Deportu gave him money to take up biUs at the beginning ,of .T855. when his son (V. Deportu, j,umn. e over. Could riot say how much ; should not ik- tao take his oath as to that-could only say the time.
After some further 'examination, which went to show that the bankrupt wa incapable of explaining his accounts,
Mxr. LAIiRAwCz surbmitted that the bankrnpt-a- very youn mn- had been 'the dupe and tool of persons older
The CoxMM ssmNR sad, it was quite clear that he had been a tool; but whether he had been a guilty or an innocent tool remained to be shown.
-Mr. hLAWvneCASS aid,lt WaS muAch to be regretted that the boos Ahad been kept in such a manner that the bankrupt was inca,pable of explaining them. It could not be denied that such a course was inconv^enient.
Thea CoSh issro r b , is worse thman inconxvenient; it *Mr. GRj1L?A (official assignee) expressed his belief that another party was the principal mover of the strings.
'The ComLssnioN&xR said,it was quite cear that the bank. rupt'sexamuiation must be adjourned sine die. The only question was whether he should receive protection. There were all sorts of errors, crosses, and erasures in the books, and it would be a farce to think of passing the bankrupt on such accunts.
Mr. LA.&vRAsjc would admit that the bankrupt could not pass; but why not examine DeLorme, who kept the books?
Mr. STOPYM R. -He has been examined, but we could get nothing froma bin.
The bankrupt in reily to questions respecting parties with whom henad ha transacifons, said he could not say whether G. S. Giras had failed or not; was not aware that he had failed. Foscolo (of London) had failed. Could not say whether Braggiotti Brothers had failed-was not aware. Paul Testa hadleft. One Braggiotti had failed. Testa was a partner in the house of Braggiotti. A. E. Guidici was bankrupt. Navone was not bankrpt. Barker and Black were not bankrupts. Spitzer was 1bahar- ,pt. oh yes; he was in the Queen's Bench prison." Mlward liddleton, and Co. were bankrupts; they had failed months ago.
Mr. STOPmrRx submitted that entries in the bankupVs books in the name of Vincent Deportu were a fiction, and that protection must be refused for keeping fse books
The bankrupt, on further examination, said he had accepted bills for'a Mfr. Boyer of Paris. Thought he had received them from Gindici. He had aceepted biUs for other persons without knowing who the dravwers were. Had 'accepted bills to the amount of 2,0001. or 3,0001. for De Courcy. De Courcy had no oftice of his own until this bankruptoy, but 'was in his (bankrupt's) office every day -before for some time vast. De Courcy introduced him to his (De Courcy's) friends, to whom lie might consign goods. DeCourey was his manager, and. he paid binim301. a-mionth. De Courcy is a creditoz for a small aiim 3
By MIr. L&W oax -De Couroy introduced him to the persons who took consgnments, and they kept the proceeds of course. (LaughteF,)
Vincent Deportu, sen., was next examined.-It appeared from his examinationthatb helid been for some time pastrosiding in a boarding-house in Russell-square and Woburnplace. He had been bankrupt a'bout three or four vears ago as a commission agent in Mark-lane, and had known tke bankrupt about 2i years or more, Knew him at the time of his bankruptcy. Tho bankrupt had consigned goods to his son, John Deportu, from whom he (the father) received a salary of 2001. a-year. Some of the articles dealt in were sponges.
lMr. BREWxn said, there was a special business in this aticle of sponge. (A laugh.)
3r. Deportu, in continuation, said, he had not received the sums specified in the bankrupt's books. It was his son, John Depottu, who had received the money. An entry respecting a bill of exchange for 1501., and another of 2001., he 6knw nothing of; nor did he know anything about such bills. The bankrup's accounts nmixed up his name with bis son's. He thought he was a editor for VSI or so.
By Mr. LwnvM'cx.-The bankrupt had consigned goods to Constantinople and Smyrna through his son, John Deportu, who -was now in Srayrna.
Mr. SroPnmm sabmitted that the bankrupt having in bis balanee-sbeet returned incent Deportu, sen., as a creditor for 641., to enable him to prove against his estate for that amount was a falsification of accounts that. called for a refusal of protection.
The Co Nrsox thought it was a CaSe of suspicion, but that the charge had not been sufficiently sustaied to warrant the refusal of protection. The bankrupt had had dealigs with J'ohn Deporto, and the amount maight perhaps be dueto him.
Mr. STOuRm u vged the circumstances of the cas.

The prosecutor, who was mnuch affected, stated,-I am reall very sorry, Sir, to prosecute this lad but I caninot help it. e hsawaysbeena great trouble to hisPOOr3omther; indeed, she is almost brokenhearted about him, aLnd has had severe illnes'ses in consequence, I ami grieved to say that he has Always eshibitecl a bad, destructive disposition, and as proofs of it, 'I may menotion that on one occasion hel robbed his mother, And on another a relative, and for the latter offence, it being considered to he for the boy's own benefit, he was prosecuted, and sent for two months to the Houseof Correction, I believe by M1r. Yardley, of the Thames P'olice.' He has also been three times in a Reformatory Home in the East, but the last time he was there he robbed the institution. I then tried to get him into the Red-hill 'Reformatory, and Mr. Yardley endorsed may efforts, but uselessly, as the place was full, and I therefore, as a last resource, got him on board' the Buccleuch, for the East ,Indies, and he returned from the Cape on the 2d of this month (Janiuary), the captain being gla to get rid. of him, as he ha stoleni the ship's stors to a considerable amount' and digsposd of them to the sailors. When he presented himsei aglain atmiy house I believed hemiust have reformed, and took to him withouLt hesitation, but you wil see I had soon cause to re rt it. The night before this last robbery 'tookp late (on e 16th) I accdentally mnentioned to myV wife that I had received three 5?.-nates from the company's paD,y-clerk, andI1 think the prisoner mnust have he I sue, fr, hvig placed the notes, a half-sovereign, and some

In the breakfast parlour I founid my: writingdesk broken open, and in the pr-isoner's bedroomlI discovered my trousers, but mny purse and knife were gone, though the bunch of keys was on the bed. The prisoner was not in the house, And, as he had evidently gone out by the area, the gate of which was openi, I went to the station to have him secured, and found from a constable that oni seeing him, when he left may house at 4 in the morning, he crossed boldly over to him And inquired the way to the docks, saying he had to join his ship, and, as he was dressed in sailor's clothes, ashe now is, the officerhad no suspicion, and directed him. NeitherXI3or th2epolice could hearanythiag of' him ti llesterday ening when I ran pIump against hima in Whiecapl and on. taking him to a cofteehouseand qestining im hesaidhe thught he plice

On Mionday evening, the 19th, I returned from market with a 51. note, which I gave to my wife to take upstairs. Presntly afterwards I happened to look throuh my window, and saw the

I1 aske whre e go thm fom, and he saidi he had just been paiofftth doks,and wanted to find his father and mnother, who lived i Bromley-street. I remarked oni his father and mother not coming tomreat him,and he complaiuefof their not doing so, " although," he said, "he had written to them while at the Cape, and also on reaching the Channel.' I wid it was a bulk of money for a lad like him
the risner,andI terefre fferd hm asovereign for im-
ediateuse, and usr,ged him to h unt this pAre tseas soon as he could. I directly after reollected where Bromley. street was, and sent one of my servants after him, but he returned without him, saying he had overtaken the lad near the. church, but that he had refused to come back. I immediately suspected the boy, took the numbers of the notes, and went to the polie-station and gave them xp
Davey, 265 N .-I received the notes, and nade inquiry for the boy. I went to Woolwich and various other places, and, bearng that he intended to visit bis shipmates, 6 also wentto leverpool afterhis, hut all toiio purpose.
Prosecutor-I have also something else to state, which is this, that on the 25th, the Sanday following this robbery,
he,actually broke into iy bouse and again endeavoured to zob, axs also a lodger. He ownedthat he had gtinat the first-floor window by the aid of some planks, which he
foxmed into a sort of ladder, lit a lamp in an ante-roomn, and,
crawled into my bedrooin, bat, .ot S ding bjig nortS able there, he went into the bedoom of r my gger, r. Fernyhouih, who awoke on his entrance, and the prisoner was therefore obliged to lie thre-quar of au hour umder hi bedstea till he went to sleepagain, wrhen, not fnding anything in the eshape of plunder, he committd the roseest a t of indecency in the gentlean's room, andI left brte sale wy le hadentee,as there was a dog f,astn ,p below, wzhich I had bought sinCe he robbed me~ ad absconded.
Mr. HAeMILL-I must say, Sir, you appear to have ied every available means to reform this boy, and the eowduct of Mr. Bannister is also very praiseworthy. The lodger alluded to must attend, as I l auredy send the risoner for trial both on the charge of robbery and that of burglary. It is a moet distressing case, but that ist"e only chance ofan ultimate service beiug rendered the prisoner, though it would certaim4y tax the ingenuity of any reform&*or to elimhm
T'he prisoner was then remanded for the depositions, not havng offered a single remark throughout, ubt on being placed in the cell he coolly said to Alderman, the gaoler, "Ah, you ay loki me up, if you like, but it wi not be for long."
COx-rwx-T .--Three men, who ave the nam eof Henry Hampdenm James Gower, and Daniel Stevens, known to the police as loafers and idlers, who atand about the publichouses near Islington-turnpike, were cbarged with etern bakers' shops intheneighbourhcodof Idingtor and Stoke Newington and demanding bread orthepIa t1atthy were out of work land, where they met with refs helpin themselves and ten dec mplg withthe profeeds of teii robbery. Inonecece,at Neuington,whereayoung woan. was alone in the shop, on her declining to give tbem anything, they were about to comimut a robbery by helning thvemseves, when she seized a lap knife used for divixdn
the loses, and threatened to cut the first man down'who laid a hand on the goods. The became alarmed at ber coune and made off, but the police were on their track, and the three prisoners were subsequetly captured with a quantity of bread in their oeeson.
They were identified as i lainug been committed }ireviouslz', two of them no less than three times, and were committed to prison. for one month each,
SOUTHWARL-Sixteen ablebodied paupers belons to Christchur=h workhouse, l} of whom were eo s4erthly under 40 years of age, were brought up in custody- car
with refusing to perform the work allotted them in return for their maitenance, and setting the parish authorities at dellance.
Mr. Blake, the clerk to the guardians, who was in attendau to smpport the complaints, informed his worsliip that two of the prisoners, who had lamge families suppored by the parish, cost 200D. a-year. The men and their wives were in the workhouse, and the children were at ilmool at Tooting, where each of theinoet the ?arish7s. weekly. Those two men, with the other 14 now mn the dock wlhen called upon on the previous day by the taskmaster to per-form their usua! daily labour in return for their spport refused to perform ih defying the authorities to compel them. The commotion caused in the workhoue by their conduct was so alarming that the -aster was compelled to call in the polce, and give thenm al into custody.
The fisoer here said that the weather was so cohld, and tefo oscanty, that it was imnpossible for them to nerfornm their work; ix fact,, they bad not strength enxougi to
Mr. Blake said, his worship could perceive that the whole of the prisoners were heart, ableboiied men, abd quite able to oths work required of them. As for the foodt it was wholesome, nd a great deal more plen than m of the ratepeyers were able to get Compaints had been made by the latter as to the paupes being anpplied with nieat threetimes a-week, whereas, with great

In consequence of those complaint a coMunicatren WAs made to tbe Poor lAw Board, and;sanother dietwy table *as snbstituWed for aWlebodied paupem Instead of having ineut three tmesa-we*k, they had it twioe, ana pudding in lieu of the third day' meat. They had soup otber das and supper after they- bad performed their days wrktbatwas aore tba'n'agmatay oftbe ratepaiershad.;
The prisomers again complained that the food was Inuicient, and that they could not do their work on it.
The Magistrate told them there was a certain quantity of work allotted to them to perforg by the Poor Iaw Bokd, and he had no power to interfere. They all seemed ablebodied, and motof them young men, and they ought toibe ashamed of being a burden to the pais However,ibe supposed they became destitute, and were, consequly, entitled to be relieved by the paish, but at the same tiae they were bound by law to do their work.
Mr. BLake here said the authorities had no wish to punish them, as most likely they had been misled. If they would return to their work he was willing to withdraw the charges.
The prisoners, in a noisy manner, declared that they would sooner be sent to prison than return to the workhouse to worlr on such food, They could not do it.
The Magistrate aid that, if such was the case, all e had to do was to pt the law in force. They mnust eachbe conmitted to the Houe of Correctionfor 14 days, wh bard labour.
Mr. Blake said ihe believed the prisoners had an idea that they would have better food in the prison than they lad in the workhouse.
Mr. Bdwin, the chief clerk, told them they were much mistaken, for during the 14 days they would only have bread and grel.
The prisoners, who seemed rather surprised a this information, were then sent to Wandsworth House of Correction.

It is reported that the 8th Royal Irish Hussars ane under 'rders to march from Dundalk to Dublin early in March. The 8th will probably relieve either the 2d or 3d Dragoon Guards, both preparing for service in India.
The followiing changes are to be made among the staff and medical officers at Chatham garrison:-SSecond-Clas Staff. Surgeon G. Hyde, M.D., to be attached to the Provisional Battalion; Second-Class Staff-Surgeon W. Poole, to be stationed at the invalid depot, St. Mary's Barracks; StaffAssistant-Surgeou R. W. Woolcombe, is ordered to be relieved from any further duty at Chatham for the purpose of proceeding to Plymouth, where he will be stationed; Acting-Assistant-Surgeoa H. W. Hubbard has received notice that there is no longer any occasion for his services.
The following officers have joined their respective regiments at the Provisional Battalion, Chatham, for the purpose of taking the command of the depots of their corps, viz. :-Brevet-Major J. R. Heaton, 37th Regiment, and Br-vet-Maior W. C. Mollan, 75th Regiment.
Her Majesty's steam frigate Sidon, 22, was taken into the steam basin at Portsmouth on Saturday to be refitted.
The Meg:era, 6, iron steam troopship, Commander Purvis, will embark about Wednesday next 150 of the 33d and 400 of the 85th for the Mauritius. These troops arrived in Portsmouth garrison on Thursday, and took up quarters at Haslar and Fort Monckton. The Megera will touch at the Cape of Good Hope, thus offering the first chance of forwarding letters, &c.
The Diadem, 36, experimental screw frigate, is being rapidly fitted with her 800-horse power engines, by Maudslay and Co. The Diadem, when launched, was prescribed an armamont of entirely 6S-pounders, except two pivot guns on the upper deck, which were to be 10-inch. This seems to have been changed for the following:-Main deck, 20 1G-inob, throwing hollow shot of S41b.; upper deck, 14 32-pounders of 45 cwt., and 9 feet long, and two 68-pounders. If this be correct, it will give a total fire of 2,2641b. (I ton 4 owt.), or a broadside at each discharge of 1,1321b. (12 cwt). We give below the principal features of the three most powerful ships of their respective classes in the British fleet, and of the late visitor to our southern ports from the United States,-the Merrimac,-by which it will be seen that the Diadem, although 1,400 tons less than the American frigate, will throw nearly as heavy a
1wn,,kAc *
Pierced for 60.
With the exception of the Duke of Wellington, the weight of the broadside is calculated on the assumption of the 8 and 10-inch guns firing hollow shot; of these the Shannon hass30 8-inch; the Diadem 20 10-inch; and the Merrima, 40. With all sold shot the Shannon would throw a broadside of 1,3291b.; this, however, it is said she is not intended to do, the 10-inch gun being designed for hollow shot.
The Royal Frederick sailing three-decker of 110 guns, built after the model of the Queen, and which has been on the stocks at Portsmouth for the last 20 years, 10 or more of which she has been ready for launching, has developed practically the experiment she has been kept. on the stocks to exhibit, viz.-whether ships would keep as sound out of the water as in it. An examination recently has shown that dry rot has been largely at work with the lower extremity of the ship, much of the keel, &c., being affected by it. It is now talked of lengthening her, and making her a 8team 130-ganship, but to do this the slip which she has so long tenanted and the shed over it must be lengthened to meet the improvement intended.
The Imperieuse, 51, screw frigate, Captain R. B. Watson, C.B., will be paid off at Portsmouth on or about Thursday next. It is reported that Captain Watson will be ne.xt appointed to relieve Commodore Trotter in command of the squadron on the Cape of Good Hope sta.ion.
On Sunday last five artiUlerynien put off from the Barbican, Plymouth, in a small boat, intending to visit some comrades at Bovisand battery, near the eastern entrance to the Sound. A thole having broken, and the wind being strong from the northward, they were driven into the Channel, where they passed the night, and on Monday, when near the Eddystone, were picked up by the outwardbound Prussian bark Michael, which placed them on board a pilotboat. They landed at Fowey, and returned to Plymouth the same day. Colonel Pester, commanding the Royal Artillery in the WVestern District, has addressed to M-. Lus,combe, the Prussian Consul, a letter of acknowledgment of the humanity of Captain Muler in rescuing the men, and of the kindness they received on board.
The screw corvette Pelorus, 21, sister ship to the Satellite, wiU be launched from the .Devonport dockyard on Thursday, and not onTuesday, aspreviously stated.

The Licensing System And The Billeting Of
TEF LICEN-SING SYSTEM AND THPE BILLETING O0
SOLDWERS.-LIVERPOOL, Jan. 31.-A deputation from the Liverpool licensed victuallers waited upon Mr. W. Brown, M.P., AIr. J. C. Ewart, M.P., and Mr. J. Bramley Moore, M.P., with reference to these objects, and each of those gentlemen expressed their disapproval of the proposed bill to throw open the trade of the licensed victaaller, anid asssured the deputation they would take an interest in both matters when brought before them.
REPRESENTATION oF DumFRiSaEssninc.-The friends of Lord Henry Scott, observing the very general feeling in favour of Mr. Eope Johnstone of Annandale, as expressed at public meetings of the electors on the 21st and 28th of January, have resolved to withdraw Lord Henry; and an intimation to this effect appears in a local paper of Friday. MIr. Hope Johnstone is therefore the only candidate for the representation of Damfriesshire, and it is almost certain that when the proper time arrives he will be elected as the successor of the Mtarquis of Queeusberry without opposition. The Earl of Dalkeith, eldest son of the Duke of Buccleucli, and brother of Lord Henry Scott, in writing to Mr. Lang (the chairman of the latter) on the subject, says-" It was, as you well know, only after Mr. Hope Johbstone had firmly declined the applications made to him to become a candidate to represent the county of Damfries that consent was given that my brother Henry, now absent from the country, should be brought forward as a candidate. I have seen by the report of what occurred at Dumfries on Wednesday last (the 21st inst.) that a requisition is te be presented to Mr. Hope Johnstone that he would come forward for the representation of the county of Dumfries. I must, therefore, on the part of my brother, request that his namne may be at once withdrawn as a candidate, so that Mr. Hope Johustone may be quite free to decide as he thinks fit." Both Lord Henry Scott aad Mr. Hope Johnstone belong to the Conservative party, but the latter gentleman is in favour of opening up the parochial schools of Scotland. so that all Protestant Dissenters as wedl as members of the established church, may be eligible as teachers in them. Mr. Johnstone, when formerly the representative of Damfriessliire, voted in behalf of the free trade measures of Sir Robert Peel. He may be looked upon as a "Progressive Conservative," and wvill probably on thar account not enlist under the banner of Mr. Disraeli when he takes his seat in the Houqe of Commons. Lord HEienry Scott, -who -was so near being M.P. for Damufriesshire, is understood to have inbibed the opinions of his father against opening up the parish schools, and to agree in other respects with the political views of the noble duke. He has doubtless been withdrawn from the desire of his grace to revent a contest occurring which would have divided the 'onservative party in Dumfriesshire.
HU-ImIANIrY AT SEA.-The French sloop L'Honorine, Captain Letoy, left Ranisgate on the 26th of January with 52 tons of iron for St. Main, and when 20 miles south of the Isle of Wight, from some unknown cause, probably the starting of a butt, went down in so sudden a manner that her crew, four in all, bad barely time to cut the punt's gripes and get in before she disappeared under them. This occurred at about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, when the wind was blowing very strong, and the sea running high. At 2 o'clock the next morning a brig under close-reefed topsails passed close to them, apparently without noticing their signals of distress. Hoowever, at 8 oeolock they saw her again three miles off ooming towards them, and at half-past 9 they were alongside, but by this time they had become so beaumbed with cold andhunger that they had not strength to get on board, and were hoisted in by ropes. The brig was the Amelie, from Dieppe, of and for N ewport. Mrr. Jenkins, her master, had observed the distressed boat at first, bat, having failed in his efforts to discover her again, determined snobt humanely to remain near. He fed and clad the unfortunate Frenchmen, took tbem into Plymouth Sound oe Friday, and the next day delivered them into the charge of Mr. John Luscombe, their consul. Captain Cenkins already possesses a gold medal presented by the French Government for humanely saving several lives on the Fresich coast.
THE E.&ST INDIA COMPAn Y.-A contemporary has announced that Sir Frederick Currie will Succeed to the Deputy-Chairmanship of the Court of Directors of the East India Couipany at the next election. We have much pleasure in cofirlming this report, as we feel sure that such a distinction could miOt be coniferred in a more worthy quarter. Sir Frederick Currio entered Haileybury in January, 1816, and aniong the students then in college were the present director, iMr. Willoughby, Sir G. Clerk, Permanent Secretary to the Board of <m',ntrcd*; Brian Hodgson, late resident ill Nepaul, so emilnent for hisi contributions to philology and natural history; Sir R. Barlow * Mr. Lestock Beid- and several other distinguished ,uen. Their names will sisow that Haileybury, like other colleges, has its spring aod neap tides of talent. Another distinguished epoch was in 1806-1818W, when Robert -Mertins Bird, Holt Mackenzie Xessrs. Farish. Millett, Gerald Wellesley, and H. 'l'
Prinsep wero fellow-students. It is curious that the eollege should be extinguished in a year Nvhern its e are solding the chief offices connected with the Government of India. The dying Alnia Mater rnay fairly be pictured as dictating its own epitaph to them in the well.knowni words " Si quasris momtssesctmlra circnmtss;pice!" Sir F. Currie, 'ater Sing many important offices, took his seat in tile Supreme Coancil in 1S47, and in January, 1S4S, resignad that seat to .take charge of the Punjab during the absence on sick *^er1:flcate of Sir Ff. Lawrence. He held the distinguished post ,dEResjdent at Lihore during the whole eventful yearof 1848, and, on the return of Sir R. Lawrence, resumed his seat in t&g Coua 'oil of India. We have reason to believe that since his etsarn to this coutiry the governorship of one of our 2nost imuporf.ant colonial dependencies has heen declined bhy bi-,S;g, (ldf s a71d Co.'s Homewoard Jla1.

Sir,-As you have admitted into your columns an article headed ' "Refusal to marry on Sunday," which was inserted in the Doncaster c7tronicle by the party in anticipation of the summons, and which reflects most severely and falsely on my conduct and character, I hope that, in justice to me, you will not refuse to insert the accompanying statement of the case. I am. Sir. vour obedient servant.
FORSTER MAYNARD.
Kirk Bramwith Rectory, Jan. 30.
"Themessenger senttome by thebridalparty on Saturday night gave me to understand that they could be married either at Branwith or Barnby Dann, the adjoining parish, being that of the bridegroom (the churches being about a mile apart). Aknxious, if possible, to avoid the evils attending Sunday weddings in this Sabbath-breaking district, I expressed, in very kind terms, my wish that they should go to Barnby Dann (thus losing, by the way, my Ownl fee of 10s., and having to pay out of my own pocket, which I did, my clerk's fee of 5s.).
"On Sunday morning they complied with my wish, and went over there in a covered van. On prasenting thelicense it was found to be made out for Bramwith only, and the incambent, instead of sending them back to me immediately (when there would have been time for the marriMge service to be performed), sent his clerk with the license (whiclh I thensaw for the firsttime) to ask my consent to his -marrying them there. I expressed my regret that they had misled me in this essential point; that it was not in my power to grant what the license did not allow, however much I night wish it.
'The very head and front of my offending hath this extent
'no more.'
"While Divine Service was proceeding, and we were in the middle of the Jubilate, the bridegroom (a stranger to ,se, for I had seen none of the bridal party onthis occasion) entered the church. placed himself before the desk and put the license on the Prayer-book, asking me at the same time, " Now, Sir, wiU you give me an answer or not ?" Fearing that there might be a great distarbance if I made any reply I went on with the service, taking it for granted that he would understand from my silence the serious nature of his most unseasonable interruption. Such, however, was not the case; the liocuse remained on the book where he had placed it until I came to that part of the service which was hidden byit ; and the desk being only large enough to contain the book I could not place it on the desk, but dropped it behind me (we read the lessons from another desk). lIe remained in the church for at least 20 minutes, interrupting me several times during the .itany, at the end of which he picked up the license and left the church.
"With the concurrence and advice of many friends, both clergy and laity, the case was brought before the West Riding magistrates. It proved to be beyond their jurisdtction, and was dismissed."

Sir,-I am one of many vho, thanks to your powerful advocacy, now enjoy the " Saturday half-holyday."
May I ask you to lend your aid to procure us a further boon by suggesting the advisability of the National and Marlborough-house Galleries being opened to the public on Saturdays"'
While the present regulations exist a man situated like myself has no ohance of passing an hour or two in either. For example, it isnow some time since the Turner Collection has been exhibited, and I have not only been unable hitherto to pay it a visit, but, unless it is thrown open on a Saturday, I see no chance of my ever doing so.

The Prince Of Wales A Sportsman.-The
THE P1itNcE OF WALES A SPORTS'MAN.-The Prince of Wales, much to the gratification of the farmers and other sporting gentlemen of the neighbourhood of Windsor, made his first appearance in the field this hunting season, and the manner in wvhieh the youthful Prince takes the fences as they come in his way is a P roof tbat his horsemanship has not been neglected, IIis 1ioyl Highness has been out with the Royal hariers three times. The first time the Prince went out the meet was at Mr. Aldridge's, at Cippenham, near Salthill; the next at ir. Goodwin's, at Burrham-abbey; and the third was a few days ago at Mr. White's, of Dorney.
THE QUEEN OF POLAND IN PARIs.-As the Emperor, at half-past 2 in the afternoon the day before yesterday, was leaving the reserved parterre of the garden of the Taileries, to walk on the terrace by the side of the river, an elegantly dressed lady, leading a little girl about six years of age by the hand, advanced as if to speak to His Majesty; but some of the keepers of the gardens hastened to prevent her. " Dare you touch me ?" she said, haughtily, " I am the Qnteen of Poland, and I have the right to speak to the Emperor, whose equal I am ! I order you to inform his Majesty that I am here !" There was so muach dignity in the lady's manner that the keepers hesitated whether they ought not to allow her to go to the Emperor; but some police officess who came up carried her off to the Prefecture of Police, There she was interrogated, and she again said that she was the Queen of Poland, and desired to see the Emperor, in order to request his assistance in obtaining the throne of which she had been unjustly deprived. Inquiries having been made respecting her, it turned out that she is the wife of a gentleman who occupies a high position in the financial world, and that for some time past she had given signs of mental derangement, hut that her husband and family were in hopes that she would recover without being sent to an asylum. After a medical examination she was conveyed to a maison de scand.
THE EssPREss oF AusTRLi.-A letter from Milan of the 24th of January gives the following description of the Empress of Austria:- The Empress is as beautiful as Raphae's Virgin, and as mute. Her Majesty does not speak Italian, though she took lessons from MU. Bolza during a long time. She speaks but little French. She listens, she loolcs on, and remains impassive to the compliments addressed to her on all sides. The presents made her she hands to her chamberlain without a smile or without a word of thanks. It appears that she lives solely in the love of her husband, who, on his part, appears to be passionately attached to her."
TiHE PRIINCE DE LIGNE AN-D ESIR R. PEEL.- Among the persons forming the late English deputation to the Prince de Ligne there were men who had fought at Trafalgar, Albuera, Salamanca, Vittoria, Toulouse, Waterloo, Inkermarn, and Sebastopol; and there was one whose three brothers, at one and the same time, had been ambassadors of the Kings of England. The church of England also furnished its representative. The journal which first published the Prince's reply states that " two words, far stronger than any that have appeared, were omitted, as it was deemed unnecessary to publish them. They are, however, ready should the publbshed statement of the observations made by the Prince de Ligne be considered deficient in energyv"-Expr-ess.
THE EARL oF HAREWOOD.-The bulletin from Harewood-house was a little more favourable yesterday (Sundavy morning than on Saturday. It was as follows.-
s The syaml of Harawood has passd a pretty gosd night. His Locrd. ship's symptoms are ratber more favourable tuan yesterday.
" arewood-house. Sunday, Feb. L"
The lion. Egremont Lascelles, son of the present Earl of Hare"ood, arrived at Harewood-house on Saturday evening, as has been already mentioned in The Times. The hon. gentleman was on the continent on his wedding tour at the time when the accident bappened to the noble Earl. A telegraphic message was des-patched to him at Rlome, aud he and his young bride have lost no time in returning to Eneland.
THE LATE ROBBERY AT LORD SUFFIELD'S.-On Saturday Edward Kelly and James Archer, the two men charged with committing a burglary at Gunton-haU, Norfolic, the seat of Lord Suffield, on the night of the 12th of December, were finaily examined at Norwich Castle before Mr. W. Burroighes. The c,es was noticed in The Times when the prisoners were brought up at one of the metropolitan police coUn is, and ordered by the stting magistrate (Mr. Paynter) to be removed to Norwich. The charge against the accused was supported by a great quantity of circumstantial evidence, it being shown that they vere in possession of a number of articles identified as the property of Lord Snffield on the 13th of December; that they disposed of some of them on the 15th to two Norwich pawnbrokers, giving in one instance false names, and that they sold some other things at two publichouses in the same place. Lord Suffield, who was examined during the inquiry, identified a knife, a concertina, and an opera-
lass, traced to the possession of the prisoners; and his Lordship's butler gave similar evidence with regard to other property. The prisoners, who made no defence, were committed for trial at the assizes.
EXTENSIVE CONrLAGRATION.-Last evening (Sunday), during Divine service, the metrooolis was visited by an extensive conflagration, by which a great amount of pro. perty was destroyed, and which has, it isfeared, been attended with fatal results to two persons. The fire happened just after the congregation had taken their seats in Craven Chapel, Marshal-street, Golden-square. The building in which it broke out was in the occupation of Mr. Bennett, a millner and piecebroker, situate No. 11, West-street, facing the gallery windows of the chapel, and the upper part of the premises was let out in tenements. The discovery was made by one of the neighbounrs perceiving smoke issuing tbroughtbhe windowshutters,which atonceconfirrmedlhimthat a fire was eaging within. Without a moment'sdelay an alarm was given, and after some trouble many of the inmates of the house were made sensible of their danger, when a man named Shayler rush'ed into the place and carried out in safety a wr*naan and a child. He then made another attempt to rescue two children, but as he was descending the stairease some one broke open the front door, which caused the flames to s-ush up the staircase, and to save the two okildren and his own life he had to wade through the dames. Itthen becanieapparent that no one elEe could possibly get to the upper rooms, and it was reported that a woman and her ohild were on tfie second or third floor. Neitber, however, made an appearance at the windows, but if the ruimour is oore-t that they were in tbe house at the time they unquestionably inmuet have perished. With as little delay as possib'e the engines of the parish, London Brigade, and West of Engla.nd Insoransae-pfice reached the scene, when it was found that the plugs 4af the fire mains were so firmly frozen tlsat to smemove th}em was a work of no little difficulty, and occupied considerable time, during which the lames continue to pr. egss, and eventually the premises, whith were five floo-s biig, presented a tremendous sheet of flame the reflection -of which could be witnessed by the eongregation in Craren 'hapel, but fortunately nothing like a rsh tosk place among those in the sacred edifice. The engines bhaving at length been called into active ope ration, the firemen, under itie direction of Mr. Staples, the foreman of the distriot, laboured in a most praise: worthy manner- but the ftames were not whollv extinguished at half-past 10 ,ellock last night, and the firem en-sp to thaperioe had 4)aen unable to search the rais to larn wheepr thet wo yemo4ns missing had been b',rnt to death or not.

THE WEATH1BR IND THE PARKS.
Large printed bills were stuck up in the various parks yesterday, announcing that the ice was in a very dangerous state, but many thousand persons would insist upon venturing upon it, and a great many accidents took place.
During Saturday night the thermometer at thelRoyal flumane Society's Receiving-house in Hyde Park fell as low as 16 de., indicating 16 degrees of frost. YeAterday morning at 9 o'clock the glass registered 24 deg., at noon it pointed to 28, and gradually rose till it reached 32. The barometer at 9 o'clock yesterday morning stood at 29 97. The wind at 9 in the morning was south-west. but after that time it veered completely round each point of the compass, accompanied by occasional dense fogs. The sudden change in the weather during Saturday night had the effect of also freezing the water upon the different roads of the metropolis, making them look .like irnmense sheets of glass. This made travelling on foot or by vehicles extremely dangerous, and upwards of a dozen persons were taken during the day to the hospitals who had slipped down. At Hyde Park-corner it was found absolutely necessary to gravel the roadway to enable horses drawing omnibuses or carriages to pass along. The following is the official lists of the casualties in the.different parks:-
THE SERPENTINE, HYDE PARKi.-Each bank along this river was crowvded with persons during the whole day, and the carriage drives were well filled with vehicles, containing members of the nobility and gentry, while the ice on the river was patronized by about 20,000 skaters and sliders, among whom were several Foot Guards and a fair sprinkling of the Royal Horse Guards (Blue). Sliding and skating went on without any interruption until about a-quarter past 12 o'clock, wvhen all of a sudden a cry of Help" was heard on either side. It then became apparent that several persons had broken through the ice, and were clinging to each other in the water. The society's icemen at once put off, under the direction of Mr. Superintendent Williams, but so brittle were the edges of the ice near where the men fell through that as the icemen endeavoured to pull them out they became immersed themselves, and even their apparatus disappeared under the ice. Owing to the joint exertions of the different men belonging to the society, the following were got out in a very exhausted condition and conveyed to the Receiving-house :-Mr. William Barrett, of No. 11, Keppelstreet, Chelsea; Thomas Ct-ter, a youth of 17, of No. 3, Blue Anchor-court, Westminster; Thomas Spicer, who was so much exhausted as to be unable to give his address;, r. Charles Wallett, of No. 2, Cross-street, Golden-square
Mr. Edward Augustus Davis, of No. 49, Great lueen. street, Lincoln's-inn-fields: Mr. George Balford, of No. 21, Hooper's-court, Knightsbridge; Mr. W. Smith, of No. 39, Clifton-road, St. John's-wood; and Iceman HL Smith (No. 20), -who had sunk three times in his endeavours to save the others. These persons were all placed in hotbaths and afterwards put to bed, and during the day they recovered suficiently to be removed to their several homes. Between 1 and 2 o'clock in the afternoon another fearful crack in the ice happened near the bridge. A soldier who was skating, named Browbent, of the Sth company of foot and 3d Battalion of Grenadier Guards, was followed by several others, when all of a sudden their weight caused the ice to break, and the soldier, with nearly ten or a dozen others, fell through into deep water. For several minutes their struggles were fearful, which increased upon the iceImen going to their assistance; for the moment they got to the piace the ice gave way at the edges, and they were precipitated, head foremost, among the other persons. By great exertion, however, all, including the icemen, were saved, and removed to the society's receiving-hoiise, where they obtained medical and other assistance. Among those rescued were Henry Augland and James Tolswell, both be. longing to the Royal Eorse Guards (Blue). About a-quarter to o o'clock another break up of the ice took place, when a great many others were seen to disappear. The icemen at once put off, and with the aid of laddirs and sledges, they succeeded in dragging out about ten men, who were taken to the receivinzhouse. Among the most exhausted were Mr. Pace, of Eimlico; P. Kennard, of 1.5, Charles-street, St. James's-square; and Edward Dellamore, of 17, Earl-street, London-road. While the men were engaged in their praiseworlby attempts at saving life, a great number of persons-probably 400 or 500-commencedsnowballng every respectably-dressed person who passed, not even sparing women or children. The police, after some trouble, succeeded in apprehending some of the ringleaders, but as they were taking theni they were assailed by a regular shower of snowballs and stones.
TIlE LONG WATER, KENSSINGTON G,xRDENS.-About 10,000 persons amused themselves upon the ice on this river. F our immersions took place during the day, and several persons had their heads severely cut by falling or being tripped up on the ice, and a soldier had one of his eyes nearly Cult outby the point of a skate, and was obliged to go to the hospital.
THE ROUS)D POND, KENSUZGTON GARDENS.-3,000 skaters and sliders amused themselves upon this pond ye,terday, but no accident of any importance took place beyond a few out heads.
TEE REGENT'S PARE.-7,000 sliders and skaters ventured upon the ornamental waters in this park, in spite of he cautions issued that the ice was only 2 inches thiok, and very dangerous. About 1 o'clock, gr. Leonard Stowe, No. 23, River-street, Islington, broke through the ice into 6 feet of water. He was, however, rescued and removed to the society's tent; and shortly afterwards, James Morten, of 21, Little Edward-street, Regent's Park, and George Harris, of Charles-court, Camden-town, and three or four others became immersed, some in 7 feet of water, bat they were fortunately rescued by means of the sledge and the services of Deputy Superintendent Parsons and iceman Pavey; they were attended upon in the marquee, and were after some time enabled to go to their homes.
The Victoria Park, Clapham Park, and Highgate-pond, had each a great number of patrons during the day, but no serious accident happened.
The ornamental basins in the Crystal Palace and the lake in the Surrey Gardens will be open for skating this day (Monday).

THE LAST OF AN OLD FAMILY.-Our obituary last
THE LAST OF AN OLD FAMILY.-OU1 obituiary last week contained a notice of the death of Edward Joseph Canning, Esq., the last male representative of the ancient Catholic family of the Cannings, of Foxcote, who trace their descent in an unbroken line up to an ancestor of the celebrated Wiliam Cannynge, the " pious founder of St. Mary Redeiffe Church in Bristol," in meniory of whom Sir 3tratford Canning recently assumed the title of Lord Stratford de Redeliffe. 'lhe name of Canning is derived from the manor of Bishops Canninge, in Wilts, where the family was originally seated, and where the senior line continued to reside until it terminated in colieiresces, temp. Henry VII. A younger son had settled in Bristol as early as the reign of Edward II., and the branch which he founded there was the most opulent and influential of the merchants of that city during the 14th and 15th centuries. William Cannynge was six times Mayor of Bristol between 1360 and 1390, and represented Bristol in six successive Parliauments. His son and heir was also member for the city, and served twice as nnayor. His second son became Lord Mayor of London; and his third son, Wiliam, having been several times mayor of his native city in the reign of Edward IV., foinded the noble church of St. Mary of the Red Cliffe, and, taking holy orders in his old age, retired to Weatbury.on.Trini, where he established a ColUege of Canons Secular, and where he ended his days. His tomb is still shown in St. Mary Redeliffe Church, and is justly regarded with pride even by the Protestant Bristolians. A nephew of this great and good man obtained the property of Foxcote by his marriage with Agnes, only daughter and heiress of oh lin Samon, by his wife Eustathia, deughter and heiress of John le Marshal, in whose family the nmanor and estate had been since the Norman conquest. From bin the eatate descended through a direct lne of 11 generations to the late Robert Cannig, Esq., who married, first, a daughter of John Berkeley, Esq., of Spetchley, and, second, a daughter of the Rev. J. B. Cbeston, on wbose death the property was left to his niece Estiza, the wife of Mr. Philip Henry Howard, of Corby Castle. Mr. Edward Joseph Canning, whose death
we nave now to chroniole, was the only surviving son of Thomas Canning, Esq. (uncle of the gentleman just named) by Mrs. Stonor. le was born in Hertford-street, ?.ayfair, July24, 1788, and mnarried Louisa, daughter of William Spencer, Esq., by who=4(who died in 1856) he had no issue.
ris sister Anne was Superioress of the Augustini.n convent at Paris, and another eistr niarried Joseph Blount, Esq., of Caldgrase. He wwsiimself formerly lieutenant in the 33 Regiment of Foot, and ewas so severely wounded in the unsuccessful attack upon!Berjen-op-Zoom, March S, 1814, -that he was incapacitated from further active service.- Tablet.

Robson And Redpath In Newgate.-A great
ROBSON AND REDPATH IX NEBVGATE.-A great many erroneous statements have been in circulation in reference to these prisoners, and among them was one that Robson had gone oilt of his rnind, and that he had been removed to Bethlehem Eospital as a criminal lunatic. There is not the slightest truth in this story. It appears thathe is occasiona! y subject to an effusion of blood to the brain, and upon one occasion since he has been in Newgate he had a sort of fit, but otherwise his health is perfectly good, and he performs with cheerfulness the tasks that are imposed upon all persons in his unbappy situation, such as cleaning out his cell in his turn with the other prisoners confined in the same ward, picking oakum, &c. Redpath, upon his first admission to the gaol, it appears, was inclined to resist the
rison roles, and appeared to think it absurd that a man of Eis station should have to perform the degrading offices that nust be necessarily carried out by persons in his condition. But he very soon learnt3 that in Newgate there was no distinction of persons, and that all offenders against the law, 'who were sent to that place of confinement had no alter. native but to conform to the regulations; and he therefore was obligod to do the same, and he now has to go through the same course of discipline as that which would be imposed upon the meanest felon. Robson and Redpath are
not in the same ward, but they occasionaUy see each other I while at work. They have, however, no means of communi- i cating together, although, no doubt, the mere fact of seeing each other in such a condition anvst at timies awaken strange feelings in their breasts. As iDth the prisoners have been adjudged bankrupts, and their affairs are in the Bankruptcy Court, they will Prhbl reanI xa osdrble tim i
Newgate, and t ey wlzilethen be ,ratwoved to the Peni. tentiary at Milbank. Thence, imA4U,prdxability, they will go to the Model Prison, where they .sR remain for 18 months, -"on probation," as it is titr-aoll, before their removal from this country."-Oscru,

NORTM STA'FoR.n.TTR.
nsune ham-yearly meeting of this company was held on Friday at Stoke-upon-Trent, Mr. J. L. Ricardo, M.P., in!the chair.
The report and statement of accounts, un abstract of which has appeared in 7ze Tinrnes, were submitted.
The CHIRA3N, in moving the adoption of the report, said that a considerable increase had taken place in the local traffic. The traffic they had secured had not only been obtained without any assistance from the London and North-Western Company, but, he might say, in the face of opposition on the parc of that cotnpaniy. They were enabled from the Fesources of the line ito declare a dividend at the rate of 3A per cent, per annum for the half-year, which amount they had fuyll and fairly eared. With regard to the state of their traffic, he might mention hat of the 68S,79S passengers conveyed over the line 643,354 were local passengers, and 43.444 through passengers, or rather through and local passengers, as it was difficult to sep.arate them. With regard to the goods traffic, of 455,836 tons conveyed over the line 269,000 tons consisted of local traffic, and out of the total receipts for the traffic, amonnting to 73,4851., the sum of 50,4SS1. was received for local traffic. The mineral was nearly all local traffic, for out of 194,264 tons only 11,686 tons consisted m' through traffic. These facts showed how entirely denendent they were on their owrn resources !or the dividend they had earned and were enabled to declare. The amount handed to them under the agreement with the London and North-Western Company as their proportion on account of the Manchester traffic was about 1,2001. less than in the corresponding half of last year, although it was reported that the London and North-Western Company were going to pay a larger dividend, and there could be no doubt that the traffc of that company was larger than ever, although the amount handed over to them was less. They had no means of checking the accounts, and were so far at the mercy of the London and North-Western Company in respect to the agreement. They had no alternative but to take what was given to them. The law charges amounted to 1,9021. during the half-year, and included every item under that head. An item of 1,0001. in connexion with the clearinghouse department had been brought into the past half-year's account, though it properly belonged to the current halfyear. He mentioned these matters with a view to show that everything had been charged against reven ue, and that they had not divided any more than they were strictly entitled to. They had nearly earned 4 per cent., which was the utmost amouat contemplated by the arbitrators as to the value of their undertaldng. It showed that those gentle. men had not formed too high an estimate, bat that, blocked up as they were, their net earnings would eventually very much exceed that amount. Having congratulated the shareholders on the sound and prosperous position of their undertaking, he expressed his belief that their prosperity would be progressive. (Cheers.)
Mr. BRODRICK seconded the motion for the adoption of the report, which was carried unanimously.
A dividend at the rate of 3A percent. per annum, payable on the 21st of February, was declared, and the proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the chairman and directors.
OXFORD, WORCESTER, AND WOLVERHAMPTON.
The report of the directors of this company congratulates the shareholders on the improved position of their property; it states that trafflc of every kind has increased, that the worklng expenditure has diminiched, and that the company has surmonnted much of its former embarrassment. The accounts of the half-year's working show a total receipt from aU sources of 111, 7731., and a total expenditure of 56,931,showing a balance of net profit of 54.8421. ; which sum, after deduction for interest, dividend on new debenture stock, rent of the Stratford and Moreton Railway, &c., allows a fuU dividend of 6 per cent. to the first preference shareholders, leaving a balance which, added to the small balance of last half-year, will amount to 8251. The capital has bean increased by 129,6391., and the liabilities have been reduced from 231,6321. to 110,8561. Of the new capital authorized to be raised by the last act in debenture stock 88,9541. has been created at 41 per cent. All the second guaranteed stock belonging to the company, formerlv in the hands of Sir S. M. Peto, has been resiared to the company by the repayment of the calls advanced by that gentleman, whose contract for the remaining works of the line has thus ceased. The directors report that the traffic is still much retarded on account of the paucity of sidings from the main line into the large iron and other works, and the want of accommodation at many of the stations. 'These deficiencies will be supplied as the finances of the company and circumstances admit. The Worcester and Hereford Cotpany have commenced the works on their undertakingin the neighbourhood of Malvern and elsewhere, and the directors look with great anxiety towards its progress. It is proposed to ask the consent of the proprietors to enter into a working arrangement with the projected Severn VaUey Railway Company. Both the South-Eastern and Staines and Wokingham Companies are applying to Parliamentfor a narrow gauge junction between the Reading station and Oxford and Basingstoke line, either of which, if obtained, wil give a through route from Worcester to Dover. The loans of the company falling due have been readily met, and in no case at a higher rate than 5 per cent. The pernianent way and works are in a satisfactiory state. A large amount has been expended in the half-year, in the renewal of rails, and will continue under this head for some con;iderable period. The directors direct especial attertion to the reduction of the working expenses of the company, the rate during the last half-year having been 50.93 per cent. in comparison with 68 percent. in the six months ending June 30. The expenditure would have been less but for the deficient state of the engine stock. The directors assure the proprietors that al attention shaU be given to the working of the railway in the most economical manner consistent with the real interests of the concern.
CROUIORD AND HIGH PEAK.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held at Derby on Friday, Mr. Francis Wright in the chair.
The report stated that the increased revenue had been maintained, although no increased sources of income have been as yet derived froll the iecent expenditure. The directors therero recommend the payment of interest on the debenture stock, class A, and of the dividend of six per cent. to the preference shareholders. The works between Buxton and Whaley.are now in rapid progress, and when they are completed the directors ho
to be able to show to the proprietors, the public, and the Legislature that the line will be put in such a state of completeness and efficiency as not only to meet the very large goods traffic which may confidently be expected on the opening of the Whaley jnnction with the Disley line, but also tone worked with perfect safety as a passenger line to Buxton, by which not only a great public accommodation will be secured, but also a considerable additional revenue to this company.
The receipts for the half-year ending the 31st of December last amonnted to 3,3001., while the balance due and available was 2,1651. There was a decrease of 800 tons weight, while there was an increase of 2201. in the receipts over the corresponding period of 1855.
The CI1AIRMAif moved the adoption of the report, and in reply to Mr. Goodwin said the act gave them power to borrow 6,0001., the whole of which would be required.
The retiring directors, Messrs. Wright, Arkwright, and Needham, were re-elected, as was Mr. Wheatcroft, one of the auditors.
Resolutions adopting the report and authorizing the raising of 6,0001. were passed.
The meeting was adjourned until the 26th of March, in order that a register of the shareholders might be prepared and sealed at the adjourned meeting.

The gross revenue for the half-year was 40,49S1., and the working charges, rates, taxes, and rents amount to 15,2131. (or 37. per cent. on the receipts), leaving a surplus of 25,1851. ; deducting from which for interest on loans 7,4081., for renerral of permanent way 7001., and for additional works 5501.,-8,GoSI., left 16,5261., to which must be added the balance left after payment of the dividend declared at the last general meeting, 191. 17s. 5d., out of which the directors proposed that a dividend should be declared for the pa3t half-year, payable on the 10th of February, at the rate of 2 per cent. per annum on stock A, absorbing 3,1631. ditto 5 per cent.
