GUDAT,i.-Mr. Ingham, of Percy-street, Bedford. square, who it will be remembered complainedto Sir R. W. Carden, at the Mansion-house, some 12 montbs ago, of the practices of a man representing himself by name and rank as Captain Robert F;'nn, who ap,=eaed to have carried on a system of inveigling young ladles from their homes for the, worst purposes, attended yeoterday before Mr. Alderman Ros for tho purpose of stating, and drawing public attention to the matter, that, uccording to the FranVfort .Tournal of the 6th of the present montb, an Irishman, calling himself Captain Robert Fynn, having been a solicitor, and afterwards a militry man but withal a dagerous sharper, had been aurested at inau, near Fraukrort, for cheating an innkeeper at Wilhelmsbad. But, in consequence of several frauds perpetrated upon English ladies whom he engaged as goverD2esses, and by various pretexts deprived of their money, tho authorities had detained him for the purpose of givin * him upuuder the Extradition Treaty, to be dealt with according to tho English law for those offences. Mr. Lagham's object in making this statement public was to find others who had been victunized in this way, that by their joint efforts they might be enabled to take such steps as would lead to the punishment of this man Pynn.
Alderman Rosx said of couTse this was a matterin which be could not render any assistance; but he was quite sure the press would afford Mr. Ingham every facility in making public the isportant information he had just communicated, and he trusted it might be attended with a satisfactory result.
Mr. Ingham then thankled the worthy alderman and retired.
Bow-sTEET.-A young soldier namedJohn Woodward,, who wore the Crimean medal, was brought before Mr. REwRY on a charge of assaulting Sezjesut Miller, F 8, and three constables of the same division.
The prisoner's sergeant said he was a drunken good-for..
Mr. Is observed that such conduct was disgraceful to the uniform the prisoner wore, and would bring discredit to the regiment to which he belonged. He (Mr. Henry) was grieved to see a man wearing a Crimean medal in such a position. He would give the prisoner time to reflect ou his conduct by committinghim to prison for three weeks.
Donations have been received for the poorbox by Mr_ Hall of 101. from Mfr. J. Locke, MLP., and by Mr.. Hlenry of 21. from "H MAL" Acknowledgments were requestedin The TZmts.
MARLBOROUGH-STRExT.-Thomas Martin Was charged with obtaining several watches from John Wyatt, watchmaker, No. 46, South Audley-street, by fraudulent pretences.

WousrnxP-sTRm Y.-Thomas Lewis, alias Gibson, 19, and Joseph TiUey, 10 years old, were charged with robberies.
A marriage took place on the preceding day between the members of two Jewish fanmiles residing in Finsbury. square, and this, from the manner in which it was conducted, induced a vast number of curious persons to assemble in the square, to witness as much of its external accompaniments as they could. Among these spectators were a lady named Lizrs, living in South-place, New-road, and a gentleman named Vincent, the latter on horseback. Mr. Vincent, while looking on, had his attention attracted to the ipeculiar actions of several boys, whose conduct was so susTiclous as to convince him they were thieves, and after
watchmg them a short time he at length saw Lewis, but - whose right name isbelieved to be Gibson, and who had an. overcoat slumg loosely over his arm, plant himself beside Wrs. Lizars, whose pocket he picked with dexterous coolnes5,. and, having handed what he had stolen from the lady itoc another boy near him, the second boy directly afterwards, on finding, as they believed, that they were unnoticed, gave it baek again to Lewis. Mr. Vincent at once crossed to
frs. Lizars and asked her if she had not been robbed, and the lady, on feelng in her pocket, to hersastonishment found that her purse and money had been stolen without her knowing it. The accomplice escaped, but Mr. Vincent rode after Lewis, whom he handed over to a constable, and the officer, on searching him, discovered the lady's pnrse in his pocket. Tilley, who was not concerned in this robbery, was shortly after seen to rob another lady of her purse, and on his being taken the puxse was also found upon him.
Inspector Cole, of the G division, said he knew both prisoners extremely well; both had been thieves ever since they could lift anything; Lewis hadbeen, to his knowledge three times committed for felony, if not each time eonvicted - and Tlfley usucaly " worked" with Lewis, and, being generally dressed in a pinafore, with a belt, lid such an air of innocence as to escape suspicion. On public occasions the young thieves frequently collected in numbers, and on Mrs. Lizars giving eewis into oustody she was so threatened apd terrified by ins compn mons that he the inspectorl was oliged to sent a constable f ith her till she nearly reached

to the workhouse again, came te this court, and were sent 'by the magistrate with ene of the w ant-officits, to the st. Pss wro.khouae. Jst before the closing of the court the whole of the parties again attended, in compapy with the parish offioers, when
Mr. Birchrnore, the senior relieving-officer, said that Mr. Brien came to the workhowe that morning, about o-quar? ter,past U e*clock, and demanded relief for himselt and hi men, who rwere outside. It was settled at this court tbe day before that between 9 and half-past 9, he and his compamons were to go to the workhouse, and that their aes were to be inquired Into * bat, instead of doing this, they mused the workhouse and went and met in the Eeldg. Thin2fing that some mistake might have been made, the authoritiesl and himself were quite prepared to set aside other matters, and inquire into the case. This did not seit either -r. Brien orthosehe represented, and they went away again. Thedirectorswerequite willing to meet thecasesfainy 'but they were determined not to be intimidated, and when the men eauae in such large numbers, and said that they would neither work nor go away, they came to the cionclusion that they would not be coerced, and were determined to stand upon their rights When Brien made
is appearance, he CM. Birchmore) offered to give him a ickes for the oakum-room, as he said he could not break *ones orto take hinm into the houseand pass him to his eown paih
Mr. Tmwn~r said, it was very difficult to deal with Cases of this sort, but making long speeches would not mend the matter. The duty of the relieving-officer was a very difficult one, for he stood fbetween the ratepayer and the poor man, and it often ha pened that thecaseof thepoor
ratepayer was worse than at of the men who complamed a themselves. All e couldsaywas, hehadnoauthority. When I the magistrates interceded with the relieving-offlcers, he could only say that they generis2ly-and Mr. Birchmnore among the number-attended, meet promptly to any suggestions that the magistrates made. He generally found that men wvho made long speeches were well paid for it, but he did not know whether it was so in the present case. He felt quite sure that the parish authorities would not put a watclmaker, a compositor, or amanof thatdescription to breaking stones, and he was of opinion that in some cases it would bebetter to give a little relief, if only as a matter <f 2olioy, tbLan to talke the people into the house.
a Brien: sd it was very hard that poor men like himxelf bnd those he represented should be put to atonebrealdng, then, from the report that appeared in the publio journals, it seemed that the vestry was spending money 7nost lavishly in dinners upon themselves. What he reijuired was that he should not have work given to him that would prevent him from earning a livelihood. It was aU very fine that men should have stones given them to break, and thus bo prevenited the next day from earning a liveliliood if they could get it. Those he represented did not -wat charity, nor did they want to become permanent 1aupers. They required a little out of the house.
Tne Magistrate remarked that it seemed to him that -what they wanted was charity, for they did not want to do any work for what they received. As ho said before, these eases must be inquired into, for many of the ratepayers were in very bad circumstanees, as was proved by the numler of warrants that he had signed for the non-payment ,of rates in one day.
Mr. Brien said that there were many men in court who hid not tasted food all day, one of whom he would caU forward.
A young man then stood forward, and, in answer to questions from the magistrate, said he had not tasted food all Aay. Being further pressed, he admitted that he did not belon to St. Paneras parish, hub to Olerkenwell, and that hie had applied to the authorities of the latter, who had given him an order for admittance-* but, instead of going into the house, he had attended the meeting of working macfl int Agar-ficlds.
Mr. Birehmnore remarked that that was not a solitary case -I the sort. In many eases he had offered persons orders for the stoneyard and for admittance into the house, but they hed been contemptuously refused. The guardians were uady and v,illing to inquire into and relieve every ease, but they were determined not to be intimidated by large num-
iers. There could be no mistake as to the three or four days ,n which persons who applied for relief had to ateend, for they were painted in large Roman canpitals on a black board. 7n addition to this, the directors, finding that more persons hpplied than usual, had consented to sit on the off-days. Where persons, on inquiry, were found t be respectable and had to go into the house through sickness, their goods were taken care of Nothing could be more fair than Mr. Stretton's, the chairman's statement to Mr. Brien, and lIe might further state that more than 2001. per week was given out of the house to persons whose cases had been inquired into. So that there should be no delay, three or four extra men had been placed on the staff to make inquiries.
The magistrate asked Air. Birchmore if he would give them relief that day?
Mr. Birchmoro said that he could not do so. As he said before, the directors were determined not to be intimidated. It was only a few minutes before they entered the court that Brien bad informed him that he would not be esuponsible for the conduct of the men he was leading. He might, however, admit that, so far as Mr. Brien's conduct ha yet been concerned, it had been of the most pesmiable and respectful character. Still, he could not help saying that it was very wrong for him to excite thoss whom he was leading. He would, however, say again that he was prepared to go into each case fairly, and the next day had been sot altart for that purpose. Working men seemed to think it a disgrace to break stones, hut he could only say that the pa used many hundreds of tons of stones, which vere broken by men who had nothing whatever to do with
Xr. ERlnITTsaid it was no disgrace-it was only a misfortune-to have to apply to the parnah for relief. After eautionmng Mr. Brien howlhe acted,
The whole of the parties withdrew.
The sitting magistrate has received a check for 101. for the poor-box from bin. J. Locke, M.P,; and also a check from * . W.," Stoke Newviugton, for the same purpose.

The increafe in the population of London, and the creation of new districts, both residential aud operative, In the vicinity of the river Thames, have created so great a traffic, that the original bosts are no longer sufficlent to convey it. At the prfmnt time two Oompaniels
known as the London. Westminster, and Vauxh (Iron Steam Boat Company) and the Citizen Steam Boet Company posaess a fast fleet of 17 boate, with an united power of 618 hors, na re employed on the Thames between London-bridge and Richmond.
To judge of the passenger traffic on the rirer Thames, it wilt only be necoessary to state that the average number of persons who have been conveyed by tbhebeats of thesteoOompaule escho o-tbe- 'ye- -
from 1880 to 1828. exceeded 400404 mp..e... othf-sea,
It Is to attan alU thesc advantages that a Company bas been formed for the estabUshment of acomDletoserice of teamboats for the Thames, taking as a nucleus the 27 boats and existing advantage
wbich were the support of the two aforesaid Companies, both of whloh it will be bore in mind began with a comparatively smanll number of boats, increasing their nmmuber as the trade increased and the piibUC required further accommodation,
The Scety Is created for a period of 600Years: its canital to be 3a0oO,0O0 francs(4£120,000), represented by 6,000aashares of800 frante (i I each, 2.225 of these shares are appropriated In part payment for the 27 steamers, materials, yards, and premises of the two Compa. nies, and the lewtbold properties of the pier at the foot of Batteraeabridge (Chelsea side). and of the pler near Paul's-wadrf, In the city of London, both on the river Thames, and all that formsBthe preeunt working stock of the two ComDanies.

PROSPECTUS.
The numerous and extensive robberles which have been recently effected constitute a new era in the annals of crime, both as regards the value of the property stolen and the secrecy wvith which the burglaries have been accmplished, and against which all ordinary moans of sonrity are apparently of no avail.
The modern thief and housebreaker sets at def6ance themoast approred lock, the besteonstructed iron safe, the strongest fastenings, and the most vigilant watching. so that tbe property of bankers, JeweUie, and other important establishmonts, the oocuPants of hotels, the commercial warehoutse and the private residence, are alke accessible to his reckless shill,
HapPily the ingenuity of tho age iS as fertile in defensive as in aggremsive meabureas and however singular the proposal to estabUlha kompany for the prevention of burglary asd fire may at first appear, a Calm consideration of the Tarious useful and novel purpose toswhich the discoveries ot science are now applied wi dispel much of the wonder that may be felt at such a proposition, and a cursory examination of the very simple ret highly ingenious and efficaclous invention, the general use of which it is proposed to carry out through the instrumen tality of a Joint Stock Company, will convince the modt scetical tbht sniettific means are capable o0 being easUiy and suosaefully ap. plied to the protec-Hion of both life and property.
Beforo going farthor into the matter. and (on account of the startuing nature of tbe proposition) to propitiate the mind of the reader, the promoters beg to caU attentionto extracts from many daUil and weekly London Newopapers, published within the last few weeks, which may be obtained with the prospectuses at tbe obficS, to show the opinion entertained by the Press of the invention in question; nor is such opinion confined to the Prome alone, for scientilc men. of the highest standing bave equally borne testimo.y to Its merits. The adoption by the publio generally of this invention amounts almost to a positive certainty, and must in consceuence, in a pecuniary point of view, en-mre results highly remunerative to the Shareholders
The Invention is most efficient, inexpenslve, and simplo. It3 operations connot be better describeddthan in the words of the IllUstrated London Noses, "It consists of a small spring, oDncealed In erery door window, shutter. or desk, to which It may bo thought proper to apply it; and it is Eo arranged that when any attempt at burglarinas entry, or even of tamperneg with a lock. Is made, an electric current is coin pIeced, which causes an slarom-bell to ring in the bed room of tho
meeter of the house. In the day-time, the current eon be shut off by merely turning a handle,"
It also affords a timely and effectual wvamlag against fire. In the event of more than ordinary heat being generated in any part of a house, or on board ship, a rwarning wvilf instantaneously be g,iven by the 1mm nd indticator will point to the waord" fire."/
tbno U Pomsta¢ left at nftg,t, an aiaruxm may be fixed on the to of te omidmng connected witai every neck, corner, door, shutter windowr
&c,, and upon the occurren_e of nmmsual heat, or any a tem4to enter: thiosXowerful alarum wil immediately arouse the whole neighbour-
For attaining the objects before adverted to, fur detecing the at-

At Jamaica the sugar plantations were decidedly improving, en account of the steady and good prices mn the English market. The health of the iBland was inl general good. Yelow fever still connued prevalent in Kin6ston, though it had greatly discontinued its visits among the white hroop6, who suffered so much lately. The labourmaket was very scant, as the planters could not procure sufficient labourers for planting and clearing nerw ground. Since the last mail there had been a r<ction in business, and prices had assumed an -upward tendency, speculators having entered into the market and enlivened operations. Business in general appeared buoyant. In flour several large operations had been made. Rum-proof, 3ritish cglonial, 6s. per gallon. Sugar-duty, refined, 2d. per lb. Exchanges.-90 days', i per cent. premium; 00 days', 1 per cent. premium ; 30 days', :Q per cent. premium. Private bills at par.; merchants' bills on New York, lIj per cent. premium.
From Demerara we learn that since the departure of the previous mail the cholera had spread over nearly tiea whole colony, but the mortality as yet was etot large. The total number of deaths reparted in Georgetown, from the commencement of the c&demic until 6 o'clock on the morning of the 24th -of January -was 142. A Bill had been passed bytike Court of Policy to regulate Indian inmmigratL, and the payment of bounty during the seasons of 850-7 and 1857-8. The Demera Railway was iztsather a critical position.
At Barbadoes a respectable meeting of the rate1ayers had been held in opposition to the CorporaVion BiUl before the House of Assembly. The health vf the island continued good. The revenue was in, a highly satisfactory state, and every branch of trade had somewhat improved with the newyear. The United States frigate bMerrimac was at Barbadons on the 27th of January, and the inhabitants were about to give a dinner to Captain Prenderogst and the offlicers. The officers and men received evty attention in the city.
Grenada dates are to the 26th of January. Preparations were making for the reception of the new Dieutenant-Governor, Mr. Cornelius H. Kortright, .who would Shortly enter on the duties of his office. The session of the Legislature was further postponed to the 17th of February. Fine ripening weather for the canes had come on, and manufacturing operations, whch had partially begun, might be expected to best their height by the middle of Febru-
ry. . Theeocoa crop was nob a very fruiitful one but had produced an articlb of superior quality, iand was paying pretty,well. The sanitary stateof the island ceitvinned satisfactoiy.
The sugar crops at Antigua were looking beter. The a ture was agitating to get a lighthouse erected at the entr.mce of St. John's harbour, in order to induce the Royal mail steamess to cal. there, anadto abolish port eharges on all vessels.
Lieutenant-Governor Byre had openedtheannual zes%iom.ef thc St.Vincent Legislature. TheGovemor had communicated by a message to the Legislature his initetion to depart for England about the end of Febiary, on leave of sabsence. A billhad been brought in to make the same alteration in the Exeesrtive Council Aict of St. Vincent as had been made in that of Grenada, to empower the Governmnent to add to the number of oouncillors fromaeither branch of the Legislature, but the bill -was wt lik*ly to pass.
! om Trinidad we {eamn that there was no stakmess in that island, and the rest of the islands were generally healthy.
On- the 20th of December a slight eheokef an earthquake was felt in the city -of Mexico, which lastod 30 seconds. On the same day a fearu storm xaged.k Vera Cruz, in which sevea vesels were lost -nd above 80 persons perished.

Her cargo comprises 98 boxes of oranges, 106 pachiges of tobamco, 5 cases of ostrich feathers, 269 bales of silk, 8 ba-les of wool, 66 bags of incense, 35 cases of gum, and 135 packages of general merchandise.
The Pera on her outward passage experienced strong 'winds, but generally fair, and completed ber voyage to Alexandrisinl 0days and18 hours. Homewards she has met with fine weather and generally fair winds, and has maade a mod remarkably quick run She was 3 days 5 hours from Alexandria to Malta, 3 days 10 hoursthence to Gibraltar, snd from Gibraltar to Sothiampton she has made the unprecedented passago of 3 days 22i hours; making from Alexandria 10 days 13 hours, ana from Malta 7 days S hours. Her average during the voyage has been nearly 12 knots,-a rate of speed scarcely to be expected from a Ship of 2,620 tons, and a propelling force of only 4.50 horse power.
On the 15th inst., at 3 p.m., off Cape Trafalgar, the Pera exchanged colours with the Peninsular and Oriental Com. pany's steamer Alhambra, steering for Gibraltar.
On the 16th, 20 miles south-west of the Burlingg, observed a vessel with no canvass set and apparently a wreck. Cap. tain SOy at once shortened sail, and proceeded towards her with the view of saving any of the erew who might be yet on board Sho proved to be the bark Ralph Thompson waterlogged nd abandoned; her miLinmst gone six feet from the deck, fore and mizenmasts standing, and all her sails gone; so she hbd probably been visited before. She was a vessel of_y, 30tons, and was drifting on towards the land. She was just in the track of steamers, bub if the wind and set continued as it was, from the westward, she would in a few hours be well in shore off the Burlings.
At 3 p.m. on the 18th the Pera exchanged colours with the company's steamer Madrid 20 miles south-west of Ushant, steering south-west; and also with one of Her Majestys gunboats, steering south-east.

The Gi&r-a?r ihronicle of the 10th says:-
"The anxiously-looked-for easterly wind, 'which set in at an early kour this morning, has enabled the numerous fleet of meerhant vessels detained in our bay, Algeciras Roadstead, and at the back of the Rock to proceed to their various destinations. It is computed that there are now not less than 500 under sail on their way towards the straits."
Four French vessels (Bienvenu, Deux Ereres, Jeune Clara, and Marie Eulalie) and a Norwegian schooner, all laden with 'wheat, had been lost, together with their cargoes, off the bar of Bayonno.
The Britlsh schooner Bahhinacurra Lass, and the Portu. guese schooners IJnion and Alegria, partly laden with grain at Mazagn, had been lost at that port.

By the Magdelena steamer, from the West Indies, we have files of Panama papers to the 23d of January. The British steamer Bolivia arrived at Panama on the 21st, with dates from Valparaiso to tho 1st, and Callao the 11th.
From Chili we receivo tho usual satisfactory confirmation of peace, progress, and plenty existing throughout the oountry, although the past season's crops bad suffered from tbh inclemency of the weather, so as to make many articles of consumption iiconvenentli high priced for the lower classes.
The Valparaiso Railway was progressing favourably,
Businmess had not been so brisk as usual during the fortnight in Valparaiso, owing to the great scarcity of specie, caused by heavy exportations of that article of late to Europe.

From Pera we learn that the revolution continued, and was dra-wing nearer the capital, the possession of the vessels of wvr giving General Vivanco a great advantage over the Government in being able to move his forces from point to point. On the 31st of December the steamer Apurimsc and brigantiae Loa, bearing the flag of General Vivanco, made their appearance in the harbour of Callao, to the great discomfiture of the inhabitants of the town and of the Government pasty. Boats from the Apurimac were immediately sent to tke French ship Perseverante and the English steamer TLibune, for the purnose of informing the commanders that the object of Vivanco?s visit was not to bombard the town, but to take possession of the steamer UcayalL Various demonstrations were made in the harbour during the day, bat no hostilities took place. At halfpast 6 on the evening of the same day the steamer Tumbes entered the harbour, and took up her position along with the rest of the squadron. On the following day other ships arrived, and some firing took place between the vessels and the Arsenal, which continued for half-an-hour on bo'lh sides, and resulted in five of the revolutionargparty being killed and seven wounded, the Government forces suffering no damagoe. Genesal Castilla sent to Bellavista for three battalions and some areillery stationed, there, which sooa arrived, and were posted at the Custom-house and on the Mole, but they took no part in the action. The Los then retired, exchangig ots with the Ucayali and the guns on the Mole until out of range. The fire from the castle was kept up against her -antho sho reached the place where the othervessels were anchored.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I am exceedingly sorry to have to trespass on your valuable space again. 'he oniy apology I can offer is that I think it behoves every member of Parliament to show that whenever he addresses the House be takes care to aavauce nothing that he is not in a condition to prov.
Now, your correspondent " H. T." observes that the House possessed little Inowledge of Indian matters not to have set me right when I spoke of General Nott as second in command to Sir George Pollock.
This is at once to charge the House and myself of igno. rance 'ith respect to the subject under discussion.
He further states that " General Nott was second in com. mand to no one."
Yet he afterwards admits that when a junction was formed between Pollock's force and Nott's, "Nott, as junior, became subordinate to Sir George, but he never occupied the place of mere second in command."
mscare"y hererstand what "'H. T." means by the word "mrsheointroduced. The Army Regulations distinctly rule that command belongs to the genior officer;* therefore, from the moment Nott joined Pollock, Nott, being the junior, hdecame to all intents and purposes the second in
Whatever may be the opinion of " H. T.," Nott, in his letter to POllock, dated September 17, 1842, respecting detaching a brigade to Bameean, shows that he at least was in no error onthe subject, for he thus expresses himself .-
" 6. After bringing to your notice, ahowing that my men require rest for a day or two, that my camels are dying fast, and that my supplies sare nearly excended, you should order my force to be divided, I have notg to do but irnplicitly to obey your orders."1
I should be vetyinudh gratified if -your teaders would recolloct t'hat the cAuso~ I advocAted was Sir G. Bullock-'s, and his only; and, whe recognizing to the fullest extent the merit of those in the Affgbn war that had erit, I carefpuly avoided unn'e,essarily oeenpying the time of the .oue it avoimdted .htto oueio f moy motio.

A few minttes aSter 12 o'c0lock tbis a an awd explosion took place at the Lund-hill colliery, sitate&a about hf a anile from the Wembwell station on the South Yorkshie Hlway. The pit, which is about 220
adsdeep, belongs to TaYlor and Co., and is worlked by WeWAte Shift of men night. and day. The dxy wvorkwers. to the number of 180 men and 8 Lds, descended at 6 o'cloc5c this morning. At 12 o'clock 22 of them, who reside ieAr the pit, came Up to diner, the rest remaining to pkstke of that meal in tho pit. Shortly afterwards a fearful e&ploslo

Shemeld and this plce for anumber of fireengineg, some of. 'which hav now arrived.
Tihe cause of the explosion is as yet involved in mytery. The overlooker states that when he went round the pit before the day men descended this morning all was then peretly safe.
URTEbR PA.RICULiMs.
The fire began to blaze from the air-saft aboat 4 'clocck.: and sent up an Immense hbmber of sparks and pieces of burning wood, which had p maost terrible appearance.
About.? @clock tho proprietors and ianagers of thepit ha-. s cofirence, andl decided to stop up the mouths of tho worldng shafts with planks and earth, as the only way of Btopping the draught up the air mine and subduing the fire. This plan was attended with partial success, and about half-past 8 oclock the flames ceased to ascend above the surfacoe of the ground.
Frevious to this several miners had entered the pit, and penetrated some distnce along the main tramway, but found the worldngs so full of sulphur as to preclude all entrance into them. The stoppings by which the workings were ventilated had been blown down, and the greatest havoc made with the works generally, so that there is not the slightest expectation of any of the miners who are yet inthe pit being fescued alive. Twelve or 13 dead bodies were picked up in the main tramways, and carried to the bottom of the shaft, but It was found so urgent that the mouths of the pit should bo closed that they were allowed to remain there. Several of the miners taken out alive are dangerously injured.
The pit has only been in work two years, and was cousidered one of the besgtrentilated mines for miles around. It is supposed that a fall in some port of the works has led to the explosion.
It is expected that some days wil elapse before the fire will be sufdicieutly extinguished to permit the pit to be entered.

Another Accident On The Newcastle And
ANOTIEmp -ACCIDENT ON THE NEWCASTLE AIM TYNEaOUTH RAMWAY.-Another alarming accident has occurred on the Xewcastle and Tynemouth Railway. Tuesday morning was damp and foggy, and the rails were greasy and slippery. The ordinary 9 o'clock train left Tynemouth punctuallyat the honr,but having a liht engine it did not arrive at Walker, two stations from Newcastle, until after half-past 9, and left that station a little before the time the 25 minutes past 9 express from Tynemouth was due. Strange as it may seem, none of the wayside stations outhis important branchare connected by telegraph, and,as no precation had been taken to prevent an accident shortly after the 9 train had crept away from the Walker station the express, which does not call between Shields andNewcastle, came rushing up. Those on the engqne saw the 9 train in advance, and were endeeaong to stop the train, but from the condhtion of the rails this was no ord nary task. It ran thundering into the 9 train, throwing the passongers in both trains about in an extraordinary manner, and
cking in the end of the Lhsthird-vass carrie thepa
Eengers inw hich suffered considerably. Mr. Bet a Shields butcher, had to be taken to his home, and two women had to be attended by medical men in Newcastle. Mr. Christian Hanson, broker; Mr. I.otinga, broker; Mr. Raminid, broker; and Mr. Robert Spence, banker, who vere travel

Mr. Van flarpen, shipbXokcer, who was much hurt at the same time, got out for a abort timb on Wednesday. Mr.and mliss Green still continue poorly. Theso calties are casing much alarm and excitement in Newcastle and Shibld6.
CRuELTY TO CHiLDREN.-Two cases of an exceedingly painful nature have just occurred in Devonshire, which have caused considerable excitement. On Tuesdny an inquest was held at -Dawlish; before -Mr. W. A. Cookey, coroner, on the body of a girl, aged 15, named Jane Newberry, whose death was reported to have been caused through the ill-treatment of her father, William Newberry, a shoemaker of the town. It apeared that the poor child had lived with a dairyman. at Mount Radford, near Exeter, and not lildng her work, and having complained of " pains in her head," the father was written to, and came to see her. As soon as he saw the poor child the witnesses stated that he struck her a severe blow on the side of the head with his fist and knocked her down. While lying on the ground he cicked her three or four times on the legs and on the stomach. The poor child was taken home shortly after this brutal treatment, and on the 6th of February a surgeon (Mr. Baker) was called in, but she was then ina, dying
tate, and the next day she died. The aurgeon, who made a post morem examination of the body, by oider of the coroner, stated that the child's brain was very mnuch diseased, and he believed she died from the "softened state of the brain." He considered that the death of the deceased might have been accelerated by the ill-treatment she received. The jury, after some deliberation, returned a verdict of "Died from natural causes," but requested the coroner to reprimand the father of the poor child for his brutal treatment of her, which the Tcorouer did in severe, but very proper terms. A case -illustrating defects in the workhouse system has occurred at Exeter. A lad aged about 13, named James Harris, a few days ago,-was seen by a woman to fall down in the High-street. On being taken to the Guildhall he was found to be in a dying tate, and two days afterwards he died. It appearedthatihepoor child had left bis home in Herefordshire to accomano a b*hndvagrant. Theytravelledtogetber as far as Hatherleigh, -in Devonshire, where the hr said he wyasbadly treated by his blind companion; and he aw from-hisn He cami toyxeterand was admitted as a vsgrantintothe workhouse.

The writ having at leDgth been received, the nomination id fixed to take place at Lewes on Monday weer, the 2d of March, and the polling on the Thursday foUowing. The delay in the issmnfg of the writ, consequent on Mr. :rewen's longretention of his seAt, has led to a published correspondence between the central committees of the respective canaidates, Mr. J. G. Dodson and Viscount Pevensey. In reply to the cbarge made by the committee of Mr. iDodson "that Lord Pevensey's cammittee, having supported *r. Frewen, were hound to call utpon himu to fulfil his pledge to resign, and thus to put an end to the present stagt of the representation, proauced by a course of conduct most unusual and disrespectful to the constituency," his Lordshie's committee remark, "That they could be n no sense -whatever responsible for 3r. Frewen's retention of his seat or the
delay of the writ," but that " circumstances which they could not control interposed to delay the issue of it." Both candidates have been busily engaged in addressing the electors at the meeBt important towns aLnd poling places in the division, and the belief at present is t hat the contest will be a very close one.

THE LAW OF LIBEL.
Lord CAMPBELL pve notioe that on Thursday next, tbe 26th inst., he woula move fora select committoe to conaider w ther Tfe priileges now enjoyed by the reports o proceedings in courts of justice may be sfely and properly extended to seports of procebdings in the two Houses of Parliament, and to any and what other assemblies or public nieetings, underany and what oonditions and restrictions.
THE; CHIESE DIFFICULTY.-THE ARROW.
Earl GREY.-I wish to.put a qufftion to mynoble friend whichI understand he is willing to answer at onoe. It has reference to the debate whih i stohtkoplceon, Teesdaynext. As it is of the utmost importance to acertWin whether the Arrowwag leal pUentiUedto carryrit
colours, I find that in the :Uercant Shipping Act, pase in 154, it is provided that no ship is to be registered is a British ship, in any part of tho British dominions unless she be entirely owned lay kritith subjects, according to the definitions given In the Act. Nt, we knowi Irdin the papers whiCh have beem lid before us that the Ariow was not owned br Britishxabjets. TheActof l$54further confers powers upon tolonial Legislaturet to alter orvary the provisions of that Act, but subjdct to the condition that any Act or ordinance passed for the purpose of alterink the Act of Parliament must be approved by Her Majesty in Council, and such approval mnut be proelaimed in the colony before such ordinance can pln effect. I want to know whether there have bee shy orders given by Her Majesty in Council snctioning the two oolonlal ordinances which are printed in the papers recntlylaid before the House; and, if so, what is the date of those orders, and also what is the date of the proolamation in fhe'colony ? I am induced to ask theso questions, because It is the ordi-
aryprcioo wlth regi r& *ordin e sedby.*hat are eommonly. " Croi olown solo oe6ssing no representativeI eidatare,hattheirotdinanws arealwayscoisfirnedi not by ordersin Counit but by asimplesignification ofEtei MajesWs pleasute in adespatchfromtheSecretary of State. As far as I can gather from the paiper before the House it does not appear that in. this instance tho usual form of pro. ceeding in the case of Crown colonies has been: depart
from, although the Act of Parliataent is express in :requring that the confirmation of any ordinance altering the providons of the Merchant Shipping Act shall be approved by Her Majesty in CounciL This point is material because it appears that the despatch of approval it dated December, 1855, while the register of the Arrow was dated in Septem. ber, 1855.
Earl GRANVILLE-I must inform mynoblo friend that he is correct in inferrirng that there were no orders in Council respecting the ordinances, but that they were confirmed by Iher Majesty with the advice of the Secretary of State; The first ordinance was passed before the Merchant Shipping Act came into force in the colony. It would be neces. sary now in any amendment or repeal of any portion of that Act that the colonial orainances having that object should be approved by Her Majesty in Council, and proclaimed in the colony. Bat this particular ordinanoe, in the opinion of the law advisers of the Colonial-office, is nQt of that description. It is not considered to be a repeal or amendment of the Merchant Shipping Act. As to the vessel being required to be the property otBritish owners, itis quite true that in this case under the prdina6ce a regis. ter wa given to a ship in the possession of. aChinese, be holding a long leae of land inihe colony. The noble earl wil remember that the Alien Act conferred uplonaliens in the colonies the same privileges possessed by our own coun. trymen. Thesubject will, no doubt, ebe fully debited on Tuesday next, and, therefore, it is rot necessary I should enter further into the matter at present.
Earl GREY.-I will just readthe clauses of the Merchant Shipping Act, which seems to m e to be veryimportant upoi this point. The second part of the Act applies to all the dominions of Her Majesty. The second clause of that part of the Act delares that no ship shall bo admitted to be a British ship unless belonging to owners of the following description :-" Natural born British subjects, or persons nIde denizens by letters of denization, or naturalized by or pursuant to any Act of the Imperial tegisature, or by or pursat to sny Act or ordinance of the proper legis lative authority in any British possession, oi bodies corporto eitblished under, subject to the laws of, and having their principal place of business in the united kingdom, or some British posse-sion."
THE WAR WIT CHThTA.
The Earl of DERBY said he should now read tho resolui tion which he meant to lay on the table on Tuesday next, and ofw hich he had aready given notice. It was inthese
termNs:- ''''. '''
" Tbatthis Etouse has heard with deeap regret of the mn tertuption of amnicable relations between Her Majesty's sbjects and the Chineseauthorities, at Cantoi, arising out bf the measures adopted by-HerMajestysg Chief Suporintendent of Trade to obtsui reparatiozs for alleged infractions of the supermentary treaty of the Sth of October, 1843.
That in the opinion of this House-the occutrence of differences on this subject rendered the time peduliarlyunfivourable for presslng on the Chinese authorities a-claim for the admittance of British subjects into 4anton, which had been left in abeyance sinco 1849, and for supporting the same by forcoe of arms.
"That in the opinion of this House operations of actual hostility ought not to have been undertaken without the express instructionls, previously received, of Her Mfajesty'si Government, and that neither of the subjects adverted to irnthe foregoing resolutioua aflrded suflicient justification for such operations,
THE SUPPLY OF GUANO.
Lord POLWARTH save notice that on Monday next he would move for any papers or correspondence relative to the cession of the islands of Haski, Gibleu, and Ghuragoul by the Imaum of Muscat to Hcr Majesty, and their erection into a colony; and also to call the attentio of the House to a license granted on the 20th of February, 1856, by tbe Commissioners of Emigration to John Ord >und others, giving them the sole and exclusive rigt to raiseand take away guano from these islands during five years.
THrE GOY.SRIqMENT OF INDIA.
The Marquis of CLAXEICABDE, in rising to move, pursuanitto notice, a resolution condemnatory of the present system under which the governmnentof India is administered, saidhe was deeply sensible of exposinghimselftoa charge of something like presumption in attempting to bring before their lordships a subject on which the greatest statesmen in our Parliamentary history had greatly differed, and with which the Legislature of this country had ever found it mostv difficultto deal. But when the necessity of. the subject was takdh into consideration he felt he should not be fulfilling his duty if he did not attempt to bring it under their lordahips' consideration, HIemight be told that it was impossible for any memnber of either Htouse of Parliament, not having at his back a large party to support him, to attempt to carry to any successful issue a discussion like that which he was nowr originating. If the object he had in niew wras to suatch a momentary triumph, or to obtain a great majority in his favour on a division, he might perhaps be amenable to the charge of being actuated by party or personal motives; but he had no such wish; on the contraryj his only desire wras to imspress on the Government and on Parliament the necessity of dealing with the question, and, that being so, he saw vho reason why he, holding though he did only a humble cosition in that Houe,. ahould not endeavour to draw their lordships'atEtention to it. The subject itself had had the advantage for mazny years of being elevated above the renoh of all party objects and a11 party feelings. Their lordsfhips ksnewr, moreover, by experience thart it was only by repeated'
discussion that measures of real and urgent importance could be forced on the attention of the Government. It was by such discussion that every great measure passed since he had had the honour of a seat in that HIouse had ultimnately been brought to a successful issue; and it wras ouly by the voice of Parliamnent and cf public opinion operating upon the Governm2ent for She time being that they c ould be compelled to take up many imnportsint questions which ought to pe made the subjects of legislation. Their lordships Mad it inevidence from all parties that the higher classes of the people of India wrere pasding wvholly awvay, and that those in the mniddle ranks of life were becoming sradualy depressed to the condition of the lowrer orders. If that wras true, he submitted it wras a subject for immediate inquiry. When we assumed. the goveroment of India wre .vv~ uu urslvs aheay rsp nsiiiy tWsb
took upVIs ourvelvos A heavy rosp-.ndibility. It was by force of conquest that we became the governors of
140,000,000 or 150,00.000 of people. He believed our poweer in that country might be used greatly to advance the nappiness by improving the condition of its inhabitantsand natives; bat that could only bo done by our showingour capacitv to govern them, and by the constant supervisionvof Parliaent, and its interference whenever interferenco was necessary. e ha aa strong opiuiox that the improverment of India, which Lid gone on at so slow a rate that it could hardly be said to progress, had all along been greatl nimpede, and was at this moment impeded, by the machinery oE our present system of adminutration. He did not raean, 2 saying that, to point to any person or' indivdual whatever. On the contrary, he -had the' highest respot individually for the various= persons weo were concerned in conducting that. complex.system of government. He had the fullest confidence ir hisnoble friend and relative who now filed theidisfinguished office of Governor (enera, nd in thea n bilitk, fiimne5 and disvretion which lhe would-bring th bear,i imoprovingethe -nd condition of' the peopleand the British cc in tbt .country. }ImHa ew thbt the.Court of Directors ?wad'c6m pose*of nen o!, consideration And position, entitli-g them to the highest respect of every mnember oftheir' lrdehipa House; and he must sy that W ibgbtt hon. friend Xr

t rance. Of the increase which had taken place, however, since 1848, he found that no less than 2,730,0001., or abou, 500,0001. a-year, had been obtained from the article of opium alone-an increase which was entirely attributable to the policy of the noble earl opposite (the Earl of Ellenborough, who, turning to proer advantage our conquests and extensions of territory on the western side of the Indian empire, raised the duty, and did all in his power to prevent the smuggling of opium. He (the Marquis of Clanricarde) could not admit, bowever, that that was a safe or steady basis upon which to rely for an increased revenue; because it did not depend upon the energy of the cultivators of ths H)il, or the exertions of the Government, but upoa the taste and foLy of the Chinese people. Moreover, the war which we had just commenced with China was likely, he apprehended, to strike a heavy blow at that source of revenue; and he believed that if those who were now called "rebels?' should succeed in expelling tlhe ruling dynasty, and in establishing their own power, tbey would allow opium to be grownin China itself and, while they raised from it a considerable home revenue, they would take care that the price should be such that opium grown in Western India would not be able to compete with I it. Another large source of revenue in India was derived | from theland-tax. It was very difficult to ascertain what were the progressive receipts of that tax, because the area of the empire was constantly increasing; but he feared thatan examination of its proceeds would fail to denote any augmented prosperity among the cultivators or holders of land. He was afraid, if they looked to the incidence of that tax, with a view to its revision, which ought to take place at once-not forfiscal purposes,but forthe canse of hunanity andof goodgovernment-thatthey wouldfind thatit wasvery improperly and unequally levied, and that,instead of increasing it, they ought to make an immediate, a large, and perhaps a permanent, reduction in that impost. That had been recommended in Madras by Lord Harris, and he knew not upon what principles the advice could be resisted. The other sources of revenue comprised the Excise, which was so mixed up with the land-tax that it was not easy to collect its amount, and the Customs' duty, which, from a populatioaof 140,000,000,yieldedonlyl,200,000l.a-year, and included thatmost unmuat andiniquitousof imposts. the salt d.ty. It was lamentable to think how little had been done for India in the matter of railroad communication. 'Up to 1849 no contract was made for any railway in India. In that year two contracts were entered into- but up to last hlay no more than about 200 miles of railway had been opened in the whole country. Colonel Kennedy, in his evidence on public works, said truly that prosperity in India could not exist to anT appreciable degree without railways, canals, and irrigation. It was but just to Lord Dalhousie to state that be deserved the greatest credit for the completion of the Ganges canaL That was a work of the highest importance, and it reflected honour upon the Government of Lord Dalhousie. Colonel Kennedy further said:-
" There are not in India above 3.000 or 4,000 miles of good metalled roads, while in England there are 120,000 miles. One-tenth would probably be a fair Propurtional extent, and this would give a demand upon Thdian Government for 200,000 miles of roads."
The witness was not speaking here of provinces lately taken from native princes, but of districts which had been in our possession for 50 and 100 years; and his statement was that in those parts of the country there were only 3,000 or 4,000 miles of road. The truth seemed to be that the machinery of the Government in India impeded the construction of railways and other public works. In 1851-2 there was a great and general demand for railways in India, It -was said that India was to be supplied with railwaysthroughout its whole extent. That, of oourse, was an exaggeration; but the Indian Government recommended that the three capitals should be connected by railways at once. It was calculated that a great saving to the Government in mlitary expenses would be gained by the construction of such railways, and therefore it was thought that the Government should guarantee, as it had done, a dividend of f per cent. That was a rather imprudent arrangement for the Government to make; but, such as it was, it had been entered into to a large extent, and many companies had been formed in England for the construction of railways in India. Colonel Kennedy, the engineer of the principal railways in India, in a report addressed to the directors of one of the companies, said:-
"In London there are at present the directing boards of five different Indian railway companies, in reference to the proceedings of which companies the most minute control is practised by both branches of the home Government of India. All railway matters, however slight, must receive the considerationand sanction of the Court of Directors and Board of Control, carried on with all the tedious forms of epistolary routine, but without the exclusive devotion of any special and publicly resFonsible professional officer whose duty it should be to inforn those bodies on matters requiring professional explanation."
He went onto relate the interference of the Board of Directors as to a particular lne of railway which he had planned, but which they rejected, requiring the construction of another line, and then naturally remarked:-
"If engineering details are left to the decision of men without professional knowledge, acting either upon their own unaided intellect or upon secret counsel derived from irresponsible professional persons, nothing can be more certain to produce confusion and waste, andthis secret counsel would be the most mischievous of all The interest of companies should be cautiously guarded against the effects of all officious and underhand influences of every cliss, more particularly in reference to their engineering proceedings, considering the number of patentees, their connexions and ,catrong,-of men identiied with particular views by previous practice, and clinging, perhaps, to errors by the mere foree of habit, or vamity mn sustaing their past acts, -of men connected with paRticular cliques, parties, or theories, or who may be interested in supporting antagonishic projects."
No Imperial Government would ventrme to act in that manner; hut the Board of Direcors, so used to scrneening
oters fromitaresponsibfity and beningescreenedg themselves, had no hesitation in doing seo. CboloDnel Kenneedy the gaeve, the followinug instance:-
" On the 16th of April, 1855, we receive the offislt communication from the .Hon. Court adopting our compn for the line between Bomof y andshmedalad, but renuiring us to commence at Surat, 180 miles from Bombay, thereby rendering fuile the providence of our arrangements to secure profitable work for our engineers during the summer The result of all this has bcen that, out of 30 months that cur establishment of engineers has been located and paid in India, they have been only 14 months profitably employed, and 16 doing nothing-a waste of tim and mtoney which our directors sought by every possible
Such was the result of the interference of the Board of Directors in the matter of railways. (Hear, hear.) Reverting for a moment to the public debt of India he might mention that on a portion of that debt theinterest had been reduced from 5 to 4 per cent.; but that reduction was one of the most improvident and unfortunate steps whichhadbeen taken of late years in Indian finance. A blow was struck at the credit of the Indian Government ; there was an immediate demand for money; a loan of some millions at 5 percent. was obliged to be opened, and the Government had to attach to the offer a condition to the effect that the interest would not be reduced. Moreover, they had been compeed to open another loan, which was s i open, and that loan they could not get taken at f per cent. (Hear, hear.) He would now refer to another test of good government-perhaps the first and most important of all-the administration of justice. The administration of justice in India wasadisgraceto England, and wouldbea disgrace toany civilized country in the vorld. (Hear.) He need not prove that, because it hadl been Admitted by every one, bothi out of and in the Court of Directors. In 1833 Mr. Macaulay saoid that there was no country in the world which so much required a new code of law as India; but it was not a code only that was wanting. What he complained of was, not the absence of uniformity, but the absence of law, and the fact that the criminal courts were not reaUy courts of justice, but instruments of cruelty, persecution, and revenge. In 1834 a commi sion was issued, and in 1837 a new crinainal code was presented to the Government. It was sent for examination in India, was returned thence to the Board of Control and the Court of Directors, was again sent to India, was returned a second time to England, and was again despatched to India, where it remained for some time in the hands of the Government. If one of Her Majesys Ministers had been officiaUy reswnsible for the good goverment of India no such delay would have taken place; at all events, he would have taken care thit the objects of the commission were properlyl carried out. IIe would on this subject quote the words of a right hon. gentleman whose name and character were respected by all-he meant Sir Edward Ryan. That gentleman said --
" Have the provisions of the Act of 1834 effected the objects which were contemplated in 1829 ? Certainly not. It -was the intentionx of the Legislature, under that Act of Parliament, as is to be gathered from the words of thu Act itwlf, that the commission should make inquiry into the exiBting system of the courts, and examine the state of the judicature generally in both the Queen`s and the Company's couts;tha, atera fll xamnatoninto the subject, it
mlornestte f ho Puen' cort; nor have any reports of that nature been made; nor has thecommission personally visited or inspected the state and condition of any of the
courts in the interior; but it did proceed in 1835, when it was established, to the consideration of a code of criminal law.,"
A new code of laws had been promised for that country, but as yet no such code had been introduced, and meanwhile the administration of iustice remained in a state of confusion and unLCertainty tKalt wras positively disraeful. Could it be believed that in India there was a Tvlar bdir of Her Majesty's subjects who had no legal protection whatover for their property ? The rights o=fprperty as respected the
natives were in a state of utter confusion, and had been so ever since we took possession of the country. In these re-

but because the _haracter of the magistrates who were to hi ntrusted with the execution of the new code was such thaM
they could not submit to their' jairisdict ion. On this point he would quote the opinion of a gentleman who had li ed long in India, who was aa officer of the Supreme Court of Calcutta-he meant hlr. Dickens. Hle said,-
"The best tools in the hands of bad workmen can prodace but indifferent zesults. In thiscaseyou havejudgesand magistrates wanting in legal knowledge, without administrative experience, without the check of a bar, hardly able to speak, and certainly not to read, the language in which their proceedings are recorded, and very often not understandimg the dialect of the witnesses; at the meroy, in an extraordinary degree, of ill-paid native underlings; men of extrome youth, discharging other functions incompatible with judicial duties, totally without independence ; each man ex officio a judge, whetherfi' for the office or not, with more work than he can do, however honestly disposed, and yet without any incentive to work at all. What in the world can yon expect from an average man under such, circumstances? And what manner of thing, think you, Is that which they dispense, and which has been with grim facetiousness called justice? A law made by the angels of heavgn, asd administered by such judges, sitting in such courts, could scarcely be anything short of a curse."
(Hear.) Undoubtedly the administration of the law in such' circumstances wouldbeacurse, anditwonldremainso tiUlsuch improvements were introduced as would place the sapervision of the local courts in the hands of proerly trained and trustworthy magistrates. It would, perhaps, be said. by those who supported the existing system that the law was administered so as to suit the varying oircumstances of the people-at one time adapted to the wants of the Gentoos, at another time to those of Mahomedans, and so on; but the truth was that the men who administered the law were wholly without training and experience, and the consequence was that, in many cases, they created what in this country was called judge-made law. As a specimen of the spirit in which the law gonerally was administered in that country, he would Lraw the attention of the House to to the folowintg case :-A Mr. Plowden was sent to Xagpore to administer the law. This gentleman was an old and experienced servant of the Company, and must have known what were the usages and feelings of his masters, and what was likely to be approved by the British aathorities in India. There was at the same time at NTagpore a British subject with whom he had a dispute, and this individual he arrested and forcibly deported out of the country. The injured individual brought an action against him and recovered damages; but an appeal to the highest tribunal was brought by hr. Plowden on the advice of the Advocate-General,the chief legal fanctionary inthecountry. That functionary made so able and strong an appeal to the Court that it took time to decide. It was considered a doubtful matter whether, at this time of day, there was a part of Her Majesty's dominions in which it was in the power of a gentleman, sent to a particular district to represent the Government, forcibly to take a British subject and deport him out of the country. (Hear.) This showed the spirit in which the civil sernce of the country was carried on. He would mention another case. A &r. Thomas, a magistrate, sent notice to a wealthy native merchant named Bhawanny Lallah to appear before him 70 miles off,without any reason or proper form or any charge being made against him, and on his appearing committed him to prison. HXe was kept in prison for a fortnight, and wFas then ordered to find bai; but the sureties he tendered were refused, and he was again imprisoned for a further term. The merchant brought an action and obtained small damages against Mr. Thomas, Chief Justice P awlinson remarking,-
"I cannot find in my notes that any charge whatever was made against this plaintiff, nor does all alTged against him in the highly-coloured statement called ' a sentence' amount to any charge."
The whole proceedings must have cost the plaisitiff at least 600L or 7001., and the damages he obtained were very smaU in amount. uad a poor miian ventured to bring an action under such circumstances he would undoubtedly have been pounced upon at the first opportunity by the magistrate of the district, and saubjected to the system of torture-for it could not be caUed anything else-of which Bhawanny Lallah was the victim. He the Marquis of Clanricarde) wished to know how it happened that, after such an occur. rence, Mr. Thomas was allowed to retain his office? He had seen it stated publicly, and upon high authority, that within a few years a judge in India, in the receipt of 2,0001. a-year, who had been, convicted of fraud in open court, and who was removed from the ludicial bench, had been appointed to an office in which he received 6,0001. a-year. It could not be expected,wvhen the natives -witnessed such proceedings as these, that they should feel any confidence in or attachment to the Indian Government, and it was not surprising that British capital should be withheld from a country where law was administered in such a manner. Their lordships were aware that young men of 20 years of age were sent out to India,where thev were at once appointed deputy-magistrates, and, although wfithout any legal training or experience, were required to adjudicate upon questions of the utmost Importance to the parties concerned. To show their lordships the feeling entertained on this subject by capitalists in India, he would beg their attention to the folowmg extract from a petition presented to Parliament by the mdigo planters:-
" The criminal courts of the East India Company have been the dread and terror of the people, are used as instruments of revenge and persecution, convictions in them are regarded as evidence quite as much of misfortune as guilt, and the publie have no confidence in them. It is in the charaoter not of a privilege that the British inhabitants so tenaciously cling to the exemption from these jurisdictions, in cases in which not mere fines are involved, bat the life, or liberty for long terms, or character and social existence of the accused, is concerned. The British inhabitants only desire justice and fair trials, and they claim these in the Suplrebme Cou,rtbecause there only can justice and a fair
In order to satisfy their lordships of the condition of India and of the unsatisfactory manner in which the present machinery of Government worked, he would refer them to a witness whose evidence was above suspicion-Mjr. Halliday, the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal. That gentlemgan thus described the condition of the Bengalese:_
"For a long series of years complaints have been handed down from administration to administration regarding the badness of the Mofussil police under the Government of Bengal, and as yet very little has been done to improve it. Throughout the length and breadth of the land the strong prey almost univerWsally upon the weak, and power is but too commonly valued only as it can be turned into money. It is a lamentable but unquestionable fact that the raral police, its position, character, and stability, as a publc institution, lave in the lower provinces deteriorated during the last 20 year The criminal judicatories certainly do not command the confidence of the people. Whether right or wrong, the general native opinion is certainly that the administration of criminal justice is little better than a lottery, in which, however, the best chances re with the criminal; and this i3 also verymuch the European Mofuasil community."
It had been stated by members of the mercantile community mInndiathat, in consequence of the loose manner in which lov zvaw adminlstered,i 5t took 20 or 30 years to realize the prefit wvhichmight be easilyrmade i five or six years if lawvand orderwere properly maintained. A planter in
"In consequence of this want of law in the country the planters suffer immenso losses. In short, sO far from the Company having aidedthe planters by its government, it has done nothing but increase the facility of their ruin; and the would have createda hundred times more commerce in Inuia had they not been hampered by the existing s
They now run enormous risks, and make in 20 to 30 years as much profit as they would make in five years with perfect ease if there were any law or order in the country, such as is found in every other civilized country. From want of it their loss of capital each year is at a rate which would not be credited in England. I myself have lost tur:ng the pasbyear 2,o00. in debts, which have been accumulating
for three years, from the impossibility of obtaining redress in the Company's courts, I never dreamt for a moment of seekng y rmed inthelawcouts;that would have only increased mny less.."
-Mr. Mackenzie confirmed this statement, and said that he had in his own case abandoned bonds and debts to the amount of a las of rupees-l10,00ol. Hle (the Marquis of Clanricarde) considered that the chief causes of these evils were the system of double government aud the manner in which the patronage of the East Nidia Company had been exercised. It was true that the civil serVIce was now thrown open to public competition, and that appointments were given to persons who passed a precribed examination; but he wished to know what measures had been adopted to insure the qualification of young men of 20 years o age, who were appointed to judicial offices, and who decided questions affecting not only the property but the lives of the native population. This system was defended on the ground that out of 140,000,000 of natives not one could be found who was fitted to fill an office of real responsibility; but the truth was that the system upon which India was governed tended to de de the natives, and to render them cnnning, sordid, and deceitful. If the natives were treated as friends and allies, and employed in the public services, as had been recommended by some of the greatest men who had been in India including the Duke of Wellington, they would be found to be valuable servants and faithful friends. The 3fahomedan. conquerors found no difficulty in admiistrin
govAernment, combined with justice towvards thu nabire 'gf
India. Bnt, instead of acting upon that principle, the very Opposte system was adop even in the army, and howy could it be expected that the natives of India should be contented with British rule when that rule rested upon a base which no E1nglishman could justify ? Within the last few days he saw in a newspaper that there was a question of removing two European regiments to the Persian Gulf; but it was found to be impossible, because if that were done the sepoys would be left without control and witheut a suffioient number of European officers. He
however, would suggest that the people who in former times furnished not only large armies but able officers could be relied uponagain to supply nento whoma we might entrust command. At present those men were condemned almost to the ranks, and could not rise beyond the grade of soubahdar-equivalent to captain; but, even then, a native captain was inferior to the yolngest ensign fresh from college in this country, How was it possible to depend upon the fidelity of an army thus constituted ? He would abstain from reading extracts from the works and correspondence of the most eminent Indian authorities, including Sir T. Munro, leountstuart Elphinstone, and Lord Metcalfe - but they all concurred that native Indians might and ought to be employed in the public service, and attached to it by the hope of honours and rew gs. lf, however, such a plan were to be tried, the vhiofrAnglo Indian press and community would b in arms?" He had heard that in one of the Presidencies the, Governor wished to appoint a native to an o e in the uncovenanted service as secretary, but the whole civil aervice rose in abody, and the Governor wasforced to forego his intention. He (the Marquis of Clauricarde) repeated that
should be made. He did not profess to have prepared any plan, neither was-he boud to Prpound one; but he was certain that'it *vould not be difcalt to draw up a plan which should be a vast improvement upon the present system. If there were tobe, as there ought to be, anIndian Council, he couldnot see why there should not bea Secretary of State for India, instead of leaving matters to a los of old gentlemen, receiving o01M. per annum eatc, elected. by a constituency which had nothing to do with India, 2nd retiring by a system of rotation the most monstrous ever introduced. By that system, as' soon as a man had imbibed official habits and acquired a knowledge of business which rendered him a valuable offi-
cial he was removed simply, because he had acquired expeo-' r:ence by a certain number of years' service. ateod not trouble their lordships further, but would leavo them to decide upon the reception they would give to his resolution, being, however, convinced that, whatever that decision mighbt be, the resolution was in complete accordance with public opinion of this country, and he was sure that Parliament would soon, to use the words of his resolution, decide that the present machinery and system of the Indian Government required amendment. The noble marquis concluded by movin' that the sSstem under which the oen ment of H2er ASajesty's territories is administered is no longer suitable to the condition and prospects of that vast empire or the development of its resources and the improvement and welfare of its inhabitanAts. m
The Dake of ARGYLL remindled the House -that in the discusions which took place in previous sessions regpecting India the question was whether the renewal of the government of 'hat country should be for a term of years or until such period as Parliament should think fit to change it. lrpou-thoese occasions it had keen argaed by some that it would be best that the government of India should be settled from time to time, because that plan would compel the public men of this country at stated periods to reoconsider the whole question, and brought the collected intellect of Parliament to bear upon it. Upon the other hand it was argued that the excitement which from time to time prevailed upon the occasion of the renewal of those discussions was not a healthy excitement, and that during the interval the attention of Parliament was almost whoLy withdrawn from India, and even the little attention that was given related rather to organic changes than to those practical measures by which alone the country could bebenefitted. Without deciding which of those tivo views was' the soundest, he (the Duke of Argyll) would point out that the noble marquis had adopted a plan which possessed the disadvantages of both and the advantages of neither. The noble marquis, giving only some 10 days' notice had proposed, not a practical remedy for a real evil, nor even had he made out any definite case respecting any particular evil buxt ho had proposed an abstract resolution condemning the whole system of Indiau government as rotten from top to bottom. The noble marquis, however, during his whole speech had failed in laying any clear or logical ground for so' tremendous a charge. Ie (the Duke of Argyll) would not be betrayed into following the noble marquis into details, but would rather direct the attention of the House to a consideration of how far the evils which he had pointed out arose from the structural sstem of the Indian Government. The noble marquis. had mentioned' several times the term " double government," and appeared to regard it as a source of evil; gut it would be remembered that the double government of India had borne two out of three different and distinct meanings. The term was first applied to the system under which the East India Company administered the government of Bengal, not in their own, but in the names of the native princes from whom they derived their authority. Subsequent to the Regulation Act, between that period and 1833, double government meant the government, partly commercial, by a commercial company. It was then urged, as he thought with justice, that a chartered company acting solely with a view to its own interests, was not a fit body to govern a great empire. That system had since been changed, and a very different mode of government adopted. It had been admitted on all hands, even by those most opposed to the government of the East India Company, that the change in the character of the company had been beneficial to India. (Hear, hear.) When, therefore, his noble friend said that the total change which had taken
lace in the constitution of the company had made the YNian Government still more ridiculous, he (the Duke of Argyll) contended, on the other hand, that the absurdity, if such there were, was only in name, and that the actual result of the change had been to make the government of India still more effective. He would ask hAs noble friend to define a little more clearly in his own mind than he had done in his speech what he now meant by a system of double government. It had been suggested, and much debated on previous occasions in that House, that we should govern India directly in the name of the Crown. He was very far from depreciating the great importance of that question, Inl813, forexample, itwaslargelydebated, and Lord Grenville, in one of his remarkable speeches, argued with great power the use of the direct government in the name of the Crown, but that direct government was aso ciated witth the abandonment of a company connected with commercil em pire, andassociatedalso with another question which was no longer an element in the consideration at the present day. It was now notorious over the whole of Europa that India was held in trust for the Crown, and that any artempt to injure- or encroach upon our domimon there would be resisted by the whole power of the EnDglish Government and the country at large. He did not deny that there were very important considerations attached to this question. His noblo friend oppodte (the Earl of EUenborough) durming the debate of 1853, alsO urged thst the name of the company should be abolished, and that India should be governed directly in the name of the Crown; but his noble friend added, they might effect that change wit comparative ease; they were withdrawing the patronage of the company to a great extent, and there neea be no organic change, and, indeed, no change whatever, except a change of men. He (the Duke of Argyll) was far from wishing to underrate the importance of those considerations; but, at the same time, he thought he might safely submit to the judgment and opinion of that House that the change then recommended by the noble earl was not one which could effect that total alteration of system which would be required to satisfy the argument of the noble marquis who had brought the subject under their lordships' consideration. There was another point of great importance connected with the question ofchange of system, and that was that the Government of India should be more responsible to the Parliarnent of England. (Hear, hear.) He gathered from his noble friend (the Marquis of Clanricarde) that he attached great weight to that consideration, for he asked, after enumerating some of the evils arising, as he contended, from the present system of administration " Could these things have happened if there had been a Minister who was not shielded by any intermediate body?" Did his noble friend propose that the Government of India should be conducted by an English Minister, not ass sted by any intermediate body? At present, whatever complaints might be made of acts done or omitted to be done in India, the complainant had a right to go to the President of the Board of Control and tell him ke was vested by Parliament with almost complete power over the Court of Directors and over the people of India, and was therefore resonsible for the evils of which complaint was made. That being so, he (the Duke of Argyll) would ask his noble friend if he was prepared to vest that great power over the Government oflndia in the President of the Board of Control withoat the action of any intermediate bodiy (Hear, hear.) He paused for a reply. He saw the nobe marqns admitted that *fhere must be an intermediate body. He (the Duke of Argyll) then asked how such a body was to be consttuted. Wis itto be a council of independent men, intimately connected with the Government of India, to assist the President of the Board of Control in his deliberations ? If that were sb' they could not help such a council coming under the description of " an intermediate body," for that was inherent in the circumstances under which it would be placed. Then it came to this. Was the present mode of electing the council the best? He freely admitted if they had to inaugurate a new mode of eection that the present theory would be indefensible. The council was elected by a constituency, many of whom, his noble friend said, might be old women or lunatics ; but, without goingth.at far, he (theDukeof Argyll)admitted that constituency was composed of persons who had no immediate or necessary connexion with India; and the only answer he could give was that, although he would not abandon the system solely because it was not such as their lordships would start with from the beginning if they had the system of Government to settle anew, still, if they could trace up to the mode of electing that Court any great practical evils, they ought to alter the con stitution of it at once. Before he left that part of the question he wished to remind their lordships of the potion in which they now stood as respected imperial legislation. In 1853 very important changes were made in the structure of the Government of India. First of all, they diiminished very largely the total number of the Indian Council-he thought from 24 to 18. That was, perhaps, no very important change in itself; but there was another, one of very great moment, because it Introduced the principle of election nominally by the Crown. Their lordships had therefore taken a step in the direction which his noble frind th Maqus o Clnrcare)had recommended; but, even asregards 3 thatprinciple,thechange would not come into fullo rtion for some years and he (the Duke of Argyll} wrould ask whether,.since the last settlement of the question by Parliament, anyeventhad happened to indue thir ordaips o mke ay aleraionmthe rmode

He was told that a motion had been. made in the other-House for the production of the papers, and in that case their lordships would be able to come to a satisfactory conclusion on the whole subject. In the meantime he- might say that tho refusal to issie *.a commission to inquire into these evils was very much upon the ground adopted in this House the other night in reference to the proposal for a select committee on secondary punishments. The answer of the Governor-General was not "Tbhis s a question which we wish to hush up and cooceaL" What he said was, "This is no time for inquiry t,7i is the time for action;" and he (the Duke of Argylli believed that remedial measures were now in process of being considered by the Legislative Council of lndia in refe-
rence to the laud tenure of Bengal, the state of the police, - and the administration of ti When
'hinch he referred were laid befor their lodhphen th Iagh that, insteadof throwing doubt and distrust on the existing system, it would afford hope for believing that that system -was likely to work welL He shoold be reluctant to follow the noble marquis through some of the points referred to by him, which were not very relevant to the question in
an. It might be that the Government in India had made great mistake4 that there were great evils in connexcon 'with that Government; but, at aU events, under the existing system there was a Minister responsible for all such faults as could be directly traced to the action of Government. The real fact, however, was
that neither his noble friend who had just spoken nor any, other mnan had been able to lay his fingers upon any acknowledge evils and to bring the 'responsibihtY home to that Minister. And why? enbl eybhad not`the detailed information necessary to enable them to cope with this question, and because the proportion of men in Parlia. mentcompetentto deal with such dificullt points as the lnd revenue or the administration of justico in the various provinces of India would be always a very small one. With regard to the question of finance, his noble friend found great fault with the statement made in his minute by the
arquis of Dalhousie as to the outlay upon public works. Now, there might possibly be discrepancies in the figures laid before Parliament, but on this point he might remark that there was always considerble doubt as to the items which should be included in these papers. It was certain, however, that the expenditure oDn extraordiinary public works had been in 1854-5 veynarly 2,000,0001. the eWsmates for 1855-6 awere ahbout 2oooO atougi the average exenditueithswyfo 185-1 to 185 was only 719,0001. T hedeficiencyn the revenue of India was caused, if not entirely, yet in a great measure, by the expenditure upon the public works. He meant by public works such works as the Ganges Canal and the irrigation works in Madras ad Bombay. It was stated that a large annual deficiency must ad would continue to appear unless the Government should nnhappilychange its present policy and abandon the duty which it owed to the Eian empire Thus they might expect not only to *ee a deficiency in the revenue during the last two years, but if the present system of policy were persevered m there would probably be a deficiency for some years to come, The noble marquis had referred to the very large war expenditare Incurred by the Indian Government; but it was only fair to give the reply of the Court of Directors when such a charge was made-namely, that this war expenditure was frequently due to the direct action of the responsible ad. vsers of the Crown. His noble friend had talked about the acquisition of territory In India by conquest. Now, for 1umself, he (the Duke of ArgyU) believed, looking to the stringent provisions introduced by Parliament into its Acts on the subject of India, in order to prevent aggession against the native Powers, that we had come to our vast empire in India from no orginal idea of conqest, but from tho force of circumstances, and from that which his noble friend near him (the Earl of Clarendon) caled "the destiny of natione,
-an expression go mach quoted by the Americans. He also believed that a great number of the wars for the expenditare upon which the Indian Government was held responsible ha been ued upon that Government by the advisers of the Crown, an4 where that was not the case, by the Govemnors-Goneral of India, who were English statesmen sent out by the home authorities, and operating to a great extentt independently of the Board of Directors. He was unwilling to detain the House long, and the miore so as he felt there was no question before it. 'His noble friend couldi hardly haveoimagined that this resolution could beadopted;and th condition of the House at that moment (there wer
not more than a dozen peers present) was an indcation of the snial amount of interest whch it had excited. While however, he was not dispoeed to enter into the questions of letail referred to by his noble friend, he would aluade for a moment to that part of his speech in which his noble friend had referred so many of the evlls of India to the administrv tion of the Compan's civil service. The whole of thatior tion of his noble ftiendAs remarks ha reference to a state of things which. to a grest extent bad ed away. It could
no longer be said that the evil of In M 'ere attributable to
the patronage exercised by the Court of Directors with regard to the civil service. The civil service of Indi had been thrown en to all the subjects of the Crown, and it wAs ogical and absurd now to charge the system of double government with the results of appointments to this service. Then his noble friend had referred to the imperfect mode in which the examinations were conducted. Well, that was a mnatter directly under the control of Parliament. The Board of Contro was bound to lay before Parliament every year the roles and regulations connected with this subject, and a few days ago he had, on the part of his right hon. friend (Mr Vernon Smith), laid this paper on their lordships' table. If his noble friend? therefore, saw any defect in the presnt systemofexaminationlet himbringthatsubjectpractieany before the House, Instead of asklng its assent to an abstract resolution which was utterly without any reasonable foundation, Before sitting do byho was anxons to offer one eRneral cavec to the obsrtions of his noble friend.
should be sorry if anything which he had said should seem to depreat, or to tend to deprecate, discussion upon the Affairs of India in the Britis Parliament; but those discusjions ought not to be taken u abstract resolutions, but upon substantive goars. When he considered the tremendous power wield by the Government of India, and how great a pressue that Government might lml?ose pon the people vtheadoptionof any erronous rinciple either of finance or of judica administration, he ft how narr owly the British Parliament ought to watch their proceedinas; and ho must repeat that, in such a case, he did not tbii that practcal good was to be effected by abstract resolutions.
The motion was then withdrawn.
The Hlouse adjourned at 10 minutes to 8 o'clock.

REFORM OF THE CORPORATION OF LONDON.
Mr. HANKEY asked when the Secretary of State for the Home Department intended to proceed with the Bill for the reform of the corporation of London?
Sir G. GREY.-There are two reasons that have prevented me from askng for leave tointroduce thisBill. The firEt is that I have recently received a communication from the Lord Mayor, informing me that certain resolutions connected with the subject were under the consideration of the Court of Common Council, which he was anxious I should see before my Bill was introduced. I requested that he would transmit them to me as eawly as possible, and I received them yesterday. Independently of this, the state of public business affords no prospect that we shall be able to proceed with this Bill for several weeks, and there has therefore been no delay. I will take the earliest opportunity of asling for leave to bring in a Bill after I have considered these resolutions.
coNVICTs IN BRITISH GuINA.
hMr. LIDDELL wished to know whether it was true that, sn consquence of a resolution passed by the Combined Court, a communication was addressed by the Governor of British Guiana to Her Majesty's Colonial Secretary in June last on the subject of receiving convicts from this country; and, if sO, whether tlhere was any objection to lay a copy of such correspondence on the table of the House.
Mr. LABOUCB ERE said it was true that the Iegislature of British Guiana had been consideringwhether a penal establishment could be made available in that colony for convicts from other parts of the West Indies, and also from this country. The Governor of British Guians stated that in his opinuon, although a penal settlement might be made available in thst colony for convicts from the other West Indian colonies, he could not propose that it shorld be made available for convicts from thiscountry. This was an opinion in which ho heartily concurred, and he had read with great satisfaction the announcement by the Emperor of the French that the French Governmnent intended to withdraw their convict establishment from Cayenne, on account of the frightful mortality that had occurred there. With regard to the papers there would be no objection to produce them if the hon. gentleman thoughe proper to move for their publIceation.
FEES OF COUNTY ORFICERS (IRELAND).
Mr. J. FIZGERALD, in answer to Captain ARCHDALr, said that the question of the fees of county officers in Ireland was a question of law,and not one for the consideration of the Government. His own opinion with regard to some of the fees of the clerks of the Crown was that the
were illegaL Other legal authorities, on the other hand, thought dlfferently. The origin of some of these fees was lost in the remoteness of time, and there was great diffi
culty with respect to their legality. The question must be decided in the superior courts. Any one. who was aggrieved by the exaction of these fees could institute an action and an indictment for extortion; but this was not a question for the Government, but for the individual
HOSTILITIES Nt CENTA.
Lord C. HrA-MITTON wished to ask Her Majesty's Government whether any orders or instructions haa been issued to the British authorities at Hongkong, or to the admiral in command of the squadron inthe Chinese waters, suspending or superseding the directions grven bv Earl Grey inNovember, 1847, whereby offensive operations against the Chincse wereperemptorily forbidden without previous sanction from thlscountrya*nd, if any such order had been sent, w hether thby would lay a copy of the same on the table of the House.
Mr. LABOUCHERE.-No instructions relating to this subject have been sent to Hongkong subsequent to the date of the papers to which the noble lord has referred.
AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS.
Mr. BLAKEMORE asked the Vice-President of the Board of Tradeo whether it was the intention of the Govemment to introduce any measure this session for the collecting of agricultural statistics; nd, if so, whether it would comprehend any regulation for the measure in bushels or gallons, or the weight in pounds, whereby the sde and purchase of wheat and other grain shall be compulsorily ied; and also whether it would contain any regulations whereby the quantities and average prices of wheat and other _rain sold ithe various counties of England and Wales should be more correctly ascertained.

Mr. BAXTER asked the Under Secretary for War what steps had been taken to gve effect to the resolution passed by the House on the 7th day of April, lo56-namely,
"That in the opinion of this Hlouse the practice of billetin soldiers of the militia, and of the line, in Scotland, upon private famlies, Is ijuarious to the comfort and discipline of
hemen, as well as oppressive to the people, and that it is the duty of the Government to take means to abolish the grievance,."
Mr. PEEL saidthatthepowerof billeting soldiers was given unuder the Mutinty A ct. It wvas his intention to introduce a change in that power under the Mutiny Act of the coming year. As soon as the number of men were voted for the army he should bring in this Bill, and if his hon. friend would wat until then he would find an answer to his | ~~THE RESOLUTE.
Mr. EVELYN asked the First Lord Of the Admiralty whether it was true (as stated in the public journals) that the Arctic vessel the Resolute (though not ordered to be broken up) had been stripped and dismantled and placed in ordinary; and whether he had any objection to state what was the present condition of this vessel, given as it was by the American people to the Queen of England.
Sir C. WOOD.-The hon. member must be aware that it is not the practice to keep vessels faul rigged or manned except they are fitting for service. The Resolute is in the same state as all other vessels that are not intended for immediate service. A great part of the stores are not in a state to be kept, the only exception being the rum, w hich has been improved by so long a voyage.
SUJRREY COUJNTY LUJNATIC ASLYUM.t
MIr. OTWAY said that St would bein the recollection of the House that a lunatic confined in the Surrey County Lunatic Asylum was recently subjected to certain treatment and died in 20 minutes afterwards. The medical officer, 3ir. Snape, was committed for trial, but the Grand Jury iguored the bill, and Mr. Snaps had been re-appointed to the medical charge of the asylum by the visiting committee of magistrates. He wished to ask the Home Secretary whether he bad the power upon the appointment or re-appointment of such an officer to remove him; * nd, secondly, whiether he had signified his disapprobaho~n of the re-appoimtment of Mr. Snaps. He also wished to know whether the right hon. baronet would lay npon the table the corres,pondence between the Commnissioners of Lunacy, the visting maglstrates, and the Home-of fice.
Sir G. GRWEY saidthat after the occurrence adverted tothe medical officer was umpeded during the inquiry and p rosecution. He behieved that he was not dismissed, and that there had strictly been no re-appointment, but that after the inquiry the committee of visiting iustices recommended that the suspension should cease. The Secretary of State for the Home D)epartment bad no power as to theap pointment or dismissal of the medical officer of a lunatic asylum, that power being entirely vested by the Act of Parliament in the visiting committee. He had received a statement from the Lunacy Commissioners on the subject, whi ch he had transmitted to the visiting committee, and he had also received a communication from the visitinz committee in reply, which he had transferred to the L;unacy
Commissioners. There would be no objection to the pro. duction of this correspondence,
Mr. DRUMMOND hoped that the papers would include Mr. Snape's statement, and also copies of the medical evidence taken by the visiting magistrates,
Sir G. GREY said, if the hon. gentleman (Mr. Otway( would make a motion for the production of the papers the hon. member for West Surrey could add the papers to which he had referred to that motion. If he could procure the papers he would produce them.
THE SOUND DUES.
Sir J. GRAHA3L-I wish to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether Her Majesty's Government has come to an agreement with the Government of Denmark respecting the comuatation of the Sound Dues; and whether Parliament in the present session will be invited to provide the sum necessary for such commutation ?
Lord PALM1ERSTON.-Her Majesty's Government has for a long time been ia comniunication with the Danish Government, and other Governments of Europe, on the subject of the Sound Dues. No arrangement has yet been come to on the subject, but I hope that some arrangement wial shortly be made, and in that case we shall have to submit to Parliament the provisions necessary for carrying it into effect.
SAXINGS-BANKS.
Dr. MICHELL asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether 3r. Tidd Pratt had certified the savings-banks deferred annuity tables?
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCE UEM suad ilie nsglstrar of friendly socities had to revise the rules -of avvnsbanks,but he had no ooncern with their tbles. Those tables were prepared by the actuiary of Uie savings banks departmzent, and subnntted by the direction of the statute for the approval of the Lords of' the Treasury, and
the anproval of tho Lords of the Treasary vas then publishod in the London GaOct. That was the the pubc had invariably been followed, e course whch * ENDOWED SCEHOOLS COMMISSION.
Lord NAAS asked the Chief Sezretary for Ireland when the report of the Endowed Sehools Comninjion was likely to be presented to Parliament; and whether it was the intention of the Government to propose any measure on that subject in the present session ?
Mr. HORSMAN could not say exactly, when the repor4 wonld be laid upon. the table, bat when he left Debhim in January the commi3ssioners had terminated theis-inquiries and were deliberating apon their report.

w r. Ls YARD.-I wish to ask tbe noble lord at the head of the Government a question of which I was unable to give hila notice, as I have only to-day received the information upon which it is feunded. The question is wvhether a treaty was signed between Rassia and Persih on the 5th of Januarylast, and ratified at Teheran on the 18th of the same month, by which Persia ceded to Russia certain territory between two places on the frontiers of Tnrkey ?
Lord PALME STON.-Her Majesty's Government have*; no knowledge of any such treaty, excoept from what has a.ppeared in the newspapers.
THE BUDGET.
Lord J. RBUSSELL.-The right hon. gentleman opposite has given notice of an amendment to the motion which the Chanoellor of the Exchequer is to make to-morrow. I wish to know whether the right horr. gentleman intends to propose his amendment upon the question of going into Committee of Ways and Means, or after we have gone into committee?
Mr. DISRAELI.-I intend to propose the amendment in the manner in which I have given notice of- itrA the paper-namely, on the question that the SpeakerXdo leave the chair.
THE PERSIAN EXPEDmON.
Mr. GLADST01NE.-I wish to ask the President of the Board of Control when we are likely to have two papers laid before us connected with the Persian expedition, but unconnected with the negotiations now in progress? I mean -first, the instructions from the GCovernment under -which a military expedition vas sent to Persia; and, secondly, the corregpondence between the Governmentand the East India Company as to the mode in which the charges of the Per. sian war are to be borne.
Mr. V. SMITH was understood to say that there would be no objection to produce a portion of the papers immediately. His right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer had stated the nature of the arrangement with the East India Company.
Mr. GLADSTONE.-Is there any objection to state the date of the instractions to which I have referred ? (Hear, hear.)
No answer was returned to this question, and it was repeated by Mr. GLAmSTONr, when
Mr. V. SMITH said,-The instructions for sending a military and naval expedition into the Persian gulf were dated December 26.
Mr. H. BAILLIE.-I ask the right hon. gentleman whether instructions for fitting out an expedition to the Persian gulf were not issued in the middle of July last; whether they did not reach Bombay on the 20th of August, and whether transports were not taken up and other pre. paratlons made for the expedition on the receipt of those instractions? (Hear, hear.)
Mtr. V. SMITHL-Provisional orders were sent to the Government of India to make preparations in case an exp3dition should be necessary, but final instructionsforthe expedition were not sent until the date I have mentioned.
REGISTRATION OF CHINESE VESSELS.
Mr. J. L. RICAR;DO asked the Secretary for the Colonies whether he would lay on the table Ordinance No. 7 of 1I86, with regard to the registration of Chinese boats.
Mx. LABOUCEERE said, if the paper had not already been presented, he would make inquiries about it and produce it.
COUN TFRANCEISE.
Mr. L. KIG then rore to move for leave to introdace a Bilto make the franchise in counties in England and Wales the same as that in boroughs, by giving the right of voting to all occupiers of tenements of the annual value of 101. The hon. and learned gentlman said that when the noble lord tho member for London withdrew his Reform Bil in 1854 he stated that he should bring it forward on a future occasion; but, considering the distance from the Treasmuy bench of the seat which the noble lord now occupied, he thought there was not much probability of the speedy introduction of that BilL He had therefore prepared a Bill, which carried out the great constitutional principle that taxation and representation ought to go together. He hoped the noblo boid at the head of the Governmrint would take this opportunity of making some declaration of his views on the subject of reform. He felt that the only way to deal with this great question was to treat all cases with equal justice. Loet the franchise be fixed at whatever point might be deemed right, and let it be so fixed for all; but let not the inhabitants of one place be endowed with electoral rights which were refused to the inhabitants of another part. The case which he submitted to the House appeared very strong, if the unrepresented towns were compared with the represented towns. There were very large unrepresented towns, p
learned institutions and a considerable amount of trade ana commerce, and yet the occupying tenants in those towns possessed no vote, unless they paid a rent of nDwards of
a- *year, while in certain small agricultural boroughs, possessing no learned institutions, and with scarcely any trade, every inhabitant paying a rent of 101. had a vote. Then, with regard to the rural districts, a house situated in a country part, for which a rent of 201. or 40g. was paid, was a very good house. The person living in itmight have a very goodincome, and contribute * good dealboth to the direct and indirect taxes. Still that person might have no vote; -while another person living in a borough, in a smaller houses would be entitled to vote at elections. The hon. member here quoted statistical accounts for the purposo of showin'
that smce 1841 the number of county electors had decreassa as compared with the borouigh voters in proportion to the population; and he also contended that, taking propertyv as a test, the counties ought to have more voters than they possessed at present. l'he noblo lord the member for Loudon, on a former occssion, referred to the distinction which bad always existed between the county and the borough franchises, but he thought he need not now reply to that objection of the noble lord, as the noble lord answered it himself in the suggested extension of the county franchise, whisk the noble lord iaa submitted to the House. He hoped the House would allow him to bring in the bill, and that it would deal with it, not considering the gain it might produce to one side or to the other, but simply regarding it as a measure of justice. The hon. member then moved for leave to bring in the bil.
Lord PALMERSTON.-I hope my hon. friend will not think I act discourteously towards him if I should not be disposed to accede to the introduction of the proposed bil
(hear, hear); for, independently of the objections which I should have to urgo to the measure itself, I shoald think, from the business which the House is likely to have before it in the course of the present session, that there is very little probability of a measure of this sort passing into alaw. (Hear, hear.) Therefore it would be saving the time and labour of the House not to enter into the discussion of a subject of such great magnitude without a fair prospect of pursuing it to an end. I own I cannot agree with my hon. friend in the principle which forms the foundation of his proposal-namely, that there should be an identifica. tion of the right of voting in boroughs and counties, and I concur in what has fallen from my noble friend the member for London, that there has always been a distinction, and it is important to maintain it, between the right of voting in boroughs and in counties. The two great classes of electors represent different interests in the community, and the prindples on which their rights of voting have always stood have been of a different character. But what would be the logical consequences of adopting the principle of my hon. friend and of identifying the right of voting in counties and boroughs? Why, to sweep away all boroughs; because, if the right of voting in counties and boroughs were identical, upon what ground could you main. tain the existing artificial distinctions between them? I therefore object both to the principle of his bill and to the
consequences which, in my opinion, would inevitably attend
it. In stating this I beg my hon. friend to understand that I do not mean to say that there should be noextension what. ever of the franchise in counties. I think that tho measure which was proposed on a former occasion by my noble friend the member for the city of London, by which the qualification- for a county franchise would have been made to tally with that of a juryman, is such as I should not be disposed to object to. My hon. friend would not approve such a measure, because his proposal prevents him; and there are many other advocates of Parliamentary reform who would say, " You are a bit-by. bit reformer, but we are for great and comprehensive measures." Now, I confess that in matters of this sort Ilm
not for great and comprehensive measures, There wa undoubtedly a necessity for measures of that character in 183t and 1832. The public mind had fixed itself upon a long continuance of abuses which required some great and xweeping remedy. The same tate of things does not now exist. Oa r c onstitution has grown up gradually bf7e e correction of evils as they happen to occur. I think that in these matters it is much safer to see one's way, and to takO one step at a time. Ifameasure ppears to be reqired by the cndition of things, adopt it, and watch its effects; bu s
dc not go b eyond tho point t that you wish to arrive at. I bope tar hon. frie'ni will not suppose that, becamse I Cannot eonu with his rfiotion, I am therefore one of those who set
at y i mprovement of o ur r epresentative ystem. I object to the particular mseasre whichhe pro. poses. I do not;think:thait there is any likelihood of suchha ineasnro pa.si'ik the present state of public a fairs aad, sasgtat many ine sar nes ' of important improvement s ate

Bikely to come umder discussion which will occupy a very coniderable part of the present sesion, I should certainlr advse theHouse not toconsent totbe introduction of theBill of my hon. Triend, which is obectionablein princle, nd 'bicb, even if ii wete not, vould have very little chance of yrssirg this session. ("Hear, hear," and "Divide!")
Mr. E.ADLAX did not think that the noble lord had Faid anything 'Which should induce him to declie that support which he had given on former oc3sions to the Bill. (Hear, hear.) With respect to the noble lord's objection to the introduction of the Bill, on the pound of the multiplicity of business already before the liouse, he must say that he could not recollect a ses ion which, at its commencement, presented so little prospects as the present of the House being overwhelmed 'with business. And, as to the noble lord's objection to the Bill on constitutV( nal grounds, he thought the fact that the qualification for a county franchise was merely a 40s. freehold, while that for aborough was formerly even greater than it was at present, .howed that the proposed extension of the oounty franchise would be quite in harmony with the principles of the constitution. He thought that the 101. householdeswere the least dangezous class of the people, and that the inhabitants of such plac as Birkenhead, Bamsley, and many other towns which were unrepresented in Parliament, ought to be permitted at least to vote for county membes.
hlr. DRUMMOND had always been an advocate for tho extension of the franchise. Ile disliked the Reform Bill from head to toe, as he never could understand tho reason why Parliament insisted on a money qualiication of voters -while the ualiftcation for a seat in that House was virtually abolled. Nor could he ever understand why the renting of a 101. house should be held to be a test of poUtical morality. The objections which had been made to this bill would always be made to every bil that might be proposed. He wanted the franchise to be extended to the very lowest classes, that they might protect themselves against that tyranny of the classes over them which we saw so constantly exhibited, and of which he should shortly have another occasion of speaking. But let theHousjsktcontent. Therewould benoreform,but there would be plenty of truisms about it. There would be no reform measures until those who now occupied the seats on the Ministerial sidv of the House were sent to the Opposition benchee, and then we should have plenty of them. (Langhter.)
Lord J. RUSSELL. -The proposition, of my hon. friend has been met by my noble friend at the head of the Government with two objections; the first relating to the state of public business, and the second to the principle of the propodstion. Now, as to the first of these objections, I do not think that the Government ought to allege that there iceot be time this session for the discussion of this bill. (Hear, hear.) There must, no doubt, be considerable discussion upon the budget, but the propositions of the Chancellor of the Exchequer are very simple, and when we have decided upon one or two points the rest of them may be said to be disposed of. As to the measures introduced by the Government, I must say that they are of such a character as to induce me to suppose that they are not inclined to undertake measures of very great difculty and importance. The Secretary of State for the Home Department was asked whether the Governmnent meant to introduce any measure with regard to church-rates, and he replied in the negative. The right hon. baronet the member for Droitwich (Sir J. Pakington) yesterday introduced, on his own responsibility, a measure with respect to which he has taken great pains, and which refers to one of the most important subjects now discussed in this country-that of education; but we had no hint from tho Government that it was their iutention to propose any measure upou that subject, or in any way to interfere with the course of the right hon. baronet. This very night a question was put concerning a subject which has excited, perhaps, more agitation than it ought-viz,, that of agricultural statistics, but even with regard to that the Government are not prepared to legislate, and refrain from disturbing the placid course of events. Therefore, so far as public business is concerned, it seems to me that we shall have ample time to discuss a measure of so simple a character as that proposed by the hon. member for East Surrey. (Hear, hear.) Then I come to the question itself. The hon. member bas very truly said that I upon former occasions mado objections to hiis measure; but I think he did not mention that into the last Reform Bill > hich I laid upon the table of this House I introduced the very proposal which he bas now submitted to us. (Rlear, hrar) In fact I found that the objection which I made, end vwhich I think co,uld be maintained so far as relates to < ur ancient constitution-viz, that the franchise in counties was a franchise by' tenure, 'while that in borougbs was a franchise by rating-that that ground was completely taken away by the consequences of an amendment-which
a,D is,troduced into the Reform Bill by the present Duke of Buckingham, and which introduced occupancy as a qualification for county voters. (Hear, hear.) I was afraid of adding to that description of independent voters %ho were introduced, I think most unfortunately, by a mnjz rity of this House against the arguments of Lord Althorpe and those whowere bringing forward the bill; but I find upon inoniry that, so far from adding to tho dependert voters, the occupiersof 101., 201., and 301. houses in counties consist very much of persons of independent means livibg in sniall houses which have not the right of sending iLembers to Parliament, and therefore, instead Of injuring, tbey would improve the constituent bodies in countios. There is this, besides, to consider, and now I am going to touch somewhat -pon the larger question. I have myself bad the honour to introduce twice of late years, in 1852 and 1Se4, measures which were considered as the comflements of the Reform Act, which were in conformity with its spirit, but which tended to the introduction of very considerable changes beyond its original sCOpe. I think it may be said-and there are persons who will be ready enough to assert it-that there is no great pressure in the public mind, no national urgency for the adoption of a comprehensive measure of reform. For my own part, I should think it was very imprudent in my noble friend if he were now to say, independently of the general opinion which he has just stated, that it was the intention of the Government to disturb the Legislature and the mind of the country by such a comprehensive measure. But then, Sir, if I admit that to be the case, I cannot repeat the argument which I adduced in opposition to the hon. gentleman (Ar. L. King) on former occasions, when I said that the Reform Act having been enacted by public consent, it was far better that we should not deal with such a subject by driblets, but should consider the whole subject at once, and see'what defects migiht be found and what amendments might be roquirtd On the contrary, I think that, if we sincerely desire reform, the only course now to be pursued is to adopt a measure which is in itself a safe improvement whenever it may be proposed (hear, bear); and I cannot but adr.it that the measure of the hon. gentleman is such an hnprovement. (Hear, hear.) I thlink that no one who is disposed to entrust the elective franchise to the occupants of 101. houses in towns can object to its enjoyment by those who occupy such houses in the country, because the occupant of a 10l. house in the country is generally a person of greater intelligence and more property than is the tenant of a similar house in a borough. It frequently happens that the occupant of a 101. house in a small country town, not returning members to Parliament, would, if he were to remove to this metropolis or to one of our great towns, find that the expenditure of 151. or 201. per annum iwould not place him in so good a house as that which lie had left. I therefore think that thisi change is a safe one, and, seeing that no one is likely to propose a large measure of reform, I am, moreover, of opinion that it will tend to satisfy a large body of persons who have some reason to complain of the existing state of things. In the first place many persons occupying houses of 101. or 2 1. rent in the country nmay fairly say that they are excluded froni the franchise which their neighbours in the borough possers; but, according to the existing arrangement, they may also say, "Here isatown which hasgrownup, w-hich has 10,000. 12,000, or 14,000 inhabitants, but which sends no special representative to Parliament ; but there is a town only fine miles off, which has only 5.000 inhabitants, snd which is made up paitly by the addition of country parisles. It is very bard that that town should have inemcers while that in wvhich we reside has none." If we are not goirg to alter the distribution of seats in this House, that grievance must remain without remedy; but if ymu give to the inhabitants of that town of 12,000 or 13,00) persci- the right of voting for the members for the county their causes of complaint would be greatly diminished, and they would so far bh satisfied that they had at least equal rights with their neighbours. I think, therefore. this measur would tend not only to improve, but also to consolidate our institutions, and to pive further stability to our representative system. Taking this view of the question, I should he prepared not only to vote for the introduction of this Bill, hut also, if it got so far, to sunport the motion for its second reading. (ilear, hear.) - I think the present time is far from being an unpropitious one, for perhaps this year, perbaps next, but certainly before two years have elapsed, we shaU have a general electon of members of this House, and I think it would
greatlyimprorve the constitution of the next Parliament if I sme20,000 or 30.'A0,000 men of property, mnen upon whom you could depend, were added zo the basis upon which the representation stands. (Sear, hear.) I do not know that l ere is any thing to prevent this improvement, and I shill
therefore-wvithout discussidng with the hen. member (ti--
King) the detects of thie measure which Ih
ced-be satisfied to give my support to this bill.
Cbeers.)
Mr. BENTINCK congratulated his hon. friend the nennber for West Surrey (Ur. Drummond) upon the rapif ulflment of his propbecy, for, although the noble lord the
ember for the city of London (Lord J. Russell) was not itting on that (the Opposition) side of the House, he occa.
ied a position which was evidently quite as unpalatable to m self. (A laugh.) It was not his (br. Bentinck's) pro.
ce to defend the gentlemen on the Treasury bench; but hen he heard the noble lord asking those right hon. gentleen why they had not brought forward certain measu-res ich he thought necessary to the welfare of the countrs, o felt tempted to ask the noble lord whetber he woull
vour the Houme with a list of the useful measures ich ho broueht forward and carried during the several arsfor whichW was at the head of the Goveri,ment, and, course, had grery facility for carrying such mcasures if had brought them forward ? Be (Mbr. Bentinek) had no collection of anysuch measures, and should be glad to e a list of them, after the production of which the
rge made by the noble lord would comne with a nch better grAce. Ho believed that the country was oroughlr sik of the word "reform.! (A Isugh.) waS quite t*e, an had been aid by his hon. friend (Ir.
ond), that that word 'was used merely as a piece of p'rap for the purpose of zaising the bad pasions of the norant then eertaln gentlemen were out of place.

t had been aid by the noble lord at tho heAd of the mutest.A, far &s the gneral question 'went,it would

Until the country saw t)sat some real benefit was intended by these schemes of reform aUl these attempts would he regarded snt the light in 'which they deserved to be looked at, and they would not be responded to by the people generally. (Hlear, hear.)
Lord J. RUSSELL.-I cannot now answer the challenge of the hen, gentleman (Mr. Bentiuck), butt I shall be very happy at a future opportunity to state to him the measures which I did introduce. (Chees-s.)
Mlr. T. S. DUNCOUBt said that the observations of the hon. mnemiber for West Norfolk (Mr. Bentinek) were most unjust towards the noble lord (Lord J. Russell). (Hear, hear.) He should have been very much surprised to hear the noble lord state that he should take any other course than that which he had announaced that he was s;bout to prue. In 1854 the noble lord laid upon the table a bill which' he p~artea with on account of the war with great regret (a juh,adinL that' bMl he included the very proposition which was now mnade by his hon, friend the member for East Surrey. (Hear, hear.) Hlis (Mx. Dauncombe's) astonish-
ment was that any member of the Aberdeen Government' should oppose that proposition. (Hear, hear.) There was no doubt great apathy in the country upon the subject of reform; but why was there that apathy ? Because the country knew that the House of Commons was not equal to the emergency. (Hear, hear.) Let Lord Derby's Government come again into office and introduce a bill bringing the operative classes within the pale of the constitution, andl then they would have agitation in its favour to their heart's conitent. But as long as they rejected minor imeasures like this the people wouid not condescend oven to ask them for reform. For his own pat, he only wished that this proposal had gone a great dea fZurthr
When Lord Derby's hinmatry was in power it was held to be of the utmost constitutional im ortanc that the four seats vacant by'disfranchisement sho3do then'ho filled up, and the Government accordingly brought in a Bil giving two additional seats to Lancashire and the other two to Yorkshire. If consistency was to be the order of the day, why was it they heard nothing miore from hon. gentlemen opposite regarding that measure ? Kensington, Brompton, and other outlying districts of the metro polis had no representation, either borough or county, and the man oceupying a 451. house on one side ofrastreethad no vote, whilehis opposite neighbeur, living in a 101. house, had one merely because he accidentally came within the Parliamnentary boundary. To redress that gross injustice this Bill had been introduced, and he should be much surprised if the House threw out a proposition so perfectly rational. (Hear, hear.)
Sir JX. GRAE.AM.-Sir, I would remind the hon. member for FinsbnryandtheJBousegonerany that, on other occasions, when this proposition has been brought forward I have not felt it necessary to obtruLde myself on your attention. And &Ast I must express may regret that the bhon. members for West Surrey (Mr. Drummond) and West Norfolk (Mr. Bentinek) should thus early in this discussion have though' it expedient to import into the debate the imputation of factious motives and personal objects, totally unworthy of any member of this House. Sir, the place where I sit in this House is my own choice, and I, for one, am quite content to remain where I am. (Hlear, hear.) The hon. mnember for West Norfolk says that the noble lordI the member for London has not, in his experie-ace, formerly introduced ira. portant measures advantageous to the country. The hon. member has not long held a seat in this House, hut I have sat here with my noble friend for moro than 30 years, and I have no' forgotten that to him is due the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts-that to him is rmaintly due the Reform Bill of 1832-that to him also is mainly due the introduction of the Poor Law into Irelanid-that we Owe to him likewise the comamutation ,of tithes 'ta Englad to fixed paymients. Indeed, I should Weary the House -were I to go through the entire cataloguLe of what the noble lord has achieved with an ability, a zeal, a fortituide, and a constancy which -rediound to his infinite honour. (Cheers) Sir, if Iceould have re-conciled it with may sense of duty to give a silent vote, I maight well have rested the vote that I intend to give upon the speech of my noble friend. But, having on all former occasions abstained from voting on this p'recise proposition, I think it right
befyto state WhyI shllno offr it my support. (Hear, hear.) Will the House hea with me for a short time while I explaini -what has influenced my conduct up to the present moment with respect to measures of reform? Having in 1832, wvhen t-he ineasure of that year was introduced, announced a strong opinion that that Bill should be viewed as a final settlement of this question, I for a very long
crid resisted furtber change on the ground of finality.
Ertli has been miy fortune to live long enough to ascertain that that ground is wholly unteniable. (Hear, hear) Finality, applied to the work of mnan, is a solecism ina terms. The juxtaposition of the words " human" and "for ever" at once sliows how absurd that doctrine must sooner or later be found. (Rear, hiear.) I certainy was of opiniona that it was expedient, if aniother change was to be introduced, that it should be what has now become almost a byword-a large and comiprehenisive measure. Partly, however, fromi the undeniable apathy of the country on this suabject, and still more fromn the extreme difficulty, considering the extent of the previous alteration, of bring. iag forward another scemere for the second time miaking a great chauge--a maeasure of a comprehenisive character has not yet been successful and is net, in my jukdgment, likely soon to be so. I think, therefore, that that ground is no longer tenable. But I cannot forget that one of the gre-at measures iipon which the Government of Lord Aberdeen was bared was a measure of reform enilarging the franchise. It was so dleclared on the construction of that Ministry; and in the speech from the Throne in 1854 such a measure was recommended in order to give additional stability to the institutions of the country. A Bill having that object was aceordingly framed with great care by the Cabinet of Lord Aberdeena. It was introduced by my noble friend the miemaber for London on behalf of that Cabinet; andl it was withdtrawn on account of the peculiar pressure of war, and of the mneasures cons.quent upon that critical state of things. Now, in that measure wvas included, among many other provisons, the& precise proposition of the hon. member for East Surry.
(Hea, hear.) I admit that the measure also contained ether provisions which might he held to counterhalance the pr t-icular effect of the Bill now sought to he introduced; ;be1t, if there were ceuntervailing provisions as bearing on the couint-y franchise, it must not be forgotten that the scheme of 1854 also lowered the franchise of the towns and cities, and reduced it from a franchise of a 101. rating occupation to a 61. qualification, with a residence of two years and a- half. There were other provisions to wvhich I will very briefly refer- namely, the provison giving effect to a limited extent to the votes of the ininornty; together with the creation of several new franchises. My noble friend has trulY stated that while the county franchise rested upon tenure there would have been grave objections to the introduction of a measure like this. Buttthe Chandos claunse in the Reform Act introduced for the first timie, as hearing on the county franchise, the condit ion of occupation. And though the circumstances of Ireland are, I admit, peculiar, yet day by day the necessity of assimilatin.e in all th1eir great principles, the laws of the3 united kingdom is becoming more and more apparent. Well, with regard to the Irish counties, in 1850 the Legislature deliberately fixed their representation, not on a basis of tenure in the Main, hut on occuPation, placing the right of voting at a county election in Ireland uPon an occupation tenure of 121. Now, I should have the greatest objection to this Bill if I believed it would introduce into the counties of England aYny9riht,of voting suLbject, from its nature, to undue influence in a greater proportion than now exists.I
qite agree with the principle which I think mny noble friend has cited from Mr. Fox more than once-viz., that that is the best system of electing
miembers in a representative government which includes~ the largest number of the independent voters, and exciludes those wbo, from the circumstances of their position, are incapable of indepenident deliberation. The test, theni, which I apply to this proposition is-" Do I believe that it will introduc-e into the coutnties mnen of independent station who ae now shut out,t or whUit extend the suffrage to those wvho crc incapable of inidependent deliberation !',I amn bonund to say my firm conviction is, that it will enlarge the fran. cbise in amanner that is perfectly safe. (Hear, hear.) My Inoble friend now at the head of the Government apprehendsthat if this proposition were adopted there would be a danger of uniform electoral districts, and that only one riglit of voting would prevail in the c~ountry. If I enter. tained any such belief I should come to the same conclusion as my noble friend, and vote against the Bill. But there will alwvays remain the broad distinction between the counties and the boroughs of E-nglamd, that while voting in the boroughsi is confined to occupation, limaited by a 101. renit, mn the counties, on the other hand, even if this measure were passed, the3 prevailing franchise would be based on tenure As low as that of the 40s. freeholder, together with the various leasehold and other tenures now unknown in the cities and boroughs. Then, Sir, I ask myself this quaes. tion-If finality can no lonuger be maintained-if a large and com~prehensive niea ure be no longer possibleif, considering the increasing: Population, the grow.
country, every extonsiomn of tae francise; cano '-- resisted-if, therefore, you are driven by the force of
circumstances to the necessity of what is caUed, and often derisively caUed, " bit-by-bit" reform-if you must consent, as I believe you must, to take reform in fragmentswhat measure, I ask-, will be the safest, and, at the same time, the largest in its scope and operation? Looking at the question in this light, I an decidediyof opinion that this is a portion of the scheme of 1854 which may be most safely introduced, and therefore I wil cordially vote for it. (Hear.) I believe the effect of this measure in the English counties wi 1 be to give the right of voting to many persons who have it not now, but who are entitled to it by personal merit. For instance, to begin with, I thould say that it would give a vote to many of the working clergy (hear), as they are termne,d, who are now excluded-curates, andthose who have not obtained the rectorial position, but who are stil most useful members of the Church of England. (Eear, hear.) Again, Dissenting mninisters 'Would to a great extent be adcmitted. (Eeari; heair.) Hlalf-pay officers also, of bath services, retired tradesmen, and retired clerks either fromtlie public.offices orfrom large mercantile firms,whohave retired to their native vllages or towns on superannuations or on
ensions, will bo admitted to the franchise. (Hear, hear.) he n again the principal country shopkeepers will acquiro

I should - be led too far if I were to pursue this interesting subject, but I have raid enough to Justify myself in giving a vote now, for the lrSt time, in favour. of this motion. I have a great respect for the hon. gentle-. man who sits below me (M!r. Drummond) and also for' the hon. member for West Norfolk, and, thou-gh I may' be exposed to their taunts for the vote which I give. on account of my position in this House, stiUl I feel that my motives are pure, and my conscience does not strike me with the slightest twinge of remorse for the course which I sm pursuing. (Hear, hear.) For the reasons, therefore, wbich I have shortly stated, I cannot refuse to give my vote in favour of this motion. (Cheers.) Let me point out to the hon. member for East Surrey, before 1 sit down, that it wiU be secessaryintheprogress of the BiU through theHouse to insert some guard in it against the abuse of making faggot-votes, of which it may easily now be made the instrument. With reference to this part of the subiect, I would recommend him to look at the BiU introduced by my noble friend the member for London in 1854, in which am le provision is made with regard to joint tenancies, and also to pevent lands joined to hovels or hounee of no worth conferring the franchiso, unless coupled with the occuIpancy of a hou8e of the annual value of 5. With some such bimeudinents, I am satisfied that this will prove a very salutary measure, and I shall therefore give my vote in favour of its introduction.
Wr. BENTINCK, in explanation, denied that he had said that the noble lord the member for London had notbrought in any Reform Bil in 1854, or that he had not brought in any measure while he was in office. What he had said was, that during the years that the noble lord was at the head of the Government, when he had ample opportunity of bring. ing forward a great measure on this subject, and with the cettainty of carrying it, he had never brought in any such measure, and that that fact, coupled with the support which he now gave to this Bill, tended to throw great doubts on the motives of reformers, and was likely to lead the country to suspect that they were acting from party and personal motives.
Mr. L. KING appealed to the nobla lord at the head of the Government, whether, after the speeches of the noble lord the member for London and the right hon. member for Carlisle, he would stiAl persevere in his opposition to the introduction of the BilL As to time and the state of busi ness, if the noble lord would consent to allow the Bill to be brought in, he would undertake to make the best possible use of the time which remained of the session. With regard to the amount at which the franchise should be fixed, that would bo a matter to be discussed in committee. The noble lord was at present the leader of the Liberal party, but if |he divided against this Bil he must recollect ehat he would
eseparatig himself from his own supporters, and would be converting himself into the leader of the opposite side of the House. (Hfear, hear.)
Sr . HERBERT.-Before the House goes toa division, I wish to say a few words in explanation of the vote which I am about to give. I have given the deepest consideration to this subject, and I have satisfied myself of the course which I ought to take. I see two distinct grounds for refusing to vote for the introduction of this biL (Hear, hear.) One, which I derive from the state of parties in this House, and the position of the Government; and the other from the nature of the question itself, and the peculiar form in which such questions ought to be brought before the House. With regard to the latter, It is quite true, as my right hon. friend has stated, that this proposition is identical with that contained in the Bill of 1854, which my noble friend the member for London brought forward as leader of the House of Commons, I being his colleague, and giving my entire adherence to it. It must be recollected, however,that that measure was brought forward not only by the leader of the Government in this House, but that that leader was the noble lord, who, of all men, is bes' cntitled by his authority on this subject to intro. dues such a measure ; and that it was brotght forward with all the weightand authority of theGovernment. lNeither was it an isolated proposition, as this is now; but it was conpled with many other propositions which tended ia great aegree to neutralize it-not to neutralize it in the way of diminishing its efficiency, but to extend its value as a portion of any great measure of reform. I believre it is admitted now, even by the promoters of the original Reform BilL, that the great error of that Bill was the uniformity of its franchise. Hear, hear.) I admit that it is a very di'dicult thing altogetoer to avoid this error, but it ought to be avoided as much as possible. Society is not uniform, and an uniform frauhise will never fairly and completely represent the variety of *classes into which society is divided. (Hear, hear.) But this Bil pro-
es to give an uniform franchise to counties and boroughs. Wid our Bill of 1854 do anything like that? On the contrary, when we proposed to lower the county franchise to 101., we proposed to bring the borough franchise down to 6?. If you do make the franchise uniform, what is the logical deduction? If 101. is to be the only franchise, how can you defend the existence of boroughs at aUl? (Opposition cbeers.) If 50,000 men, because they live closely packed together in a certain area, andunder certain conditions of life are to send two members to Parliament, on what ground are' 500,000 men, because they live scattered widely apart, not to be represented at all? (Reuewed cheerafromthe Opposition.) In the Bill of 1854 various other franchises were introduced -the right of voting was given to university graduates, to all persons with an income of 101. from the funds, to persons with a deposit of 501. in the s tvings-banks to those who paid 40s. assessed taxes or income-tax, or 40s. for licences. I mention these facts to show that a question of thls sort is by no means to be regarded in the same light when it is presented as an isolated proposition as when it forms part of a larpe scheme. (Hlear, hear.) With respect to the state of parties and the position of the Government-to speak plainly of what is visible to all of us-I must say that I think the Government exercise a very wise discretion in the present state of affairs, and looking to the degree of strength wyhich they psess, in not bringing forward questions which it mns be10 Nscultto carry through successfully (Chees.) When I see the Government in a state of great diffculty with regard to that which is infinitely more presing than this question-Imean the financial arrangements of the year -I ain greatly averse from adding another to the number of their embarrassments. (Laughter.) They have decided to oppose this Bill, and I confess their decision has weighed considerably with me. I do not vish to put them into greater difficulties than they are at present (renewed laughter), for I am afraid that by accumulating difficulties upon them we may weaken their hands fo-r the settlement of that grave question at present pending, to a favourable termination of which no gentleman here, I am sure, can yet see his way clearly. Guarding myself, therefore, completely as to the opinons which 1 entertain on the quesion of reform, andvwithout abating one jot of the confidence which I place in the people of this coumtry, or of my belief that their growing intelligence and the independence which their increasing prosperity gives them must entitle them, sooner or later, at the hands of one Government or another, to an extension of the franchise, but objecting to this measure in its present shape, and upon the other grounds which I have mentioned, I shall feel it my duty to vote against the motion of the hon. member for East Surrey. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. ROEBUCK said, he was sorry to trespaS on the attention of the House, but he must express his perfect " wstonishment" at the speech of the right hon. gentleman (Mr. S. Herbert). The right hon. gentleran said he opposed the motion on two grounds. The first was, that it tended to uniformity. The a sght hon. gentleman supported the Bil of the noble lord in 1854, but he o s d, although that Bill contained this precise mneasure, it contained somnething

He wantedto knowwhetherthose three qualificationsinconEtituents would endanger the character of the House? (Hear, hear.) But the right hon. gentleman. had another reason. He objected to weaken the Administration. (Hear, hear.) The House might anticipate that the right hon. gentleman would to-morrow vote with the Government and against the motion of his right hon. colleagne the member for the University of Oxford. (Hear, hear.) If the Government were wrong, then he said to the right. hon. gentleman "'Vote against them." If they were right, "Vote with them." Vere they right on the present proposition? (An hon. Member, "No !") An hon. member answered "No," and he said the argument of the right hon. gentleman did not prove the Government to he right, because he said distctl he bad such faith in the intelligence and probity of his fellow-countrymen that some Government or other, some day or other, mnst bring in a Reform BilL They might suppose that if the right hon. gentleman were a member of that Government he would snpport another Reform Bill, as hesugpported the Reform

(Cheers.)

The announcement of the numbers was received with loud cheering.
MINISTERS' MONEY (IRELAND).
Mr. FAGAI, in rising to move for leave to bring in a Bill to abolish the tax now imposed in lieu of ministers' money, said he was glad to find that Her Majesty's (-overnment did not intend to oppose the introduction of the Bill. He wanted to know, however, what course they intended afterwards to take. The time had arrived for the Government to state what their intentions were in referenee to the final settlement ond abolition} of a'tax that had gven so much dissatisfaction to the people of Ireland, and which was so repugnant to their religious prejudices. He would ask the House to amond tho law, but not with thenview to the more effectual collection of the tax, which had excited so much gry feelng. The amount was paltry, gtd both amon JRoman Catholics and Protestants there was no dference of opinion on a qrestion which had been year after year pressed upon the eonsideration of. Parlimrnent and the tiovernment He knew no reason which could induoo the Government to resdst lis propos6
tion. If the EcelesiastCal Comnisoners had not sufficient funds to makeup the amount of this paltry tax, the Goyeria.
rrent coulad witiot difficulty paceabundant means for that Iurpose at their dasposal. It was due' to the House'and to Ireland that the Governmert should state distinctly their views upon the subject. They would only delde the people of Ireland if they again took the coarse they adoDted last year-if they allowed this Bill to be read a first time and then opposed it on the second reading. (Hear.) The Chief Secretary for Ireland was wel acquanted with the Bill, as it was the same as that of last year, and he therefore ought to state decidedly whether he was prepared tw support it and abolish this irritating and paltry tax? He sj&ould not be satisfied with mere permission to introduce the Bill, and he could not conceive why it should not receive the b-Aport of the Government. The hon. member concludea bD
movng for leave to bring in a Bil to abolish the tar, in lie. of "ministere' money,", now imposed on eight corporate towns of Irelaud.
Mr. HORStA& said that he acceded last year tothe introduction of a similar Bill, not as the hon. member stated, expreassing an opinion that the tax ought to be abolishbed; but declaring that he did so because the present Act was acknowledged to be ineffective and difficult to be carried into operation. (Hear, bear.) At that time he described the difficulties with which the Government found themselves beset in endeavouring to give effect to the measure. The Act threw on the corporations and the Poor lAw guardians of Ireland the obligation, to coUect the tax, though not being members of the established church.
Advances for the income of the clergy were to be rnade in the first instance by the Ecdesiastical Commission; and if the corporations di not repay those advances, then it became the duty of the Government to compel the repayment by proceedings at law. The first difficulty experienced was this-that seven of the corporations on which the obligation of levying the tax was thrown, determined that they would not collect it. They stated that, as they had alwaya objectedto the payment of the tax, they would not be parties to its colection. He had on v former occasion mentioned that the Government were advised that they would find great difficulty in compellin therepaynent; and tha right hon. and learnod gentleman (Mr. Napier) then declared, onhisauthorityas alawyer that ithe Government were in earnest no dificulty would bo foxund. Such being the conflict of opinion, the Government said that they felt it to be their duty as a Government, having ertain powers intrusted to them, to enforce the law as f ar as the comrae of justoo would enable them to do, and accordingly in the fir3t
instance they selected jthe corporation of Cork, the mo,t important o the corporations refusing repayment, against which to try the question. Judgment in the case was given on the 31st of January, and he fully admitted that the
position of the Government and of the Legislature was very dfferent now i respect to the question from whait was previously. A verystrong opinionwas expressed by the judges as to the defectsofthe Act of Parliament, and the corporatonof Cork immediately intimated their intention to appeal. Informations were filed again the other six corporations, who likewise expressed their determination t appeal, and two years or mnore would elapse before a fnal decision could be come to; and then it was obvious that allthe difficulties would not be over. In the meantiume not one shiUin- of
the money was collected, and the Ecclesiastical Commi1ssionersin their last report stated that they had advanced3 21,000. and had only been repaid 4,0001. from the colleotions mado. The question now was what was the Legislature to do? they were in a very different position from that of last year. When on a former occasion he intimated that the Government would waitfor the result of proceedings in a court of law before they expressed an opinion as to the step tobe taken the noblelord the memberfor London stated that theGovernment oughtto adopt one of two courses,-they should either manfully say that they saw tkeir way in respect to amending the Act and bring in such an amendment
as would settle the question, not allowingv the question to be perpetuated as an annual cause of excitement and agitation; or, if they could not do that, then the other manly courSe was to adopt the motion of the hon. miember for Cori. (Hear, hear.) In answer to that appeal he stated that that was the way in which the Government intended to act. As soon as the result of the proceedings in the court of law was known the Government, in conformity with
thepledgeg ven lastyear, took the wbole questionintoconside-
ration, wit the viewof seeing whether theycould prep are a measure satisfactory to Parliament andsettlingthequestion. As judgment had only recently been given,sufficient time had not elapsed to enable the Govermnent to mature any plan as yet; but, while assenting now to the introduction of the Bill of the hon. member, be expressed a hope that he should be in a condition, on the second reading or before, to state to the House the views and intentions of the Govermnent on a matter which all parties concurred in thinking ought
to be placed on a more satisfetory basis than it stood on at Present.
Mr. BAGWELL4 as the Protestant representative of a- constituency composed of Protestants, Catholics, and Dissenters of every description, caUed upon the Government to bring in a Bil for the total andimmediate abolition of this tax. (Hear, hear.) The Protestant part of his constituency regarded the existing law as an infringement of the libertyof the subject, while the Catholie portion looked
upon it as arem nant of thatoldpenal code which every honest Jrishman desired to see abolished. H e did not think that all tbe ingenuity of the lawyers on the Miaisterial benches would be able to frame a measure which would satisfy the peale of Ireland, unless it were for the unqualified abolition of ministers' money. Were the few thousand
pounds collected in that shape worth the bitter agitatibn which accompanied the levying of them ?
Mr. NAPIER would refrain from dweling at any length upon the question, as the Secretary for Ireland had reserved tiU the second reading of the Bill the view which the Government took of it; but he was certainly startled when he heard that right hon. gentleman say that not a shiing
of the tax had been levied recently, for he (Mr. Napier) had himself paid a good many shillings of it,
Mr. HOR RSAN.-I said that seven corporations had determined not to levy the tax, and that in the seven towns over which they had jurisdiction not a shiing had been lavied.
Mr. NAPIER believed that the great bulk of the tax was levied in Dublin, and was not aware that any difficulty had
been ex erienced there. The hon, member opposite (Mr.
Bagweh had spoken of the tax as a rem nant of the penal ode, whereas it was established by an Act passed in 1854.
(Laughter.) But there was an earlier Act, passed in the
rei of Charles IL, which first established ministers' money
wit the view of inducing English artificers to settle in towns in Ireland, inasmuch as it put a charge upon the houses in those towns for the support of clergymen of the
same religion as these artificers. A nd the Roman Catholic
owners or tenan ts of the houses upon which that char,,-vwas
imposed had now no more right to complain of it than would th.e Roman Catholic purchaser of an estate sold by the Encumbered Estates Court subject to a charge imposed
uon it by a previous Protestant owner for the endowment of a Protestant church. If the tax were abolishod, what would become of those clergyrmen who depended upon it for their support ? Its abolition would merely benefit the Pro-
testant owners or ocoupiers of the houses upon which it was levied. It was said that ir John Young framed the A t of
1854 with the intention of enabling the corporations of those towns in which the tax was levied to raise difficulties which would prevent its collection; but he (Mr. Napier) could not impute to him any such intention. When the Government found that diffiulties had arisen, they ought to have consulted the law officers of the Crown, aud brought in a Bill which would have made the matter so clear as to leave no room for cavil or dispute.
If the c orpations objected to collect this money, let its collection e taken out of their hands, and let it be collected -ither by the Ecclesiastical Conuiasioners or by the ministers themselves. If the clergymen themselves collected it, all Protestants would pay at once, and Roman Catholics might state their objections,
Mr. BOWYER understood the right hon. gentleman to suggest that all Roman Catholiicshoud sbbe exempted from
the payment of this tax, and expressed the willingness of
himselfandotherIsh members to accept this proposal, and thtotehustotenate a debates and disputes upon the sub-
Mr. WHITESIDE said that the hon. and learned gettleman had entirely misunaerstood the argument of his right hon, friend the member for the University of Dublin (Mr. Napier), who had contende d that this tax was a charge upon property, and, therefore, these affected scruples of conscience had nothing to do with the question. He (Mrr.Whiteside) could never discover the injustice of this tax, the objections urged iaainst which would equally apply to a rentcharge. In the case which had been referred to the corporation of Cork realy had a cause for complaint against the Government, because the two commi ssioners w hon ht
to have gone to Cork and ascertained aU the habit abole househ of which the rent was more than 101. a-year, such only being liable to this ta:, never lef t DLblin Ca%tle, where they would wish for ever to reside, but simply opened the ratebook, and assessed all premises, no matter what, the rent of which was inore than101. The result of this was thaa among othor premises they had assessed a racket court, a place for which it was never inteded tthat ministers' money should be paid.
Mr. 1fEAGHBR said that the decision of the matter now in dispute would not settle this question, because if it were
d cidedlthat the corporaonstmust ma y t heir arrears to the GoGvernment it would then have to tobe ided w hether the
c orporations could enforce payment fro m ther ayer y3 Many houses in the towns sabject to this objetionabl
impost were taken, and the rents of them agreedun, before ministers' money was leviedfro h The tax, therefore, was a tax, not upon the prope rty, but upon the occupiers. Nothing but its entire ab olit on satisfy the people of Ireland.
Mr. MAGUIR B observed that the question to be dealt with was one of Principle, not of detail. The corporations
and the constituencies liable to this obnoxious a un unjust tax were resolved to use every legal means for resisting its imposition. It was an error to call this a tax on house
property-the houre was made the excuse, and its ocgippaat the victim. (" Hear," and a laugh.) The Roman Catholic ratepayers of Ireland, who were the overwhelming majority, had no wish to rob the excellent Protestant clergymen who received the produce of this tax; they wished rather to see
them -paid, and paid well, but t not out of the pocket s of pe'ople who conscientiously dissented from their religion.
lRenewed laughter.) He implored the Chief Secretary for
Ireland. then, if he desired to promote peace and conenrd
amogal l classes in that country- if he felt the serious
weight of responsibility attached to his high office-not to peddle and tinker with this important queistion, but at once to make a clean sweep of an impost that had too long dsrcd thaed Sttthe-bookcwo
Leave was then given to bring int the Bill.

iad repeatedly travelled on previons oecsions; bA he asouldeconfnc himself to a very few remarks, recommend. iDg his motion to their serious attention. He had no ambi. tious views to farther-no personal animosity to gratiy. Hohadtheprivilegeof knowingmanyhonourable and upright lIomsan Catholieq, who wero good citizens aud goodaubjoets, andwbo, he was eure,conscientiously believed thattheirviews werofoundedon truth, The hon. gentleman then referrad to the fate of his Bill of last session on the same subject, and eomplained that, after the House had deliberately assented to its introduction, and had al30 virtuallyagreed to its being read a seoond time, an hon. member took an undue advAntage of the Parliamentary forms by speaking up to a quarierto 6 o'clock on a Wednesday, and thus in effect stultified the previous decision of the House. He trusted that on the present occasion he would not be exposod to so dis.
courteous and unfair a proceeding: but that the discussion i on the question which he was about to raise wouldI be allowed to reach its final and legitimate issue.! He had been told that this motion had grown to be a compilete nuisance. ("Rear, hear," and laughter.) But whoss
ault wasi'? was it the fault of him who broughtforwardI the motion, or of those who used every means of evasion and delay to prevent the House coming to a decision upon it? (Hear, hear.) Last year, certainly, his opponents had allowed him to come to a division, b A it was at a moment when the Ministers and the leaders of his own party were out of the House, and when they thought, therefore, that he would surely be oeaten. They found themselves mistaken, however, and immediatelythe old tactics were resorted to. He was very much afraid that the same line of factious opposition would be resorted to this year. (Erar, hear.) A a Protestant, he objected to be taxed to pay for the maintenance and propagation of a religion the doctrines of which he believed to be contrary to the word of God. This grant he believedtobe a national sin, and it was a sin which, if it were not removed, would sooner or later bring down upon this country that heavy judgment by which so marry mations had already been overwhelmed. To support such a college was completely contrary to the Protestant consti. tution of the country, and in &ect violation of the coronation oath taken by the Sovereign. One great article of tho established church which the Sovereign swore to maintain was that the doctrines of the Roman Catholic church were ' blasphemous fables;" and yet, they were called upon to py for the supportof acollege which taught those doctrines. Those hon. gentlemen who had carefully studied the report of eommnonerswonld agreowithhimthat theconolusions at which they had arrived were entirely unsupported by the evidence lai before them. For instance, they stated that they had no reason to believe that asything like dislovalty was taught at the college, or that there was any disposition existing there many way to impair the obligations of allegiance to the Crown; but this was in direct opposition to the evidencewhich was laid before them. Frenent instanees of this sort might be found by dissectinLg th report and the evidence, and, though he should not read any now he should be perfectly prepared to lay extracts before the House at a ature stagc which would fuUy confirm his assertion. The first witnesses examined were gentlemen connected with the college who were interested in Its continumne. There was a Mr. O'Hanlon, librarian, who said at first that the authority of the church was purly spiritual, and that it was not right in priests to interfere with elections, but who afterwards was got to aUow that there might be cases in which a wrong vote would be a sin against morality, and wrherever sach was the case it was the priest's duty to punish the voter. It was clear from the evidence that in the eyes of these men the church was the paramount object, and that whatever militated against their church's interest must be trod under foot. Oa the other side wero examined persons who had had personal experience of the evils of a Maynooth education, and they directly contradicted al that had been said by the priests and professors. One gentleman told the commissioners he had imbibed such notions and such opinions at the college that he was nothing better than a rebel when he left it. (Cheers, and a laugh.) The evidence must convince every one that the commiSsioners had been baffled and misled by the Jesuits * and he had ventured over and over again to tell the noble ford who had presided over that commission, and than whom a more honourable man in every relation of life did not exist, that he had not calibre enough to cope with the Jesuit. ("Hear," and alaugh.) The case was far differentwiththo commission which sat in 1827, and which ras presided over most carefuUy and assiduously by the late Sir T. F. Lewis; for, although the commnssioners at that period were unable to agree to any report, they left the evidence which they had taken to speak for itself, and any one who comparod the proceedigs of the two bodies would see in howsuperior a manner the former had conducted their investigation. Now, he asked the House to reflect for a moment upon the progress of this grant. It was originally a permissive grant enaring certain Roman Catholics to form a college for the education of their priests. It was humbly sought for, most graternUy received, and it was given with the full and confident hope that by educating the priests at homo there would be a better class greated than by educating them abroad; and. had theprofessions which wero made by the Roman Catholics at that period been acted upon, they would not naow be regarded with so much euspinion by the Protestants. Having obtained that permission, they next came,-still humble, still sBuplian, -to ask fornmoney; andsotheywentoninch by inch, everyconcession which was made to them creating only a fresh demand, until they came now, not as suppliants for money, promising that they would realy submit to the Government of the country, and conduct themselves as quiet citizens, but claiming it as a right. (Cheers from below the gangway. That should warn the people of this country to give them no mote, and, while conceding to them every civil right, no longer to encourage them with Protestant money in thc pro pagation of their Popish errors. Some feeble-minded friends of his who disapproved the grant as much as he did had said to him,-" If you meddle with this you'll destroy
e rotestant Church in Ireland." But ho was not to he frightened from his position, even by such a statement as that. There was no analogy whatever between the two cases, and the First Lord of the Treasury had himself said so in the debate two years ago. He therefore left that ouestion with the most perfect 'confidence in the hands of the noble lord, satisfied that, so long as he was Prime Minister, not one sixpence would ever be abstracted from that which belonged to the established Church. His merry friends below the gangway said that it was theirproperty first. (Hear, hear.) Then they knew nothing of history. (A laugh.) If they did, they would know that long before the plague and leprosy of popery found its way into Ireland there was a Christian church existing and endowed there, holding the same doctrine, administering the sacraments in the same way, and preaching the same Scriptures as the united establisleed Church did at this day. (" Hear," and
IOh, oh.") He might be told that the property had been left to that church for certain uses which were contrn to law. He a'mitted that; but then it was their duty to deal with such property as the Court of Chancery did in similar cases every day, and to order it to be appropriated in the bestlegal waythat it could be, in conformity with the wishes of the testators. He contended, therefore, that the title of the united Church of England and Ireland to that property was as good and sound as was ever possessed by any church to any property whatever. Moreover, many ancient families in this country held their estateshbrgreeiszey similar titles, and the feeling of self preservation, t erefore, would make them pause before they lent their aid to the intended spoliation o the established Church of England and Ireland. He wished to call their attention to another and a most important point-the struggle which for years had been and was stiU going on at Maynooth between the Gallican and Ultramontane doctrines. What iras the object for which Maynooth was founded? Parliament was afraid of the prevalence of Ultramontane doctrines, and desired to give such an education to the Roman Catholic priests in Ireland as would induce them to become contentd and loyal subjects of the Crown. Well, years passed on and a variety of changes were gradefally introduced at ttaynooth. In the first place, the original trustees were changed; they were converted into visitors, who, according to the statement of one of them, went over the college once in two or three years, but had little or no power to interfere. The next change was an ilteration of the books. In one of the reports on the college there was a catalogue of the works which the professors used in their classes; bat what were the commissioners told and expected to believe? Why, that the books
were there, but were not used as textbooks; that the students - might read them if they pleased, but they formed no part f the education given in the college ; that, in fact, there was no regular system of education, tho professors choosing their own subjects and clucidating them in whatever way they thought best. He maintained, nevertheless, that a great change had taken place in the books. Bailly had bean prohibited. Why? Because he held the doctrines of the Gallican Church, which it was not convenient for the Pope to entertaln. Therefore, Baidy had been placed in the Jnder. What had been substituted? A book as full of Ultramontane doctrine as it was possible for any book to be The author was Seavini. and Pope Pius IX. permitted his letter recommending the book to be put in the preface because Scavini snpported the doctrines of Liguxori. In his chapter Dc Legi&us Scavini asserted that the Pope liad power to make laws for the whole Christian world. That was contrary to the old GaUician dootrine, upon which Maynooth was founded; but it was the Ultramontane doctrine of the present day. "'The Pope," continued Scavini, "was the sutccessor Of the divine Peter, the true Vicar of Christ. the head of the whole Church, the father and teacher of all Christians, and to him was given the plenary power
of ruling and govctning thc wholc Church " Not, be vUh ,Orov Uernaiy gvrnD; hre'S

nosuch word in the book., Speakfing of human
laws, Scavini said that the precept of Scripture whichenjoinedobedience to hudman laws couldnotbe vio lated without high criminality, ",unless"-and here the Jesuit betrayed hhnself-."zanthing is enjoined which is aqgainst the laws of God and of the Church."1 Sovereigns, therefore, were to be obeyed by their subjects only when their laws were in harmony with those of the Church. Such wasnthe doctrinetaughtatMaynooth. Was theouse prepared to continue its sanction and its pay to ,an establih. meatwhere uVohprincipleswereinstUledintotheminus fthe Roman Catholio priesthood? Scavini also discussed the question of the promulgation of the pontifica laws in the provinces beyond the Roman States. Hmi contended that 0dthe ought to be so promulgated, said that it would degrade the Pope to call bin s a oreign prince, and claimed fr Romib the right of being regrded as the centre of Christendom. It was niot astonishing that the priests educated at Maymooth should be turbulent and disoyal. The question was put by Scavin,-
"Is a -witnes bound to restituTWon who conceals the truth fromn a judge lawfully interrogating?' The answer was,-
"S omae say he is so bound, but others--Lugo, 3Molina, Lesstids-deny that he is, and say 'that by silence he does not sin against justice."'P

Mr. KENDt aL. in seconding the motion, expressed he s hope that in what he maght say he would not wound the feolings Of RDman Casthen1, with whom. he had mixed muhb, and from many of whom, both in this counatry and abroad, he h ta experienced great kindness. He did not support the motion on the grounds on which it was advocated by the hon. memoer or North Warwickshire. He based his objection to the taynooth gPrt simply on the
ound of the course which was universaly pursued by man Catholics towaras Protestants in matters relating to religion, and he held that itl sef-defence Protestants ought to be cautious not to entriust power in the hands of Romans Catholios. He must sad however, that he believed RomaP Cathoies, knowing their strength, were actuated by the most conscientious notives, and he thought Protestants might with great advantage imitate the unity of their action. The fact was that the Roman Catholics respected the hon. member for North Warwiokshinre o account of his earneFtness and zeal (hear, hear), while they despised those hon. gentlemien who had noticourage and nerve enousgme to follow his example. He would ask the Houa e to consider the course which had been pursuedi by the Catholic meombers with regard to all measures affect. ing the Protestant reuion. Every Bit favoutrable to the Protestant religion which had been introduced into Parliament diring the last 20 years had encountered the most determined opposition from the Roman Catholics. Maoay hon. gentlemen were in the habit of travelling on the continent, where in Roman Catholic countries they experienced the utmost kindnoes and hospitality, but they must have observed that whenever the question of religion was involved everybting was done to humiliate them. ff Roian Cotholics had the support of the power of a State, they thought it their duty to oppress those who differed froit
thom in the matter of religion. It 1831 and 1835 he was residing for some time in the dominions of the Grand Duke of Tuscanm,mwho was then regarded as a kind, generous, and noble-minded ruler, hut within the last 20 years he had b4een induced to resort to acts of the grossest oppressionx towards opponents of the Roman CAtholic faith. He (mor. Kendall) would only ask the Roman Catholic members of that flouse not to expect Protestant members to grant them anypowers whaich might be used adversely to the Protestant religion. (hlear, hear.) The hon. member for£ lorth Warwickahice was blamed for raising this ques. tion last year, because, during the war witheRussia, Roman Cathoul soldiers had been ghting side by side with Protestants, and any meare which could excite a difference between them was strongly deprecated;h btthie (Mr. Ken. dali) believedthat the present was as opportune an occasion as was likely to occur for considering the grant to aaynooth. He suspected that both pthin and without that House, there wore many persons who, although not professing thae Roman CAtholic hrelgon, were still by their acts-some designedly, and others unconswouslydoing av l they could for its promotion. These persons wvere not numerous, but their
ntege their means, ancd their position rendere them poerful;and dangerous. He considered that they were untrue to the religion they professed, and thatithose of them who were membe of that House were untrue to the constituencies they were a (pposed to represent.

Mr. ROBEUCK hoped the House woald give him credit for not wishing to enter into any theological discussion. He was suredthey would appreciate the manner in which the hon. wember who last spoke had expressed hIs opinions upon this subject. He (Mr. itoebuck) wishe he could sa6y as much of the hon. gentlemandwho had brought forward the motion. (A laugh.) It appeared to himathat that hen. gentleman (por Spooner) had read history very ocuriouslyhe had read it through the light of prejudice, The hon. gentleman began by sayingh tha the College of Msaynootlh was endowed because this country desired to exclude the power of the Pope. He, would endeavour to show the House that the granti as founded oan justice, on polic, and on the higr Pin pe

am tho present. He must contradict the statement of the hen, member. This was not a Protestant assembly. It was an assembly representing the opinions of the people of three countries. It was neitfier Protestant, Catholic, nor Episoo-
plian. Scotland had one religion, England another, and Irea'nd a third. There was also a vast multitude of Dissenting bodies represented. They might cal them Prrotestailt If they Would, but they were no more Protestants than Catholics were Catholic, and the representatives of the Catholic population were as mauch representatives of the Deole s Potetans.Therefore, he said this was not a xotetau womly.(Hear, hear.) Buti the Parliament of Ireland was a Protestant Parliament. It was eleected by Protestants, and Protecstants only could sit in it. They establishedl the College of Maynooth. They endowed the College of Maynooth, andl the House shLould remember why they did sD. They dreaded not Ultramontane doctrines, but Gallic dotrinies. The thing they feared was revoluLtionary France, and revolutionary France was the place where Irish priests were educated. Rovolutionary principles originuating in France had sprea
over the whole continent, andL in order to prevent IrishL prielsts imbibing revolationar doctrines on the continent and importing them into Ire?'andi the Coilego of M,aynooth was created. Then came the union of Ireland with England, and the English Parliament thought themselves bound in justice to accept that which the Protestant Parlilsienot of Ire7land had sanctioned. All the great men of the timne So thouLght, and at the head of them was Mr. Pitt. (He3r, hear.) For centuries Protestant England tried to root outt Catholicism in Ireland. They passed laws that were a disgrace toay c-ivilized community. ThLey tried every possible men that cruelty and bigotry could induoe, to root ouLt Catholic doctrine. They failedl,andain1829wereocompelled to grant_Catholic Emancipation. Maynooth was ceate
for ;nglishi purposes and had been maintained by the Parliament of England. (Cheers.) So far as to the
justice of the case. Now as to policy. The grt oody of the people of Ireland were Catholics. It was for the interests of the United Kingdom that thero should ba peaco and goodwill among the various parts of the empire. A very few short years had passed since they had endesvoured to be just towards Ireland, and he would point tD that country and contrast her condition with what it was under Protestant domination. They were a prosperou a peaceable, and, he was almost ashamed to use the word, a loyal people. When he said ashamed to use the word, he meant that at this time of day any man should be called upon to vindicate to his fellow men the conduct of the IriBh
roople. Theers.) Thoy had been to us brothers when we ought. T¶ey had ben ewith us shoulder to shoulder in every great battle recorded in the page of history. . They had beea

(Cheers) Motions of this sort, ye-arlyrepeated inlanguLage such as they had heard to-night, were very impolitic, and, if bon. genLtlemen would pardon him for sayin g so, very unChristian, (Cheers.)

Mrt. ROEBUC.K.-I said that I Would judge no mnan In hsis religion.
Mfr. T. CHA.MBERS was not aware that he had misrep resented the hon. and learned mnember. Bnt how did the hfon. and learned member's argament apply? The question was not whether they should judge and condemn another man's religeon, but whether. they saould pay for it. (Hear, hear.) The question was whether, when he was called on to conicur an a vote giving so mnany thousand poundsa a year for the support of Maynooth, he was condeinning another man's religion, if he acted up to his convictions and declined to dlo so. (Hear, hear.) It was pseudo-charity, false liberality, and inidifferentism, which re.a. ll Ii alike, and it was anisult to r iei thotheyfdifaered the same smooth, ox TO"te if, a n indelnte
and uncertain notions. That was not charity, and would sustain no inference. It only served to put for a single moment the opponent of the man who used such an srgu ment into an apparently false position. and to make him appear as aL person who, while in reality vindicating truth, and therefoxe cbarity, was acting on the weakness of his understanding and the bigotry of his heart-phrases calculated to illustrate the taste of the hon. and learned member for Sheffield. (Hear, hear.) This question had been debated and de ide the country and must be decided in that House. It was Idle to say that it was a theological, subject. It was not a theolo-
gcal subject, but a question of p lain morals, which the liDglish people understood, and would never cease to under. stand- so long as they had the Bible in their possession and until Popery should have behn endowed in this country. (Hear, hear.) He was happ to think that no Roman Catholic member -would do some of the things mentioned in the books referred to ; but where was the force of the argumerit that it was idle to look to those books, when, indeed, the House was called onx to judge respecting the college and the system of education pursued there? (RTear, hear.) This House was the proper arena in which to judge of that system, and the books taught in the college constituted the best teat of the education carried on there. U pon these principles he had. arrived at the conclusion that the time had comne when, whatever might be done with the 26,GO0I. -which he was not desirous of taking from theo Roman Catholics, and would give to any one or more of their secular charities-the Maynooth endowment should cease. (Hear, hear.)
Mrii. Serieant O'BRIEN desired that the grounds on s-wlich theo Roinan Catholic mFembers opposed the present motion should not be misunderstood. It was not as amatter of pecuniary consideration that they supported the May. nooth endowment ; for they did not come aLs suppliants to seek the bounty of the State, nor were they apprehensive that the withdrawal of the grant would affect the Roman Catholicoreligion. They, however, would view the success of the motion as a violation of the rigthts guaranteedI to the Roman Catholics by a solemn act of theI Legislature. (Hear, hear.) The grant had been for years a1 recgnzd, but inadequate consideration for the properby of wich tzhee Catholic church and people had beenx deprived ; and its withdrawal would constitute an act of injusticethe moregalling on account of the offensive and unfounded charges which bad been so recklessly made against the Catholic religion and faith. (Hear, hear.) Independent of all considerations peculiar to the Ronsan Catholic body, they, onL public and national grounds, and as subjects interested in the prosperity of the
.nsamu errecated the calamitous consequences which woul reultomRiving a sanction to charges such as had been made that night, proclaiming tlsat the Roman Catholic People should be regarded with suspicion and distrust, thereby placing tbem in antagonism with the rest of the Queen's subjects, and declaring that the tenets of their faith 'were inconsistent with liberality and freedom. (Hear, hear.) The general interests of the State were much more affected by the question than the peculiar interests of the Roman Catholics. He had noapprehiension that the witbdrawal of the grant wouldimnpede the education of the RomanuCatholic Priesthood, for the Catholic people were so much attached to their faith that they would provide for that object by anakieg every pecuniary sacrifice in their p ower ; and, sup-
poigthat their own reowurces proved Insufficient, the maistance of the Catholic church in other countries. would not be withheld. Es-tablishments for the pur. poes woulId be formed in foreign States, and every one of themi would be a proof of the injustice and imapolicy of
Biihlgisain (Hear, hxear.) When, therefore, they talk-ed of the danger of the tenets of the Catholic church, they should bear in mind tbajo they would increase that
dangr b ''mgto the priesthood a foreig education and orein a ts,and causing them to feel gratitude to foreign countries for the assistance they were deprived of at home. (Hear, hear.) Could, it then, be matter of surprise tb at the principle of this grant should have been adopted in 795 ad tatevery successive Government, however ~~rjuice aaint heRoman Catholic faith, should have fel te ncesit o seurnga domestic education for the Cathoic piest ood? sould not enter into what was saIedthetholoicl prtof the subject, andl should not disusswih te hn.memerfor North Warwickshire si-ledextact ofevidence,'t but he asked, since Roman ~latolis hd ben dmitedto aparticipation of rights with Protstans, nd RmanCatholic soldiers intrusted with the deec of national honour, had their conduct roed them unwoxthy of the conisdencereposea inthe?(ar hear.) The goundlessmess of the comnplaints ofthho.m be for North Warwickshire as to the pretneddsoylyand immorality of the doctrines taught to h oa ahlc of Ireland by their priests was best provdb h oat and good conduct of both clergy andpol.Tehn member for Hertfomd had said thatth dseow ntf Maynot would produce religious peace. If he (Mr. Serjen 'rie) thought that such would be the case, and tht hee olmical discustsions, which were so derogatozj,to the characte of the House (hear, hear)-these exhibitionsof religious intolerance, in which, when the cause of religion was advocated, all religion was laid aside-he owned that, unjust and oppressive as was this measure, he should be somewhat consoled. But it was utterly delusive to hold out any such hope. The hon. member for North Warwickshire and his supporters would not be satisfi ed with the withdrawal of the Maynooth grant. They would make onslaughts upon the State payments to the Roman Catholic chaplains in the army and navy, and upon the State Provision made for the religous wants of the Roman Catholic inmates Of our gaols, asylums, and other public institutions. Those payments -wouldl be denounced as nationsl sins and as pregnant with danger to the State. There would be a revival of these polemical discussions upon each occasion of the yearly est;ma6tes beBing submitted to the House. Thelhon.imember for Her tford had alluded to our colonies, but he (Mr. Serjeant O'Brien) apprehended that neither the seal of that hon. gentleman nor of the hoa, member for Warwickahire would inkduce them to extend the principle of this mevasre to our colonies. There were reasons which would render that course inconvenient (hear), and which would incline them to extenuate the guilt of this naitional sin.

(Hear, hear.) All that Ireland asked was that the same policy shoald be ado pted towards her as had been adopted towards our colonia possessions. He called upo the Hours not to legislate exceptionally towards Ireland by withdrawing this grant, which, although small in amnount, was important in principle. Let them not reverse that policy which had been sanctioned for 1.6 years by their wisest statesmen and by eveiy successive Administrattion. Let them oppose this mneasure, which was unxworthy of an enlightened State, and 'which, although exasperating in its results, wouldl be pow. erless but for evil-which, while it would fall to produce the results anticipated by its supporters, would create in the minds of the Irish people a deep, hitter sense of wrong and a distrust in the justice of British legislntion. (Cheers.)
Mir C. H. I MOORE fully appreciated and even felt sympathy for the senutimsent which prevailed among the English people that it was unjust to call upon them to support a religion of whioh they disapproved, and on that' ground he had some inclination to vote for the motion, but more especially on the ground that if it were carried to its ultimate conclusion it must, as an inevitable corollary, lead to a similar dealing with other ecclesiastical establishments. (Caeers.) A cricical analysis, both of the agitation out of doors on this question r-sd of the division that might take place in that House upon it, would tend to fortify the opinion expressed by the hon. member for North Warwickshire that it was wrong to call upon one man to anupport the religion of aniother when he b3lieved that religion to be contrary to the Word of God. Ttue hon. gentbleman, however, thought -it was right for the State to contribute to the support of the nuino-ity of the people of Ireland, consisting of Episcopalians, Pres'uyterians, and Unitarians, because all of these religios were, in his opinion, in harmony with the Word of Geold; but that it was sinful to contribute anything inx support of the religion of the vast mnajority, because he, forsoolth. ponouniced that religionx to be conitrary to the Word of God. He (Mr. Moore) would riot argue theology with the bon. gentlenian (who, in respect of Protestantism, was exceedingly latitudinarian), because he did not believe that his pionagreed with those of the people -of ~ -.nngsao; an,as_fa as Irln wscueie,h
mnggna an, staras relndwas concerned, he could afford to regard the hon. gentleman's opinions as he world those terrible tusks of the megatherium and mastodon and other extinct animals, which were no longer permitted to trample down their opponents. (LIa-ghter.) The hoo gentleman himself betrayed a consciousness that his own. opinions would not pass imuster out of doors. He (Mr. Spooner) had stated that Protestantism was the establi-hed religion of this country, and that the Sovereign was bound hy oath to maintain the Protestant religion. Bat he (Mr. Moore) interrupted that statement with something like an interpellation, upon which the hon. gentleman remarked that he (Mr. Moore) had not read history. Now, Mr. Burke denied that Protestantism ever had been established as the religion of the State. The hon. member for North Warwickshire had told the House that before the English invasion the Irish people belonged to a religion which was similar, or nearly so, to the Protestantism of the present day, and that tithes were established for t'ho anpport of that religion. It was supposed by somne (with
whom he (M1r. hloore) did not concur) thatthe religion professed by the people of Ireland previously to the English invasion was not precisely similar to that of the Church of Rome; but there never was any doubt as to its not being I represented in the smallest degree by the Protestantism of the present day. And even if it were it certainly was not supported by tithes, for it was not until after the English invasion that tithes were established in Ireland.
Mr. SPOONlER.-I never mentioned the word "tithes." MLr. G. H. MOORE.-Bat the hon. gentleman spoke of

In pont of fact, strpping thbis question of all the false issues with which it had been overlaid by the hon. mnember for North Warwickshire and the hon. and learned member for Hertford, the real difficulty that pressed on the common sense and the conscienaoes of the people of Ireland was that they had to -
for the diffusion of a religion which they believedto
be contrary to the Word of God, and of whilch they there. fore disapproved. (Hear, hear.) He thought the result of this agitation would be to read a lesson to the people of England, and to serve as an amusing afterpieco to the more serious drama in which the noble lord the member for the city of London played the principal part a few years ago. It was only five years since that noble lord was at the head of the Government of the country and the foremost man of a reat party. He had won his great name, his position, and-a office by deeds in the cause of cIvil afid religious liberty, and when in that position it suddenly occred to him that he would appeal to the dominant and arrogant intolerance of England in favour of civil and religous liberty. (Hear, bear.) What was the result? He was eminently successful; his letter to the Bishop of Durham was caUed an admirable production, and his Ecclesiastical Titles Aut an effective measue. Ho had with him almost the unanimous opinion of that House, but he had not with hin the star of his house or the traditions of his party. (Tear,hear.) What, he repeated, had been the result? The hill that was carried with such triumph by that House, and received with zo much satisfaction by the country, utterly broke down (hear, hear), and with it the Government of the noble lord himsel f, in spite of the feeling of the House and the country; and as the result of the subseauent appeal to the people the only party found capabte of goveraing the countrythroughthat Housewasthatwhieh had the courage to resist the arrogant demands of a dominant intolerance. (Hear, hear.) He thought the example of the noble lord ought to be an everlasting warninb to the statesmen of England how they held a parley with that faitbless phantom of British intolerance which was halt hypocrisyand half aswindle. ("Hear, hear," and a laugh.) For his own part, he (Mr. Moore) was indifferent as to the result of the motion before the House. The granst to 0&ayuooth was not a boon whIch the people of Irelind cared so much to retain. The eIislature of this country established that grant for ita; own and for British purposes, and let them nowa do awvay wvith it on behalf of the two gentlemen wvhose names he regretted, for the sake of antitihesis, that he was not at liberty to mention in the House of Commons. (Laughter.)
Mr. DRUMMOND.-The question, Sir, now under the consideration of the House divides itself into two very distinct aspects. The first is the political aspect. This was a lb rgain between the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Irelaud, and you cannot honestly break it. You may alter it, and may plead in so doing the change of time and circumstances; but if you do that the result will be to make the change more advantageous to the other party than to yourselves. I said last year I should certainly prefer this grant being given to the Roman Catholics that they mightsend theirminmsterstobe educated abroad, because I believe that would give us a better clss of men as priests, and that they would get a batter education at Rome thau they did in England. That, however, is a questioh for them to settle, and not for me. But, Sir, there is another point which it becomes the House to take into consideration. The hon. gentleman (Mr. Spooner) can scarcely conceive that this is a little isolated filching of another man's property. Is he not aware that he is asking the House to begin a new course of policy towards the Irish people, such as we have not pursued for the last 0 years? Is it possible he can conceive that if he carried this question of the repeal of the grant to Maynooth the thing would be at an end? If he does not think that, surelyheoughttohaveinformed us what are the other re3ults that must inevitably follow and how he means to meet them. But it seems to me as if the hon. gentleman was merely a sort of Philadelphian, refusing to pay hIs debts. (Cheers and laughter.j Because he does not like his bargan he wants to be off. Why, such conduct as that is only worthy a ticket-of-leave mau. (Renewed laughter.) He may remember, for he is fond of quoting texts of Scenpture, that there is one which refers to the man that "esweareth to his neighbour and disappointeth him not, though it be to his own hurt." The hn,n gentleman seems to think that it is his duty to destroy popery in every possible way. Now, popery is likeothe shield of old of which we have heard, which had one colour on one side and another on the reverse. Iquite agree with him as to the report which resulted from the recent examination into the College of Maynooth, for certainly the worthy nobleman at the head of thatcommission proved himselfutterlyincapableand ignorant if everything he was commissioned to inquire into, and no iooner had he failed in that, the only publio mission on which he was ever employed, than they immediately made bim a Cabinet Minister. (Laughter and cheers.) That was an example of finding out the right man for the right place. A lasgh.) Now, the hon. gentleman says that the doctines of the Romish priests are such as to render it unsafe to tolerate their teaching in this country. [grant everything he says on that subject, and Iam not going to recant one word which I have ever said in reference to it. Bat it is rather cool for Irish members to talk of the persecution of Roman Catholics in Ireland. In Soain they put to death any man who may presume t differ Erom them; and what have we lately read in the papers in reference to what has been done in France ! Do not suppose I am abandoning any of thE opinions I have always held on these points. No such thing. I would not have the people of England imagine. either, that there is the smallest change in any of the most abominable claims pat forward by the Romish Church. I must say, though, that I was surprised to hear the hon. gentleman opposite (Mr 3pooner)talk about the difference between ultra-montane nd ccismontane opinions. There never, was such a ihing. " Oh ! ") There never was such a difference. (A .augh.)C,entlemen may smile, but I again repeat that there never was sich a thing. It is perfectly true that two orthree French bishops did set up for a certaiu time a claim to what tihey called anindependent Gallican church,butRome never tblerated it for a single moment. Then, again, the hon. *entleman talked of Jesuits; but a Jesuit is only a cleverer man than another Papist; there is not a single doctrine brought forward by them which is not also a doctrine of the Roman Church. (Hear.) All the harm I wish the hon. entleian opposite is to read and study his own books. (A. fsugh.) As for the Roman Catholics, I never met with a Roman Catholic gentleman who, when shown theso works, was not horrified with the doctrines of his own church. rho hon. gentleman talks about superstition. Is it possible that he knows so little of what is going on tmroughDUt the world as to believe that the tendency of men's minds at the present moment is towards superstition? The thing which is carrying away the church, and Protestantism, and everything else is your German theolog.. ("Hear, hear," and a laugh.) Do you attempt to raise;a cry against those foolish Pliseyites? Why, it is you yourselves who are emasculating the Church of England. You have deprived it of everything which is the essential characteristic of a church, and those essential characteristics are now foundin this country in the Cburch of Rome alone. (Laughter.) Yes I I say, you have denied and are denying more strongly every day the essential characteristic of a church, which is the presence of God in its priesthood and in its sacraments. ("Oh!") I know no churcharecognized by you but the Romish Church which does stand as a witness, a faithful witness, before God as to these braths ; and I would do anything ratherthan let that church go down. ("Oh," and a laugh.)
Mr. Serjeant SHEE believed that this was the second time in the history of the world when a pro phet, intending to curse the people of God, had been obliged to bless them (laughter)-oblhged by an inspiration (" Oh") from some source or other to pronounce the raost decided judgment in their favour; and he wished the hon. member who had just addressed the House no greater harm than that which the former prophet wished for himself, "1 Let me die the death of the rinhteous and let my last end be like his." Laughter). With regard to the proposition of tho mem0r for North Warwickshire, he must do that hon. gentleman the justice to say that his motion had never been fully and fairly met by those who were opposed to it. The hon. member -held that it was unlawful for a Protestant Legislature to continue this endowment for the education of a Catholic priesthood. Now, proposing to meet this argument fairly, he would submit this counterproposition-that it was unlawful, consistently with the principles of any member of any established church, to wiLthdraw the endowvment granted in this instauce by Sir Robert Peel. The principle that church establishments should exist in this country was a fundamental part of our constitution. Such establishments existed in Scotland, in England, in Iteland, and in all the dominions of the British Crown. They might not always be complete and perfect church establishments, but a permanent endowment provided by the law for the religious instruction of the people existed in every part of the kingdom. Now, the Maynooth endowment was to some extent, a church establishment, for such an establishment must include an adequate provision for the education of the mninisters of religion, and this endowmaent provided for the religions instruction of those wbho it was prowi, must be the pastors of the great majority of the Irish people. Then, if it were a church establishmentait moat betre by the test to 'which such esalih
meuts were alway's subjected-by the test of civil utility. The civil utility to be ans weredl by a church establishment was the preservationi and communication of religions knowledge. A.s Christian men they were not at liberty to subvert this establishment, unless they could provide in a better way for the attainment of the same ends, Or unless their Ilaws had for a length of time been so jusi and equal that Ithe Roman CaSholics-the majority o1 the Irish peoplecoluld, as had been suggested by the hon. member for IHertford, ~r&~vido for the education of their priesthood oat of their private mneans. Ho contended that the laws had
referred to the several acts which had been paswed In regard to this collcexeof Maynooth itself. The first Act, passed in the year 1795, recited that it was not lawful to endow any college or seminary for the education exclusively of persons professing the Roman Catholic religion, and it empowered trustees to receive subscriptions and donations, to purchase land to t'he value of 1,0001. a-year, and to erect buildings. The Act of 1.845 for the first time erected these trustees into a corporation, and empoweredthem to hoMl land to the annual valno of 3,0-001. At the present moment there was no otber institution in connexion wi-th the Roman.Cltholio church in Ireland which enioyed the benefit of incorporation, and there was no Protestant institution which Was limited as to the land which it might'hold. Therival inistitutioni, Trinit Cnllege, Dublin, had aLnannualzerenue of 4000 rmln d given by the, Site, and a-total rovenhte of 7&06 MO per annum;~ and there -were numerous institu-
tionsI in connexion with the Church. of Euglard .1n5 that~ c6uutrywhich-enjoyed all the ben6fiti of larkc revehues-and of incorporation. The hon.'Jind lea?ntbUmfntlmal thaen) proceeded, amid, reaiterated caliLfo-r aIvdison,- to onilimsiate I th ~ai ss edcatona andchaitaleocetle% aonot
moment a Ingle institution identifiod with- te prevaill
creed of the community that possessed the advangexsf lgi ncorporation, ex t the RoyalCollege of Maynooth. He asoaddued authortiest provotho ins'j ble obs§aclec tbrown by Parliament in the way of bequests and donations for Roman Catholic purposes pressng on the attention of the House the circmstance that not later than wthin the last 1: years the pperty bequeathed for chaitable objects by pious man C obeen s
tematially and rigorously con&icated by law. Xe longer ago than, 30 years it was impo befor Roman CAtholics by charitable donations to provide for the endow. ment of their own churches or educational establishments, and that state of things continued until the year preceding the grnt to iynooth. In the ye thieGodernment of Sir R. Peel introduced ea 1B84 the better distribution of charitable bequests in Ireland; but that Bill, although it mimt at first sight appear to be a liberal measure, was in reality r restrictive one, for it applied to Ireland a principle which had never been known there before, which was the principle of the Mortmain Act. It enacted that belnuests for chuitable or religious purposes should only be aid if such bequests had been made within three months of the death of the testator- thus introduciug tho prnciple of the English Mortmain Act into Ireland, where such a principle had never been known before. The withdrawal of the grant from Mlaynooth could not be justified on the ground that the Roman Catholic people were able to endow similar institutions for themselves, still less could it be justified on the ground that the established Church had provided sufflcient spiritual education for the whole people of Ireland, The hon. and learned member was frequently interrupted during the course of his speech by cries of "Question" and "Diride," and at last,
Mr. E. BALL rose to order. The hon. and learned memes speech was a complete mockery. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. Serieaut SHEE was greatly obliged to the hon. gentleman for interfering ina his behalf (laughter), but he did not think that he had been interrupted more than he had often heard the hon. gentleman himself interrupted. It was early as yet (a quarter pasl 12), and he was anxious that the House should not proceedtoa division without being fullyinformed on both the points at issue. (Laughter.) The revenues of the Irish Church were somewhere abont 650,OOO. a-year, but in the most Protestant province of Ireland, Armagh, the members of that Church only nurabered 517,000, while the Roman Catholics were 1,950,OOD and the Pregbyterians 638,000. In the other three provinces, out of a population of 4,817,000 only 84,000 were members afthe estblished Church. Not to go further back than 1DD years (laughter), the churches built by the establishment during that period would not accommodate more than 370,000 persons. They talked of the maintenance of this endowment being a national sin; but if they rendered it impossible for the Romasi Catholic priesthood to be continued in Ireland, by whom were the ordinances of baptism, confirmation, and marriage to be celebrated? He had only one word more to say. (Cheers.) He was obliged to them for that cheerit was the first that he had had the pleasure of receiving and it was perfectly encouraging. In the diseu8sion which took place upon this subject two years ago it was stated by somehon. members that the Catholics did not want this grant. So far from that being correct, he had received letters from the two Primates, in which they stated that they believed the continuance of the endowment to be emsential for the interests of the Rloman Catholic Church and for the provision of the Catholic clergy. ("Divide.")
Mr. NEWDEGATE agreed with the hon. member for Cambridgeshire that a great part of the speech which they had just heard was a mockery. He (Mr. Newdegate) merely rose to sweep away one fallacy which the hon. and learned member who had last addressed them had attempted to impose upon the House. The hon. and learned member had endeavoured to induce them to believe that the BiU which it was proposed to introduce would touch tho property of the corporation of Maynooth. The BiU proposed to do no such thing, but merely to withdraw the endowment from hiaynooth. (Hear, hear.) The hon. member for Mayo had announced to the House that the Administration of the noble lord the member for London fell because the noble lord had dared to pass the Ecclesiastical Titles Act, and he added that no Government could be formed in the conutry cnless it supported the Maynooth grant. Now, he (Mr. Newdegate) called upon the people of England to watch the divisions, and to see whether the House of Commons were as subservient -to the Court of Rome as the hon. member declared that all statesmen who held office in this country were and must be.
Lord PALMERSTON.-I cannot but express the pain which I feel at the renewal of discussions whicb the motion ofthehon.memberfor North Warwickshire opens np. (Hear.) It makes one almost fancy that we have gone back to the period when this House was the arena of contentions between those who were advocates for the removal of the disabilities of the Catholics and those who thought that such removal would be fatal to the constitution of the country. We were told, and I had hoped that when the Cathohc Emancipation Act was carried we should hear no more of these theological and religions debates, and that we sbould know nothing of the religion of any member unless we followed him to his place of worship on a Sunday. (Mear, hear.) I regret exceedingly that those anticipationshave not been fulfilled, andthat we are doomed to these periodical revivals of discussions upon matters which ought to remain a,question between each man and his own conscience, of which his neighbour has no right to be the judge, and in which a deliberative assembly like this ought not, in my opinion, to engage. (Cheers.) I would humbly submit to the hon. member for North Warwickshire that the main ground on which he founds his motion is irreconcileable with those principles which Iconsider that he most. tenaciously holds. The ground on which he restshis motion is that no man ought to contribute towards the maintenance of a religion to which he does not subscribe. Now, isthe hon. member enadvocateforanestablishedchurch? I am sure that heis-I am sure that there is no man who would more fLrmly adhere to the principle of an established church. As the hon. gentleman, then, is a sincere and zealous Protestant, I would ask him, does he adhere to the principle of private judgment-does he believe that everymau should form his religious opinions according to his view of tho truth of the doctrines which he may hold? If he does hold the principle of private judgment, can he believe it possible that in a free country liko this there can he identity of relgious opinions, or that there shall not be a great vanety of religious creeds? The only groand upon which the hon. gentleman could reconcile hi5 adherence to an established church with the principle that no man should contribute to a religion which he does not profess mnst be that there should be an overruling and tyrannical power compelling every man to belong to the EstablisLed Church, and not permitting any diversity of religions opinon in the country. (Hear, hear.) I say, then, that the doctrine of the hon. gentleman is utterly imconsistent with those fundamental principles which I am sure he, as a Protestant and a friend of the Established Church, must necessarily maintain. My objection to the motion of the hon. member, in the first place, is that to abolish the 3aynooth endowment and to repeal the Acts which he wishes us to abrogate would be a breach of faith towards the Irish nation. (Iear, hear.) It is perfectlytrue, as was stated, that the Catholics of Ireland are not dependent upon this grant for the means of educating their priesthood. There is no doubt that the wealth of Ireland would enable them to erect other establishments for the same purposes if the present endowment were taken away; but it would be an ungenerous act-it would be an act indicating a want of sympathy with those who deserve better treatment-it would be a breach of faith as connected with what passed at a former period if we were to adopt the motion of the hon. gentleman and withdraw the Marnooth grant. Upon that ground, if there were no other, I would resist the motion bat I resist it upon a broader ground than that. I resist it for considerations connected with the interests of the British empire. (Hear, hear.) The hon. gentleman has invited me to read all the books of instruction at Maynooth. I certainly have no intention of doing so (a laugh); but, for argument, I will admit his assertion that there may be in those books thmgs which we might vish might not be found there, and I will ask him-Is there in the ordinary instruction of our schools and colleges, and in those dassical books which are used there, nothing to be found which some persons might desire not to be submitted to the eyes and instilled into the minds of the youth of the country? (Hear hear.) Admitting, however, that there are passages in the Maynooth DOORS which in point of doctrine and principle are objectionable, I have that confidence in the people and priesthood of Ireland that I do not fear their loyalty will be impaired by such errors - nor am I ins pOsition to own that the confidence which i place in thom has been at all lessened by the hostile criticisms of the hon. member for North Warwickshire. (Alaugh.) The main ground on which I call upon the Jouse to maintain this vant is a regard for the interests of the united kingdom. 1hold that if the priesthood of Ireland were sent abroad for their education they might receive a better education, but it would be a foreign one, and I wish them tohavean Irish and native education. (Cheers.) I care not what their religious opinions may be. That is for them to determine-not for me. I may differ fromn them on every point of their religious creed, but I bold it to be for the
interests of the country that they should be e educated`at home-that they should be Irishmen in heart and feeling; and as long aUs they receive their instruction in their native
land I am content to treat to the loyalty which belongs to their nation, and never to consent to the repeal of an endowment which is s closly connected with the peace and wellbeing of the empire. (Cheers.)
Mr. SPOONEER, who was received with cries of " Oh," and " Divide," said he rose to answeronly two points in the speech of the noble lord. He held as strongly as the noble lord could do that true Protestant principle of the right of
rivate judgment. He did not wish to deprive the Roman gatholies of the power of exercising their religion; he was willing to leave them in the possession of all their civil rights and to allow them to manage their own education; all he protested against was that Parliament should continue to bolster up and support a church formed in exact opposition to the Established Church. (Haear, hear.) Again, the noblelord had talked of a breach oF faith, althongh he ought to have known that the late Sir Robert Peel and the noble lord the member for the city of London had both declared that the Maynooth grant was a
free gift without conditions, but with expectations which had not been realized. It was not correct, therefore, to say that any breach of faith was involved in the question before the House. ("Divide.")
I& r. FORTESCU, amicd great manifestations of im patience, moved the adjournment of the debate. (Cries of "No !" ana Divide I")
Mr. M OORE saw no reason why the debate should be adjourned, except that some gentleman might apprehend the succestof the motion, ad someits defeat. The pedple of Irelkndw ere-prpapedfor either fortune, and he-hoped the 0overnfientwere so too. (Hear, hear.)

CRIMEAN INQUITY.
Sir A. CAMPBELL rose to move an addres for the copy of a letter from Sir John3l'Neill, G.C.B., toLordPanmure, of the 9th of Februay, 1S56, respecting the services of Colonel Tullooh, and of any reply thereto. When the noble lord at the head of the Government was asked a question the other day with regard to a recognition of the services of the Crimean Commissioners his reply seemed to amount to this, that, notwithstanding their efforts, which led to so many improvements in the condition of our soldiers at Sebastapol, they were, after all, unprofitable servants, and that they ought to be contented with the satisfaction which they must experience at what they had doze. He had no wish to impugn so high an authority with reference to what was the standard of duty and the proper reward, but it appeared to him that there had been an omission in the distribation of revards which almost amounted to a denial of service. He had not only to complain tkat the auswt'r of the noble lord was unsatisfactory, but that what he did say came so tardily and reluctantly as to deprive his words of half their forco. No sort of commendation or approval of the labours of these commissioners or their report had ever emanated from the Government that was not wrung from them by such questions as had been put the other night; and of no spontaneous approbation of their conduct could he recall any instance, unless it was that of Lord Panmure at a publc dinner in Scotlhnd. Now, he understood that shortly after the publication of the report a communication was made by Sir- J. 'NeiUl to Lord Panmure, in which he called attention, not to his own services, for he had no desire and no expectation of any reward for himself, but to the services of Colonel Telloch, o whom, it seemed, some expectations had been held out before his departure for the Crimea of promotion or employment in the army. He was not aware what reply was sent to that letter, and to ascertain this was the object. of his present motion. If an answer was given it would be satisfactory to the House and the country to know what that answer was, and what reasons were 'iven for not adopting the suggestion of Sir J. hV'Neill It could har yDe contended that the correspondence was private. He did not see why there should be any indisposition to produce the answerto the House. TheCrimeancommissioners were selected by the Government; they went out to the Crimea, as he was assured,with great reluctance; they undertook a most diflicult and arduous duty ; they discharged that duty manfuUy and honestly; they investigated the causes of those disasters and horrors whichbad befallen the British army, and which excited so strong a feeling of indignation in this country; theymadesug3estiouswhich were inaeveral instances adopted, andin consequence of those suggestions the sufferings of the army were materiaUy alleviated; they returned to this country, and, so far as he could ascertain, no notice had been taken of thom on the part of Her Majesty's Government. Even if Colonel Tulloch was correct in supposing that a sort of promise of promotion had been held out to him, that reward to which, under such circumstances, he would have had a just claim was denied him. Now, the commissioners either did or did not discharge their duties faithfully. If the Government were of opinion that they had not properly discbarged thosa duties, he thought it was only fair to them and to the people of this country that the points in which they had failed should be stated. If, on the other hand, they had fulfilled the Lexpectations which were entertained of theit-if, despite the difficulties and obstacles they had had to encounter, they had auccessfully discharged the duty intrusted to them-if the result of their inquiries and report had beento ameliorate the condition of the army, and topoint out to those who were at its head the dangers to be avoided in such a winter campaign as that of the Crimea, he thought they ought not on their return to have been reeived in silence, or with cold and reluctant approval, but, tbat no meed of honour and no cordialityof approbation woud have exceeded their deserts. (Hear, hear.) He oegged to move an address to the Crown for a copy of a letter from Sir J. M'Neill, G.C.B., to l,od Panmure, of the 9th day of February, 1856, respectitig the services of Colonel Tullech, and of any reply thereto,
Lord PALMERSTON.-The hon. baronet has not done ustice to Her Majesty's Government in stating that zo acknowledgment of the services of Sir John M'Neill and Colonel Tulloch has been made beyond that which he says was tardily wrung from them, and which they were unable to withhold. .1 stated, -not this session, but last session-in terms which I thought full and ample, the high sense Her Majesty's Clovernment entertained of the services of these officers. They performed a difficult and important duty with great credit to themselves, and witl great advantage to the public service. With regard to the acknowledgment that should be made to them, we are atill in ecommunication with them en that subject. I mnnst, however, object to the motion of the hon. baronet, and on these grounds. A letter was writen by Sir J.
IN'Neill to Lord Panmure, but from circutmstances the only answer given to it was a private note from the private secretary of the noble lord, which was not, and was not intended to be, an official documient. The hon. baronet asks for this correspondence, in order to ascertain whether Sir J. M'Neill recommeuded Colonel Tulloch for military promotion, and what answer was given to that recoeDmendation. I am quite ready to give the hon. baronet as much information as to those two facts as he would possess if the papers were before him. Sir J 3. 'Neiil did undoubtedly recoommend Colonel Tulloch fer promotion, and Her Majesty's Governmnent did aot tltnk fit to adopt the recommendation. Their reason for arriving at this cencluieon was, as I stated on a former occasion, that the services performed by Coloxel Tulloch were purely of a civi} nature, and that military rank was notan appropriate acknowledguent of civil services. Ceoonel Tbloch gad alreadLyattained theorank of colonel by merits of his own, not in consequence of service; and it was thought that it woul not be consistent with a due regard for the interests of the service to give hint, the rank of major-general for his services in counexion with the Crimean commission. Had we done so we must have placed him over the heads of severalvery distinguished officers who served in the field in the Crimea, and they would have had ground to complain that this eisil officerfor so I must call him with regard to the service he performed-had been promoted over the heads of those who brA been actually engaged in the field against the enemy. I give the hoa. baronet the furl benefit of the facts that Sir J. M'Neili did reconmmend Colonel TUloch for military promotion, and that we did not think it consistent with our duty that military rank should be giren for such a description of service. The hen. baronet has stated that expectations were held ont to Colonel Tnlloch that he woud receive military promotion. I have no
owledge of such an intimation; but, whetler such expectations were held out or not, I think it would have been improper to make Colonel TuUloch a major-general for the per formance of civil duties, ho wever wtell he mayr have perfhme thoe dtie, an hovevr vavt3}e is services
Mr. S. HERBERT thought there was some misapprehension on the part of his noble friend with regard to the past services of Colonel Tulloch. The noble lord seemed to say that Colonel TuUloch had already received such promotion that he could not now be further advanced, and that that officer haid never seen serice in the field. The fact was, however, that Colonel Tulloch had served in the Burmese war,wvhere he greatly distinguished himself. Colonel TnUoch subsequently rose by his merits, and had rendered very efficient services to the public. With respect to the reward that might be given to Colonel TnUoch for the discharge of his difficult duty in the Crimea, which had undoubtedly been attendcd with great advantage tothe army, he (Mr. Herbert) would say nothing, because the noble lord had informed the House that the Government were in communicationvwith Sir J. M'NeillandIColonellTullochonthatsubject. (Hear.) Be would therefore only express his hope that these offcers would receive some suitable acknowledgment for the services they had rendered. (Hear, hear.)
General CODRINGTON was understood to express his opinion that if Colonel Tuoch had been~ promoted to the rank of major-general for serdces per,'ormed in a civil capacity, many officers who had commanded battalions throughout the siege of Sebastopol, and who had not received such promotion, would have had grounds for dissatisfaction.
Sir A. CAhMPBELL said, after tho statement of the noble lord he would not press his motion.
The motioni was then, by leave, withdrawn.

were between a man ind ais aker; and, if anotber ruan reproached his fellow on that head hewent be~yond the power which any human bewnggoesssed, or ouglit to posses Nothing but wealmes in midaand bigotry in his heart could induce the hon. gentleman to act so. (Cheers.) Hlaving dealt wit te ho oiy and Justice of the case, the kigher doctri~ne of morality remained-that, in all questions of religion, the leading principle oughit to be to ive to every individual ower and right to judge for himself. (Hear.) Was thelHouse of Commons to enter into a6theologi. cal controversr.? He was a professor of the faith of the established Chure , and such he intended to remain, but he did not take on himself to catechize or school other men for dissentin from the Churcb. There were many hon. friends of his who called themselves Protestant Dissenters, and he regarded the Catholics as Catholic Dissenters. (furmuns from Irish members.) He knew tey would repudiate the term, but he stated it without intending offenoe, that, as a pzofessor of tho Church established by law, he believod everybody who depu-ted from it to be a Dissenter. (Hear. )
He believed that the high doctrines of morality should induce them to bear with each other on qestions connected with.religion, that mnotion, which muslsirritate and insult were uanwise, anjust, and unchristian, andthat, if they were to be repeated from time to time ;as they had been in the
ltfear years, the HEouse ought to ex:press a strone feeling, as he sincerely believed they would to-night, by placing the hon. member in a decided minority. (Cheers.)
Hr. BOWYER aereed with the hon. and learned member for Sheffield that that House was not the place for theological discussion. It was easy for any one to take passages
from the writers quoted by the hon. member (Mx. Spooner), I andby interpreting them as he pleased to extractfrom them doctrines that were not the doctrines of the writers of these books. The distinction between mortalandvenijlsins had also been adverted to i but was it possible to disnss such a subject in that House It was unfair to suppose that because the woman Catholic Church declared certain sins to be veial they were therefore of no consequence at aIL There were crimes of various degrees of gravity in the eye of the law, and there were also sins of different degrees of gravity in the eye of the church. The hon. member sid that temporal laws were not valid if they differed from the laws of the Roman Catholic Church. BuO if the hon. member studied the subject fairly, he would see the qualificatipus with which this doctrine was held, and that every Prokstant held it as wel as Roman Catholics. Even Dissenters would hold it their duty to obey God before man. The hon. member would find in the Bible a narrative of three Jews who were required by the laws of their chuich to say their prayers in a particular time and manner. They were forbidden to do so by the temporal rules, and they were punished for disobeying the temporal law. Eut they were now held forth as men wvho suffered for the truth. Would the bon. gentleman say that practically Roman Catholics were less good subjects than Protestants? Lookatthemin peace andwar. Itwas said that Roman Catholics were not bound by the sacredness of oaths ? Did they not remem'eer the time when Roman Catholics were excluded from that House, from civil offices, and even from holding commisions in the army, because they would not takeanoath. (Hear.) Thehon.memberfor Dung
van bad stated in the course of the previous debate that the Roman Catholics objected to paying mini3ters' money for a relion that they did not believe in, and the hon. memberf for North Warwickshire argued that by the same reasoning Trotestantsobjected topaytaxesforMaynooth. Theargument was specious, but unsound. The college was founded, not as a favour to the Roman Catholics, but upon grounds of public policy, and it was a small and miserable coin pensation for tho lOEss of the ecclesiastical property which once belonged to the Roman Catholics. The hen. gentleman told the House tha, the Queen in her coronation oath swore to support the Protestant constitution. She did nothing of the sort. She took an oath to support the church as by law established, but there was mot one word about the Protestant constitution in the coronation oath. The hon. member had spoken of this as a Protestant country, but he (Mr. Bowyer) denied that this was a Protestant country, because there were people who were not Protestants in it. But Ireland was a Roman Catholic country. A small section of the population, perhaps about 800,00, belon-ed to the Protestant h~urch, but 6,000,000 or 7,OZ0,000 were Roman Catholics, and the hon. gentleman would not deny that an overwhelming preponderance of the Fopulation were members of that church. It was proved before the select committee that sat two years ago that every chargeraade against Maynooth that disloyal and dangerous doctrines wrtahtthere were utterly groundless. The hen. member ad said something about Jesuitism; but he would tell thehon. inemberwh,ta Jesuit was. (Hear.) When Dr. Johnson was talked to about Jesuits h got impatient and sid,"A Jesuit iammauwbo isa cleverer feUlowthanthe oce vwho caLs him so." ("Hear"from the Oppositionbenches.) Although in that sense many of the witnesses examined before the committee were Jesuits, yet in the proper sense of the -word there was not a single Jesuit examined. Th'e witnesses on whom the hon. gentleman relied were tmen who had been driven from the church on account of ofrences against its discipline. Was the evidence of such men to weigh against that of professors of Oaneoothegentlemen ppointed by the Crown, and as loyal as any beobmeor of ta House t (Hear, hear.) Some of f thto gentlemen had expiessed opinions which he thouigt were not ultramontane eonoug. When he was stayin at the cellege at the time the commaittee was sitting. e told some of the pro. feors that many of the answers they were prepared to give contained rather greater concessions than he shouldrbe disposed tomake. Butfortheo hn. gentlemantocharge that lIlaynooth was ultramontane was perfectIlygroundless; it bad nothing to do with ultrarnortanismn. Me would give a
cnen of the absurd answenr of the itnesses upon whot e evdence the.aon. gentleman relied. One of them sad that the priest were not loyal, because before praying for the Queen they took off the manut only one of the eoclesiastical vestments not dernvedl from Numa, Pompilius H 3e would not trespass longer on the House, because he di not wish to enter into a discussion upon articles of faith and theologica questionsr-mattors nite unfit to be considered by suTca'asserably. Hetruste~dthat the House wouldre. ject the hon. gentleman's propoeal bysuhia majority as would disfourage him from aganl opening discussions of this idnd, which were most nauseous, not only to the Roman Cathoic, but to many of the Protestant moembrs, who, although they might be compelled by the bigotry and ignorance of their constituents to vote aegaint Maynooth, disapproved the bitterness and imopriety with which the hon. member for North WarwSio hire, and somne of the hon. gentlemln who sat behind him, setaed their views upon this subject.
Mr. T. CHAMBERS was desirous of making a few renorks in reply to the observations of the lbon, and learned 3member for Sheffield (Mr. Roebuck), which were more worthy of notice from tho position and character of that hon. gentleman than from their own intrinsic force. The hon. and learned member began bytdraw ig a distinction between the speech of the hoen, membe for North Warwick. shire u(r. Spoouer) and that of the hon. member for Cornwall (Mr. Kendall), who seconded it with a view of showing that the taste of the seconder ws better thani that of the mover. It appeared to him (Mr. Chambers) therevwas no force in those observationsd wADmatter pertinent to the subject under discussion was always in taste. (Hsear, hear.) Certainly the last man to complain of unpalatable truths or unpalatable fictions (hear) was the hon. member for Sheffield. (Hear.) The hon. gentleman denied that theMatynooth
nt was intended as a protection agains Ultramontane To,trines, but said it was really intended as a protection against the spreasd of Gallicdn sentiments during the French re-volstion. That was part of the truth, hut not the whole truth. Before 1793 it was contrary to law to educats the Roman Catholic priesthood in Ireland, and they went abroad to obtain the education which was deied them at home. That beame ilegal and limposible when the revolutionary war broke outS; and what, then, was the statedof the case? It was illegal to educate priests at home, and it was illegal and impossible to educate them abroa. PThere was then a Protestant Parliament in Ireland, and tbe Government consented to the endowmegnt of Mayno-hth * CoUlege, in order that the Ronan Catholic riesthood might not ube comperled to go abroad. rely such a state of facts did not support the conclusion that, therefore, the endowment to Maynooth maust be continued. Then, -with respect to the uniion, the hon. member for Sheffield had stated that it was cemnt
by the transmission of the Mayneooth endowmient. That was one of the melancholy leacies of Mr. Pitt. (Hear.) Butwaseth statement true? ventwere itntrue, this ountry was not obliged to adopt the legacy-damnlosaernedimem. But the terms of the union were that all assistance given to
lios and charitable institutions in Irelad rhould not xbee =tubed for 20 years, hut surely that argu-ment must now be nearly 50 years hahind date. Another argument of -the hon. and learnecdmember for Sheffield was that for centuries this country had been attempting to perbecutpothe 2Roman Catholics in Ireland. Adnitting there had been persecution, it had been cruel, abominable, maischievous, and entirelyuseless. (Ilear. hear.) Still that had nothing to do witi Maynooth. The hon. and learned mem. ber for ShefiEeld had also declared that it was their interest .to keep the peace between the Roman Catholies and the Protestants of Ireland, buit the truLth was, there 3never would be peace between them so long as this endowment existed, The decson of the country', not based noon
any mixture of metaphysics and theology, but UpOn a strong
sense of principle, had been arrived at long ago. Peace would be maintained by abolshing the grant. Some returns which had been recently laid before the House showed that therewas not a complete knowledge of the fu{l amounts voted for geigions pvrposes, and the general feeling of the House an the country undoubtedly was that such grants should not be encouraged in future. (Hear, hear.; He (Mr. Chambers) would not rashly touch all existing endowments, but be did strongly protest against their extension. Another argument advanced by the Ion. anid "leaned member for Sheffield was tbat Irelanri balt- been a great sapcort to this country He (MIr. ChOpb,101 admitted that reland was row
ron, a&~oti0#bfn, but it should be remembered t."n
JfOrcintW40of 1848, the great mover (Sir R. Peel),

lis intitrton~~eodn bavIe 12 or 15 year, he wouj'd ask, had th~4sWc~e bee attained? (Hear.) He would
contbras the 17d i thAnd rmoral attitude of the Roman
Catolls i 17~wil~that which led to the Papal aggres-
rstion, an event -Oli ad not occurred since the
ReformatOD. TkOe cOllege which was to produce pnests favourable t "nglish institutions had had a Cardinal Wisetnau sr, a Roman Catholic hierarchy, in despite of the SoYereign. In making these remarks, he had said nothing sga)nat Roman Catholics. No doubt could exist th'-y wre 'ittitled to the freeest exercise of tbeir Torship, and be would not have omplained of the Paal aggreesion i'it could have been Xhown to be necessary in order at Romsa Catholics night receive aU the sactaments an comforts of their churce. (" Hear," from Mr. BowyOr. 9uc6h was not the case, and a Pro.
tes4altt House Of bombton3, bound to manutain* Protestant constitbtion, was com relIed to resist such *at.resdon "There are higher ;ooal considerations," said aggedond learned member for Sheffield, " thu any introduced by the hon. zember who mads the present motion, and iny religion teahes- giM not to set Mnyself up as a judge and condemner of any tuan."

In the House of Lords last night :
Lord. CrOAwrPsxL gave noticd t,hit,o6h ThuAd nee;t he'wonid move for- a wleot committeat , oo
alder w iebher the priyileges DOiQ eXlJoyea u-ith reg&rd to the reports .of proceqdinooie0xrts4o
justice may be safely an4 prgpBr1y exte -~~t
kepozts of proceedings il the two Houses of Parliainent, and to any and what other assemblies or public meetings, under any and what conditions -and resictions.
After a discus,non between Lorjls GREY and GRANr,r aS to the register of the Jorcha Arrow,
Lord DE;n,Y read the resolution which he ini'
ltended to move on Tuesday next, condemnatory of the polity pursued by the Britis2b auithorities in 'binWWth regardto thie hostilities aat Canton.
The Marquis of CLAwRICARDE, i; a lengthened ;peeoh, called attention to the evils arising out of
aie double government of our Indiani possessions, -Bnd concluded by moving that the system under 'tWbich the government of HER MA.i STY'S terri*orieK is administered in India is n) longer suit;able to the condition and prospects of that vast -empire, or the development of its rcsources and '4he improvement and welfare of its inliabitants.
ITe T Duke of AnoxTr defended the existing system -of Indian government, and asserted that discussions oh Incdiana'af'airs ought to be taken - ri substantive propositions, and not on abstract resol-itions, such *als that proposed by Lord OLANRIXAIUA)ER, which were ;mtot calculated to produce any practi.;l good.
' The motion was then withdrawn, adti their Lord-ships adjourned.
In the House of Commons, in reply to Sir J.
;Lord PAhi=RsTow stated that no agreement had yet been come to with the Goverunlenlt of Denmark -.*pecting the comrmutation of the Siwitd Dues, but
lid expected that an arrangement woJld be con-eluded very speedily.
In answer to Mr. LAYAnD,
Lord PALvrERSTONr said Her Majesty's Government had no knowledge of the treaty rt-1; rted to have been concluded between Russia and P'ersia on the -5th of January.
Mr. L. KrIG moved forleave to bring in aBillto -snake the franchise in counties it England and Wales the same as that in boroughs, by giving the right of voting to all occupiers of tenements of the .annual value of 101. Its main object, he said, was -to carry out a great constituitional principle, recog,nized in the Reform Bill, that taxati. n and repreaentation should go more together. 1 t did not propose to disfranchise a - single bcrongh or a single Imcdividual; it adopted the only mode of dealing with the great qtiestion of the franchise-that of -treating al parties with equal justice.
Lord PAi-VroToN could not consent to the intro-duction of this Bill. Independently of objections -to the Bill itself considering the busi8ness before the House, he thought there was lit.le prospect of its passing. With regard to the piunciple of the smeasure, he did not concur in the arguinent that the right of voting should be the same in boroughs and counties. He thought that there were reasons for 3naintaiinig a distinction; that eachi represented different in'terests in the community. The logical consequence of adopting this measure would be the sweeping avway of all boroughs, for why should the artificial distinction and circumscriptio,n of boroughs be kept up ? In objecting to the principle of the Bill, and to the consequences to which it must lead, he did not express, he said, any opinion that there should be no extension of the franchise in c; -unties; on the contrary, he should be ready to consider a more modified measure. He therefore didi not set his face against an improvement of our representative . system.
After a few remarks by Mr. HE1,bLA_M and Mr. I'RtMblOND in support of the Bill.
Lord J. RussELL said that he did not think the -Government ought to allege that there would not be time for the discussion of the measure; and, with regard to the measure itself, aft-er the change introduced in the county constituencies by the CHASOS clause of the Reform Bill, whereby occupancy as well as tenure gave a right of voting, he -could not but think that this measure was a safe
improvement, and that it would tend to consolidate .our institutions. He was prepared, therefore, not only to vote for the introduction of the bill, but to support its second reading.
Some observatious were made Mr. BEYTmrcK and Mr. T. D1.NcoMDz.
Sir J. GRABA&t stated the grounds upon which he supported this proposal on the present occasion. The argument against a change in the Reform Bill on the plea of finality he now thought invalid, but the extreme diiculty of carring a large and comprehensive change rendered such a measure, in his opinion, not likely to be successful. One of the measures of Lord ABnDED?BB's Administration was a Bill to enlarge the fianchise, wvhich was framed with great caution by the Cabinet of Lord ABER3DREN, and, having been introduced by Lord J. RussELv, it was withdrawn on account of the war. ln that measure, among other provisions, was introduced the precise proposition of Mr. Kime, with countervailing provisions. EIis belief was that the measure would extend the franchise, in a manner perfectly safe, to men capable of independent action; and if he was to take a fragment of reform *he was bound to conr,ider what was, at the same time, the safest and the largest measure. Looking at the question in this light, he believed this to be a measure that might be most safely introduced, and lie did not hesitate to give his vote for its introduction.
Mr. S. B ERnERT said, after the deepest consideration of the subject, he saw two distinct grounds for not giving his sup rt to the motion; first, the state of parties in the House, and, secondly, the form of the question. It was true that the proposition was contained in the Bill prepared by Lord ABERDEEN'S Administration; it was, however, not only brought forward by the leader of the Government in that House, btit it was supported with the whole weight of the autho-ity of the Government, and it was -coupled with other provisions which tended to neutralize its effect, and to extend the value of the measure. tle thought the present Government had exercised a wise discretion in not bringing forward -questions which, in the existing position of parties, it nmight be diflicult to carry, and he -did not wish to pnt ttem into greater difficulties. Under these circumstances, guarding himself against being supposed to express any opinion as to the extension of the francbise, upon the grounds he had stated he felt it his duty to oppose the motion.
After some remarks by Mr. ROEBCcK in reply to Mr. S. BERPn,RT at whose speech he declared he was astousded, the House divided, when the motion 'was negatived by 192 to 179.
Mr. FAGAN moved for leave to bring in a Bil to -abolish the tax called Ministers' Money, imposed on -eght corporate towns in Ireland.
Mr. lloisxAt- explained the present position of 'this oft-agitated question, and stated that thematter was under the consideration of the Government, whose intentions in regard to it he hoped to be able to state on the second reading of the bill.
A discussion succeeded, in which Mr. BAGWE LL, Mr. NAPIE}t, 3r. BOWYER, Mr. MVIITESIDE, and other Iribh umembers took part, and leave was given 'to introduce the Bill.
Mr. SPoONER moved a resolution,-"cThat this House do resolve itself into a committee for the pturpose of considering the Acts for the endowment of the College of Maynooth, with a view to the
withdrawal of any endowment out of the consoli-dated fund, due regard being had to vested riahts -or intere,ts." He consideIed, he said, that it-was his imperative duty, as it was that of every Protestant .and of every member of that House who had takea -an oath of allegiance to the QUEEN, to object to a -continuaulce of any payment to the College of Idaynooth. After complaining of the unfair tactics which bad been emploYed on former occasions to ,defeat his purpose, he recapitulated his reasons for opposing tlse grant, his chief objection being that it was a natioiial sin. The Commissioners, he contended, had been misled, and their conclusions were unsupported by evidence. He adverted, as upon preceding occasions, to doctries alleged to be incul-cated by the Roman Church-noticing the struggle ;lbetwreen the Gallican and the Ultramontane parties, -wd aFked the Rouse whether it was prepared to sanviion a teaching which, he insisted, among other .objectionable matters, postponed duties due to the SovzIONG to obligations imposed by the Church,
The motion was seconded by Mr. EPENALL.
Mr. RoEuucK, declining to discuss questions of theology, charged Mr- SPOMi-z with error in his historical account of the establishment of Maynooth. He (Mr. RoEBucx) maintained that the grant was founded in justice, policy, and the highest
principles of morality. The college was created for English purposes. T.he Eglish Parliament had
sustained it for such purposes. As a matter of -9.oicy, it wras the bounden duty of Parliament to merndet- the feelings of the Roman Catholics of Ireland,
whose loyalty was unimpeachable, and-not to insult them.
Mr. BowyEB, while he protested against theological discussion in that House, replied to some of Mr. SrOONIR'S allegations as to the doctrines of the Roman Church, and denied the charge of Ultramontanism brought against the College of Maynooth.
Mr. T. CQIAMBERs animadverted with some severity upon certain parts of the speech of Mr. ROEBUcK, who, he said, had not accurately stated the origin and history of the Maynooth grant. He contended that ihis was a plain question of morals and policy, well understood by the people of England, who would insist upon the repeal of the endowment.
Mr. Serjeant O'BrExN said the Roman Catholics of Ireland viewed this motion as a violation of a right guaranteed to them by a solemn Act of the Legislature, continued for 60 years, and therefore as an act of un%varrantable injustice, rendered more galling by unfounded charges against their faith. It could not be shown that the exercise of the privileges conceded to the Roman Catholic laity had beeniniurious to England; their loyalty was therefore a sufficient vindication of the character of their priesthood. He trusted that the House would not, by sanctioning the motion, reverse a policy adopted by successive Administrations, and adopt a mesaure that, although exasperating in its result. would prove powerless but for evil, by creating in the minds of the people of Ireland a deep sense of wrong.
Mr. G. MOORE warned the advocates of the motion of its effects, if carried to its conclusion, upon another establishment in Ireland. The paltry grant was, he observed, only a smaU boon given to the I;ish Roman Catholics in return for the property taken from their church, and it was given for British purposes.
nIr. DR1tuhION-D said the question divided itself into two verv distinct aspects. In the political aspect it was a bargain which could not be honestly broken; and was Mr. SPOoNER aware that he was asking the House to begin a new course of policy towvards the Irish? Upon the theological aspect of the question Mr. DitUXMOND, apparently to the surprise of the House, pronounced a warm eulogium upon the Church of Rome, declaring that he would do anything rather than it should go down.
Mr. Serjeant SHEB asked the House to consider, before this endowtment was withdrawn, whether justice had been done to the Roman Catholics of Ireland by their being, equally with the Protestants, alloved to provide for the education of their priesthood; and he showed that before 1795 such establishments were illegal, and that since then restrictions were imposed upon Roman Catholic institutions which did not apply to those of other subjects of the CROw-N.
MIr. NEWDEGATE briefly supported the motion.
Lord PALMERSTOx expressed regret and pain at the renewal of these discussions of matters which ought to remain between man and his own conscience. He submitted to Mr. SPooNER that his motion was irreconcileable with those fundamental principles which, as a friend of the Established Church, he could not but recogiuze. He must maintain that no man ought to contribute to the maintenance of a religion to which he did not subscribe. Could he suppose that there could be in such a country as this an identity of religious opiniions ? His (Lord PALMERSTON'S) objections to the motion were-first, that to abolish this endowment and to repeal the Act would be a breach of faith towards the lrish nation, and on that ground alone he would resist the motion. But he resisted it on a broader groumd-namely, the interests of the British empire. If the endowment wvere withdraLwn the edlucation of the priests would be a foreign education ; he preferred that they should be educated at home.
Upon a division the motion was negatived by 167 to 159.
After some further business, the Eouseadjourned at 20 minutes past 1 o'clock.
From the public at large there has not been one
From the public at large there has not been one word of objection to the Budget. There are people who think that this duty, or that, might have been considered; that the declining scale of* tea duties might have been quickened, or paper relieved; but the inmediate ceesation of the war iinepence and the limitation of the remnaiEn'g sevenpence to three years have left little spare interest for tea or for paper. The reduction of the Navy and War Estimates at once from tbirty-seven millions to nineteen was an agreeable surprise, we wiU venture to say, to everybody. For these necessary evils we are to pay the next year only about half as much as we did last. On the face of it who can deny this to be what is called a sweeping reduction? There must be a decline and fall in all things before they settle at their lowest, even in military and naval establishments The affairs of the world require measure and time. We can't jump into security or right otur finances at a single jerk. It may be never too late to mend, but our system is venerable, dignified, and unwieldy, and must takle its own time even for econony. The watchful common sense of the nation, however, did not expect a greater reduc'bion than to half the present year's expenditure. Yet, certain political engineers, who, if they would confess the honest truth, were as mrach surprised as anybody at the amount of the reduction, after no end of conferences, have come to the conclusion that this is the point et which the Budget can be most easily breached. Half a dozen sections of the political world have agreed to sink dilTerences on this common ground. A. has met B., and B. has conferred with C.; and 0. has got over D.'s antipathies to B., so A. and E. have been arianging matters. So far as regards the personages themselves, it promises to be a most comprehensive coalition, though there is an unfortunate dearth of followers and absence of principles. The latter, indeed, are carefully eschewed, for fear they. should disturb the beautiful simplicity of this arithmetical concordat. The broad basis of comprehension is, that the national defences can be done at a lower figure than Sir GxoacGX C. LEwIs has put them at. You have only to subscribe to a certain moderate opinion expressed in £. s. d., and out of that low figure you may make for yourself a high one. Such is the ground of the attack to be made upon the Budget tonight, apd it will be very odd indeed if half a dozen ex-Premiers and ex-Chancellors of the Exchequer do not hit on some blot or other in a financial statement winding up the accounts of a very costly war.
The offer of cheapness, of course, is always plausible. We should not see half the linendrapers' shops ticketed with goods at 1lid., or 5:ld., or 2s. Ild., or " only 19s. 9d.," if there was not a numerous class always intent not so much on absolute cheapness as on the comparatives of cheapness. Thf.y always want sometbing cheaper; -cheaper than common, cheaper than their neigbhouSs, cheaper than the last article of the kind; cheaper than the cost, cheaper than it ought to be. Husbands know best whetber this tends to real economy in the end. Because Sir G. C. LxEwis offers the national defences for this next year at nineteen millions, a new firm is about to open a shop over the way with the same article at eighteen or seventeen and a half. Had the original offer been twenty two they would probably have been content to offer it at twenty. Sensible people meet bids of this sort by looking back at the performances of the bidders, at the wear, for example, of an iarticle bought cheap. It was under Mr. GLA.DSTONE'S auspices that we began the war, and at the time we deprecated his illusion of paying for it out of revenue. In reason, the only rule. for the expenses of a war is the means necessary to insure success, and any other rule is irrelevant and fantastic. We are decidedly of opinion that Mr. GLADsToxgs misapplication of economy at that mrisis contributed to the early disasters of the war; and tlhat under his inspiration subordinates, and perhaps eo11eaguea, were thiking of saving a IwD thqu.
sands, here and there, when they ought to have been thinldkg chiefly, if not only, of immediate [nnd sufficient reinforcements and suppEes. his economy, then, having, AS we believe, proved false on that occasion, may wel be suspected when it is promised, not to keep in a Ministry, but to trip one up. But is this a time to cut things down to the lowest possible scale ? We have two wars, for wars they are, and quite capable of expansion to any scale that may be desired. Happily at this moment India has no war of her own, but her army, native and British, is not excessive. There are not $0,000 Europeans out there in both services, and hatdly a regiment of them can be spared for China, where at the last date operations were at a stand for want of men. Yet our empire in the East, we are always told, hangs upon prestige, and, like a rocking stone, trembles at a touch. At home, Europe is not in quite so profound a repose as she has been at times during the last forty years. We may any day want an army and a navy. Experience proves that we cannot create either of them out of nothing whenever we may happen to want it. We have just been in al kinds of difficulties and troubles through our want of soldiers; and our great failure at Sebastopol was immediately owing to the newnews of the force to which we committed the crowning act of the war. On the other element, no sooner was the Admiral afloat than he pronounced the whole fleet, officers and men, utterly ignorant of their work, and he has repeatedly expressed bis satisfaction that the honour of England was never staked on such crews. They were mostly landamen or sailors of the lowest order, with just a nucleus taken from the Coastguard, at immense wages. Now, if we are to have a fleet we must have men, and, if men, they qught to be fit for their work, and that the very moment they are wanted. The time when fleets and armies are most wanted is the very instant that the war breaks out. Forthcoming at the proper place and time they are worth anything; when the war is ended they are lumber; but they tell for double their intrinsic strength. if they are always beforehand with the foe. These considerations are not addressed to the sensibilities of the Peace Society, but the present state of Europe and of the whole world does not allow us to reject them.
We happen just now to have a remarkable corroboration of an estimate for which we were held answerable, and which was indignantly and circumstantially denied by Mr. GT ADSToNn and Lord JonN RussELI. Two years ago our correspondents in the Crimea stated that the effective force before Sebastopol had been reduced to 12,000 or 13,000 men. On Mr. RiciI and other members pressing for some satisfaction on this point Mr. GLADSTONE asserted that at the last date there were 28,200inthe discharge of militaryduties before Sebastopol. This he said twice over; and after another interval he repeated that, " exclusive of "sick at Balaldava and elsewhere, there was an " effective British force of 28,200 men, inde"pendently of 3,000 or 4,000 Marines and the "Naval Brigade." Lord JoHN R-ussELL went more into the returns than lift. GLADSTONE considered it his place to do, and, throwing in Artillery, Cavalry, officers, and men employed in various duties not strictly military, found the total effective force to be 28,000 or 30,000 men, whom, on the authority of a private informant just returned from the Criniea, he stated to be " in possession of all their strength, and ready " to perform any duty that might be required of "them." Ours, too, was not the only army, Lord Jonw said, before Sebastopol ; the French had .80,000 men, and he assumeea they would take care that our men, whether many or few, should not be overworked. It was with reference to our statements on this and other questions arising olut of the siege that Lord JoHN had to avow the. " disgust" excited in his sensitive mind, and to' warn the House against being misled by the " ribald press." Two years have since passed, and it is still believed in some quarters that on that occasion we met with an authentic confutation and a just rebuke. Only yesterday, however, there appeared in these columns a letter from Colonel WETHERALL, Deputy-Adjutant, General during the period in question, an officer certainly vith no prejudice in our favour. Writing for the purpose of proving that Colonel TiLocH expected more from the army than it could possibly do, he says that in the week between the 22,d of December and the 1st of January, which, according to the dates, was the very time alluded to, " the effectives appear "to have been 13,161 ; the duties furnished, ex"clusive of ' fatigues,' were 7,177 daily ;" and Colonel WNETHEEAL's conclusion is,. that "there "were only 13 men available on paper in the " whole army to be sent to Balaklava on any day " of the week selected." Here, then, is at last an official and indisputable confirmation of our statement,-a proof how little Mr. GLADSTONE and Lord JomN RUSSELL then knew, or chose to know, on the subject, about which they were prepared to speak so positively. The British public will think twice, we suspect, before they will agaill adopt the interested estimates of those who so greatly underrated the emergency and overrated the means left to meet it. It is true there is no imnmediate danger of such another emergency, but it is only for the case of such emergencies that .ve keep our army and navy at al. The question )f Estimates is a continual one, and as grave a ,ne in peace, or what is called peace, as in actual war; and we see as much danger in the ala^srity with which some of these gentlemen would give us low Estimates now as there was in their answering so promptly for the sufficiency of our forces before Sebastopol.
The House of Commons has shown an almost
The House of Commons has shown an almost precocious decision of character by rejecting in one evening two motions long fatal to its peace and reputation. From two very opposite quarters Mr. Locxz KmG and 3Ir. Sroo?z have reappeared on their old hobbies,-the former the assimilation of the County and Borough Franchise, the latter the withdrawal of the Grant to Maynooth. It is quite sufficient for us that neither of these measures has the smallest chance of success, the Lords alone being quite able to preserve the County Franchise in its present integrity, and neither House being at present prepared for war to the knife with the Roman Catholics of Ireland. Some day or other, doubtless, the County Franchise may share the benefit of a general measure, and at a later period it is po8sible we may make some arrangement with the Irish priesthood that will save us from the inconsistency of first educat;ng and training them into a high state of efficiency, and then sending them empty into the field, like foxhounds, with an appetite for the chase. The opportunity, however, is not yet come, and it is a mere waste of invaluable time to spend night after night in fruitless debates on such subjects. Lord JoN RussEmL has not proved either his sagacity or his influence by first backing up Mr. Loom K.G and then suffering defeat. Mr. SPooNEm almost mnonopolizes the glory of his crusade and the dis-grace of its failure. These two gentlemen, who have probably no great opinion of each other, should bottle up their oddities for the present. Both the Franchise anI lvIaynooth will keep,indeed, tbhy will be ihe better for keeping; and, when *q long-expected day comes at last, Mr. Lo(.R; - &G a4 ooz will be Wtmaed tq
with much greater pleasure if they have not said I the very same things every Session before for a
dozen years.
No result of the late war has been more remark-
No result of the late war has been more remarkable than the promptness with which the attention of English capitalists has been turned to the, resources of the Turkish Empire. If we wish to measure the evil inflicted on the Ottoman State by the former preponderance of the CzAR, we have only to compare the present time with the period before the war. Then every zcheme of improvement was rejected in obedience to impulses communicated from St. Petersburg. Not only was there a party among the Pashas which adopted blindly every Russian suggestion, but the Western nations were so accustomed to regard the country as onlyhalf independent that no one would risk his means in any enterprise which could be supported only by a decaying people and a tottering Government. Peace has not yet been concluded 12 months, and already the indefatigable energy of Englishmen has roused the empire from its lethargy of ages. Without in any way interfering with the SuriT's authority, nay, while supporting his legitimate influence and accepting as a reality his admissnion into the brotherhood of Sovereigns, the English people have set practically to work to introduce into his dominions those material improvements which are the only sure foundation of progress and civilization. It may be a question whether the hopes of speculators may not be too sanguine, and whether modest schemes may not be found the best for a country which has yet to learn the rudiments of commerce and to receive as a new faculty the spirit of enterprise. Bat success is only a matter of time, and in a few years we have no doubt that railways, telegraphs, and steamboats will have developed in those highly favoured regions a priosperity which will prove the best defence of the empire in times to come.
However, it appears that the enterprise of our countrymen has raised the usual feeling of rivalry among the citizens of other States. Englishmen have received concessions for the Euphrates Valley Railway, the Smyrna and Aldin Railway, the railway from the Danube to the Archipelago, for the Imperial Bank, the telegraphs from Constantinople to Bagdad and Alexandria. They are working mines in various parts of the country; they meditate warehouses on the Golden Horn, and building sheds on the Bosphorus. All these things move the anger of the foreign world, and particularly of some ardent spirits among our allies the French. What right have the Islanders to extend their yoke over an empire in which all the world is interested? What will become of the proper influence of other nations if England succeeds in subjecting Turkey to a degrading financial dependence ? We are evidently wishing to establish ourselves throughout, the Ottoman empire as we have done in so many parts of the globe, and to reap' the harvest which has been sown by the labours of an alliance of nations. If, it is said, Turkey continue to preserve a nominal independence, it will not be the less at the mercy of the people who hold its means of communication, are its bankers and chief merchants, its creditors and its advisers in all internal affairs. The contrast between the position of this country now and its position two years ago makes the fretfulness and surprise of the French 'Levantines easily understood. We have not all perished in the Crimea. England is not a minor State, a mere boat in the tow of the French first-rate. The Turks are not converted to the belief that only two' empires of impor ance exist in Europe, ---France, their friend and natural adviser; and Russia, from whom France will protect them. Jesuits and Lazarists are mortified to find that a Power which has no sympathy with their propaganda still influences the Councils of Constantinople, and that even the Christians of the empire are beginning to recognize in England an honest and disinterested adviser. A letter which appears in our French correspondence expresses sufficiently this bitterness of feeling. It is in tone French, but French of the East. It speaks as those are accustomed to speak who have watehed for years the struggles of rival Embassies, and cannot conceive that one of the leading nations can obtain any concession or privilege without something being lost to its rival. That we should have been fortunate enough to receive permission to construct certain public works is to the writer proof that in some way France has been outwitted or injured, and he accordingly caUs upon his countrymen aud the Government to counteract our policy, which he presumes to be elazborate and perfidious.
Now, the whole matter is simple enough. The people of this country want no accession of tenitory at the expense of Turkey, nor do they wish to influence the counsels of the PORTE, except that they may insure its stability and independence and promote the prosperity of the people. But our capitalists and men of enterprise have gone to Turkey because they see in it a country of great capab;lities, where money and induistry judiciously invested may bring large returns. We are constructing railways and working mines in 'lnrkey as in former times we sought employment for capital in Mexico and the South American States; and, though it is to be trusted that the iniestments will be moae profitable in the present case, yet the remembrance of our losses in the Far West, and our resignation in bearing them, should convince foreign critics how litt le the formation of joint-stock companies has to do with an aggressive policy, or, indeed, with any policy at all. The Turks have a fine territory and no money, energy, or skill; we have all three, and they pour into Turkey as naturally as water finds its level. However, we are far from saying that this great extension of individual enterprise will not have political results. It is one of the benefits of freedom, and of the energy and self-dependence which it gives to the individual, that any private man may influence the destinies of this country. Our capitalists, our schemers, our travellers, are not directed according to any plan of British policy, but, on the contrary, the Government merely follows the routes they indicate and supports the enterprises they have initiated. The nation does not so much found colonies as merely accept the region in which a band of emigrants has settled as a colony, and send it a Governor and Staff. Even India was, in the beginning, conquered almost by private enterprise. At the
present day a private gentleman settles in Borneo, and obtains an ascendancy over a race of savages. His achievements come to the knowledge of his countrymen, and soon the region is brought under British sovereignty, aud a set of adventurers are pushing up the country, exploring and surveying in all directions. A devoted svissionary traverses the African continent, finds' fruitful tracts where it was believed aU was barrenness, discovers new races, new mountains, new rivers, and comes back to teU us of the prize. It. is not impossible that these men will prove to have been the founders of valuable British dependencies. But no one can say that the country had any design on Borneo or Cehtral Africa. So in the case of Turkey. The British Government has no plan for the establishment:of its ififluence ; it metely leaves tbings alone; and jet, hough the empire-will always, we trust, maintain its political independence, there can be uo doubt that the relations with England must in the coire of a few years become mQre iutimate1
and the effacts of English.enterj,rixe most remarkable. This country will be the best customer for the agricultural producs of the empire, and wil furnish it with the maost effectual means of transport. The intercourse between England and her Indian and Australian empires,which is now increas-
ing in a ratio wlhich distances all anticipation, must,' as far as passenger traffic is concerned, be carried on through the SuT"s dominions. The telegraph will be laid down through the heart of Asia within the next two years. The first railways in Asia ::Minor and Syria are to be almost immediately conmnenced; that connecting the Mediterranean and the Red Sea will soon be completed. We cannot therefore but exDect great material progress in these long-neglected regions, snd such an extension of our influence as wiU enable us to effectually uphold the integrity of the empire.
The writer of the letter we are considering, after deploring the advantages gained by British speculators, intimates that the French Government is desirous to counterbalance the power of England in the Indian Ocean, and purposes to form settlements on the Eastern Coast of Africa and in the Persian Gulf. We do not think the writer's speculations concerning the best means ,of overthrowing British power in the East need any criticiem from us. We had enough of that kind of thing in the time of the Prince DP JouiviLLn. The spirit of the document is indicated by the proposal to take a port at the Straits of Bab-elMaudeb, so that " nothing cau pass without our "permission." "We may have the Gibralbar of "the East, and we can, when we p1ease, obstruct
"the commuDications of England and her Indian " colonies." But the facts stated, supposing them to have any foundation, deserve a word of comment. The notion of France establishing herself at Bunder Abbas, or M.ohamerali, on the Persian Gulf, is of course out of the question. The first place is actually in possession of the British, and has been our chief naval station in those seas for many years. The other has possibly by this time received a visit from the British steamers, and would be the basis of operations in any advance into the country. Indeed, we think that this country would harcly consent to these spots being given up by our own authorities merely to be handed over to another European Power. If we are to respect the integrity of Persia, other nations mnust respect it too, and we think that our evacuation of the country ought to be coupled with an understanding that no part of it is to be ceded to any foreign State. Buw with respect to any spot in Easterm Africa which France chooses to occupy the case is different. We have seen not only without envy, but with satisfaction, the attempts of several Governments to colonize remote islands, and cen only regret that the failure has been more frequent than success. Any point beyond the limits of the Turkish Empire is free to them as to us, and many a degree of latitude lies open to their enterprise. But we cannot anticipate much from these Governmental schemes. A colony without colonists, or a naval station without maritime interests to protect, is a mere sickly plant, without strength or vitality. The letter talks of establishing a French Singapore; but a Singapore can only spring from the commerce of an India or a China. The French may take Cape Guardafui if they choose, but we cannot comprehend what they are to do there. Our own plan is the best. Our people go forth to till and build, to subdue the wilderness and its barbarous inhabitants, and then the mother country accepts what has been done. This is the way the British Empire has been created, and by suchl individual energy alone can a nation become permanenzfly great in its own possessions and its influence over other empires.
It is difficult to criticize very accurately at pre-
It is difficult to criticize very accurately at present Sir JOE1N PAKrr'GTON'S new educational scheme, because neither its proposer nor any of lhis friends seem to know exactly themselves what it is; at least, if they do know, they have not the art of expressing tbemselves clearly. We are told that a great compromise has taken place between the religious and the secular party-to use the conuron terms,-and that these two parties have hit on an arrangement upon which they will support a common educational rate. Now, in the first place, it is not clear what right a certain number of gentlemenwhomeet totalktogether in aroomhave to say that they represent these two particq, and tlhat whatever they agree on the two parties will agree on. But let that pass. What is the comipromise ? We are told it is this,-tbat the religious party consents to a rate for schools in 'which there is only secular education; while the secular party consents to a rate for schools in which there is religious education, provided tllat no part of the mroney goes for the teaching of doctrinal religion. Now, take this compromise up to the proviso, and it is a consistent and intelligible one, but this tail to it greatly interferes with its rotundity, and makes it very difficult to say what the compromise is. Schools in which doctrinal religion is taught are to have their share of the rate, but the rate is not to go to the teaching of doctrinal relig.on. But what is the difference? The school receives the money, and therefore that money contributes to the teaching of whatever is taught in the school, whether secular knowledge, or religion in general, or doctrinal religion. Sir JoHN PAxINGTOT draws the distinction that "it is not directly applied" to this object, but Lord JOuN RussELL very properly observes that this is not a relevant distinction.
This compromise, then, is a very unintelligible affair. As for the scheme itself-so far as it is explained-it promises to elicit all the opposition which last year's scheme did, and some other besides. It is not universal or compulsory, indeed, but local and permissive. But that is so slender a disguise for the thin edge of the wedge that it cannot be expected to conciliate many. Lord ROBEBT CECIL pointed out that even Sir JOIN PAKMGTON'S own precedent betrayed him. Sir JonN referred to the County Police Act of some Years bac'-h as an example of a permissive Act, but, unfortunately, it happens that this Act was only last session converted into a compulsory one. The religious difficulty has not yet been surmounted, at least if we may judge fcom the remarks of Mr. HPNr.EY, who prot2sts most strongly against the scheme, as an interference with religious freedom, inasmuch as it compels the schools of one denomination to receive scholars of another, and not to teach them religion; and, lastly, Lord Josii RUssELL himself speaks ominously," I don't quite understand whether or not he pro" poses to assist by a rare a school in which the "secular principle is followed, and no religious "instruction is given. Such a provision, if it "formed part o!ithe measure, might create con5 siderable difficulties. It has had no place in any "scheme which either the right hon. gentleman or sc I have ventured to propose to the House."
The compromise, then, between the religious and the secular party, whomever else it includes, evidently does not include Lord Jomis RU5sEsL. This does not tell Well for it at starting; it is not a good commencement; so true is it that a comproruise generally gais one man by. losiig another. The Mandheqter arrangenent, indeed, just throws out Lord Joih BU8Sn.O Lord Joji isIfor comprehensive religious education, and is therefore just not taken in by a bargain between the Denoniinationalist oa the one aide and the Seou-
larist on the other. The two recoitWle1 Their |dif'er noes, if they do reconcgo them, at his expense, and therefore, howeve2e they may be pleased with their bargain, he cannot be expected to come in. He therefore shows igns of recalcitration. HoW Sir JOMN PAXWGTone's scheme wil1 fare under such a crowfira it is not difficult to predict; a plan whicir unites Lord Jonf Russss.; and Mr. HPsN
against it stands a poor chance. Sir Jo}r must institute 'another and a larger eompromise; but a compromise which takes in Lor4 JoHn will, perhaps, throw out the Manchester Dexiominationalists; and so the work of bargainin'will go on. Squeezo the bladder at one end, annd it bulges out at the other; then giva tl.e narrow end its fill, and it contracts at ther bioad. You cannot get it full at both ends. WVe have no doubt that Sir JoN has done the best he could, considering the material he had to deal with; but he must Eoon discover how impossible it is to bring all the complicated and conflicting material of which the religious thought in this country is composed into one harmonious plan. There are so many differences, andL each' Party thinks so much of its own. The Secularist is the most manageable, but even he has his peculiar protest, as this very compromise shows, from which he~ will not recede. The Denominationalist can just; -at least, one here and there-be got to agree to the admission of the Secularist into the bargain, but even the liberal Denominationalist cannot bear the'comprellensively religious plan which is Lore
JoxNs. ' Better have no religion taught in the school, is his maxim, than a bad one-an omnium gatherum religion. Dr. HooX went s" far some years ago as to write a pamphlet in favour of the separatist scheme, but he would probablyabhor the comprehensive one. How are you to satisfy aU these claimants ? Experience is the best teacher of trutb, and we may safely leave Sir JOHN PA=Toox to the slow but inevitable discovery which he has yet to make by this process. The comprehensive system happens to be a particular crotchet of Lord Jouxs, -who belongs on that point to the school of Dr. AtNOL=, and it is rather hard in Sir JOHN PARMITO just selecting his friend of last session for the person whose toes are to be trodden upon, a process which Lord Jonr likes as little as anybody.
We are to have, then, the Education Debate of last session repeated, with a slight variation, just to illutstrate the old maxim, that no one thing is exactly like another. No two minds and no two faces were ever quite alike; no two peas and no two drops of water were ever quite alike. Nature loves variety, and therefore we shall have an Education Debate this time not quite the same as the last one. But for this promise of freshness, however slight, we are indebted rather to the laws of nature than to Sir JoHN PAXINOTON.

Sir,-With reference to the report from Hudson's Bay, relative to Sir John Franklin's party, I beg to sby that the communication which Captain Osborn has made pabhc is no anonymous one, and that the extraordinary tone adopted by Mr. W. G. Smith, in torturing a simple piece of intelligence into a " charge" against the Hudson's Bay Company, inust satisy every one that a judicious discretion has beert exercised in not giving the name of any writer whose interests could and would be made to suffer by the company.
The report is simply there-statement of one which reacbed myself last autumn from Hudson's Bay, and so notorious was it that the only wonder is the Governor of the territory was ignorant of it and of others of the same nature.

Mlessrs. White, of West Co wes, the constructors of the lifeboat MaryWhite, have been employed to build the vessel, which is to be decorated in theOrientaistyle. It may beremembered thatthe Cardia, some weeks since, when homeward bound with the tndian malls and passengers, encountered a storm in the Mediterranean soon after leaving Malta, and her machinery having given way she was complea to put into Tunis Bay_ On that occasion His Highness the Bey not only sent out steamers to the assistance of the Caudia, but forwarded the mails and passengers to Marseilles by one of his steamer3, declining to receive any remuneration for the service.

They afterwards visited theWest London Union, near Smithfield, ad, upon inquiring for the casual ward, were informed that. this estblishment was at Battle-bridge, a distance of tweo miles and a-half off. They immediately repaired thither, and found the bailding to consist of a large stable, containing 14 horse-stalls, the only provision for the lodging of the casual poor, some few men being huddled together round at fire. The place was totally destitute of eitber straw or bedding of any description whatever. The poor creatures, in answer to inquiries made of them, stated that upon entering the building a smal portion of bread had been given them, but that it was the custom fo turn them out in the morning without anything to eat unless they first broke a ceitainx quantity of stones, of which there was a large heap in the yard. The Lord Mayor and bis friends next entered an adoining cattle-shed, where they found two destitute womea addled togetherinarug, ngon the bare ground, almost peished with cold, and without either fire or food.

(he following appeared in our second edition of yee. Iecday I
PARIS, WnDS.ESDAY, FxB. 18, 6 P.m.
The following letter, of recent date, from Constantinople, may be found interesting. It contains extracts from a memorandum or report addressed to the French Govemnment by a person who has an intimate personal knowledge of the places he describes, and who, for aught I know, may have been elployed there on a special mission. The letter in question is from a French source, which will sufi-
iently account for the manner m vwhich the writer speaks of the important part France is called on to play in the East:
"CONSTANTINOPLE, Fan. 9.
"Nothing but complaints against Lord Stratford among the diplomatic corps I His Impatient temper, his arrogant tone, and his constant interference with the internal affairs of Turkey; the ascendancy he has acquired in the counacils of the empire, and which he abuses to such a degree as to impose on the Snltan the choice of his Highness's Ministers-aU these things aggravate the illwiU against him. The late war, we hear it said on all sides, was undertaken with the object of relieving Turkey from the absorbing pressure of Russia. The object was attained; but has Turkey, though deivered from the Muscovito Yoke, there. fore recovered her independence and her liberty of action ? HEs she not rather changed her protector and her tyrant ? The positlon which Prince hfenschikoff aimed at occupying in Constantinople, is it not the same now held by Lord Stratford? Yes, it is indeed Lord Stratford who reigns and governs on the shores of the Bosphorus. It is through his influence that England has beon enabled to turn to her own profit the advantages acquired for Turkey by her admission into the European family, which was meant to bo for the advantage of all. We have only to look at what passes in the States of the Sultan and in the Black Sea to be convinced of the fact. For many months back England hai acted in that sea absolutely as if her intention were to esta blish herself there permanently, or at least to take possession of it at a future period. All the bays, aU the ports, every corner and nook, have been visited and minutely iuspected. The British flag has appeared in evory part successively of the coasts of Asia Minor and Turkey in Europe, on the seaboard of Russia, and in the mouths of the Danube, and wherever it floats England seems as if she, and she alone, were mistress.
"In the meantime Constantinople has undergone an invasion of another kind. A crowd of English agent3 has floecked hither, ardent and indefatigable in their demands for concessions. Turkey has been covered by them with Industrial and commercial establishments, which place her in complete dependence on Great Britain. The Turks are accustomed to see English ships of war everywhere, English shipbuilders and engineers, English capitalists and traders. Whether from weakness or calculation, the Turkish Government itself encourages this invasion of its territory, this absorption of its material resources. From this to com. plete submission there is but a step. Such is the language one hears in this city among the diplomatic corps, and such arz the complaints frequently uttered. I have reason to believe that they have formed the subject of a colective note addressed to certain Cabinets, and that they are the real eause of the departure for Paris of the First Secretary of the French Embassy. M. Thouvenel has, it is Said, demanded fresh instructions from his Government. God forbid that I should undertake the defence of Lord Stratford, or that I should attempt to justify his irascible character and his more than haughty manners, which suit rather the Minister of some Eastern despot than the repro. *zentative of a great nation like England. But, after all, are we really justified in reproaching him with his exertions to forward the interests of his country? If those exertions affect other parties, they are all the more bound to redouble their efforts to establish their influence also. Nothing can be more just. But, to speak frankly, Franca has taken no part in the great enterprises which are destined to completely change the face of Turkey, and from which she may obtain immense advantages. Who is in fault ? Is it not to the apathy of her children that she owes it rather than to the intrigues of Lord Stratford ? The French in general are distinguished by a certain Promptitude of mind and a power of initiation, but eeeu. tion is not their strong point; in this they do not shineThey do not possess the spirit of association nor the boldcess nor spoculative genius of the English. They who are Lo brave, so briliant in the field of battle, and who seem to derive fresh energy from the atdour of combat, are soon discouraged by the obstacles inherent in every great enterprise, and they no longer know how to advance. It is amusing to hear the French talk about these things. Ac. cording to them, their failures are attributable to foreign intrigues, and also to the want of support from their own Government. The French Government is invariably made responsible for every misfortune that ocours, and, according to them, they aro never sufficiently pro. tected. The Government does nothing to supporb them against foreign competition, nothing to open new mar s to their trade; in a word, nothing of what it ought to do. The Freitch are, it appears, like the Pope, infallible by their nature; every one is blamed for their failures except thentselves, who, in fairness, ought to bear exclusively the blame. As for me, who have been an eye. witness of these things, I can assure you that the French Government is far from meriting these commonplace accuFations. On the contrary, it employs aU its efforts to give the greatest possible development to its marine and its commerce, to extend its relations and its influence at every point of the globe; and nothing that can contribute to thesa escapes it-s attention. You have, heard, for instance, of the French frigate the Sibylle going to Muscat and the Persian Gulf. The SibyUe has orders to explore the whole of that gulf, and after leaving she will proceed, it is said, t) the Red Sea. It appears that the Emperor intends to ob. tain from the Shah of Persia the concession of diver, points on the coasts of that Soveren's states, and that negotiations have been already opened on that subject with the Persian Ambassador. These points are Bonder Abba; and Mobammerah. Abbas, which is admirably situate for connecting commercial operations with the Isle of Bourbon, is under the domination of the Imauin of Muscat. The Shah lets it to him at a yearly rent; it wiU therefore be easy for the French Government to take his place on the same conditions.
" As to Mohamnmerah, it is in a position possessing im. portance of a far different kind. Lying at the entrance of the Karan, which is navigable as far as Shuster, one of the most flourishing spots of the empire, the little town of Mohammerah has drawn to itself aU the advantages which Bussorah formerly enjoyed, and that to which it owes those advantages is the application, unique in those countries, of free trade. What would it not hecome if it were in the hands of a great European natior.? It would be one of the mnostactive and richest entrepots of the East, a new Ormuz, which would soon supplant Bagdad and Bussorah. It is not withoat reason that the French Government has turned its attention to that quarter. Its attention was principaUy attractea by a memorandum, or report, addrensed to it by a person who has traversed and profoundly studied Africa,and in which are indicated the points which it will be most useful to take and to occupy. Here is an extract:-
"'The bay from Diego Suarez to Madagascar, a port near Jubb, Cape Guardafui, the entrance to the Straits of Babelnandeb, and a creek in the Red Sea near Massouah, in Abyssinia-such are the points which appear to me suitable to form the chain of our colonies in the western part of the Indian Ocean. The taking possession of them would not be attended with any great difficulty on the part of the natives. It would admirably promote the plan of connecting our colony of Bourbon witlh the isthmus of Suez by a line of steamers. The points indicated would furnish coal, iron, timber for shipbuilding, and provisions in abundance ; and they are, moreover, situate in a healthy climate. The Bay of Diego Suarez, independently of thae advantages it offers to the extension of the French navy, would secure our line of defence. If we consider the situation of the Isle of Bourbon. it will be seen how exposed is that colony in its isolation. Bourbon, which is so distint from our possessions in India, wllich are so trifling in them-
,elves, is eveywvhere surrounded by the English possessions:-Mauritins, the Cape, MahU, the Seychelles, and Port Natal. Bourbon is alone and distant in the midst of these seas, wvhich are under Indo-Britan. nic domination. It has not even a port to shelter our ships, which go to Port Louis for repairs in sight of the British flag. The treat:es of 1814 have reduced us to this humiliating necessity. It is urgenit to remedy this state Of things, and, in the meantime, to insure to our colony resourcea ta make it respected, and at the same time to our marine a harbour of refuge, in which it may repair its damiagae under the protection of. French batteries. The occupation of the Bay of Diego Saarez would at once realize those conditions. But this would not be the only one ; for that bay would become the sntrepot of the trade of Western Africa: it would be the point for our ships to touxch at and take in provisions, and whither would come the Portuguese and Datch shps as well as the American whalers. Another Singapore would arise in those places, which would be the centre of a colony, the development of which would be facilitated by the divisions in the island, and tho impatience. of the Saclavas nder the Ho domination. The fertility of the 3Mahga.sh territory, the *xuberait vegetation of the soil, which produces al the tropical plants, the low price Of
manual labour, and the character of the inhabitants, woul 1 triumph over all difiiculties which the colonial system encounteru eloewvhere. If an objection be founded on our un5uccessful attempts on the shores of Madagascar, it disappears when we take into consideration the nature of the place. It was, in fact, on the eastern side of the island; batween the BayofAntongil and Port Dauphin, thatFrance bad her frst establishments. Now, the unhcalithinee of these coasts contrasts with the climate of northern regions, to which all our naval medical men render the most satisfactory testimony.
" ' With regard to the point which I have indicated at the entrance of the Red Sea, its advantages are not les; evident. In point of fact, the Strait of Babelmandeb may be henceforth regarded as the principal port of the Indiaa Ocean. It is by that the trade of Europe must pass when it shall resumn the path of Suez. It is therefore of importance to maintain the freedom of that passage, and no' to allow the keys of it to fall into the hands of England Once posted at the mouth of the Arabian Gulf, nothing can pass without our permission. We may have the Gibraltar of the East, and we can, when we please, obstruct the eommunications of England with her Indian colonies.
'I I As an entrepot the establishment now proposed would attract to it the trade of Choa, of the Adels, and of the Gallas, which would.descend by the lawash into the lake of Houssa, and would then be little more than 72 leagues from the sea.
"'The investigations carried on in Abyssinia and all the information fnrnished by the natives demonstrate that the countries which approach the most southern aources of the Nile, even to the Indian Sea, are extremely rich in tropical products of every kind. There, at the foot of the Mountains of the Moon, known, though imperfectly, for a long time, is the real country of the plant which gives uscoffee. It is there of a larger size and a finer growth, ani its product is superior to that of Yemen, which is so famous. There, also, is produced the plant known as the Rat, or Tchat, of which the leaves afford a tea which may one day surpass that of China. Rice, indigo, cotton, gums, spices, ivory, and dyewoods abound, and supply materials for easy and lucrative exportation, and aUl these products may be acquired at a price much inferior to what they cost in India.
" 'All these districts,the ports of Djedda, Mocha, and Hodeida, comprised inYemen, containmore than 20,000,000 consumers, with whom we should have to apprehend no other competition than that of the Arabs and the Banians. At the present moment that trade produces a circulation of more than 80,000,000f., of which the articles manufactured in Europe form the greatest part. Such a market would become extremely valuable after the opening of the isthmus of Suez.
"' It is then of the last importance to be beforehand with other nations, and to occupy positions which may enable us to maintain, with advantage and security, extensive commercial relations. These positions would be of extreme importance in the event of a war with England. They would furnish us with means of action more pressing against the Anglo-Indian empire.'
" You will perceive, then, from the foregoing extracts of the memorandum addressed to the French Government that it is doing its best to find out new openings for its trade, that it neglects nothing that may develope and extend its power, and to introduce Its influence into regions the most remote and the least visited in our days. If it does not succeed as it deserves it is becaus3 it is badly served by its people. The French are fond of home, they do not like to quit it, or to emigrate to a distance. Moreover, theyhavenotthespirit of enterprise, the genius for speculation and adventure-if I may use the word-which characterizes the British people, and which renders the latter so eminently suited for the establishment on their own soil as abroad, of the most colossalundertaldngs, The French have many fine qualities, but they have not that; and in the want of it lies the secret of their discomfiture at Constantinople."
A letter from the banks of the Danube announces that the fort of Sulina, placed at the mouth of that river, had been givenup on the 4th of February to the Ottoman Commissioner, Omar Bey, a captaip in the Turkish navy, sent for that purpose from Constantinople. The fort of Sulina is situate on the delta of the Danube. Omar Bey iB appointed naval commander of the district, newly-created, of which Sulina is the capital.
The European commission appointed to report on the practicability of navigating the Danube from Isaktcha to the Black Sea is pursuing its object with great activity. M. Becke, the Austrian delegate, has presented his report, approved by the comnission. It is, consequently, hoped that commerce in general will profit by the 15th article of the treaty of Paris, which declares the navigation of the Danube free to all nations.
The Government has received accounts from the frontiers of Asia, dated 25th January, which announce that the Russians had finished the construction of a new fort at the mouth of the Goorgan, a river which flows into the Caspian Sea on the coast of Mazanderan, belonging to Persia. This fortress is intended to check the Turcoman tribes, and contains a garrison of about 2,000 men. It is constructed on the plan of those already built on that coast at the point at which the caravans arrive from Ehiva. The number of troops employed in defending the various fortified points of that part of the Caspian Sea may be estimated at 12,000 men. Hlydrographic plans of that sea have been executed by order of the Admiralty at Astrakhan, and it is found to cover a tract of 17,000 square leagues. It is as deep as the Black Sea, and possesses the same advantages and the same difficulties. By the last accounts the Russian Government had given orders to assemble an army on the banks of the Araxes and the frontiers of Persia, composed of the 13th Division of Infantry,commanded by GeneralChruleff, and of the 18th Division of Infantry, commanded by General NVagner. These two divisions form part of the Army of Asia, placed under the Comnmander-in-Chief,Prince Bariatinsky, for the defence of the Caucasus and the Caspian Sea. General Prince Orbelian is appointed inspector of the Russian fortresses on the COast of that sea, and Admiral Wassilieff is appointed to the command of the Admiralty at Astrakhan. All these measures, although long since planned, have only lately been carried into execution. The late events in Persia have had great influence on these movements, but a more serious fact is, that a convention was signed on the 5th of January last between the Emperor of Russia and the Court of Teheran for the cession of the territory which extends along the frontiers of Turkish Armenia between Bayazid and Nakhtschivan. This convention is of great importance for Russian influence in that portion of Asia, and it is asserted that General Prince Bariatinsky has received orders to establish without delay military posts and a girdie of forts on the territory lately ceded. The Government accounts from the Persian Gulf to the 25th of December announce that the steam-frigates Chusan, Singapore, and Pottinger, belonging to the East India Company, had quitted the Bay of Bushire to anchor in the port of Karrak. The Admiral had commissioned the commanders of the Euphrates and the Tigris to make a survey of the island and port of Karrak. mTwo transports, arrived from Bombay, had brought the materials necessary for the construction of docks and storehouses. The port of Karrak is regarded as one of the finest in the world. 800 merchant vessels may be safely anchored there. The British Admiral despatched on the 21st of December the Goulanar and Elphinstone to the island of Ormuz, situate at the entrance of the Persian Gulf. A vast maritime position is about to be established there, and a dep6t for coal. It is said that he likewise intends to place himself in communication with Busorah by means of a service of steamboats on the Euphrates.
The Independance Belge states that the bases of the arrangement in progress between Feruk Khan and the Persian Government are the mutual restitution of Bushire and Herat, and the establishment of a free port at Karrak.
The last accounts state that the Russian authorities had quitted Bolgrad, and surrendered the town to the Commissioners sent from Jassy by the Moldavian Government.
M. Besson, Lieutenant-Colonel of the Staff and French Commissioner for fixing the boundary of the Principalities, charged with tracing the Upper Yalpuck, has written that his labours were so advanced that Konmrat might be handed over to the Russian authorities on the 15th February.
It is annoumced that a commission is about to be appointed to choose a position to which to transfer the prisoners at Cayenne. Several places have been mentioned. One is New Caledoma and the other Algeria. Another idea suggested is to take possession of the Zephyrine Islands, opposite the coast of Africa, and which have the advantage of being detached from the continent or coast of Algeria.

A person who had left Madrid 12or18 months a"o during the palmy days of the Progresistas, and who returned to it now, would be struckkabove Rl thmnvs by the scarcity of uniforms. The National Guar, which loved to show itself in martial attire, has entirely disappeared, and one sees in its stead a Gendarmerie in cocked hats and blue coats with crimson facings, a few scarlet coated cavalrymen, and the ugly undersized infantry of the line, some of whose battalions have adopted an extremely sensible brown great coat, plaited at the waist, and affording much warmth and protection from the weather, as well as a hideous shako of whity-brown felt, high in front and lowbehind. Thechanges inthe uniformof the Spanish army are continual, and are doubtless profitable to certain Generals, although many of them tend little to the improvement of the soldier's appearance. As re-. gards other recent changes in Madrid, there is a good deal of knocking down and building up again in some parts of the town; the works in the Paerta del SoI progress but slowly; gigantic pipes are being laid down for the abundant supply of water, with which this capital is at last to be blessed. It is an old saying that all the water which enters Madrid is drunk; and when we consider the small quantities in which that element has hitherto reached it, and the eternal thirst withwhich all Spaniards seem afflicted, one Cannot but believe that very little remains for purposes- of ablution. Judging from the extreme scarcity of baths in Madrid, and from the minute dimensions and small number of the washing utensils with which hotels and lodging-housEs of even the best class are here provided, the belief is forced upon one that the Spaniard holds the cooling of his inner man to be far more important than the purification of his exterior. One hears of Mussulmins in the desert performing their ablutions with sand, and certainly where water is not .washing becomes difficult; but now that a crystal abundance is to come full gush into the very streets of Madrid, we may venture to hope I that an improvement wiU take place in the usages of
the population, and that not only wiU baths be obtainable at other seasons than summer, but that something may probably be done in the way of such establishments for the poorer classes; that streets may be watered, and that linen may be washed otherwise than by pounding it between a cudgel and a stone in the shallow and frequently dry bed of the Manzanares. At the present time, however, the Madrilenos are less occupied in congratulating themselves on the prospect of a flood which ought to be as welcometo them as ever was inundatloninarid Egypt or thunder shower in the parched tropics, than in considering how they shall obtain and pay for their daily bread and beans. Everything here is at famine prices. Owing to the badness of its environs, the badneis of the roads and difficulty of communication, and the distance of the provinces whence it draws its chief supplies, Madrid is always a dear place; but now bread is 150 per cent. dearer than in ordinary times, and meat, fish, vegetables, and nearly every article of food, are at double their usual prices. Rents have of course risen in proportion, and the expense of living in a very indifferent way is as great as that of a luxurious existence in a, first-rate London or Paris hotel. The poor, of course, suffer greatly, notwithstanding the facilities afforded them by the authorities for procuring bread at a more reasonable rate. Beggars swarm in the streets, follow you into shops and houses, and lie whining and imploring on the stairs of the Post-office and other public buildings. There is unquestionably a great deal of misery in Madrid at present, which does not, however, prevent a great deal of gaiety and amusemens. Balls and parties are numerous, and the Italian Opera, which is very good this year, is assiduously attended. The prima donna, La Penco, a fine singer, who excites enthusiasm here, is said to be engaged in London for 1858. As regards politics, few persons trouble themselves about them. In Spain they are certainly an ungrateful subject of consideration. The prospects of the elections seem to excite but a slight interest. The press is kept tight in hand, and can say little or nothing; and much less transpires of what goes on in Ministerial councils and administrative departments than in the time of the poor Progresistas, who, in the simplicity of their hearts, did their work almost in the open street. Besides financial difficulties, that eternal topic here, the division in the Cabinet, is perhaps the most prominent question. Although in public Narvaez and Nocedal appear on the most cordial terms, it is well known there is little love between them, and that they pull different ways. Narvaez is no longer the man he was. His fortune is made, years have come upon him his energy has diminished, and he has not the same incentives to exertion as formerly. Time was when the very breath of his nostrils would have swept away a presumptuous young lawyer of M. Nocedal's stamp, and have scattered afar the opposition that now hampers and restrains him. He now temporizes, and at times even totters. M. Nocedal, once a warm Progresista (as he was occasionally stingmgly reminded in the last Cortes by Senor Olozaga and others), is now an Absolutist. He is confident, unscrupulous, and clever; a very fine orator, difficult to daunt ; a troublesome hornet in opposition, but without sufficient ballast to sustain himself long as Prime Minister, even if he succeeded in attaining that elevation, at which he apparently aims. He is supported by General Lersundi, who, for a short time was chief of a very corrupt Ministry, which preceded that of Sartorius; Barzanallana, the Minister of Finance, is also said to share his views. He also enjoys the countenance and aid of the King and his camarilla. At the head of the King's military household is General Urbistondo, an ex-Carlist, who kept the ring during the fight in Madrid laslt July, patrolling round the town with the .mavalry, while SeTrano and his friends within disposed of the unlucky Nationals, disorganized and cowed by want of a leader.. The Queen, engrossed by h-r pleasures and devotions, between which, after the fashion of her family, she divides her time, maintains for the moment an uncertain attitude,sustained by counteracting influences in a sort of centrd.
position between contending parties. It is evideat she does not think fit to adhere to the Absolutist:
for, if she did, Narvaez would cluickly be upset. We have had abundant proofs of the ease and rapidity with which she gets rid of a Minister who h ;s ceased to be pleasing to her. Narvaez, on his par, aware of the delicate ground he stands upon, does his best to strengthen his position, and hence
ma anuxety to replace Barzanaiana by Senor Mon who is identified with a Constitutional Goverament-constitutional, however, with many restrictions, and more in name than iln fact. it is still doubtful whether the change will be effected. There are daily rumours of a Ministerial crisis, or at least of a modification of the Cabinet in favour of the Constitutional party. The representations of iVlaria Christina are said to have made a great imprei-
sion on the Queen, who, after the receipt of 'be last letter from her mother, is reported to have sent for Narvaez, to have shown it to him, and to have declared her intention of following the advice it contained. Nocedal, finding the tide turning against him, is said to have su -
pended his Absolutist manceuvres, aud to have ceased his attempts to influence the e'ections in that aense.
In Spain changes are so rapid and sudden that one, needs to photograph the situation, lest the next moment it should dissolve into another view. Bus the above is at present the aspect of affairs.
The Three per Cents. were done at 38 65.

The English funds opned this moning at the.
firm prices of yesterday, but, Owing to a temporary increase In the demand for money there Was subs>quently a reaction of an eighth. Gonsols for money.
v ere first quoted 93t to ; and they left off at 93k, to i for money and 93 to 99 for the 5th of March. The rate for loans on Goverumnent securities was from 6 to 6i per cent., and in the discount_marke6 and at the Bank there was a full demand at 6 per cent. In the Stock-Exchange the tranactions of the dav were unnimportant. Bank Stock closed at 218 to 220; Reduced, 931 to 94; New Three per Cents., 94i to J; India Stock, 219 to 221; Exchequer-bonds, 98« to {; India Bonds, 2s. dis. to s.L pm.- and Exchequer-bills, par to 3s. pm.
The Bank are making their usual quarterly ad, vauces to the April dividends, on bills of exchanga not having more than six months to run, and on other approved securities at 6 pr cent. per annum.
Foreign securities were wellsuported, but the transactions were not of magnitufde. In Turkish Six per Cents. for money business took place at 95i; for the account, 95k, i, and J. The Four. pr Cents. Guaranteed were purchased at 101k. Tbe general operations comprised-Brazilian, for account, 103 and 1024; Chilian Six per Cent., 104i; Mexican, for account, 22i and k; Rupa Four-and-a-Elalf per Cents., 97 and 97A; Sardin

The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 69f. 30c. for money, and 69f. 60c. for the end of the month, showing in the latter case a further rise of a quarter per cent.
The letters from the continent state that the exchanges.continue with a favourable appearance for this country. At Paris money for commercial purposes has become comparatively abundant, and the best descriptions of bills are eagerly sought at rates below those of the Bank of France. With regard to the Russian railway concession, it is an important circumstance that the caution money of 600,0001. for the first set of lines must be deposited either in silver or Russiau stock during the present month. According to the contract the sum which represents the French subscriptions may be deposited in French Rentes.
The Board of Trade returns for the past year were issued this morning. They show the declared value of the exports of the produce of the United Kingdom to have been 115,890,8571., or 20,202,7721. in excess of those of 1855, With the single exception of wool, which was retained as zmuch as possible to supply the wants of our own manufacturers, every article is largely on the favourable side. Cotton manufactures stil constitute by far our most important branch of export, but metals have greatly increased, and now present an extraordinary total. Woollen and linen manufactures stand next in order, and both show a large augmentation. Silk manufacturers have likewise increased, but an allowance must be made in this case, as well as in that of cotton, for the advance in the value of the staple. Among the items that depend in an important degree on the colonial trade haberdashery, hardwares, and leather figure for h steady improvement. Subjoined is a table showing the exact increase or decrease under each head:-
With regard to imported commodities, the quantity of breadstuffs taken is a prominent feature. Of other articles of food and luxury the consumption appears to have been moderate, considered in relation to the circumstances of the country. Cocoa, coffee, sugar, and tea present a dlight diminution. Spirits, wine, tobacco, and spices exhibit an increases:-
Subjoined are the quantities of provisions, J.c., imported and taken for home 'consumption:-
Of most other articles of raw, material or foreign manlfacture the imports have also been large. hi dyes and dyeing stufls there has been an increase in every description, except cochineal and cutch. Il etals show a general angmentation. The same has been the case with glas. manufactures and leather mannufacture. Guano, on the other hand, shows a decline from 305,061 tons to 191,501, and oils likewvise present a decrease in all sorts, except train. As regards seeds there have been heavy arrivals of linseed and rape. Of timber the supplies, both of Biitish and foreign, have been extremely great, and the consumption has been proportionably active.
The West India steamerMagdalena was announced to-day, with 177,0001. in specie.
At a meeting of the Eastern Steam Navigation Company, held to-day, Mr. Hope presiding, the report and accomnts 'were adopted. With respect to the progress of the vessel it was stated that it is expeeted to be so far completed as to allow of its being launched in August, hen a trial tri is contemplated. A lengthened discussion took p aee regarding the diffileulties encoontered ana the efforts made to meet them. S3everal shareholderseomplainedof the long arrears of calls, and desired information conocerning the amount likely to b.ultimatelyreeoverod. It wasexplained that of the 192,0001. about 64,0001. is considered good, and that legEl proceedings wrill be
resorted to for obtaining payment. Included in the arrears are the calls due from Mr. Scott Russell,
%eb late contractor, who held a considerable number, of shares, while other parties have also become insolvent and unable to meet their engagements. The directors will take measures for forfeiting shares, but ti adopting this course will not abandon their right to sue for the payment of caUs. Duiring the debate a misapprehension arose with regard to the amount which will be required to complete the vessel, Mr. Brunel, the engineer, stating that 100,0001. will be an approximate estimate, which the resources of the company can supply. One of the ratiring directors differed from this opinion, and asserted that 60,0001. or 70,0001. further capital will be required to put the vessel to sea in condition. As Mr, Brunel had left the meeting, it was suggested tbat he ineant to imply that the original nominal capital would be sufficient. After some further conversation the directors were empowered to forfeit shares, and the interest warrants, as customary, are to be issued to the shareholders who have paid their calls.
The precise amount of specie wbich will be taken out to-morrow by the Peninsular and Oriental steamer Colombo is 677,1151., of which 670,3401. is silver for Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras, and 6,775g. gold for Ceylon and-Madras.
At the Court of Bankruptcy to-day the hearing of the .a%e of the Royal British Bank was adjourned for two months, the accounts not being ready.

"The market during the last four months,"1 remark Messrs. Dipnall, Phare, and Co., "has been generally inactive, and, although at one time some little movement seemed apparent, it resulted but in a limited business at the rates of the October sale, the market relapsing into its previous dull state, holders, however, showin firmness, and mostly anticipating an advance of 3d. to 4d. pz pound on the sale this day ended. The large quantity of indigo remaining uncleared u to the pr t of the October sale' evidently showed that thettrade, at least on the continent, were in pretty good stock, and less likely to want much for somne time, and therefore the mere able to resist any attempt to establish a higher range of prices than current at the laLst sale, at the same time, the excessive and unnecessary quanl. tity advertised also offered an additional reason for caution on the p art of buyer. Under these circumstances the sale o?ened bythe im orters offering their indigo more freely t an was expecte , and the hare rates of the latter half of the October sale were realized. This course of action was subsequently followed by most holders with more or less of reserve, it being noticeable that the late imports, in consequence of their having been more generally examined sold for moremoney than the indigo from previoussales, of whih the larger proportion of the sale consisted. The currency for Bengal and Oude may now be quoted at aboyt the average of the October sale, very desirable marks of new goods sometimes realizing a slight improvement, the sale closing with a little more spirit for Bengal than existed at the commence. muent. The almost entire Absence of orders for Russia has contributed in no small degree to prevent an advance, particularly in good and fine qualities, whieh have 1erhaps sold relatively the cheapest. In Madras the dry
le6f kinds, which were in abundant supply, have gone at a decline of 2d. to 3d. per pound for gcod ordinary and middling qualities, but the descriptions below 2s. Od. hardly show a discount at all, being in more demand and strongly supported; a large quantity was, however, either withdrawnt or bought In, the buyers bheinZndisposed to meet the views of holders, except to a limi extent, the intentions of the latter bcingto make the October sale's prices, while a concess b£2d . to 3d. per pound w-s expected by the trade at V'ch a large quantity migbt have been sold.
Ma4rs, gn the other hand, having been moderate in P hua tity, but mdierent in quaity, has mostly met a spirited competition at from October prices to 4d. advance. The Manilla was mqetly bought in, only a few of the preferable lots having been sold. Tke B catalogue, with goods in secohid-hands, as usual, met with no attention, and out of the 1,720 chests declared only 120 chests found buyers in the room. The quantity sold in the room is reported as 4, 971. cke3ts, iuo addition to which about o00 chests of the bougbt-in have been sold. Both home and export trade have bought but to amoderate extent. There has been a fair attendance of buyers from.tlso coumtry during the sale, but r. limited one from the continent.".

The LORD CtAuCLL0on, in delivering the judgment of tbe House, said tbat the question to be decided vas whether in the appellant's condescendanco there were any relevant grounds of action set forth against the respondents ? It was clear that the appellant's original ground of action vas founded upon the supposed liability of the respondents as members of a certain provisional committee. lHe evidently wished to make out that they were meimbers of that committee, and thought that if he succeeded in doing so they would he jointly and severally iable to him for the payment of his claim. It had been, however, decided that members of a provisional commattee were not liable as a body, but only for those things for which they had personally made themselves responsible. For these reasons it appeared to him (the Lord~Chancellor) that the appellant's condescendance was irrelevant, and that, therefore, the interlocutors pronounced in the court below were fonnded in perfect good sense and musti he affirmed, and the appeal dismissed, with costs.

(Before the LoRD CHQZANcEuol, Afr. JU5tiCe Wn.S,
and Mr. Justice CRowDER.)
This appeal from Vice-Chancellor Wood was placed in the paper for the common law judges-who had been called in by the Lord Chancellor to assist him in hearing the caseto deliver their opinions. The question, one of considerable importance, was whether the payment of interest by a tenant for life of real estate on a bond debt of his testator kept the debt alive, so as to enable the obligees of the bond to recover the debt out of the estate any time within 20 years after the last payment by the tenant for life. The testator (the obligor of the bond) died in 1827, the tenant for life in 1854, and the last payment of interest made by him was on the 29th of May, 1847. The Vice-Chancellor held that the tenant for life was not the person liable to pay such bond debt, andbad not, therefore, by payment of inter. est kept it alive against the inheritance. His Honour also held that under the 3d and 4th of William IV., c. 42 x. 5, the extension to creditors upon bond of the remedy to 20 years after an acknowledgment by writing, or part payment or part satisfaction, was as against the person making such acknowledgment only, and did not enable the creditor to sue upon the bond generally.
Mr. Justice WiLijAMS delivered the joint opinions of himself and Mr. Justice Crowder and, after stating that they agreed with the view of tie Vice-Chancellor, that the: case was not within the 40th section of the 3d and 4th of William IV., c. 2t, said a twofold question was raised under the statute of the 3d and 4th of William IV., c. 42-namely, whether the payment of interest by the tenant for life was a payment by " the party liable ;"' and, secondly, whether such payment was an acknowledgment operating against the estate generally, or only against the
arty making the payment. Upon the first point their frdships felt no difficulty, inasmuch as a bond creditor could recover jointly against the heir and the devisee of the obligor, and therefore the devisee tenant for life might be said to be as much " liable" as the real or personal representative of the obligor. Under the 3d section of chapter 42 the tenant for life would be entitled to plead the liminta tion therein mentioned, and consequently he was also authoried to make the payment or acknowledgment mentioned in the 5th section. As to the other point, 'whether the payment or acknowledgment operated only against the party mahng it, or had the effect of freeing the action generally, their Lordships were of opinion in favour of the latter view, and therefore thought that the appeal ought to be allowed.
In the case of "Fannin v. Anderson " (8, Q. B.) it was held I that if a right of action accrued against several persons, one of whom was beyond seas, the Statute of Limitations (4 Anne, c. 16, s. 19) did not run till his return, though the others hadnever been absent from the kngdom. Reuoning by analogy from the decision in that case, and from various other ones of a similar description, their Lordships came to
the conclusion that the operation of the atatute of the 3d I and 4th of William IV., c. 42, was suspended generally In
the present case, and therefore that there was no bar op-I posed to the claim of the bond creditor.
The Lon DCHAwcCoLLo. said, that the duty nol devolved upon him of finally disposing of the case, but5bfr dig EO, he should maturely weigh the certificate of the learned Judges, as the case was one of extreme imnportance. He would give his judgment during the present sittings.

WESTMACOTT V. IiOBMS.
This was an appieal from a decree of Vice-Chancellor idtetrsicy. The bill was filed by 1Mr. Robert Ma-rsh West. maotadMr. George 3Knox, of Abbey-house, Shrewsbury, and otated that in 1853 Mr. Westmacott agreed with the defendant Mr. John William Robins for the urchase from the latter of 495 acres of laud, near Muswell ar roose in the colony of New South Wales. InthspraeM.Wsmacott acted for and on behalf of the New South Wales Gold Company. Subsequently Mr. Knox became materially interested in tnme agreement. When the abstract of titleto the property was delivered it appeared that it commenced with a grant from the Crown, the ori ' al of which was not forthcoming. A COrresponr
ensued between the solicitors of the vendor and purchaser, and a further abstract was furnished, from which it appeared that the originl grant from the Crowvn contained a reservation of "al mines of gold, silver, and coal, and of full liberty to search for, dig, and carry away" the same, and other reservations. From reasons imbedded in, andpro. fessed to be disclosed by an active correspondence set out in the bill, the plaintiffs seem to have thought the course of insisting upon the purchase the preferable oncto be adopt
notwithstanding the absence of the original grant, and the factrshwnals the re eruvations before stated did exist. The bill was threutanitryd,mogter things, a declaration that the plaintiffs were entitled to compensation by way of deduction from the purchas
money in respect of the Crown rights nd reservations, the amnt to be settled by the decree of the Court, and ta the defendant might ba decreed specificallyto perform the arOment; or, in the alternative, that, if the Court should think the plaintiff not entitled to any deduction from the purchase money, specific perfo.rmance might be decreed without compensation, the plaintiff being willing and undertaking to complete the agreement on that footing rather that have the same abandoned. If the defendant should be held not bound to complete, then the return of the purchase money was p rayed; and also an injunctioni to restrainan other sale of the land was asked. The Vice-Chancellor decred the specific performance without compensation, and directed each side to pay its own costs. from this decision the plaintiffs appealed.
Mr. Lee and Mr. Fooks for the appellant; Mr. Malins and Mr. Terrell for the respondent.
Their LORDsmns made a decree for a specific performance, with a reference to see whether the vendor had msoe

Tho Vice-Chancellor on the hearing of the case in Jnly last directed an inquir whether the whole or any, and what part of the 5,000 dolars, was paid or applied for, the benefit or use of Messrs. Wood and Lovell in the purebase of palm oil, provisions,necessaryrepairs to the shipAmy, wages,or otherwise for thebenefit.ofMessrs.WoodandLovell. Thechief clerkeertafied that 4,558 doollrs, being rmoneys of the plaintiff, were applied to the benefit of Messrs. WGood and Lovell, and a motion to vary that certificate now came on with the causo for further consideration. Bishop had put in his answer, and had since died, and the chief clerne in the inquiries which took place before him had received Bishop' ansrr
as evidence against his co-defendants, Messrs. oodand LovelL.
Mr. Bacon apd Mr. Karslak-e appeared for Messrs. Wood andLovell in support of the motion to vary the chief elerk's certificate; Mr. Wigram and Mr. Archibald Smith for the plaintiff; and Mr. Turner for the personal representative of Bishop, who had died since the bill was filed.
The Vicz-CEsc=XL oR, after saying that accordin to the laws now in emistenoe relating to evidence, the chief clerk had very properly allowed the answer of Bishop to be read as against his co-defendants, and that the evidence in the case supported the chief clerk's finding, said, that the principal question was how far a contract entered into by a master of a ship without the authority of tho owners, but of which contract the owners had had the benefit, was one in respect of which they could be sued in this court. The evidenee here showed that the object of the voyage back to ths country, which was to brng over a cargo of palm oil, could not have been accomplished without the assistance of the plaintiff's money, and in that state of things he thought the plaintiff entitled to a decree in accordance with the chief clerk's finding, with costs.

ROOK Y. TALBOT.
Mr. WILLCOOK and Mr. HiSLOP CLAmRE moved, on behalf of the plaintiff, who is the holder of ton ordinary or unguaranteed shares in the South Wales Raiiway Company, to restrain the defendants, who are the directors of the company, from declaring or paying any dividend or nny interest or bonus on the ordinary or unguacanteed capital of the company until the works of the railway from the main Pembroke line to Pater, or otherwise Pembroke Docks, and also to Pennard Mouth, in 31lford Haven, and tU e rest of the Pembroke main line, shall be completed and open for public traffic, which works tb.e plaintiff alleged tba comiganywere bound to complete before they could lawfull
eclare a dividend within the provisions of their Acts. ft was stated that the defendants intended to de'a. - I e li
adividend onthe ordinary shares at a meetbng '. i foT the purpose, to bo held on Friday, the 2(ltb of I rv (this day).
Mr. .tOLT and Mr. OSBORITE, on hba'E f the detendants, opposed the application on the gr ad that the bill was deficient for want of le* ;ies, the - npany itself not being made defendant tihough, in tact, any dividend declared must We declared by the enonDany, and not by the in. dividual directors. This was cleea from the clauses of the Companies Clauses Consolidation Ae&t, 1845; also on the yC nd that the plaintiff qu shareholder could not be Js3n.- d by the declaration of a dividend, and that the compln, iaade by him could only be made in his character as one of the public, who were mainly interested in the completion of the works. After some discussion
'The VIcz-CE acLLon said that, although the directors must necessarily take an aetive part towards the declaration of dividends, still it was clear that no dividend could be declared without the company, and the bill was therefore in that respect at least deficient for want of parties. Still the restraining the declaration of a dividend for a week could not be productive of much damage, whereas if a dividend were declared the plaintiff might be irremediably daaaged in the lrosecution of his suit, which instead of being aimed, as it might now be, against the single neck of the company, would have to be directed against innumerable shareholders whose right to a dividend might have been declared. The questlon was one which ought to be properly discussed, and hie should therefore make an interign order, restraining the defendants tiU Thursday the 26th inst., with liberty tothe plaintiff to amend his biU, without prejudice to the notice of motion, he undertaking to abide-by such order as the Court might make s to damages.

CUOLLET V. IOPFMANx.
(Sttings at Nisi Priu, before Lord CAipBj and
SpeciaZ .Thuiit.l
Sir F. Thesiger, Mr. Bovill, Q.C, and Mr. Webster ap peared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Edwin James, Q.C., Mr.
indmarch, and fr. Manisty for the defendant.
The plaintiff in this action, Maximilian Louis Chollet, was a Frenchman carrying on business in Paris, and he sued the defendant, Roffinann, the agent of a house at Frankfort, to recover damages for the infringement of a patent !Rnted to Etienne Masson on the 12th of November, 1850.
e patent in question was for * improvements in the preparation of certain vegetable alimentay substances for the provisioning of shpp and anies, and other purposes where the said sabstances are required to be freserved." The
plaintiff sued as Masson's assignee. The defendant pleaded ' a numnber of pleas, the chief being osne denying the novelty. of the invention.
SirF. Tsrassr~ra, in opening the case to the jury said the action was brought to recover damages for the iniringement of a patent granted in Xovember, 1850, to a Frenchman named Mfasson. The defendant, Hoffmuann, wras an agent of a Frankfurt house, -who imported articles into this country, which professed to be made under another patent, granted five ieafs ater Masson's patent, but which were identical with those made under Macson's
patent. Thelearnedcounsel saiddhoefeltboundtocall the. attention of the jury to the mode in which the defendant had prepared for hiS defence. He was required by the Act of Parliament not only to plead his defences, bat also to give specific notice of the grounds of his objections - and as to Masson not being the truer and first inventor, te gave notice of two other patents and the names of 24 persons in trade who had sold such articles before Masson's patent. That had rendered it incumbent upon the plaintiff's attorney to go about in the trade to make inquiries, and the result of those inquiries the jury would hear. Only on Thursday last the defendant had obtained leave to amend his 'notice, which he did by striking out 20 of the 24 names, and adding eight others - and he also added three other patents to his previous fist. The object of the improvements now to be laid before the jury was that of preserving provisions and making them easy of transport. That was the general idea, and approximated to vlhat Masson had in. his mind, though the application of his invention was not so limited. Masson was gardener to the Central Horticultural Society In Paris, and he sold his patent to Chollet, the plaintiff. A patent was taken out in 1850, but it was not t' the beginning of the year 1851 that the plaintiff introdaced it into England. it was exhbited at the Great Exhibition of 185, and obtainedl the approbation of
the judges, who awarded a prize medal, considering it to be an invention of great novelty and utility. At fist the trade slighted it and ridiculed it;, but its maerits at lentih became so ap rent that it was now inx tho greatet use not only by the Clvernment of this country, but also by many foreign Governments. It was adopted in the navy and in emigration vessels, and to such an extent was it used in the campaign in the Crimea that no fewer than 800,000,000 rationsofthe preserved vegetables were sent out and consumed there. The method in which Masson treated suoclent vegetables was this --He caused them to be desiccated by exposure to heated air, and then placed them on wicker shelves, where they were dried; and then, by means of hydraulio pressure, h redauced them to the smallest compass, so that they became, as it were, airtight. In that state they might be preserved for years, and yet the vegetables when dressedwere of precisely the same character as before; the vegetables possessed the same nutritive quality, and evea the same appearance, with the exception that they were smaller in size. As an instance of the astonishing effects of Masson's process, the learned counsel exhibited to the jury a cake of vegetables four inches square and a earter of an inch thick, which lwhen dressed would form ralons ofI
tables for five persons. He also exhibited another cae 61b. in weight, and which appeared to be about one foot square and an inch and a-half thick, which the learned counsel said would fornu rations for 145 persons. The cake at present was hard and dry, but when dressed itwouldcome out like vegetables dressed for dinner; and the learned counsel added that he had given directions that some of it should be dressed in the course of the inquiry for the satisfaction of the jury. (Laughter.)
Mr. JAais suggested that an aitchbone of beef should be added. (Lughter.)
dSir F. T Er aid Masson's invention consisted of the combination of desiccation and compression, resulting in an irticle entirely new. He understood that the plaintiff was threatened wish hops and tobacco, which were compressed, but the jury would recollect that that was for the purpose of stowage merely.
LordCasnxPszirL instanced hay, which was compressed for tho same purpose.
Sir F. THESIGER.-And cotton. The defendant would also refer to the case of dried frit, figs, and raisins. Maeson's process -was one combined of drying or desiccating the article and compressing it; and that process had never been practised before Macson bad taken out his patent.
Mr. JaES here observed thaBt the question -was whether the paintiff could prevent everybdy from doing what they had done before.
Sir F. TYsiGR said he would undertake to prove that WarnekYs patent, on which the defendanit would rely, -was identicalewith the plaintiff's. The plaintiff manufactured his cakes in France, beause he was able to do it there more cheaply than he could in England.
The deed of assignment executed by the patentee to thoe plaintiff, on the 28th of March, 1855, was then put in.
*fr. JAms at once took the objection that the plaintiM could not sustain the action without proving that the assignment had been registered in " The4 egiste of Pro.prietors," as required by the Patent IAW fAmendment Act5 1852. The 3Sth section of the statute (the 15th and 16th Victoria, cap. 83) enacted that there should be kept in the office for filing specifications in Chancery a book entitled "The Register of Proprietors," in which shall be entered the assignment of any patent &o.; that certified copies of srch entries shall be Pri2naO74e proof of asggn. rnalt of such letters patent; "provided always that until su9h entry shall have ben made the grantee or grantees of tih2 letters patent shall be deemed and taken to be the sole nd exclusive proprietor, or proprietrs £of such letters
J,,ord Cani u said that, but for the proviso, he showld latOe thought the section wras merely dirwect.
- r JrjFsvssaid there was apIes -which raz~ed t{iia ques. tion, that the patent was not duly assigned. HIis learned
hmend (mr. rindmarch), who had Considered the point, felt confident the objection was a good one.

Lord CA.SBEL'L thereupon directed the jury to find a verdict for the defendant upon the issue as to the assignment, and discharged the jury fromn giving any verdict as to the other issues.
Sir F. THm4XR then explained thathe had declined to be nonsaited, having in view the proceedings that would be taken in the Court of Chancery.
This sudden termination of a trial which was expected to lat nesrly tho whole day caused a considerable amount of merrnnent to some and disappointmeut to others in court.

Mr. Pearce, in the absence of Mr. M. Chambers, conducted the case for the plaintiff; Mr. Hill, Mr. Wilde, and Mr. Chandler were counsel for the defendant.
The plaintiff is an American, carrying on an extensive business at Norwich, in the State of Connecticut, United States, in indiarnbber golohes, his affairs in London being managed by Mr. Harrison, who is well known in the trade as his agent. This was an action to recover the amnount of two bils of exchange for 1001. and 55L. resectively, a- eepted by the defendant and drawn by one hncclestone, both of whom axe in tbe shoe trade. The question substantially raised by the pleas of the defendant, was whether hewaslabletomore tnan&. in the pound on the two bills, and that depended chiefly on the character in which Mr. Harrison had signed a composition deed, together with the creditors of the defendant accepting that amount. On the one hand, it was contended that heWad so signed in his own-private individual character in respect of two other acceptances by the defendant, and not as the agent of and as representing Mr. Blackstone; on the other the contention was that there was not any distinction to be drawn between the acts of Mr. Harrison and Mr. Blackstone, and that as the latter had signed for two bills held by him in the person of Mr. Harrison, he could only recover the composition on the others which was paid into court. After evidence had been piven on both sides the jury solved the problem submitted to them by returning a verdict for the defendant.

This was a meeting for the last examination of the directors of the bank.
Mr. Linklater appeared for the assignees, and Mr. Lawrance, Mr. Piphard, Mr. Chidley, M r. lteed `Mr ason and MJr Maraden for vaious dirtors, shareholders, and creditors.
Mr. M'niT, for Mr. Wlliam Adcock, applied for an order for the payment of the dividend under the following circumstances :-Mr. Charles Hunter was a depositor to the amount of 1,0661. in the bank. In September last he sold that debt to lr. Adcock. Inquiry was made of the official assignee, and the debt was assigned to Mr. Adcock in November, 18o6. Subsequently Mr. Linklater had required an examination of the assignment, and was satisfied. On aplication being made for the dividend, it was found that ac Mnwaswlodged on behalf of Mr. Weatberfield. Mr. Hunter, it appeared, was alleged to have entered into an agreement vwth Mr. Weatherfield for the purchase of a house, and for which he was to be given two deposit notes of the bank for 7111. .3Mr. Weatherfield, as he was instructed, could not etablish a title, and Mr. Hunter thought that the purchase had gone off.
Mr. PIPIARE asked for anadjournment. Mr. Weathere field was ill, andinquiry was desirable and neceswary. Mr.
unter had absconded after the agreement was made.
Mr. LINEb&TAT said the assignees had no interest in tbe matter.
The Coswxssxoi-Mr. Weatherfield's claim is limited to the deposit notes of 7111. The other part is undisputed?
The Court was informed that this was so.
The COMmssioNm said Mr. Hunter had proved the debt, and they had his affidavit that the debt was due to himsel£ TheCourt could not, behind his back, order the amount of the dividend to be paid to hMr. Adeock when another claim was put in. There must be an adjournment, and Mr. Elunter could be examined.
Mr. M' Nz.-We do not know where he is, further 1than he is abroad.
Thcn CohmisbIOR-Ia am sorry I cannot, under the circumstances, help you. There must be an adjournment.
Mr. Li XBm said he 'would just mention that there was also another climant for the dividend, arising from an a.ttachment in the Lord Mayor's Court.
An adjournment of the claim was then ordered to the 12th Mr. LUTJ!IkvxT said, this was the day appointed for the last examination of the directors, who were requirod to file the balance-sheet of the company. It wasnot expectedthat the accounts would be ready so as to enable the directors to pass to-day, and indeed there were certain inquiries now in progress which it was essential should be first concluded. Those inquries would be prosecuted with due diligence, and Mr. Coleman, the accountant,-stated that he would rouirl
amonth or five weeks before the balance-sheet could be completed. It was necessary that the assignees should have abundant opportunity of investigation, and he (Mr. Linklater) proposed therefore that the sitting should be adjonrned for at least t'wo months. A dividend of 5s. 6d.in the pound had been already paid on proofs amounting to 517,0001., so that there would not be many more to come against the estate, and he expected to make another dividend early in next mnonth. Under these circumstances, the assignees recommended that an Adjournment should be ordered for two months or more, and by that time it was to be hoped that the accounts would be filed, and that the assignees would bave hadanoportunityof investigating them. Jlr. Linklater continued,- we are also in hopes that before then matters wMl have so far progressed that we may be able'to announce the fact that sLuareolders are no longer in peril from proceedings of individual creditors. The assignees are desirous of impressig upon creditors the great importanee of withholding proceedings against individual share olders, in order that the general arrangement for comnpromise may not be frustrated, by depriving us of the fands that would otherwise be subscribed by these shareholders who are willing to do the general body, but who, in the event of individulproceedings; against them, may be driven out of the country or forced to seek protection fromi this Court.

The Lords Justices intimated that, After such a lapse of time, it would be an inustice to allow such an application to succeed, funds baving been divided and acts done by the assignees on the faith of the order miaintaining the bankruptcy being acquiecd in by allparties.

ce-rned; they wil not be exposea to Any more Mlt--- gaton,andth shrehldes avenowcoe to the unainius esoutin - raie as~eentfund jor the~aymnt of com?ostion wich isaduartted
enable the shareholders to carry out this arrangement. It is Only upon occasions of thi3 kind that the assignees haye the Opportunity ofexpre3sing to the public how txceedingly important it is that there should lbe an end of individual process which canl but have the effect of exhausting means thato oht to beapplicable to thpepyment of thedebts.
Mr. L4WnAx-ci&There is no objection to the adjourn. rnent proposed by my friend Mr. Linklater-it is simply a question of time. Shareholders should now use their beet exertions to carry out the compromise to which the assiguees ard commiltee of depositors, as far as they can in their corporate character, and almost without exception in their inddual capacty as creditors, have given their consent; and are wiling to give their co-operation. The proceedings taken by individual creditors agaitst shareholders have had the effect of sending from the country many of those from whom the largest amount of contribution was expected. The creditors as a body have been most considerate and forbearing, and the aggravated and vetious nature of such actions as have been commenced arises from the multiplicityof the notices to recover the same debt. In one case, where the debt was originally 4.l., the creditor, a woman proved that debt under the bankruptcy and -eeeived the dividend of 5s. 6d. in the pound, thereby reducing the balance to about 301. An action was brought against the offic.lal manager and judgment was obtained against him. Executions were levied-in three different counties for the purpose of obtaining a return of
iniaM bona, and no less than nine notices were served on nine different shareholders ia respect of that wretched fragraent of a debt. The costs thereby incurred amounted to at least thrice the sum sought to be recovered, or rather the sum due, for It would he erroneous to say, that the attorney was seeing to recover payment of the debt. I wish to impress upon the shareholders for their own sakes the absolute necessity of disearding .aU personal considerations, and At once ssmisting the assigees in carrying out a compronise to which they have aready given their cordial and ready assent. Creditors, even the mogt forbearing and most considerate, cannot be -pected to abstain from pro' ceeding for an indefinte period, and unless the shareholders will exert themsilves to raise a sxuffiient fund, it is clear that such eases as that I havo already mentioned will not be exceptions. Iaam bound to tatethat the proceedings which take place here and obtain publicity represent but a very, very small portion indeed of the peEsonal labour and anxiety, and the sacrifice of domestic comfort; which have been undergone by those interestea in the affairs of thin bank, whether acting as solicitors for the assiguees or for shareholders, with a view to the ultimate settlement of the affairs of the eomnany, The assignees have, through, my friend Mr. Lina ter, soown the greatest dedire to meet the committee of shareholders, and t a recent meeting of their committee Mr. Wyld, the chairman, whosetalent is so well known, evinced the utmost anxiet to asist the shareholders by bringing
his influence to bear upon the creditors for their bene&t. I Under those cireumstances, I hope that my friend's pro- I phecT will be abundantly verified, and that at the next] meeting we may have to report a general settlement of all theaffairsofthebank. Atallevents,theshareholderswill nvow see that this desirable result depends upon themselves.
Afr. RDx.-I will only add one word, and that is rather in corroboration of what my friends have stated. I cannot allow the oDportUnity to pass without expressing, on the part of the shareholders and directors whom I represent, and I think I may say the shareholders generaly, the obligations which they owe both to the assignees and to the solicitors for the assignees for the mauner in which they have conducted all the proceedings relating to this estate. We have received the greatest forbearaneo froma them, and the greatest assistance.
Mr. LAwisCAe-I ought to have stated that the application of yesterday was made nominaly at the instance of a smgle shareholder, and was loudly protested against by those shareholders whom my friend and I represent, and that we instructed counse representing shareholders to an enormous amount to urge the Lords Justices to refuse the applieation. We felt that the application to appeal was most injurious and vexatious, and, m fact, most wieked.
,Mr. Ln-g T'rss- can say, for the assignees, that they have no greater anxiety than to bring about this general
The ConssrmoNz.-On the part of the Court I have had oecsion more than once to express my sense of the satisfactory way in which the proceedings have been conducted on the part of the assignees and of their solicitors. As regards the shareholders, t is only by unanimity that there can be a possibility of their doing what will be satisfactory to the creditors. Without unanimity I very much fear things will remain in the same position in which they

(Beforc fr. PAfli, Q .C, AwWant4udge, at West-
minster.)
Alfred Smith, a6 respectableI-lookinF man, surrendered in discharge of his bail to answer in indictment charging him with having stolen 498 artificial teeth, the property of William Harnett, his master.
Mr. Cole prosecuted; Mr. W. Cooper appeared for the prisoner.
-rom the opening statement of the learned counsel for the prosecution it appeared that tho prosecutor is a mannfacturer of artificial mineral teeth, residing in Panton. square, Haymarket, and the prisoner had been for some time past-betwecn three and fouryears-in hisomployment as traveller. When he went on his jorneys he took with him a. number of Mr. Ilarnett's teeth and surgical instruments, being also permitted, by arrangement, to sell brushes on commission for a person named Cope. In the month of December he went on what was termed the northern Journey, taking with him a large number of teeth, made up into sets, and composed of a. mineral substance of which he could give no partoular description, as its manufacturewas a secret in the trade. He retumed from this journey on Saturday night, the 6th of December, and on the following 3onday morning Mr. Hlrnett spoke to the prisoner, andtold him that he had found that he was dencient in his accounts, and zequested him to make them up immediately. Ho sent a clerk named Simpkins upstairs with the prisoner into the room where the trays of teeth *erekept, anI the prisoner had no sooner canght sight of the box containing the trays of teeth than he said that the trays had been tampered with, and that some of his teeth were deficient A further exaimnation took place, and it was discovered that no less a number than 498 teeth were deficient. That being the case, the prisoner was given into custody on another charge that was not now the subject of investigation; he was taken before a magistrate and remanded, when something came to the knowledge of Mr. Cope, the gentle. man for whorft the prisoner sold tooth-brushes on his journeys, which excited suspicions in his mind, and he communicated them to Mr. Earnett. On a particular morning a person called at Mr. Cope's bouse, in.naryloebone-street, and left a prcel for Smith. On the following Monday morning he handed over this parcel to MIr. Barnett. This pared vas sealed with the gisoner's seal, and directed to nimself m his owa hnwriting, as follows:-" Mr. A. D. Smith, 2 Park-treet, Bristol, care of fis. Smith. Keep drys" policeman was ent for, and the parcel was opened, and was found to contain 591 teeth, which were at once idetiied as the prop3rty of the prosecutor The jury would have to say whether they had any doubt that the prisoner intended to steal these teeth, as they were direct to himself at his aother's house at Bristol a nd there was this additional fact, the prisoner's next journey was the western district, and Bristol came into it. The prisoner had access to 3r. Hlarnett's warehouse, PLndl on an examination of the -stock being made, it was ascertainecd that between 6,000 and 7,000 teeth were deficient; and, on going through the acounts ifor the year, a total deficiency of A1273 teeth was a p parent. Such being the state of the case, he believed, by th-e evidence be should call shndfll ae n h
eharge against the prisoner. ,he shouldfully make out the
Witnesses wfere called to prove the above facts, after which
Mr. CooMM made a long and very able address to The jury, contending that npon the facs proved there was no case of larceny aganst e prisoner.
Witnesses were then examined as to transactions they had had with t& - psoner, and also as to his exoellent characteri. .

Thoeprioner was then detained on a charge of embezzle. inent.l ana sent toE'the HIouse of Daeintion.
Albert Simpsop, 30, painteir, and William Gordon, 22, labourer, were %idicted for stealing a coat and a handk-er-
chief, the property of Henry Archibald Hinton, and a co t ana a scarf, the property of Frederick Curtis.
Simpson pleaded " Guilty."
Mr. SLEIGH appeared for Simipson, who he said, was a person of superior educationand good family, but had been
riven into the oommission of crime by sheer want and r ecessity. Within the last few days he had come into considerable property by inheritance and though the prisoner had been beore the Court on a' prevous occasion (for a
wtch robbery at the Turkish Divan, in the Ha3 market), it yvas to be hofedthpit the Court would take such a course as -would -ab e the prisoner, through his altered circumnstances, to seek another country, whoee he would have no need to resrdt to dishonest coursen
The ASLwSTANsT-JUcDGi thought those wore grounds rather for an applUcation to th Secretary of State tni for consideration by the Court.
The ease was then proceeded with against Gordon. Th3 evidence went to show that he had been conneoted with Sinpson fn going sbout 1with false latchkeyi opening door, andTclearing the pssges of the houses they visited of hats, coats, umbrelas, or whatever they could lAy bands upon.

Teprosecutors are brasafounders, &c., carrying on an extnsive business in Holborn, and it appeared that on the evening of the 2bd of January the prisoner Watkins got a quantity, of lead pipe off the premises, the other prisoners being in waiting osutside to take it away. ne bhaied a cab, and plamd the pipe inside it, when he was ieuestioned by a policeman, Ford, 328, who haed been watohing his proceedings, and the result was that he took him into custody. AckerOr.in sid he was going to takoe the pipe tohis Iaster's 28, Whitecross-stieeto; bt nor such number oould be founa in that street, and be then said he bad it from a mnan whom he did not know, and had never seen before.

Mr. CREAsy sentenced Watkins to four months' hard labour; Ackermann to eight months'.
Thomas Williams, 36, was indicted for unlawfully and corruptly taking fram John Davis thesmofs.d.nac
count of aidinig h to recover a dog, Isisrop'e'rty,th-en in. the possession of a person not the owner t?'ereof.
M1r. Orridge was-counsel for the prosecuLtion; Mr. Ribton for the prisoner.
It appeared that the prosecutor, a tailor in Broad-stree-, Golden-square, iost a terrier upon which he set some valudin and bills were issued, stating that any person bringing the dog to his residence would be rewarded. Shortly afterwards the prisoner went to him to treat for its restoration. He said a dealer had bought it for a sovereign, and wantod a like smg to restore it. By arrangement the prosecutor met the prisoner at a ptbhichose in L Finsbur-placenorth, where they had some conversation about the dog, and sub seutly, having conferred with a policeman, he marked a shill"n and sixpence, which he gave the prisoner as part of the reward. A ipoliceman was cOise aLt hand, and the prose. enter gave the prisoner into cuatody.

Mr. r.s said it Appeared fromn the prisoner's antecedents that this was not the first tinie he had been engaged in such transactions ad he had h4d several short terms of imrsnent. li would now see what effect a sentence of sixm_oOnths' hard labour would have.

Sir,-I have to thank you for inserting my letter of yesterday's date. Jad you omitted appending a note to it I should not have felt myself called upon to trouble you with any further remarks, but it has become necessary to do so now, because I imagine you have not understood my mneaning, otherwise you could not have called my letter irrelevant.
According to your view of the case, and having before you the dates of each officer's promotion, you conclude that it is quite right, fair, and reasonable thatCaptainTulloch should be promoted to be an unattached major over the head of Captain lRumley, but that it is perfectly the reverse when Colonel Rumley is promoted over the head of Coloncl Tulloch.
I beg you wil take into account the fact that the services which gained for Captain Tulloch the rank of major, and soon afterwards that of lieutenant-colonel, were of a civil natur, and that military officers, of whom I am one, have considered, and do consider, promotion to military rank for such services to be a gro-s injustice, as4d a very cruel hardship inflicted upon those who stick to their profession.
Colonel Rumley was selected, according to the Qaeen's warrant of October, 1854, for a command as a major-general 'with temporary rank, which will be confirmed after ho has served five years satisfactorily. It is much to be wished that this power of selection should always be exercised with as sound a judgment-ss it has been in his case.
It would be just as reasonable to make a major-general of Sir John AI'NeilJ, who is a civilian, as to promote Colonel Tolloch, because the remarkable sort of service to which you allude, and which these two gentlemen have performed, does not give any claim to military rank, and I
lieve that every military officer will agree with me in this assertion; but we should have beenvery glad if the Government had thought fit to give Colonel Tnlloch a civil decorationof theBath, 'which is a proper reward for civil services.
I have the honour to he. Sir. vn,,r eThpildt rPrvant.

TxWRSDAY EvaMr. ENCUHUMRED ESTATES COURT.
Mr. Henry Martley has been appointed Chief Commissioner at a salary of 3,0001. a-year. The appointment is a most admirable one. A comumisnionership was first offered to Mr. FrancisFitzgerald,. the eminent Chancery lawyer, and refused under any conditions. The offer was then made to Mr. Martley, who declined its acceptance save as the successor of Baron Richards in the post of Chief Commisioner. This was refused, and Serjeaut O'Brien was then applied to; but he, too, would hear of nothing but the higher office. Thus circumnstanced Government was compelled to yield, and, as a matter of cour.a, the place of Chief wasangain offered to and accepted by Mr. Martley. The new commissioner is brother-in-law of Lord Justice Blackburne, and his practice both in law and equity placed him in the front rank of the Irish bar. Should ther Encumbered Estates Court be hereafter abolished, and its powers transferred to Chancery, it is understood that Mfr. Martley's claims to a seat on the judicial bench will be fully recognized

TO THE EDITOR OF TIE TMS.
Sir,-I have perused the letter in your columns of to-day from the Presidentof the Georgia Railway, and also the depositions and certificates accompany. ing. My attention was attraoted to the day mentioned iu the depositions-viz., Thursday. Recollecting it was Friday I left Macon, and Saturday morning that I arrived inAugusta, I have referred to my diaxy, which I had not with me when I wrote my narrative, and which I have never opened since ity arrival till now, and there I find the following entry:-
." Friday, Aug. 29.-Left Montgomery at 6 a.m. for Columbus; 3 p.m., left Columbus for Macon; left Macon for Augasta at a quarter past 7p.m.; reached at 3i am."
For the fault of writing so grave a narrative without careful reference to the most minute part!. culars I am to blame.
The accuracy of this extract from my diary can be tested by the President, or any one intersted, by reference to the registeis of the Augusta h:otel at Augusta, the hotel at the railway termL mus,M aeon, the hotel at Columbus, and at the Montgomery-hall, Montgomery, in which registers I-signed my name. In connexion with my name at these places is that of a gentleman who travelled with me from Mobile, whose name I do not recoL lect. There are also other names in connexion with mine at Augusta and Macon of persons who, no doubt, travelled in the same train wit7i me. If any of these could be brought forward to give like evidence the denial would be complete, and I should be happy to partake of the unbelief it would warrant; but it would not establish for me, with those who know me, a character for "mendacity" or depravity of mind and intellect, nor wvould it ever obliterate from my mind the sight of the body of the young man kllled in the car or the tears shed by the fatber, who went in the same omnibus to the hotel in Augusta with me, when he said he was the last child left.
Were I as free to meet the Judgment-day as I am in this matter it would be well with me.

Sir,-Colonel Wetherall again assails Colonel Tulloch in your impression of this day. He now attempts to show that Colonel Tulloch's suggestion, that the clothing of the army, for want of which the troops were perishing in December, 1854, might have been carned to the front by fatigae parties from the various regiments, was absurd. In order to prove this Colonel Wetherall more absurdly assumes that Colonel Tulloch's idea was that every regiment in the Crimea should have performed this operation on the same day and at the same moment. Had they done so, says Colonel Wetherall, the entire position of the British army would have been denuded of troops.
Very likely. But Colonel Tulloch never proposed anything of the kind. The operation which he suggested would doubtless have been a very laborious one; many lives might have been expended in carrying it out, but certainly not so many as were nightly sacrificed for want of clothing and shoes in the December and January of that terrible winter campaign. Moreover, the Highlanders, the Guards, and some other regiments were not at that time worked with such fatal Eeverity as the troops more im'mediately employed in the trenches. They are shown to have carried up daily quantities of heavy munitions of war. Important as it might be to have plenty of ammunition in front, it as surely no less importan. to have plenty of live men to use it; and it is not unreasonable to suppose that if at that time the army had had mnore clothing there would have been less disease and fewer deaths.
It is curious to observe how silently and patiently the officers whose characters are chiefly impugned by Colonel Tulloch's pamphlet bear themselves; while Colonel Wetherall, wbo was himself in no degree assailed by the report of the Crimean Commisioners,
nushes himself forwfard to pick these small holes in~ his statements, 'with, I am happy to show, very indifferent success.
It must not be forgotten, too, that Colonel Wetherall is the very o6fcer who was but a fewvdays ago complaining that his own evidence had beentao closely sifted,and whoobservedthat he would mcuh prefer that 'it hould be taken "as a whole I" He does not, however, appea, disposed to concede to others the unusuail and convenient privilege whichhe damims for-hifelf.m
Hisattempt to raise utp a sh'elte'r for Crimean' delinquency behiind " lord iaglan's memory" is nota. newr trick. - It had-already -been worn threadbare by G'eneraI .Airey.'

there, Bevan, G. Moore, W. T. Maxwell, J. PAyle, --. Fowler, P. Cuthbertaon, - Mattheson. S. W. Siva, &cB; wbile in the body of the meeting there was a large attend. ance of tho riends of the institution, including a great number of ladies. Apologies -were read from Lor m naird, the ofBishs o Loin,don, Crlisle, and Ripon, and several other welknown supporters of ragged seools
Prayer hxving been ofrered up by the Rev. Tf. Cox, the LonD &Yo called upon the hon. secretary to read the report
It set forth that since last year the number of schools had increased from 136 to 150; that in the last three years grants bad been voted in the aggregate to the amount of 12,4121; that the income-tax, the high price of provi; sioan, ana other causes arising out of the late warhad seriously embarrassed the committees of local schools, and prevented the parent society's ineome from increasing in proportion tothe clain made upon it. Toheresult was that the balanod of 5,4001., which was held by the society in 184, was almost exhausted, and a debt had been contracted. It being now weigiht years since a special appeal was made by the committieefor funds,N theytreasted withocoDfidencothat aliberal and hearty response would be made to the claims of the society.
A list of subscriptions already received, amounting to upwards ef L3001W, was then read
The Loss Ki.Yon said that, after the gratifying report and list of subscriptions the m eeting had just heard read, little need be said to induce the public to continue their exertions on behalf of so excellent an institution. The quesion had been asked, what was to become of their destituto and criminal population ? He thought it was a question much more easily answered than was generally suppoed (Hear, bear.) He believed that by taking boys from the streets, throutgh the instramentality of the rag"ed schools, the criminal and destitute population of tbe metropolis might be reduced to a very great extent. (Hear, hear.) Destitutionstaring themin the face, those boys were nattirally impelled to commit crime. HaigwtiBh lastfewdayseardmauchof the destituteBcnditin the poor, he, in company with the Rocorertokangtie
of some of the plaes f refuge to which hand other city magistrates were in the hbit of sending them for the night, and he was horror stricken at what he beheld. He went to the West London Union to visit the casual ward; but to his astonishment he found the was no such ward. The poor wretched creatures who were sent to the union were given tickets, requiring them to go a distance of two or three miles to find a placo of shelter-it was neari Battlebridge, -and when they got there the only shelter afforded them was a large able, capable of holding 12 horses, but without the least morsel of straw to lie on, and their only relief was a small portion of bread. (Cries of "Snhane!") If thepoor were treated in such a way as that, was it not natural that they would resort to crime rather thansbmitto it? (Hear, hear.) Mueh bad been said of the great benefits that would result from the reformatories; but, in his opinion, the reformatories and ragged schools must go hand-in-hand to.ether,-at the same time that reformatories would not be so mach reqtired when ragged schoo!s were iu fall operation, because the number of criminals would, by means of those institutions be very materially lessened. He, therefore, heartily e5cet the hublic would contnue to support this goed waork, and, br geving employ
ment and religous instruction to the juvemile vaorat popa. lation, check the spread of vice and crime inb this great metropolis. (Cheers.)
The Earl of SwAsThseImY, in rising to move the first resolution, observed, in reference to what had been inci
dentally Eaid by the Lord Mayor respecing the casual wards of the metropolis, that nothing more vile or more pro. dctive offvic and emisery could possibly be conceived than thosecasal wards. Those wfards were more particularly connected with the poor *and regged classes, on whose behalf that meeting was then assembled. He sincerely hoped the voice of that meeting would go forth and beheard, and that somec efficient remedy would he applied to a state of things which he knew to be the cause of so much crime andmisery; and, although it was by no means desirable that anything should be done to pamper those who were called paupers, yet there was a mode of giving them relief ard of minister. ing to their wants without exposing them to insolence and oppression. (Hear, hear.) Their business that day was not so much to go into the history, details, and working of their institation as It was to show that the exigency for its existence oontinued as urgent as at auy former period. He could sayfrom his own experience that these establishments had been carriod on with the utmost care, and had beenproductive of,the greatest benefit, morally physica31, and religiously, to the children who were the especial objects of them. With regard to the debt which had been contracted by the parent society, he considered it had been contracted in a most legitimate manner. If the union had not advanced the money to the schools thousands of children must have been turned into the streets. They had therefore spent money liberally, but at the samo time justly and econonically. They had spent it on the faith that God would movo the hearts of the citizens of London to subscribo their money, that the benefit of theze institutions mig ht be extended throuah the length and breadth of this vast metropolis. His lordship then noticed the objection which had been urged against the use of the term " raggcd" as applied to these schools, and said tha. from long expernence hewas convinced of the vital importance of that epithet to the good working of the schools. It designated the class for which the schools were intended. It was a class so peculiar and so distinct, having its own habits, manmers, feelngs-he had almost said its own natural history-that no ordinary appliances, no common machinery such as they met with in daiy operation, would at allb applisable to that class. If they wishe& to get rid of the epithet "ragged" they must get rid of the ragged class altogether by improving the moral and physical condition of the people. (Cheers.) Bat it was a benefical term; for,while it prevented the inroad into the schools of children whose parents were themselves able to give them an educationand many such parents might seek to avail themselves of these schools, in order to save the 2d. or 3d. a week which they would have to pay for a superior school-it at the same time was the means of inducing thousands of children to enter them-children shoeless, shirtless, unclothed-from the belief that the schools were for their especial benefit, who would not otherwise come near them. But when they used the term "ragged schools," it was not their object to keep the chUdren ragged. They received them ragged, but their object was to tarn them out clothed, as their object was to reeeive them heathen and turn them out accomplished Christians. (Cheers.) They were told that, after all their efforts, Londonvwas notwithout its thousands of roving and mendicant children- but had the society ever had Lrndon under its commandi lHad they ever had the means of covering all London with these institutions? They never pretended that these schools would be more than a palliative for the eviL. But this rrerit the aociety did claim that whale others had been deliberating and debating in high beynngthe n y dakenthe- boll by the horn.s, and, rememcl:ug hstevey dy tousndsof children were being bor a growing up into manhood without the first principles of Chritianity being instilled into their minds, they had by their exertions introduced them to a knowledge and the fear of God. (Cheers.) He would appeal to any man who had a shadow of principle in him-who had the slightestmknowledge of the human heart, whether it was not far better that they should have dono what they had done than that they shoald have left for 20 years to come those thousands of children to wander uncared for over this metronolis, to bo plunged into crime or hurried into an early grave through the miseries and sufferings to which they had been exposed. He believed that if ragged schools were established throughout the densely-ponalated districts of the country it would go far indeed t resolve many of the difficulties which now beset the various questions of reformatories, refuges% tickets of leave, transportation, and penal servitude which they had been diccussing for many
ears, and concerning which they even yet did not seem to Lave arrived nearer to a result than when they first began. It must also be borneinmindthatthe benefitsarisingfromthese schools were not confined to the children who were educated in them. Some5IO,000 childrenhadpas.edthroughtheschools; but he, from his own personal observation, knew that the infuence of the systemuponthegreat massof the population of London had been most beneficial. It had soothed many an angry spirit ithad encouraged many asinking heart. It had shown to the working people that persons of p operty, stati-on, and influetce, a&s wenl also persons who, wisthout these advantages, were endued with hrstian roinp II
good, honest men and women, with the fear of in their hearts and the love of the human race-it showed them that there were thousands of such persons who did care for tne great mass of the working people; and, sceing this, they felt that there was an acknowledgment of their rights and a respect paid to their wants and feelings, and that, althon h they themselves were not personally the individuals W"To derived the benefit from these institutions, still they shared the homage paid to their class and sat down in contentment andgratituae. (Cheers.) Thegreatestdifficultyinteaching the wild and rovmig classes was to give them notions of pro.
poery anuinoionsof thitaud economy. sindyotby the zeilof their tcachers in 60 schools a pennybruez ad been established,
and the tesult had been a saving among those -children in a single year of no less a sum than 2,30L (Cheers.) This fact alone reflected the greatest credit upon the teachers, and proved them to be what he would ever assert them to be, one of the most valuable and most meritorious race of peoplehebadeverknown. (Cheers) This ragged-school system,theymight depend upon it,would be found some day to have produced a greaterand more lasting effect upon the moral character of this kingdom than almost any one effort ever mado by the religious and humane public of this empire. It was only by takdng these children earl in life andi'eeping them from that which was the great bane and curse of the working clses-the bottle and habits of drink, -and bringing them up to habits of moderation and sobriety, that they could insure a happy and contented popution. To cut the matter siort, to takc tho charge of these children, and rescue them from their vice and misery, wms the will of God; it was the precept of the Lord, and the
lnt of the GospeL Act only in conformity with that will, nd, pon i they would soon find that virtu-
oas-mendan& virtuous women were far above rubies, and that the strength of the Queen of these realms was in the morals and multitudesof her people. (Choers.) The noble lordoncluded by moving the following resoution:-
