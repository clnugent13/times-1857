GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY, GenVemem To the PROPRIETORS.
-FT is of the UtMOSt importance that your immediate Ja. and careful1 attention be directed lo the present management ofCthe coal trafilic ever your line ; and we appeal to you, In the inteceets of commercIal pOlicy and luetlop, to demand [rein your Directors the fair and equail treatment ot all the coal traders rand ustomers on your lHne of railway.
We re argly ngaedin the coal trade from the Dean Forest, Rad-
stoc, Bistl. ad SothWales mineral diBtricts, aLnd, collectlvcly, wa' are arringn eTr yur arous lines an extensive traffic, capable
(uner qutabe ad ibealtreatment) of analmoet.lndelluitelncreaso' at rmnuratrs ate ofcarriage,
The ate thtwearenow paying, and have for soose time paid, are die, b th Rilwy Cmpay,atabhalf-penny per ton per mille for Powr ndrod,is el,pe tn I or terminals, anud one-eighth of a
pe per emlefrthe uee of the Company's irucks ; and they samefortel tran ladsas for single trucks.
awe ar siiom u,ad believe, that the rates charged to the Ruabon Coal Conpany ame seven-slxteenthss of a penny pr ton per mile for Power anid re#ad with two-pence per ton for termials, &an one peony per ton for trana-ehioment. at the break of gauge, with Is. per ton for the use of truek to convey the coel from Ruabent to London a distnceof 98 ile. Th chrge threfre,for the use of trucks for

and siigacmoaint ned th truoks upon one gauge only. But the charge of two-pence per ton fGr terminals to the Rtuabonx Coat Company reprientert the coDat upon bethi gauges; and, if your rates are fdied with reference to their more or less remunerative character to yourselves, the terminal charge to us should be lower than the samne chasge to othere, whxere a greater amzount of labour aLnd cost is ex-
Thus-Ruiabon coal, for 193 miles, pays St. Od. Der ton, and for 98 miles 4ei. 4e. per ton, including trucks; while Welsh, Dean Forest
Bristol, and, BasltoI coa pay, for alike dimtanoe, Ils. 10d. and Gs. Pd.
7eas3k Ir no favour; esepfly equal rater per ton per mile, equal terminials, and eqala charges for the use of the one broad gauge truck which convess our coal to market. asa for the two trucks 'which are pro. 'rided out of your capital for the Ruabon CoaLl Compny,
In addition to thiese unjust and Illegsl preferentialarrangements we are positiTely' assured that your Directors have actually entered finto an agreement to eharge you witltaportion of whatever bad debta may be made by the Ruabon C-oal Cempany in carrying on their London trade, having engagea to allow a further abatemenxt of one-half the tonnege rates upon all coal reoresented by the said bad debts.
We require only a fair ldeld and no favour, even agiAnst the officials of the Uompeny, to whom will still remain these indirect advantages which the leacing otilcera of a railway caLnnot fanl to secure for them. selves. We ask You not to permit the superintendents of your stations to continue to be paid agents and servants of one favouredi coal company; nor, by selling coal, to destroy a clawsof men who are amtong your beat customera, nor to receive commiseons from any tradeos and shus be
W~e are aware an intimation has beenl given that uinmilar arne mnents would be made with any other large colliery Proprietors wh may be di-Dosed to enter Into contracis of a sinilar mantude, but we fubmit ths.t any such attempt to force the entire coal raffic of your railway into the hands of powerfui monopollte, to the destruction of all the independent traders on your line, is not only Illegal, but inOeesy wa'T adverse to thbe interests of your railway and of the public.
}.sxuratly entreatlug you to restore to the conduct of the trade over your line the practice of equal dealin, and so develop the Inherent Titality and industria wealth of the district,

The resulta that have beeni obtainied by the difrerent industrlsl,un-
dertakings which have been rcemntl amalgamated together sbow, incontestably, that inx certain enterpie cetralization presents nodoubted advantages,Thiiss epeialyhecaneas regards locomotion, In which not onl hais the reduction of fare been obtained, hut increased facilties have been from time to time afforded to the public as the necessty for such aceommodation has arisn, while the crowded state of ouir thoroughfares (which are becoming more so every day by reasn of the railways spreadung their iron network into samcgt every villae In the kingdom, all centering In the metropolis), shnows the neseety of being peae to meet the increasing demandfor water carrage. "1The GreatHighway"' as the river has been most aptly salled, Is daily becominig more ana more In favour with the public assa meanis of transit; and, witht the Increased faciliteies, Its use and enjoy. moent will be the more apprecIated. allI whilch can only be obtained by the judicIous applicaton or a eafleMently large capital.
The sucoess of the London Gieneral Omnibus Company Is an example of what can be effected by a system of management which oombines the Power of caLpital with an experience that simplidies the service without weakening it, and it Is enable-d by its concentrationi to coinbush on a sound balis the improvements constantly demanded b, the public.
In azpplyng the foregoing principle to the conveync of pacoengers uponthe river Thames, it will be easiy vundeoon that by the union of two, at proewnt totally distinct estab lishments under one managmnent,ech canbe rendered more profitable,and beth wMlat the sme tim becariedon nbeerharmony with the wants of the public,

It Is therefore evident, that wi6h a trafaic of thin magnitude the business of the Thames presents a sourc of large profits, quite irrespective of the savings to be effected by the concentrati(on into one of two mana5eents, two establishments, and two sets of workshops. tools, d.

To the foregoing a moat important element of prosperity should be added that to be derived from the future development of the traffic

DUBLIN, SATURpAY htORNIWIa. THE ELECTIONS.
The nomiuation for Bandon is fixed for Wednesday next, and the poling for Friday. The candidates are the Hon. Captain Bernard (Conservative) and Mr. Shaw, Liberal, and a member of the Dissenting body of Churchmen. The chances of opening the borough are said to be extremely meagre. Downpatrick election commences on Monday. 1'he candidates are Mr. Ker, of Montalto, and Xx. William Johnstone, proprietor of the Downshire Protestant newspaper, and a high office-bearer in the Orange Institution. A stormy contest is anticipated, and in consequence a troop of Dragoons, two companies of infantry, and 150 of the constabulary, are to arrive thia day at Downpatrick.
TR" TTPPZBARY AINK.
A motion was made yesterday before Baron Greene, in chamber, that the conditional order obtained for liberty to issue a writ of scire facias against Mfr. Vincent Scully, M.P., be made absolute. The conditional order was granted on foot of a judgment obtained by Mr. Walker as public officer of the Newcastle B3nk, against the official manager of the Tipperary Banuk, for the sum of 25,0001. The three law courts had already granted writs of scire faaas against Mr. Scully in other cases, and on the last day of Michaelmas Term the Court of Exchequer granted an absolute order in the first instanCe. Counsel for Mr. Scully submitted that on the authority of a decision recently made in the case o' the British Bank it was the right of the shareholder here to have the question argued, and that it was not a matter of course to issue the writ. Orders for writs of scire faciashad been made absolute against Mr. Scully in other cases, and he pleaded to the actions, but notice of trial was afterwards withdrawn. The issue raised the same question that had been decided by the Lord Chancellor, and a judge sitting in chamber could not be called upon to dispose of this motion, which should stand over till next term. Baron Greene said he was not intimating any opinion against the right of the party to have the writ issued, but no judge sitting in England, as he was sitting there, would take on himself to decide upon suct a motion. It was one which should be brought before the full court for decision. Counsel for the bank contended that the effect of not issuing the new writ before the next term would be that there could not be a trial tiUl July, while, if issued now, the action might be disposed of at the ensuing assizes. Baron Greene finally ordered the motion to stand till the first day in next term, when it could be arguled before the full Court.
EDUCATIONAL GRIEVANCE.
A very decided Protestant journal, published in the loyal town of Enniskillen, narrates the following anecdote for the espeoial benefit of the opponents of the National system of education :-" A respectable Protestant merchant in this town," says the Fer1managh Reporter,-
"Made applicatien to some influential personage, and through thae influence procured the nomination of a friend's son to some situation under the Government. When the matter was made known to the father of the lad ho returned his thanks to the merchant, but owned that his son was unfit for the situation, owing to there being no school within reach at which an ordinary knowledge of acounts could be gained. This, the merchant says, was owing to the opposition made by the clergy and bogtrotting aristoacy to the National Board. The Dublin Protestant Association complains of Roman Catholic preponderance in the metropolitan police force; but if it be in Dublin as it is in Fermanagh we do not wonder at that. In this ancient, loyal, and Protestant county the ignorance of the Protestant young men is such that recruits cannot be had among them for the constabulary-they have not sufficient education to qualify them for even that humble station."X
THE VACANT MIThE.
Among the rumours of the day, in reference to the successor of Archbishop Slattery, the names of several clergymen have been named, the more prominent being Dr. Renihan, President of Maynooth; Dr. Leahy, Vice-Rector of the Catholic Jniversity and Dean of Cashel; and the Very Rev. Dr. Howley, parish priest of Tipperary.

LImCOiN, FEB. 7.
During the early part of the vreek the weather was fine and frosty,
and exceedingly favourable for wheat thrishing, which imoortant operation has been carried on rapidty. Be0ore the snow fell the young wheats were looking very healthy. Ilnwe that time they have been well protected from the severity of the weather; and it is accounted extraordinary that they should have flourished so well under thodiadrantagesof veryvarable sea The changeable weather damaged the turnip and coleedeodrops to a serious extent, the butbs havinc decared, and thote VhiehlDck sound haye lo,t theirreal vrtueKeepforstockislessplentiu stil there is a largarmountofmiaugold.

Money-Market and City Intelligence.
AOVB-ZMApBn.ETand IxTYMTBLLrxaB.w.
Saturday Evening.
'he English funds have been les steady to-day, and, notwithstanding the comparatively favourable figures of the Bank return, and the absence of any foreign news to exercise influence, the market has cloued heavily at a decline of a quarter per cent. Consols for money, which left off yesterday at 93 to i, were first quoted at 924 to 93; and the final transactions were at 924 to J for money, and 93i for the 5th of March. The speculative operations of the day consisted principally of sales, but the public showeed a disposition to make investments. Eank Stock cloted at 216 to 218; Reduced, 93 to
New Three per Cents., 93i to I; India Stoek, 18 to 220; In 'a-bonds, 2s. discount to Is. premium; Exchequer-bonds, 98j to I; and Exchequert ills, par to 3s. premium.
In the Stock-Exchangeto-day there was an inci (ased supply of mcney, and the charge for advances on Government securities was 6 per cent. In the disccunt-market there was a very active demand at full i ates, but the applications at the Bank are understcod to have been moderate.
A total of about 75,0001. in gold was withdrawn from the Bank to-day for exportation.
Foreign securities have not exhibited any important change, but prices were rather heavy towards the close. In Turkish Six per Cents. for money and the aQcount the transactions were at 93 . The Four per Cents. Guaranteed were negoiated at 100X-. The other operations eomprised Brazilian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 97i; Russian Iour-and-a-Half per Cents. (Small) 97; and SIanish New Deferred, for account, 23f?.
The inal quotations of the French Three per Cents. :V the Paris Bourse this evening were 68f. fcr money, and 68f. 20c. for the end of the month, showving a fractional advance from an inerease.0of speculative purchases. At Vienna there is again a tendency to improvement.
The Paris letters mention that the expectation of a lax on railway and other bonds and shares gains strength, but that the mode and extent of its proposed application are still uncertain. The new International Bank is in abeyance, but the impression is that it will be approved and introduced after a sbort delay.
It appears that the Rio Bank still finds itself unider the necessity of obtaining direct importations of gold to retrieve the errors in the management of its cireulation which were alleged in recent advices to have been committed. The Royal mail steamer Medway, which leaves Southampton on Monday for Brazil, will consequently take out 119,0001. in gold.
The following communication announces the result of the negotiations lately in progress for a compromise between the shareholders and the ereditors of the Royal British Bank. Six shillings and sixpence in the pound beyond whatever may be realized from the assets has been agreed upon as the contribution that would be equitable under the circumstanees:-
" South Sea-house, Feb. 7.
"Sir,-During the last fortnight commnunications have been constantly going on between the committee of the shareholders of the Royal British Bank and the committee of depositors. On Friday evening, at a full conference betWeen these two bodies, the accompanying resolutions were unasnimously passed. By the plan of compromise now adopted a way of deliverance is open to the shareholders, nnd it is hoped an end will be put to the fearful litigation that has been going on for some time past.
XI anm Sir, your obedient secrvant,
" Chairman of the Committee of Shareholders. * Resolved unanimously:-
" 1. The shareholders of the Royal British Bank (through their committee) propose and agree to pay to the creditors of the bank a composition of Os. 6d. in the pound, by two instalments, of 3s. in the pound on the 2d of March next, and 3s. Gd. in the pound on the 17th of April next, the creditors to receive such dividend beyond the assets under the bankruptcy, in disebarge of the debts due to them from the bank. The call of fiO. per share made by the directors not to be enforced after the acoeptance of the offer by the general body of creditors, and no proof to be made egainat the estate in bankrnptcy in respect of any deposit or ciaim jby ashareholder. The details of this arrangement to be agreed on between the solicitors of the committee of shareholders and the committee of depositors respectively.
"2. That it is desirable a receiver should be appointed, If practicable, so as to afford protection to the shareholders, and also that all the creditors should berequired to execate -a release to all the shareholders; but, whether such ap-
ointment be made or release obtained or not, the sharenolders pledge themselves to pay the composition of 6s. 6d. in the pound, as mentioned in the foregoing resolution."
The railway meetings of the week have presented tome facts of interest. The report of the directors of the London and South-Western Company states -that the balance available for dividend for the past half-year amounts to 238,5951., including 5,3471. from the last account. The dividend is to be at the rate of 61. 10s. per cent. per annum, leaving 7,0421 to be carried forward. A majority of the sUareholders of the Bedale and Leyburn Company have refused to accept the offer of the NorthEastern Railway Company, on the ground that the ternms are insufficient. The directors of the Ulster Company recommend a dividend of 30s. per share, being at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum, leaving 4,5501. to be carried to the reserve fund. The dividend of the Great Western is proposed at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum, and the remaining balance will be about 17,0001. The report of the Oxford, Worcester, and Wolverhampton Company has been adopted, and the payment of 6 per cent. on the first preference stock and interest, as proposed, has been agreed to. The directors hiave reduced the liabilities and expenditure, and it is now thought they will be able to place the undertaking in a more satisfactory position. At the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock, and Midland Junction meeting, the dividend of Is. 4d. per share, arising from the rent paid by the lessees, was declared. The MidcUesborough and Redcar and the lVear Valley Railway dividends, at the rate of 6 per cent., guaranteed by the Stockton and Darlirgton Company, have been declared. According to the report of the Stockton and Darlington Railway the dividend on the ordinary shares, after the liqtuidation of preference and rental charges, will be at the rate of 10 per cent. per annum. The report of the Cockermouth and Workington Company has been adopted (after the declaration of a poll, in which the numbers were equal) by the casting vote of the chairman. An inierease has taken place in the coal and general merchandise traffic during the latter part of the half-year, and economy will, it is believed, produce a gradual restoration to prosperity. The dividend of the NLorth Staffordshire Railway, at the rate of 31 per cent. per annum, has been contirmed, and the traffic continues to exhibit satisfactory progress. At the meeting of the Cromford aud High Peak Railway the report wvas agreed to, and the directors have been authorized to raise 6,0001. The dividenda of the St. Helen's Company have been declared in the following proportions :-at the rate of 2 per cent. on the stock A; 5 per cent. on stock 33; 6 per cent. on stock C; and 4} per cent. on gtock D.
()l Saturday last a bonus was declared by the Norwich Uniion Life-office upon all participating policies. The surplus distributed was 159,7111. 5s. 7d. in cash, equal to 260,6271. 5s. 7d. in reversionary additions. It appear-ed that the policies in force woele 10,132 ; the sums assured upon all risks, 5,592,4271. 13s.

TM CHESTER, FEB. 7.
The markeot continues dull, nothing having occurred during the past week to give an Impulse to business in any department. In yarns for Russia there is still a steady trade at dull prices, but almost every other kind of yarn and cloth has felt more or less the depression arising from an inactive and inconsiderable demand. In some Idnds of cloth pnces remain nominally the same as before, because no real test has been applied in the shape of offers of any magnitude; but India and China goods have given way rather more under the depression of trade, and sellers have been willing to accept lower rates. With dear cotton on one band, and inadequate demand on the other, coarse spinners are unable to realize remunerative rates, and attempts are makiDg at Manchester, Oldham, and some other places, to bring about a general restriction of production by resorting to short time.
BIRMINGHAM, FEB. 7.
'lThe iron trade of Staffordshire is reported to be quiet and steady. Prices are pretty well maintained; but any further advance which at one time might have been entertained has been abandoned. The mills and forges of the district are generally in full work, and several of the new establishments which have recently been erected will speedily be in operation.
The uncertainty which continues to exis with regard to the prices of metals is now in uriously felt bwth by manur facturers and factors. As litUle vork as possible is put in band, and a still further advance is confidently anticipated by large consumers. Some establishments are unable to obtain supplies of copper and brass at current quotations; and are thus unable in many instances to complete factors' orders wanted promptly for the country trade.
During the present week the annual or half-yearly meetings of several of the banking establishments of this town snd neighbourhood have been held. The several reports iEsued by the directors of these respective companies are satisfactory. The Birmingbam and Midland Ba g Company announce a dividend of 3 10s. for the half-year end. ing ecember last. The Stourbridge and Kidderminster directors declare a dividend of 7s. 6d. per share, free of income-tax, the dividend at the corresponding period of last year being 5s. per share. At the annual meeting of the Bilston Banking Company a statement was read from which it appeared that a profit of 3,8541. had been made during the year; a dividend of 3A per cent. was paid last June, and a further dividend of 4 per cent. was now recoimended. The report issued by the directors of the Wolverhampton and Staffordshire Banking Company showed that the year's profits amounted to 16,4131., and after addirg the balance left over on the 31st of December, 185, left 17,0311. to be dealt with; of this sum 5,001. had aieady been disposed of in the half-year's dividend of lOs. per share paid last September; a further dividend of the same amount was recommended for the half-year endir,g the 31st of December; of the residue it was proposed that 5,0001. should be added to the guarantee fund, making it 12,0001., the bal]nce, amounting to 2,0311., to be carried forward to the cl edit of the present year.
There still continues to be a considerable depression in all the branches of the building trade. Few, if any, public wvors are in progress, and at no former period did so many " tramps" pass through the town in search of employment.
Hundreds of applicants have been relieved by the officers of the various friendly and trades societies existing within the borough,
NOTTlNGHMU, FEB. 7.
A satisfactory amount of business is doing in the lace branches, the general demand being much greater than usual. Of coarse plain nets there is a great scareity. If twice the quantity coiuld be produced they would a find purchasers. There is also a large demand for curtains and curtain nets. The buyers in the market this week have consisted of Canadians, Germans, and representatives of the home-trade houses; and a number of good orders are being continually received from the United States. Notwithstanding this prosperous state of things, however, some of the machine owners complain much of the difficulty of working without loss, in consequence of silk, spun sil-, and cotton yarns having become so excessively dear. Even at full prices the better classes of yarns, made from Sea Islands cotton, are limited in supply.
Tho demand for hosiery continues good, the business having been fully as active as during any week since Christnias. Nearly aU the yarns now using by manufacturers were purcallsed at fuU list prices, and even low circular hose have within the last three months advanced from 4d. to 9d. per dozen. At these rates. however, the goods are eagerly sought after by the London and Manchester firms, who this year have delayed their purchases beyond the customary penod, in the hope of obtaining goods at lower p rices, and now are compeUed to supply themselves at full terms. Spinners of cotton yarns are very firm, at the highest rates; merino and woollen yarns have this week experienced a general advance of Id. 'These continnedadvances, although they do not materiaUy affect the demand, determanufacturers from making stocks, though the selling prices of cotton and woollen goods in December last were from 5 to 10 per cent. less than the present cost of production.
LEICESTER, FEiB. 7.
There is a slight improvement in trade as respects cotton goods, which are now in moderate request. In worsted and woollen articles, however, there is very little doing. For the
United States' market there are some inquiries for goods, but upon the whole business continues flat. Wools and y arns have still an upward tendency. A\t Hinckley and the country districts the hosiery trade is dull; stocks are low, bugt mantufacfturetre will not increase them at the present
LEEDS, FEB. 7.
The fpresent month is not likely to witness any unfavourab e alteration in the state of the trade of this district. Almost every branch of business is in a satisfactory condition, and there is but little want of employment.
In the woollen cloth trade there is no change of importance, and business continues steady. Several country buyers have been in the market during the week, making up small assortments, and a few purchases have been made on Canadian account for the ensuing autumn trade. In the cloth halls this morning transactions were upon a very fair scale, and a much better business was done than on Tuesday, but not equal to several preceding markets, Stocks however, are getting extremely low, which necessarily restricts purchases to some extent. The present high price of wool no doubt induces a little speculation, but the legitimate demand for cloth is so great that there can be no doubt the trade generally is in a sound and healthy state.
Jn wool purchases are only made to meet immediate requirements, and holders are not anxious to selL. At this perod of the year there is frequently a good deal of wool On band, bnt the quantity at the present time is scarcely one half what is usuaL.
HALIFAX, FEB. 7.
Tlhe trade of this town continues firm. Merchants, believing that the raw material wiU not be reduced in value for some time, have purchased more freely during the week and at prices which a short time ago they refused to give. In yarns there is not much doing, but as spring approaches this branch will improve. Wool is supported in price, but there is not much business. To-day the market has preseated a rather quiet tone, althoughthere is no alteration in pricesa
NORWICH, FisB. 7.
The statements made respecting the condition of the manufacturing trade continue favourable, and it is certain that employment is more abundant than it has been for some time.
The shoe trade is also active, but this department of indn-ty has been subject of late to an extraordinary increase in the price Of the raw material (from 73 tO 200 per cent.), and the parties concerned complain loudly in consequence.
The Beccles Silkworks Company, established under the Limited Liabllity Act, expect to commence operatiors in
te course of a few weeks.

The amount paid inrespect of Great Western,Oxford Junetion, Berks and Hants, Windsor, and other lines completed, locomotive stock, and so forth, was 10,786,9581. The amount expended on railways opened from Oxford to Wolverhampton nd Dudley was] 6,682,8261.; on the Uxbridgo, opened on the 8th of September last, 75,759L; on the Didcot deviation line, engine-house, and sidings, 38,7491.; on narrow. gauge lines laid down from Oxford to Basingstoke,132,15;.;* on the Western fork line at Beading, 25,379;. * on bridges in lieu of level crossings, 9,291L ; and on Acton junction line, 2,7401. The expenditure on the Wilts, Somerset, and Weymouth, including 17,727i intereot on portion of lino unopened, amounted to 1,46,5421. The expenditure on the Henley branch, in course of construction, including 814l. for interest, amounted to 40,6691. The subscriptions and disbursements for other undertakings amounted to 2,140,0671 This amount includes 581,0001. ordinary and 126,2801. preference stock of the South Wales Railway, 225,000L in South Devon stock, 59,966 Paddington Hotel, 21,6701. additional houses at Swindon, 26,775t. on Gloce5ter and Dean Forest shares and 96,801?. on G. and D.

North Metropolitan Railway Of the 310,000L voted by the proprietors for new rolling stock, 790,5291. had been expended; of this 620,000l. so voted for tho new station at Paddington, 603,8254 had beer expended; and of 130,000?. voted for Bull's-bridge and other new station accommodation 74,4971. had been expended, making the total expenditure on capital account as above 22,876,9601., of which 360,082. was expended during the balf-year.
The capital account of the Shrewsbury lines shows that 3,404,675L hxd been received, including 40,4801. personal accounts due by the company; and 3,372,6251. expended including 22,6011. expended during the half-year for additional siduings and roing stock leaving 32 1434 in assets and personal accounts due to the company. The revenue account of the Shrewsbury lines showed that 131,3861. had been received during the half-year, less 5,275L deducted for pasing over Birkenhead line (126,1111.), and 71, 962L expcended; leaving a balance of 54,1491. to meet 20,0301. the interest on debentures, and 40,987i the dividend on guaranteed stock and preference shares, together 69,01Sl., leaving a deficiency of 14,868., which is charged in the Great Western revenue account.
The revenue account of the Great Western lines for the half-year ending the 31st of December last shows that 795.3531. had been received, including 7,0501. for rents. &a., 10,7704 for use of plant by other companies, 3,327L interest on cash balances of revenue acconnt, 4,7194 rent of Great Western Hotel and otber property.

Government duty on passengers, 14,388l rates and taxes, 3,5001. Parliamentary and legal expenses, and 5391. stamps for debentures, amounted to 309,350l., or 40-214 per cent. of the receipts, against 41-743 per cent. at tho correspondinv period of 185, leavirg a balance for the half-year of 486,002?. To this sum is addea a balance of 9,3401. from tho preceding account, 3,2031. revenue of Kennet and Avon Canal for the half-year, and 14,4141. received in dividends on shares held in the South Devon, South Wales, and Glocester and Dean Forest Railways, making together 512,961L From this sum must bo deducted 2371. for additions to works ; 16,4824 for guaranteed annuities to Wilts, Somerset, and Weymouth proprietors; and 3,6S61. to Kennet and ATon Canal proprietors; 16,935L for half-year's rent-charges on Glocesier and Dean Forest, Hereford, Ross, and Glocester, and Wycombe Railways, and on the Paddington estate; 8,08U for loss on lcase of Soath WalesRailway, including 3333M forlast halfyear, and 311,7951 for interest on loans and preference shares (exclusive of 22,0531. charged to capital), and 14,8683
balance of revenue of Shrewsbury lines for the half-year, making together a charge of 372,1331, and leaving a disposable balance of 140,8224 Oat of this sam the directors propose a dividend at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum on ,26,2761. ordinary stock, which will absorb 123,544l., and leave a balance of 17,2783 for the next account.
Notwithstanding the obstructions to the northern traffic of the Great Western Railway the receipts for the halfyear ending the 31st of Decemberlast amounted to 795,353l., against 734,753?. at the corresponding period of 1855 showirg an increase of 60,6001. The working expenses of the past half-year amounted to 309,3504, against 296,2461 at the corresponding period of 1855, showing an increase of only 13,104. in the expenses, or about 21 per cent, on the increased trafftc, and in the net receipts of 47,496a. or 79 per cent. of the increased traffic. This will be satisfactory, particularly when it is considered that the working expenses on the Great Western are now probably less than on any other Egeat railway in England. The traffic on the Shrewsury lines has progressed in spite of various obstructions and expenses to which it is subject. The gross traffic on the Shrewabury lines for the half-year ending the 31st of Decernber last amounted to 131,3863, and for the correspondir.g period of 1855 to 114,1951, showing an increase of 17,191l., or 15 per cent. The working expenses amounted to 71,9621, and for the corresponding period of 1855 to 76,5964, showing a decrease of 4,6341, which together with the increased receipts made an improvement as compared with the corresponding period of 1855 of 21,825l
in the net receipts oa those lines. But from this sum must be deducted 5,2751. to cover the expenditure in respect of obtaining traffic at Birkenhead, and conveying it over the Birkenhead line, and 3,942 for interest on additional capital required to provide more working stock, sidings, &c., for the increased traffic, leaving 14,8683. to be provided by the Great Western, instead of 17,7261. at the correspondin
period. Were it not for the additional charge at Birkenhead in consequence of an award, the sum to be provided would only have been 9,5931., instead of 14,863? On the wholo it would appear that the increase in the gross revenue of the Great Western and Shrewsbury lines amounts to 77,7911., and in the net revenue to 64,0461. as compared with the corresponding period of 1855. Another important feature in the accounts is that interest and dividend is paid upon the whole of the capital expended, with the exception of 22,0531. charged against capital in respect of sums expended on works in course of construction, the greater portion of which are now completed. The expenditure of capital during the year 1856 amounted to 792 5311., imcluding 350,0821., during the past half-year, and when it is considered that 21 miles to Uxbridge, 201 miles from Warminster to Salisbury, and 26 miles from Frome to Yeovil, together 49 miles, were opened in 1856, and since the commencement of the present year 28 miles from Yeovil to Weymouth, and 10 miles from Bath to Trowbridge were opened, making 87 miles openod for traffic in the course of 13 months, and that there only remain tho Devizes branch, 8& miles, and the Henley branch, 91 miles, to complete in the course of a few months, the great expenditure on capital sccount must now be rapidly drawing to a close. Tho resources of the company, the ability of the executive, and complete organization of tho staff, are shown in the result of an increased traffic and reduced worldng expenditure; and, although the preference chargesforinterest of loans and preference stock amounted to 311,7981. for the past half-year, being 36,655L more than at the corresponding period of 1850, the directors are enabled to doclare a dividend at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum, leavin a balanco of 17,2781., against one declarod a e ra of 24 per cent. per annum, leavingl6,1604 over, at the corresponding period of 1855. A continuance of similar results on revenue account must, under tho circumstances, not only in the course of a comparatively short time overtake all preference charges on capital account, but tend greatly to increase the dindend on the ordinary shares of the company.

NORTH-EASTERN.
The half-year's accounts of this company have just been made up. The half-yearly meeting will be held at York on
the 20thminst., and it ss proposed to declaro a dividend at the rate of 4j4 per- cent, on the Bervnck stock, and of 32 per cent, on the York and North Midland stock, besides paying off adl arrears on the Leeds stock; but for this a divdend of 1 per cent, would have been declared on the
original shares in the Leeds stock, and it is anticipated`that next half-year the directors will be able to declaro a dividend of 1i on these shares. The directors have also come into possession of the estate of Mr. Hudson, MLP., at Whitby, and contemplate making great improvements in that town.
NORTH YORKSHIRE AND CLEVEL:D.
A sortion of this line,from the PictonJunctiontoStokesley, was inspected last week by the Government officer, and his certificate is expected in a fewr days, when the line will bo

MIID-KENT.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held on Saturday, at the office5, Gresham-house, Old Broad-street; Sir J. W. Lubbock, Bart., in the chair.
The report stated that the line was opened for public traffic on the Ist of January, and that the receipts for- the short time which has elapsed since the opening are satisfac-
tory. The lineis workeod by the South-Eastern Compoany, under the agreement at 40 per cent, of the gross receipts for thofirst two years, during which the contractors aro to maintain the line - and at 50 per cent, afterwards, whenthe miaintenaino) will in borne by tho South Eastern Company'
The directors congratate the proprietors uporL the completion of the works in so short a time from their commencement, and state that the cost wll but slightly exceed tbe original estimate, and will be much within the capital authorized to be raised.
The directors intend to apply for powers to extend the line
,to Croydon. The boird are' ouIiibee that thi exliii!da Vli be of psatimpDrtanoe to the Mid lgnt Rail#ay, nd add materally to the valuo of the present property. oire than threc-fourths of the capital is ilready. taken up, and the directors arc promised vAluable support in Parliament from the townund nghbourltoolof Croydon. Xr. Fowler, -the engieer, sataed in his report that the railwUy was opened as a double line and -that the works had been finishea in a subst,ntia manmer. The eapitsl acconat showed that 77,1231. had been received, includin a la
from the banker of 6,000T,, and 68,4091. Xpended, leaving a balance in hand at the banker's of 8,7141.
On the motion of the CH[AIRMA, the report was adopted.
A long discussion ensued oni the proposal to re-elect Mr. Cator, one of the retiring directors, on the ground that he waw opposedl to the Croydon eXtension - and it was proposed, as ass amendment, that Mr. Sutherfand should be appointed in his place.
Mr. W1Lxu6so, XLP., explained that several of the directors were opposed to the Croydon extension in the firt instance; but, in reply to a circular sent to the shse'holdem on the subject, it was found that six to one were in favour of that extension; the directors were terefora bound to carry out the wishes of the shareholders,
hr. BRocmVA.,g considered it a most indiscrnet roect
they wpuld have the opposition of the Brighton and Soathastern compahies; but he hd no doubt it would be a profitable undertaking for the lawyers, engineers, contractors, and landowners, and an expensive one for the shareholder. Mr. CgOp explained that, although he believed the extension would form a valuable adjunct to their line he o- *jected to the proposed cost of it. The estimated' cajtal had been gradually increased from 70,0001. to 96,001.
Mr. L. SsirrsoN stated that the increased cost was for the purpose of securing an independent terminus at Croydon, an other advantages.
On a show of hands, the decision was in favour of Mr. Cator, but apoll ras demanded, and the result was in favour of Mr. Sutherland, who waselected a director. Resolutions were then passed re-electing 3Ir. Simpson a director and Yr. Chritan an auditor, voting 300l. a-year to the secretary and 3001:. aqyear to the directors from the passing of the
Mr. W1Lcmnlsov thought the extension to Croydon a good speculation, because the Croydon line had cost a million of morpey, and they could takeo a share of the tramoc by meanEs of 4. miles of extension at a cost of only 100,000b.
The proceedings concluded withl a ote of thanks to the Chairman.
SIT'TINGBOURNE AND SHEERNESS.
The first half-yearly meeting of this company was held on Thursday at Qaeenborough.
T'he report stated that the works had been commenced, and were in the hands of an eminent contractor. The directors proposed to pay interest on future calls at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum during the construction of tho works, and they state that the mode of forming the janction wit4 the East Kent line had been greed upon. The balance. aheet is rather complicated. It shows a total on both sides of S6,3911., but, on examination, itsppears that 19,0091. of that sum represents deposits and calla in arrear, or otherwise not paid, and 2,o811. owing by the company. These two items appear on each side of the account, and consequently swell the totals to the extent of 21,5901. beyond the proper amount. The sum received on the 8,000 shares is stated to be 12,9911., an caUs in advance 1,8001., and 101. in cash (in suspense account); together, 14,801L From this *hould be deducted the 8,161U, stated as paid for law, englneering, works, and furniture, and 6,000t. deposited in the Court ofChancery, which would leave the balance of 6401. as stated in the acount, including 121. in the hands of the secretary.
Mr. Birkinshaw, the engineer, states in his report that he believes that the original capital of the company will bo fully adequate to carry out the entire undertaking including branches to QCueenborough Point and Her Majesty's dockyard at Sheerness.
GLOCESTER AND DEAN FOREST.
Tho half-yearly meeting of this company was held on Saturday at Glooester, Mr. Baker in the chair.
The accounts showed the receipts on capital account to have been 279,0001 and the payments 278,9001., leaving a balance of 1001. in hand. The income for the half-year, including rent from the Great Western Company, amounted to 6,634a, and, after paying sundrT expenses, a balance of 6,0761. applicable to ividend remamned.
The report of the directors stated that the above balance would be equal to the payment of a dividend of lIls. Sd. per share, leaving a balance of 1481. This company had subscribed 25,0001. to the share capital of the Hereford, toss
and Glocester line, and no dividend havin been paid by that company in the half-yearending the 30th of June last caused the present dividend of this company to be smaller than in the previous half-year. From a variety of causes the cost of the Hereford line and extra works had exceeded the subscribed and debenture capitllbyseveralthousand pounds,and as the onlymeans of meetingthis deficiency without going to Parliament for additional preferenco stock, the directors had assigned the whole of their surplus income to the discharge of the debt. The directors of the Glocester and Dean Forest Company hoped that ultimately no loss would be sustained by this company on the subscription to that undertakng.
The CHAmbrays moved the adoption of the report, which, after a short discussion, was carrid.
A dividend at the rate of lls. 8d. per share, free of incometax, was declared, and the meeting broke up.
WHrITEHAVEN, CLEIATOR, AND EGRBEIONT.
The half-yearly accounts of this railway to the 31st of December last shows that 49,4861 had been received on shares, 15,3001. on loans, and 5031. as interest, &c., macing the total receipts on capital aceount 65,2891. The expenditure amounted to 76,2941., of which 14,2341. had been incnrred during the past six months. The company have apphed to Parliament for power to raise a further sum of 25,000L to enable them to pay off existing liabilities and improve the lino. The revenue account for the past halfyear showed that 4,8041. had been received, and 2,6131. expended, including interest on loans, leaving a balance of 2,1911. This would enable the shareholders to declare'
dividend for the half-year at the rate of nearly 9 per cent, rer annum.

The Cape Mails.-Dartmouth, Feb. 6.-
THE CAPE MAns.-DAuT.iouTu, Feb. 6.- The mail steamship :Harb-nger, Captain Steward, left this port this day at the appointed time, conveying the usnal monthly mails to the Cape of Good Hope and Mauritius. She takes out a full cargo and 40 passengers. This ship coaled, shipped necessary stores and live stock embarked her mails and passengor., and proceeded on her voyage w.thin six hours.
LEXGA CIuzrLTY.-We have received the following letter, showing that a child of nine years old has been committed to the county gaol for ten days for throving stones in the town of Torquay. The editor visited the gaol on Thursday morning, but the rules of the prison did not permit him to see the infant prisoner. The humane and kindhearted governor told, him that thechildwasswell-behavedand an object of sympathy with tho5e who had charge of him; that he was infantineoin appearance, dressed in a tunic with a b>elt, with habits befittmg his ago, and nothing like a ciminal or Dl-behaved child. We saw vthe warrant under which he was brought to gaoL It states that he was fined Is. 6d., and 3s. 6d. costs, and that, thefather stating that he had no goods on WEhich the funds might be levied, theBench committed the child for ten days' imprisonment in the county gaoL This is a horridly abswrd sentence on the face of it. We do not, however, mean to impeach the conduct of the magistrates, as we do not know the facts of the case They may bo bound by the local act of Parliament ; but, if so we would impeach the law, Whenstandingunder the C7clo6 pean arch of the gaol and vierin its raed massiveness, 'we could not help feeling a cold sudderat the thought that a poor child was snatched from his playmates in the street and consigned to a stern imprisonment for an offence whicfh might have deserved a parental birching, but nothing more. Wvith the exception of the discrepanoy as to the fine, we believe the father's story is substantially correct. We may eehat itwillhve vcostto add this poor child asan item in the "increased criminal" returns. The cost of apprI hension, of conveyance to Exeter, of maintenance in gaol, of return fare to Torquay, all come out of the county-rate and the consolidated fund. There is one consoLation in the case. The child is tenderly cared for in prison by the excellent governor, whotold us that hcould nothelp lookin
at him as a father, having children ofithe samue ano; and,i,f he had only ho receivo the children wiho might be caught throwing stones, the veryprecinets of the gaol would suppnl7 enough tofdilit. The following letter is from the child<s father:-

LONDON, AIONDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1857.
Thirteen years have passed since the last great battle on the currency. It was fought with mucha spirit and with a very decided result, for metal prevailed over paper, and securities were extorted from the treacherous foe for its actual as well as its legal subordination. Not content with the mere principle that a note should always be changeable into so much gold, the champions of a metallic currency now confined the risk of insolvency within a very safe compass. The Bank of England had gone on for a quarter of a century using its own discretion on this delicate matter, and had always had gold enough in its coffers. But there were those who feared, or hoped, that it might some day be found wanting. So the act of '1844 limited this discretion, and compelled that after a certain point every note should have its due weight of bullion in the Bank. Terms so rigid and so material are more like the hard securities we exact from a barbaric foe than the provisions of a European treaty, and they have been resisted accordingly by the partisans of paper. It is impossible to say how many men have gone xmad upon figures in consequence; how many reams of calculations, prophecies, and Jeremiads have been published or spoken, or what mountains of abuse have been heaped on all persons concerned in the acts of 1819 and 1844. Accordingly, we did expect that when, after 13 eventful years, the antagonists met once more on this old arena we should have some hard fighting. " When Greek meets Greek then comes "the tug of war." The lovers of sport, however, have not been thus gratified. A certain degree of diffidence has been shown on both sides. Gcvernment has sent the whole question upstairs, with a very plain intimation that it sees no reason to make any change of importance; and half-a-dozen gentlemen who have been before the world ever so long as impugners of the existing legislation have just whispered their misgiving that it has not completely answered its purpose, regretted that Government appeared to have made up its mind, offered one or two hazy suggestions, and sat down. We had expected more of them. No doubt, it was in the expectation that they had something to say for themselves that Government relegated the subject to the upper regions ; otherwise, for aught that appears, there was no reason why a bill should not have been brought in on the spot and passed in a fortnight. We shall now have another blue-book of a thousand pages, in two volumes perhaps, entombing a confused mass of figures, theories, and schemes, proving anything or nothing, and, haply, not read by ten members of the House.
Only one gentleman of antediluvian politics ventured to attaclk the act of 1S19. We havegot beyond that. There is not one rational dissentient from the doctrine, or rather the moral obligation, of a convertible paper currency. It is the act of 1844 that is in question. But, though this act naturally wears a complex and to some extent an artificial character, yet it immediately resolves itself, as we have several times been at the pains to show,into several things perfectly distinct, and each sosimplethata child can understand it. We may take them one by one, and ask wlich of them is objected to, and what is the objection. In the first place, there is the paper currency, which, besides that it economizes gold, is a matter of obvious convenience, notes being more poltable and more disposable than gold. Government might take this matter into its own bands. It might issue "M 3int " notes." Nobody, however, proposes that it should, except that, as Mr. GLYN'S suggestion would reduce the ismue of notes to a fixed formula, in that case it might be done as 'well by the officeis of the Mint as by a board of mercanuile gentlemen. But nobody objects to any precaution that may be thought' necessary for secufring that under all prob.ible circumstances 'Ie be6r of a nte Mliay have gold for it on'the spotj iad the psper may be<as good as gold. The 14,000,0001. of paper not represented by gold
Vas 'tkeh AinMply beCiise it was fo3ind in fact that the people of England never held less than that quantity of notes in circulation, and it would be a waste, of money to provide for a payment that was never required. As to the, necessity, then, of a xu£1icient security for the conversion of the note, and the unnecessarine6ssbf a more than sufficient security, it may be said that all are agreed. Again, not a word was said the other night against the Bank of England having the managernent of the National Debt, it being, in fact, a matter of the most ordinary convenience. Further, very little was said about the country banks, and the provisions of the act of 1844 for substituting Bank of England notes for their circulation. Theobjections, such as they are, are almost exclusively ai3ued at the Bank of England as a bank employing at its own discretion the money intrusted to it, and the balances arising from the performance of the above functions. The objection is substantially to the Bank of England as the largest bank, with the most capital, and consequently the most power. Every objection made by Mr. MuarNs, Mr. GLY2m, or anybody else, is applicable in only a less degree to every other bank, excepting that stress is laid, rather unduly, as it seems to us, on the moral effect of a large weekly return.
We do not see how it is possible to obviate the objection of a great bank, with large and fluctuating balances, with much power, and with an almost absolute discretion. If Government commits the issue of bank-notes, the management of the revenue, and other financial operations to bankers at all out of WVhitehall, it ought to deal with one bank, and that bank the largest; and the larger, in reason, the better, because the more responsible. All the interference which it is, then, wise, or even just, for Government to attempt must be to secure the responsibility of the Bank. Any further attempt to limit its resources or fetter its discretion is simply ridiculous. As far as we can understand Mr. GLyr, he objects that under I the act of 1844 the Bank of England has sometimes
bad too much money in its coffers; it has been too trustworthy; it has inspired too much confidence; and in its very natural desire to IIse its accumulations it has parted with them too freely, at too low a rate of interest. We do not profess to -understand the plan by which Mr. GLYN would provide that the Bank should not have so much money, and should never lend on such ea sy terms, but it seems to us aimed against the very existence of the Bank as such. & bank may be very imprudent. It may be worse. It may use its power, as other capitalists have done, to crush competitors. It may draw people into speculations from which they cannot recede, but for which they will want further assistance, on whatever terms the Bank may then impose. All this has been asserted a thousand times, and is still aserted, of all banks, aU bill-brokers, and all money-lenders; and no doubt the Bank of England, as the largest bank in the world, can commit more enormities or follies of this kind than any other. Only one offence, however, was alleged on Friday night, and that was that the Bank of England did not raise its rate of interest early enough to avert or mitigate the disaster of 1847. That is now ten years ago. Has the Bank during that period been guilty of any flagrant neglect or wilful abuse of its power? But, even if it has not been uniformly judicious in its operations, what of that? It is a bank; Government must deal with a bank, which must be a large one, and have a large discretion.
There must frequently recur times when a man of ordinary foresight will expect to find his money much more valuable by-and-bye than it now is. It is not a time to invest when speculation flags, and when funds and shares are high. In this country there is a large class of wealthy men with their eyesonthefluctuations of enterprise and credit. They will keeptheir moneysomewhere or other, safe, free, and accessible. They will keep it in a bank, and they wil be apt to select the Bank of England. At least, the deposits so made will practically converge in the Bank of England through the medium of other banks. This is a practice which is spontaneous, independent of legislation, and only tak-ing its accidental form from the institutions of the day. In such a state of things as Mr. GLYN alludes to somebody or other, some banks, or some capitalists, would have twenty millions lying comparatively idle, waitiDg for an opportunity. That the money should be accumulated in the Bank of England is an accident of no great importance, for somewhere it must be, and it may as well be there. Wherever it is, the ;nowledge of its existence-for known it must bewould tell on the commerce of the country. Its owners under any circumstances will lend their money at a low interest rather than suffer it to ie quite idle. An abundance of money lent on easy terms will always foster speculation, which in its turn will always create a demand for money, and place the borrower at the mercy of the lender, or rather compel the latter to protect himself, and make the best of his advantage. But when such fluctuations always have been in this country, and to a much greater extent in other countries, and when the only difference between England and the United States in this respect is that the interest of money has been almost invariably lower here than there, no case can be established against the Bank of England or the act of 1844 as the cause of such fluctuations. They have been aggravated since 1844 by the discovery of the goldfields and such arrivals of the precious metals as would have been incredible a few years ago. But England must always be liable to them so long as she requires every year immense and increasing quantities of commodities either wholly of foreign production or not sufficiently produced in this country. Our population and manufactures require a certain amount of corn, of cotton, of silk, of tea and sugar, and other articles. No human foresight can say whether, owing to the faiilre of crops here and elsewhere, we maynothave to pay2O,OOO,OOOl. more than usual for a less quantity than usual of these articles next year. In this case we must, in the first instance, make up the deficiency in money, and in order to be able to do so we must
have accumulations of money and credit. There can be no wisdom, then, in expressly legislating in order to prevent accumulation, which in itself is no evil, whatever evils it may lead to. If this is the only specific objection to the act of 1844 the committee will not have much to do, and may save themselves the trouble of adding one more huge unreadable volume to the pile already printed on the subject.

It is not likely that any session of Parliament
It is not likely that any sesion of Parliament 'will pass over for some time to come without a recurrence to the question of popular education. We may even expect the invectives of the reformers on national inertness and national ignorance to be sharper every year, for the moro clearly men see the advantages of extended instruction the more likely they are to be impatient with all who do not fully agree with them and earnestly, help them. There is probably more said about ihe ignorance of the poorer classes and the duties of the more favoured -than at any previous time; but it does not follow that the country is in the same, state as in the days when Mr. BRouGuAr frst called attention to the fact that only one adult out of 17 could read and write. There has been no want of energy, self-sacrifice, and well-directed philanthropy in
the lifetime of the present generation, and t'e fa'e that there 'are always men so eager and eanriest that they think nothing done while ought remains to do is no evidence against the real progress which has been made in dealing with the ills which affect a long-neglected society. However, the educationists, who are discontented with the present system, are not disposed to fall into inactivity. The deficiencies of the scheme of voluntary or self-supporting instruction are lHikely to be exposed during the present session with all the usual -keenness of criticism; and, indeed, the State educationists have something to say for their own views, or at least can plausibly compare their ideal organization with the actual working of the unsymmetrical, untheoretical, struggling system which doleS out a modicum of instruction to the children of our vast towns or our scattered, secluded hamlets.
3Ianchester of course, as the metropolis of the educational reformers, has its meeting as a prelude to the Parliamentary campaign. The General Comnuittee of Education in DManchester and Salford unites the adherence of Sir J3=S KAY Snu=rEwoiTH, Sir JoRw PAxINTON, and Mr. COBDEFN. It may therefore be said to take a position apart from any poLtical party, and to base its doctrines solely on the principles of a local rating for education and the communication of instruction independent of definite religious teaching. The latter part of the system, however, is not so much dwelt upon, the great object of the reformers being to induce the Legislature to force each locality to provide by selftaxation for the education of the children within its limits. Sir J. SEUTTrLwoRTH acknowledges how much has been effecteA by the voluntary system, for which the House of Commons last year showed so dedded a predilection. By the last census 2,000,000 children were receiving some kind of education. There are now 4,000 certificated teachers and 10,300 pupil teachers. The education grant for the present year will amount to 540,0001., and, in the speaker's opinion, will, at the present rate of increase, amount to 1,000,00O0. sterling withinthreeyears' time. Such a sum, he thinks, ought not be paid by the nation and adniinistered by the Governnment without the intervention of local boards. But whatever be the faults of the system there can be no doubt of the magnitude of the amount voted and of the benefit conferred on the nation. It may be true that there are 4,000,000 children between the ages of 3 and 15 years, and that only half of this number receive instruction. But the fact that half the children within the possible years of instruction were actually at school on one given day, and that consequently the far larger part of them must at some time or other receive the elements of education, gives proof of the system having merits which should cause it not to be lightly abandoned.
Sir J. PAKINGTON urges strongly the necessity of State interference. He says that the present practice is precarious, fitful, and not to be depended upon. Now, undoubtedly voluntary contributions and personal exertions seem at first sight means which the politician who legislates for vast masses of people and for long terms of years may naturally distrust. But it is proved by experience that in our country this principle of individual generosity and individual exertion is the most fruitfu and the most abiding. It sustains great sects which rival the Church in power at home and missionary enterprise abroad. It supports hospitals which minister to the wants of the largest towns, charities which relieve distress in every form; it provides a home for the orphans of our soldiers and seamen; it relieves a vast mass of temporary poverty which shrinks from the degradation of the workhouse. Its existence is one of the great characteristics of the English people. No tale of heroism, or injustice, or suffering can be told throughout this land without evoking from hundreds proofs of sympathy. Such a system apolitician may safely trust. It may not do everything that could be wished; it may not supply the place of a perfect State organization, but it maybe safely confidedin, because it is founded onthe habits of the people themselves, and is not likely to be overthrown by weariness or discontent. The Legislature has therefore, we think wisely, decided that the voluntary principle shall be preserved as the basis of our national system of education, and that all that the State does shall be built on this foundation. If Sir J. PAxRIGTox and his friends are wiling to adopt this principle, they wil no doubt meet with success in their endeavours to extend the sphere of Government assistance; but if they seek to overthrow what has been already adopted, they will but mar the working of the present system, without any chance of substituting the scheme which they favour.
How far, then, is the present system successful? What aid fiom the State does it require, and 'here is the interference of Government desirable? It succeeds, we think-, wherever there is any desire and any means to support schools. Wherever the population is not too crowded, wherever there is a resident gentry, or a class sufficiently endowed with wealth, the children of the district get an education with which the country has reason to be satisfied. But it cannot be denied that there are places in which no such assistance can be reckoned upon. The squire, the clergyman, or the liberal-minded manufacturer who will sacrifice time or money for the instruction of his neighbours is not to be found in every district. Even in agricultural counties there are parishes'where there is no one of superior station or inteUigence to the farmers, and here the atandard and extent of education are grievously unsatisfactory. The same thing may be said of those manufacturing towns where the masters reside at a distance and whole parishes are entirely inhabited by factory operatives. In such places, no doubt, some such influence as the Government might exert would be advantageous for the dissemination of knowledge; but it seems plain that in these very places the proposed local rate would be a failure. There would be no rate for schools for the same reason that there are no schools actually existing,simply because the imposition of rates would rest with the inhabitants, and those who care nothing for education now would be equaUy neglectful under another system. It must be remembered.
also, that in more favoured districts such an impost would be a discouragement to the benevolent, who would be taxed equally with those who pay nothing but what the ratecollector demands. For the greater part of the country we think, therefore, that the present system should be allowed to work and produce its own results. It is no disgrace, however, to an institution that it is not universally applicable, and the voluntary system can hardly be left unaided in localities which it is too clear are unable or unwilling to originate anything for themselves.

There is one piece of advice which we must give
There is one piece of advice which we must give Convocation, and that is, that it must economize its time better. We have to give this advice occasionally to another legislative body. But Parliament, however wasteful it may be of this. precions article, has, at any rate, the advantage of having half the year to spend, to tllat it can afford a little prodigality and indulgence. Convocation has only three days. This is short allowance, but, as it is all which that body is likely to have for some time,
that is the more reason why it should be jealouslyi husbanded and carefully expended. Convocation misaybe said to be 4nitstrial now. Ithas three days a-year given it on which to shor itself inteligent,
41i34sie fi64iral P lintercoted, impassionitej
cious, large-minide4, au& -p&ie..ti AU these and many other virtues must beoexhibited in thc space of three days. This i the ordeal which eonvoCP tion must successfully undergo, if it is ever to be anything moYre than it is at present. It nust be confessed it is nOt an easy one. The rmost exper.encod traveller cannot squeeze everything intohis smal carpetbag, infinite as its elasticity may seem; and Lord BurnLEIGII's nod could not express all the statesmanlike virtues in existence. There is a limit to -concentration; even the essences of things demand a little room, and are not comfortable in an absolute point or corner. But they are obliged often reluctantly to acqpiesee in a very little space. What large and mighty energies does the little bottle on the chymist's table hold in chains I-
" Luctantes ventos tempostatesquo sonoras " Imperio premit."1
A power that, if suffered to escape, would destroy half a street, half a town, or half the world, submits quietly to the imprisonmnent of a glass of the circumiference of your finger, and the genius which has risen and risen till his head is lost in the clouds lowers his height inch by inch, till at last he crouches under the lid of the copper kettle. The small phial, then, to which ConvoCation is at present reduced need not produce despair; there is room for existence, if not for freedom and play. Why should we not hate the "essence of Synods," and " spirit of 4onvoca"tion I' If thespace allowed to the action of this body is, however, thus nanrow and contracted, there is tenfold reason why it should be economized, and Convocation would be none the worse for a little more sense of the importance of time, and the necessity of not wasting the smalUest fraction of its very short term of existence.
We say this because it is quite evident that Convocation has been wasting-simply wastil g- a great deal of its time this session. Why must it be continually engaged in ingenious suggestions for the formation of a new court of final appeal ? There can be no doubt that this is a very fair subject for its consideration, and that Convocation is quite competent to make suggestions for the improvement of this Court, which few people, perhaps, think quite permect. But Convocation has now time after time been debating on this point, and last session it formally took up the question, examined it, and came toa conclusion. Acommittee of theLowerHousewas appointed, and a report was drawn up embodying the judgment of the Lower House upon this subject, so far as any detenninate judgment could be formed. What more, then, was there for the Luwer House to do upon it ? Yet, as if the question had been hardly broached, the present session of Convocation commences with a fresh debate upon it. A new scheme for a court of final appeal is proposed, amendments are proposed upon it, one plan elicits another plan, and of the three days allowed to Convocation nearly two are occupied in discussing a subject which appeared to have been finally disposed of a year ago. After all-and it was the only piece of wisdom in the whole business-the House determined that nothing more could be arrived at in the way of conclusion inan was arrived at before, and fell back upon the report of last year. With respect to the plans themselves, Convocation has itself taken the trouble of comment off our hands by rejecting them. That is the best and shortest comment. What we observe now is generally the danger in a body like Convocation of wasting time in plans and schemes of this kind. There is nothing so pleasant and so easy as planning, and nothing so catching. How is the knotty difficulty to be solved ? By -what neat arrangement can we make the ecclesiastical and the civil estateg exactly meet each other half way? How are we to compose our court of appeal? Lawyers and bishops compose it according to one plan; theological professors come in according to another plan; a third plan makes it, instead of one court, two separate courts. Then there are the rival claims of the episcopacy and the presbytery to be settled, one plan favouring the one, and another the other. " Let the bishops form a " court by themselves," says one schemer, " to " assist the Privy Council" ; " No," says another, "The court ought to represent Convocation, the "Lower House as well as the Upper." Certainly some of these plans are marvellous specimensof constructive power. WVhat are we to say, for example, of a scheme of two separate courts in doctrinal cases, one composed of the bishops, the other of members of the Judicial Comnmittee, each cour't having to examine the case fully and completely, with the ansistance of cotunsel, just as if the other did not exist, and the conclusion being that the episcopal court is to send its report to the lay court, " which should, after "consideration of such opinion, proceed to such "final determination of the cause as it may think "proper?" The proposer of this scheme doubtless meant it as a support to the episcopacy ; but, were the most iDgenious mind to set to work to construct a plan by which the episcopacy -was to be made to look as small as possible, and the greatest prominence to be given to its subdination to lay supremacy, it could hardly perhaps strike out a more effective plan for such a purpose than this. Here is a court of bishops set to work to investigate a case of doctrine; after a full hearing they have to report upon it, and the report, after it has been sent up, is to have exactly this weight,-that if it coincides with the judgment of the lawyers it will be adopted, and if it does not it will be thrown aside. But, without entering into the merits of particular schemes, it is obvious that this whole subject, having been fully discussed in Convocation last year, ought not to have been reintroduced, and that it was wasting this body's very short term of annual existence to occupy half of it with paper plans for a final court of appeal. If the Lower House of Convocation has forgotten this year the conclusion to which it came on this subject last year, and has, after a day and a halfs debate, simply arrived at the tame conclusion again, it may forget next year the debates and the conclusions of both years. We shalI see it
setting to work quite fresh next session at its favourite subject, as if nothing had been done in either of the two sessions preceding, going like a rockinghorse over the same ground, and coming annually to the same point, like the unconscious traveller who saw the marks of horseshoes continually increasing on the road, which was simply taking him round and round.
We do not make these remarks from any feeling hostile to Convocation. We see no reason why it should not be a more or less useful and effective body ; but those are its best friends who show it its dangers and caution it against mistakes. There are many practical questions in which Convocation might make itself a serviceable adviser to Parliament on rmatters connected with the Church. There are many parts of the internal machinery of the Church which require modification, antwhich, can only by the law of the land receivZ this modification through the medium of Convocation. Such,e for example, is the present rigid rule respecting the public services of the Church, the relaxation of whicil occupied the attention of Convocation some time'ago,butw1hichhaslately dropped out of mind. What Convocation wants is tomue constant supply of good material for discuis4 tion. It ought never to be allowed to repeat itself idly, as it is doiing now; sonic fresh practical ques.
blon ought to be al*ays put before it. The good hieas in the tsse%bly ought to provide out of the cimuhatances.anl wants of the Church a succeslion of these questions, and to feed the mnhune,

Mr. ROUNDELL PALMER on Thursday evening pre-
M1r. RoP D PALBu on Thursday evening pte'sentecI to the House of Commons the petition of -OnO CHAR.LS ATTwOOD, a farm labourer in Essex. 'The case of this poor man-supposing the allegations of the petition to be true-seems hard enough. He is 60 years of age, he has a wife and 11 children, he has rented a cottage for 30 years, aund he has brought up his family without parochial -elief. A reasonably hard task in life is this one jvhich has been imposed upon CHAP.LES ATTWOOD, and-always supposing his statements to be true -he appears to have discharged it in a very cre.eitable manner. He took service at Christmas, 1855, with a master, receiving weekly paymeat, zud remained in this place till August of last year, when he had a dispute with his employer and took .service elsewhere. Hereupon his late master had him taken before a magistrate on a charge of leaving his work, and the magistrate sentenced him :Sunmarily to 21 days' imprisonment in Chelmsford Gaol, with hardlabour. ie vwas treated in the gaol like a common prisoner in all respects, and appears to brive suffered so much that on his discharge he fell ill, and, in consequence of his sickness, lost his 'harvest work. Now, if all this story be true, we trust 1tke old statutes under which such enormities may be ipossible may be repealed in the present session. 'Xhis, however, is not all. CHARLES ArnVOOD has s son; and this son, as it appears, was em2loyed by the Rev. MIr. HEntNIio. Are we -wrong in supposing that this is the very gentletaan who some time back sent a couple of wretched rustics to gaol because they had left their work to see a review of the Essex Yeomanry? CARBLEs -ATTWOOD'S son came to London one Sunday, and, being late for the train on the Sunday evening, las been skulking about London ever since, for fear of the consequences if he returned to Essex. HIe appears not to have been mistaken in his anti'cipations, for the Rev. Mr. HEMMING has got a warrant against him, as M,r. R. PALnMER informed the House on Thursday, and is waiting for him in
sr,ex, ready to devour him whenever he may make his appearance. Essex is certainly not included in -the benefits of theMissouri Compromise. That bucolic -county is a kind of Kansas, from wlhich the Free,oilers have been driven in confusion. What a farce it is in English people to abuse the slave institutions of the United States, while such enor-mities are possible within their own dominions, at -the distance of but a few miles from the seat of legislation ! We would very respectfuRly invoke the attention of the CsAcEwmoR to this fresh trausaction in which the name of the Rev. MIr. HMr315G occupies so prominent a place. Is that rev. gentleman quite the person to remain in the 'commission of the n)eace ?

AUSTRAMIA;
(BY ELEOTRIO TEraGRAPs.)
TheBlackBail packet-ship MlorningLight,Captain Gillies, has arrived with advices from Melbourne to the i4t of November, and 124,000oz. of gold, 3,500 bales oi wool, and a quantity of ore, wc. The Heather Bell sailed for London on the 30th of October, with 81,470oz. of gold.
Mr. l)onaldson, the new Treasurr, had submitted the Mlinisterial budget to the Assemubly. He said that at the end of 1855 the deficit in the revenue was not less than 120,0001., tho accumulation of former deficits. The present Administration intended to raise 150,0001. by terminable annuities.
The prospects of the country were cheering. The estimated iacome was 1,200,0001., and was in excess of the expenditure. The Cutstoms' revenue was in a prosperous condition, a highly favourable change having set in during the last six months.
If the present Ministers remained in power they would early in 1857 address themselves to the con struction of a scheme of taxation that should fall as equitably as possible on property, and not touch labour beyond the present boundary. He urged the necessity of economy in the public service. The. expenditure had hitherto been too large.
The new Legislature had been announced to meet on the 21st of November.
ln order to enter on the event with Sclat there would be a general cessation of business on that day.
The total quantity of gold brought down to Sydney from the goldfields of New South Wales for the week- was 1,602 oz.
Melbourne and its vicinity had been visited by a wind and sand storm surpassing in intensity any which had been experienced in the colony. Considerable damage was occasioned by it.
Mr. Ramsay Hay, formerly in Government em ploy at Melbourne, had committed suicide by taking strychnine.
The store of William Bateman and Co., at Warnambool, had been destroyed by fire.
The goldfields at Fingal, Tasmania, though limited in extent, were profitable. At Bendigo the diggers were doing owell; among them were several hundred Italians. At Chinaman's Flat immense quantities of gold are being got from the washino stuff. The "w wet sinkings " at Donolly were doing welL At Stony-creek there was a great want of water. Five Scotchmen who were worlkng a tunmel at Horley River had been buried alive by the earth falling in. There had been rushes at Tuena diggings, and some parties had done well.
The accounts from the other goldfields present the same cheering features.
From Mackay, Baines, and Co.'s circular we ex. tract the following report of the market:-
T The state of this market is not quite so satisfactory as might be expected in ordinary times at this season of the year. The large arrivals aud the expectation of many more have had a serious influaence ia checking business; stocks are undoubtedly low on the digging,, and considerable orders are in course of execution, but the retailers In town are very chary in increasing their stocks except at low rates. It may be stated as a rule that the stocks of most articles of general consumption are large, and that a remunerative trade is chiefly done in what are called out. side articles. On the part of importers thero is considerable apprehension that the trade here is about to be overdone, and this inddces them to part with articles in demand at the low rates now being offered. The banks havo made during the last half-year consi. derableadvances, which do not correspondingly increase theamounts of circulation and deposits. We have made inquiries, and find that this apparent anomaly is explained by the retumni-ng confidence between the importers and the retailer. Until the beginning of the present year the business since the late crisis had been almost wholly in cash; but within the last few months the credit system has been in a great measure re-established, the banks have discounted more freely, and the remittances to England on account of consignments have correspondingly increased. We have pleasure in stating that the finncial affsirs of the colonists, both public and private, are exceedingly sound, and that at no time was the business transacted by the banks more safe anid satisfactory than at present."
For gold the demand for shipment was active, at 31. 16s. 6d. to 31. 18s. 3d. An advance had taken place in wool; greasy, 101d. ; fleece, Is. 4d. to ls. 8id.; scoured, Is. 71-d. ; lambs, 2s. Oild. per lb. Tallow was readily taken ; for oilmen's stores a better demand existed. Brandy was dull, at reduced prices. For hides there was a good demand for shipment. Large arrivals of soft goods had reduced prices even in the face of a good demand.
There was an active demand for agricultural labourers and masons. The imports from the 1st of January to the 1st of November were 10,874,6201. The exports were 13,104,9841. The receipts of gold by escort for 13 weeks ending the 8th of November were 629,200 oz., against 638,776 oz. in the same period the previous year. The week's receipts were G1,775oz. ; corresponding week in 1855, 53,505oz.
Exchange on London, 30 days, 1 pm.; discounts on bills under 95 days, 7 per cent. ; over that period, 8 per cent.
At Adelaide there were symptoms of returning animation in business. The market was, however, abundantly supplied, anid the turn was in favour of the buyers, with the exception of gin and sugar.
LIVERPOOL, FirE. 8.
From a New York paper of the 24th ult., with which Mr. Court, of the UInderwriters'-rooms, has favoured us, we learn that the steamship James Auger had arrived at New York from San Juan, which place she left on the 13th ult.
The English steamship Trent and six English screw vessels of war-three being gunboats-were at Aspinwall.
WValker was reported to be in a better coudition than ever, and to have 1,200 ablebodied men at Rivas, well supplied with provisions andammunition, while at Pkunta Arenas was a body of nearly 300 men under Colonel Longbridge, who intended to attack the Costa Ricans at CastiUlo and San Carlos, and retake the river, as soon as he had the means of transportation; for this he depended upon a steamer Mr. Scott expected to have in readiness by the 17th ult.

MEETING OF WORKING MEN.-A crowded meet-
VIBEBrNo or WORKiNG MEN.-A crowded meeting of working men was held on Friday evening at the Temperance-ball, Clerkenwell, M:r. Neale Porter In the chair; when several resolutions were agreed to, haying reference to the present distressed condition of the working men of the metropolis. Thefirstresolution called the attentiox of Government to the "severe, wide-spread and alarming distress existing in the metropoUs and its snurbs, the result of a long stagnation in t?e building and other trades." The other resolutions spoke of the " acute and almost intolerable privations" now endurend by working men, their wives and children, and stated that the only hope of the men who could not find emplo ent was emigration to Australia, New Zealand, and Canad,a l; and they therefore pra)ed the Government to grant them a free ssage to the colonies. Petitions to both Houses of Parliament, based upon the resolutions, were agreed to.
DISASTEB AT SEA.-The Nworkerni P;.Tsign, publisbed at Wick, gives an account of the loss of six men in that bay on Saturday week. The Duke of Richmond steamer arrived there about half-past 8 o'clock in the morning, when the weather was calm, and the passen
and a smaU portion of the goods for Wick were landed in safety. A beavy sea, however, subsequently rose. The steamer left for Broadhaven, and two boats with goods, which contained eight men, proceeded towards the steamer tbrough a heavy surf. Of these eight men six perished. Five of them have left widows, who together have 25 children.
RESISTy"CE TO TI1E LrvurooL Town Du.x.-
One of the most important questions in connexdon with the imposition of the Liverpool town dues is the legal right of the corporAtion to exact dues from vessels which, though p3ssing up the river, make no use of the Liverpool Docks. This particularly affects the small port of Garston, aboat four miles up the river, on the Liverpool sdde. There is already a commodious dock, *ith direct railway communication (St. Helen's Railway), and vessels of large burden can bo received there. The question of right to levy dues on vessels trading there and not calling at LAverpool is about, to be tried, Messrs. Fender, of Manchester, having givenu notice to the corporation officials of their intention to despatch a vessel, which bas loaded at Garaton, without paying the town dues. Theyare said to have obtained an indemnity fromthe Garston andSt. Helen'sRailwayCompany and the vessel is to leave the port to.day (Monday). IS the legal struggle which is inevitable result in therecognition of the right of exemption of vessels loading or discbargin aif Gar-ton from the town dues, that port will soon grow into irxiportance, as all Manchester goods will iu future be forwarded that way.

NEW YORIS, JAXA23
The weather 6o0iilnues ezeessrX' cold; a,d everything is resumuing the intensey po;- condition from which we thought we had escaped. With the glass four degrees below zerO even sleighing, at least in the city, is not a pleasure, and for the last twvo daya the brilliancy of +he first dash into it has been departing. It has taken the business-like appearance of a necesity. Thesevere cold has preserved the snow, but following, as it did, a partial thaw on the 22d it has coated everything with ice, and walking, is attended with peril to the limbs, or requires so much caution that it is impossible to move rapidly enough to keep the blood from congelation. The railways have begun to run again, though very irregularly. The first train from Washington since the 18th came in last night, having been four days and nights achieving 240 miles. Travellers who left gay city on a distant journey oa the evening of the severe Sunday (the 18tlh) were everywhere caught, and as they now turn iup at intervals at the points of arrival publish dismal accounts of their sufferings in driffs and cuttings, in which they were snowed up fob 24 hours at a time, depending on forays in the vicinity for food and on the railroad fences for fire. The storm threw al the mercantile machinery of the city out of gear; none of the distant mails for the steamer to Europe of the 21st came in; draughts, bills, and advices were missing; and the telegraphs were hard at work, rsetting the confusion right as well as it could be done. But it would be useless to describe these winter effects at any length; snow, ice, and the thermometer would naturally be leading topics in a correspondence froiM the Arctic regions; but the repetition of such frosty matter soon becomes monotonous.
The Committee of Inquiry into Legislative corruptions at Washington is carrying on the investigation in earnest, and the process is taking the appearance of a conflict of the Legislature with the press. Congress is launched fairly into that most difficult of all quarrels to get well out of-a question of privilege. The House of Representatives, having, at the request of the commnittee, directed the arrest of the correspondent of the Neao YoTh Times, has now ordered him to be k;ept in close custody by the Serjeant-at-Arms. That official has received due notice of an action for false imprisonment, and a writ of h1ab eas corps was to have been applied for yesterday to test the power of the House to keep in custody a prisoner for contempt. The committee insists that the prisoner is bound to provethe charges of corruption bynaming the parties he implicated generally; and he asserts his right to "utter warnings on moral conviction and it is for the House to detect the offenders. The report of the committee on the deadlock in which it found itself by the refusal of the witness to answer its questions is as follows
" That during the progrees of their investigation they had summoned as a witness James W. liaonton, correspondent of the New York Daily Times; that, among others, the lo'. lowing question was pro pounded to him :-' You state that certain mombers have approached you, and have desired to know if tbey could not, through you, procure money for their votes upon certain biLls. Will you state who these members were?' and that the said Simonton made thereto the following response:-' I cannot without violation of confidence, than which I would rather suffer inything.' In response to other questions of similar Import, he said, ' Two members have made them direct, and others have indicated a desire to talk with me upon these subjects, and I have warded them off, not giving them an opportanity to make an explicit proposition.' To the question 'What do I understand you to mean when YOU, say these communications were made direct?' mr. Simonton replied-'I mean that, after having obtained my promise of secreoy in regard to them, they have said to me that certain measures pending before Congress ought to pay, that parties inter ested in them had the meaus to pay, that they individually needed money, and that they desired me to specifically arrange matters in such a wy that if the measures passed they should receive pecuniary compensation.' The committee Were impressed with the materiality of the testimony withheld by the witness, as it embraced the letter and spirit of the inquiry directed by tha House to be made, but were anxious to avoid any controversy with the witness They consequiently waived the interrogatory that day to give the witness time for reilection on the consequences of his refusa, and to afford him an opportunity to look into the law and practice of tho House in such cases, notifying him that he would on some subsequent day be recalled. This was the 16th of January. On Tuesday, the 20th inst., the said
Simonton was recalled, and the identical question first re. I ferred to was again propounded, after due notice to him that if he declined to answer the committee would feel con. strained to report his disinclination to the House, and ask that body to enforce all its powers in the premises to compel a full and complete response."
The witness repeated his refusal and the reasons for it, at the bar of the House in a speech of some length, and was then placed under arrest; thence the gradation into close custody was easy and natural; in reality, however, it is not very close& vue onTy; and now the case is carried before a court of law, in which the House of Representatives will appear as defendants in an action for false imprisonment. These are the troubles that make Farlianientary precedents, and the case may prove even more important than it appears to be.
To meet the difficulty in future cases, and provide against an embarrasing reticence on the part of witness who may be examined hereafter on any subject, the following short bill was introduced:-
"Any peon wilfully refusing to give testimony or to produce papers before any committeo shall be liable to in. dictment for miademeanour, and on conviction pay a fine of not more than $1,000 nor less than $100, and be imprisoned in the Penitentiary not more than one year nor less than one month. No person thus testifYing shall be held to answer before any court of justice for any facts disclosed before the committee of either House."
The bill was not heartily approved, but many members voted for it lest their motive for opposing it should " be misunderstood by their constituents." The ordinary rules were suspended, and it was forthwith agreed to, sent up to the Senate, referred to its judiciary committee, reported back to the House without amendments, and passed finally yesterday. It was " rushed" through. Several members objected to so suddenly enacting a general law on a special case, but the objections were overruled. If any witness now refuse to answer a question he can be indicted for a misdemeanour. There is another witness in custody, who was captured by the Sergeant-at-Arms, having fled at the first alarm; four others who will be called have resolved to defy the committee; in a few days the executive officer of the House is likely to have his hands full.
It is stated this morning from Washington that the arrested witness does not intend to apply for a writ of hibeas corpus, considering it useless under the state of things produced by the new act passed so rapidly through both Houses. Evading the Scylla of the Serjeant-at-Axms, he may only fall into the Charybdis of the Penitentiary. His counsel, Mr. Reverdy Johnson, advises him to yield the point, and give up the names of those who expressed to him aw wish to make a good thing of their legislative functions, and leave those parties themselves to get out of the difficulty as they best may. This would turn the stream of indignation back, and hand over to the committee a few members of the House, which at present believes it has got the press on the hip in the person of one of its " miserable minions," as Mlr. Senator Tombs raia yesterday. This may prove a mistake, andc that the press has some of theLegislature in its power. However, the contest developes a rather surprising amount of ancient Toryism latent in the Conscript Fathers of the Republic; the language used in spealdng of the press souinds very like echoes of the days of Eldon and Castlereagh, of whigh the IkVr4ed bill just
- enactedhas some little ,traeo.' Who woula believe
that it is-the press that makesa_udunmaaked the m-en Who abuse it ? It is not an encouragement to a witness t"persit 'in encountering a kindorpiartyrdom to protect the culprits of the Lbegislature. It is not unlikely the. names may come out.
The Senato has again discussed the Atlantic Telegraph Bill, vith n imendmel lirnitinz the-aid to be given to tlhe underta6ng by the United Staits to that furnished by the British Government under its irst contract. It was passed on the 22d. The only disturbing anxiety about the line is, that no guarantee can be given for its use in time of war. The termini are on 1ritish territory, and it is conCeded that this is inavoidable; but the possession of one of them is not enough to secure the communic.ation. Mr. Seward stated his belief that the telegraph would prove one of the greatest agents in preventing war.
A bill has been brought into the State Legialaturec of New York abolishing the usage of allowing days of grace on bills of exchange, draughts payable at sight, and draughts payable at a subsequent day, if drawn upon a bank or banker. There is no uiniformity in the law and custom on this subject in the. difiberent States of the Union. In some the days' of grace are allowed by law, in others not ; in several States they are allowed by usage; in others usage is against them. As the practice only introduces confusion, and is no longer necessary from the greater facilities of. conirunication, it is pro_ posed to abolish it in the State of New York on the class of bills and notes above-named.
General Harvey, who has for some months been negotiating with the Florida Indians, has taken down the flag of truce, and declared wrar against them.
Mr. Charles Sumner has accepted his election as Senator, but it is doubtful whether his health will allow him to take his seat during any part of this session.
A box containing 40,000 dollars worth of diamonds was seized at the Custom-house on the 20th the attempt to smuggle them having been aeciden. tally discovered. It had arrived by the Washington from Southampton, and was addressed to Heule, Brothers, the largest importers of diamonds in the city. The authorities have searched their premises, and seized diamonds and other stones to the value of 150,000 dollars more on suspicion of their being smuggled. The consignees have been arrested ana released on bail.
One of those frequent cases of poisoning by mistake in preparing a prescription has occurred at Baltimore, but with an additional and very singular tragical result. The prescription was for a child, which it killed instantly. The physician took the remainder of the medicine to the druggist, and told him he had made a dreadful error. The druggist persisted he had not, and was so confident in his accuracy that he swallowed a portion of the mixture himself. It was a fatal confidence; his drugs were quick; in five muinutes he was a dead apothecauy. On analysis it appeared he had mixed a preparation of prussic acid strong enough to kill 50 men.

REroaxs OF THE NsSP oCTOSop FAcTropms.-The reports of the Factory Inspectors for the half-year ended the 31st of October last appeared in print on Saturday. From their conjoint reports it appears that the inspectors have applied themselves to the consideration of the duties under the act of last session in regard t the fencing of mill gearing and machinery. They find the provisions of the "arbitration"' clause wholly inadequate to afford that amount of protection to the operatives which they conceive mnst have be contemplated by the Legislature in passing the act of 1856, and they have therefore not taken any proceedings under that act. They do not object to the principle of arbitration, but to the class from which the arbitrators are requircd to be chosen, because that class is not qualified to act in such a capacity. The number of factories from which schedules were received in 1856 amounted to 5,117 against 4,600 in 1850, and 4,217 in 18.38. Of these 2,210 were cotton factories, 1,505 woollen, 525 worsted, 417 flax, and 460 silk. The cotton factories have increased 142 per cent., and the sltk 66 per cent. The woollen trade is beooming concentrated in Yorkshire, and the worsted manufacture is almost exclusively confined to the same county. The flax trade is most vigorous in Ireland. The number of spindles and looms in 1856 was respectively 33,503,580 of the former, and 369,205 of the latter, and the actual horse-power given in the returns is 161,435. Power-looms have increased from 115,801 (in 1836) to the nutmber already indicated-viz., 369,205. The average value of the cotton goods and yarn exported in the three years 1853, 1854, and M was, m rounad numbers, 31,000,0006; of woollen and worsted goods and yarn the avera exports forthree ars amounted 10,000,O00. The number of children emp oyed has decreased considerably in flax and woollen factories, while it has increased in worsted. The total number of children under 13 years of age employed in all Icnds of factories last year amounted to 46,071; the number of males between 13 and 18 to 72,220k the number of females above 13 to 387,S26; and thenumber of males above 18 years to 176,400-maldng a grand aggregate array, so to speak, of 682,497, There were during the halfvear 1,919 accidents from machinery, and 53 not due to macbinery.

Haymarket Theatre.
r HAYM ~ HEA .
1X6 :z^zrtBonhoMMn4, jl]no tcelebraled plecc produced at Paris during the: holo 0 yeir, was brought out in English forim at the ymarky t tre on Satbday mghto Althbugh- the scene of iaction is tranfierred from France to England, the original idea il pretrved and the original plot is close folloved, so that in giving the ontline of ?gztl plot feced People (65 1q verson is called), we *re, in point of fact, describing the wor.s with Which N;Yt Thipdtre 'arrisre and Ernest' e pindu edifed thd Vaundville audience last November.
The tendency of the pieca is symbolIzed by Mr. Scrunmmel (Mr. Ducklstone), a caricausrit by profes&on, who, in a tketehbook that hc always carries about witl him, draws the portraits of those 'persons whose outward appearance does inpt accord with their internal principles of action. Scrummel, with a brother artist named GeorgoeVedley (ir. W. Farrei), who cultivates a more serious branch of the profession, is stopping at the countryhouse of Mr. Jonathan Vadle (Mr. Chippendall), the chief of the doublefacod breed. While piinting Vacile's portrait, Medley has won the heart of his hos' s daughter Emily (Mr E. Fitzwilliam), who, however, is promised by her father to one Mr. Augustus Pike (Ur. Edwin Villiers). However, as Vacil is never troubled by scruples that rmilitate against his own interest,he speedily changes his intentions on learning that the artist is the nephew of his old friend Moneybee (Mr. R3ogers), renowned as a millionzaire. Accordingly, tho match with Pike is broken off, and Emily isformally engaged to the enthusiastic artist, when the whole aspect of affairs is altered by the arrival of Moneybee, who, deeply offended that his nephew has abandoned the Stock-Exchange for the studio, declares that he will not leave him a shilling. Pike is therefore restored to favour, and Medley is ignominiously expeled. ,
The secqnd act takes place at Mr. Vacilexs London resldence. Medley ia again the accepted suitor of Emily, for he has regained his unclo's good graces, and, throwing aside the palette and the essel, has become a furious speculator. Pike, who is backed by his friend Scripp (Mr. Braid), a gentleman deeply engaged in a bubble company, consoles himself for his disappointment by offering to take Vaclle's second daughter, Fanny (Miss Reynolds), and is joyfully accepted by the disinterested parent. The drop scene falls upon a most worldly squabble betweon Vacile and his intended sons-in-law,-he wishing to settle as little as possible on his daughters, and they insisting on a "high figure."
In the interval between the second and third acts the marriage of Medley and E,mily has taken place, and the gentleman, whose speculative propensities were merely asuned, has returned to his profession of painting, to the excessive indignation of Vacile.- However, that worthy man is brought to rain by the bursting of Scripp's bubble company, and is obliged to throw himself upon the magnanimity of his son-in-law, who has saved his wife's portion in expectation of a contingency of the sort. Pike breaks off his engageoent with Fauny, but she is more than consoled by a marriage with the honest caricaturist Scrauennl.
In this sketch of the plot we have omitted a few personages designed by the authors as types of the doublefaced class, who, though they do not greatly assist in carrying out the story, are of much service in filling up the dramatic picture. Thus, there is a Mr. Gloss (Mr. Cobip. ton), who always begins a sentence in a tone of the highest encomiam and breaks down with an "only." There is a Mrf. Wrangle (Mr. Cullenford), who is always charitable when he thinks the world is looking at his good deeds, and who, moreover, assists his wife (Airs. Poynter) in presenting the appearance of a devoted couple, though no two persons could more thoroughly detest each other. They are blessed with a son Tom (Mr. Clark), who is excedingly sleepy and stupid in decent society, but shines in wnknown regions as a professed gambler. This hopeful youth is for a time the accepted suitor of Panny Vacile, but he is overthrown in one of those many revolutions which in the course of the piece are caused by the never-failing cupidity of the lady's father.
The assembling together of so many types of character, all capable of being distinctly marked by histrionic art, is a most importantelement in the attractions of this lively piece. 3ypocrisy is, indeed, not new to the stage; nor, perhaps, does one of the "double-faced people" now presented show special qualities not alreay familiar to an audience. Mr. Vacile, ever plausible, and ever compelled to change his schemes by the force of circusm. stances, is a sort of Mercadet, and not wholly unlike SirJohn Vesey, while, as for Gloss, it is hard to suppose that his resemblance to Mrs. Candour is purely accidental. Bat this wantof novelty in the characters themselves doesnotlessen the amusement produced by their variety, and the skill with 'which they are all kept in eimultaneous movement by the authors is somsthing admirablo. Tihe uabble over the marriage settlement, on which the second act closes, is a masterpiece of stage contrivance; indeed, so potent is its effect that the third act, which is of a more sombre and lugubrious character, becomes an anti-climax.
Such a list of dramatis personcr, challenging, as it were,
every actor to mako some attempt at individual delinea- i tion, naturally called forth the energies of the Haymarket company , and we do not often see a play more equally or more zealously performed than this nowr comedy wras performed on Saturday night. Mr. Chippendale gave to the life the restless, scheming, fidgetty temperament of Vacile ; Mr. W. Farren assumed most naturaUy the " go-a-head" manner of the modern hero of speculation; Mr. Compton gave all force to the formidable " only;" Mr. Braid's sharp adventurer was most truthfully hit off; Mr. Cullenford and Mrs. Poynter wrangled efficiently in whispers; Mr. Rogers was the sturdy sullen man of money. The young ladies, who are not the most interesting characters in the piece, were rendered sufficiently amiable by Miss Reynolds and Mrs. E Fitzwillam. Strange to say, while apportioning the work among his company, M&r. Buckstone reserved the least thankful part to himself. The caricaturist, with his sketch-book-, symbolizes the leading Idea of the piece, as we have already said, but he himself is scarcely a character.
In conveying the scene of action across tho British Channel the adapter has executed his work well. The dialogue does not abound in wvit, and in the serious parts it sometimes becomes absurdly inflated; but it contains ges replete with worldly shrewdness, and lines thathit with force the prevailing follies of the day. Nevertheless, the adap'er would have done well to consult some person practica ly versed in city business before venturing to transfer the doings of the Parisian Bou7sc to the London Stock-Exciangp. As it was, the parties intended to be Tery knowing, not unfrequently dropped remarks that would have appeared extremely " verdant" in the ndighbourhood of Capel-court.

Royal Patronage Of The Drama.-The pro-
RoYAL PA?TRONAGE or = DnBxi.-The proceedings at the Lambeth Police-office, on Monday, present a case in whiclithe name and character of Her Majesty are much scandalized. On the evening of Wednesday week there was a theatrical performance, by command, at Windsor Castl] the performersbeing, of course, selected from among the most eminent on the metropolitan boards, Among these was Mr. James Rogers, an actor of repute in his linie, and a great favounxte with his audiences. Oni Monday Mr. Elliott, the maListrato at Lambeth, read a naote he had received from M1r. !Roge.rs, enclosing, for the poor. box, the amount the latter hbad received for performiing before the Court at Windsor Castle. That amiount was 13s. 4d. I Now, we askc who is to blame for this acandalous transaction? Who is to blamie for endeavouring to bring the sanae of Her Majesty into contemnpt by a proceeding so shabby in the extreme as this? Is it the Lord Steward, Earl Spencer- or the Controller, Viscount Castlerosse; or the kaster of the Household, Colonel Biddulph- or the Manager of Her Majesty's Theatricslg, fr. Charles ean? The rate of payment for contributing to 4he Royal gratification must hiave been made by somebody- who was the lberal recompenser of the act6ra' servicest We suppose the others were paid in the same ratio? Who is this actor's friend, that commands his presence to Windsor to play before the Queen, and then so freely rewards him for his labour and expenditure, for employiDg his ntmost effort to amuse and edify the Court, with the astounding sum of 13g. 4d. ? The amount makes us think(theto musS be a lawyer in the ease, wlo..ealculating the tinnos each actor appeared before the ludienoe; or, perhaps, the nnmberDfwordseachlhadtos spak, paidthem-each, fortheirtrouble, at so mueh perfolio, after the fashion of the stationers in Chaneery-lane, amd at much about the same irte-4d. for 72 words. Mr. oers, in his brief note, very properly confines himself strictI to transmittin the amount and stating the occasion for which he received it. That he must have felt indignaut we can well imagine, but he forebore to rive expression to his feel! ings; and we are sure that the frequenters of the OlymrpiC Theatre, where we perceive he is now engaged, will harly fail to appreciate, not only the delicacy he exerclsed in for. bearance, but also the "resolution to stand by his order" which he has evinced en tisoccasion.

CLAP.BAf-COAfMON
TO THE EDITOR OF TfE TIMES.
Sir,-May I request a small spaceo in your columns to remonstrate upon an occurrence which bas taken place witbin the last few days, to the extreme disgust and annoyance of the whole neighbourhood of Clapham?
For many years past the lord of the manor has granted a leaso of Clapham-common to a certain number of inhabitants, with a view to its improvement. Trees have been planted, the verdure has been carefully preserved, and aln hollow places filled up, at a cost of several thousands of pounds, and the common now presents the aspect of a beautiful park, and is allowed to be one of the most agreeable places of the kind in the neighbourhood of the metropolis. The lessees have had a common-keeper, who has kept a vigilant eye upon all incidents calculated ho injure the common or destroy its beauty; and up to this moment the residents have felt unmingled pleasure in the state of perfection to which, by their long-continued efforts, the comnmon bss been brought. This state of things was interrupted about a week ago by the surveyor to the Board of Works bringing a number of labourers with their spades to dig for gravel ir. one of the most conspicuous parts of the common, without asking the permission of any person whatever, and in front of some of the handsome houses which surround the common; and now, instead of the beautiful park-like appearance, from the windows of the residents are to be seen heaps of gravel, with carts loading and cutting up tha grass, to the extreme irritation and anluoyance of the whole neighbourhood. It is said that the act of Parliament authorizes thisstep; but if so, surely some discretion is lodged, to be exercised in cases of this nature, and it is to be hoped. that the authorities will at once interfere, and put a stop to such a flagrant violation of the comfort of so large a community, as well as evince some regard to the feelngs of society, and to the value of property, which is by this actr likelv to undef-n s r i .

PARMS, FiDA)Ly, FEB. 6. 6 P.M.
A private letter from Bombay, dated the beginning of last month, states as follows:-
" We have had here for eight days the French frigate Sibyl!e, which has left to proceed to the Persian Gulf. Since her departure from Brest, now three years ago, for the lFreaCh station in the China Seas she has passed through szvere trials. Her officers and men have successively perished-she has lost nearly the whole of her crew. At Singapore, where she stopped before coming to Bombay, ,she suddenly lost three of her offlcers besides the officer :second in command, 3J. d'Estrenaux, who had the rnk of Capitaiane deffr,gate. l1. d'Estrenaux committed suicide at Singapore, after a violent altercation which took place between him and M. Sinonet de Malsonneuve, who com2nanded the Sibylle. The Sibylle appears to have a double mission to fuhlf in the Persian Gulf£;-first of all, to watch the events which may arise from the present war with Persia, and on this point ht. de IMaisonneuve has received particular instructions; and to exactly asoertain the disposition of the mauxn of Muscat, who abour 10 years ago concluded with France a treaty of commerce, which can hardly be said to have been executed. The commander of the Sibylle has also orders to explore carefuUy the whole of the Persian Gulf, with a view to ascertain what are the advantages French comumerce may derive from the friendly relations which have been just established with the Shah of Persia. We are assured that the French Government is desirous of giving all the extension in its power to its trade in those parts."
The Moniteur de I'Arme publishes some curious details relative to the army of the King of Siam. One corps particularly attracts the attention of straugers, which is a battalion of the King's Guard composed of women. This battalion consists of 400 women, chosen among the handsomest and most robust girls in the country. They receive exceUent pay, and their discipline is perfect. They are admitted to serve at the age of 13, and are placed in the army of reserve at 25. From that period they no longer serve about the King's person ut (,re employed to guard the Royal palaces and - Crown lands. On entering the army they make a
vow of chastity, from which there is no exemption unless any of them should attract the King's attention and be admitted among his le'itimate wives. The King's choice seldom galls on the most beautiful, but on the most skilled in military exercises. The hope of such a reward animates them with extraordinary zeal for military instruction, and Europeans are astonished at the martial appearance of that battalion, as well as its skill in manceuvring and its excellent discipline. The costume these women wear is very rich. Their full dress is composed of a white woollen robe, emnbroidered with gold. The cloth is extremely fine, and descends as far as the knee; it is covered with a light coat of mail and a gilt cuirass. The arme are free, and the head is-covered with a gilt casque. When wearing thisdress on State occasions their only weapon is a lance, which they handle with wonderful dexterity. With their undress they are armed with a musket. The battalioniscomposedof four companies, and each company of 100 women, commanded by a captain of their sex. Should the captain die, th. company is drilled for three days by the King. who appoints the most competent to succeed to the command. The battalion has been commanded for the last five years by a woman who saved the King's life at a tiger hunt by her courage and skldl. She possesses great influence at Court, and is much respected by those under her command. She has the same establishment as a member of the Royal family, and 10 elephants are placed at. her service. The King never undertakes any expedition without being accompanied by his female guard, nor does he ever hunt, or even ride out, without an escort of the same guard, who are devotedly attached to his person. Each individual of the battalion has five negresses attached to her service, and, having thus no domestic occupation, she can devote herself exclusively to the duties of her profession. There is a parade-ground near the city,where one company iS stationed for two days every week to exercise themselves in the use of the lance, the pistol, the musket, and the rifle. The King attends once a month at those exercises, accompanied by his brother, who shares in some degree the sovereign power, and distributes prizes to those most deserving. These rewards consist of bracelets or other valuable jewelry, to which the girls and their families attach great importance. Those so honoured fill the offices of sergeant and corporal. Pnnishment is very rare in this corps, and when it is inflicted it consists of a suspension from service for a period not exceeding three months. But duels are much more frequent. They must be sanctioned, however, by the female captain, and be fought with swords in presence of the entire company. When the death of one of the parties ensues the deceased receives a magnificent funeral, and the high priest pronounces a panegyric declaring that the deceased by her valour has merited eternal rest in the abode of the blessed. The survivor receives the congratulations of her companions; but, as a measure of discipline, she is sentenced to pass twvo months away from her company in fasting anld prayer. The military organization of this battalion is so perfect that the entire army endeavonrs to imnitate it.

The Pays announces that, while the Chinese Government shows itself so unfriendly to foreigners, the King of Corea has spontaneously opened the ports on his coast to commercial ships of all nations. The kingdom of Corea, which lies between Manchooria, Japan, and the Straits of Corea, contains many fertile districts, and produces many articles suited for export to Europe. The King Of Corea acknowledges the suazerainty of the Court of Pekin, but he is completely independent as to the government of his kingdom.

A letter from Rome of the 27th of January inforras us that the new year has been inaugurated-by the tribunal della scwra constdta with two political trials., Adolfo hIancini dellU iccia has been sentenced to the galleys for life. He was implicated in the affair of Velletrl and had escaped to Genoa, but having returned privately to, the Roman States he was discovered and arrested. In consequence of ill health he was trans. feared from the prison to the hospital, and succeeded
inlakinghisaape byahole in the wall. 0 Eewas again arrested, tried, and sentenced to the galleys - and nevertheless the offieial journals amioifticed that. all the persons compromised in the affair of Velletri had been pardoned. The brother of Mancini is among the last convicts. He has a family, is very poor and, moreover, deaf. His crime is having affordeaa shelter to his brother, and having concealed him from the police. Bernardi, a poor stonecutter, has been sentenced to the galleys for 20 years because Maneini was found in his house. Much noise was made in official quarters because Dr. Ripani, of cremons, whohad been sentenced to hard labourfor20years, had beenpardoned. He owes his release fromprison totheFrench General Allonveau de Montreal, who, by orders from Yfarshal Vaillant, Minister of War, claimed hint. Dr. Ripani was physician to Garlbaldi's legio3l, and after the fall of Rome he remained under thb protection of the Commander-in-Chief of the Emnch troops. The Papal police, nevertheless, arrted him and cast him into prison. Cardinal Antonelli made many objections to the doctor's release, but he was ultimately compelled to yleld to the demand of the French Government. The doctor's discharge from prison has been extolled as a spontaneous at of the Papal Government., althsough it iswell known that the Bizho~p of Cremona had repeatedly applied for Dr. Ripanm's discharge, to whom he Is relates, but w/ithout success. He was even reprimanded by the Papal Government for his interference, and desired to attend to his own affairs.

On Saturday sthe 24th instdthhe Commission for the Principalities had its audFence of leave of the Sultan. It was entirely a private interview, resembelng more an amicable reception than a State ceremony. No guards were vnder arms, as is usualy the cases on such occasions, and all the habitual display of attendants was dispensed with, the only person present, besides the Comzissioners, boing Ethem Pasha, the Mlinister of Foreign Affairs, who acted as interpreter. The Embassy sent, indeed, a dragoman for the British Commissioner, but none of the other Commuissioners havng brought one the services of this gentleman were likewise dt s iensed wuith, and he was left in the antechamboer the reception took place not in the Stake apartments but in one of the private rooms of the Sultan, who himself, as well asthe Minister of Foreign Affairs, was in plain clothes and withoult any decorations. In strange contrast with this homely simplicity was the full dress of the Commissioners, who had been told that they were expected to come in uniiform. The French Commissioner, however, took the opportunity of explaining this mistake to the MIinister of Foreign Afairs, asking him to make the excuses of the Commission to His Majesty.
The customary compliments having been gone through, the Sultan drew a paper from his pocket and read a kind of farewell address to the Commission in Turkish, which was translated to them by Ethem Pasha. In this address, which was of considerable length, the Sultau expressed a hope that the Commission would successfully terminate its labours, and that it wouId take care to keep the sovereign rights of the Sultan inviolate. To this address appropriate answers were returned by every member of the Commission, to the effect that they would endeavour to accomplish their task so as to maintain the sovereign rights of His Majesty, to give satisfaction to their respective Governments, and a due consideration to the wishes of the Principalities.
Thus the Commission may be considered to have closed the first and certainly most ungrateful part of its duty. When the Commissioners started for Constantinople it was under the impression that they would have only to pass through this place, and that before the altumn closed everything would be settled, and they might begin their work at Bucharest. It was difficult to see from the beginning why the Commission should come to Constantinople at all, unless they were to be consulted about the firman to be issued for the convocation of the Divans ad hoc in the Principalities. As thiswas not the intention of the Government the activity of the Commission was confined to an acte de presence, that is to say, looking on without doing anything, and their instructions merely directed them to certify, as it were, by their presence the sending of the firman. It would be difficult to conceive instractions more illogical than these, for surely, if the resident representatives were to be trusted with the preparation of the firman, they might just as well have been trusted with the sending of it. The long delays in the negotiations abaut Bolgrad and the change in the Ministry, which retarded the drawing up of the firman, contributed not a little to render this delicate position of the Commission even more embarrassing, without furthering in the least the object of the Commission. Even the mixed conference, wfhich wouldhave afforded an opportunity for this, was turned into a matter of form.
No wonder that all the members of the Commission were anxious to get out of this position, and as soon as the firman had been finally settled they applied for further instructions. As the Austrians are only to evacuate by the 30th of March, and the Commission not to begin its work until then, nearly all asked for leave of absence until that period. The Austrian, Russian, and Prussian Commissioners have received this permission, and they are to start in a few days for Vienna. The French Commissioner, on the contrary, who applied for leave to take, during the remaining interval, a trip to Svria, received at first the answer to wait for further instructions, and is now ordered to go as soon as possible not to Syria, but to Bucharest. I have not heard that the British and Sardinian Commissioners have received any instructions as to their movements. Thus, according to appearaneQs, there seems to be some difference in the views taken by the different Governments as to the manner in which their Commissionersare topass their time up to the lst of ApriL Certainly there is some advantage in being first in the field, and obtaining some knowledge of the ground before the actual work be,uins, but is it not to be apprehended that those vvho will be there before the others may be biassed in their opinions and come to conclusions before there is an opportunity of hearing all sides of the question? Thus it is scarcely possible that the Commissioners, if they should he in the Principalities before their public
action begins, should remain altogether stringers to the underhand activity which is sure to manifest itself as soon as the first measures are taken for the elections. Thus the presence of the Commissioners before their time seems only calculated to add an element more of confusion to those already existing.

VIENNA, FE% 4.
The Emperor is still at Milan, and the best-informed persons in this city are as ignorant as myself of the day on which His Majesty Intends tobegin his homeward journey. On the 28th of January their Majesties went to the top of the Cathedral of Milan, from which there is a fine, though distant, view of the Alps. On the same day a long visit was paid to the Brera Palace which immense edifice contains the Academy of Science and Iiteratusre, an observatory, a technological and mechanical museum, the Academy of Fine Arts the Pinakothek (gallery of pictures), a gymnasium, a large library a collection of coins, and a botanical garden. At -the masquerade which took l place in the Scala on the 28th nIt. the occupants of the boxes and pit slihoutea-" Ti voliamo sene ("Wehaveakidndly feeling towards you"); " Yiens
abbasso" (" Come below"). That their Majesties did not venture into the midst of such a dense and noisy crowd need hardly be said. Baron Hess,
- - -
who lodged at the AIbergo Reale, has, by order of Bia Majesty, removed toapartments in thelmperial Palace. The Milan correspondent of the Oestr.'eichische Zeitung writes, that one of the principsi features in the new- military organization is, Ztfat the pay of the subaltern officers ana the privates is raised. As a consequence of telegraphic com-Munications, the political prisoners were liberated directly after the publication of the amnesty. Five Italian prisoners, who were confined at Olmiutz, in Moravia, have passed through this city on their way to their homes. One of the persons pardoned, a Signor Perego, who was formerly employed in the principal hospital at Milan, was so overjoyed when the door of his prison was opened, and in such a violent hurry to get home, that he fell down a staircase of 25 steps. Thepoor man was not very seriously hurt, but he otil walks about Mian with his head bandaged.
Official information has again been given me that aU those political refugees who ask pardon of the Emperor will receive it, and be permitted to return to their homes.
THE STATE OF NAPLES.
(FROM OUR OWN CORRrSPoNDEWT.)
NAPLES, FEB. 2.
The position of things in Naples is of the strangest character, and to every thinlking mind it must be the subject of wonder that society can hold together. It is not too much to assert that the Ki3ng and his subjects are almost in open opposition to one another. Facts are continuall brought to my knowledge which prove that Caserta is in a state of siege, and from those who have recently visited it I learn that a line of soldiers is drawn up permanently in front of the Palace, and sentinels stationed all around it; that a field-marshal even was accompanied on his arrival by a soldier-showing that what I asserted as to the rule is true. In short, His Majesty has shut himself up in Caserta, surrounded himself with a military cordlon, and defies both the foreigner and native.
It is said that the Governnent of the Two Sicilies confidently hopes that the Legations of the allied Powers will return, if the terms of the treaty lately concluded with the Argentine Confederation be accepted. It is even added that the British Go. vernment in particular will be contented with this concession. As a plan of colonization offered by the Argentine Republic it is large and generous, and by free men might be accepted, but, as offered by the Government of the Two Sicilies, it is no amnesty (though here it is called so), but a cornmutation of punishment. Voluntary, it is said, will be the acceptance of the terms, but it is difficult to discover anything voluntary in the consent of men who are threatened with imprisonment and irons or detention on an island for an indefinite number of years as the alternative of their refusal. The strongest moral compulsion, therefore, is undeniably used. It is not improbable that some will accept it, so hopeless is the alternative.
The scrutiny continues in the army. Two officers of the 3d Regiment of Cacciatori were taken under arrest to St. Elmo on the night of the 27th or 28th. There, too, is confined the captain of the company to ,vhieh EIlano belonged; not a night passes in which, I am told, some soldiers are not put under arrest. Of 800 persons in the prisons of the Vicaria 96 are said to be of gentle birth and 106 soldiers. The entire regiment of the 3d Battalion of Cacciatori was on Tuesday, the 27th, by a general order, put under arrest. General Nunziante, who corninands the 13th Regiment of the Cacciatori, immediately went off to Caserta, but had no audience. Yesterday he went over again, with what results I do not know. A proclamation, which I have not yet seen, is circulating among the army, as is also a biography of Milano.
From Sicily I have the foUowing intelligence -
Fearing an invasion, the Government has issued three circulars to the authorities, the first of which speaks of a report that emigrants from Malta and Genoa iatended to land in Sicily, with arms and ammunition, under the protection of a foreign Power, and that they were to be preceded by a vessel with provisions and proclamations. A cordon of Urban Guards, under the command of captainsat-arms, was ordered thereupon to be drawn round Sicily. As these emig~rants were said to be in relation with people m the interior, all suspicious persons were to be stopped, powder-mills to be closed, and powder carried off to the Royal castles. A second circular, quoting the authority of the Sicilian Consul in Malta, reports the departure of the emigrants from Malta, and orders a double cordon to be drawn round the island. A third circular speaks of an Englishmnan called Charles - (the circular is very definite), who has recently passed through Italy, and taken into his pay revolutionists; that this "C monstrum horrenldum . . cui nomen. ademptam" waslanded in Sicily. His intercourse with Sicilians is, therefore, to be well watched. In the neighbourhood of Catania the above directions had been carried into effect. The east coast is strictly guarded, and the teleg,raph employ&s are ordered to lookwell out for all suspicious craft. 25 persons had been arrested at Messina, and sent off by Royal steamer to the island of Favignana, on the west coast.
A Freclch frigate and a largeUnited States'steamer have come into port.
Thursday, the 29th of January, was the anniversary of the granting of the constitution,-an event which is not, and will not, be forgotten by the Neapolitans. The Government celebrated it by arresting 79 persons in the caffe's and billiardrooms near the Teatro Fiorentini, and consigning them to the Vicaria. Such, at least, is the number reported at the prison itself to have been received. The liberals celebrated it after their fashion. The walls in the Toledo and other parts of the city were covered with tricolour placards in the form of flags; on a new house in the Mercatello and in the Largo Castello cloth flags were said to have been found with the same device. In the Villa Reale, also, cards with tricoloured emblems were found scattered about the walls. I ain informed that the reason for arresting the masses on the evenings of the 9th and 10th of January was that a correspondence had been discovered between Mazzinians in Genoa and some Neapolitans. 'The present state of panic is, however, a source of great wealth to the police, and all kinds of tricks will be resorted to in order to keep up the delusion. This state of things will not be understood by the foreigner; but it is too well understood by the Neapolitan, who is often denounced and arrested for the sake of the bribe which procures his liberty. Cases ad nausearn might be adduced in proof of this. The whole power of thepoliceis now virtually in the hands of the prefect, who, according to law, is only the instrument and servant of the Director of Police. But it was found impossible to make a tool of Signor Bianohini, and therefore the prefect has been charged, l am told, with all these recent acts of violence under the highest guarantees. The intelligence of the large and generous amnesty granted by the Emperor of Austria has awakened rather feelings of rearet and disappointment among the Court party in Raples. A contrast most unfavourable to this country has thus been established, and it is resented by insinuations that Austriabhas allied herself with Eng,oland and France and has become a demagogue. The position of this Government is, indeed, as sad as it can be, for by a long course of violence and injustice it has rendered an amnesty an impossibility unless connected with larger measures of a
constitutional clharacter.
ITALY.
(PROM OUlR OWN CORESroh(DRNT.)
TURIN, Fm. 3.
On the afternoon of the lit inst. King Maximl,ia1
of Bavaria arrived at Milan. The Emperor drove out to the Treviglio Railway station to meet him
and they drove together thence in the Emperoes carrage to the Royal palace, where apartments were prepared for the Royal visitor. It was said at Milan that the Grand Duke of Tuscany was expected there shortly with hisfamily. The only other news that has reached here the last two days from the further side of the Ticino, towards which all eyes are turned in hopes of discerning something of the future 'policy of Austria in Italy, is that the lower classes of Mlan have been decidedly caught by the glitter of the Court. It appears, indeed, that-the working classes have been persuaded that the, presence of the Coirt is a great boon,to the to and that tbemnon-attendanoe of the nobles at Coutt is a positive loss to themselves. Can anything be
more natural ? People whose political ideas don't r ange beyond the bounds of evident personal advantages are easily led to believe that the Govern-
ment which' causes monAt expenditure must be, the bsst
for the commonwealth, just as aa income-tat would be excessively popular with those who escaped i's
diret acien, an hOOU coldiot'appreciate how it would indirectly affect; their own interests. The feelings-of the upper classes are xaid to remain uachaNed. Count-Thun, at present Adlatus to Marhal Radetzky, is to be named Lieutenant of Lorabardy in successon to Baron Barger, who will be mad9 Minister of Justice at Vienna; and, as he is a person of good family and his wife accounted snirifuede and comnme iifaut, it is hoped thatthey tfgether will succeed better in conciliating the Milanese aristocracy than the Baron and Baroness Burger, who laboured, however diligently, under the nsurmountable defect of not having been of nobIe birth.
The journey of the King of Bavaria excites some attention here, because there is no doubt that he oriinally had intended coming to Turin, but that he has recently changed his mind on the subject. Some time ago M. Doenigues, a gentleman weln known in the literary world, and a cowseiler intime of the Bawvarian (lovernment, came here on a special miuion wvhich was known to consi!st chiefly in mraking arrangements for his Sovereigns vsit to this city, but it has now been officially notified that ho has ceased to represent the Bavarian Government at thia Court, and, as the Bavarian MUinister accreditedi here is residing at Rome, it. seems evident that, King Maximilian does not mean now to honour Turin with his presence. Such change of purpose is supposed to have the more signifcance at this moment, when so much is said of the formation of an Austro -Italian league of Sovereigns for the purpse of sending the King of Sardinia and his Government to Coventry.
SPAIN.
The Madrid journals of the 2d have arrived. That day being the anniversary of the attempted assassination of the Queen by the priest Merrmo, a solemn thanksglving for her Majesty' preservation had been offered up in the ch
of Atocha. The Marquise de Turgot being indisposed, the receptions at the French En-. bassy had been suspended; but her illness was not serious. A good deal of snow had fallen in all the provinces; in that of Oviedo the fall was so heavy that the roads had been impassable for eight days. At Madrid the snow was only slight, but the cold was intense. It was said that the Spanish Govermment does not accept
the postal treaty with France recently negotiated by I M. Olozaga,and that it intends to propose a counterproject. The discovery of a Democratic conspirac
at Barcelona is confirmed. The conspirators were just about to cause an insurrection to break out when they were detected by the authorities.

WILLEs and Specia Juri4l r
This Was an action on a bond conditicnfA for the payraent of 1,00W., brought by the plaintiff, Miss Mary Wakler, hotsekoeper of the late Mr. John Esam, of Sutton. upon-Trent, againAst the defendants, as executors of Xr. Esan The defendants pleaded that the bond was obtained by fraud and covin of the plaintiff in collusion with others, and alas that the deceased, Mr. Esam, was drunk when he signed this bond, and unable to comprehend its meaning.
Mr. s. Temple, Q.c., and mr. Keane appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. SerijeautByleg, Wr. Unthank, and Mr. Powell, for the defendant.
Mr. Txarla; in his opening statement, said, the action was brought on a bond for 3,0001, given to the plaintiff by the late Mr. Essm, and the main question raised by the defence was whether when the deceased executed it he was in such a state of intoxication as not to know what he was about. The deceased, Mr. Eeain, resided at Sutton-on.
Trent, and died on the 23d of May, 1856, aged 73. His will was dated October, 1855, which created the defendants his executors. Tho deceased had been twice married ; his first wife died In 184L He soon after married again, but a ahort time before 1848 he was separ,ted from his second wife, and on the 12th of May, 1848, the plain. tiff became his housekeeper. The second -wife of the decemsed died in May, 1849. A.fter the plaintiff went to live as honsekeeper to the deceased he showed a great par. tlityfor her, andafterthe death of his second wife he proposed to marry her, and took a house at Newark to live in. The marriage, however, did not take place before the old man died. In l850the deceased gave tho plaintiff a pronissory note for 1,000., and he also told her he had left her an annuity in bis wilL He had also made an agreement by which he agreed to give the plaintiff 1,000W., on condition of her remaining with him till he died. In 1855 the old man renewed his promissory note. In 1856 he made another will, and in March of that year expressed his wish to sub. stitutO a beOd for tho promissory noto,-and at the plaintiff's request an attorney named Esam, living at East Retford, prepared the bond. Mr. Buckley, the surgeon of the de. ceased, was present when the bond was executed, to whom the deceased said he intended to provide for the plaintiff, and he was then quite sober. A r. Bell was the attestin
witness to the bend, and he had since made proposals of marriae to the plaintiff. Mr. Bell was in the deceased's confidence, and had once been named by him as his execu. tor, and had been senLt for by him purposely to witnes the execution of the bond.
Miss Mary Walker, the plaintiff, a good-looking young woman, of considerable shredwness of expression, was then examined.-She said she went into the testator's service on the 12th of May, 1848, as housekeeper, at 121. a-year wages. Afterwards it was arranged, at Mr. 13am's request that she should find grocenes for the family And have the profits of the cows. At that time Mr. Esam had a second wife, from whom he was sepa. rated. His second wifo died in May, 1849. After that Mr. Esam mado her an offer of marriage and she accepted it. The day was not fixed. He told her he had purchased a small property to reside on after the marriage at Farndon, as he could not reside at Sutton on account of his daughter, wholived there. In the beginning of 1850 or at the end of 1849 the testator said he wished to provide for her in the event of his death before the marriage taking place, by a promissory note. He then also entered into an !greement with her to give her 1,0001., on condition that she lived with him tiUl his death. The dceased had a grandson-William Anthony Esam-who came to reside with his grandfather. He was in bad health and obliged to go on crutches, and died in L2 months at hisgrandfather's. Before his death he asked leave of his grandfather to give her a watch and a silver tankard for her kind attention to him. The testator assented to this, and made a memorandum of the gift. In 1855 the testator told her the promissory,noto was nearly run out, and he vished her to have a new one, and he prepared one and gave it to her. The note was for 1,0001., and it was destroyed by the testator whenhe gaveherthe bond. The testa. torfrequently spoke to her about hermarriagc, and suggested that she should go to Nottingham about a fortnight fefore theywere to bo married, and be marriedthere,andcomehome
at night, as his relations disapproved it. She bought clothes. and he bought a ring. Miss Davison was to be bridesmaid, and her father was to give her away. At the tiin6m of the testator's death he was 73 years of age. In MaTcb, shortly before his death, he told her to have a bond prepared, as it was a better security, and might save her some unpleasantness at his death. She got the bond made by Mr. Esam, the attorney, and gave it to the testator. The bond was executed on the 13th of March. The testator dined at 12 o'clock, and the plaintiff and Mr. BeU dined with him. After dinner he executed the bond, and Mr. BelU witnessed it. The testator gave her the bond at 6 that night in exchange for her promissory note, and he burnt the note. No one else was present. Mr. Buckleywashismedical attendant, and was there on that day, She remained till the testator's funeraL
Cross-examined.-3Mr. Bell, who witnessed the bond. was here. She was 35 years of age. She had visited Scar. borough with Mr. Bell last July, after the testator's death, and had stopped two or thre wveeks there with and his daughter. 1They had one sitting room and two lodging rooms. She afterwards went to her father's. She was engaged to be married to Mr. Bell. The day was not fixed. She could not say how many days it was after or before ;'r. Esaim's death that she became engaged to Mr. BoU. The first thing Mr. Esam gave her was a copy of his will, by which he gave her an annuity of 501. a-year. The next thing was the produce of his three cows. The nexb thing ,he got was a promise of marriage-a fortnight or a month after his second wife's death. The next thing she got was the watch and silver tankard, and some other. silver. The tankard was broken up at Mr. Easm's request, as it was a family piece of silver. She sold it. The next thing she liPd was a promissory note for 1,0001 - and then she got the agreement, and afterwards a reneoeid note, and the present bond for that note. He was sober when he signed the bond. Neither Mr. Talbot nor Mr. Smithealled at the house the aftrnoon that tho bond was executed. The teetator read the bond over twice before he executed it. The testator had three grandchildren-the children of his son-and a daughter, 'with children living. He wanted to give her some silver a week before he died, and she wanted a tailor in the village to witness hisgiving it. On the 14th of March (the day after the bond wvas executed), she got a certificate from Dr. Watts that the testator wvas in a condition to dispose of his property. She sent for Dr. Watts at the request of the testator. She did not wish hinm to he there at 2 o'clock. He was quite sober when Dr. Watts saw him.
William ?Ped was then examined, aud stated that the testator had originally appointed him his executor' that afterwards be offered witness the lease of a farm of ibO acres and the house he lived in. Messrs. Newbald and Faulkner the testtor's solicitors, declined to make the lease as he was named ss executor in the testator's will, as they told him it would not be right to do so. He afterwards got the lease made, and by a codicil another executor was appointed. He was sent for on the 13th of March, the dy the bond was executed, and dined with the testator and Miss Walker, and be was as right and as mild as he ever saw him in his life. He sent Miss Walker for the bond after dinner, and told witness that he might read it before be signed it. He did read it, and said to the tes. tator, "M r. Esam, this Ls 1,0001. you are going to give to Miss 'Valker." He said, "Yes, it is." He signed it, and v'itness was going to sign it under his signature, when the ttstator said, "You must not sign it there," and showed him where to sign it as a witness. The testator was perfectly sober when he signed it, and was so when witnessleft at 5 o'clock. He was sent by the teatator with a message to Dr. Watts, to say that he wished to see him nexct day. He did not say what ho wanted. Since the death of MEr. Besam he had paid his addresses to MIiss Walker.
Cross examined.-He had since purchased a part of tho testator's estate. He could not sy whether he proposed t
isLs Walker before or after the bend.
The making of the bond by Mr. Esam, attorney, and the visit to the testator by Dr. Watts the day after the bond was execnted, were then proved.
Dr. Watts was desired by the witness BeU to see the testator at 2 o'clock next day. He saw the testator at that time. He was then sober, and he certified that he was capable oE attending to his affairs after sitting with him about an hour.
Mr. Backley, the surgeon of the testator, also proved that he saw him between 9 and 10 o'clock on the morning of the 13th of March, and was asked to witness the bond execated, but declined to di so. The testator was then sober.
Cros? examined.-lHe was a man of intemperate habits, and he had frequently seen him intoxicated.
A witness named Davison proved that the testator tolde him he wished to make a provision for Miss Walker, as he should in all erob&bility mary her, in consideration that she remained with hint, and he wished him to give her away, and witness's daughter to be her bridesmaid.
The testator's real and personal estate were proved to bi about 6,OOO. in value on his death.
This was the plaintiff's case.
Mr. Serjeant BYLES, in addrcs3ng the jury for the defendants, said, that they had no object but conscientiously to administer the propertydof the testator for the benefit of hischildren and grandchildren, and they felt that they oughtnot, unquestioned, to pay the bend on which the pla2ntiff sued. The learned c,unsel said that the cireum-
lliantces under which it lfad been obtained were most
suspicious. Here wast a drunken, dribbling, foolish old man in the bend of a designing CoMn woman who bad the
management of his house, Iho had obtained frorm hint before she had bcen many months in his honse an annuity of 50l a-year charged on his l estate, under what circumstances they could not telL. Then she obtained
from him the milk money, then a quantity of plate, then a r,romise of marriage, then a promsstory note for 1,OOOf- and what was the onsideration? eThat note woifd have been valeldess <without consideration; an then she got him to giveher a bond for the note, whic was binding for its mount, without any consideration whatever. This bend had been obtained from a strnge attorny by the aintiff, and wassent to her. It w-a attested by William Bell. who had promised her marriage, whether before or after that period they could not ten; no
one else but the plaintiff atI he beni present when it i

Witnesses were then called, who proved that during the last threo months of the testator's life he Ws CDntinually drunk, and had lost his meemory, and wa.abls to manage his affairs.
A witness, named Thomas Browr low, who hki been 48 years in testator's servico, said he used to talk almost anything. Ho us to sit Up a good deal of the night and drinl, and was drunk next mornmin, and was never perfectly sober for tho hat two or throe months of his life till the lsut three weeks before his death, when he got weak. " He used to drink till he fellaseeop and when he woke up boosin and drink sgain. He ws vey uneasy in his mind about his daughter, Mrs. Smith, na nused to inquire about her. She seldom came to see him. Miss Wailker would not let her. He had seen Miss Walker the plaintiff) sh-t the door in Mrs. Smith's (his daughterSefae, and say she could not see her father-he was

Witness used to dine with the tegtator on a Sunday, and he used to see his daughter pass to church,audwould3ay to witness "There is Mr. and hMr. Smith going," and he would cry. Witnes said to him, "1 You shouldrememberyrown crJ, W1 u he sAid "I will." mme oroncid; n
Other witnesses, who had been his servants, spoke to his oontinuous drunken habits.

Both the rector and himself had repeatedly called after this, but were never able to ,et to see him, being refused admission by the housekeeper [ill! the day before his death, when he was insensible. Whea be used to see him his hands trembled much, and he usedto lift his glass to his mouth vith both bands.
A witness named Talbot overseer of Button, pzoved haVing called along with the teseator's gandson, youeD mith, on the testator, at half-past 3 o'cloc on the 13th of March, the day the bond was executed, for a church-rato of 11. 2s. 4d., and finding him drunk He was so drunk- he could not count the money, and pushed two sovereigns and a-half across the table to pay the rate. He was too drunk to shake hands, mau fell back in his ehair on attempting to rise frum it.
This was corroborated by the witness Smith, who p?roved that his mother, the testator's daughter, had nine children, ar.d he had three cousins named Esam, the children of the t-estator's son.
This was the defendants' case.
3Mr. Serjeant BYL1S having summed up, Mr. TEMIPLE replied, and
The Court was adjourned at half-past 7 o'clock.

Mr. Justice WMLEs commenced summing up this ease this morning, directing the jury that if in their opinion, on the evidence, the testator was intoxicated so as not to know what he was about when he delivered the bond, to find for the defendant; if not for the plaintiff. His Lordship's summing up occupied two hours.
Thejury then retired and not being able to agree upon their verdict were discharged by his Lordship at the risiDng of the Court at 6 o'clock, without delivering any verdict.

This was an action charging the defendant with having eebauched and carnally known the plaintiffswife. The defendant pleaded "Not Guilty."
Sir F. Thesiger, Q.C., Mr. F. J. Smith, and Mr. T. At. kinson appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Edwin James, Q0C., mnd Mr. Hawkins for the defendant.
Sir F. THSIGER, in opening the case, said,-I never feel more embarrassment and difficulty than when I have to aisoharge my duty in a case of this description, arising out cf the very extraordinary character of the 'whole proceeodings. As the law at present exists-I trust it may not long continue to bo the law-where a wife has broken the mar. dage vow, and where tbe husband is desirous of severing the tie which binds them, he is obligod to obtain the verdict Df a jury and damages for the reparation of his domestic happiness-a species of reparation utterly inadequate for the injury and degradation to him who desires to obtain it. To obtain it he must pass through a day of deep and bitter humiliation. In order to prevent a verdict being given for a trifling sun he must expose the aCts of the adulterer, whoso greatest crime is, that they are secret and committed in the bosom of his family; and he is almost obliged to paTade his shame and sorrow as a mendicant exhibiting his wounds to excite compassion and to draw forth the bounty of strangers. There is another evil arising out of this mode of dealing with a civil proceeding-that it lowers the tone of public morality among u; -that it diminishes the sense that ought to be entertained of the greatest of all offences, which not only strik-es at the very root of all social happiness and virtue, but which is a great and grievous sin against the laws of God. I always feel oppressed with these considerations when I have to detail the circumstances of a Case of this description. I will endeavour to discharge my duty as briefly as possible, and leave to you the delicate and difficult task of ascertaining the damages which ought to be awarded, where there is no standard to apply in estimating them. The plaintiff at tbe time of his marriage was a lieutenant in the 14th Light Dragoons, a regiment then in India, and was aged 25. Ins wife, the unhappy subject of this inquiry, was the daughter of Sir John fittler, a distinguished Indian officer, whose name and services are known to you all. She was at that time o,f the age of 1S. The defendant, Major Croker, had been on the staff of Sir John Littler and was of course a part of his family. His position should have taught him to respect the fanily of his general, and not,by the indulgence tf his passions to being his danghter to shame. The mar. riage took place in 1849, when the plaintiffs regiment was stationed at Lahore. Shortly after his marriago he joined his regiment with Iiis wife, and they continued to live to-etber in perfect harmony and affection during the timue he remained in India. Of course there v.-as not much femalesociety; the principal intercourse was with the wives of the officers of the regiment. I am not able, therefore, to state. the degree of affection which existed between the plaintiff and his wife at that time, but I am able to say that if there bad not been the most perfect harmony between them in sueh a very limited society it must have been known. In 1851 the piaintiff obtained leave to come to England in consequence of illhealth, and he broughit his wife with him. He arrived in England in the middle of 1851, and remtined fora year, residing part of the time with Mr. Brem. ridge, who had married Lady Littler's mother, and during that time there was the most perfect confidence between them. No living children were born after his leaving India, The plaintiff and his wife returned from England in 1852 and arrived in Calcutta in January, 1853, and shortly after his arrived Mrs. Ling was confined at,Calcutta of her eldest daughter, Ada. The same feeling of affection continued to exist between them. Itvwas supposed that the regiment there was about to be ordered to the seat of war, and 1 think I cannot show to you the state of his wife's feelings better than by reading part of a letter written by his wife when he was about to i-ave her and go to the seat of war. (Thelearned counsel then read part of the following letter, which was put in as evidence and read):-

This letter does not exhibit anything like forced expressons - anything like display. It eeem s to be the genuine, simle end natural expression of an affectionate WOMan. The rsgiment did not proceed to the seat of war, and Mr. Linga was ordered to take a detachment to Calcutta~, and whent there was sent home with the detachment.

It shows most completely that criminal intercourse had nplace At that period between thb.m It will be exh ebited toyou. I hava no wish to read it aloud; but it certahy shows that the mind of this unhappy woman must ;ave been completely debauched by the defendant's believig tnat she could receive such ideas and expressions as are contained in that letter. At Corsham the family consisted of the nurse and a young girl named Sarah GlanviL She will tell you that she was mitrusted with various letters to post, addressed to gajor Croker, in Ireland; and after Mrs. Ling had been there some time Major Croker arrived there one morning at 11, and remained with hMrs. Ling the -whole of that day. They dined together, and he continued there till 9 at night, and then went to an inn. On the following day he came to breakfast, and they walked out to-
ether, and stopped at a little inn called the " Ferry -house." arah Glanvil remained outside with the child, and after thy hadbeen there some time they came out of the house, an he went on his way. Mrs. Ling left Corsham some time after this but before she went away she sent the wet nurse with the infant child to Bigadon, and took into her service another girl named GlanviL She then went into lodgings in Eastbourne-te-raco, and remained there a short time, till she removed to No. 4, Conduit-street, Westbourne. terrace. After being there a fortnight Major Croker came there. He had a sitting-room and a bedroom at the top of the house. He and Mrs. Ling had their meals together, and the greatest intimacy existed between them. They were in the habit of taking horse exercise, and Mrs. Ling paid for the hire of the horses, and also for a horse at livery, which was afterwards sent to Ireland to Major Croker. Mrs. Ling also had a miniature of Major Croker. After that time Mrs. Ling left with her child Ada, and all trace of her was lost for some time, when it was discovered that she had removed to 5, Allsop-place, New-road, where she was living with Major Croker as his -wife, under the assumed named of Thompson. They were discovered there, and on a particular day Mr. Bremridge and a party of persons went there for the purpose of identifying them. Shepd Maor Croker were completely identified as the permwho hadbeenliving at Mrs. Wilders, in Conduitstreet, by Dersons who knew them both. Of course, it wouldbeidfeforme to attempt to urge this evidenceas * being clear and distinct proof of criminal intercourse, the
thing is so perfectly clear. I have now brought you down to the point at which the whole evidence terminates, and on which you must give your verdict. I shall have the opportunity of addressing you again, whatever course may be taken by the other side; and I will merely poin.t out to you a few simple circumstances on which to estimate the damages. Here was an union formed under the happiest auspices, at an age when the affections are the strongest and which promised a long life of happiness This prospect bas been broken up, and laid waste by the in-tasion of a man whose former relation to the family of the person who is the partner of his crime should in some degree have made her sacred in his eyes, and should at all events have made hirn carefuly abstain from the indulgence of passions which would bring her to shame and disgrace. You have her children at a very early age deprived of the care of a mother under circumstances for which nothing can compensate, and through a long life before them compeued to hear the name of that mother with feelings of shame. And you have the plaintiff promising himself from his uion all the happiness that life can give, now compelled to recollect that union only with bitterness. These are the circumstances which you have to consider when your time arrives. I will now lay before you the evidence.
Mr. Prescott, clerk to the plaintiff's attorney, produced a register of the plaintiff's marriage, at Calcutta, on the 30th of July, 1845, to Marian Littler. He was then a lieutenant in the 14th Light Dragoons. The lady was then under age.
Colonel Colebrooke, examined.-Was a captain in 1849, and miitary secretary to Sir John Littler, and witnessed the marriage of the plaintiff with Miss Marian Littler, at the cathedral church at Calcutta. Captain Croker was at that time on the staff of Sir John Littler. He was removed on the 12th of June, 1849. The letter produced he could not say was in the handwriting of Maj.;r Croker.
Mr. JAUES admitted the letter, which was handed in to the officer of the Court, but not then read.

I recollect a gentleman caling on Mrs. Ling, who called him Captain Croker. He slept at the Kings Arms' Inn, Corsham. I ave conveyed letters to the post almost every day addressed to Captain Croker from Mrs. Ling. They were addressed to Ireland. I went out on one occasion with Mrs. Ling and her little daughter Ada on a donkey to PrinnelL Captain Croker was with her. They went to an inn into a room. I was with the donkey along with Ada. I can't say exactly how long they remained there.
Cross-examlined by Mr. HAiwN.s.-This took place a fortnight after I was there.
Jane Glanvil examined.-Was 20 in May. The last witness was her sister. She entered Mrs. Ling's service in April, 1806, and came to London with her on the 17th of April They got lodgings at 28, Eastbourne-t-rrace, and from there went, in a week, to Mrs. Wilder's at 4, Conduitstreet. Captain Croker called twice while they were there. Mrs. Ling went to meet him, and he came back with her. They went into the drawing-room. Captain Croker and Mrs. Ling breakfasted there. Captain Croker slept there in the top room upstairs three or four days. Mrs. Lings bedroom was in the back drawing-room. There were fording doors between. Witness slept on the sofa in the drawing-room. Captain Croker came a second time, at half-past
at night, and witness went to bed in Mrs. Ling's bed. She heard their voices in the drawing-room. He st9p ed from Friday to Monday. He got his meals with Mrs. Ling, and spent his time with her. She was discharged by Ms. Ling, in Captain Croker's presence, because she said in the kitchen one day, "If poor people had visitors like rich folks they would be told of it.' Mrs. Ling discharged her, alnd aid Captain Croker was a dear old man, and she *looked on him lie a father.

Mr. J.wse then Proceeded to address the jury for the
defence. He aaid,-Everybody nust feel the force of the re- marks which weresoably,eloquently, anidfeelimgly expressed
to you by Sir F'rederick Thesiger;- and I believe that every person who has; paid attention at'all to this mnatter will *coincide with the opinions which, he has expressed as rto this mnode of seeking repration for suhijre,it-ii.be

The plaintiff, the unhappy lady whos conductis the anb et of tnisintry and the defendant are allexxclided l,ythe PolicYOf orlawfrom giving e-vidence. Youhave therefore to find your way with scanty mateiJ to the result which you conscientiously believe to be just lktween the&prtes. You may have, onx the one hand, shown two on the affection of the wife prevaiiliag and, ro
S dancewhich wuld sbwwhethr the busbn was, 'hrth
I l:elieve, somewhere about the agc of 16 or 17, at Calcutta, in a match most hastily concluded, and it has led, not unnaturally, perhaps, in its result to consequences most painfli, as this investigation proves. In representing Cajor Croker, without making any apolopr for his conductl I shall take your opinlon of facts wbich I sball place before you, under the handwriting of the plaintiff bimself, which wil show you whether heis a man to come and ask a jury of bis country to give him damages for the loss of the affection of his 'wife. Yy friend Sir F. Thesiger, in opening the case, has culled and laid before you somse of his fairest flowers of rhetoric. He wiU wee whether the result shows how inapplicable they are when be knows the truth of the case in the niatter intrusted to his care. You will see whether the plaintiff in this action has a right to come into court to recover damages for the loss of domestic affection, withered by the touch of the adulterer. You will see whether bis happiness has been laid waste. You will see whether the children are to hear their mother's name mentioned with shame and disgrace, or whether it is not the name of the father, after the publication of these proceedings, which they must hear with shame and disgrace. The case comes before you on very scanty and meagre materials. No lady is called to show you any terms of affection on wrhich they lived. It may be that their nicer instinct and keener observation could tell yen in a moment whether that wife was treated affectionately by her husband; and that may ho, as I assume the only excuse for not calling them; hut as address you, you wvil see why they dare not cal them. Now, meagre and scanty as these materials are, let me for one moment in the course of the case follow the narrative which has been extremely shortly opened by my friend Sir F. Thesiger. They were married in 1849. They left India in January, 1855, and arrived in England in August, 1855. Major Croker came home with them on board the same vessel. Major Croker had been known to Sir John Littler, and had been on his staff. It was a hasty marriage of this very young girl of between 16 and 17 years of age. Captain Ling knew well what Major Croker's attentions were, and of the correspondence that was goingon with his wife, as I will show you under his own hand. on board the vessel coming home attentions were paid to MIrs. Ling by Major Croker. I think, if 1 remember rightly, Mr. Macaulay in his most eloquent sketch of the iife of Warren Hastings says that it is on board a vessel, where there is nothing to drsve away the dull monotony of the voyage but quarrelling and love-making, that the deadhest enmities are engendered and the most lasting attachments. Major Croker hadhnown this girl-for she was buG agirl-before. Theyarrive in 1England, and now I wil read you a letter under the plaintiff's owrn hand, which wil throw a light on these proceedings, and which, in the climax, 'wi show you that, so farfromtheplaintiff having to complain of the loss of domestic affection from the foul touch of the adulterer, the defendant has to complain of the plaintiff having himself cast his vife intentionaUy into temptation, and of his havimg written letters urging her on. My friend complains of her mind having been debauched by the defendant. You will see who debauched her mind. They came home at the latter end of August, and the plaintiff's wife went to reside at Bigadon, in Devonshire, with her mother, Lady Littler. The plaintiff was aware of the intimacy and of the correspondence of his wife with the defendant ; and now you will see the materiality of the question put to Mrs. Wright with reference to the box of letters, when you see that the man coming to ask for damages against the adulterer for withered affection is the very man who suggests the correspondence between Major Croker and his own wife, and who
.ent to his lodgings to see whether he had not entrapped him into correspondence. Bet me read you a letter. Let me see whether you think any man 'who values his wife's honour and virtue would have written the letter I now read to you from this man to his rife. It is rritten shortly after their arrival, when he kner of Miajor Croker's attentions to his wife on board the vessel. As I tolndyou before, these cases come very unsatisfactorily before you, and you little kcnow half the tales of cruelty and oppression of husbands in the cases brought bcefore you. Am n ayCub et 9 85

Now, were is a man who actunally writes that letter to his wife while she is under her mother's roof, in which he is not only aware of the correspondence going on between Mlajor Croker and her, but bids her " for God's sake to take care that Lady Littler does not see the letters passing to and fro between them." Major Ling had entered the rkish Contingent and had left his wife at Bigadon, in Devonshire, and nov, when Sir F. Thesiger says the defendant has debauched the mind of the plaintiff's wife, let me read you a letter from Schumla in April, 1856, addressed by Major LiDg to his wife, and then seevhetherhe is a man tocome into a court of justice and complain of his wife's mindbeing debauched. It is true that in January, 1855, she had written interms of affection of har husband; *but the question for you is ho vhas he returned that afection?9 The question for you is, has he degraded his wife and endeavonred to trade on his wife's honour? (The learned counsel then read a letter from the plaintiff describing his intimacy with another woman, and which
account of its gross indecency, we decline topuls) WVVhat think you of that letter? Ay, and on the oth
side they knew of it, and I don't wonder they hv not instructed my friend, Sir Frederifck Thesiger, to open this case properly. And now what think you of his rletorical picture about the injured Plaintiff, and of the man who can write home to his wife and tell her he had actually been in bed with another woman, couched in such disusting terms? She was residing under her mother's roof when sbe received this letter. You may easiy know that this was not the only letter of this kind with which the huxband was polluting his wife's mind. It happened that at this time Major Croker did write and correspond with Mrs Ling with her husband's knowledge. He actually says to her, "write in your correspondence with Major Croker through the army agents." It was true that suspicion was raised in the family of Lady Littler at the frequency of this correspondenee, and when this happened the plaintiff actually tan ht his wife how to correspond with the adulterer, and how to shelter the correspondence from the mother's eye. But more; this letter was written from Shumla, where the Turkshi Contingent then was. The husband's advice was followed, and the wife did correspond. She did address letters to the army agents and conceal the correspondence from her mother's eye, and letters in answer were intercepted and were forwarded to the plaintiff Lady Littler apprised the husband, who had thus written on the lSqth of Ap Prio what was going on by sending him a copy of the letter proved today vwhich Major Croker had writ'en to his wife. Now, I will read to you an account of the manner in which the husband received it; and if this does not show you that this man was not only anxious to throw his wife into x M or Croker's possession, but was anxious aslo to sell her for money, I shall be surprised. We hear in bygone times of men sellng their wives in Smithfield; are there no sales of wives now in more fashionable markets ? Read this letter which this man has written under his own hand-from the man whom my learned friend is instructed to speak of in epithets of sympathy:-

Who is it that has ever counselled this plaintiff to expose, not only his wife's but his own dishonour? But he does it with reference to a divorce ! Sir F.

These letters are discovered afterthe unhappy lady had left her mother's house and she had done whatier husband had told her she might do. This is the outline of case which I shall lay before you. I entertain no doubt whatever no tongue can reveal his conduct to her. She wrote affectionately to him, but he was little worthy of it. She cannot tell you that the man who is appealing to your sympathies for damages for his wounded honour is the man whopolluted and debauched her mind; and who, in a letter which I venture to sayno Syb.trite would have written to his paramour, offers her for 2501. I believe this lady actually pawned her jewels to attempt to make up the money.

t he;3d of March-atiCalcutta. .-e afterwards came--overintheflame vessel with Captain (thed Lieutenantt and MrsLing and Major Croker, arriving in England in September. He obeerved some attentions from Major Croker to Mrs. Ling on the -voyage. There was the same intimacy with Captain Ling. He. knew CAptain Ling's handwriting. The letter of the 29th of September he had doubts about being Captain Liug's. He should believe the signature to be his, but not the writing. Hebelieved the whole of the letter of the 18th of Apil, 1856, to be his. The letterof the 20th of June WaS similar to Captain Ling's writing whenin a hurzy. It was very like it. e believed it was his. He saw his writing every day, and sometimes three times a.day, in connexion with the reginental dutios.
Cross-examined.-Captain Ling was in command of a detachment coming down the Ganees. Captain and Mm Ling were in a boat together, and BLajor Croker in another boat. Captain Ling sometimes went to the doctor's boat. Major Croker slept in the doctor's boat. They were a month going doun the river. Mrs. Ling was large in the familyway at that time. Mrs. Ling was confined on the vofage home, at St. Helena. She vas a long time without appearingon the deck. Captain Ling and Major Croker were on very intimate terms. He had seen Major Croker in Captain Ling's cabin on several occasions. The signature to the letter of the 18th of April was Captain Ling's. The signatures to the letters were alike. Four letters handed to witness by Sir F. Thesiger he believed to beCaptain Ling's handwriting. He was discharged from his duty by Captain Ling part of the vav.
Re-examined.-e was still in the Company's service as staff-sezgeant. He was discharged because of some dispute about rations. He frequently observed the intimacy of Major Croker and Mrs. Ling.
Mrs. Miller examined.-ls the widow of a quartermaster. In 1855 she was at St. Helena, and eme home by the same vessel as Mrs. Ling. She was oonfined the morning sho cmbarked. Her cabin was three or four feet from M's.
hinei. Captain Croker asked her to go in and see Mrs. Ling, she had had a baby that morning. He always lookedtoher comforts at breakfast and dinner, and sat with her in her cabin. Her husband paid her no attention whatever. The vo,yage lasted nine weeks, and Captain Croker continued his attentions to her. Sho bad known Mrs. Ling call Captain Croker up in the middle of the night, and her husband in the cabin, and had known Captain Croker go in and light the lamp
Cross-examined.--Major CroMer did the work of the detachment. Captain ling was lazy nd did nothing himself, and asked his opinion on everything. Major Croker was about 50. Captain Ling ireferred to her too. Major Croker found where she was last week. She was stoppin near Bow Church. She lived at Inversess, and had paid her own expenses so far.
Re-examinedL-She had no interest in the matter. Both gentlemen were exceedingly kind to her. She had a pension from the Government.
Hamerton Carnell examined.-Was third mate on board the Tudor when Captain and Mmrs Ling and Major Croker came home in her. Captain Ling never paid his wife any attention at all throughout the voyage. Major Croker paid her attentions during all the time-no more than a gentleman would pay. He assisted her at dinner table and waited on her.
Alexander Powell examlued.-Was an artilleryman in the East India Companys service, and came home in the Tudor with Captain and M Ling. The three letters read in the ooening of the learned counsel for the defendant were in
aptaiLing's wnting
tCres-examined.-%e hada *certificate of good conduct in Captain Ling's handwriting (produced).
Captain M'Sweeney exammied.-Was chief officer on board the Tudor on the voyage from Calcutta. Captain Ling treated his wife with marked neglect during the voyage, as far as he could see. He treated her with no re ILct
This was the defendant's case.
Sir F. TH}ISIG3 recalled and examined Mr. Bremridge. -He was well acquainted with the handwriting of Captain Ling. The four letters put in by Sir F. Thesiger were in his handwriting. The letter of the 29th of September, put in by the defendant, was not in Captain Ling's handwriting; nor was the second, of the date of the 18th of April; nor the letter of June, 1856. The certificate produced by the soldier was in his handwriting.
F cross-examinea.-ue had seen the three letters produced for the first time now.
Thomas James Laing examined.-Was in the Osmanli Cavalry in the Crimea, and wel acquainted with Captain Ling's handwriting. Not one of the three letters produced by the defendant was in Captain Ling's handwriting.
Cross-examined.-Captain Ling was at Shumla on the 18th of April, W56, and also in June. The signatures to the letters were like his, they were a good forgery. There was a difference in the letter " T." In his opinion the handwriting was altogether completely distinct from his. Witness was brought as a witness to the handwriting. He was attached to the consular service at Aleppo.
Mr. JA?i, on this evidence in contradiction, addressed the jury, and askea if ever on such evidence as this-a case of forgery was rested? Where were the clerks of Cox and Greenwood's ? Where the experts in handwriting ? He would risk the cause on the similarity of the letters and on their contents. The plaintiff was at Shumla at the date of the letter from Shumla, and it was impossble that the whole of the letter and circumstances referred to in it could be a fiction. Where was Lady Littler who intercepted the letters ? Was it true that such a lady as Mrs. C-was at Shumla? Why did not they ask the last witness, he would know. The learned counsel then proceeded to sum up the evidence for the defendant. If the letters were true the plaintiff must have sold his wife. He begged them to look at the letters themselves, and see if they did not contain intrinsic evidence of their truth.
Sir F. THssiGsc:m then rose to reply. He submitted that he must have a verdict.
His Lostuns.-Not if the letters aze true. They amount to leave and licence.
Sir F. THESIGER.-Then the issue was infintely more fearful to Captain LIng than he had supposed; for if the verdict were for the defendant the plaintif must be utterly ruined. The learned counsel then commented on the defendanVs evidence, contending that the attentions of Captain Croker on board ship had by one of his own witnesseseen descrbed as only thoee which a gentleman would pay. The relation in which the parties stood to each other should be borne in mind, and there was nothing, bearing that inmind, in the attentions shownby the defendant on board ship. Captain Ling was endeavoured to be made the victim of a gross conspiracy. Thethree letters put iuby the defendant were nct written by the plaintiff. There was no evidence that themarriage was a hasty one, or that Captain and Mrs. Ling had not lived on terms of affection. They had lived together for months at Mfr. Bremridge's house on terms of affection. It was unfortunate that MIajor Ling could not be called to contradict on his oath the authorship of those letters.
A juryman said, a difficulty as to the letters appeared to him; there was no postmarkonthem.
Sir F. THZsiGEB said, there were not any envelopesproduced. The letters were sprung on them for the first time. If the letters were genuine the clerks of Cox and Co.'s could have been called, who would at once have known them to be genuine. Why had the defendant, who had in his poses. sion these letters, not called these clerks to prove their genuineness? But he had called soldiers onlv to speak to this writing. But he (Sir F9. Thesiger) 'had calle
Mr. Bremridge, who knew well Captain Lings handwriting, and Mr. L.ainr, who was with him in the Crimea, and they had vpoken positively to the writing not being Captain in's. Would they, on evidence such as that of the tvo soldiers called by the defendant, disbelieve the evidence of the two gentlemen he had called, who knew well the plaintiff's handwriting? Where were the envelopes of those letters? They were addressed from Shumla. There was nothing to show that they had passed throu h the post. He denounced them as a icked fabrication. lf there were any intention of fabricating these letters, his wife knew where he was at the time, and might well have supplied these dates, and some of these circumstances. Could they ever believe that a husband writing to his wife would introducej such abandoned, obscene and filthy language? They might have some clue to one ¢apable of suggesting such scenes; for after this evidence be had read a letter, unquestionably from the defendant, intended for the eses of the plaintifs wife, and written from Ireland. We learned counsel again read a part of the letter put in. He asked whether a man who could be so grossly indecent as to write to a woman in this strain would be incapable of writing the letters of the 18th of April, and the Letter of June? He could confidently submit to their inspection for comparison the letters which were uroved to be genuine with thoee put in by the defendant. oelleft it to the jury to sav what damages Captain Lng had a right to exect under the circumstances. The damages they ave
woeulTd an indication of their opinion as to whether Ca tain Ling wrote the letters imputed to him or not.
could not conceive an attempt more abominable to blast a man's character than such a forgery.
His LoDsuis then proceeded to sum up. It was impossible to exaggerate the importance of the case. To thu charge of debauching the plaintifl's wife it was answered by the defendant that the plaintiff was the author of his own dishonour. His lordship then went through the evidence. If they should think the plaintiff guil't of writing the letters imputed to him, he would put it to them whether it was by the plaintiff's contrivance that the Rlaintiff's wife was debauched, and then the
verdict must be for the defendant, for he who was injured by his own consent was not injured at all. If they thought the letters not his, they must consider the damages wrhich such an injury required as the p laintiff had received. In the course of his sUmming-Up his l;ordshipe eressed his strong disgust of the letters put in on behaof the de-
The jury retired, and, after an absence of half-an-hour, returned with a verdict for the plaintiff-damages 1,0001.

obankrupt was an underwriter, of Adelaide. chambers, Gracechurch-street. This was the certificate meeting.
Mr. LAWR"-Cx, for the bankrupt, said he had received a letter from him, stating that he was too ill to be present. Under such circumstances he could only ask for an adjourm ment.
Mr. BAGLEY, for Mr. Digby Seymour, M.P., and other creditors, maid there many 'witnesses in attendance, and he was instructed to ask for a total refusal of the bankrupt's certificate.
Mr. COITLRn,, for the assignees, also appeared to oppose. If an adiournment should be granted it must be at the expense of the bankrupt. The costs of to-day of the opposing creditors must be paid. He was instucted that the bankrupt's absence vvas not caused by illness.
HiS HONOUx ordered an adjournment. No furthei hear ing to be granted, except upon payment of the costs referred to. Protection to be granted only until Friday next, wvith. out giving notice to the opposing creditors.

The bankrupt was the only surviving member in the house of Warren, Russell, and Wright, blacking makers, of the Strand. This was an adjourned examination meeting. Mr. Tinklater appeared for the assignees, MIr. Lawrsnce for the bankrapt, and Mr. Chidlev for creditors.
Mr. LELTE said the bankrupt had received 8,00W. from his father. He had given a very imperfect account of the application of 6,700. of this money. The difference between the two sums, about 2,300., had occurred in the short pedod of eight months, nd was wholly unaccounted for. Although the ssignees did not see how any benefit could arise from an adjournment, theywere at a loss to know how he could be allowed to pass his examination on such accounts. They would be glaif Mr. Lawrance could suggest a mode by which the difficulty could be overcome.
r. Cannan (official agnee) thought that the dis crepancy arose in a great measure from the bankrupthav-
an imcompetent accountant. The business had been camIe on at a loss for some time. The estate had realized 3,200., and a further sum of °001. was espected.
Mbr. LAWRAacE thought that t dscrepancy referred to might be accounted for by the bankrupt's reckless and improvident habits.

Mr. CRDLErr, for Messrs.

The apparatus bad been supplied on the 6th of September last, and during the time that a petition for private arrangement was before this Court. Government had interfered, and by the erection of the apparatus a greater amount of fnes had been saved to the bankrupt's estate than the charge now made.
His Hoious thought, under the circumstances, that the claim might be allowed.

The insolvent was a retired police-officer, with a pension of 35L per annum. He had occupied a small bouse at Kennington belonging to the opposing creditor, and bein tbree years in arrear with his rent. he was sued, to which he pleaded never indebted and a set-off. In consequence of the insolvent pleading to the action the oposing creditors bad been comrelled to try their action at iverpool, when they recoverd a erdict for 55, no defence being made. The plaintiffs' costs were taxed at 58h
The insolvent said the pleas had been put in for him by Thomas Stowell, the informer, who was now undergoin a sentence of imprisonment for obtaining money under fa

Mr. Commlssioner PHILLIPS said the insolvent, with the aid of his friend Stowell, had put the opposing creditors to a very great expense by the vexatious and frivolous pleas, and therefore he would not be discharged until the expiation of six months from the date of the vesting order.

(Beforc tAc RECORDER.)
Anthony Gardner, 28, was indicted for stealing a medal, the propertz of Frederick Brownhall.
hr. Sleigh conducted the prosecution.
The prosecutor was a private in the Ist Battahon of Coldstream Guards, and it appeared that on the night of the 21st of January he was in the Walworth-road, and be assisted to put out a ire, and afterwards wentto a pubHchouse to have some refreshment. Hethen left, and the prisoner, whowas in the publichouse, was seen to follow him with two other men, and when he had got a short distance he was knocked down, and the medal he had received for his services in the Crimea was snatched from him. The prisoner was taken into custody on the following morning, and the medal was found in bis possession.
The jury returned a verdict of Guity.
An officer of the P division informed the Court that the prisoner was the constant associate of bad characters, but it appeared that he had never been previously convicted of felony.
He was sentenced to 12 months' hard labour.
Daniel Yee, 34, was charged with a similar offence. Mr. Cooper prosecuted.
The prosecutor in this case was a man named George Costello, a private in the Royal ArtiHlery, and it appeared that on the night of the 9th of January he and some of his comrades were on their way tc Woolwich, when they were attacked by a gang of ]0 or a dozen men, and the prosecutor was knocked down and kicked, and while he was upon the grond the risoner was seen to snatch his medal from his breast and nandit to a man who made off with it, and nllothing more was heard of the medal, except that it was stated to have beensold in Petticoat-lane for nineence.

The RECORDEB said it was very cruel to rob these poor Men of the only reward they had received for the bravery and the suffenngs they had undergone, and if the pr
soner had been Fnown by the police he should certainly have punished himn more severely. He then sentenced him to sx months' hard labour.
The prosecutor inquired of the Recorder what he was to do to get his medal restored.
The RECORDER said he was very sorry that he could not help himP but hs had no doubt the police would do all hat lay mn their power to get his medal back for him.

&r. Platt prosecuted; Mr. Metcalfe defended the prisoner.
The prosecutor, it appeared, was a ship's steward, and, according to his statement, he went into a publichouse in Whiteebapel, where he saw the prisoner and some other men and treated them, and one of the men offered to v him a lod ng for the night. They then left the pubHlchouse, anahe said that when they had proceeded a short distance Oe WaS Eeired round the throat and knocked down and robbed of his money. The evidence of the prosecutor was, however, of a very unsatisfactory character, and he admitted that he must have been'very drunk at the time, and to-day he also appeared to have,been drinking.
Mr. METOALT7, on behalf of the prisoner, said he was instuctedthatthere was no pretenoe- for the chage of obbery, and that; the truth was that the proseCutor was beast!y drunk, and fell-ibout and hurtt himself, nm tne confused istat of his mind he fancied that acme one had robbed himn, and he isaid his impression was that a great many of the -cases of what were caled

The jury returned a verdict of Not Guily.
W' ia Soayer, 315, a respectable-looking ladi pleaded Guilty" to four mndictments for forgery'.
The prisoner, it appeared, had been for 12 months in he 'ervioe of Mfr. Bourne, a warelhouserilan in Alesae-tet san his father h been for 33 years in thesame servi It appeared that recently a number of forgea checks
boen(prented to the prosecutors bankers, Smith, Payne and ., and for a considerable time no suspicion was entertained as to who was the puity party', it being, bowever, clear from the excellent maanner in which the forgeties Wterp executed that they were the work of some person well acqluainted with the prosecutor's signature and the mode in which his business was conducted. At length it would appear that something occurred which led to an inquiry respecting the prisoner, and it was ascertained that he had been associated with very bad characters, and that he had purchased a gold watch and other expensive artieres, takiDng care, hoWever, not to let the articles be seen by hi; father, so as to avoid suspicion, and there was no doubt that he was the person who hid committed the forgeries, and that the5o articles were the proceeds.

tBrfore the CoMox-SunRjz-rU.)
Henry Bdchert the tutor who upon Friday, in the Third Court, wasfound guilty of libel, came up for judgment.
The Co xosr-Scu.Tw Mu, in passing sentence, said the inlademeanour of which the defendant stood convicted was a very wrious one, and he did not believe that he (the defendant) was fully sensible of the nature of it A legal difficulty arisng out of the way the defence bad been brought bcefore the Cortprevente evidence being giren to trove the truth of the allegations in the letters which had been sent. Even haathey been proved true, that would not have served the defendant, for the rules which had been aId down for his guidance clearly showed that the alleged irregularities arose out of some neglect upon his part. If they were true, or he beieved them true, defendant bad concealed them from Dr, Clements, which ws another violation of the trust reposed in him, and then came the worst part, that the defendant had only disclosed them to gratify an rin-feeling which had arisen in conseruence of Mr Clements conscientiouly refusing to give testimonials of his good condnct. In large establishments it was impossible for the master to attend himself to everything, therefore prsons having the very high trust reposed in them which, in this intance, there was In the defendant ought to be most careful in the performance of it. The apology made was a reparation due to Mr. Clements, and he was bound to
'hat the irregularities complained of had not been proved neither did he believethem to have existed to the extent etated, and that if there had been any M£r. Clementa was not personallyresponsible, but that they had arisen from a breach of the trust reposed In the defendant. Under the act of Parliament the defendant was liable to imprisonment for one, two, or tbreeears; buta tking into consideration the apology which had been made, and that defendant was not fubly aware of the character of the offence committed1 he thought the ends of justice would be met by ordering him (defen nt) to enter into his own recognizance in 100. and two surees in 501. each, to come Up for judment when called upon.
Joehua Gordon, 40, vocalist, was indicted for a misdemeanour.
Mir. Cooper and Mr. WEnteer prosecuted; and Mr. Ribton defended.
It appeared that some time last November two persons named Louisa Walford and Henry Tuck were taken before the police magistrates at Clerkenwell, charged with robbing a foreigner, named Nuremburg The principal witness against them was Alfred Edwards, a boy who touts for the low coffee and lodging houses about,the Eustonsquare station. The case was committed for trial at the Widdlesex Sessions, and the boy Edwards bound over to appear on the 8th of December. On the Saturday evening preceding that date Edwards was standing near the Drnumond Arms, Somers-town, when the prisoner, who obtains a living by singing about at publichouse3, came up and asked him to have something to drink, which he did. They went into several publichouses, where they met some of the friends of Walford and Tuck, to whom prisoner said, "This is the boy who is going against them, but I do not mean to let him. He then took the boy to several other publichouses, and, having made him very drunk, took him to bis own house, were he kept him all night.

GUILDIALL-D&vid Thomas Sadler, a commercial traveller in the emplovment of Messrs, Crowder and Garrod, was charged with embezzling about 4001. belonging to his masters.
Alderman WIBz said the evidence at present adduced in support of the charge was insufficient to justify him in detaming the prisoner, who was therefore discharged.
George Dixey was brought up for further examination before Alderman CusITT charged with stealing 100 dozea pairs of French gloves, 20 dozen shirtfronts, and other
othe valno of nearly 200, the property o Messrs. shent, cKlroft, and Co. of Wood-street, Cheapside; a nd
Hoa ulme was cniarged with feloniously receiving the oods in question, knowing them to have been stolen.
Thne prisoners were remanded.
Wiliam Holtaway, an elderly man, of diminutive stature, was further charged with embezzling 3,1001, the moneys of his masters, Messrs. Hyde and Co., stationers, in Pleetstreet.
Mir. Wontner appeared for the prosecution, and Mr. Hobler for the defence.
Alderman CuBiTT said he could not see how this matter could he treated in a criminal manner. Mr. Hyde treated the prisoner's first deficiency as a debt, and continued him in his employ, and by allowinghim time torepay the amounthe had made it a question of account between them, which, if the prisoner had hadthe means to settlewvouldhsave prevented the case from ever comning into that court. Hie sould only look upon the prisoner's deficiencies as one coatinuous tranSaCtion, which Mr. Hyde had treated as a debt, and whuch he should not be justified in dealing with in any other light. The prisoner was thereFore discharged.

He was flogngthe poor animal, which wasevidentlyin extreme puan an in a Fitiably weak condition; it rtight, indeed be tralysaidthatitwasgoinguponthreelegsonly. Witnesscahed out several times to defendantto stop, which he atlength did in Stanhope-street. The horse was there examined by him (the officer)2 who found that it had been severely cut inside the thighs, m addition to which there were numerous weals upon the legs and other parts. Defendant when asked by witness why he iltreated his horse, replied that the animal was stubborn, and that he was trying to beat it out of
Mr. Wemyss said, that the worst conditioned horses were generall taken out for night work. The greatest cruelties imainaa le were practisea by the working of lame and near y starved animals.
Mr. to?G having heard somo farther particulars, and begin fully satisfied that the casewas one of extreme cruelty, fined the defendant W0s. and costs.
Shortly before the closing of the court about 150 men came up from the workhouse to complain that they were out of work and had been unable to obtain assistance.
Mr. Tubbs,the relieving offlcer, said that the whole of the cases had been inquired into agreeship to the instructions received by him from the hoard of guardians and directors, and in the course of the day he, assted by others
belonging to the establishment, had relieved nearlly 4,000 persons.~ ~ ~~~b thr
Mr. Loxo said that he had not the means of relieving the partiesapplying to him; and Mr. Tubbs had an understanding with the leaders of the party with regard to the day upon which they were to apply again at the house.
They then quietly went Away.

LA~ME1Th-The investigation of the charge %ainat Richard Smith, in having caused the death of William Keeffe, alias Peoker, ozi boxing-tiRtit, was resumed before the Hon. G. C. NORTONT at I.mboth Polioe Court, when, in aLddition to the evidence already produced, the following testimony was given :-
Mr. John W. Laird, of Nto. 6, rinhopsgate.street Without, said that on Christmas mormm be put up a carriage sad pair of hor6es at the E3dinburgCastle Tavern, Peckham Me, and left them in charge of the prisoner. He calledtjsere on the following morning, and observing that the prisoner had got but one arm he thought him incapable of attending properly to the hores, and seeing a man in the front of the bar, whom he since understood to have been the deceased, he offered, to give him 2f. if he attended and assisted the prisoner in doing up the horses. He did not recolect seetng the prisoner at that time, nor did hehear ny words of an angry character pass between them. On the Saturday morning he called and took the carriage away and did not, then or at any ether time, notice any blooI in the stable.
Mr. NoBToN.-It has been given in evidence that on your entering the stable on the aturdy morning you noticed blood there, and that on your speaking about it the prisoner sad it had been caused by two dogs fi htig there,-do you recollect anything of the sort passing.
Mr. LslrL-No, nothing of the sort.
Mr. NoRToN.-Do you recollect the deceased saying that unless he had the whole of the money for attending to the horses he would take none,for that he should have the whole of the work, and the prisoner the whole of the pay ?
Mr. Laird.-I do not recollect hissayingso, but hemight have said something of the kind.
Mr. NomRy.-Are your horses generally qiet ?
Mr. Laird.-Exceedingly so. Indeed, I doubt whether they hnow how to kick-; at least, I never saw them attempt it.
Mr. NoBrON.-But, I suppose if anything fell at their heels, they mrit kick out?
Vitness.-fell, it is possible.
John Ioys, of Nunhead, Peck-ham Rye, deposed thAt about 8 o'clock on boxing-night he left the deceased in the taproom of the Edinburgh, and on going there between 8 and 9 on the fellown mer he heard that he was very ill and in the stable 1o1K nd he went to him and found him lying there veri bad, with a deep wound in his head, and on asking him "ow he did it he replied, " I must have fallen between the horses' feet, for when I came to I found myself ther." There was a quantity of dry blood on his face, which witness washedo£f and at that time he connidered that it was the hores that had caused his injuries. The deceasd said he was so bad that he thought he shonld die, and witness procured him some coffee, which he gave him.
Nr. NORTON.-Did he teU you how he got into the loft? Witness.-No, he did not.
Mr. NoRToN.-Did It not occur to you, seeing the extent of his in3uries, to ask how he got up the perpendicular ladder into the hayloft ?
Witn6ss.-No, it did not Sir.
Mr. NOBrTON.-Had you Leard any quNrrelling between the prisoner and the deceased on boxing-night ?
witness.-Not quarrellmng it was mere chaing. Mr. NORTON.-Btate what it was; state all.
Witness.-Well, Sir, hey were in the taproom together and the prisoner said "That Pecker has served me a nice trick, I gave him something to help me, buthohas been away all day drinking, and has notdone a stroke of workfor me ," and Pecker rephed, " No, nor will I do any more work for you; for I've done quite enough for you for nothing." The prisoner then said, "IIll have him out for aScot." He did not think Smith (the prisoner) was angry, but the deceased appeared excited from drink. ne (witness hew the deceased to have frequentlygot over the yar gates, and slept in the hayloft of the stables, to his onv know-
Marmaduke Cartwright, a gardener, said,-On Friday, the 9th of January, I was in company with Mr. Steel on myway to this court, when I met the prisoner and on my tlling him I was coming to hear the case between Mr. Bubble and Mr. Pope, the omnibus proprietors, he said he should wish to come with us, but Pecker had sent for him, and he was going to him to the workhouse. I then said How did all this happen topoor Pecker ? and he replied, "I must not open my mouth too wide, because people may think that I am in it. I had the keys, and let him into the stable between 11 and 12 o'clock, and on going to the stble between 5 and 6 the next morning I found Pecker between the horse's fore legs with a great wound in his head, his collar-hone, three of his ribs, and two of his fingers broken." I asked him what bad bronght him to the stables at so early an hour in the morning and he said it was to do up the horses. I asked why, on finding the poor man in such a state he did not go and get a medical man to attend to him i and he said because Pecker did not consider himself bad enough for that; and he took him to the loft. I asked him how he, with but one arm, could get such a person as the deceased up the ladder to the loft ? and he replied, " You don't know what I cau do with my dummy." He said that after placing him in the loft he went on cleaning his pots, and that hearing the deceased groaning about 8 o'cloc he thougbt it best to tellMr. Davis, the landlord, and he did so.
Mr. NORTON.-Are you sure he said Mr. Davis; because Mr. Davis himself has stated on his oath that he heard nothing of the occurrence until he returned from town on Saturday night ?
Witness.-I am quite certain he said Mr. Davis,
Mr. NORTON.-Eave you anything further to state ?
Witness.-Only that on the prisoner's parting with us Kr. Steel remark-ed "1If that poor man dies youx may denend upon it that man (the prisoner) will get into an awkward mess."
Mr. Steel, the person referred to by the last witness, corroborated in every particular his evidence, and, when asked by the magistrate why it was that he had made the observation repeated by the last witness, he replied that it was m consequence of nis manner, and his several times repeating in the course of the short conversation the expression that he must not open his mouth too wide lesthe might kimself be suspected of being concerned in it.
Jamas ihomas Wood, the coroner's officer for the parish of Camberwell, said,Lhat on going to the Edisibrgh Castle to obtain somo information about the death of the deceased he saw the prisoner, who pointed out to him the mode in which the deceased had got over the yard gates on the night in question, and also said that the deceased had
ot up the ladder leading to the loft, himself, after receiving This being all the ovideuce, satatement was handed in by Inspector Silver, written to the prisoner's ditaetiod, in which many of the represen tations were different from those made by him to the witness.
A solicitor, who attended for the prisoner, submitted that no jury would convict on the evidence given, and therefore prayed for the discharge of his client.
Mr. NORTON remarked that, after the testimony given by the two respectable witnesses, Cartwright and Steel, and the evidence of Mr. King, the surgeon, that he did not think it possible that a man with such serious injuries could himself have gotup the ladder to the loft-an op*inio
which he must say he (Mr. Norton) himself fuDy acquiesced in-as well as the extremely contradictor/ accounts given from time to time by the prisoner himself, he did not think that he should be justified in disposing of the case without further inquiy, and he should therefore remand the prisoner to aLnother day,.moermndtepio
Mr. GeorgeFrodsham, the chronometer maker in 'Changealley, Cornhill, and whose private residenco is opposite the Swan Tavern, Stock-well, &peared before the M on. G. C. NXRToN,to be discharged by de course of law for an offence of which he had been guilty on the Tuesday night preceding, and for which offence he, from some cause or otber, bad neglected to appear before his worship on the following

Sir, -In your journal of this day, referring to the late xase of " Parker v. Shadwell," you make somie very just obzervations upon the laxity with which plausible characters -of departing servants are too commonly given by their employers, and then you cite me as an instance of this most reprehensible practice.
I agree with the spirit of your remarks but you are wrong in your application of them. While, With every wish to De impartial, you give the words of my cross-examination-viz., "I gave him a character,"you do not seem to be aware that the Court would not allow me to state what the character was which I gave, -for the charaeter was in writing, and the writing was mot in court. I could not give parol evidence of the contents of a written document. It is your own inference that -the character so given was a good one. That is altogether a mistake. The fact is, that as soon as I discovered the robbery which had taken place at my house I forwarded information of it to Mr. Smith, to whom Parker was going, and I earnestly advised Mr. Smith not to let Parker enter his house. This is the only character whioh I gave, and if Mr. Smith chose to take Parker into his service he did it with his eyes open, and not through any recommendation Qof mine.
I have only to add, that I am, your obedient servant.

Sir,-My attention has beenl called by lions. " Studer" and 31on!. " Rutteni' to an error which has crept into your :report in condensing the evidence taken yesterday at Marlioroug:h:street against a man named Denis.
By tilns report it appears that theso gentlemen purohbed. t'e stolen .-rticles from the prisoner, whereas, in fact, they declined to p,srchase them.
The eidence- given by the witnesses was very long, some in brokea English, and soxneo through an interpreter, which makes it surprising that-yoirreporter was able to catch the purport of the eviden, 0 saccrately as be has done.

Her Majesty's sailing frigate Diamond, Captain C. B- Hamilton, arrived at Spithead on Saturday from the Mediterranean; she left Malta on the 4th of December, and is 24 days from Gibraltar. She experienced a very rough passage. On the 20th and 21st alt., off Cape Finisterre, she fell in with a heavy gale of wind from the N.E., which lasted 11 days; in this she carried away her main yard, nd threw overboard her six upper deck guns, the ship labouring heavily with a tremendous sea. She brought home 11 supernumneraries from Malta, and.one from the Carlew at Gibraltar. On Thursday last, in the Channel, she spoke the ships Koh-i-noor and the Grand Trianon, both outward bound. The Diamond sailed yesterday morning for Chatham, to be paid off.
The old 50-gun frigate Conquestador, having undergone the necessary alterations and repairs at Woolwich pier, is this day to be removed by the Dockyard Department, and moored in Erith Reach, to be placed at the disposal of the Ordnanoe storekeeper, for the purpose of a floating magazine.
The Admiralty yacht Vivid, Mster-Commander Allen, returned to Woolwich on Saturday from special service, in conveying the late governor and family from Jersey.
The paddlewheel steam sloop Vesuvius, having completed repairs and received new rigging, is ordered to be removed from Woolwich basin, to be placed in the first-class steam reserve at Sheerness.
The Northfleet freightship, of 1,200 tons burden, arrived at WVoolwich on Saburday in the service of Government, and commenoed shipping a heavy cargo of 13-inch mortars, battering guns, shot, shell, ammunition, artillery waggons, and other war stores for China. The freightships Wynard and Menagan, in the London Docks, are likewise chartered for the same purpose.
Reductions on an extensive scale are ordered to be put into execution in the Government Department at Woolwich at the end of the present financial year. In addition to the dismissal of the various clerks engaged as extras during the late stress of work, the services of the whole of the temporary clerks, a number of whom have been always attached to the establishment, are ordered to be dispensed with. With a desire of corresponding with the rigid instructions of economy which have been issued, about 2,000 artisans and labourers are likewise to be discharged at the end of March -namely, 1,000 from the Royal LIboratory, 500 from the carriage department, and about 500 from the storekeepe's and the gum factory departments. Reports are current to the effect that the majority of the Artillery officers employed in superintending the departments of Woolwich Arsenal are to be superseded by civilians experienced in the duties of the departments, the services of the military officers having been demanded by the Commander-in-Chief Other important changes are likeewise to be made in the store branch of the War Department, which will add greatly to the efficiency of the establishment. Many of those who are advanced in life are to be allowed to retire on the superannuation list.

Tweed Fishery Bill.
TWZEPD FISREYBy BILZ.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I observe in the number of the QuasrterlyBvietew ust published an article on the salmon, containing the following statement with reference to the bills now before Par-
iament for the regulation of the Tweed fishinga:-
"' The clause apparently reckoned next in importance in the new biU Is one suppressing two kinds of nets at present in use-one caUed 'stel nets,' entirely belonging to the lower proprietors, and the other calld ' cairn nets,' belonging chiefly to the middle and upper proprietors. The evil of the stell nets is not so much in what theykill as in what they frighten back; in short, they act more in the way of obstruction than of destruction. Taking into account that, though thus generally mischievous, they are not particularly profitable; that they are only about a dozen in number; and that, perhaps, a majority of the lower proprietors have no interest, but the opposite, in tneir mainte nance, the demand, we should think, is not likely to be very powerfully resisted."
I have no intention at present of raising any argument as to the polcy of using the nets in question, which wiU be effectualy discussed before a committee of the House of Commons; but I am unwilling that so gross a misstatement of facts as is contained in the above extract should appear in so respectable a journal as the Quarterliy without immediate contradiction.
Instead of these nets not being particularly profitable, ssveral of the most valuable fisheries in the lower district of the Tweed depend almost exclusively on the " stell net ," and on all the fisheries (with very few exceptions) in and near the mouth of the Tweed, and extending along the sea coast, the same net has been used from time immemoria, andl a very large propo:tion of the samonI in these fisheries is taken by it.
Finally, I positively deny that " steU nets" frighten or obstruct more fish than they kill, or more toan any of the other regular nets used on the Tweed; and, instead of no powerful resistance being made to their abolition, as the reviewer intimates, I have the best means of knowing that the proprietors of the lower or commercial waters of the Tweed will unanimously resist by every means in their power the attempt now being made by the sporting proprietors to deprive them of a considerable portion of the legitimato produce of their nets, not with a view to the preservation of the salmon for the general benefit, but merely to give to the owners of sporting waters an increased supply of fish for which they give no equivalent.

FOUNDIlING OF T AITA S-TEMu .-The particulars of the fcundering of the Anita steamer, belonging to the MLsgdalena Steam Navigation Company, five hours after leaving port, and the loss of 12 of her crew have been made known at Lloyd's. A few years since the company was formed for the parpose of developing the trade of the Magdalena river and other rivers, and steamers of a peculiar build and of a light draught of water, in order to navigate the rivers, were buiit on the Thames and sent ont. The Anita was one of them; she had been out three years, and for some reason the steamers of the company were ordered home to England to be sold. The Amta, in company with the Estrella, a similar description of vessel belonging to the company, left Savanilla on the 23d of December for London; she lbad not been out to sea more than two hours before it was discovered that sho had made a formidable leak, and all the efforts of the officers and crew failed in reducing it. Unfortiinately a strong gale sprang up with a heavy sea, and the gevere labouring of the vessel hastened herfoundering.

The Manchester Education Scheme.
-THB MANCHEBSTER DUOATIONScHEMR.
A public meeting was held in tho Free Trade Htal, itanchester, on Friday evening, cofiveled by the tentral Comnmittee of Education in Manchester and Salfotd. 3r. T. Ba4ley, chairman of the auiimlttee, prexided, and there were present the Right Ron. Sir J. S:Palungton, Sir 5. P. Kay.
Shuttleworth, Messrs. W. L. Wood, 3. A. Nicholls, D. Raude, T. Clegg, W. Entwisle, the Rev. Canon Richson, and many other gentlemen of inflaenoe.
The C EnR having briefly opened the proceedings by pointing out the immediat necessity which existed for the settlement of this great national question,
Mr. IL W. Smiles, the secretary, read a large number of letters which had been received from members of Parliament and friends of edacation, and among them two from Lord Stanley and Mr. Cobden, which expressedhearty concurrence in the objects of the meeting, and regretted that previous engagements placed it beyond their power to aid the cause vith their presence on that occasion.
Mr. WILM EYTtisvz, in moving the first resolution, expressed his regret that so much tiae had beten lost in the settlement of the great question of education, even in Manchester. This was to a great extent due to the differences in religious opinions ; but it must he admitted that the obiections and scruples urged on this ground were rather of a theoretical than a practical character. He did not beleve that those for whose benefit the school-rate was principaUy intended entertained such scraples as were often represented. (Hear, hear.) He did not altogether sym. pathize with the scrnples frequently raised by those who would have to pay to the school. rate, but would rather look. primarily, to those who were in danger of being bred up in senorance and, conse9uently, in nisery. He would especiaUy ao this in a community like Manchester, where there were so many schools connected 'with different religious bodies, to 'which parents could send their children to be instructed In the particular form of faith which they pro. fessed. (HIear, hear.) By the mteasure wfhich Was about to be introduced into Parlianient the promoters of the Manchester and Salford Education Bil would secure all they ever asked for. All schools that already partook of the Parliamentary grant and that were duly inspected might place themselves in union with the district school committee, upon the termns prescribed in the bill. Provisior Was also made for the admission of what were called secular schools, provided that aftor inspection the masters were certified to be competent and the schools to be properly conducted. There was a wide difference between this plan and that formerly proposed by the National Pnblic School Asso. ciation, whose proposal was to build and support public schools out of the rates, without making any provision in the first instance for the admission of those schools which already existed in connexion with the various religious con. gregations of the community. Boomw as now made for the admission of all schools upon similar terms. He was not an enthusiastic admirer of the secular system, but he did not conceive that there was such an inherent defect in it that Christian men, holding pecauliar religious opinions, could refuse to mix themselves up with it. At the same time, he did not think the system would prevail to any great extent throughout the district. He concluded by moving:-
Thkalthough Parliamniet,balwn ecaiaingnso the C-ommittee ogf cotmci on nMAucation,he caftin tpea ntsof Fity of additional efforts to extend and improve national education, and has sanctioned the principle of making direct payments out of the publio funds in aid of the education of chUdren sicording to their school attendance. it fis the opinion of this meeting that the pr~ovibus of xtheondirniteteoof.CWouDcndonEdueatisonluareino adequatetO the natfonalvanes, and that in oantng direct aidfor educational parwes the amountthoe uch aid, tracto which it should apof, and

Mr. W. B. Wron seconded the resolution, and asid that all which the friends of this scheme of educaton asked wag that the general instruction which children of all denominations received in common should be received by them in common, under a common master, that the children of different faiths minglng together might learn to kno one another, might form common friendships, might meet on common ground in those matters which they could learn in common (hear); while those upon which the Al. mtightyhaddecreed that men shouldform different opinions might, with a due regard forthe sacred rights of conscience, bedxearnedy evey child from the instructions of its own religious denominaton in accordance with the wishes of its parents. (Applanse.)
The resun tion was carried unanimously.
The :nev. Canon RICeBON, in moving the second resolution addrzessed himself to the removal of a frequent statis. thcal error. He said that in all recent discussions upon education the stistics of school attendance had been adduced to show what had been done by voluntary and reli-
gious efforts. Attendance at Sunday schools and day schools 'was equally brought forwvard. He did not deny the im. portaneeof Sunday-school instruction, which was absolutely indispensable(atpplause); but the system was capable of improvement. There were few who would desire either to secularze it, or aLlow it to supersede day-school instruction. Therefore he would confine his remarks to day schools. It was said the increase in the attendance had been as fol lows:-In 1818 it w as 1 in 17e26; in 18331 in 11e27a and in 1851, 1 in 8-36. According to these igures, the attendance had doubled since 1818. Those who a leged this increase ought to attach some importance to the truth of their statements; but, although they wore made on the authority of the registrar-general, two statements out of the three contained in them were notoriously, palpably, obviously untrue. In the "Digest" relatng to 1818 many schools were admitted to exist, of which no account was taken. Of Manchester and Salford it was said that the poorer classes were comparatively wel supplied with educaton since the national and Lancasterian schooLs were ereated, and that 21,000 children were educated; while the returns, which extended to the surrounding chapelrmes of Ardwick, &c., named only 4,334 day scholars, and 10,144 Sunday scholars, which tegether did not make anything like 21,000, so that it was clear thete must have been considerable error. In the Mj,anc,19 a uardinfe of May 5 1821, there appeared a letter signed "X. HI.," and written by the present Mr. Alderman ShuLtleworth, complaining of th misstatements respecting theo number of children undoreducatlon as stated in the " Digest." Of the returns of 1833 the Leeds overseers observed that theirs were as correct as they wore able to make, a number of conductors of both Sunday and day schools having neglected or refused to mako returnsl* those of Birmingham were defective; those of Liverpool defective and delusive; and in those relatn tm tanchester the manchester Statistical Society detected a deficiency of 181 schools in this township alono; in Yorc, 3 in Bury, 19 and in five tow ns only there was a deficiency of 34,ed0 scholars. Withthese defects, it was perfectly absurd to compare the returns of 1818 and 1833 with th aeose of 185L Yet, not many years ago, a minister of the Cabinet endorsed these inadccurate statements; and last year a right hon. gentleman who opposed their excellen' faiend (Sir J.
ahlclngton) had recurse to them. These average calcuLations were ordinarily made t show how urnecestary it was for any effort to promote public education at the public expense; and MIr. Edwvard Baines, of LJeeds, arrived at the -conclusion from them that if 349 more children were at school in Mfanchester and Salford there would be as many as could be reasona,bly expected. How far AMr. Baines was correct he would leave those who knew^ Manchester and Salford to determine. Even the average of 1 in Sin 1861 was an aggregate made up of pro portions varying very greatly indeed,. But if any fair basis were taken from the returns of 1834 to compare them with those of 1861 he believed it could be proved, from the increase of population, that the ratio of school attendance had decreased from 1 in 10 to 1 in 13. The value oE these averages was explodied by the ans'wer of Dr. f'errow to the Parliamentary committee, that they representod the division of a certdan number of years, but not of a certain amond t of education, He begged

Mlr. J. A. NICHOLlJS moved and Myr. C. E. CowrzY seconded the third resolution, which was to the effect that while the meeting was not insensible to the advantaes which accrued from Parliamentary grants it was of opinion that such paymeonts ought to be dependeatupon local knoweledge of loca necessiUtes, and therefore ought to be defrayed out of the local rates, adainistered by local authorities, who should be elected by and out of the ratepyers.
Sir 3. P. KAY-SssT.vvrxosrnr, who 'was received with muchapplause, supported thearesolution. He said he had observ th great interest the proceedings of the two committees which had for the lastfive or sis years explored, with singular industry and public spirit, all the greatprni
ples which were involved in this national question, and he observed their conclusion with the greatest satisfaction. He
tokpart himself in the proceedings of one of those com-
othel othe uen mattahent, to netheinvauelfenl prncile of^ domta tohe prceduaions of theUnhes chid;h recognzd all tion CoAmmittee, beca^use he felt that the first thu 4,o b-
clone in relation to public education was to defend the vast fabric that had been created by the exertions of the reli 'ous communities, (Hear, hear.) He felt that it would tare been waste of public effort, of time, of resources, of energies, and of all the highest sympathies and charities of our nature, to say that we would makes one plain tabua ratsa of all that was ast, that the great fabric of edueation in which a rmillion of the children of this country waem confided to its congregations and brou-ht forward in religious truth and secular knowied
shou d no longer exist, and that in the place of years, lie mnight say of centuries of exertion, from the Reformation downwards, all that was done should b ne nmore, and that we would creato in its place some newv sYstem Yet untried. (Hear, hear.) To that he could never consent. While, therefore, he was the last man to desire a centralized power and would defend the right of a parent to direct the-educ. tion of his children at the expense of every other principle, he felt itnecessarl, having all this large sympathy with the proceedings of t e secular school association, to connect nimself with the other committee. The Manchester peoule would recognize the very hoaourable position which gir John Pak"igton had taken in relation to this question (Applaus) It was no longer to be a question betweenttwo great partes whether a Aifniitry should e4ist, because some particlar course wss to be takenas to edeafion, and it wa mainly to the exertions of Sir J.

eordial concurrence last session in the main pdn4ies ana ssapy of the details of 14r4 J4 3lIsDz pwml .as a
tribute of admiration from the right hon. baronet for the factthat no considerable step bad been taken in bringing forwtar measures ariming out of the esperience of the Com. mnittee of Coneil to which the noble lord had not h*nt. the hearty sanction of his reatname andposition. (Applause.) Anc as it was known that Sir J. P1 kington's attentiOn wais in the first insance drawn to those efforts which he had Enoceasfuly nde to bring together the two education cormnittees of Manchester by MIr. Cobden (ap. plause), this meeting ought not to omit to notice the grput significance there vas in the union of those two atesmen, who were seeldng in this great theatre of public and poEtical debate to bring out of the discussion and Inquiries of those two committees some practical condusion. He never had thought himself that thera was any discordance between the principles such as he had already indicated them of the two committees, and he hid had always looked forward with confidence to the dar when they. would find common ground of action such as they haI found at present. (Hear, hear.) But he was not very manginae, from sd experience of the embarsasments to which this question was liable, that even this harmonious combination would lead at once to a complete and happy result. (Hear, hear.) The question of the school-rate was one which would require to be explored and discussed both by provincial and by Parliamentary debates for, perhaps, some years to come. The Committee of Council had mainly direted its attention to the multiplication of the number of schools and the improvement of their efficiency, and in both directions considerable irogress had been made. By a minute of 1S53. which was, perhaps, not sufficiently understood, wherever, in any locality, one-half the expense 'of a school building was raised on the spot, the other half was contributed by the Government. And, as regarded the promotion of efficiency, there were already in the conatry 4,000 certificated teachers receiving aid from Government, and a small army of 10,300 pupil teachers. It was scarcely possible to attach too much importance to the education given to those voung persons. They were appreaticed from the age of 13 to 19 years, they were daily ylve or six hours in school, receiving separate cstracson, and purning their studies in the evening-constantly under tha highest moral and religious gmdance, their whole characters and intellects matured in the highest degree; and that there should be 10,000 such persons at this time in this country receiving such instruction was a fact of great significance and value, even apart from its influence on the schools. (Applause.) But, as the matter really stood, there were 40 training colleges, and a large -proportion of these pupils would enter those colleges, from which would come annually 1,000 teachers, to go out with the aid of the Government to read civilization over the length and breadth of thisland. These measures had led the Committee of Council to consider bow two classes of wants which were not provided for by the early minutes could be reached without any deviation from the principle on which the grants had proceeded. It was a delicate step, but, led by the discussions of the Manchester and Salford committee, he (Sir J. Shuttleworth) had su,gested to the Government the drat application of the capitation grant to the rural districts. The object of that grant was twofold,-first, to aid the poor schools nnable to fulfil the conditions required towards their pupil-teachers; and, secondly, by increasing the annual resources of schools, to give a larger aid towards school building, and afford a more certain prospect of havin
a larger proportion of the resources of the school provided by Government. The Government had stretched to the utmost limit that system of grant in the rural districts, ahd it was with alarm that he had heard Isst summer that the capitation grant bad been extended to the large towns in England. Not that there were not also many schools in those towns to which the capitation grant would be of great benefit, especially in London; for the immediate effect of it would be to raise a large number of schools from a level below that at which they could partake of the grants of the minutes of 1846, and enable them to obtain those grants; and the effect in many of the provincial towns would be the same; but the extension itself was a very formidable measures, and he should very greatly have preferred that it had been postponed, and that the proceedings which this meeting was assembled to conferupon should have taken the place of that extension. (Hear, hear.) If we were to conceive, for example, that tho capitation grant was to embrace the whole of the 2,000,000 of children which by the census we understood were receiving some form of education in this eountry,-and if it meant equal justice it meant that,-then 400,000. per annum would be required for the payment of the capitation grant alone. That was really the decision at which the Government had arrived. And if we were to conceive what, he trusted, was one of the measures forthcoming in the fature, the "half. time' system to be adopted, instead of 2,000,000,, there would be the whole 4,000,000 of children of the school age, between three years and 15, brought to school for half their time. His reason for allading to these facts was to show the value which would soon attach to the labours of the two education comuaittees of Manchester, which had explored the difficult iaths of legislation on this subject with great success. For example, he had the means of knowing that the education grant of this year, without a department of science and art, would amount to 540,000!, and that including the department of science and art it would probably exceed 600,0001. And with the extension of the capitation grant we must look with some apprehension to a ra d increase of Parliamentary grants in succeeding years. nIe did not think he was at all rash in stating that it wasimpossible for the Committee of Council to proceed with its presentadministrationwithoutavote of 1,000JOOOO. withinthreeyearsfromthistime. ceeonfessedhe sawin the too centrazed administration of this Committee of Council, as of other departments, at endency to one of two evils-a too great rigidity, by which corruption was prevented, or a too great laxity, by which the public money was squandered. While he was in office he preferred the rigidityto the laxity, and hence probably some of the disfavour with which be understood the roceedings of the Committee of Council had been receiverin the country. It was also dangerous to proceed too far in this system of centralization m administration of so very large a fund as that which was intrusted to the Committee of Council threatened to become, because it was assuming functions which he could see no reason for not localizing, or committing to local agency, He saw no reason why the whole should not be adnlinistered as intended by the bill prepared by the combined Manchester committees. We could not, however, advance far in this path without encountering again the opposition of voluntaryism to legislative interference. There appeared always to have been two opposite errors-one assuming that the Legislature could do everything, the other denying that the Legislature could do anything. We could scarcely fail to perceive around us the advantages of the administration of the grants of the Committee of Council, and on the facts connected with the school-age alone he believed it would be possible to show conclusively the necessity of legilative interference. (Cheers.)
The resolution was then carried nem. con.
The Rev. Dr. M'Kzmnow moved the fourth resolution -
" That although, in the opinion of this meeting, it would be unjust in administer-ing any local rate, in aid of the scbools bailt by voluntary effort, to interfere with the management, dacipline. instrction, or inspection of such aschools, otherwise thian to secure the speacsle object, of such aid. yet it would be equally unjust to disregard thec oonscIentious feelings of parets inx respet to the religious education of their children, or or the ra^tepanyesInr"8Untespet etlhoi dcto theirpyegrfrmso relgion to which therobject. therefo e this meeti condiders that the onay requirement certainiger a whiche a a ondit of receising such local aid, ought to be denaded, is a prescibed mt pount systec onesucationd, andt the " religious Instructionfoughtytobe managers but that no cha d ought to be a ompeled tolearn sdiemingtive religious foreuldry to which hi, prent boanrentiowey objecto.
The Right Hon. Sir J. PAxnf tyOws- seconded the resolution amid loud cheers. After a few prefatory rentarks as to the fitful and precarious nature of the present system of education, d the "religions difficulty that impeded anything like an organized system being resorted to, the right hon. baronet went on to say the result of this long-felt difficalty was the formation of the party known as the secular party, the head-quarters of which he beieved he might say had existed in that great city. (Hlear.) While on the one hand all the religious deuominations had insisted upon their children having the blemssags of religious education, others, equally anxious to disseminatethoseblessigs, felt that s impossiblewas itto reconcile the denominations andto bring them into co- operation for the training of their children in the same schools that it would be better to banish relgious teaching fromn the chools altogether, and to establish schools upon a soecular ystem. Atnd what was the secular system 7It had already been remarked that It had been greatly misunderstood, and euch eas undoubtedly the case. (Iear, hear.) An impression prevailed in the country that the secular party was opposed to giving religiousinstrxudtion to the youthof England. Was there such a party in existence ? (Cries of "No, no.") He believed there was not. If there was a party that would deprive the youth othehe country of that first nd greatelt point of instruction, and that believed it wraspo ssible to train realy good men nd good citizens without impressig upon tha youthful mind the all-importance of religion, with that party he had no sympathy-with it he could have no communion-and with it he would have no united action. (" Hear, hear," and applause.) But this wals not the character of the secular party. If he rigwhtly u nderstood the meaning and objects of that party, what they said was this:-" We value religions instruction ,as much as the advocates of a religiou s system, but we con-
tend that for such teaching the school is not the place, and the schoolmaster is not the man." (Hear, bear.) The difference, then, between the so-called secular and religious parties was not so much one of pzinciple as of time, manner, and place. (Cheers.) Previous to his visit to Manchester in November he received a communication from Ihat distinguished man to whom reference had already been made-he meant Mr. Cobden-suggesting to him, ashewould have an opportunity of communicating with the leading members of both the educational bodies in this city, tounder. take the'task of putting an end to the unhappy differencs, and finding a common ground upon which all might unite. When he proposed a conferencey in consequence of what was suggested by Mr. Cobden, some three or four gentlemen were deputed from each side. On the day after he delivered his address, they met in conference; and he was not going too far when be said that this great difficulty, wich had- puzzled and perplexed England for years, and which, again and again, had been pron.ounped to be insuperable, was solved by seven or eight getentieen in a discussion that did not occupy two hours. (Applause.) The ground they had taken was founded upon the principlo of religious freedom. The basi they had ad'pted was as simple as poble. It was that hereafter the conductors of ever school should teach'religibn as they thought right; that there sholid be no interference with the teachin of religion acoorditnto their belief, save only the indispen6able re4tuirement that no nianl' onoiecnde plsould beilolated. but thatthemuostperfect tespec should be had fo the religious scruples of every prent whose cbild or childten mixlt atteiin the schooL (Hear, hear. He believed in hig conciencenthat theplJan whichby thii hill they wereabout -o meoommeld to the adoption af the Le&lature =wa mg
which every friend. of education-the most rigid secularist and the most religions andconscientions clergymau-nigiht conscientiously and cordially adopt. (Hear, hear.) Bnt he might perhaps be allowed to give a word of counsel to each side of the now united party. Tohissecailrfriends he would say that if they trusted to the Sunday school and to home teaching for the religious instruction of the school children his belief was that in the one they were trustiog to what was not xuBicient (hear, hear), and that if they trusted to home teaching they must be thinking rather of I the homes to which they themselves belonged (hear
hear) than of those comfortless and too often wretche( homes from which the children of the humbler elasses came to school. (Hear, hear.) To the other side he would may that their religious teaching would be utterly thrown away -that they would be sowing seed in an unproductive soil-unless the secular teaching of the schools of England was raised to a higher standard than It had yet attained. (" Hear, hear," and applause.) The right hon. speaker, after paying a high tribute to Mr. Cobden's exertions in the great cause on behalf of which they were then assembled, and referring to the many political questions on which it had been his fate in public life to differ with that gentleman, went on to say that he could see no reasonwhy he should not co-operate with those who were oVposed to him in Rublic life when they could meet upon this one great question, which onght not to be the subject of party difference; and, while be saw no reason agAnst it, he saw this strong obvious reason in its favour, thit, whether they looked to the effect in Parliament or in the country, the *moral effect must and would be great of seeing men of opposite parties in public life casting aside party watchwor s and party entanglements, and consenting to ct together for a great object which aU parties deemed important in its relation to the welfare and wellbeing of the people. (Cheers.) It was therefore Animnated by these reasons that they were about to introduce a bill the history and objects of which had been explained. It wasincomplete, eadmitted; Permissive, notcompulsory local, and. not general; but in the [present state of public feeling the part of wise politicians was to gain what they could, and if the measure was not extensive they must remember that the principles it involved wecre all-important. (Hiear, hear.) Let them once have those principles upon the eatute-book, and he predicted that it could not, would not, be long before the operation of them should be extended over tue whole country. What were those principles? Did thepeople of Manchester value religious freedom Then let them sulpport the system under whuch every school should be free to choose that religion which the conductors thought right, and under which no man's conscience should be violated. Did they value the principle of local self govern ment? Then let them support a measure which would confer the administration of local funds upon aloy and would resist the centralizing tendency of administring a gigantic fund by an administrative department of the Stat. (Creat cheering.)
The Rev. Mr. PxxcAs t supported the resolation, which was carried unanimously.
ME. T. P. BUV2cG moved, and the Rev-. W. GASRn;r seconded a resolution, reguesting Sir John Pakington and Mfr. Cobden to persevere m Parliamnent with a measure for the promotion of education based upon tho principles of the resoltions, w hich was also carried.
The Rev. R. E. BROOKE and the Rev. J. IL PArTEMSON having addressed the meeting, the proceedings terminated with the customary vote of thanks to the chairman.

London Destitution And Its Remedy.
ILONDON DESTITUTION AND ITS REMEDY.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I have carefully perused your able leader on the opinions of the Bishop of London and Mr. Gladstone with respect to the claim which the poor in the easterm districts of London have upon the sympathy and charity of their richer brethren in the west. With the principles enunciated in that article I fully agree. But I would suggest that something more than the charity of the rich is required to meet the chronic destitution which always prevails in the winter season in this locality. It is impossible that tens of thousands of starving labourers can be efficiently relieved by the spasmodic efforts of even the most extensive charity.
If the Bishop in the House of Lords, or Mr. Gladstone in the House of Commons, would introduce and carry a bill to equalize the poor-rates throughout the whole of the metropolis, these poverty-stricken districts would be materially relieved and the guardians better able to cope with such difficulties as those which are now weighing them down. The average poor-rate throughout the kingdom is about 2sin the pound per annum, here we are paying 5s. for poor rates alone, besides other parochial charges equal to is. in the pound more. If this suggestion were carried out, all the xich would be compelled to contribute, vhereas by the exerciso of voluntary charity it is only the liberal and the humane who render any assistanceat alL Tho Metropolitan District Visiting Association, to which the clergy and poor of the distressed districts are so deeply indebted, is almost the only systematic effoit which has been made to express the sympathy of the rich with the poor, and the contributors to its funds will be surprised to learn that the whole of it3 income (about 4,000L) is not more than equal to one farthing in the pound on the poor-rate assessment of thoso parishes which partake even most liberally of its assistance. The fundsof this valuable association ought to be at onco materially augmented; and if the peace of London is to be preserved intact, and crime prevented from advancing to inordinate lengths, it behoves those in authority to devise some plan bywhich the burden of the poor-rato may be equalized, and the indigent tradesman relieved from being the chief contributor tothe support of the starving labourer.
More than 100 families in utter destitution from wanL of work have applied to me personally for relief during the present week, and many more to my district visitors, and we have no means adequately to relieve their urgent distress.
I enclose my card in accordance with your usual rule, and am. yours. &c..

The Chinese Quarrel.
THE CHrNESE QUABREL.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-As one for many years intimately connected with China, I thank you sincerely for the manly and sensible view you take of eventsat Canton.
I appeal to aU who at any time resided at Canton whether the Viceroy has not ever since the last peace systematically siolated the conditions on which it was granted.
Ingress into the city has been denied, heavy transit duties have been exacted inland on our imports, the population of Canton has been encouraged by their Government to annoy and insult us, so as to make it utterly unsafe to show ourselves where by treaty we have a right to be.
Dr. Bowring, when he left our shores, was a disciple of the peace-at-all-price party, yet he found it impossible to keep the peace in China, and I willventure to say if our Government disavows Governor Bowring, hushes up matters, and prevails on Mr. Cobden himself to be Governor of Hongkong, he wMil be at war in China even before Russia is crumpled up.
The British and foreign merchants connected with Canton are heavy losers by the stoppage of the trade, many have lost house and home; nevertheless, as a body, they approve what has been done, and insist on the Chinese Government being compeUed to observe the treaty. The vast majority of the population of China are with us, and long for free intercourse with other nations. Their Tartar Govern. ment dreads it, and does aU cowardice and cruelty can devise to prevent China entering the family of nations. With such a Government, in spite of what would-be philanthropists and peace-at-all-price men may twaddle, one course only can and must be adopted-viz., compel them to do what is right.
I am. Sir. your obedient servant-

Cruelties On Board American Ships.
CR UZLTIZS OA 0BOABD AM_ERIC4V SH*p#
The following is a special report from the mana Dg cong mittee to the members of. the liverpool Society oft -zieDS of Foreigners in Distress, idopted at a meeting held on t 4th of February, 1857-
"Ever since the foundation of the'Liverroel SO cet
Friends of Foreigners in Distress, i 1851, the Attention oC the committee has repeatedly been called to the suffering, inl icted upon foreigners by the system 3n force at some nt the ports of the tJnited States for suppl*ing the Mneri4a mercantile marine with saLlore. A large portion ot the Ze_ source s of the society bas been applied to the relief of thqp victims of this evil system.
" But the evil has reached of lhte to such a rnagnjtut.s
and threatens such rapid increase, that the comtmittee consider the sphere of their action ooit no longer to be confined to the granting of assistanceto the sufferers, but that. it has become their dutg to appeal to the authorities of bc, countries, in the hope that steps may boe 3taen toaQa&thx* evil at ib root.
"Hundreds of poor men of all nations are annualy oau. among us from the cause mentioned, in an utterly wretoUchd
condition, not only destitute of money and clothinW, but t6xaoften in a ruined state of health from the revolti USAg
they receive on board the American vessels. Some oflithnx have been carried off by force or stratagem, leaving behindt parents, lives, and chlildren; ethers aro enticed by the, promise of lood vwages; and the great m&ioritv are turse& Away entire y destitute on their arival ingian&
"These aro grave eharges, and the society must of course be expected to substantiate them; with this view the committee have extracted from their books a list of CUM. which they have examined dtLrinz the last year; they amount to 79, and since the beginning of the new year they have already had 27 cses. Only 37 of these have shippd eo their own accord, while the renmaining69 had been brounght over against their will With two exceptions, they all complained of having been repeatedly and grossly assaulted anl ill-treated during the voyage, and the fact that 82 of theia
were either obliged, on their arrival, to bo sent to thehospital, or otherwisereceived mediclassistance, asuficlently. corroborates their complaintg.
" All sorts of contrivances, it appears, are resorted to as
New York to obtain seamen for the Amnerican packet. ships; for instance, the New York shipping agents adver. ise in English and in German for IyoUng 3en 2 nee* not have been at eea before to work as deck labiersatf fixed wages;' under this pretext they are decoyed on boar3* and when once there they are retained by force, Other*engage of their own accord as ordinary'seamen, cooks, carpentems &c., hut are alike deceived; e thers ag. ar en* ticed into publichouses, miade druink, ad thu beItray Oma
.uses,~ ~~~ and usn . e
beard. lt is on record that maany have been offerN worlc. on board a steamer in the river, or to uiload shipe, and ar
thus prevailed upon to step into a small boat to be carriedt on board, which Ieaves them aS soon as they are put on thedeck of the ship, where they are retained forcibly.
" Amosg the applicants for relief there have been coopers.,
capentes,cooks, waiters, clerks, and surg;eons, who haverbeen carried off in this nefarious way. v cry soon, aftenthey are on board they are robbed of most of their effects,; nd there is no redress to be obtained; their remonstranmce are laughed at or answered bY ill-treatment, and the samet means are employed to force them to go aloft and to do all that able Mleu are expected to do.
" Tho cruelties which ae practised upon these por tn.
protected mnen on board these ships would be incredible', hadthey not been of late freuently confirmed by the pro. ceedings in the Liverpool police court; but unfortunately in redress for these ferocious assaults, committed upon the high seas, there is no practical remedy for these poor men on their arrival in this country. It has been Proved inthat court that on board of the Ocean Monarch mien have been forced to drav with their teeth iron nails from the deck, into wvhich they had been driven for that purpose to thedepth of two inches - that they have been compelled lite. rally to lick up the aust from the deck of the cabin floorand at,* the in quest held upon a Dutchman who had beeii beaten to death by the third mn ate and the boatswain of thet Guy Mannering, the surgeon who nmade the post morteen examination deposed I'that the head presented an enor. mously contused mass, the face was completely battered in;' and there were from 70 to 80 contused wounds upon thefeet, legs, thighs, and the back.' The hospitals ofIlivere pool record many instances of the lamentable condition irt
which the majority of these victims of savage ferocity arebrought in.
"It may, perhaps, be pleaded in extenuation that these men ship un er false pretences as able seamen, and that; when they are found on board to be only landsmen the officers feel so annoyed aud disappointed that they give vent; to their vexation in iU-treatment. Although this woulh! form no excuse whatever for the barbarous crueltie% practised, yet even this will not avail; for the shippina masters who are employed by the owners to procure a crew. and who must be supposed to enjoy and to retain their con. fidence, are perfectly aware of the condition and the ouality of the man tney engage at the wages of S20 and $1v per mnonth; moreover, it is stated in a recent case heard in the Liverpool Court that two Germans and a Frenchman wh% were decoyed on board of the Albert Gallatin, when tha crew were mustered on deck, were objectod to as not being on the muster-roll, and were proposed to be sent onr shore; the first mate, however, prevented this being done, stating that he would rather have these threa foreigners than three seamen already on the roll, no doubt thinking that the former would prove the cheaper men, it being the practice in all cases that have been brought before the society, including the one in question, to trn off such unhappy fellows on their arrival without paying them anything. Of the many cases which have come under the notice of the society it would bo difficult to fin!l any men that could have passed themselves off as sailors, their outward appearance rendering it impossible for them to impose upon the practised judgment of a seaman or ship ping master.
" It is, however, but justice to exonerate the majority oE the captains from any participation in the actual ilitreat ment. This has been generaUy practised by the matesE boatswains, and crews.
" That such a system is fraught with the most dangerous consequences to the shipping interest must be self-endentan incompetent crew vwill always endanger the safety of a vessel,-but it is in behalf of humanity that thesocietylhave taken up this subject, and in thatbehalf they plead forciblI earnestly, and urgently that the proper authorities shoul
devise means for putting an end to a system which by Its barbarity and cruelty must prove a disgrace to civilized nature. "By order of the committee,

Court Of Common Council.
COURT OF COMMJON COUNCIL.
On Saturday a special court was held for the purpose ofreceiving a report from the Corporation Inquiry Committee, to which body it had been referred to draw up suggfstions. relative to the future management of the corporation.
The attendance of members of both courts was unusually large.
Mr. WooD said the committee had had an anxious desire to perform the duty confided to them with the utmost degree of deliberation and consideration to meet the circum, stances in which the corporation was placed. It was desirable that the Court should be of a unanimous opinion, or an nearly so as they could, upon the important matters con. tamed in there port It was satisfactory to him to think that during the last year much had been done by the Court} itself to remedy evils which formerly existed Thepor would inform the Court that a desire existed en the part of the committee that further amendments should be made irc the constitution of the body. He had for many years beea of opinion that it was the duty of the Court themselves ta take the initiative in the line of reform. (Hear.) Let themr now seriously review their position and carry out what; reforms they could, and then ask the Legislature to assist them in effecting the rest. If the Court were of opinion that the report should be printed before it was discussed he should feel it his duty to yield to the adoption ot that course. He now moved that it be read.
Mr. WOODTHORPE then proceeded to read the lengthy report, which contained 50 suggestions, some of which wera that the number of wards should be reduced to 20; that the Parliamentary franchise should be the municipal franchise; that the number of common councilmen should bei reduced to 150; that the quoram of the Court should be 30; that the term of the office of common councilmetr should be for one year; that the Lord Mayor should ha elected by the members of the livery companiesn together with the municipal electors from the aldermen who had served the office of sheriff; that the sheriff should' be elected by the same constituency astheLordMayorthat the Lord Mayor and aldermen shoald be magistrates a.
at present, and have the administration of justice in thes nfice-rooms, and continue to be eommissioners of ther Central Criminal Court; that they should have the control of the city prisons as well as of the prison officers; that they should exercise the same duties in respect to the police xa they now possess; that they should stiUl have the appoint.. ment of the recorder and other law officers; the alder. men to assemble at a Court of Aldermen for mgis4 terial purposes, and for tho nanagement of the charitien. and other trasts in their wards; that there should be no. alderman without a ward constituency, and that thiat
arrangement should not affect the aldermen at present holding office ; that the aldermen shall present to the. Court of Common Council quarderly estimates of their proo bable expenditure for each next ensuing quarter, as well as quarterly aceounts of the sums actuaU pid for magisterial parposesin each last preceding quarter The Lerd Mayor not eo have the power of breaking up the court, and in the absnene of the Lord Mayor the CouLrt to appoint a member ta preside. The Lord Mayor nottohave the rliege of going uprtothe throneasasePate court,but onvy as formingoart of the court of Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons. Tha Lord Mayor and aldermen not to have the licensing ot brokers, which is to be done by the Common Council; that all exclusive rights of tradin in the city, shaU be abolished; all street tolh to e abolished, c.' Te report; concludes by expresing an earnest hope that all dfferences of opinion between the two Courts wiU be re. moved by the adoption of the sgestions therein enume. rated.
Mr. WOOD moved that the report be agreed to.
Mr. H. L. TAmroR said that the report ought to be con: aidered calnly and dspassionately, an that it ought to bel prlnted forthwith, anda copy of it sent to each member ot the Court. (Hear, hear.) He therefore moved, as are amienament,-
`Tbat theo eport beon=te and that the eonlderation of It bqo i,vstoned tilthe nextCot. (HIear, hear.)
