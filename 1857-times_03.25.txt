The Directors have ranch pleaeure In announcing the receipt from St. Petersbnrg of official copies of the documents confirminog the in. teUllgence of the suoesefat termination of the negotiations with the Imperial Russian Government relative to this railway.
In conoequenoe of the many advantageons changes which have been made in the length and route of this line, in the construction ot the architectural workst, and In the relaxation of some of the origina reStictive stipulations the Directors have been enabled to accept a rednction in the fixed capital and thns materially improve the prospect of futuire dividends.
The term of the oDncession has been extended froma 56 to 75 years dating from the opening of the whole tine; during which period the ComPany will enjoy tke Profits.
The lImperial Geovernmcent bas naot resered to Itself the right to purChase the tine during the term of the soncesson.
The terimas anow arraged e' able the Directorstosubetantiate the original representation of a, minimium interest of 5 per oent. upon the re uiedcaDta ;and the tecmns of the contract for the constructico of he in asaprovd by the engIneer-in-chief, leav such a margin &a to justify the Directors in anticipating an inicrease On that per teitage.
The Company in not required to account to the Imperia GovernMent for ita expenditore, but the guaratee aDPples to the fixed capital for 75 years; hence any saving in the cost of the works enhances the value of the guarantee. This, however, is of less Importance, inasmuch an the result or a more careful erminatlonof the traffic eonafrms the exPectation of dividends far beyond it.
The shares will be reduced from Â£100 ho Â£20, or 100 francs, or 121 sliver rubles ench.
The calls wil be made over a period of thre yeaars; the larger por. -tion fi,ling neon the second and third years
The Caiptal authorized by the Irajuezlal Rtusian Government includes A sumn granted for the payment of interest during construction.
Interest at 5 pier cent, per annum, will be paid on calls until the opnng of the line.
Duge noti ce will be given of the necessary arrangements consequent upon these alteration, as soon as they have been decided upon by the Directorso

Therein, HUs Exrcellency Lord Harris in his degitch ho the flocretsryjof Staem for the Co'onics sy-'Tilthis Islnd, from the niature of Its soil and theo formation o ita land, appeas to be particularly adapted far such undertakings, and, moreover, that thsy are absolutely nercasay to develope iteresourvos;" and further, Shlone and beUleve that, by asgisting toe introdudiln of railroads here you willoonfer a lasftig enefit on thecolony."
While somne other West Idia Colonies have been in a state of prostrastion or decline, the trade of Trinidad has been and is constantly imProving. Of the eight years enaing in 1854, as apipears by the Parliamentary Returns, %toe exports of te las tshow an excess over the fiest of from 00 to 70 per cent. Judging from the latest reports, the improvement still continues, and there is good reason for believing that, vwith the aid of railroads, it will he accelerated at a rate that wil
soon raise this L-land to the ranik of the most flourishing of our depen. denciem The pre-cut financial condition of the Ilanmd, also shown by official documents recently published by the ColoRial Government, and the punoctual liquidation of all the liabilities of the Colony. afford asmnle assurance that perfect reliance may be pleced in the faithful fulilment of any engagement entered into by the Legislature with re-
spect to a guaLrantee.
Between 1845 and 1847 certain influential parties connected with the Colony formed a CoDmpany for making railwaysin z the island, and their PreParatory efforts were eminently msuccssul, hut the Commercial and monetary crisis which subsequently occurred compelled their abandonmentoftheuridertakizig. Itianowsuggcesethatthe chief portion of the required capital may be supplied with advantage by parties unconneCted with the Colony, and thus an additional element for the devon inept, of Ito resources anud benefit to the railways be introduced.
The l.rivilsees at that time conceded by the Goverrnment were,A gua-antee ot 5 per cemi.
A grat of Crown lainds to the extent of 1,000 acrus far eveym ile of railway constructed by the Company, on oDndition of one-third of their Price, when eold, being paid into the Colonial Treasury.
The timber on the land so granted to ba the excltusive Property of the Company,
The miinerals to be als the property of the CoGmpany, subject to a T~he Compan to bare the righbt of cutting timber fromn the Crown lands for toe construction of their works until the laud to be granted to themn shall furnish sufficient for the purpose.
The Directors are in communication with the Home Government, and these terms will be regarded sas a basis for future negotiations, except in respect to the rate of guarantee. A correspondence has also been opened upon the subject betweenrthie Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Trinidad Government, aud it may be observed that in 1847 these conditions were referred by the Colonial Minister. EArl Grey, to the Commissioners of Railways and, after a favourable report, a co r was trantsrnittedby his Lordship to the Directors or the Ceylon Reaway Compary as having been agreed upon withi the Trinidad Railw%y Company, and as showing what the Government would be willing to concede to the Ceylon Company. TheF have, buweTer, Ilively obtained a guarantee of A per cent., and applicationi has now been made on bebalf of thiszComipany for a similru advantage,
The Legislature of the Colony having recently passed an, Ordinance authori7ing the issue of debentuires at 6percent., for the purpose of encouragIng the formation of taramroads In the island, Iis cn onfidently anticipated that the gnamutee of O per cent. for these railways wil be resdily concedEd inasmnuch as their coDnstruction will, to areat extent, supersede t6 enoces ity for tramaways, and the Colony wMCongoquentlycoDlybe Pledged to acontingent luplace of anabsolute lility&:
while, onaths other hand, such tramnway., if constructed, wll act as
feeders or branches to the Company's lines of railway and it is in tended Iby this Company to incorporate in their undertafring if deat rable, such lines Or tramway as may be sanctioned under t5he above ordinance.
The llnes which It I int the first instance proposed to constrct wfll Comprise about 50 mIl escoverin2g the principal sugar-rowing dixtriccu of the island, and brivging them into connexion with the shipping placeson the coast. In carrying outthese works arran3gementswill be moade so as not to Interfere wilh the labour on the plantations.
The Local Committee in Trinidad. in 1845, furuisbed data, upon which estimates were made of the probable traffic of the several lines of railway; these exhibit, at lowr rates of charge, a net revenue averaging 11! par cent. The trade of the colony and the Ppopi%tion havinig considerably inareased since these estimates were framed, the prOspect of ampl renu are of course still greater.
Itiis itendd shortly to despaetkl to tbseCoony an engineer, with an agent on beh..lf of the Company, to assist the Committee there fin determining the course and extent of the lines to be constructed, and the accuracy of these estimates for the guidance of the Legislators and the Shareholders, and also in repect to the groundsa for a guarantee,
The Board of Directors were honoured with an interview by his Exoeellecy Governor Krate, the present Govermor of the Island, and explained their Intention to subject the above estimates to futrther in-

To the 3.NDEL'END)ENT ELECTORS of the BOROUGH of
GREENWICH.
FROM thestrongly expressed opinions that may be
Fhearmd otnhall sides as to the necessity of rescuing oar representation from the control and jobbery of an individual, coupled with the wishes conveyed to me personally and by requlaitioug. I feel that I can no longer hesitate to accept the confidenice You a'e willing to repos in me. I therefore beg to slate that, in obedience toryoar wisher. I now offer myself as a Candidate to represent you in the Commons House of Parliakment.
In consenting to contest the representation of ouir Borough' on the present occasion, I sincerely hope that none of my fellow-townsmen. not even my opponente, will imagine that I do so froma any motives of personal ambition or vanity. my solo object is to vindicate the independenice of the Borouxgh, and rescue ths. nomination of one of yur repreesuntatives, atleswt, from the control of an Individual. Theelc tion has come upon us so soon, before the independent party was suificiently orgaulved and beforo we had time to secure the services of a gentleman worthy in every respect to represent us : but as soon as ouch a candidate shall be found, I ehali only be too happy, should I be elected Your representative, to retire and give up Into his abler handa the truest, unimp ice and untoarnsed, which you will have been pleased to repose in me.
horn and bred among you, every page In the history of my life has be sentra bylu,~d anid you are therefore well able to germ year own Jugeta rw your own conclusionas as to what wil be my conouct hereafter. That MY interests are identical with yoir own. and that I should exercise due vigilance to proteet them more energatically than any strangercould do. you mustfeel assured.
My political opinions havrebeen lately so well canvassedua to render any exposition of them here unnweesary.
As a stench and unflinching espporter of the ballot, an unweorving advocate of the gradual and progressive extension of the suffrage ; a steadfast upholder of the great principles of civil and religious liberty, I am kniown to you. The cause of law reform would find in mne o sluggard. But in all measures for political and socal imnprovement that may be brougbt forward. I trast you will eve find moe an ardent lever of that glorious Constitution we have Inherited, and under wheec protecting esbdow we have grown up Into strength and freedom.
A thorough reformer of those defects and blemishes that may retard the full and beneficent development of our political and social system, I am no lee a jealous Conservative of all that Is good and wisely ordered therein. I would enrol mnyeelf under the banners of no party, but every good measure would have my honest vote.

The roadgroud onwhich I rest my appeal isthat of faithfully rePresntig te vewsandPrinciples of the Liberal party, and sympathizng ordallywit th Progress of civil and reglgons liberty.
I shre wat i maifestly the general feeling of reget throughout the contry,that ard alereton has been duiven to a premature disoluionofPariamntby an unnaturaol combination of partits. It imycniton ta he in entitled to the gratitude of the people of England for his vigrorns and efficient Admninltration.
It would be my desire, if elected, to rmote, such niensures as may tend to the improvement of our social syttem, especialy by the enlargement of the ounstituency and the advancement of education,
To an Aemlninltralion that would strenuously exert themselves for the settlement of tho church rate question, I would give my hearty Mih a sincere attachment to the Church of England. and to those great Prostestant nuncipies established at the Reformation, I would gladly Eee erased fromn the Statute Siook all civil disabilities on account of religious belief.
It in hardly necessaxy to ray, that I should support a well considered economy ini every department of the State, and suich reforms in our civil an3d military services as recent circumstances have shown to be necessary.

In reference so the p resent Government, and the qretiUon on which Par'liament hag beea diwsolved, I wish to remark that Lord Paimersten took the belm at atime when others shrunk. from it, and carried us triumphantly to the conclusion of a war into which the country seemed to have " helplessly drifted:' and, believing the present Prime Mlinister to possatss, in an eminent degree, the well-merited confidence of the nation, I shall not hesitate to give to his Govemnment a cordia, though wholly inctependent, support,

Lreadinfluential number of the Liberal electors AbLarge aonedme the honour to request that I will allow myself to be Put in nomination as a caudidate for this division. of the county At thie apDrosching General Election.
A ecitr of uPwards of 11,000 voters ignificantly points to the fact. that. inal future elections for South Staffordshire, the voles of the
pnutW ortioni of this great community must have weight in the choieof to members ; and that the electors are prepared to assert the principle that from among the productive class one at least of Ita reocreseutatives must be chosen.
It 13 on this ground that I have been induced to respond to the flattering and pressing invitation which has been made to me.
If a long and intimate conuehion and an extensive acquaintance with the industria pursuits, together with an active paLrticipation I
the public business of this great and Important dietrict, constitute na quelif cation for the dlischarge of the grave duties which attach to your RlePresentatlve, I veniture to hope I may be found not wholly unfitted for the cube. At the same time I cannot conceal from myself the fact that the efficient discharge of those duties demands miore of strength and activity than I can tripe for any long Period to enjoy.
To my opinions I used hardly refer. A Libesal-in the large and generous sense Of the terM - t have for many yers identified myself extensively with the great political movements of the Midland district. and efoe te eecton bunantopprtuisywill be afforded me of

Ttegsdxy Even&
The quotation of gold at Pa;ns is about 6 per miMe premium, and the short exchange on London Is 25.25 per fl sterling. On comparing these rates with the English Mint price of 3. 1s. Lodo per ounce for standard gold, it appears that gold is nearly 3-lOths per cent, dearer in Paris than in London.
By advices from Hamburg the price of gold is 424 per mnark, and the short exchange on London is 1 3.4k per 11. sterling. Standard gold at the EnIglish Mint price is therefore about 1-lOth per cent. dearer inl Hamburg than in London.
The course of exchange at New York on London for bills at 60 days' sight is 108k per cent., which, when compared with the Mint par between the two countries, shows that the exchange is agaiust England; but, after making allowance for charges of transport and difference of interest, the present rate leaves no profit on the transmission of gold either way between England and America.
The English funds have been steady to-day at the closing prices of yesterday, the market presenting an appearance of firmness greater than could have been looked for under the prevailing pressure for loans. Consols were 'quoted 93i to J for money, and 93i to i for the 8th of ApriL lndia Stock left off at 222 to 224; Bank Stock with dividend 220 to 222; India-bonds, 4s. discount to par; Exchequerbonds, 984 to 99 and Exchequer-bills (March) par to 3s. premium.
In the Stock Exchange to-day, owing to some deliveries of stock, money was in much demand on Government securities at 6 per cent., anid some considerable advances were obtained from the Bank. In the discount market also there was great activity.
Foreign securities were rather heavy, and Mexican was again unfavourably influenced by sales. In Turkish and other descriptions few operations took place. Mexican for the account were dealt in at 23k,i, 23, and 23k. Turkdsh Six per Cents. for money were negotiated at 98, and for the account at 97i and 98. The other transactions includedBrazilian Five per Cents., 1024; the Four-and-aHalf per Cents., 97j and 98, Chilian Six per Cents., 105k; Peruvian for account, 771; Portuguese Three per Cents. for the account, 45; Russian Five per Cent&s, 107; the Four-and-a-Half per Cents., ~97 and 98k; and Dutch Four per Cents., Certificates, 99.
In the foreign exchanges this afternoon there was no alteration of importance from the rates of last post.
The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 70f. 65c. for money, and 70f. 75c. for the end of the month, showing in the former case a recovery of an eighth.
There were no withdrawals of specie from the Bank to-day. The arrivalshave been 4,8851. bythe Brazil steamer Tamar, 6,8351. from the Peninsila, and 61,0001. from New York,-the latter, most probably, on French aCcount.
The commercial advices from New York this week describe a further improvement of about one per cent. in mcst of the principal railway securities. Erie were quoted 58 ; Reading, 82 to kI; Panama, 96 to i; and New York Central, 91 to J. Ilinois Central had receded to 137k. The general firiness of the market was attributable to the Bank return for the week, which showed an increase of 210,0001. in specie. As the new tariff is not to come into operation till the 1st of July it may have the effect of delaying the resumption of gold shipments to this side, since the importers of European goods will restrict their purchases as much as possible up to the period when they can be brought in at the reduced duties. 'With regard to the rejection of the Mexican treaty by the President, nothing was known at the time of the present mail closing, the news having been subsequently telegraphed to Halifax. The same also was the case with respect to the ratiication by the Senate of the Central American treaty writh Englnd. Certain amendmnents appear to have beeumtroduc,n and it remains to be seen if these are such as to affect its value. The United States' steamers Niagara and Mimissippi have been ordered to proceed to England to assist in laying the Atlantic telegraph. The Niagara is a screw propeUer, and is said to be the largeat steam vessel of war in the world, while the Mississippi is the mcalt powerful paddlewheel steamer in the American navy. The English Government, it was understood, intend to furnish two ships of similar character, the two propellers being designed to receive the cable and the paddle ships to attend them. As soon as the cable is received on board the four ships will proceed together to the middle of the Atlantic, where the cable in the two propelers will be united and submerged, the English vessel paying out one-half tiU it reaches Ireland, and the American vessel the other half till it reaches Newfoundland. inteUige-nce had been received from New Orleans of the completion of the carriage road across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Among the biLs lost in Congress at the termination of the session were all those for subsidies to new lines of steamers, including that between Valparaiso and Panara. The State Legislature of Missouri have adoptedl one of those conatitutional amendments which serve. as pitfals to incautious lenders of money from this side. The State debt is never to exceed 6,000,000L, and consequently, if in future years of excitement capitalists should forget this clause and make loans to a larger amount, they wil be told, when the hour of payment arrives, as in the recent case of California, that the people who have received the money caunot, without a new vote, legally recognize any obligation upon it. A company had been announced in New 'York for the raising of the Russian ships at Sebastopol; but one of the papers advises the Russian Government, as some of the directors have been notoriously concerned in bubble schemes, not to pay money in advance.
At a meeting of the Bank of Egypt held t;o-day, Colonel J. Oliphant in the chair, the report and Iaccounts were unanimously adopted. Thc proposal of the directors to carry forward the balance of F profit, and to refrain from making a division until
the expiration of 12 months from the commencement of operations, was immediately approved. The Chairman stated that the progreas1 of businews is satisfactory, and that the returns for January and February show a large increase of profit compared with any siilar period of the previous six months. There was a total. absence of bad debts to the 31st of December, and the liabiitv incurred through the recent failure of Mesr. Franghiadi Sons will be comparatively smalL In the item of preliminary expenses of 10,1941. is included 7,5001. paid to Mr. Pasquali for services and expenses incurred in the original formation of the establishment, remuneration to temporary officials, and charges for commission on shares. In answer to questions it was stated that the privileges enjoyed under arrangements with the Egyptian Government are of the most extensive description, including the issue of notes; and that the trade of the country through the facilities of banking will be greatly developed. The management at Alexandria is in the hands of Mr. Pasquali and another wellqualified officer, who cannot enter into any extensive operations without the cognizance of the Board. A shareholder urged upon the directors the necessity of caution in vestig powers in managers. At the Close of the proceedings it was arranged that Mr. a
Hartley, one of the Directors of the Peninsula and
Oriental Steam Company, whose connexions with the Pasha and the trade of the locality are of an
important nature, shall be added to the Board.
Another meeting wvill be calledimmediately after the accounts are completed to the close of June,
when the results, it is expected, will be satisfictory. The following IS the balance-sheet:

It is statedl that XMesr Dodge, Bacon, and Co.,
whose suspension was announoed on the lOth inst., bavnng .determitied on leaving the liabilities which thevg ha incurred as agents to be protected and provided for by their principals (all of whom are understood to be perfectly able to meet their responsibility), havo resumed paymentof their regular trade liabilities and engagements.
The weekly reviews from the Ansterdam and Botterdam produce markets state that although business was less active prices continued to be supported. The operations in coffee had been limited, sugar was firm, and some descriptions showed a tendency t. frther advance. Tea and cotton presented a steady appearance, but the operations had diminished. The letters from Rouen mention that the market for manufactures was without animation, but that it was expected the purchaes for Easter would increase.
It is stated that orders have been received to discontinue the surveys about to be made of the two or three vessels engaged to oonvey troops to China. The impression is consequently entertained that, instead of troops being despatched direct from England, troops will be removed to that destination from Persia.
The Petropolis, of the Hamburg and Brazil line of steamers, which left Southampton for Lisbon and Brazil on the 27th ult., put back to Lisbon on the 16th of March with her screw broken, and waits until another can be obtained from England. In addition to the full cargo of goods, she has on board 68,0001. of gold sent from London to tlae Bank of Rio.
Owing to doubts respecting the power of companies incorporated under the Limited Liability Act of 1856 to issue scrip, the Committee of the Stock-Exchange recently took the opinion of counsel on the point, and yesterday adopted the annexed resolution, which was posted in the house this morning:-
"The following resolution has been passed by the Committee and will in future form part of the law of the StockExchange:-
"I In settlements of shares of Companies, nder the Limited Liability Act, when the allottees have signed articles of association, the delivery of shares must be by deed of transfer; and, in cases where no such articles have been signed and scrip certificates only have been issued, she Committee will not fix a settling-day in such scrip, unless they bear a stam.p of one penny, and a limited period be stipulated on the scrip certificates for their registration.'

Agreed to.
QUESTION OF PRIV'ILEGE.
Sir W. MAGNAY.-The Court will perhaps permit me to interrupt the regular business with a short expla. nation and a few observations utpon my part with reference to some proceedings, in which I Cam personally and deeply interested, that took place at the last Court of Common Council. I have reason, I think, to comnplain that a matter connected with the character of any member of the Court should be brought forward in his absence, and without any intimation having previously been given to him that such a proceeding would take place. I felt that I had not been treated fairly in that respect, but I was content, under the full impression that the reference vith which the mover ended would have given me a full and fair opportunity of explainng all the circumstances connected with the matter that was then brought unider the notice of the Court. My object in rising to-day is, first, to ask,thelaw officers to whom the mnatter has been referred whether, aLccording to the terms of the reference, it is their intention to institute a full and searchin
inquiry into the whole of the facts andt circumstances of the. case. I pledge myself to submit myself to any examination that the Court miay think proper to institute into my conduct'; and I shallb most willing to abide by their report. (Hear, hear.) Theoocircumstances which resulted in this ref erence arose out of proceedings on the part of the Belgian Government in connexion with certain transactions which took place in the Great LuxembourglBa3llway Company. A trial took place in which the parties were fully acquitted, but before that trial took place a jutge d'inafruaion came to this country- he exammned the books of the company and the officers of tile company, and, among others, Mr. Ashwell, the managing director. Mfr. Ashwell, having occasion a few days afterwards to go to Brussels, desired his legal adviser there to ascertain whether there were any charges against him, or any circumstances to render his visit to that country inadvisable. The answer was that there -was nothing against him, andl that he was at perfectlibertyto go. 'Upon arriving at the first frontier town in Belgium he was seized by two gendarmes, conveyed to Brussels, and kept in a felons' prison f for five moniths, For many weeks he was not even told the nature of the charges against him. Bhs luggage was, taken from him, his pockets were emptied of their contents, he was not allowed to see his legal adviser alone. When permitted to sce his wife and family or legal adviser he was obliged to convers with them in the French language and in the presence of two witnesses. He was visited day by day by this juge d'iasfrucion, who, by threats, intimidation, and promises, endeavoured It, force him to criminate himself. He, however, was firm,
andl resisted all such ilegal, ungenerous, and tyrannical proceedings. To such an extent was this pesctio cared that a member of the Chamber of Deputies rose in his place and stated thteey ben ad been employed to make that miancintehslf Five months afterwards he was brogtttra. ewoeto this country for witnesses ; saehodrbee rprdt go to Bras. sels, but an intmto wareivdfm his counsel abroad that, iamc as they approved the po ceedings, they temsle would be seized and puIt i
prison. Notwithstanding all these disadvantages, Mr. Ashwell was acquitted of the charge upon which he was tried. The Government there have the power of maldnga a"SPpeal at any period within three years after the decision ofth
first tribunal, and they exercised this power 18 months after the trial took place. After the expernence of Mr. Ashwell's treatment, ad after the trial, which in this country would hav. been afinal, I did not think it prudent to proceed thither. I wvas recommended by my legal advisers not to trust myself to the tender mercies of the Belgian Governsnent. The trial, therefore, took place in the absence of witnesses whose testimony was most material to the issue to be tried, and who would have been arrested and also imprisonied had they gone there. These charges have beenl fully investigated in this country;- they have been the subject of much discussion among thle shareholders at different public meetings ; and the resualt has been that, upon the recommendation of the newdirectorsof thecompanyll discharges were given to thevarious persons,theoaccountswere regulaly pased, ad thewhole matterwas, as wesuposed, ended. The question that I wish now to put to the leare Recorder, as the head of the law officers of this corporation,
is whether the reference that has been made to himself and
his brother officers is of such a searching and extensive chiaracter as will enable thema to investigate the whole mierits of this case, or whether the merits are simply to be decided by the facts that appeared at the trial.
Mr. Alderman WflSow.-We are all ignorant of the proceedings; could you not give the Court some little account of them n
Sir W. MAGNAY.-At the suggestion of influential shareholders a sum of 60,0001., and afterwards 40,O000l ,was placed at our disposal for the purpose of enabling us to engage parties to obtain for us, in various ways, certain advantages which would extricate the company from all its difficulties, and enable us to go through with the affair. The directors undertook, through the medium of Mr. Ashwell, to do this, and they did expend 16,0001. in rewarding par-ties who assisted in obtaining these advantages for us. This maatter was fully explained to a commaittee of shareholders after the transaction had been concluded; it was fully explained to a committee of the principal shareholders,
wh passed a vote of thanks to the directors for the trouble they had taken and for the advantages which they had obtained for the company, and the paj>r were then sealed up, withi the distinct understanding that they were never again to be opened. The matter was also explained at a public meeting at which the accounts were passed. The expenditure was under the head of "1Compensation." Three years after this, when a new directiona entered upon the mnanagement of the affairs of the company, the accounts of the company were sifted from the coinmnencement to the end; that 16,OOO1. was separated from the head under -which it had been clased, and it was put unider the head of "1Secret service money." This gave offence to some parties, -who charged the directors
wihhaving falsified the accounts, inasmuch as they were put under the head of compensation without detailing the names of the parties to whom the money was 'riven. The other matter related to aloan of 58,0001. which
.s been voted by a beard meeting, attended, I believe, by every member of the board, for the purpose of obtaining ads
vantages that were to accrue to the company by introducin,, shaireholders and by getting persons in Plaris to interest theniselves incour affairs. 10,000 shares were purchased by parties abroad, and upon thosie 10,000 shares the compay advanced, by a formal resolution of the board, as much ias 68,0001. This became the subject of disussion, and it was uiltimately passed by the board. I now ask the learned Recorder whether the law officers are empowered by the terms of the reference to go into the whole casse, and whether witagreses are to be examined by them.
TIhe RECORDERt--Of course, in answering that question, I can only express my own individual opinion as one of the law officers, The law officers, as a body, have not yet had an opportunit of meeting upon the subject, and I do not think it is a mnatter upon 'which any doubt can be enter-

PUBLIC MEETINGS.
CITCY OF TONDON
A district meeting of the supporters of Baron Rothschild, Sir James Duke, Mr. Crawford, and 3Mr. Currie was held labt evening, at 21, CannOn-street; Mr. ,J. Ingram Travers in the chair. The four candidates attended to address the meeting, but neither of them deemed it necessary to enter into an exposition of his poltical sentiments, their principal object being to show to the constituency that they are acting in strict concert and combination.
The CaAiRurA explained that the committee of the four candidates had hitherto refrained from calling public meetings, and were especially anxious to avoid anything like an attack upon Lord J. Russell. There were 22,000 eectors in the city, but so much general apathy existed with regard to the election that it was probable only a small number of votes would be recorded on the polling-day. The canvass carried on on their part for the last two days was, however, very satifactory; and although a considerable portion of the older constituents, who had been disposed to look up to Lord J. Russell as a leader, had offered to vote for him more as a matter of feeling than of principle, still, up to Monday night, he appeared not to have obtained more than 600 promises. The noble lord's strength was greatly overrated.
Mr. J. DILLOx referred to a small meeting held on the previous day in the ward of Cripplegate-wlthout, remarkang that a resolution then camed in favour of Lord John Russell had been passed by only 15 persons.
Mr. STvxrs, the honorary secretary for that district (Bridge, Candlowick, and Walbrook wards), stated that the relative strength of the four candidates in those wards had been ascertained to be as three and two to one against Lord John Russell, the most popular candidate of all being Baron Rothschild.
Baron RoTuscnLmn then briefly addressed the meeting, pointing out that in his election a great principle was involved, which he hoped the citizens, after keeping it alive for 10 years, would not now allow to die out in his person. (Obeers.)
Sir J. DurE said that he had declined to accept of sup. port offered to him separately and distinct from his three fellow-candidates, in conjunetion with whom ha was resolved to go to the poll. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. CRAWFOID observed that Lord J. Russell had described him as the legitimate candidate who was steppin
into Mr. Masterman's place- but he (Mr. Crawford) denied that be represented either Ir. Masterman's principles or his influence. He did not believe that the noble lord would attain the high position on the poll which his sanguine friends anticipated for him. (Cheers.)
Mr. CURRiE said that the four candidates went upon what the Yankees called "the one ticket ;" that was, there was to be a firm and cordial co-operation between them. (Hear hear.) He was a devoted advocate of civil and religious iiberty, and should be deeply grieved indeed to see Baron Rothschild rejected; but there was no gronnd for any such apprehensien. If the four candidates had as raany active, zealous, and intelligent adherents in each of the other wards as they had in that one there could be no doubt of the triumphant return of them all Lord J. Russell, with that miserable pigmy wit for wlhlch he was distinguished, had designated him " the young man from Northampton." (A laugh.) The application of the word "young" to him was obviously iromcal, but he ventured to think the noble lord would find him young and vigorous enough to turn him out of the city. (Cheers and laughterl)
A resolution pledging the meeting to use strenuous exertions to eecure the election of the four candidates having been passed, the proceedings then terminated.
FINSBURY.
Last evening Mr. William Cox, one of the four aspirants to the honour of representing this constituency, made a profession of his political faith in the presence of a large number of the electors assembled at the British School7, Dennmark-street, Pentonville.
Mr. Parish was chairman, and, after a few remarks, introduced the candidate to the meeting.
Mr. Cox, in the course of his address, denied thal the House of Commons, as at present constituted, represented the people. The small boroughs were nothing but absurdities, and the remedy which he proposed was the abolition of all distinction between county and borough constituencies, and the estabHshment of electoral districts, in which every householder or occupier of even part of a house should be entitled to vote, as he contended that every man had a right to be represented in that House which imposed taxes upon him. (Hear, hear.) He was also in favour of short, butnot annual Parliaments. The ballot shoxld also have his support, notwithstanding the outcry that it was un-English, the fact being, as was proved by the practice at the great political cubs and elsewhere, that it was thoroughly Enghsh. Without the protection of the ballot no man could ive his vote according to his conecience. (Hear, hear.)He was opposed to the income-tax except as an extraordinary means of raising the siews of war in times of great emergency, and demanded cvil and relgious liberty for al classes. He was therefore in favour of the admission of Jews into the Leislature. If a Jew had a right to give, he ought necessarily to have a right also to receive a vote. (Hear, hear.) No man, in fact, oughtto be debarred by his religious convictions from a seat in the Legislature. It had been objected to him (Mr. Cox) that he was a lawyer, and that there were already too many lawyers in the House of Commons, which was the truth. But he was not a lawyer, for that term was restricted to barristers; he was a solicitor, and therefore, if the people of Finsbury should make him their representative, he could not, evea if be were so disposed, sell them for a county court judgeship, or any of those other sops which the Government gave to banisters who did their behests in the House of Commons. He wanted nothing from the Government, either for himself or for his friends. If he did he could easily get returned at the expense of 8001. or 1,5001. for some of the absurd little boroughs, without undergoing the toil and expense attendant upon the attempt to represent the voices of the vast and independent conststnency of Finsbury. He believed that the Government had acted rightly in defending their officers at Canton. (Cheers.) Those offlcers were on the spot, and better able than we at home to say what ought to be done. Besides, it should be remembered that Sir J. Bowring was the founder and secretary of the Peace Society, and we ought therefore to assume that the conduct of the Chinese authorities must have been intolerably provoldng when such a man resorted to the last extremity against them. But, thoug~h he (Mr. Cox) would support Lord Palmerston on the Chinese question, he shouald not be one of his thick and thin supporters, for he disagreed with nine-tenths of his political opinions.
In re ly to questions from electors,
Mr. (ox said he would support innocent Sunday recreatiors for the public as long as the Queen and the aristocracy were permitted to have their amusements on Sunday, but he would at the same time do nothing to assimilate the English to the continental Sabbath. He was a Churchman, and should be inclined to bowv with submission to the opimons of the bishops on the Sunday question. He was in favour of a 51. franchise. He would do all in his power to amend the gross injustices of the bankrupt laws, which shielded fraudulent debtors and wasted assets in costs, and would not vote for an extravagant annuity to the Princess Royal.
On the motion of Mr. WORTe, seconded by Mr. GREs.I. I.ND, a resolution pledging the meeting to support hr. Cox was passed amid loud cheers.
inAddress were alsodelivered last night to the constituents
nother parts of Einsbury bythe other candidates,-viz. Mr. T. S. Duncombe, Mr. Sereant Parry, and Major Reed.
THE TOWER HAMLETS.
A meeting of the electors was held at the Beaumont Institution, Mle-end-road, last evening. It was originally convened for the purpose of getting up a demonstration in favour of Mr. Ayrton, but, the interval before the nomination-day being so short, Mr. Ayrton determined to follow up his adr which was only pubbshed yesterday, by a speech to the constituency. Mr. Walker, member of the Board of Works, was called to the chair.
Mr. AYBTDOX said, he had at first declined to attend the rneeting, because he wished it to be clearly understood that he did not come forward on his own account, but only to afford the electors an opportunity of giving expression to their opinions. The ra idity of events, however, compelled him to act upon wnat he believed to be the feelngs of the Tower Hamlets, that the representation was not satisfactory, and to offer himself as a candidate. (Cheers.) He admitted that the fact stated in The Times this morning was correct-that there was no evidence of excitement in the borough; but he asserted that the inference that no real contest was intended was erroneous. Yesterday mornin they were mexrely preparing for war; they had not filre a shot, and therefore the echoes of the cannon could not be heard; but excitement was increasing hour by hour, and the movement in his favour, as the exponent of their views, would be carried forward, he hoped, to a sueceswaful issue. (Cheers.) He instanced the election of the last Parliament upon the cry of free trade, and the do-nothing policy which had been the evil consequence, as sufficient to warn them against allowing this election to turn upon the question of the Chinese vwar. That question, he said, was so insignificant that it ought not to occupyl4the people for an hour. They might leave the Executive Government to deal with it
They wonld send a misive to the Governor-Generat of India, ordering him to carry the war to a successful issue and in 8ix months the matter would be aettled. There was really lttle necessity for dissolving Parliaument upon a ote
as to the origin of the Chinese quarrel, but there was great necessity for doing it in order to give the people of England an opportun,ity of elect1nZ representatives who would act upon_some political principles, and nuot merely upon the
question or sapporting or opposing the Government of the day. (Cheers. The hon. gentleman proceeded to advocate
extended franchise, vote by ballot, and sho Parliaments. With regard to the abolition of church-rates, on behalf of the electors he repudiated the idea that they were tobe purchased byrelief from so small a burden. It was the most
tvinal instalent imaginble. They wanted the abolition of all religious establishments. (Hear.) Such esblish. ments belonged to ages long past, when all men thouaht alike in religion, wheR they were so ignorant they all be. lieved alike, and when those who dissented were burnt to death. (Hecar, he1ar.) He cautioned the electors not to be carried away by appeals to their patriotism, bat to remember that wars involved an increase in the national debt, vhwhi inftcted adidtional burdens on themselves and their children.
Mr. W. ALTr.An moved,-
" That tbhi meeting, havitng heard the views of Mr. Arton on the great eocial and political quesUons of the day, deem him eminently qualifed to represent the Tower Hamlets in Parliament, and hereby pledge teuemselres to support hitn at the ensaing election."
Ie stated that during the three last sesions there had been 666 divisions in the houses of Commons, from 499 of whicht Mr. Butler, and from 488 of which Sir W. Clay bad been absent. He charged Sir W. Clay with having neglected the opportunity of pressing the abolition of ohurch-rztes to a conclusion, and he expressed an opinion that once a year at least the members should meet their constituents and giTe an acoount of their stewardship.
Ir. POwLa sconded the motion.
Idr. FAitximakoed Mr. Ayrtosi to deanme what he meant by a liberal extensioni of the frnchW; what his opinions
were with rspect to the "brata1 unjust, and accursed Poor-laws," and whether he would vote for giving 70,ODX a.r to the Princes Royal ?
THORN-RmLu asked whether Mr. A4rton would endeavour to stem the tide of Sunday legislation, so that no man's faith should be subject to interference?
Mr. FLYxN2 asked whether the hon. candidate would support measures to protect the coalwbhippers and to give Improved dwellinga to the labourirg classes?
Mr. BASiScs asked whether Mr. Ayrton was in favour of opening places of amusement on 8andays, and how many points of the Charter he would support?
Mr. AYRTON regarded the question whetber he would aAt create a sort of fairy Princes with 70,0001. a-year as preposterous. (Cheers.) He thought one-tenth of the sum more than enough. LAn Elector.-" One-seventieth."] Whether a tenth or a seventieth was matter of detail, but he thought one-tenth a very decent maintenance for ayo n lady on the Continent. Foreigners believed that theEngs
had such an abundance of gold that it was their duty to relieve us of the surplus, but if any Prussian M1inister acted upon that impression he had enormously mistaken the intelligence of the people of this country. (Hear.) As to the franchise, he Was for giving it to every man who was a reputable member of society and a contributor to the wealth of the nation by his industry and intelligence. (Cheers.) As to the coalwhippers, he was against all State interference, but would support measures to develope euterprise and industry nd to protect labour. As to the Sday question he would not compel peple to do one thing or another
but he would support tbe laws which set the day apart for that pUrpOSe for which he thought it had been well appointed. (Cheers) As to the paper duty, the income-tax and other taxes, relief must depend on the maintenance of peace. War taxes would be repealed when the burdens of war ceased, and he should prefer duties on articles which would produce large sums at a small cost for collection. Mr. Ayrton excused himself from more detailed answers, on the ground that much longer time was required than could be devoted to so many subjects in one evening.
The motion was then put and carried unanimously.
Three cheers were given for Mr. Ayrton, and, with a vote of thanks to the chairman, the proceedings terminated.
SOUTHWARg.
Last night Mr. Pellatt, one of the former members and present candidates for the borough, met as many of the electors and others as the building could well accommodate at the Literary Institution, Borough-road, in order to recapitulate to them his political sentiments, and to solicit renewed confidence at their hand.
Mlr. G. NEWmN, in opening the proceedings, oongratu lated himself and the meeting that he had to introduce to them a well-tried man who had served them honestly and faithfully during five years, and who, if returned to Parliament again, would represent them with equal honesty and fidelity. He remarked upon Mr. Pellatt's constant attention to his Parliamentary duties, and upon the success which had attended his legislative efforts. He entered also upon various other topicswith which the public are tolerably familiar, and at length gave way to
MIr. PVuriv-r, Who was loudly cheered upon presenting himself. Happily, he said, he was not called upon to give a programie of his political career, because that must be wel knewn to all present. In the House of Commons there were, no doubt, many detanete members, many ornamental men, and many men of elocution ; but he had occupied a middle station-that of a man of business, representnt an industrial and manufacturing community, knowing {heir wants, and determined to redress their wrongs and to plac
before Parliament a fair and honest statement of the requirements of the district. (Cheers.) With reference to the late vote, it was greatly narrowing the question to say that it was a China queston, because, in faet, it involved an important constitution-' principle. Those of the IAberal party who voted against tne Government did so, no doubt, with great reluctance; but they resolved to vindicate truth rather than to follow expediency. He contendedthatin the Chinese affair Sir John Bwrn hated prematurely, and contrary to the orders of five successive Prime Ministers
who had directed him not to reopen the question of entrance into Canton without first referring home. Had Sir John Bowring followed those instructions and referred home before commencing operations, he would probably have had gunboats sent to hiis assistance, and his nands would have been so strengthened that the Cantonese would have been silenced without the effusion of anything like the blood that had been shed, while we should not have been in the ridiculous position of having taken several forts which we were compelled afterwards to abandon. (Cheers.) Something had been said about a coalition between himself and Sir C. Napier. He must explain that. He had nothing to say against the honest John Bull admiral, Sir C. Napier. -if he had been his son Sir Charles could not have patronized him more, and he certainly felt a sort of affection for him. What had given rise to the supposition of a coation, however, was this :-The same printer had been engaged by both committees to send round the ordinary canvassing cards to the voters, soliciting their vote andinter. est, and he was instructed by each committee separately to circulate those cards. In order to save expense the printer enclosed both cards in one envelope, and, lest he should omit to send both cards in every case, he tied the two together4 with a bit of twine - and this it was which had given rise to the idea. (Cheers and laughter.) Sir Charles Xapier had written to him upon the subject, and he (Mr. Pellatt) had sent him a reply, stating that neither he nor his committee had had any communication with Sir Charles or his committee, and that he did not intend in the slightest degree to coalesce. As Sir Charles appeared to feel rather strongly upon the subject, he had 'ven hiim permission to ublish that letter. (Cheers.)
. Pelatt then referred to labours in Parliament, comprising the introduction and passing of the Crossed Checks Act and the Dissenters' Marriages Act, the introduction of a BiU for enlarging the area of rating and to abolish the removal of the poor, the share which he had taken in the Charities Bil, in Mr. Mackinnon's committee for settling disputes between masters and workmen, and in other matters. (The recapitulation of these services and the explanation which Mfr. Pellatt gave of them were loudly cheered by his audience, and with a final reference to Mr. Cobden -whose name raised only a single cheer-the candidate concluded with an earnest and confident appeal to the constituency to return him again to Parliament.)
In answer to a question from Mr. BmIUET', a working man,
Mr. PELLATT stated that if any well-devised and practical meas-ure for promoting free emigration should come before Parliament he would give it his attention and support, either by consenting to serve upon a committee of inquiry, or by at once voting for it. Having ndertken to promote three bills already, he feared that he could not himself promise to introduce a measure on the subject.
On the motion of Mr. IaGGINS, seconded by Mr. HlAyrEs, a vote of confidence and approval in Mr. Pellatt was unanimously agreed to, and the proceedings terminated,
teetings were also held by Sir C. eapier, ast the Crown
Tavern, the Circus, London-road; and by M locke, at the Bridge-house Hotel, Welington-street; at each of which resolutions were passed in favour of the respective candidates.
a meeting of the friends and supporters of Mr. Williams took place at the Camberwell-halrove-lae, last evening.
hmr. . Ense OhON took the chair, alluded to the honest and idependent career of their late mcmber during the seven years he had represented them, and called upon the electors aga*in to return him by a large and triumlphant majority.
Mr. Wyo Lrcsi s, referring to his Parliamentar career, said, that during the 20 years he had sat inuthe ouse of Commons he had never asked for or received the slightest favour from the numerous Governments wvhich had held ofiice in that period, He had often been tried,
e had been subjected to temptations of all sorts and upon many occasions; and before these temptations almost every member of the House of Commons had succumbed. The first thing done when a ne member took his seat vias to find out his weak points, and in this the Government were generaly successtaL Some members were invited to aristocratic dinners halls, and things of that sort. This laid hold of a great number of them. Othersisoughthfor favours, if not for themselves, for their friends and supporters. He, however, had never accepted an invitation under any circumstances, When he first wrent into Parliament, the whipper-in, a gentleman *ho had the dispensation of 20.000 places, and who was alwrays scattering them over the House in order to get votes, came up to him and said, " What a misfortune it is you are always so cross with us (laughter); we don't care about the Tory party denouncing us, but it is most unpleasant to see you, a Liberal, and a supporter of Government in a great num-
ber of instances, finding fault with and exposing us in al sorts of ways. You don't want a place or rmoncy, but I should like very much to make friends with you. What would be agreeable to you? Would you like honours-a title ?" His answer was, "I see perfectly well what you want; you want me to support the Government. Now, rl tell you how you may secure my support. Bring forward nothing but measures beneficial to the country and you will always find me backing you up. No other temptation you can offer me will buy me or prevent me from discharging the duty which I owe to my constituents and to the country at large." (Cheers.) With regard to the necessity of enforcing greater economy in the national expenditure, be had hardly found one man in the House of Commons since the death of his revered friend Mr. EHume, who
supported him m denouncing the extravagance of the Government. Ho sOmetimes looked round him in vain for a seconder to propositions he made with regard to reductions of expenditure. After entering at some length upon the flaancial position of the country, and explainin the course
he had tasen with reference to various financial questions Mr. Williams proceeded to denounce the absence in the income-tax of any distinction between fixed and fluctuating incomes, and said that, if he were returned again to Parliament, he was not without hopes, from the feeling manifested by the Chancellor of the Exchequer when the subject was last before the House, that he should be able to procure the removal of the income-tax from incomes under l50I. (Hear, hear.) With regard to his vote upon the China question he was to'd that it had ofended many of his friends, ("1 No, no I") All ho could say was that he had bestowed mere consideration and felt more anxiety with regard to this vote than as to any he had ever given since he had had a seat in the House of Commons, and that he had not the alighest idea of placmg the Government of Lord Palmerston in any difficulty or of coalescing to bringin any other party in Parliament. He merely acted in accordance with what he considered the in. terests of his country, and if the vote was a mistake(though le denied this), it was a mere error of judgment, and involved no violation either of honesty or good faith. He trusted that the: -would not condemn him for the sake of this one act, anc overlook the many other subjects upon which they agreed with him in the course he had taken.
In reply to questions put to him, Mr. WILLAxs stated that he should op se any motion I Parliament the effect of whieh would the desecration of the Sabbath, and stated that he was in favour of the union of religious and secular education. or

MIDDLESEX
A large meeting of the electors of Middlesex took place at the Globe Tavern, Mfile-end-road, on Monday evening, to hear addresses from Lord Robert Grosvenor and Mr. Robert Hanbury, jun., the new candidate for the representation. Several of the most influential electors of the eastern portion of the county were on the platform.
Mr. G. HAmmACK took the chair, and having opened the proceedings,
Lord RoBxuT Gnos-I;op. caime ferward, and wa3 received with considerable cheering. Having thanked the electors ior the welcome they had given him, he said that when he came forward in 1842 his conduct was deemed so entirely unexceptional that no difference appeared to exist between him cud the electors, and few questions were asked him. He could not ay that that was the case now. His positionbeforetheminwsnowinvolvedin twoquestions. Upoa ene of them his motives had not only been misconstrued, but tmost grossly misrepresented. He would here express his gratification in meeting the electors, but he did not come to offer any apology. (Hear.) The two subjects which be referred to were what was known as the Chinese question, and that connected with Sunday trading. He would allude to the first-a question which had agitated the country considerably, and in vindicating himself on the course which he had pursued in that matter he was quito conscious that he was acting in opposition to many of his political friends; but, after giving the whole subject the deepest consideration, he found that he could not conscientiously come to any other conclusion than what he had expressed im giving his vote, He certainly did not think- that he should have to defend himself for independent voting. Perhapshe mightsay that the country had gone alittle wild on thig Chins question; but he thought the feeling had arisen in a great measure from a belief that it was an attempt to turn out a man who had rendered great service to the nation by the way he carried the country through the late war to an honourable peac He thought that was the reason for the generous feeling which h been exhibited, but he must express his sur,se that the whole House was not unanimous on 3M. den's motion. (Applause and dissent.) He was willing, however, to rest his case upon the addresses of several candidates who had voted with the Government. It was, however, said that it was a combination against the Government, and that they ought not to be allowed to exercise their judgment upon what was submitted to them, and that in truth they ought to say black is white and reverso the order of things. (Loud cries of "No, no," and some applause.) He would venture to add that when they came to fairly consider the whole matter they would como to the same conclusion as he had. (Shouts of " No, no !" and some signs of approbation.) Well, he was only offering a prediction upon a certain state of facts. If it was a question to
place the prest Govornment, which on general matters haa his warm support, for that of the opposite party, it would become one of serious moment with him; but he would add that no consideration would have induced him to live a vote contrary to what he had; and if he went intoethe House of Commons again as their representa. tive he must be allowed to exercise his beat judgment n matters which might be submitted to
e had no doubt that the Government acted under a kind of chivalrous feeling that they ought to defend their own servant, and so ye the oppouitition to the motion which they had. It did not amount to a direct censure on the policy of the Government, and the existence of the Government was not involved in any way by it. Upon the state of facts which had been presentedto him, he could not conscientiously come to anyother resut than he had. He had given his vote, and he was there to await the penalty. He would now refer to the Sunday trading question. (Loud cries of "Hear," and laughter.) He complained of the many hard names which had been used against him on that question. It was said that he was the enemy of the worlcin man. He could truly say that he never thought he should ave to defend himself from such a charge, and he could appol to a fact not far distant from where they were which would show that he really was not the enemy he had been represented to be to the working classes. That bill was promoted by him in order to secure an entire holyday for the working-classes on Sunday. (Hear, hear.) In 1854 parties waited upon him to introduce a Bil into the House. He quite agreed with their laudable object, but knowing the feeling which was felt in legislating on the sabject be declined. In 1855 the same parties came to him again ; they said they had can'assed the entire metropolis (laughter), and had petitions signed by 65,000 persons (they were SLnday-school teachers). He told them that he would not move until he had the support of the majority of the metropolitan members. The majority they obtained, and, being backed in that way, and thinking he was acting with the wishes of the people, he undertook to bring in the measure. his Lordship then detailed the progress of the Bill, and complained ef the way he had been attacked by the press. He spoke of the strong feeling which the Bill had produced, the scenes that took place in Hyde-ark, and that he undertook on his own responsibility to withdraw the measure. Bnt his belief was that the strong opposition which had been offered to the Bill was more caused by the measure which had been previously passel restricting the sale of beer on Sunday afternoons and after 10 o'clock at night, and that the introduction of another Bill relating to Sunday trading was Iookedupon asa further attempt to impose restrictions on the working classes. (Hear, and cries, " So itwas.")pTheBnl however was withdrawn, and though perhaps it was not proper to speak of the dead, he did not think it was likely that it would be resuscitated by him. (Loud cheers and laughter.) His Lordship then referred to his genetal political principles. He had been 35 years in Parlament, and he was as firm as ever he had been in promoting civil and religious liberty. Since he had been
elected, his opinion had undergone a change with respect to church-rates. He found by the census of 1852 that there were 5,000,000 worshippers of Christ who dissented from the church of England, and out of whose pockets was taken money for the maintenance of a fabric which they did not enter. (Hear, hear.) Now, he thought something should be done to relieve them, and he would vote for any measure which would free Dissenters from the payment of church-rates. (Loud cheers.) His wish was that the payment of the rate should be optional, but he wonld say that if in two or three years he found there was no other way of getting rid of it he would vote for the abolition of church. rates altogether. (Cheers.) He had voted with Mr. Locke Kng for the extension of the franchise; and he would here remark that,falthough lordiPalmerston might not be as good a Reformer as some could wish (hear), yet the moment his Lordship perceived the preponderatiDg feeling of the educated portion of the community and the stron feeling that was expressed, he readily gave way. (Hear.) The noble lord then dwelt upon hiseufforts to prevent er,7-apt practiees at elections and the reform he had succeeded in accomplishing. He then briefly adverted to the reason whichhad induced his late colleague (Mr. Osborne) to retire from the representation, and the leisure he would feel in co-operatig with Mfr. Hanbury, thie new candidate, should he be their choice, in promoting measures which might be conducive to the interest and prosperity of the country. (His Lordship sat down amid general cheering.)
A Voice.-w at is your opinion, Lord Robert, about the bands playing in the parks ? (Cheers and laughter.)
Lord RoBERT GRosx-,on said, he was informed that the military bands that played in the parks on Sunday complained of being compelled to work on that day. (" Hear hear," and cries of " No.") His duty in life was that a man on every seventh day should have a holyday, and to compel a man under military law to work on that day was nothing less than gross tyranny. (Loud cheers.)
Mr. HIL,SBURY then addressed the electors, and was greeted with great applause. He scarcely knew why one so young as he should have been invited to stand for that important metropolitan county except that the name wlich he bore had been associated with the Liberal cause in Middlesex for 100 years. (Cheers.) Having been solicited by a large circle of friends to come forward, and thinking his pohtical principles might not be unacceptable to the electors, he had ventured to become a candidate for their suffrages. (Applause.) If he were returned as their representative, he most certainly would support Lord Palmerston. (Great cheering and some dissent.] He was the man whom he thought was most likely to keep the country in peae, (hear, hear); and if Lord Palmerston hid
. at the head of the Government when the war broke out he would have shown a bold face, and have brought matters to a more early and successful issue. (Cheers.) It would be his earnest desire to pursue a true Liberal policy. He was a sincere member of the church of England, but he would have no difficulty in working with those who differed from her, (Hear.) He would be most glad to vote for any alteration in the present system of church-rates, for he had often observed the injustice of reqniring people to pay for the maintenance of a structure which they dad not enter. (Hear, hear.) If they returned biu to Parliament it would be on the condition that he must be allowed to be a freethinker, and he would not pledge himself to support blindly or indiscriminately any Administration. (Cheem)
An ELECrOR.-How about the ballot; would you vote for it?
Mr. HIsI uRy.-If that measure bebrought before Parliament I will vote for it. (Cheers) He did not think it would have the effect of removin intimidation, but he thought it would be worth a trial. Me did not think that an uniform system of education would work welL Ho would direct his attention to a retrenchment of the public expenditure. Afterhaving further alluded to other of his political opinons expressed n his address, Mr. Hanbury resumed his Eeat amid much cheering.
A Voice-What about the 70,000L which is to be votod to the Princess Royal on her marriage? answer that, Lord Robert.
Lord R. GROSVXNOR said he had heard nothing about it. All he could say was that if such a proposition was brought before the House of Commons ho must ascertain the reason for proposing it before he could give any answer. (Cheers and laughter.)
A Vowro.-Mr. Hanbury, wi you vote for tho extension of the franchise?
Mr. H,%icBuRy said he should vote for Mr. Locke King's motion. (Cheers.)
Dr. S2ow then moved,-
" That, In the opinion of this meeting, tho late member, Lord Robert Grosvenor, and 3Ir. IL Hanbury, Jun., are fit and proper peraons to epreent this connty in Parliament."
(A.pplUSO.)
The Rev. Mr RoWsmLi seconded the resolution, which
was unanimously adopted, amid general cheering.
The usual vote of thanks to the shair terminated the proceedings.
Lord R. Grosvenor and Mr. Hanbury attended meetings of the electors yesterday at Staines and Brentford.
GREENWICH.
There is now a third candidate for the re resenttion of this borough. Yesterday Mr. J. Townsen=, undertaker, Greenwich, issued an address offering himself to the electorsIn tias address Mr. Townsend says that his principal object is to rescue the borough fr'm the domination of an indi-
vidual, and adds that if elected he shall, should a more
zgttingpersonbefound,b owillingtoretire from therepresena tation of the borough. He sys that his political opimonx are too well known to need much explanation; but profeat,s lhimelf to be an advanced reformer.
zr. Aldermaa 8slomoas, who had been requested to allow iuml tA e nominated, has isued an addres, in wlhioh he
declines to contest the borou#h, because Mr. X Chambers and Lieutenant.General Codrington are both advocateg of those principles of cTil and religious liberty of which lhe is 1ircself a supporter.
On Monday evening tho friends of Mr. Chambers and General Codrington held a meeting at the Mitre Tavern in Greenwich, A large number of electors were presont,among wbom were 3Mr. ILt.

Mr. James Laing was in the chair. The proceedings of the meeting were characterized by great unanimity, and resolutions were areed to expressing oonfidence in General Codrington and M r. M. Chambers and constituting a committee to insure their return. Last evening the gallant General and Mr. Chambers addressed a meeting of electors held at the Five Bells, Hatcham, Their addresses 'were very favourably received, and a resolation was ado ted pledging the meeting to use every exertion to accure their return. On the same evening Mr. Townsend, whom numerous placards announce as the "resident" candidate, and who appears to stand upon the local interest, addressed a numerous meeting in the Lture-hall, Greenwich. All the candidates are sangaine of success. While the friends of Mr. IL Chambers ani General Codrington say that those gentlemen will be returned by a very large majority, the supporters of Mr. Townsond expross the greatest confidonce that they shall bring in their townsman at the head of the polL
HANTS (SOUTHERN DIVSION).
(BY XLXCTRIC TELEGRAPH.)
A public meeting of the electors of this division of the county of Rants, residing in Portsmouth, took place at St. George's-hall this evening, to hear Sir Jervoise Clarke Jervoise explain his views ; Mr. Alderman Georgo Sheppard in the chair.
Sir J. C. JERVoisE having addressed the meetin, it was moved by Mr. B. W. CAnTEK, econdedby Ir. W. J. CooPER, coroner, and carried unanimously-
"That this meeting, having beard the opinions of Sir Jervoie ClrkoeJerzovec, is of opinion that he is a fit and proper peron to re-
prent the Liberal electors of the southem division of this omnty Ia
Parlianent."
BEDFORD.
The Liberal party, determined to put an end tothe System of equal representation, " one 'Whig, one Tory," have brought out Mr. Thos. Barnard, in conjunction with Mr. Samuel Whitbread, the Liberal member in the late Parlianment. Captain Stuart, the Tory candidate, has been carrying on an active canvass.
Mr. E. T. Smith, the lessee of Drury-lane, has left Bridport and put up for Bedford, as a Radical. He has received promises of support from the Tories, and in realit
his principal support wil be from that party. Thousands of handbills, Ihigly laudatory of Mnr. Smith, continually arrive from London, and for several days past the greatest curiosity has been excited by large yellow posters stuck on the wals announcing that the "I cat will be let out of the bag by the Man of the People on Monday night at tho publiC meeting." The meeting referred to was held on Monday night at the Assombly rooms, which were thoroughly crowded.
Mr. SE;xXE, who was called to the chair, introduced " the M,an of the People," and announced, amid peals of laughter and loud appiause, that his name was " Smith."
The gentleman announced made his frst bow to at Bedfor[ audience, and was attended by a large partyof Tories, several of whom sat on the platform with him. After a lttle harmless banter in the meeting aboutthe "curious amalgamation,"
llr. E. T. SNnTH addressed the meeting. After promising to remedy the abuses of the Bedford Charity, Mr Smith announced himself in favour of the ballot and a liberal extension of the suffrage, as he maintained that every honest man had a right to the franchise. He was also for an extensive reform mn the army. In obedience to the call of the honest men who had waited upon him he had determined to come down and fight their cause at Bedford, and had left Bridport, where he was certain to be returned. (Cheers, and cries of "Gammon, Smith !") Eo could tell them that Mr. Seymour's retiring had given him a considerable addition of votes and influence. He had, however, come to Bedford; he had nailed his colours to the mast, should come to the poll, and remain until he had polled the last man. (Cheers, and mewing in imitation of cats, probably in referenee to the announcement that Mr. Smith would " let the cat out of the bag.")
Several persons who had accompanied Mr. Smith from London addressed the meeting s Radicals, " haters of 'Whig treachery -" one of them declaimed against the clergy, describing the bishops as a " lot of sacerdotal alligators." They extolled Mr. Smith in the highest terms as a pure Radical, a thorough philanthropist, a generous master over a thousand admiing dependents, and a thorough hardworker -one who always did two days' work in one.
An ELEcrOR objected to the latter qualification, on the ground that it would make work scarce in Bedford, and there was none too much to do now.
Great uproar succeeded, when some of the Bedford Radicals attempted to speak, and at length a resolution approving Mr. Smith as a fit and proper person to represent Bedford was moved by MIr. Dines, a adical, and seconded by Mr. Baxter, a Tory. On being put to the meeting a large number of hands were held up for and against, and the Chaarman announced that the resolution was carried.
YARMOUTH (GREAT).
On Monday evening this town was the scene of a great demonstration in favour of the Liberal and Ministerial candidates, Mr. Torrens MrCullagh and Mr. E. W. Watkin. A public meeting, convened by handbiM, was announced to be held in the Corn Exchange at S o'clock, and as that building became inconveniently crowded at the hour named it was intimated from the platform that the candidates would speak from the balcony in front of the Star Hotel, the Liberal head-quarters. In a few minutes a crowd of from 4,000 to 5,000 persons had assembled, and although the night was excessively cold the speeches delivered were received with interest and enthusiasm throughout the proceedings. Blue lights were occasionally burnt from the balcony, and the sudden glimpses thus afforded of tho eager and upturmed faces below were sinurlarly picturesque.
The chair was occupied by Mr. W. Sholly, one of the magistrates of the borough, and
The CAU ncsN, in addressing the meeting, took occasion to deny an industriously circulated rumour that tho Liberal party had offered to make a compromise with Sir Edmund Lacon, one of the Conservative candidates.
Mr. WATKDL, who was loudly applauded, referred to a remark made by Sir Edmund Lacon at a public meeting attended by that gentleman, to the effect that ho ws ready to support a moasure for promoting popular education, which he considered a very important object. Sir Edmund did not appear to have exatly made up his mind as to what system of education he would support, but he had expressed himself in favour of a mixture of secular and religious instruction. Ho (hIr. Watkin) considered tha* edncation was one of the great questions of the day, bocause the people would not be powerful unless they were edi_ catcd- but he should like to know what the party reue,ente, by Sir Edmund Lacon and his colleague, 5fr Vereker, had done for popular education. It was not 30 years since that party used to speak of the peoplo as the "swinish multitude," made to be governed, and not fit to govern themselves at all - and it was not very long sinco they used to say "a little learning was a dangerous thing," and give a great deal of hanging, which he supposed they thougnt a great deal better. (Laughter.) With regard to the elective franchise, he thought there was hardly a man present who would not be ready to say that it was not sufficiently extended, and that there was no safety for popalar liberties till the franchise was very widely enlarged. Having given the elective franchise to the working m^an, tho small shopkeeper, orthe tradesman, they ought to protect him in the exercise of his rights. A great deal of intimidation prevailed in Yarmouth, and such petty despotism was th cworst of alU despotisms, because, besides being crnel and wicked, it was contemptible and miserable. Was it not a niockery and delusion to give to the working man the power of voting if he was at the same time to be led by the nose by some powerful employer? If such a system was talked of in tho centre of Africa the natives would not believe it could exist in a free coauntry like England. If therewas one singreater than another, it was that committed by a man who, pose sessig a proud and honourable station, used his position and influence not to elevate, but to debase the great mass of the people. After all, the great source of pride and satisfaction in England was her mighty people; and, if this country was to progress and become sti greater, her peoplo must be made more prosperous and free under a Liberal Government emanating directly from the masses. It was by the adoption of such a policy only that England would continue to be what she had hitherto been-the envy of surounding nations and the admiration of the world I (Cheers.)
Mr. MrCULLAOG, in an effective aUd humourous sneech, principally confined to local topics, observed that when he and his colleague last appeared be fore a public meeting in the town they solicited support for a noble-hearted soldier -Major-General Windham-who was standing for the eastern division of the county. Since then, the eastern division of the great county of Norfolk had been emancipated from the mis-representation which had so long pro. vailed. Euat Norfolk had been won without a smtrnge. (Loud cheers.) Sir H. Stracey and Mr. Burroughe, feeling that they no longer possessed a hold upon the confidence of the electors of the division, had honestly and fairly resigned their pretensions, and Major-General Windham and Sir Edward Buxton would now walk over the course.
(Cneers.) For his own part, he was in favour of the accountability of members and a frequent return to the peeplI for fresh instryetionw a fresh powers The old }Parliament lived quite long enough, and ho did not thinklc i improved as it grew older. It was a very ineficent, a very blind a in many respects, a very dumb Parliament
(Laughter and cheers.) Could they not do better next time ? He offered himself for the situation, and promised to wrorkc hard for very lowv wages. (Laughter.) All he said was, "' rlese, your HIonour,, give me a fair trial;* I thinklcIam entitled to that, and if I don't do what I pr. mise turn me away-I won't oven bind you to a month's notice." (Laughter and cheers.)
MIr. OVLS, in a speech advocating the extension of the sufrage and the ballot, moved a resolution pleding the meeting to support Messrs. 'Cullsgh and W>atkin at the pol.
The resolution was caied on a showv of hands, and the roceodings closed with enthusiastic cheers for both candiThe Conservative candidates, Sir E. Lacon and the Hon. C. S. Veroker, have issued an address to the electors, in which thoy speak very confidently of their prospects. It is expected that the oontest will be one of the most severe ever kInown in the borough, as the supporters of Mr. Ruumbold, the former colleague of Sir EdmundLacon, have generally expressed their mtention to vote forMessrs. Watkin anu m'Clagh.
SHEFFIELD.
Every day furnishes fresh evidence of the severo nature of the suggle for the second eat for this borough. Tory canvamera are in every district ende.vouring to obtain xplit votes for Roebuck aind Overend, as againsat Mr. 31adfteld. To counteract this Mr. Bwoebuck has aoompanied his ool-
league to seeral ward meeting, and in hu addres deWlel the atatemenite,that Mr. Ovroed is meas bledrt kim iL
politics than Mr. Hadfield * on the great questions of.Par-
iamnentary reform, the ballot. civil and religious libert,
r. Hadfield had always voted with him, while Mr. Overend would be his opponent. At ameeting in the Park Ward on 3londa. night
Mr. konBucK said,-I dedire in the present election that there should be no mistake, and that " sham" shall not succeed. I desire to retain Mr. Overend as a friend, and though I hope to beat him, still, when he is beaten, I do not wish to affront him. I am told that my hon. colleague is a member of the Mianchester school-that he Is a man of peace. I havo always found that peace men are the most pug. nacious. (Laughter and cheers.) I was pleased to bear my colleague-though, mind, I am not a pugnacious man (waughter)-I was pleased to hear him, with a downrizht ohinBMllism, say "I should like to see any one attack my country; they would see if I would not be the nirst to eurn themi back." So, I Pay, I am not for aggressive war, I am for defensive war. I have been supposed not to be the friend of my country because I see in the distance other nations ranning closely on our heels and likely to enter into competition with us. I would detend England, and would maintain her against all nations. Therefore I would maintain her military and naval establlshments. I know that they are expensive, and that there is something in the military business not altogether conducive to making men good citizens, but in this imperfect world we must do the best we can. Wemnusthave an efficient army, and, above all, an efficient navy. We must maintain the defensive power of England-not her power for aggression or for conquest, but power to defend her against all aggressors. (Cheers.) With England is bound up the happiness of mankind- and, should her great power be abused, constitutionaligovernment every-where must suf'fer. By her wisdom and power constitutional government will be aided. If she be great and rich, and good, she wviU exercise an influence for the benefit of mankind (cheers); but if she be great and powrerful, and bad, her in9uence will be mischievous. Therefore, I say, wherever I have found her, asin the late Chinese struggle, on the side of injustice, cruelty, and wrong, there I have found fault with those who have misrepresented her, and I have opposed their aggressive conduct. I will not dwell on that now, for I beliove the
opular mind will soon co-ne round upon it. If we had longer time I do not believe that the possibility of a cry on that question would exist. (Cheers.) I now leave myself in your hands. I have pased my life in contests for the people. I hope sincerely that this contest may be my last, not because I wish my life to be ended, hut because I hope by this one trWial to make it clear to the people of Sheffield, and to those who oppose us, that honestly acting in your behalf in a straightfourard course will invariably receive your steady supnort. (Cheers.) With this I take my leave to-night. Next Saturday will be the polling-day. Do not let anyboy persuade you that you have no interest in what will then take place. If the deduction of an hour from your business is re uired I say, wiithout any regard to myself, that you wilf spend that hour wisely, even on selfish grounds, by devoting it to your public duty. The return from this town will not behidden under a bushel. Though I say it, the man selected by your suffrages is not unknown to his countrymen. If I be rejected, men wil point with the finger of scorn, and will say, " There is a man who has done his duty, and see how the people have rewarded him !" (Hear, hear.) This will be tiseir statement if I be rejected. This will also be their statement if I be accepted by you. (Loud cheers.)
Mr. HADIEsiLD, in the course of his address, said, if Lord Palmerston had done before the division on Mr. Cobden's motion what he did afterwards-probably in consequence of that division-if he had sent Lord Elgin to China to put right all the questions which had arisen, and to repair the nmischief that had been done, that division woulld never have taken place, and if it bad Lord Palmerston would have had a majority. (Cheers.) I have supported Lord Palmerston on many occasions when Mlr. Disraeli has tried his strength with him, and if the present proceedings should result-and I am not without apprehension thatthey will-in a frightful conflict with China, however much I nmay regret the circumstances, you may depend ur,on it I shallstand by my country. If Lord Palmerston hold the reins of Government, or whoever else may do so, I shaU support them in the war. (Cheers.)
SALFORD.
A meeting of the supporters of Mr. W. N. Massey, Ulnder-Secretary for the Hiome Department, was held in the Town-haU on Monday evening. About 800 persons were present, including Messrs Jeremiah Garnett, J. E. Taylor, v. R Callender, jun., E. Tootal, T. B. rotter, T. Fairbairn, C. E. Cawley, J. Pender, &e.
MIr. OLrIvR HEYWOOD presided, and, in opening the proceedings, alluded to the request which had been made to bim that he would offer himself as a candidate for this borough, and to which he had been unable to accede. Deeply as he had felt that compliment, he was almost more gratified to see the warm feeling on the part of so many of the electorsin supportof LordPalmerston'sAdministration. (Hisses, cheers, and groans, followed by "Three che-ers for Palmerston," ' Three for Cobden," and "Thxee for Armitage")
Mr. MASSEY was received with loud cheering. After an appeal to the generosity, candour, and hospitality always shown by Englishmen to a stranger, he said he appeared before the electors of this borough, in the exercise of his right as a public man to present himself to any portion of his fellow-countrymen, in order to submit his claims to their confidence and support. (Cheers.) He hadthe disadvantage of appearing in opposition to a gentleman who, he was assured, was entitled to the esteemand regard of all his acquaintance, but of whose political opinions he had no means of judging, except from the speech of Mr. Cobden, who introduced Sir E. Armitage to the notice of the electors. (11No,"=andintrrruption.) He (Mr. Massey) had the honour of Mr. Cobden's personal acquaintance, and as a most sincere and earnest adherent to the cause of free trade he should not presume to depreciate the great merits and reputation of that distinguished man, or forget his past services to the whole civilived world (cheers); but he felt bound to refer to the opinions of Mr. Cobden, because that gentleman was the political godfather of Sir E. Arinitage. He had recognized in Mr. Cobden a man of great genius and unsullied integrity, and had witnessed with admiration and delight the conclusive manner in which he con. futed the fallUaies of protection. But at length we found ourselves involved in a war with one of the mightiest mailitary nations of the earth. Mr. Cobden, however, had praised the Emperor of Rusida, and reviled the Emperor of the French, our true and faithful ally; and, with a strange ignorance of the relations between one independent State and another, had made it a topic of censure and invective against Lord Palmerston that he had recognized the French Emperor. Mr. Cobden wel knew that it was the practice of all countries in modern times not to criticize the will of neighbouring and independent nations. The Duke of Wellington recognized Louis Philippe, LordJ.Russellrecognized the Lepublic in 1848, and in the same way Lord Palmerston, to hiis praise, recognized the Goverinnent of Louis Napoleon, as was the duty of the Minister at the head of affairs. He (Mr. Massey) was there to defend Lord Palmerston's foreign policy (cheers and groans), because it had maintained the honour of England (cheers), encouraged as far as possible the liberties of Europe (groans), checked the progres,s of despotism (cheers), and, above all, protected and widened the avenues for our commerce. (Hear, hear.) The great preponderance of public opinion sanctioned the Russian war, yet everything which eloquence, authority, and energy could do to retard our progress and encourage that of the enemy was done by Mr. Cobden. (Loud cheers and groans,) Lord Palmerston was abandoned by his colleagues at the crisis when our army was reduced by mismanagement to 12,000 men, whose surrender or destruction was daily expected; but he stood firm, redeemed his country's honour, xained her up again upon her legs, made her show a bold and endurng front to the haughty and triumphant foe, and in 15 months reduced that foe to his own terms. (Cheers.) He had dealt a blow to Russia and to despotism which would be felt for many a day. As to tIhe China war, we found ourselves involved in it by the acts of our agents. Were we to repudiate them ? Lord Palmerston had the merit of never deserting a friend; and he (Mr. Massey) believed this war to be necessary, as did every statesman of character not deeply plunged in party or factious spirit. ("No, no !") Some discussion had taken place aniong our lawyers in Parliament as to whether the ship in question was English or not, but our envoy did not regard the honour of England in the spirit of a pettifogging lawyer, and he was justified in the course he pursued. It had been made a reproach against the present head of the Governument that he was not so eager in reforms at home as he was successful in policy abroad. But the way in which Englishmen succeeded was by always doing one thing at a tilDe. He (Mr. Massey) had regarded Lord J. Russell's Reform Bill, introduced underLord Aberdeen's Government, as a wise and statesman-like measure, subject to some nriticism in detail, and considering that we did not live in a time of such wonderful agitation an carried the great ReforoBill of 1830. However, until the people of thiscoun. try expressed a strong and unmistakable desire for further retorm of Parliament, he did not entertain very sanguine hopes of its accomplishment. ("Oh!") He believed Iord Palmerston's Government would endeavour to satisfy the moderate and reasonable wishes of the people of this country by proposing a measure of reform, or it would not much longer have the humble aid of such men as himself, or the aid of much greater men. ("Three cheers for Massey.") He (MIr. Massey) had voted and should vote for the ballot on every opportunity. He had always been a friend of civil and religious liberty. As a member of the Church of England he should do aU in his power to check the innovations lately introduced in that Church. From
conscientious conviction he voted against Sir J. Walmaley's Bill for opening places of amusement on Sundays. He had observed with pain the slow progress of the education question, and believed that nothing but mutual charity and wise concession would bring It to a happy conclusion. (" Maine Law.") He regarded such things as the Maine Law as aU nonsense, because to adopt compulsory measures in those matters wasi to begin at the wrong end. (Hear.) He had neither voted for nor against Mr. Locke King's motion (groans and laughter), because, while helagreed with its principle, it was a fragnentary measure, for the sake of -which he'-would not aid in breaking up the Governmentnot for 50 Locke Kings. (Cheers.)
Mr. E. TOOTAL moved a resolution, declaring Mr. Mayse a fit and proper person to represent the borough.
Mr. T. B. PoTTrE seconded the motion, and announced the adhosion of Mr. Mark Phillips, formerly member for Wancheater, to the cause of the new candidates for that citv against the domination of the Leacue. (Cheers.)
^He reb ilution was carried by a great majority, only 30 or 40 hands bgng shown gainst it.
HUDDERSIELD.
The returning-officer has appointed Friday next for the day of nomination, nd the ptllto be taken on Saturday. Both Mr. Akroyd and Mr. Cobden are rrying on an active canvass, and holding two or three meetingr each day in Huddersfield and the villages within the borough. Yesterday Mr. Cobden addressed between 3,000 and 4,000 persons assembled in front of the Queen's Hotel.
Air. COBDER said he did not come to tell them what he was going to do. He only asked them to judge of what he was by what he ba& done in times pmt. Speaking of his motion on the China question, he said, all who believed there had been a coalhtion to bring about the result which followed exceted him (MIr. Cobden) from being one of the conspirators, though he was the ringleader. Some said Cobden was a dupe, but he (Mr. Cobden) did not think
Cobden a gullible sort of person. He was too ahrewd a sort - of mon, and could see as far into a ministone as any one. The nanes of the den who voted on his side were a gusrantee againt any conspiracy. Had Governraent done before the resolution what it had done since-sent out Lord Elgin-there would have been no necessity for that notion or for a dissolution of Parliament. He had a very strong suspicion: that it had been a trick on the part of the Government in order to have a minority and get a dissolution. His reason for this supposition was that Lord Palmerston knew a dissolution must como soon, and, having no domestic policy upon which to appeal to the country-for Lord Palmerston had voted against every kind of reform, again8t Mr. Locke King's motion, would not vote for putring Scotland upon the same footing as England, and snapped his fingers at a repeal of the church-rates-how, then, could he dissolve mareamnt as the head of a Liberal partT-? His Lordship had. taken advantage of thls Chinese butiness, and called upon them to know whetber the British flag was to be protected. They all wanted to see it protected, but did not want to see it trailed in the dirt and blood and mud. (Cheers.) He (Mr. Cobden) was for upholding the policy of the Duke of Wellington, Sir R. Peel, and Lord A rdeeHe admilred the digit of attitude, of forbearance, and firHness with whichth ose statesmen conducted the affairs of this country in regard to foreigners-a policy totaUy distinct from the constant tendency to intermeddle with foreign countries which had characterized the Government of Lord Palmerston. His policy distracted attention from home affairs and domestic reforms. They wanted a new Reform Bill, with household suffrage and vote by ballot. Lately there were 200 men in the HIouse pledged to the ballot, andif those men did their duty the Minister would it he compelled to adopt.
A few quostions were asked Mr. Cobden, to which he replied, and a show of hands was then taken, from which it appeared to be the nearly unanimous opinion of the audience that Richard Cobden was a fit and proper person to represent Huddersfield.
WOLVERHAMPTON.
Messrs. ViWiers and Thornely addressed a pubEc meeting of their constituents in the Corn-Exchange on Monday evening. Mr. Henry Walker, chairman of the committee, presided. They were supported by all the influential momhers of the Liberal party m Wolverhampton, and the large hall was thronged with electors. Additional interest attached to the meeting from the circumstance that Mr. Kettle, who had been a candidate, reeigned that afternoon, and left the borough in the possession of the sitting members, who have retained it during 23 years.
Mr.VILUIEGS, in defending his support of Lord Palnerston, said his Lordship was not quite the man that a Liberal and Reformer would desire, but he was the best man that could be found, and was also an eminently able man for the duties which he undertook. (Applause.) Many complaints were made against him in the country, and some of them did not exist without reason, though the majority were not wel founded. After referring at some length to the administrative capacity displayed by the noble lord, Mr. Viliers went on to say he %sould ask whether, when Lord Palmerston cauie into power, he did not apply himself honestly to the difficulties of the position in which the country was placed, and the correction of evils which had resulted from previous mistakes? He would ask whether Lord Palmerston did not restore the honour of the country; whether he did not redeem the credit of its administration; whether he did not renew the condition of our army; whether he did not carry on the war with vigour; whether he did not conduct it with success, and whether he did not bring it to an honourable termination ? (Applause.) Notwithstanding allthese services, when Parliament met every effort was made to embarrass and annoy him, until at length came the motion upon China. Mr. Villiers defended the proceedings of Lord Palmerston in this matter, contending that it would be to the advantage of both England and the Chinese that Great Britain should be represented at Canton and Pekin. He was sure that Lord Palmerston desired to effect reforms in every department of the State where they were needed, and he knew that he was now taking measures with a view to a healthy reform in both army and navy. So soon, also, as Lord Palmerston was convinced that the time was come that it would be for the benefit of the country to extend the 101. franchise to counties he would carry that measure. He had the fullest faith in the good intentions of his Lordship in regard to the welfare of the country, and was sure that there was nothing he would not do if he was satisfied that it would lead to such an issue. (Applause.(
r. T1oRNLx9 Wspoke briefly, and then
Theresolution which was given in The Timnms yesterday, through the Telegraph, approving the sitting members, and pledging the meeting to aim at their triumphant return, was passed by acclamation.
EDINBURG1H.
A meeting of the original Liberal Committee of the Edinburgh electors was held on Monday, the Lord Provost presiding. About 200 gentlemen were present.
His LoRDsHr expressed his belief that this committee and the Liberal electors of Edinburgh were resolved, by every means in their power, to evince their unshaken confidence in Lord Palmerston and his Government. (Cheers.) Their obligations to him for his vigorous conduct of the war, and his firm attitude in the negotiations which preceded and brought about the peace, were too strong to allow of their deserting him at this crisis; and he had no doubt that the same ability which brought the late war to a successful termination wouid carry the country safely and honourably through the contest with China. (Cheers.) Both the members for the city now presented themselves for re-election, and it was a subject of congatulation to them that for the result of the late adverse vote in the House of Commons neither of these gentlemen were responsible.
Mr. HARRIsoN, seconded by Mr. SHmAID, advocate, moved,
That it appears to this committee that no candidate ought toreceive the suffrages of the IAberia electors of Edinburgh vho has not given, aud who is not wiling to give, a steady and ,lncore, though independent, support to the Government oc Lord Palmeraton, as the only Iberal Government that sems practioable under exising circumstances, and as having deserved wleU of the country by the spirit nud ability with which its head hbs met the difficulties ot the period auring which he haa held power.-
The resolution was put, and generally responded to, but, before it passed,
Mr. LosnatER, advocate, saidthat, if it wasat all meantto exclude a man like Lord John Russell, supposing any one to propose him, he, for one, could not approve it. He regarded that noble lord as our greatest champion of Liberal priciples, and, if brought forward, be for one meant to
Mr.ShadfL)OGANrsaid, if the gentleman who had spoken could make out that Lord John Russell had hitherto given, and was now prepared to give, a steady and sincere, though independent support to Lord Palmerston's Government, then this resolution did not strike at his being a candidate for the representation of thcidty; but if that question were answered in the negative, as he thought it must be answered then it certainly did exclude that noble lord. He knew no one who had deserved more highly of his country, and of the Liberal party in particular, than Lord John Russell, hut it did seem to him that that noble lord was now comingforward inthe city of London as one avowedly not prepared to support the present Administration, and that bein the case, and still more, looking at the quarter from which alone any suggestion as to his candidature had come (referring to Mr. Duncan M'Laren) he had no hesitation in saying that, with a warm and deep-rooted veneration for Lord John Russell's personal and political character, he would vote against him next Saturday, and in favour of the most humble citizen who, coming forward as a supporter of the Government, chose to solicit their suffrages.
Mr. Sheriff TioiisoN expressed his opinion that Lord John Russell was one ef the most stedfast friends of constitutional liberty, but this was a great crisis in national affairs, and he thought that the unfortunate courseLord John Russell had followed did not warrant them in supportinD him at the present time.
Mtr. W. SISr1T, accountant, said, he quite concurred with what had been said as to the ability displayed by Lord Palmerston in his foreign policy ; yet when he turned his attention to domestic questions, which must at no distant period occupy the Legislature, he was bound to say that he
new nothing in the principles or in the history of Lord Palmerston which woild induce him to cast up his hat for him in this manner, and make the exclusive support of his Government a testing question in the election.
MIr. J. R. STODAIST, W.S., said, that he and other friends did not put the same construction on the resolution which Mr. Logan had done. Lord John RusseU had in London stated that he would give his support to the present Government-not indeed a slavish support (their present members did not give that)-but a general support, so that even his case was covered by the resolution now proposed. The question, however, was not a practical one, as both elections had been fixed for the same day, so that Lord John Russell could not be brought forward for Edinburgh in the event of his losing his seatifor London.
With these differing interpoUations the resolution was again put and carried.
A second resolution -was passed, expressing confidence in Mr. Black, who is the only one of the late members nominated by this committee.
THE KILMARNOCK BURGEIS.
On Monday Mr. Bonveric, the candidate for the Kilmarnock district of burghs, addressed the electors in the hall of the George Inn. Provost Drakie presided.
Air. BOUVERi}, after some preliminary observations, said that it was not a question as to the principle either of our commercial or of our domestic legisla. tion. It was no question upon which our lavs, financial or otherwise, sbould be framed. BSt it was a question as to the mode in which you think that Her Majesty's Executive Government had discharged the duties which they had undertaken as the Administration of this country. The House of Commons had passed a vote expressin their disapprobation or censure of Her Majesty's Government. Certain events had taken place in a distant region of the globe-in Chinaand Her Majesty's representatives in that country had taken a certain coure which they thought it was their duty to do in discharge of the responsibility committed to them. That course, unfortunately, had not received the approbation of the House of Commuons. He would not at. tempt to go through the whole question, but simply proposed to state a few facts upon the subject. The war with China 14 or 15 years ago resulted in peace with that country, and the consequence of that peace had been a vast incresse in trade. The greater part of that trade was carried on by a certainclassof vessels. Oneof those vessels, lyingin Canton river within the jurisdiction of the Chinese authorities, whose papers had been dulydeposited accordingto theregula. tions of the Briti,h Consul, with the British flag flying at the peak and the British blue-peter at her masthead, wa boarded. Now, this proceeding was a breach of the engagement with the Chinese authorities in accordance with the treaty, and was contrary to the acknowledged practise of civilized nations in these matters. By that treaty the Chinese were bound, if they had a cause of complaint against any person on board a vessel, to hsave brought that complaint under the notice of our diplomatic representatives in that country, and to have claimed reparation. They did not. The cap)tain remonstrated Iwith the Chinese officials, but they dill persiste in what they had begun. The Consul then remonstrated, but his
lremonstrance was in-vain. The coure which he took Wau
the reasonAble ud ight one. Heconimunicate with the .-Chineso authorities, stated Wbat-ha taken place, requied
that w hat hd been done shoul4 be undone, that th fqlags and men should be reatored to the vessel, and an apology made for the outrage which had been comnitted T a Chinese authoiities refused. The Cansul then thought it necessary to consult the Plenipotentiary, Sir John Bowring, and the Admiral, and they considered that the pro, ceeding was of such a character that it was neoessary to take immediats and forcible steps towards procuring redress for the outrage. Accordingly, notice was given to the Chinese authorities that if they did not make the z3paation demanded proceedings would be taken of a forcible character. No satisfaction was given, and a naval force proceeded to seize the Chinese forts which lay in the Canton river, and to carry out other offensive operations. Upon these facts the House of Commons decided that the Admiral (Sir Michael Seymour) and Sir John Bowing were not justified In the course they took iu insisting upon reparation, and, secondly, that Her Majesty's Government were deserving of censure for the approbation they gave to their representatives. The Government, therefore, had either to resign the reins of government or to make an appeal to the country. Sir John Bowring, Sir Michael Seymour, and Consul Parkes all agreed as to the propriety of the course which had been pursued, because they thought it necessary for the safety of the property and interests committed to their care. Now, was Sir John Bowrng a likely man to get into an unnecessary quarrel with the Chinese authorities? On the contrary,%he was ane minently peaceable and placable man, and not one who was perpetually inhotwater. He wasknown asamember of the reace Society, and that fact appears to be the chief thing against him, for it was said that wheu they become pugnacious there are no parties who are more so than the members of that society. (Cheers.) Sir Michael Seymour, also, Was a nu of calm, clear, and judicious deportment, and, in fact, during the debate in the House of Commons he was so greatly respected that an invidious attempt was made to fasten the whole blame upon Sir John Bowining. There was an important question to consider in regard to this Chma matter. If the whole course of these proceedings were unjustifiable, we were wrong from the beginning, and we have, on the other hand, been guilty of committing an outrage upon the Chinese, and therefore we are bound to make reparation to them. It was therefore for the constituencies of the country to declare whether the course adopted was right. They had heard a great deal about combinations, coalitions, concourses of atoms, and so forth. Now, there was no harm in a coalition if it were a common action of men who had been previously kept apart from some accidental circumstance, and who might by some community of action agree to act in concord and harmony. But what ought to be reprobated was when a number of men of different political opinions having no common bond of action, and not likely to have any, unite together for the purpose of placing the Government In a minority, and dnving it out of its position. After eulogizing the public career of Lord Palmerston, Mr. Bouverie then proceeded to speak upon peace, retrenchment or economy, and reform, which, he said, were the essential points of the Liberal policy. He said that he was in favour of the Reform Bill of Lord Aberdeen, introduced in 1854, but which, in consequence of the amount of interest engendered by the war, was passed over without receiving special attention from the public, and which lowered the suffrage in counties to 101. instead of 501. and in burghs to 61. instead of 101 He had opposed Locke King's motion because he thought there were some objectionable features in it which would not be satisfactory to the country generally. He concluded as follows :-Let me assure you it has been my ardent desire to prove to you thatI was not unde. serving of the confidence you placed in me, and which I am prend to know you have on varous occasions renew ed, and
ask now for your candid judgment whether I have executed my trust for your benefit and for the benefit of the country.
Election Intelligence.
ELECTION INTELLIGENCB.
CITY OF LONDnN%
Lord J. Russell's committee are prosecuting a vigorous and, it is said, satisfactory canvass. The noble lord has a separate committee-room, and the gentlemen who canvass for him refuse to give any opinion as to the relative claiins of the other candidates. A few members of the Whig party intend to "plump" for Lord J. Russell, but his principal hope of success is based upon the probability that the electors who have any cause for dissatisfaction with any one of the four opposition candidates will eliminate the least popular name from their "ticket" and substitute that of the noble lord. The partisans of peace. at-any-price are at a remarkable discount in the city. No one defends Lord John's conduct as the British Plenipoten. tiy at Vienna, and if the noble lord is returned it will only be because the city Liberals aro disposed to forgive a great deal to oneo whose past services outweigh in their eyes his recent deficiencies. Among the election squibs is a placard, "tSmith, Brown, Jones, and Robinson," for the city of London-an allusion to the undistingnished names of the four candidates,-Rothschild, Duke, Crawford, and Currie,-which professes to be issued by the "Liberal Restriction Society." 'Upon the other side is a placard signed "John Bull," which arraigns Lord John for his opposition to the ballot and to the abolition of church-rates. Another, signed "Old NolL, argues that the city of London, with its vast local affairs, is not the proper seat for a statesman and great party leader. The witer says:-
"When, sixteen yearg ago,Lord John Russell became a candidate to incarnate an economicl3 principle, he made it an express condition that he should not be askd to,attend to your local aff&irs,-% condition whlcb it mustbe owned,he hasobserved with mostrigidfidelsty. To that stipulation you sbould never have consented; from a departure Eo monstrous from the very purpo3e of representation You cannot too soon be freed. It is a seandal to your independenoe, and a reproach to your capacity, that yon are so destitute of self-respect as to compound even for a lord on terms so outrageousu"
Baron Rothschild has issued the following circular, in which he announces his intention to resign hMs seat at the end of next session, if the House of Lords again refuses to admit the Jews to a seat in the Lower House:-
I Sir,-I have the honour of enclosing my address, and hope to be favoured with your vote and support.
I have already reoeived promies of aitatne from aul quarters, and can confilently say that I folly expect to have the honour of again belng your representative. Should I be so fertunate I shaU endeavour to have our question Introduced Into Parliament as soon as possible.
" The already generally expreseed opinion that the next wiU be a very lihberal Pasrliament is confirmed by the acomnta publshed in the daily papers. It our cause, then, with increawed maloritles in the House of Commons, ho not successful, I shaU not hestitte In imnmediatny placing my neat at your disposal
"I have the honour to remain, Sir,
" Your most obli ged and obedient servant,
"Xew-court, Matarch, 2, 1S51' " LINaEL DE ROTHSCHILD.
BER ICK.-i.--r. Henry Smith Evans has offered himself as a candidate for this county. His address states him to be in favour of the abolition of all taxes which bear exclusively on industry, of a reduction of the national expenditure, with an abolition of useless sinecures and pensions, with due care at the same time for the efficiency and security of the public service. He will support a judicious system of religions education, and direct his attention to the consolidation and sinpifying of the statute law, and will be in favour of any plan for promoting and facilitating emigration to the colonies as well as establishling home colonization, whereby thousands of acres of waste land in Great Britain could be brought into profitable occupation. In conclusion he says:-
" In declaring mysef the friend of peace, ani of sccal and Intellectual advanecement, my exruest desire is to maintain the funds mental principles of the British Constitution, to reform without impairing, as the only means of preserving, our civil and ecclesiastical institutlons, and, while I am the advocate of freedom to all religious opinions, I am an enemy to the domination of any."
BUCKINGHtst-The Marquis of Chandos has announced his intention not to offer himself as a candidate for this borough. The Hon. R. Cavendish, of Thornton-haUl, has issued an address on the Liberal interest, and intimates that he wliU give Lord Palmerston's Government his general support. Mr, Philip Box, a gentleman locaUy connected, has offered himself as a candidate as a Liberal-Conservative, There is every prospect of a severe contest.
BuRY ST. EDALm\D's.-Lord Jermyn and Mr. Porteus Oakes, the late members, offer themselves for re-election in the Conservative interest, Mr. J. A. Hardcastle, of Writtle, is the only gentleman at present named to come forward in the Liberal interest.
CA.NTERBURY.-OA Monday evening the Right Hon. Sir W. Somerville met a large body of hi. constituents at the Guildhall, which was crammed on the occasion. Mr. Alderman Plummer occupied the chair. Sir W. SomerviUle addressed the electors at considerable length in explanation of his political opinions, and also of the views which he held in opposition to the Government on the China question; and at the conclusion the meeting pledged itself to use every exertion to secure his return. Mr. C. M. Lushington has retired from the contest.
CHICHESTER.-Mr. C. Stafford King has entered the lsts as a candidate. In his address he says he shall inscsibe on his banner, " Lord Palmerston and the honour of England abroad, and social and progressive improvemnts and reforms at homs." He believes that the honour of England is safe under the pilotage of the Premier, whose antecedents assure us that he is the man who can and wil teach the Chinese that they shal not be alowed, in defiance of all divine and human right, to shut themselves up against the rest of the world, or laugh at treaties, or avenge themselves of supposed wrongs by poisonings and decapitations.
COLCIISTER.-As was intimated on Monday. Captain Paget, R.A.. the Conservative candidate, had retired; but disaffection is expressed by a section of the burgesses, who are determined that no compromise shall be effected, and are concerting plans for an opposition. A meeting is about to be held for the purpose of inviting two other candidates to contest the borough. These are Mr. Cole, nephewr of Lord Derby and father-in-law of the Marquis of Drogheda, in the Conservative interest, and MIr. W. B. Havens a nonprctising barrister, resident at Danyland, near Colchester.
Cole professes himself a moderate Tory, favourable to existing institutions in church and State, but decidedly opposed to the abolition of the Maynooth endowment. Mr. Havens is an ultra-Radical, but in favour of the rant to Maynooth CoUega. This opposition, however, finds but little patronage in the borough, and the return of Mr, Miller and Mr. Rebow is almost certain.
DERBY.-The nomination is fixed for Friday, and the election for Saturday next. The rival candidates, Mr. James, Chancery barrister, and Mr. Beale, deputy-chairman of the Midland Railway, yesterday addressed the electors ggain. Both gentlemen entertain similar political views. Mr. James, in the course of a long address, said be ws in favour of a substantial extension of the franchise, and the vote by ballot-all measures tending to this should have his earnest support. He did not go so far u the separtion of Church and State, but he was prepared to do much in favonr of religious liberty by supportipg the Jewish Disabilities Bil, and removing many remnants of the intolerant of past times. With regard to fiaancial reform he was not a great believer in any
f iteacheimeg propondecd to the people, maraly shifting the burden of taxation from one thing to another. Certinaly he would prefer direct to indErect tuation, bat merey hifting the burden from articles of consumption and placing it onproperty and income would not be lightening that burden, it would only be removing it from the back and putting it on the shoulder. Another grave Ifestion wasthe education of the people. He shonldnhimsel
desiroa to aid in so good and so boly a tak, but at the same time he would be no partto theintroduction ofacentralizing system of despotism on the part of the Government. (Apt lause.) After many arments in favourof law reform, eloctoral reform, and votie by ballot, the learned gentleman said, he hold, therefore, the vote by ballot to be essential to eve
P vwell-devised scheme for the extension of the franchise, and they could not have free and independent election without it. Mr. Beale also addressed the meeting briefly, avow-ing himself an independent Liberal candidate, and denying that the influence of the MidlandRailway was used on his behalf, or even that anr of the directors were acquainted with his having offered himnself a a candidate. The following resoltinon wahs passed unanimously-~
"That the ccrdial thanks of this meeting be given to Mr. Beale for he very clear ani candid manner tn wvhich be ha explained his political views ana opinions on this occasion, and pledges itielf to support him."
DOxD.-The Conservative electors have held a meeting and have unanimously resolved to gapoort Mr. Sheridan against Lord Ward's interest. Mr. Sberidan is therefore baakedbyConseitativen,;Liberals, &nd Radicals,-indeed, by all shades of politicians. Mere politics are forgotten in this contest, which is considered one for the independence of the borough. The canvass for Mr. Sheridan is said to have been successful. A Mr. Seymour, a connexion of the Somerset family, will, itis said, offer hime'if in the event of Mr. Shenidan's retiring.
DuIUAm (SouTH)-.-r. H. Pease has acceded to a requiition presented by the Liberal electors, and will contest ths division. In his address, issued yeeterday, he professes himself a supporter of Lord Palmerston. He asys-
" X ry effort mast be u ed to encourage the agricultural, m?nufac. turing, mining, and maritime energies of the people. The growing intelgence and the virtue ot the mause, must be rtimulAtei Equal lawa, strict economy of our national rerourcee, and those reforms in oar various institutions, including an extension of the franchise, which a wi and judicious policy approves, must bo unhesitatingly pursued."
ESSEX (SouTii).-The nomination for South Essex is fixed for Monday, at Cheelmsford, and the prevailing opinion is that if Mr. Baker Wingfield bo put in nomination he will not proceed to a poll, the late members, Sir W. B. Smyth and Mr. T. W. Bramston having given general satisfaction to their constituents, and well canvassed the voters throughout the county before the appearance of the Liberal candidate,
EXxTRi.-The writ for the election of members to serve in the ensuing Parliament was proclaimed hero on Monday. At a large meeting of the supporters of Sir John Duncworth, held on Saturday, the hon. baronet on being presented with a requisition signed by nearly 600 electors, asking him to come forward again on the Conservative interest, stated positively his intention not to stand, inasmuch asit would involve a serious breach of the Conservative party. The only two candidates at present in the fieldwho will in aU probability be elected-are Mfr. Divett, Liberal, and Mr. Gard, whose political principles are understood to be Conservative, but the hon. gentleman in his address has not professed to belong to any party, although he approves Lord Palmerston's policy on the China question.
HARWICw.-In this borough there will also be s strong contest, and although but one candidate in the Conservative interest has yet appeared, the nomination of a second is psitively announced to contest the representation with
jor Warburton, R.A., and M3r. J. Bagehaw. Mr. Benjamin Greene has intimated his intention of offerig himself s a candidate. He states in his address that he is a member of the church of England, and opposed to all further concessions to Popery. He is in favour of economy in our public establisbments, but he will not consent to measures which will diminish their real efficiency, or endanger the credit of the countr:. He says:-
" Whatever may have been the orizin of the existing state of things In China, there can be no doubt that the honour of the EnglLsh flag must be firmly upbeld. The dignity of this great country must not be lowered, nor the lives and rroperty of our absent countrymen jeopardized; and however anxious I may be to secure the blefings Ot Peace. It Is in my opinion imposslble now to recede."
IPswicH (BOROIrCH).-The canvass of MIr. Adair and Mr. Marshinan, the Liberal candidates for this borough, dfd tot go on very satisfactorily, in consequence of a large number of the Liberals being dissatisfied with the addresses of the hon. gentlemnen, as well as the exposition of their sentiments at a meeting held on Saturday last. In consequence thereof, a large section of the Liberal party met at " Pearce's Room" on Monday night, to consider what steps should be ado pted. It was stated that the views of those two candidates could not be reled on, and that they were believed not to be firm in their av owed principles. Their addresses to the electors, it was unanimously agreed by all present, were "couched in such laugnage that they had so many holes to slip out if they thought fit." After some hours' discussion upon the ballot, extension of the suffrage, the Maynooth grant, the question relating to the support of religion in the colonies from the civil funds, church-rates and university qualifications, and other minor points, it was agreed that a deputation from the meeting should wait upon Mr. Adair and Mr. Marshman, requesting that thsoe two candidates should immediately proceed to the place of meeting. Mr. Adair and Mr. Marshman consented, and accompanied the deputation to Pearce's Room, where they were questioned pby theo chairman. Although the two hon. candidates did not go 9inite far enough for the meeting on one or two questions, t Was resolved, after catechizing Mr. Marshman and Mr. Adair for more than hour, to " use their utmost efforts to insure the return of those gentlemen." The Liberal cause is certainly now on a much better footing, for it, like the Conservative interest, is firm and united. Both parties seem sanguine as to their success, but whichever gain the victory (if it be not one and one as before) the majority will not be large.
ISLE OF WIGHIT (Cou.-TY).-Mr. Thomas Wiles Fleming has issued an address in the Conservative interest, and intends to contest this county against Mr. C. C. Clifford, Lord Palmerston's private secretary, and MIr. Wynne Wil. Hams (both Liberals).
LFOmuSsTE_.-Mr. Phillimore has withdrawn from the contest for the borough, and has issued a long address to the electors, in which he says-" The Liberal party is divided. I cannot hope on this occasion for that cordial support which could alone enable me now, as it enabled me before, to triuinph over those vast resources and the dictation of that local influence which are arrayed against me." " The time will come," he says, "when my vote on the Canton question will be understood. Few of those by whom it is condemned have read the papers laid before Parliament, which I presume were so laid for the purpose of enabling us to form an opinion."
L}imI REGis.-Three candidates are in the field-Mr. W. Elers, Mr. W. Pinney, and Mr. R. G. Chidley. Mr. Elers declares himself an advocate of free trade, and, while opposed to all violent or sudden changes, was an advocate for safe progression. He says:-
f Sinecures, whether in Church or State, should he abolished. I would have place, employment, and honour open like to every class; but capaity and merit should be the teat and the only means of obtaining either. I would havo 'the right man in tbe right place.'I
Mr. Pinney declares himself in favour of tbe Government on the Chinese question. He would, if returned, advocate as he always has done, moderate but progressive reforms in all the institutions of the country, the cause of ivil and religious liberty, and the remission of taxation on those articles of consumption which more particularly affect the working classes of the community. The third candidate, Mr. B. G. Chidley, declares himself a Liberal-Conserva. tive.
NE'WCASTLE.-The three candidates, Messrs. Headlam, Ridley, and Carstairs, are diligently pursuing their canvass this morning. Their respective partisans speak confidently of their sucewss. It can hardly be said that any principle is involved in the contest. Allthe candidates avow themselves Liberals, and general supporters of Lord Palmerston. It was expected that the Tories -would avail themselves of the prevailing disunion to slip in their n,an, but Mr. Hodgson Hiinde, their favourite, declines to come forward. Mr. Headlam met his friends at the Royal Assembly Rooms, Grainger-street, last night, and was warmly received. His speech consisted mainly of remarks on local topics; after which he gave an indignant denial to the insinuated charoe that he was a mere place-hunter.
NORTHAM3PTON.-The Right Hon. R. V. Smith addressed the electors from the balcony of the Peacock Inn on Monday evening. As a member of the Government Mr. Smith's sentiments are well known. He said be should be happy to have MIr. Gilpin as a coleague, although his opinions on several questions did not accord with those entertained by that gentleman-to wit, the ballot, the suffs-age, and the Chinese war. MIr. G. HI. Hunnt, the Conservative candidate, has not yet made his appearance. He was in Egypt when the defeat of Mlinisters took place; but his friends here are making every exertion, and seem confident of their success.
NolTAmPaT. oSurs x (SouTH).-Lord Althorpe is straining every nerve to secure his return for the southdra-4ivision of the county, and unless his Conservative opponeints (Rainald Knightly and Howard Vyse) watch it very closely one of them will be unseated.
MALDON.-This wriU probably be the most severely contested borough election in Essex, the Conservative candidates having to contend against powerful local influence in addition to the combined efforts of a strong body of Liberals.
MAtOYLEBoE.-Nothing has occurred thus far to disturb the quiet of this borough, and to all appearances the old members will not be put to the trouble and expense of a contest. The nomination will take place on Friday.
MONMOUTHSPIP.LE-Mr. Octavius Morgan and Colonel Somerset, the late members, havo appealed to the county Toters, soHeiting re-election. There is no opposition.
MoNMO usTHSsRX BOstOUGcS.-Mr. Crawshay Bailey, the late member, has announced that he will stand for the nuited boroughs again. There is as yet no opposition. The LiberaLs of N ewport are very anxious to secure Dr. Nichol Carne as their candidate, but there is scarcely any expectation of a contest.
PLYouTm-(By Electric Telegraph.)-Yesterday evening Mr. John liardy, of Dunstall-hall, Burton-on-Trent, ironma8ter, appeared before the Conservative committee who resolved to present him to the constituency as a fitting person to represent the borough. Mr. Hardy is opposed to the baLlot, to the admission of Jews into Parliament, and to Lthe grant to Mynooth, and in favour of a modification of ehurch-rates, the equahixatien of church livings, and an P energetic prosecution of the war with China.
PRISTON.-Tho committee for conducting the election of Sir George Strickland have passed a formal resolution not to ebgage at remuneration any person whose name stands in the borough list of voters, and have paid off the lisited nulmber of canvassers whose services have been already rendered. A similar arrangement is expected to be made bythefriendsof Mr. GrenfeL There are rumours of an attempt at coalition between the supporters of the two Liberal members.
ST. IVES (CORNWALL).-A requisition, numerously signed, was forwarded to Mr. Coulson, of London s,I
Xenegi (Cemrnwai), injtng him to becoie a candidate for

STAJFORDSHIRJ (SOuTr).-_Th, friends of the Hon. Arthur Wrottegley do not seem content to abide by the de. cision of the mMeeting of electors which was reported in The Times on Monday. Mr. Wrotte4sve is now in the field as athird candidate. He issued his.aadriystrd...er noon. In it Mr. Wrottesley . y ayter.
"Yos aren raed uon to doeide whether the Goernment of Lord Pal?nerston or that of Lord Derby, reioroed by Mr. Gladstone and hi, friends, iS mot entitled to the suffra o the oountry.

TIVERTOX.-Thlere is no prospect of a contest in this borough. Lord and Lady Palmerston are expected to arrive on T'hursday. The nomination takes place on Friday.
WELLS.-Mr. Hayter is on a visit to his constituents, and is pursuing an active canvass in conjunction with Mlr. Edward Webster, wlio announces himself a warm advocate of Lord Palm-rston's policy. Captain Jolliffe, the late Coniservative member, is in the field.
W1LnT (SOUTH).-Mr. Sidney Herbert has issued his addressto theelectorsof South Wilts. Afterreferringtothe domestic reforms which preceded the War with Russia-a war at oncejust; politic, and necessary, and marked at its commencement by a series of victories such as have seldom, if ever, illustrated the first campaigns of our wars, and terminated by a peace which on the whole secured all the ob. jects for which the war was undertaken, the right hon. gentleman proceeds to say .-
' Though giving a general support to Her tMajestya Government, I hase not suppresed my convictions when a measure appeared tome injurios to the interests or inconsistent with the honour of our country. On such oscasiona while refosing to enter into any pty oDmbination whatever, I have cot been deterred by taunts or calusinies-the 'falsehoods of a day,'-from uteing to that w hich I thought wrong a fearless and outspoken opposition. In the Chinese discusion we had two questions to decide :-I, Whether distant oM. cais are to have the power not only of Drotecting our flag from insult, whidch Is indispensable, but of lev)ing war, and Impo3ing fresh hurdens on the people, In deDiance of the warnings of succesive Secretaries ot ate , including Lord Palmerston himwelf 2, Whether an offiial is justified in advancing a pretext whichahis owR previos despatch shows to be untrue. I maintained that the poople of England have a right to be consulted before their blood and treaem are to be spen and that the man who ms3erts in the nameof the Crown what appears from his oewn letter to be untrus is unfit to reprepent the Queen and the truth-loving People of England I urged the sending out immedlite reinforcements, In order to crush the war by an overwhelming superiority of force and the appointment of aman of weight and chracter to take the mangoment of the war and the negotiations out of the hand, of Sirs John Dowring. I am giad to ap that both ae now being donoe. Many with whom I generally act, and for whose motive3 I hbve the highest respect, arrived *T a different oonclusion from myself; I regret that wevsbould differ, but I, too, voted on the merits of the cse alone, with a strong conviction of right, and without any party object or combination whatever. To any meamure, however, whether brought forwvard by the Government or by Individmals, which apPeared to mo to be conducive to the publio welfare, I have given my heatty support. If retuned to Parlament, I shall oontinue the same course, further. insgalUweli-pondered reforms, and especially those measures for the better instruction and organization oftour armY which I beiievo to be necewy to Its efficlency. lookng upon them 11 urgent I have pressed them on ublilc attention, and I have now, at the Instance ot Ihe Government. undertaken the conduct of an inquiry into the whole ranitary system, and condition of the army, both at home and abroad, with a view to guard, so far as human precautions can avall, against the recrrence of evils from which we have so severely suffered. By liberal but moderate and enlightened legisation, and by the continuanc of the fiscal Policr which has reduced texation, while it has augmented our revenue, the wellbeing andDcontentment of the community can be best preserved: while abroad-a firm assertion of oar own rights, combined with ro. spect for the independence of other nations, and a scrupulous sdberence to good faith in our tr.nsactlona with the,_ will guarantee security and honour to British subjects and to the Brilish Bag throughout the world."
YO sR.-Colonel Smyth, Conservative, and Mr. Westhead, Liberal, addressed the electors on Monday evening. Mr. Westhead declared himself in favour of the ballot and of extended education, He would vote in favour of an alteration of the chnrch-rate system if some provision were nade for the maintenance of the fabric of the church, but he was unwilling to sanction the opening of places of amnusement on Sunday. HIe was also in favour of an alteration of the electoral districts, and, although not an advocate of grants for religious purposes, he was not prepared to vote against the grant to Maynooth. He regretted what had occurred at Canton, but on the whole he was prenared to support Lord Palmerston. Colonel Smyth expressed himself in favour of the Government on the China question. He was in favour of a Liberal-Conservative polc-Conservative as far as regarded our institutions and rights, and Liberal towards our people, our coloniesU and ourforeign friends. (By Electric Telegraph).-A third candidate has presented himself on the Liberal side in the person of Mr. M1alcolm, who was formerly connected with the administration of the law in India, and who has written works on the subject. He addressed the electors this evening in the open air. He is opposed to Lord Palmerston, and speaks indignantly of his Lordship's proceedings with regard to the Canton aha'.ir. He professes to be a Radical-Conservative, and states his objects in desiring to enter Parliament to be that he may take the place of MWr. Bright, and keep the India question before the public, A motion wras passed pledging the mcreting to support him at the hnsting.s. There is a rumour of another 'Tory candidate being brought forward.
YOstxsncItg (EAS3T RnIDItO,)-There is no opp'esition in this riding to the return of the old members-Lord Hotham and the Hon. A. Duncombe.
YOR1S;HIRF (NORT} RIDING.)--Ar the candidates (Mr. Cayley and the Hon. 0. Duncombe, the old members, and the Hon. J. C. Dundas) are vigorously prosecuting their canvass, and are addressing the electors in most of the principal towns in the riding. The contest wil be a most severe one as between MIr. Cayley and Mr. Dundes, and the resalt can only be determined by the closing of the poll. Mr. Duncombe, theoConservative candidate, will no doubt be returned.
SCOTLAND.
DuNDEE.-Mr. Armitatead, who, while absent in London, had been invited by a requisition of 700 electors to contest the representation of Dundee with Sir John Ogilvy, arrived at Dandee on Saturday, and in the evening issued his address. Mr. Armitstead is totally opposed to the MIaynooth grant (which is likely to be the turning point of the election) as well as to ecclesiastical endowments generally. He is favourablo to a large extension of the suffrage and to vote by ballot.
EDL'IPIIIGH.-The Daily pxpress states that strenuous efforts were made in the course of Saturday to induce Mr. Thackeray to come forward for theorepresentation of this city. In the evening, however, a telegraphic message was received, thanking the friends who had been in communicae tion with him, but stating that he thought the chances were too slender to warrant him in presenting himself at present. Air. Lawrence Oliphant was also thought of, but he is too hopeful of success in the Stirlingburghs to be induced to change his ground. It was supposed that if Sheriff Gordon could have been prevailed upon to postpone the Edinburgh election-day to the latest date. Lord John Russell, if defeated in London, might, by a sudden though late effort, have been carried for Edinburgb. As it is, however, the Edinburgh nomination is fixed for the same day as the London one. The late members, Mr. Cowan and MIr. Black, are therefore likely to be returned unopposed.
FryxssHInE.-On Saturday the rival candidates for this county addressed meetings of the electors in Kircaldy. Mr. John Fergus, the late member and the Liberal candidate, explained his views at considerable length, and expressed his confidence in Lord Palmerston and his Government. He said he believed that any reforms or improvements which wero demanded by matured public opinion would be given effect to by Lord Palmerston. He was a man of progress, and would not only be found not backward but a leacer in reform. Hle believed him to be a man who was more anxious to forward the interests of the country, and who wished for improvements in the Legislature more than any Minister we were likely to have. Lord Louuhborough, the other candidate, who professes himself a Liberal-Conservative, said, that while he thought our officers sbould have waited for instructions before attacking the Chineae, he should not have been one of the factious majority who voted against Lord Palmerston for the attack being made. He thought Lord Palmerston had acted in a thoroughly manly and British spirit in the matter.
KTLXBO5S A1,D CL;SCR,i%AXWN?.-It is thoupgt probable that Mr. Johnstone will yet withdraw his resignation and contest these counties with Lord hlelgund.
IRELAND.
THE NEw WRrrs.-The writs for the election of members to the next HlIuse of Commons have been received at the Hansper-office, and aweve forwarded on Monday evening to the several sheriffs and returning officers throughout the country.
ATHLO.NE: (BORoUGH).-The eBoman Catholic clergy of Athione have set the wishes of their bishop at naught. A cleriecl meeting was held on Sunday to discuss the merits of the three Liberal candidates, and, after some discussion, the question wa9s put to the vote, when the folowing was declared to be the result :-Ennis, 29; Grehoa (Dr. Browne's nominee), 5; Irwin, 4; Mr. John Ennis being thus pronounced dignifsimus. Messrs. Grehon and Irwin gracfully retire.l. The contest now lies betweett Captain Hancock and Mr. Ennis.
CAtRicKtFrEGus (BOROUGH).- Colonel Fergusn has retired, and the great struggle will noW be between Mr. M'Donough, Q.C., Peelte, and Mr. Dobbs, Derbyite. Mr. Mh'Mahon, moderate Conservative, is also in the field, and has many warm supporters.
CAVAN (COUNiTY).-Mr. Robert Burrowes has Clo9 his brief Parliamentary career. After fighting the Derbyite battle a couple of years back, and signally defeati'g r
Henry George R ughes. the ex-SolictorGeneral of the Russll 31inistry, Ur. Burrowes retires from public life. The Hon. Captain Hugh Annesley, of the Fusilser Guards and one of the heroes of the Al-na, is the now Conservative candidate. The Liberals speak of Mr. Hercule BUlis and Mr. O'Reilly, but the state of the registry holds out but littla prospect of success for candidates professing their poll. ticol principles.
izCLwL.-Thc, Zowervtative party in the borough ha-e
put Mfr. 'Ihomss H. Barton in nomination, with the iew o( Iounting Mr. John Dagwell, the late L:.beral member.
~(CORT; ). -The Hon. Colonel Huchkinson's addresa Is published in the local papers of Monday. Avowing himin f * Conservative of all that is good and useful, he neverthelow hals the near settlement of rho vexed question of ninisters' money, and professes to be an ardent advo6xte of civil and' religions liberty. Not long since the expression of such Sentiments from a metmber of the houseof Donoughmorewotl
have been accepted as genuine by any Liberal oonstituency in Ireland. In these later days, however, politicians' idea of civil and religions liberty are frequently so restricted ag to mean anything or nothing.
DowN, CouNTY.-MIr, D. S. Ker, 0no of the late Conservative members for the county, in the course of his address soliciting a renewal of the confidence of the constituency, thus alludes to the course he took upon the Cobdenl motion:-
" I abstained froma recording myr ot.e on a recent occason, because, altbough I cannot dereud the acts of our authorities at Canton, I war not prepared to give a vote of want of oonfidenoe in the Government for supporting their officials in that distant coantry pending the existOnce of hostilities. On the yrospnt occasion, when the Government appeal totbe deciion of thecountry, I cannot think that they should be judged by thetr cooduct on tbe Chinese queation alone, bat on the Whole of their foreig policy: wbetber tbey have oshow vigour and abUity in the mnanagement of the war, and whether the result is satiactory to the country? Upon this isue I am repared to acknowledge their services, aud I do not see that, in the presnt state of Europe. their servic eould be easily replaced."
DOwNI'ATRICK, BOROUOII.-Ir. H. Waring has stared as the Conservative candidate for the borough. There are now four claimants in the field, including Mr. Kirk, the late member.
DUBLIn UsrvEiuScTY.-The JMail of Monday Is author. ized to announce that a fifth candidate will immediately seek the suffrages of the electors. The name has not yet transpired, bht he is represented to be a stanch Conservative, whose political opinions are well known, having sat im Parliament for several years. Should Mr. A. Lefroy be the gentleman here indicated, the seat of one of the late members would be seriously endangered. The Rev. Dr. Jaxmes S. Blackrwood, one of the honorary secretaries for condchting the election of Mr. Wilcon, has addressed a remarkable letter to one of the Dublin journals in reference to the respective claims of Lords Palmerston and Derby upon the confidence of the Protestant party. Here 4> a few extracts :
" Druing the last few years, being in oonnexion with the committee of religious liberty, Presided over by Lord Shafttsbury, I have had a good deal to do with that question in Sweeden, Frane, Germany, and Turkey. In Constantino pile I waited on the Grane Vliner anud ouad Pasih, MInlasterfor Foreign Affairs, rith the Parismemoriat to the Suites from the dolecates of many nations and churobes. This reat question was Powerfully urged by Lord Palrneritones Govermment, and In consequence religions liberty of the most glorious kind has been establisbed in Turkey. But throughout the entire continent of Europe, I know a ud it Is notorious, that ths name of Lord Palmerston is one agsociated with the beat interesb of that high ani holy cause. All Europe knows It weL And all over Europe the friends of liberty would sigh,and the despots of soul rejoiee at tho downfall of Lord Palmerston, an4 the advent of Lord Derby and his present party to power in this ermpire. In tils interests of Evangelical religion at horne I equally find Lord Palmer ston's policy on the right side and Lord Derby's on the wrong. Look. ing at the late Evangelical promoters in the Church, it ih erident that Lord Palmerston hba adopted a ieoded eourse favourable to prre rell. glon, and antagonistic to the Oxford party. Looking at the vote on the ChIln questionin tho ifouno of Lords I finrt both the Euglish Archbishops, at the head of the Evangelical host, voting with Lord Palmerston, snd the three Puseyite biehopsExeter. Oyford, and Salisbury, voting with Lord Derby. Ia tbe souse of Commoros it is notorious that tbe recent Chinese majority was ga Ined by a ooaUition with Mr. Gladstone andthoPustyite paLty. Idle attemptsare madetodenythisncolition. and to assert the theory ot f rorcuitous concourse of atoms. But in London the thing is well known. There were Derby mactings before tbe voto was resolved on; Mr. Gladstone's acceion was announood; the resoiution was then taken, and the deed was done. And now Orford oomes forward in favour of ,3r. Gladstoes; even Idr. Naplers'
paper heresmakes aspoint to sireak favourably ofthim Lord Derby sneers at the Erangelicsl men lately promoted by Lord Palmerston, as IThe platform clergy.' And MIr. Disraeli, in his manifesto recently put forth, plainly shows that the Derby policy is jurt to put them down, Sir. I*feel asured that the interests of Pssoyism and of mere Derbyism peromptorily demanded this coums. Their necessities were urgent The policy of Lord Palmerston was sending new life-blood into ths church of England. and was winning gradualy to his standard many of the be3t of the Derbyite party. That same policy was just entering into Ir eladu mdpr Lord Carlisle. Puseyism took fright. The tempting, bait was held out to the Derby partyb they swrallowved it, and are it the snare. As betore, to ita great damae, they linked Protestantism to the dying b:dy of Proteetion; so now they have tied it to the offeonsivecarcases otfPusyisin, to gs greater damage stiL l.be truth is that the Earl of Derby, Nr. Disraeli, and otber leaders aLnd memners of that party areto more Protestants than they are angels. And what they are not, so is not their policy. Abroad their sympatbies are with the despotsat home with the Puseyites. Why, then, sbould our Protestant representatives be of their party ? Wby should they thrust Lord Palmerston out of ofilco. who. w hatevcr his defect, wms doing wel for reglgus liberty abroad, and for evangelical religion at home, and seek to bring in Lord Derby to the great peril of both ? This is the plain state of the question. and therefore I depreeate the return of two sepresentatives for our Pro testant Univeriity. boutd by party ties to oppose *te mau whose enltzhtened policy we so far approve; and to bring Into pooer othera whose chief object wil be, a* Mr. Dis raeli plaily declare,, to d stroy that very portion of Lord Palmer: ston's rwork whi-h commands our derided approbationL I trust, therefore, that the Evangelical clergy and laIty will consider these matters lu the light of principle. To Mr. Napler peroonally I have no objection. I admire big legal talents, and heartily wish he were sately on the bench, which be wo idd so well ador. But in Parliament he has proved himself a better partisan than politician. Mr. Bntt,hin supporting Lord PAlmersten, esincel a keener peroeptloniofcthe real cbaracter of the concacted CObina vote. and a sounder and wider view of the interests of liberty and Pro testantism, lu voting for Lord Palrnerston he votedvirtually for tbese. Our representatives, inTvoting against him,Tvoted virtually for the advance of Puseyism-thastmoet isidious enemy of vangelical religion and liberty."
GALW,AY (COUNTY).-It was stated in Tuam yesterday (Monday) that Captain Bellew had withdrawvn in consequence of his addreas not meeting with the approval of the most influential personage in the county, to whom he submitted the document. Another statement was put in circulation at a later hour, that he had been induced, in consequence of a modification of opinion respecting him, to reconsider his withdrawal. Sir Thomas N. Eedington, who has entered the lists for the honour of representing the county, arrived in the town of Tuam in the course ofthe morning, and at once proceeded with his canvass.
LI3EiCXICl (CITY).-Major Gavin has retired, so that in. all likelhhooa lr. F. W. Russell and Serjeant O'Brien will have a quiet walk over the course.
LOXOFOrSD (COUNTVY).-The Liberal Club-composed almost wholly of Roman Catholic clergymen-met on Monday for the purpose of deciding upon the claims of the several candidates for the representation. After a stormuy discus-ion a division was taken, and Colonel Greville and 3Mr. Hughes, the late members, were elected by a majority of nearly two to one. The Hon. Captain Forbes, brother of the rArl of Granard, then retired from the contest, bht Colonel Henry White still means to press his claims.
SLIGO (CouNTY).-A letter froni Tuam states that Mr. Swift, accompanied by the Very Rev. Dr. O'Connor, P.P., Lougliglynn, arrived in that town on a visit to the archbishop, previous to proceeding to canvass the electors of Sligo, whose suffrages he intends to seek for the coming election. Mr. Swift had an interview with the Bishop of Achonry, by whom ho was most warmly received, and by whom he will be most strenuously supported in the renewal of the trust which the electors of Siigo placed inL his hands at the last election.

LONDON, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 25, 1857.
The Administrative Reformers want an Administrative Reform, and, as with charity, they must begin at home. Should they ever advance far enough in the cause we Btrongly recommend three measures :-First, that they get rid of their Chairman; secondly, that they dismiss their Council; thirdly, that they dissolve their Association, and reconstruct it on a principle which will exclude aU the existing members. This wiU be a radical reform, and nothing less wifi meet the requirements of the case. They have published an Address to the Electors of the United Kingdom, which illustrates aU the vices incident to administration. It is not to the purpose or to any purpose. It is not to the occasion. It is inconsistent alike with the professed objects of the Association and the notorious practice of its members. These are aU vital defects, and they are the very defects which lie at the root of aU bad administration. This subject has been lately explored wvith remarkable unanimity and zeal, and the conclusions we have all come to may be regarded as political axioms. Bad administration consists not only in the bad quality of the men or the things, but also, and still more, in a general neglect of fitness as to men, things, offices, operations, places, and times. A good man is in a bad place, a dull man is in a place that wants a ready one, an ingenious man in a place that requires a hardworking one, a talker in a place that requires a ready reckoner, a warrior is at a desk, a diplomatist at the head of an army. What was wanted last month 4,000 miles off is only ready just now in London. The fleet has an abundance of what the army wants, and the army is put to the work of the fleet. Everywhere there is a misfit, and just as the effect of a very handsome dress is entirely spoilt by an unsightly gap of half an inch in a critical place, so the greatest preparations are disjointed and neutralized by the omission of one important link. This is the chief fault of administration, and it is one which makes good men, good materials, good everything, worse than useless. But this is the very characteristic most prominent in the Address before us. It confounds al proprieties, and assures us that the writers, as wel as the persons on behalf of whom it is written, are the best to be intrusted with the administration of public affairs.
The Address comes from an Association for Administrative Reform. Now, Administrative Reform is one thing, Constitutional Reform another; and the greater part of the Address is on the latter subject, not the former. What is far more serious, or rather more ridiculous, is that the Address advocates certain constitutional theories expressly in preference to any nicety in the selection of men. A Council of Administrative Reformers ought to take the present opportunity of pointing out the personal merits of statesmen, of doing justice to those who have proved themselves good administrators, and the demerits of those who have proved themselves bad ones. It ought to sitrip theorists of their practical pretensions, and instill the maxim that a good man is a good man, and will be a good man, under whatever system he may be appointed. On the contrary, these Administrative Reformers send the electors into the clouds about Extension of the Suffrage, the Ballot, and more equal Electoral Districts,-that is, to a reform in our representation, not in our administration; and most emphatically adjure the electors not to listen to "any declarations, however vehement, in favour "of any particular men, or of any particular "Administration." Now, we can imagine Parliamentary Reformers maintaining, with some consistency, that no statesmen can be trusted, and no good expected, till the prime motive of the machine had been set right by a reform of the representation; but Administrative Reformera cut their own ground from under themselves when they tell people that the form of the constitution is everything, the character of the statesman nothing; when they deliberately ask people not to look at a man's actions, but at the merits of a theory. These Administrative Reformers, indeed, convict themselves out of their own mouths, for, immediately after entreating the electors not to listen for an instant to the actual merits of any particular men, or of any particular Administration, they return to their own legitimate topic of complaint, that " the fitting man is not the man sought after "and chosen." Fxample, however, is at all times lb*ik. than. . eept, .imcl ke dotrine that
fit men ought to be' iought after and chosen for responsible offices would have come with much more grace had it not been immediately preceded by a still more earnest exhortation not to care a bit for the life and character of the most responsible servants of the CROWX, who have to choose and superintend all the rest, but only to ask their theory of the representation.
The Administrative Reformers are, indeed, involved irrecoverably in some curious inconsistencies, which they have honesty enough to betray, but not quite honesty enough to confess or avoid. The leading men among them, including the Chairman, whom we suppose to be also the author of this Address, have done their best to turn out a Government of good administrators and bring in some Government or other that would certainly include administrators not so good. Thus they have shown that, after all, they feel much more interest in a particular question than in Administrative Reform. Indeed, they care for everything-IJniversal Suffrage, Ballot, the Chinese, and we know not what besides, more than they do for the professed object of their Association. But, having thus by their acts confessed a greater interest in the Chinese question than in Administrative Reform, and a stronger desire to tun out good administrators than to improve the Administration, they beseech the electors not to do as they have done themselves,-not to make the Chinese question the turning point of the present crisis. Thus, being professedly Administrative Reformers, they assist to bring about a dissolution upon China, in order to compel a general election neither upon the one subject nor the other, but upon a third,viz., Parliamentary Reform, in consideration of which they earnestly exhort electors to send the other two questions to the winds. Again, the step which their chief men have just taken has a natural tendency, though happily no more than a tendency, to bring again into power certain statesmen who made a signal default of administration in the late war. This, of course, was rather in the face of their own professions, and the default is so recent, and so great, that they are obliged to give it a place in their present Address. Thus the most fearful instance of maladministration in our time, and with which they are obliged to "point " their moral and adorn their tale" in the present Address, was perpetrated by statesmen whom they have just been doing their very best to bring back to power over the heads of a confessedly superior Administration. Here is a dilemma for a man with a conscience, or even the least idea of consistency. The Address gets over it, or rather under it, by laying the maladministration entirely to the charge, not of the statesmen whom Messrs. ConzDE andRoEBucnarefor bringing back to power, but of the " system"-the system, namely, of not caring for a man's personal merits, which system the Address had just before earnestly recommended to the electors.
All these inconsistencies happen to be unavoidable in this instance, and the writer of the Address had them staring in his face as much as a man about to cross from Dover to Calais in a rough day has before him certain disagreeable incidents of the voyage. He knows the horrors of the sea, and he only thinks how he can abate some of them. But there is one further inconsistency which is quite gratuitous, and which the writer must have plunged into from mere foolhardiness. Mr. CoBDnE and his friends have lately taken to criticizing, with a tone of quiet superiority, the oratorical powers not only of men in Parliament, but of men aspiring to it. Several times Mr. COBDEN has assured his provincial hearers that such and such a man might be honest and able, but that he made a very poor figure in debate; and at Manchester he went so far as to describe by anticipation the contemptible appearance of two gentlemen in the House whom he could not deny to be men of good sterling qualities. On the contrary, what do we find in this address,-" The flip"pant declaimer, the noisy and fluent speaker of " a hustings oration, does not by his ready utter"ance and unblushing audacity thereby prove "himself to be worthy of the confidence of his "countrymen. If a man have proved himself by "his past life to be diligent in the inquiry after "knowledge; if he have given proof of his moral " worth, if he be a strict adherent to the "cause of truth, he may be a worthy represent"atiye, though not possessed of the ready fluency
of a practised debater, or the artful sophistry of a trained advocate." This is all very true, even though it may seem to disparage qualities indispensable to the conduct of debate; but the advice, rather out of place here, would have been perfectly in place several times within the last fortnight, had it been given to Mr. COnDEN when he was raising a laugh in crowded meetings at the expense of men of moral worth and intellectual power, though without "ready utterance and unblushing auda" city," and "not possessed of the ready fluency " of a practised debater, or the artful sophistry of " a trained advocate."
An undignified dispute has been followed by an
An undignified dispute has been followed by an impotent demonstration. The Austrian Minister at the Court of Turin has been recalled, and the Sardinian Minister been dismissed fromVienna. We have no hesitation in saying that this is an event to be lamented-a mistake to be as soon as possible rectified. None but those who rejoice in every complication, through a belief that bickering must end in revolution, and revolution in the re-establishment of their own political systems, can find anything to rejoice at in this new diplomatic squabble; and not even the most visionary devotee of Democracy or the Nationalities can really expect any good to his cause from so sorry a contest. Ilis withdrawing of Ambassadors, which has come into fashion of late years, is a most unsatisfactory mode of proceeding. True, there is something analogous in private life. As people are no longer allowed by public opinion to fight duels when offended, they are forced to content themselves with dropping each other's acquaintance. But nations cannot carry out such a practice. The world is large enough for two angry gentlemen, who need never visit at the same houses or recog,nize one another should they meet by accident. But two frontier States, connected by language and business, with diligences and railway trais running daily from one into the other, can no more refuse to communicate officially than they can widen the river which divides them to the dimensions of the Atlantic. Ministers are not sent merely as a compliment from Sovereign to Sovereign, but to transact important business and be ready for emergencies which may arise at any moment. To withdraw a Minister, then, merely as a mode of testifying personal displeasure, and without any definite ulterior intentions, is certainly a course as little reasonable as can possibly be imagined.
The history of this affair is briefly told. For nine years the feeling between Vienna and Turin has been bitter in the extreme. The Austrian Empire has been during this period plunged in anarchy and threatened with disraption ; it has been saved, and, by the efforts of a central despotic Power, restored to its former high place in the European commonwealth. In the same way, Sardinia has been beaten and disgraced, to be again raised to a high pitch of prosperity and military glory. But all through the tVwo States have preserved their animoditie; and the succeas of eaclh has been ino.
.tification to. the other. The progres of events made them allies, but not the less enemies. As they could not indulge their hostile impulses by a foray across the border, they were obliged to -have recourse to little demonstrations, which will awaken no sympathy in this country. Where the Sovereign is so entirely the State the personal com4punications of Royalty are not distinguished from the political relations of the countries. So, the Imperial and the Royal Family have for the last three years been putting petty alights on each other. When King Vicron ENrnLi-uz lost three near relatives within a very short period the ExtPERoR neglected to send his condolences. On the other hand, when FRANCIS Josxpa visited his Italian dominions the Sardinian Court declined to congratulate him on his arrival in the neighbourhood of the frontier. We have already expressed our opinion on these last events, and regretted that the Sardinian SoVERXION and people should have taken such an opportunity for testifying the permauence of their hostility. The despatch of Count BuOL was the result. The Sardinian press was charged with the direct offence, but the Government was declared to have allowed, and even instigated, its excesses. Count CAvourt replied effectively, aa, indeed, he might well do, for his opponent wrote angrily and weakly, and gave him every advantage.
Then followed the last act of the quarrel. The Austrian ExErxnon imagined that he had been misrepresented and insulted, and that his dignity was at stake. It was not a thing to fight about.-it was not a thing to call a Conference about; so he withdraws his Minister. This withdrawal, we are assured, will be followed by no other demonstration. A rupture of diplomatic intercourse was the only resource for a Sovereign who had been treated with contumely. But the Austrian EbmrPxor wil not disturb the peace of Europe. He will proclaim his sense of the impropriety of VicToR EzL%rAr'-ues conduct, and that will suffice. Now, in this kind of language we recognize something wholly alien from our habits of political reasoning. Through the whole of the dispute and correspondence we find the Government one with the personality of the EMsr,non. There is nothing abstract about the Austrian State; it is angry and susceptible, it is affronted by the neglect of a formality, and revenges itself by the scolding of a despatch. In fact, the E.Nxirion and his personal feelings sway the Imperial policy in a manner of which we in this country can have little conception. Here is one of the weaknesses of absolute Government. Despotism has its elements of strength, as its partisans from MIadrid to Moscow are never weary of pointing out. It can act strongly, swiftly, steadily. It has no people to conciliate, no assemblies to satisfy. Faction or false hurnanity cannot cavil if it displays energy abroad. But it is cursed with a personality. It cannot help being incarnate in some self-willed, uncontrollable nature; it must obey the impulses of an individual or family. IHere we see Austria making a false step because the State cannot be separated from the Sovereign. It is not for the interest of the Empire to take notice of petty slights, to resent the attacks of foreign newspapers, or the solecisms of foreign Court etiquette, and, were there under any form an independent Power in the Empire, the Cabinet of Vienna would not be allowed to make such things important, while the limitation of the EsMrinoies responsibility would enable him to remit with dignity the affair to the judgment of his subjects. But as it is, an insult to the Monarch is, in continental politics, an attack on the Empire, and must at all hazards be noticed and retorted.
We have said that the Austrian Government has committed an error in this affair. In the first place,.it has made an undignified display of temper, and assumed an attitude which may entail some further demohstration. In the second, it has given an advantage to Russiaa new enemy, but which hates it as if with the gathered animosity of a thousand years. We have not the high notion of Rlussian diplomacy which prevails in some quarters; the tact of Pozzo Di BoRnGo and NEssmRoDE seems to have departed, and a school of grosser intriguers to have succeeded. But whatever may be the success of the schleme, there seems but little doubt that the Russians have been for some time endeavouring to cajole the Sardinian Court and to inilame its animosity against Vienna. The counsels of France and England will probably be sufficient to prevent such influences having any important effect ; but if the Russians can disquiet or even annoy Austria they wil fancy it something gained. It is not filial devotion alone which brings the Grand Duke CoNsTAwrms to visit his mother at Nice, both having made a circuit to avoid the Austrian territory; it is not an interest in history alone which causes the latter after the fetes of Turin to visit the battle-field of Marengo, and remark on the coward;ce of an Austrian division. Austria has nothing to gain by an open rupture with an Italian Power. As long as she retains a dignified attitude she will have the support of England and France; but the Cz.uR calculates, and FRANCIS JosErn ought to know, that a contest in Italy would alienate whatever sympathies the recent conduct of Austria has caUled forth. We trust, therefore, that the Cabinet of Vienna wiU reconsider the policy it seems to have resolved upon, and not begin in wantonness or pique a strife which may end in calamities now unforeseen.
The judgment of the Judicial Committee of
The judgment of the Judicial Committee of Privy Council in the case of "LwDzr v. WESTER" TON" WVil put the High Church party in good spirits again. Crosses, credence-tables, altar-cloths of every variety of colour for all the ecclesiastical seasons, protected and sanctioned by the Privy Council, and Mr. WESTERTOx charged with his own share of the costs of all three courts-a useful hint to aU entlhusiastic Churchwardens to be cautious in assuming the office of ecclesiastical prosecutors,-such a judgment will almost Erastianize High Churchmen, who wiUl fall into the grievous heresy of thinking that laymen may make as good judges as Bishops on Church questions.
The Protestant public, however, need not be alarmed. The Privy Council is still Protestant. Any one who will read this judgment may see that for himself; but, as exceedingly few wil do that, we will just tell them what the judgment is, and they will see what a great fuss may be made about a few simple points, which any three gentlemen of ordinary good sense could have settled by five minutes' conversation. WVe do not mean in saying this to reflect at al upon the judges of the Courts below. The truth is, when questions are once stirred up, the water must be muddy before it is clear again. That is almost a law of nature. GeneraUy speaking, the first result of what is called " thinking over" any subject to yourself is simply to puzzle yourself; you are not only not benefited, but considerably worse off for your pains. You have left the daylight of simple, natural common sense, and got into a dark intellectual chamber of your own making, in which you go groping about with the help of small apertures and passage windows. When you emerge out of this glooiu you are sometimes, indeed, the gainer by your experience, and regain your common, ense, with the addition of soie clearness and Wuracy ; but itis not true that second thoughts " best. a1ke proverb has made a Inistake,in. i1a aritbh=&*; it is not scovLd
thoughts, but third thoughts, that are best. The fitst -nd the last states are good, the mriddle i bad' In the present case any person of average intelligence could have settled these questions in five minutes by the light of common sense. But common sense is disturbed and muddied when law first comes in, and we fnd ourselves in an atmosphere of legal distinctions and technicalities. This is the unfortunate second stage in which the Courts below have taken up the question, and we emerge from it to the daylight of common sense again in the judgment of the Committee of Privy Council. But the Courts below have not been without their use, though they have been unlucky in the stage of the process which has fallen to their lot. There must be pioneers to deal with the rubbish of a case, and get it out of the way before the road is made. Every important question should pass through the stage of fermenting, after which the irrelevant matter settles and goes to the bottom, and the liquor is clarified.
First in order comes the question of the cross, and its use as a symbol or ornament in the church. Now, any one going simply by common sense would have seen, to begin with, a distinction between the use of the material cross, as an appendage to the Church service and ritual, and the use of it merelv as an architectural ornament and emblem in our churches. The latter use is justified by universal custom; it is retained in our orders of knighthood; it comes down to us, as this judgment remarks, with the whole sanction of the primitive Church, long before the errors of Rome had crept in, and, in fact, nobody objects to it. But so overwhelming is the obscuring power of law in the first instance, that this very simple distinction was wholly lost sight of in the judgments of Dr. LUSuN-OTON and Sir Jo}nT Doi)soN, who involved this symbolical ornament in the meshes of a particular rubric, out of which it was never extricated in the Courts below. The rubric which has had such an important place in this discussion is this:-
" And here it be noted that snch ornaments of the church, and of the ministers thereof, at all timos of their ministry, shaU be retained and be in use as were in this Church of England by authority of Parliament in the second year of King EDWARD VL"'
Connecting the use of the cross with this rubric, the judges set to work to find out what ornaments of the church were sanctioned by Parliament in the second year of EDWARD VI., and could not find anything about them in any Acts. Then they went to contemporary writings for evidence what church ornaments were or were not considered orthodox at that time, and they discovered that the cross, having been abused for superstitious purposes in Roman Catholic times, was objected to as a church ornament by various prelates of the Reformation. But, on examination, it is quite evident that this rubric and this evidence connected with it have nothing whatever to do with architectural ornaments and emblems in our churches, the " ornaments of the Chlrch" referred to being ornaments connected with the service and ritual of the Church, and such as were actually made the subject matter of superstitious ceremonies, such as that of " creeping to the " cross" on Good Friday, when the congregation crawled on the ground to a large cross which was set up. Ve have abundant evidence from the Royal proclamations of that day that authority put down " misused images, with pilgrimages,
clothes, stones, shoes, offerings, kissings, candle" sticks, trinkets of wax, and such other like"and among the rest crosses, as used in a particular way, and accompanied with certain ceremonies and rites. But all such evidence as this against the use of the cross was wholly irrelevant, considering the cross simply as an architectural ornament, and theCommittee of PrivyCouncil has framed its judgment on this point in accordance with this consideration. It has reverted to the plain distinction of common sense, which stared us in the face before we got into the first obscurity of law, and it has pronounced that the cross onl the screen in St. Barnabas is legal, as being simply an architectural decoration. The cross, however, fastened to the communion table in the same church has come under its prohibition, as interfering with the nature of a " table" which has to be " covered " with a clotb," which it could not be with an erect cross fastened upon it. Such an erection would suit an altar, but not a communion-table.
The subject of the " credence-table" comes next. This is a very simple matter. The rubric directs that at a certain point in tle course of the Communion Service, the minister shall place the bread and wine upon the communion-table. Where, then, must they be placed before they are placed on the communion-table? " Nothing," says the judgment of the Judicial Committee, " seems less ob"jectionable than a smaU side table, from which " they may be conveniently reached by the offi"ciating minister, and at the proper time trans" ferred to the communion-table." But, because this was called a " credence-table," many excellent people felt genuine alarm-an alarm which we hope the Judicial Committee has dispersed by simply stating what a credence-table is. The question of altar-cloths, and whether there may be more than one, and whether they may have different colours, is decided on an equally simple principle. The canon orders a covering of silk, or of some other proper material. From this it was unaccountably inferred in the Courts below that the canon, " not mentioning more than one " covering, byimplication excluded it." "But,"says the judgment of the Privy Council, " their Lord" ships are unable to adopt this construction. An " order that a table shall always be covered with a " cloth surely does not imply that it shall be always " covered with the same cloth, or with a cloth of " the same colour or texture." Such is the material out of which this great ecclesiastical contest is composed, which has gone through three Courts, amid the excitement of a large party in the Church. Let us hope that both sides will now be quiet for a time; and when the congregations of St. Paul and St. Barnabas celebrate, as they doubtless will in the ensuing Easter, their triumph over Mr. WasrTXRToN, let them remember that for the liberty of having crosses and credence-tables, as much black as they like in Lent, and as much red, crimson, and all colours of the rainbow as they like in
Easter, they are indebted, not to the Court of their Bishop, or to the Court of their Archbishop, but to HXnp M sArTy in Council, represented by the LosD CANCELLo;, the CHANCXLLOR of the Duciy of CORNWALL, two ex-Judges of the Courts of Queen's Bench aud Common Pleas, and a late Baron of the Exchequer.
A hideous case has just been tried at Exeter;
A hideous case has just been tried at Exeter; the report of it might have been seen in our impression of Monday. It involved no point of law ; we know not that it can be drawn in any way into a precedent. If we notice it at all it is simply because it discloses one of those fearful tales of cruelty which the imagination of our most practised retailers of horrors could scarcely have conceived. The master of a merchaut abip, in conjunction with the mate, murdered in cold blood, and with every circumstanco of torture, a wretched negro who acted as cook on board t3ja vesiel. The ship was of 120 tons burden. In Felruary of last year sho sailed from London to Nevmastle, and, having taken a. cargo of coals on bo i, made sail for Senegal, thence to Cape Ye fde laands, on tg RIo Graude, andu ihe back
Ito} Rgland. Nvox Oini wAs the name of ther
'Master, cone ATw - was mnate, and the wretibeo. creitrre wdho was so foully murdered was namei E,DwARs2 Dzsvuz. He was a negro, a native of Boston, in the United States. It appeared1 by the testimory of the witnesses that the ill-treatment which led to his death commenced at; the Cape Verde Islands. The master went on shore there one day, and returned on the next. As soon as he came back he called the cook into the cabin, knocked him down, and kicked him about the body. A few days afterwards the mater beat him with a broomstick about the legs. Then. the master thrashed him with a rope, then he knocked him down, then he beat him with a. handbrush. This was chance work, howevermerely preliminary to the systematic course of' frightful brutality which only ended in the unfortunate negro's death. The master, HUGH ORR, made a "cat," and when this was made he was in the habit of calling down the black into the little cabin of the Hannah Jane. He, would then knock him down, and belabour the wretched creature with the instrument of torture. In order to indulge in this exercise more at hiis ease, it appeared that he tried to tie his victim up by passing two half-hitches or loops over his thumbs, and when the master was unable to accomplish this by his own unassisted efforts he called in the assistance of the mate. Between them they would tie the eook up to the locker, and then flog him to their heart's content. The witnesses who testified to these facts were, mainly, the cabinboy, and a seaman, one TuouAs APPLEBY, wlho was one of the crew of the Hannah Jane. The last witness said that frequently at night, when he was at the wheeI, he heard cries of agony issuing from the cabin where the torture was in progress. The night before that on which the negro died this man saw the master and the mate flogging him. They had lashed him down to a chest by his thumbs, sob that his back was rounded, and then they gave him 350 lashes and upwards. A few days before this he had been lashed up to the fore rigginghis heels higLhr than his head-and in this position had been flogged by the mate. The two ruffians had ordered the poor creature's back to be scrubbed, while it was one mass of sores and bruises. It is ri,ght to mention, as considerable weight was laid on it in the course of the proceedings, that the night before the negro died the mate, ArWELL, saw him lying on the deck, and kicked him on the bresst with his heavy seaboots, and also struck him with a block. It became, then, a question whether these kicks and blows were not the immeediate cause of death. If so, as the master of a vessel is not criminally responsible for the acts of his mate, Hvuen ORR might have escaped scot free. Ther jury, happily, held otherwise, and found the ruffian. guilty of manslaughter, upon which the presiding judge instantly passed upon him a sentence of transportation for life. Had he been found guiltyof the capital offence, and suffered punishment accordingly, there would have been few who would have lamented his fate.
The case, of course, turned upon the degree of credit which could be attached to the testimony of the witnesses. We are ready to admit that a conspiracy of three or four persons to procure the condemnation of the master on board a small craft like the Hannah Jane is within the limit of probability. On board a larger vessel, with a more numerous crew, such an attempt must necessarily fail, for it would be impossible to procure the needful unanimity in perjury. Now, the company of the Haannalh Jane consisted of tha master, oUGH OBn, the mate, AT-wELL, three seamen, HARVER, FRAZER, and PHrLirps, but PHurIIPS deserted, and was replaced by JARVIS; CoNX, the cabinboy, and EDwARD DEvUE, the black cook. ATWELL, the mate, disappeared from the ship at Rio Grande, after the death of the cook. It must, of course, occur to every one's mind on the first blush of the matter as strange, that as soon as the Hannah Jane reached Rio Grande, where there was a British Consul, the seamen did not make such a complaint to that functionary as would have led to an investigation, and to the arrest of the master and mate. APPLEBY and HAnVEm stated. that they did make such a complaint, but that the Consul treated their application with something very like contempt, merely saying that he would write to England upon the subject. We think it highly improbable that the seamen did lay any formal complaint before the Consul. They no doubt went into his office and griumbled out something, which the Consul probably set down as mere evidence of a squabble between the master and the ship's company. As far as the Consul is concerned, the inquiry cannot stop here. The result of the trial at Exeter the other day proves that there was a terrible necessity for investigation at Rio, when the circumstances of the case were fresh in the minds of all; and the mate, whose conduct was inculpated equally with that of the master, was in the Consul's power. The investigation into the conduct of the Consul will, no doubt, be set on foot in the proper quarter. Passing from this point we find that the evidence upon which the, prisoner ORR was convicted of manslaughter was given by the two seamen APPLEBY and HARvXR, and by CoNN, the cabinboy. There had, moreover, been a dispute about wages between the master and these two seamen, APPLEBY and HAnvEz, when the ship arrived at Plymouth. It is, indeed, very probable that if ORiQ had not; fallen out with the men upon this point he, might have escaped prosecution altogether. Stil this was a point which; although it might affect the degree of credit which the jury might be disposed to attach to the statements of the two seamen, could do no more. CoNN, the cabinboy, was not cross-examined for the defence, and JARV1S waa not produced. The effort was, of course, to showr that the negro's death resulted from the acts of ATWELL, for which acts, unless under his ow. special order, the master, ORR, could not be held. responsible. The jury and judge, however, -uponx hearing the whole case came to the very sound. decision that, whatever might have been the guilt of ATWELL, ORR was equaUy answerable for the death of the unfortunate black. The story is a most horrible and disgusting ono, but we know not how the occasional occurrence of such
crimes is to be avoided, any more than the occa-
tional occurrence of murder upon shore. The rapid spread of steam navigation, and the consequent rapidity with which detection and convictionx must follow upon all such offences, may do mueh, -the growing tendency to use only large craft for long runs still more. We had hoped that; under the provisions of the modem Act for the Better Regulation of the Merchant Service we should cease altogether to hear of such acts of bratality on the part of the captains of the smaller merchant vessels, and things, no doubt, areli improved. After all, it is the owner who should be relly answerable, both to the seamen in hi& emplayment and to the public, for the choice of the master, in whose hands he places so much irrespo"sible power while the ship is at sea.

WASHINGTON, MARCe 3.
Mr. Buchanan, the President elect, arrived here last night; some preparations had been made to give him a public reception, which he evaded by timing bls arrival two hours before he was expected.
The inauguration takes place to-morrow, but, as the steamer for Earope sails before the commence. ment of the ceremonies, only a brief outline of the forms observed can be given. The Senate will assemble at noon; the President and the President elect will proceed together to the Senate-house, whence a procession will be formed across the Rotunda to the grand portico of the Capitol; there, surrounded by the members of the Senate, the diplomatic corps, the heads of departments and the judges of the Supreme Court of the United States, the oath of office will be administered to the new Prerident by the chief judge of that court. The President then delivers his inaugural address, which, it is understood, he is to-day occupied in completing. The space in front of the portico is allotted to the spectators and depu tations, many of them military, from different States. The proceedings are, in the fuUest sense of the word, public. The weather at present is unpromising, windy and bitterly cold. The city is crowded, and two or three large trains are expected in the course of to-day; the hotels and lodginghouses are full to excess. All this crowd is supposed to be anxious only to see the inauguration, but a large portion of it is still more anxious to see Mr. Buchanan after it is over. The number of office-seekers here at this moment is said to be iunmense. In the course of a week or two no small fraction of the population will consist of disappointed men. It is reported that Mr. Buchanan was obliged to secrete himself two or three days last week to avoid the importunities of the numerous politicians wishing to devote themselves to the service of their country. Tying up the knocker and positive denial of access to all were the only mode of escape. The penalty attached to the possession of such immense patronage is very severe.
The last week of an outgoing Administration and an expiring House of Representatives is naturaUy a busy one. The accumulation of work is most visible in the Legislature, where Bill piled on Bill awaits decision. The sittings have been continued lately almost through the day and night, and, after assembling to-day, Congress will hardly make any adjournment till to-morrow morning, which terminates the existence of the present House of Repro sentatives, and brings the new President into office.
The closing days of President Pierce's term have been rather remarkable for the events they have produced. The House of Representatives, for the frst time in its history, has exercised its power of expelling members of its body for corruption in disposing, or being ready to dispose, of their votes and influence for money. Strictly speaking, perhaps, it has not actually expelled the offending members, a3 they avoided the formal vote on the resolutions for their expulsion by resignng their seats. Virtually the effect is the same. They have been driven from the House by the opinion of the whole body, which supported the recommendation of the committee of inquiry with one exception. The members criminated by the report of the committee are MIr. Gilbert and Mr. Matteson, both representatives of the State of New York. In the case of a third member, Mr. Welch, of Connecticut, the House refused to confirm the recommendation of the committee. The evidence against the offenders does not prove any actual receipt of money, but something like negotiations that tended to induce persons to offer it. The measure that was to have been passed, and on the success of which the payment was contingent, fell through, and the agree ment was a failure; but the readiness to be bribed seems to have been proved, and for that the ex-members are punished. Rumour states that the committee by no means pitched on the strongest cases that could bo found. The correspondent of the New York- Times is deprived of the privilege of admission to the floor of the House, having used it, it appears, too effectively. The sentence of the House more than justifies what he stated; and the resolution excluding him is not nwotiv-the reasons of the censure are not explained.
The last public reception of Mr. President Pierce was held on the evening of the 27th. As everybody attended it there was an immense crowd; the ground-floor of the White House was filled till every apartment became so closely packed that it was difficult to move. There was agood band of music in the great east room and a few brilliant toilettes, but the crowding killed everything, and everybody appeared uncomfortable. There were no arrangements to keep the mass circulating in fixed directions, and opposingstreams of peoplepushed and squeezed each other in the doorways, to the ruin of hats and tempers. Some of themenwereperfectlybrutal, elbowing their way through all impediments to arrive-nowhere. Some ladies, of a provincial appearance, stood on the sofas, to obtain a better view of-nothing; and several juveniles, whose heads could not reach the air, were nearly suffocated in the throng. The crowd was so great that it choked its own object in coming, and looked puzzled to account for its assemblage. The President " receives" in a small room, a kind of side eddy of the torrent, and how many of the multitude saw him at all I cannot say; but certainly a small minority. The reception has actually grown to be impossible; though, perhaps, from the influx of strangers, this was more crowded than usual. The crowning confusion was in the recovery of coats and hats on departing,. The arrangements of this department were thoroughly official-that is, utterly inadequate for the purpose; tne one or two attendants in charge of the accumulation of garments were soon overpowered, and the crowd broke in and distributed them themselves. Everybody took what came to hand, and missing their own, rather than walk home in the cold, approprlat.d the wrappings of others. The worst event of the evening has still to be told :-a quarrel occurred between two gentlemen in the crush, which ended next morning in a murder. A Mr. Lee, a clerk in the Pension-office, suddenly accused a Mr. David Hume, a merchant, residing at Alexandria, of having stolenhispocketbook. Cards were exchanged, and Mr. Humethenextmorning,accompaniedby some friends, waited on Mr. Lee at the Pension-office to demonstrate the absurdity of the charge and ask its retractation. Mr. Lee would neither retract nor apologize, on which Mr. Hume, greatly irritated, caUed him a scoundrel, and struck him. Lee then drew a pistol and shot him. He died in a few seconds. As self-defence here justiies anything, and an armed man is supposed to feel his life in danger if a finger is laid on him, Lee will escape punishment; but it is generally believed he prepared for the meeting he
knew was to take place, and resolved to provoke the assault that he might with impnnity shoot down the man he had quarrelled with.
INAUGURA'1ION OF THE PRESIDENT.
WASHINGTON, MAR1c 9.
On the 4th of March the Administration of Mr. Pierce ceased to exist, and Mr. Buchanan, the new President, entered on his term of office. The ceremonies that transfer the Government from the outgoing to the in-coming chief of the State are of the very simplest kind. The Constitution only prescribes that the new President shaU on that day be swom in by the Chief Judge of the Supreme Court, the term of his predecessor and the existence of Congress ending at noon. Up to that hour- the Legislature can pass; and the President can sign bills; but at the stroke of the clock their authority melts from them, like the grandeur of the fairy tale, and the dispensers of millions and the head of fleets and armies sink again to the ashes and pumpkins of common life. The change is one of the greatest among all the vicissitudes of life, albeit not visible to the eye. Mr Pierce, in his plain suit of black, disposing of desinies and fortunes at 10 in the morning, differ in nothing exter
nally from 1fr. -ie at 1 p.m. ibuat athe latter hour he is a private citizen, and his signt would not dra,w a dollii frixt th} Te , uoa his
order move a troop of Dragoons. His power has departed to another ; and it i the quiet, eay tranisfer of all the functions of the ruler from hand to hand that gives its interest to the inauguration. It is the completion of the process commenced at the nomination of candidates in the summer of last year, and decided, as to the person who is to succeed to the dignity, by the election in November. Nothing of the fierce struggle remains on the day the new President enters on his duties but its memory. The strife may revive afterwards, but is for a time suspended. The election is almost lke the choice of a chief on the field of battle; the formal induction into office is made in the midst of a general truce.
The tendency to invest the simple ceremony of taking the official oath with something of external splendour has been increasing from year to year, and now it has assumed the dimensions of a spectacle in which the military element decidedly predominates, forming a briliant and " unconstitational" exhibition; the law does not recognize the display, but it has grown up by custom, and a 4th of March at Washington without the procession would seem very flat. Even the inaugural address is a voluntary addition to the proceedings not required by law. The precedent has been established that the chief magistrate should on the day he takes office indicate the principles by which he intends to be guided, and the custom could not nowbe evaded. The public has equaUy resolved that the day shal
be distinguisbed by something more than the quiet formality of the Senate-house, and thousands pour into Washington from all parts of the Union who would be much disappointed if the day was not marked by some visible demonstration.
The inauguration of Mr. Buchanan was singularly favoured by the elements. The 4th of March was a beautiful day, though before it the weather had for some time been detestable,and relapsed into the same state immediately afterwards. During four or five hours there was a glimpse of spring,-a bright sun and soft airs. The next day came a piercmg winter's wind and clouds of dust. The city was crowded with guests and visitors; on the 2d and 3d, when the,special trains from Baltimore and Philadelphia began to pour in thousands in addition, the crowd became a crush, and the late comers found great difficulty in finding shelter; but by close packing, 10 and 14 in a room, and the seizure of bars and billiard-tables, the influx was shaken down somewhere. The short-distance trains did their work very well, but pilgrims from New York and more distant points went through all sorts of disasters; a violent storm stopped the ferry across the Susquehanna; the different lines did not " connect," and there was a great accumulation of wayfarers at various points, to the profit of the local hotel-keepers. Those who left New York at one particularly unfortunate juncture were four days on the road to Washington, though the distance ought to be accomplished in 12 hours. Much baggage wvent astray, and many ladies who came to attend the Inauguration Ball fully provided with dresses by the best Niew York ai-istes heard at the last moment that the satms had "gone south" in the confusion. These mishaps were, luckily, the worst. There was much vexatious delay with the railroad trains, but, though the traffic was so immensely increased on the first three days of the month, no serious accident is reported on any of the lines.
The portion of the proceedings of tie day that comes under the head of "spectacle" scarcely repaid the thousands who flocked into the city, if they merely came to see a show. The point of simplicity has been passed, but grandeur is not yet attained. As a sight it was not equal in effect to a general parade of the New York fire companies. The military part of the procession is nearly al voluntary, and consists of companies and detachments of the countless Guards, Fencibles, Rifles, Highlanders, and Jagers, in all kinds of uniforms in which the citizens of the Union delight to enroll themselves. They came in in delegations from 40 to 80 strong from every State of the Federation; some of the companies were in excellent order,-theiruniforms clean and bright, and their drill good; the pecuniary condition of the citizen very much affects the outward appearance of the soldier. These brilliant companies were evidently well to do and could afford to expend something for the credit of the corps. But there were other detachments so oddly threadbare and dilapidated, that if their patriotism had not exceeded their vanity they would surely have remained at home. The most striking of aU the military companies was one in the uniform of the " Continentals" of 1776-blue with buff facings. The colours still linger as a party badge in the cover of the Bdinlntrgh Review-the three-cornered hat and topboots. It is very nearly the dress military artists give Napoleon in his early campaigns. Compared with more modern military tailoring it loses very little. The hat would certainly cateh rain like a dish, but would pour t off clear of the collar; the shako conducts it down the neck. The boots look better than any form of the trouser. On the whole, as a fighting and marching dress, it was quite as good as most of our present uniforms. The officers add an elaborate lace shirt frill, which throws in a touch of the drawingroom ; the "'76th's" were quite a feature of the day. Another relic of the past turned up among the crowd; an old gentleman wore a real quee, a veritable pigtail, carefilly trimmed and tied; in the New World one ancient fashion still survives.
The procession was formed in front of the cityhail; the President and President elect joined it at Wilard's Hotel; they rode in the same carriage to the Capitol, making the centre point of the cavalcade. In front of their carriage was a decorated car with a pole of liberty, and immediately behind it the model of a ship rather overmanned with an oversized crew. The rest of the procession consisted of the different Democratic clubs and associations from the chief cities of the Union, the Washington firemen, and one fire eompany and its engine from New York.
Within the Capitol, on the arrival of the President, a smaler procession was formed in the Senate Chamber, including the Judges of the Supreme Court, the foreign diplomatists, officers of the army and navy and heads of departments. It crossed the Rotunda to the great eastern portico, in front of which a platform, with a few seats, had been constructed. Mr. Buchanan, preceded by the United States' Marshals of the district, descended the steps, the other authorities, and those who hadcformed the procession, oceupying the marble ascent behind him. The lofty columns of the porch made a very good framework of the picture the whole group presented. In front an immense crowd had gathered in the grounds of the Capitol; a sort of flooring had been constructed about four feet from the earth for their accommodation. Looking across this mass of people, Mr. Buchanan exactly faced the statue of Washington at the end of the long walk. In a few minutes after he had taken his place Mr. Buchanan advanced to the front of the platform and read the address, which you have, no doubt, already published.
The oath of office was then administered to Mr. Buchanan by the Chief Judge of the Supreme Court, and the ceremony of the day terminated.

The lat despatches received by M. de Hatzfeldt, and which reached him on Friday night, are not so precse as was expected. They are sufficient to justify a meeting of the Conference, but they are not the definitive instructions people looked for. The conditions demanded by Prussia, as given in the Indapendance Belge, are pretty much the same tbat have been mentioned repeatedly, but, whether they be the same comprised in the last despatches or not, they are very different from the instructions received by Dr. Kern. These are nothing more nor less than the pure and simple renunciation of the sovereignty of the King of Prussia in the Principality of Neuchatel. The Swis3 are not at this moment disposed to accept less. They can hardly be blamed. Dr. Kern set out on his mission declaring that in three weeks from that date he would settle the question, and that the King of Prussia had pledged himself to a complete renunciation. The instructions of Dr. Kern were consequently drawn up in that sense. A pecuniary indemnity, if required by Prussia, would have been conceded in the beginning; now the Swiss will not hear of it. The French Government is, I believe, heartily sick of the whole af&ir, and it is equally irritated with Prussia and with Switzerlaud. The Conference is expected to meet to-morrow, though, as matters seem at present, it is hard to say whether much, if any, progress wil be made in the negotiations. The matter will, I dare say, be settled at last, but with trouble far out of proportion to its importance.
:it may not be forgotten that, when the article of the Moniter on the union of the Danubian Principalities was known at Bucharest, the greatest joy was expressed and the most flattering compliments paid to the French political agent. The French Government has not, however, been over-pleased at these manifestations, which, in point of fact, were a censure on the English Government, which was known to be opposed to the union. Baron de Talleyrand, the French Commissioner to the Principalities, has received instructions from his Government to keep himself on the reserve, and not only not to encourage any such demonstrations, but rather to do all in his power to check them.
Father Ventura continues his denunciations of courtly vices in terms still more energetic than before. In his sermon of yesterday in the Chapel of the Tuileries, and in the presence of the Emperor and the courtiers, his language was of the most unmistakeable kind, and he spoke almost as if he had received the confessions of his auditory, andwa3 authorized to declare them from the pulpit. He addressed himself directly to the Emperor; he declared that, even if his life was moral and edifying, it was not sufficient if he did not stigmatize and drive from his presence all who might scandalize the public by their vices, their corruption, or their profligacy. He said the Emperor was in error if he. thought his private acts were confined to the walls of his palace; they were not; he, and men like him, lived in a house of glass, and no secrets were safe from the prying eyes and the infidelity of coartiers. He toldhim that he was looked up to as a superior being, with powers for good or for evil superior to all others, and that consequently more was expected from him. He denounced those who might sell the favour or protection of the Court for gold, and who had grown rich in iniquity. In fact, the reverend father's language was sO strong that persons by no means friendly to the Emperor thought he struck too hard in his flagellation of magnificent sinners.
There was not much business transacted last week by the Paris manufacturers. Some purchases of gilt bronzes and what are termed artides de Paris were made by brokers for the provinces, but no general movement has yet taken place, and it is still expected that affairs will become more active by the middle of next month. Shopkeepers dealing in silk and cotton goods have had a tolerably good week, the mildness of the weather havincg induced many ladies to purchase spring dresses. From some of the manufacturing towns accounts are rather favourable, as Elboguf, Roubaix, and Tourcoing. Woollen stuffs are in demnand, and some large orders have been received from Paris, where the stock of those articles is exhausted. Calicoes are not so easily disposed of, the high price of the raw material rendering it impossible for the manufacturers to sell at the prices ofiered by the consumers. There has, however, been a small rise observed in the price of cotton thread. The last accounts from Lyons and St. Etienne are not satisfactory. The present dullness is attributed to various causes. First, the manufacturers fear to purchase raw silk at the present exorbitant prices, and prefer to wait until some idea may be formed of the quality and quantity of the next crop. Complaints are likewise made of the non-arrival of orders from the United States. The New York merchants decline to purchase silk goods at the present high price. There is likewise a large quantity of British silks in that city, which can be sold at lower prices than the French, and with which the Lyons manufacturerscannot compete. The price now asked for French silks is from 30 to 40 per cent. higher than that of last year. There is a progressive rise to be noticed in the price of colonial produce. The consumption of sugar, coffee, and cocoa has increased considerably i Frce within later years, and the production of those articles has not increased in the same proportion. The United States, moreover, consume at present a great portion of what was formerly exported. The corn, and particularly the flour, markets are excessively dull. It is difficult to make sales of flour, and at the same time farmers and holders of wheat are endeavouring to maintain the price of that article. The consequence is that the millers, finding their profits every day reduced, diminish their production. Nobody doubts that a speedy fall in the price of wheat is inevitable. The accounts from the agricultural districts were never more favourable as to the appearance of the growing crops. The young wheat is but little advanced, and wil not have to fear the spring frosts. There is no doubt but an abundant harvest will have an enormous effect on trade in general by circulating a large amount of capital. lour of the very best quality was offered at the last market at 76f. oOc. and 75f. the sack of 157 kilogrammes. Bakers supplied themselves with flour for their own purposes at 74f. the sack. The reserve of flour in the Paris market stores amounts to 15,000 metrical quintals, and all the other stores are well stocked.
The accounts received from the departments are not calculated to encourage the holders of large quantities of wheat. There is no longer any demand from the southern provinces, and the corn market has falen at Marseiles, Bayonne, and Bordeaux. The demand for wheat from Spain and Portugal has likewise ceased. Excellent news has been received from Algiers, announcing thatlonefifth more land has been sown with wheat tthis year than last, and that the growing crops promise an abundant harvest. Wines of all qualities continue to be sold at high prices at Bercy, in consequence of the continued demand from Paris and the suburbs. Old wines of the vintage of 1846 and 1848 are quoted at Auxerre at 300f. the cask of 272 litres; Chablis at 180f. Spirits distiled from beetroot have falen In Paris to 123f. the hectolitre.
A letter from Smyrna, in mentioning the arrival in that port of the French squadron, states that Admiral Bouet-Willaumez immediately took up his residence on shore, and intended with his family to pass the Holy Week at Jerusalem. The same letter
aIso gives a few details concerning the loss of tbe RE.ocoe, already known by telegraph. An Austrian steamer having arrived with intelligence that a vessel laden wit-h coal as on fire near Ghediz, the Admiral despatched the Brandon steamer to her assistance. She proved to be the English brig Roscoe, which was on shore, and burning furiously, in consequence of the inflammable nature of the cargo, and the wind blowing fresh at the time. The crew, 19 in number, had got into three boats, and ewe able to save some of their property. Just after the arrival of the steamer the brig, having burned to the water's edge, filled and went down. The crew were afterwards taken on board the Brandon and conveyed to Smyrna.

AUSTRIA.
(FROM OUN Oww COrwsRPONDzr.)
V.IENNA, MROH 21.
Shortly after my yesterday's letter was posted official eonfirmation was acquired of the information which it contained relative to the state of the Austro-Sardinian controversy. Yesterday, at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, the Marquis de Cantono went to the Foreign-office, and was officially informed that Count Paar had, on Monday, the 16th, been recalled from his post. According to 'my informant, the unpleasant intelligence was commuiiicated " in a diplomatie way." M. de Cantono was told that Count Paar had been summoned to Vienna, in order that he might by word of mouth make known to his Government the opinions and views of Count Cavour. The Sardinian diplomatist was also given to understand that the Austrian Govermnent would not object to his remaining at his post if he felt inclined to do so. The intentions of the Turin Cabinet in respect to M. de Cantono are not yet known here, but it is foreseen that he wiU receive orders to leave Vienna without delay. In a former letter it was said that the Imperial Government entertained no idea of taldng any positively hostile measures against Sardinia.
Some information of interest has been forwarded to me from Bueharest. According to my correspondent, the agitation in favour of the union is being carried on "with equal tact and energy." Allk inds of fine promises are made to the peasants. If the union takes place, their pockets will be full of piastres, they will do no more work than they please, and the use of the stieck as an instruiment of punishment will be abolished for ever. The great difficultywhich the French and Russian agents have to contend with is, that the Moldavian and WaUlachian tillers of the soil are as little able to comprehend what is meant by the "union," as the Russians were to understand what the " constitution" was of which the conspirators spoke after the death of Alexander I. of Russia. Another impediment to the union propagandism is, that not half-a-dozen peasants out of every hundred can read, but an expedient has been found which wiU diminish the evil. A staff of readers has been formed, whose duty it will be to communicate to the people the contents of newspapers, pamphlets, &c. The necessary preparations are being made for publishing unionist papers at Bucharest and Jassy. Should the Divan ad hoc pronounce in favour of the union, and the Porte refuse to accede to their wishes, the object of Russia will be fully attained, for the Roumans wi'l again consider her their champion and the defender of their rights and privileges. The face is, that Russia has played her cards so well that she is sure to have the sympathy of the inhabitants of Moldavia and Wallachia. Lf the two provinces are united, the people will see in the union the hand of Russia; if they remain in stafltG quo, the odium will fall on Turkey, Austria, and England.
The impression that the world is to be at an end on the 13th of June is so prevalent in Gallicia that the peasants are becoming somewhat difficult to manage. The poor ignorant creatures have been confirmed in the idea that they have but a few weeks to live by the abolition of the "passport torture" in Austria and thd reduction of the passport tax in Russia. According to a Polish correspondent of the 0st-Deutsche Post, the lower classes express themselves as follows:-" No one now troubles himself about the world and its inhabitants. A man can go where he pleases, as it is now all the same whether he is here or in America." A proposal has just been made to the directors of the various Austrian railroad companies which deserves particular mention. It continually happens that drowsy travellers do not hear the voice of the guard when he announees the name of the station, and are carried on beyond their destination. To obviate this for the future, it is proposed to affix to the inside of each carriage a small apparatus, by means of which a bell can be put in motion, and the name of the next station shown to the travellers before the train stops.
The great "inexpressible or non-inexpressible" controversy has been decided in favour of the public. Since the return of their Majesties from Lombardythe "ugly things" which the Jesuitseaused to be put on the nether extremities of the danse-uses have been abolished.
The Public Health.
THE PUBLIC HEALTH.
(From the RegistrrGeneral's Weekly Return.)
Tho total number of deaths registered in London, which in the previous week was 1,156, was, in the week that ended last Saturday, 1,195, of which 627 were deaths of males, and 568 those of females. In the ten years 1847-56 the averag3 number of deaths in the weeks corresponding with last week v;as 1,198, which almoet entirely agrees with the number now returned; but, as last week's deaths occurred in an iLcreased population, the average must be raised for the purpose of comparisonproportionauytotheincrae,in which case It wil become 1,318. Hence it appears that 123 persons survived last week, whose names would have been inscribed on the registers if the average rate of mortality had prevailed.
As has been shown in recent returns, the disemses classed under the general term " zymotic," and the most Important of which, with the exception of typhus, are fatal principally to children, exhibit in the aggregate a considerably reduced rate of mortaUty. The deaths referred to this class are in the present return 197; the corrected average of corresponding weeks is 254. The decrease appears under smallpox and typhus (or common fever; the former was fatal in four cases, the average being 15; the latterin 24 cases, the average being 51. Scarlatina, whichcarried off27 children,and whooping-cough, which carried off 58, both make a close approximation to their averages. Twenty-six children died of measles, a number which vary slightly exceeds the average. Seventeen persons died of diarrhoea. On reference to the Table of Epidemics it will be seen that the deaths from the six diseases which have just been specified occurred in proportions not very dissimilar throughout the different parts of the metropolis; but that the four sub-districts which compose East and West London contributed only 4 out of the 157, and the city none, which is in part to be explainod by the fact tha', this portion of the metropolis is in a less degree than others occupied by the younger members of famiiUes. The deaths from bronchitis rose last week to 164.
Eight nonagenarians died in the week; the oldest wero a nurse who died in Walworth at the age of 94 years, a gentleman who died at the same age in Upper Charlottestreet, Totteuham-court-road, and a widow in the German Jews' Hospital at Mie-end, who had reached the age of 99 years.
A man died in the sub-district of Finsbury, St. Luke, from privation; a horse-hair-drawer from glanders; a person from intemperance, 4 persons from carbuncle.
Last week the births of 939 boys and 916 girls, in all 1,855 children, were registered in London. In the ten corresponding weeks of the years 1847-56 the average number was 1,603.
At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean height of the barometer in the week was 29719 in. The highest reading in the week was 29-90 in. on Saturday. The mean temperature of the week was 45-1 deg., which is 3-3 deg. above the average of the same week in 43 years (as determined by Mr. Glaisher). The mean daily tamperature was above the average till Saturday, when it was 62 deg. below it. The air was warmest on Wednesday, on which day the highest temperature of the week ocurred, and was 66-2 deg., and the mean temperature was 52 dog., which is 114 deg. above the average. The lowvesttemperature of the week occurred ou Tuesdav and Saturday (the latter a bitterly cold day), nd was 33 0 deg.; and the entire range of temperature in the week was therefore 33-2 deg. The mean dewpoint temperature was 39 7 deg., andthe difference between this and the mean temperature of the air was 5 4 deg. The wind blew first from the south-west, after-wards from the south-east, then from the est, and on Eaturday afternoon changed to northeast. 1ein fell to the amount of 0 -33 in., nearly all of which was melted hail that fell on Sunday (the 15th); on which day the horizontal morement of the air was 310 rses, OnThursday the motion of the uir was only fLie

T.he Royal Mail Compsay's steamship Tamar, Captain J. H. Jellioon, arr.ived hero this morning with the Brazilian and River Plate mails, in charge of i^eutenant Irwin, R.N., Admiralty agent. Her date wrere:

. -- A amtr lwas ueiaect bor coals at St. Vincent, strong gales! prevailing; she experienced strong north-easterly gales from the line. This steamer brings 35 passengers, and landed 34 at Lisbon. On freight she has specie from Buenos Ayres value 3,8001.; from Rio, 1,0851.; total, 4,8851. sterling; diamonds value 25,801. ; and the cargo includes 100 barrels of tapioca, 14 serons of ipecacuanha, 25 bags of cocoa, 384 bags and 4 pipes of cochineal, and .13 packages of sundries.
From Buenos Ayres our advices state that the law respecting the differential duties had been modified by the authorities of the upper provinces now allowing vessels to discharge part of their cargo at Buenos Ayres and at Montevideo, and then proceed up the river with the remainder; also considering Bahia, Blanca, and Castilo as foreign ports, owing to which the effect of the measure on the comnimerce of Buenos Ayres will be much less serious than was anticipated. The Buenos Ayrean Government addressed a note to Her Britannic Majesty's Acting Consul-General, apologizing for their note of the 6th of January, 1853, to tho Hon. Captain Gore, enclosing him his passport, and requesting that both the note and the passport might be considered as withdrawn. In consequence of this apology being accepted, the British flag was duly saluted at 1 p.m. on the lat of February, which salute was returned by Her Majesty's ship Harier. The money-market had been very tight. Exchange opened at 72s. cash on London, and subsequently declined to 71s., at which it was maintained until the day of sailing of the Tamar, when some large amounts were done at 69s. and a short credit. Doubloons had gradually advanced from 331 to 341i during the month. In freights for England and the continent large transactions had taken place, but for other quarters a limited business had been done. To England.--Salted hides, 45s. to 47s. Gd.; tallow, pipes, 50s. to 55s.; boxes, 50s.; tobacco, 40s. to 45s.; bales, 40s. to 45s.
Our Buenos Ayrean correspondent writes as follows on the 31st of January -.-
" We are reduced in politics to the lowest ebb. Ministers and admirals pass and repass to and from the Parana, without deigning to take the least notice of us or spealing a civil word.
"Admiral Johnston was here for a few days. No public-that is, official notice was taken of his arrival, and we are not aware that he had any
interview, public or private, with any member ofI the Government-a great change from the palmny days when Mr. Southern was the confidential counsellor of Don Juan Manuel Rosas!
" Our internal parties are at daggers drawn with each other; but there is a general determination to allow Dr. Obligado to finish his legal term, and, fortunately, the revolutionary maniar is fast falling into disrepute.
" Our commercial affairs are quite paralyzedinview of the differential duties, aggravated by an immense overstock of goods that persons hardly k;now what to do wiith. Our situation is far from satisfactory as regards commercial interests and prospects.
"iln other respects the country is prosperous, and ought to be happy.,,
F>rom the .Brazils we learn that it was believed a new Ministry would be formed before the openinog of the Chambers in May next. In the meantime thiere was nothing stirrlng in politics. Yellow fever prevailed at all the ports, and at Bahia and Bio, principally among the shipping, of a very malignant type. The Tarnar lost two men by this epidemic.
A letter from Rio. dated the 24th nit., says:
* Peace reigns all over the empire.
"The works of the first section of theDDomPedro I. Raileayare carried on with rapidity, and it is heped that lt will he openod to public traffic eitner in August or September. The second section is already marked out, and it cro-ssc the great serra which separates theParaibaValleyfrom the ocean cmrrents. The plans will be ready in Febrary. The Cordilleraoffers a mdxiesumadelivityof y5 in12 miles distance-i. e., Bnglish miles, termnting in a tunnel of 1,950 feet; in the ronmainingpart of it the declivitiesyare not superior to 1.80.

the directors, on their part without any compromius for the first contract, give full liberty to all who may offer more Edvantages m such an undertaking.
'Since the saiing of the French packet Bynetn to Marselles, by which wve have duly remitted the commercial information which onght to have been taken by this conveyance on the 15th inst, our markets have not presented much interest. Transactions have been made in exchange upon London for this mail (TamnAr) at 2 to 27p 90tdays' sight; Paris, 34S 90 days' sight; and Elamburg, 657 90 days' sight.

The latest Bahia Prcio CUha ent (Feb. 28) states that, owingdprincipalUy to the heavy importations during the lsst month or two, the CustomEHouse and landed warehouses were completely filled; vessels had been obliged to wait for weeks before they were admitted to discharge their cargoes, and grieat stagnation had taken place in the import-market. The stocks of beef on hand amounted to about 40,000 arrobas, selling at 4,500 reis to 6,000rein per srroba, according to quality. In butter no sales had been effected during the previous week, and quotations were nominaUy 660 reis to 640 rein for Irish; and 5i70 reis to 560 reix per lb. French. No sales had transpired in flour, and stocks in hand amounted to about 17,000 barrels. The export-market was brisker. We quote the following from the Prion Current of the above date:-
"Sugar.-Considerable activity has prevailed during the past wneek, and brown sugars were oagerly purchased at 3,200 reis per arroba in cases, with slight abatement on ingenor descpntions; for h upeor bags somlcething more has been goanted; whites are less inquired after, and sell slotly at 4,100 reis and 4,000 reis per arroba, according to qulity.

ThePeninsular and OrienitalCompany's gteasmerAlhambra, Captain W. J. Woodgates, arrived here this morning, with the mails of tho following dates, in chuge of Lieutenant Beddek, R.N. :-Gibraltar, March 14; Cadiz, 15th; Lisbon, 19th; Vigo, 20th. She had no communication with Oporto. On the outward voyago the Alhambra experienced strong gales from the N.W. and N.; and on the return voyapge fine weather as far as Vigo, and across the Bay a heavy north gale, with very high sea.

At Gibraltar Her Majesty's ship Curlew.
From Valencia, under date of the 5th inst., more disasters are reported in consequence of the tempestuous state of the weather on that coast. Two vessels, one Spanish and the other Sardinian, had been totlUy wrecked and cargo lost; crows happily saved.

The Recent Loss Of Life By Fire In Newing-
THz rECENT Loss OF LIFE BY FIE iN NEWINGTOz;.-Yesterday the adjourned inquest upon the bodies of EmUy Rayner and her four children was held at the Hourglass, Walworth-common. Theproceedings derived some additional interest from the existence of a very strong feeling on the part of the inhabitants of the neighbourhood tbat some at least of the live8 might have been saved had not the police prevented persons from rendering assistance: aDd almost the whole of the examination, which lasted all day, was directed to that point. Mr. Superintendent Lund watched the case on the part of the P division, and Mr. Baddeley, an inspector of the Royal Society for the Preservation of Life from Fire, was precent. The house still remains in the same condition as during the last inquiry, and has been visited by large numbers of people. The rooms present a very singular appearance; in some mstances the floors, although burnt through, remain standing with all the furniture in the most perfect order, but completely consumed, the whole crumblng to ashes under the touch. Dovwnstairs the supper had been laid, and still remains, but all the provisions on the table are burnt, and the various jugs and drinkinsg vessels fused and broken by- the intense heat The upper rooms are totally consumed, with the single exception of the place where the unfortunate woman's body lay. At the inquest yesterday Mr. Baddoley complained that altbough a fire-escape had been kept for some years at the
;lepbant and Castle, the officers there had never received a call from polieemen in case of fire, the information being always brought by other persons He considered that a great deal of mischief was done by the practice of fire insurance companies making an allowance of a sovereign in some cases to policemen for keeping the door of burning premises. Mr. Lund said that st could be proved that the police officers did call at the fire-escxpe office, and mentioned the fact that they got half-a-crown for doing so, whereas they only received Is. for calling at the fireengine offices. After hearing the whole of the evidenoe, the jury returned a verdict that Mrs. Rayner and her four children were accidentally burnt to death, adding to it the following expression of opinion -
"W te jury. are of opinion tbatIt is desrbleinaUcIImot fire wbere lives are endangered that the polloe sbould not prevent the entrance of any person or persons who mnsy volunteer their aid to reau the Inmates of such houes on re,; and wO turtber srongly recommend that the poliee, on their way for the ftrengines, should.
under no circumstane,', lose time in obtaining a fire-ewaps, whether peisons be knw to be on the prnmi on fire or rnot "
The Coroner, having read over the verdict to Ir. Superintendent Lund, stated that it did not appear to the jury that in this case there was any reflection upon the conduct of the police; but they recommended tbe precautions in question as a means of preventing further loss of life. The meaning of the latter clause was that in case the fire-eacape was kept in one direction and the engine in another, both should be sent for immediately. Mr. Lund stated that the
recommendation should receive attention, and expressed ` hope that the strong feeling entertained in the neighbourhood would no longer contsnue to exist, Tho toremau of the Jury said, "It is our oinion that in this case no blame attaches to the police." The proceedings then terminated.

Fire Near Temple-Bar.
FIJ .REAR TEMPLE-BAR.
The fire which broke out on Mondy night in the premises )elonging to Mr. Watkinson, upholsterer, No. 227, Strand, 'hotar Temple-bar, briefly noticed in this journal of yesterday, was not wholly extinguished until nearly 4 o'clock, when it was found that far greater mischief was done than was expected when our report was written.
The premises of Mr. W~atkinsr being surrounded by numerous ancient and lofty building, it seems a perfect miracle that every structure near was [not levelled with the ground, more especially as at one time seven or eight houses were on fire, and the space between Palsgraveplace and Thanet-place is so narrow that every house in the two named court* as well as many in the Strand,became covered with sparks, and the roofs with Large pieces of burnig material projected from the blazing premises.
The amge done is very considerable, and was thus officially reported to the various insurance companies yesterday morning *

THE NEW RUSSIAN FRONTIER.-(From a private
Thn, NEW Russi.Ns FRoN'raIE.-(From a private letter.)-So many incorrect versions have appeared in several European journals about the proceedings and intentions of the European Commission ot the Danube that there is considerable danger of false views being taken by the publio on this important subject. I take, therefore, this oppor` tunity to give you a concise account of the present positon of thr. Danubian Commission, on the correctness of which you may rely. The Commission met the first week in November last at Galatz, since which time they have been employed in the examination of the different months of the river, in the formation of a working staff, and in the consideration of questions relating to the state of the naviption of the lower Danube. In their examination of the mouths, which from the lateness of the season could be but cursory, they were much assisted by the valuable sur. ve7s of Captain Spratt, RL N., and by the lucid reports of 41si. officer. These are the only authentic and accurate surveys to which the Commission has had access. The projectof an Austrian ongmeer was submitted to the Commissioners individually, but without the surveys on which it is based. The works therein projected involve au enormous expenditure, and it isnot probable that they will beadopted. The Commission will not pronounce Ainally until its own engineers have made their surveys and recommendations. It is thought that the St. George's mouth of theDAnube proper will ultimately be fixedupon as that beFt calculated to afford most accommodation to commerce, and to repay the expense of works that must be constrtcted whichever embouchure is selected. In the early spring attempts will be made to afford a temporary nmprovement to the Sulina branch and mouth, for the facUiltating of its navigation, until the more extensive works contemplated are finished.
The City Of London.
THE CITY OF LONDON.
TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-It is now two years since that, at a meeting uaprecedented in point of numbers and unanimity in this city, I was called from the retirement of my counting-house to take an active part in the formation of the Administrative Reform Association. Previous to this I had taken little izrterest in any political movement, except periodicaly recording my votes in favour of Liberal candidates.
At the request of Mr. Roebuck I undertook the statistical department of the association, a portion of the duties of which consists in the examination and tabulary record of the votes of the members of the House of Commons.
The result obtained by such examination, as regards the city of London and some of our metropolitan boroughs, reflects little credit on our representatives.
In the last session London was represented by Sir James Duke in 44, by Mr. Masterman in 37, and by Lord John RusseU in 29 of the 198 divisions that took place.
In the report of the speech of Lord John Russell at the London Tavern, on the 17th inst., his Lordship is said to have stated that "the Liberal Registration Association had unfairly excluded him from their list of candidates."
That the resolution of the Liberal Association was pro. posed with any such intention of unfairly excluding his Lordship's name I beg most emphatically to deny, as it was proposed by myself, under the following circumstances:-
On Monday, the 9th inst., I attended a meeting of the Liberal Registration Committee, and ascertained that the registration showed an increase of 2,000 Liberal electors. On that day it was currently reported that Lord John Russell did not intend to stand for the city of London; that there was a strong feeling on the part of a large portion of the Liberal electors that his Parliamentary conduct had of late not been in unison with their sentiments. It was said that, had he been sincere in his wishes to relieve the Jews from their disabilities, he would, as a member of the Cabinet, have long since advocated that important measure with a determination that must have brought it to a successful issue. That it was the intention of Lord John Russell to contest Middlesex there can be little doubt, for which purpose MIr. Byng was selected to represent the family borough of Tavistock.
The names of Lord Palmerston, the Marquis of Blandford, andLord Stanley had been publicly annonnced as noblemen likely to be brought forward for London, and the streets had already been placarded for Lord Palmerston.
Lord John Russell, it will be recolected, was originally elected and elected by the citizens of London as the representative of the great principle of civil and religious liberty How far he has sustained that character of late years remains for the consideration of the electors of London.
If it be the desire of the electors of London to elect Lord John Russell, Lord Palmerston, the Marquis of Blandford, or Lord Stanley as the representative of a principle, the selection of such noblemen is inteligible; but, believing that it is the opinion of the majority of the electors of London that the time has arrived when this city ought to be represented by persons connected with trade, I proposed the resolution, which was unanimously adopted by the committee, and subsequently as unanimously confirmed at the general meeting, which was attended by some of his Lordship's present ardent supporters.
That Lord John RusseU intended to retire from the representation of the city his Lordship will not venture to deny. lt has been currently reported that he was induced to alter that intention at the urgent request of a noble relative, who prefers to divide the Liberal interest, which has hitherto been so faithful to him and his family.
The present candidates are all gentlemen connected with commerce.
Baron Rothschild, in addition to this claim, represents the great principle of religious and civil liberty, for which the electors of London have so long contended.
Mr. Crawford is no less eminent as a merchant than a Reformer, and has received a large amount of support on a former occasion.
Mr. Raikes Currie, an eminent banker, has been an unflinching Reformer during his long career in Parliament, and last session he carried an important measure against united aristocratic influence in the House of Commons.
Sir James Duke has always been Liberal ; he may be said to represent the Corporation of the city of BLndon, whose interests, it is only just to say, ought to be represented in Parliamnent when the question of Corporation Reform is to considered.
As a member of the Administrative Reform Association I have devoted much tine and some money to what I believe to be a public duty, and I am not to be deterred by the fear of being called a mere Palmerstozian from urging on the Liberal electors of London to return commercial men as their representatives, and relieve the city of London from becoming an appendate to one or the other of the aristocratic sections which have hitherto governed the destinies of this great commercial country, and often sacrificed its best interests to their adherence to power.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

Mr. Cobden And The Late Lord Dudley Stuart.
MIRL COBDBN A2ID THE LATE LORD DUDrLEY
STUART.
TO THE EDITO OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-It was no very judicious reference that Mr. Cobden made in his attack upon Lord Palmerston at Manchester to Lord Dudley Stuart. Few careers contrast more completely than those of Mr. Cobden and the late member for MIarylebone. The political life of the one has been yassed in smoothing the way for the aggrandizement of
ussi&-of the other, in opposing it.
That I do not make this assertion respecting Mr. Cobden lightly I will prove by his own words. In the year 1836 he published his celebrated pamphlet, Russia, by a MancJWesWMsanufacfturer. It is in a great measure an elaborate answer to a speech made by Lord Dudley Stuart in the House of Commons, pointing out the dangers which would threaten thiscountry if Russia were permitted to pursue without opposition her designs on the integrity of the Turkish empire. lt was Mr. C(obden's cue then to describe Russia as a despicable adversary:-
Themanufcturing didens aone-viz., the i on vnties of Eag laned coeprising Lancl re, Yorkshire, Chehe and u affosedhirecould at any moment, by means of the sland Industry of their PoDulatoen, froma the naturrl resources of this comparative speck of territory, combat with success the whaole Russiaan erpirel Ldverpool and Hull with their nav*es d Mancbester, Leeds, and BirminghaLm with their capitals, oould blockade within the waters of Cronstadt the entire Runsuan marine, and aunihlato the commerce of St. Petersburg. And, firther, it we imppose that during the next 0 years Rusdea, adhering to her sstem of territorial aggrandisemenk, were to swallow up sucoessively her neighbours Perae and Turkey while Engaind, whrchwe haves iagined to comprire onxly the area or Yeur counties still tersevered inther proe sent cwreer of mechanical ingenuity, the relative forces would at the end of that time be yjet more greatly in favour of the neaetflanld industrious empire. hids mere speck on the Oeh an, without colonies, which are but the costly appendage of an anetocratic Government, without wars, wbich have eyer been but another aristocract node of plundering and oppressing comfmerce, weod with only a few hundred equare leagues of surface, by means of the wealth which by her arts and indust she has accumulated, I be the anrbtres of the destiny of Ruasio , with Its milons of square ngiles of teritory. Liverpool and Hull, with their thousands of vessel, would be in a rndition to die. tate laws to the Poeses4or of one-fourth pact of the surface of the g8obe;they.would then be enabled to blockade Russia in the Sea of Marmoers, as they ceuld now do in the Gulf of Pluand, to deny her the freedom of the seas, to deprive her proud nobles of every foreign commodity and luxury, and eegrade them amid their thouands of serfs tothe barbarousstatef o their anOneStrof theanrentousnthe and to confne her Czar in his splendid prison of Costantlinople,y Russia; by a Manchester idanufwturer, p. it."
This was Air. Cobden's languag in 1836, when it ap. peared desirable that Russia should be supposed weak, in order that publio attention might be diverted froma her aggressions on Turkey and the Circasiam. Now hoar what he says in 1856, a month or two before the termitiation of the war, when it was becoming apparent, greatly to the alarm of her friends, that the strength of Russia was rapidly declining:-
Forf j years before the appearane of the boeule cruiss on her coast Russia had been so industriously occupied in blockading her own
port by m eroprohibitIve tarti! as t have leftless for her enembes to
In this respect tfh somdeno them ma n h supposed.-' Wbat
Nofthin now about the power of the manufacturing districtst al a uoneto coerce R ias A cnd MrCobden proceeds
pItraunotbe denoedthattheibloc;ade ofthecrat of Rus.a loses its power of coercion In proportion as the has punsued a coure of economnical isolation. You caunot ruin ports which a false poiry has neotallowed to exist, or impoverish merchantsa where none had been permatted to flourish, or, by intercepting tageso fustian, condemn tonkdesapopulation contenit wish horpeeDkins, or cut off the saecharlae leixurles of a people who prefer their own InsiDid beetroot sngar to the more luscous product of the cane of the tropics, or by closing the navigation of the Nova deny the dleasue of the tea-table to the inh.bitsnts of St. Petersburg, who have volunitarily chosen to bring the whole of their favourite beverage 4,000 miles overland from China, or exPose them to the rigours of winte by interdictiag them from receiving at Cronstod the furs which are conveyed to thema atetr a journey of a..twelvemont.h, from their own territory inSmberia and North Amaerica,
And having succeeded in showing that protection has rendered Russia indifferent to blockades, Mri. Cobden next expatiateS (with the game view) on the admirable system of internal communication existing in Russia, which miade her quite insensible to the barbarous andawanton destruc. tion of her stores by the English flest under Sir Edmund Lyon& Mn Cobden then points out the inicreased dangers which war brings upon English commierce, in conseuec
of the repeal of the usury laws I CouldL Nedthrtained and brazen adv tot of Russia, hv etrdn a as the English Philo-Russian volunteeontecduiyf Englishmen ?
lbnt the views of Mr. Cobden and Lord Dudley Stuart were less opposed with regard to the possibility- ancl propriety of resisting the aggressions of Russia than upo;n the
subject of her conduct towards Poland. Lord audey
Stuarts opinions oni the Polish question are so well known as to render quotation superfluous; but it may prhaps have escaped the operatives of Huddersfield (who lik true Enlishmnen are, I have no doubt, on the side of the oppressed
that Mr. Cobden alone among the public men of EnY.gland,
whether Conservative, Liberal or Radical, has not blushed, in his zeal for the lorification. of Russia, to rejoice in the partition of Polan -,
"1The fate of Poland,' says Mr. Cobden at p. 15 of his Russia, by a Masic1eestA.anufacturer-, "was but a triump)h of justice, without which its history would have conveyed nomrlfrthe benefit of posterity."
In the eyes of Air. Cobden the partition of Polandas an act of justice; Sir john, Dowring bas reason to be thankful that the attack upon Canton has been condemned by the same tribunal.
Lot us trust that the Huddersfieldl election will likewise prove a triumh of justice; the biography7 of Mfr. Cobden wil then not hetale of reckless inconsisteny coniveying no maoral for the benfit of fut.ursttesmen,-
I have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servant.

(Before Vice-Chancdlor Sir R. T. Xnzsxa zy.)
Mr. WALac appeared in support of a petition in this suit, asking for payment out of court df a sum of 1,8001., under these circumstances:-It appeared that Wiliam Cundy, who died in 1783, by his will gave a sum of 200. to his sister, Mtrs. Morton, for life, with remainder to her sons, Wiliani Morton and John Morton, absolutely; but in case of theu- deaths in their mother's lifetime there was a gift over of the legacy in favour of her other children. Mm Morton died three years after the testator, and the circumstances attending the career of the two Eons were these :-Iu 1772 John left England for India, and William was apprenticed to a weaver, but eventually ran away from his employmnent and went to Newl York on board the ship Terrier, wvhich, however, he there deserted, and neither he nor his brother were ever afterwards heard of. Upon this state of facts it was submitted that the deaths of the two sons must be assumed to have taken plAce in the lifetime of the mother, and that hence the other children were entitled to the legacy, which, with accumulated interest, was now represented by the fund of ,8001. in court and now asked to be paid out.

This was a petition presented by the presentLord Port. arlington, praying in effect that certain securities, dated the 17th ot Julyv, 1845, and the 20th of February, 1846, and a judgment might be put in smit against the real and personal representatives of the late Mr. John Sadleir and his sureties, Thomas Joseph Eyre, James Sadleir, Vincent Scully, Sylvester Young, and Clement WiUliam Sadleir, and for other purposes. It appeared that the estates in question in the petition had been mortgaged by the late Lord Portarlington to secure two suns of 56,0001. and 344,0001. The late Mr. John Sadleir, by an order of the Court, had been appointed receiver of the estates, and the two debts of 5b,0001. and 344,000L had, as it appeared, been reduced by a considerable amount by payments made by orders of the Court from time to time. It Was now proposed, in consequence of Mr. John Sadleir's deatb, under circumstances which are matter of public notoriety, leaving, as it was stated, a sum of at least 15,0001. due on account of his receivership, that the recogpizances which his above-named sureties bad entered into in respect of the receivership should be put in suit. The estates when sold, it was not anticipated, would realize more than sufficient to discharge the encumbrances thereon. It was urged on behalf of the sureties' representative, Mr. Eyre, who was virtually liable in the penalty of the recognizances, that the sureties having done all in their power to faciitate the taing of the accounts this application was now made to put these recognizances in force against him. The petitioner had, moreover, concurred in not having the money brought into court, as he ought to have done when John Sadeir was quite solvent.
Mr. Swanston, Air. Glasse, Mr. Baily, Mr. C. Barber, Mr. Osborne, Mr. Cracknall, Mr. H. R. Young, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Riddell, and Mr. J. Bateman appeared for the petitioner and parties in the same interest; Mr. Beales ap peared for the representative of the surety.
The VIo-CHA.NCELLOR thought that the real question was what amount ought to be brought into court. The due keeping and passing of the accounts was the very thing for which the sureties were liable, but if their application was granted the effect would be that a verdict for 60,0001. would go against Mr. Eyre, which would be monstrous injustice, when it was not really ascertained what the balance against the receiver was. A sum of 4,3711. was found due, and upon payment of that sum into court, and 3fr. Eyre undertaking to pay in such further sumns as the Court should direct from time to time, undertaking also to submit to such order as the Court should make as to the costs of taking the account, and paying the costs of this application, the recognizanoes must not be enforced at present.

THE lN-DIlE-COT.T.TTAN
(Before Dr. LUSHThGTON.)
This was a suit promoted by the brig Auspicious of the burden of 245 tons against the screw, steam yacht Undine, of the burden of 105 tons, to recover the loss arising from a collision between them at 3.45 a.m. on the 3d of October last, about 30 miles west of the island of Bornholm, in the Baltic Sea. The brig, coal laden, was bound from Hull to Stockholm, and, as she stated, was close hauled on the port tack. The night was dark, and the brig carried a clear bright light suspended from the collar of her foretop maststay. At the time in question she observed two lights, one on her starboard and the other on her port bow, both distant more than two miles. The master ordered the light to be got down and held un over the weather bow, and the bng to be kept clean fulL The light seen on the starboard bow passed clear a considerable ds tance to leeward, and the light on the port bow which proved to be that of the Undine, was carefully watched until it was at least three points on the weather bow, so that if the two vessels had kept their respective courses no colliswon could have occurred; but the steamer suddenly ported her helm and ran into the port bow of the brig. The steam yacht, the property of the Duke of Sutherland, pleaded that the ught of the brig was seen about three points and a-half on her starboard bow, whereupon the helm was starboarded, in order to give her a wider berth. When at the distance of about 100 yards she was made out to be rapidly approaching the Undine on the starboard bow, and, seeing it was impossible to keep the vessels clear, the helm was put hard astarboard, in order to ease the blow. A cross action was entered by the Undine. The witnesses were examined viva vocc.
Dr. Jenner and Dr. Deane appeared for the brig; Dr. Twiss and Dr. Spinks for the steam yacht.
The learned JUDGE inquired of the Elder Brethre- which of the vessels was to blame, or whether both of them were in fault.
The ELDER BREBEx considered that the blame attached solely to the steamer.
The CouRT pronounced for the brig in both actions.

This insolvent was discbarged in ISS5 fom debts amounting in the aggregate to 19,0001. A rule had been granted, npon the application of Mr. G. S. Ford, an attorney, requiring Messrs. erees and Co., the bankers, to bold ad
retain any roneys in their hands belonging to the insolvent, and also sequiring Mr. Joseph Dawson, a triner, to hold and retain a certain racehorse called Gemma de Vergy, which was saidto be worth 2,0001. To-dAy had been 6sed for showing cause, as the horse waa engaged to run to-mor. row at Northampton.
Mr. Sargood appered to show cause on behalf of tho insolvent, and Mr. Reed appeared for a creditor on the schedule, but! that person not being a party to the rule, the Court refused to hear the counsel; Mr. Nichola supported the rule.
Mr. SABGooD denounced the proceeding as most unfounded and vexatious, and suggested that its object was rather to prevent the horse from running to-morrow than to benefit the creditors. The learned counsel produced an affidavit from Mr. Coglilan, stating that at the time tho rule
waa granted he had onilya balance of 371. at his banker's, and further, that he was DOt the sole owner of Gemma di Vergy. In add&tion, Mr. Coghlan swore that he owed debts to the exteut of 2,000l., equal to the whole assumed value
Mr. Nicreors submitted that the Court could enforce its rule gainst the horse, notwithstanding it was not the sole property of the insolvent. Re also contended that Mr. Davwson and Mr. Coghian should be examined rsd.a rocc.

GUMHAiLL-Wiam Stevens, an old man 74 years of age, whose case appeared in our paper a few days ago, when by mistake he was described as Wiliam Mounsear, the name of the prosecutor, was again brought up on the charge of icking hr Mounsea's pocket.
The prisoner still declined to give his address, and, no owners having been found for the pocket and betting books, Sir P LInrE, alluding to the prisoner's age, said he was afSt object for a reformatory (laughter), and committed him to the HIolloway House of Correction for 21 days.
Bow-STRErT.-James Wright, a Post-office letter-carrier emplozed in the Streatham district, was charged with wilfuly delaying five post letters.
In consequenco of frequent complaints from the prisoners district of the delay or non-delivery of letters, a close watch had been kept on him for some time, but without result until Monday of last week. On that dy Mr. Sculthorpe, the deuty-controller of letter-carriers, received information that John Denyer, footman to Mr. C. Candy, of Wellfield, Streatham, had intrusted the prisoner with a half-sovereign to obtain a Post-office order and enCose it in a letter (which he also handed to the prisoner) addressed to his (Dyerns) wife in Devonshire-stree, Holborn. The prisoner had neglected to obtain the order, and Mr. Sculthorpe, suspecting that he had appropriated the money, and, if so, would not willingly go to the house, caused a test letter to be addressed to Denyer and posted in town. The letter having been traced to the prisoner's possession, but not having been delivered to Denyer, the officer Smee went to the prisoner's house and apprehended him The letter was not found upon him, but on being pre5sed

without any provocation caught her by the hair of the bead, dragged her about, threw her down, kicked her witli his heavy shoes on the forehead, jumped on her body, And, keeping hold of her hair at the time, swore that as he had already had six months for il-using her, he would now have her life. She crawled under the bed, but he dragged her out by the hair of the head, and tore out her hair by handsful. The complainant here produced a large quantity of hair which had evidently been torn out by the roots.) Assistance having arrived, she got away from her husband. She was five months gone in the familyway. Her husband was in the habit of beating her.
The husband said his wife got drunk, and called Richard Doody to prove it.
The wife declared the charge was false.

TBAxs,-On Saturday last a poor man, named Francis Baker, who has seen better days, applhed to Mr. SExFE for relief from the poor-box fund, Eis story was a mnost pitiable one. He was formerly a tea warehousean, and about six months agova disabled by poisoning his hand, and had been out of employ ever since, and compelled to pawn or sel every aticle of furniture and apparel on which he could raisemoney for the sustenance of himself, his wife, and fivebhildren. Mis ife was confined with her sixth child three weeks since, and he was unable to provide her with any of those nourishments and comforts so necesry for a person in her situation. Directly after abe pae birth to an infant two of his children were attacked with fever, and he obtainedanorderfor Mr. Stephenson, one of the medical offfcers of the StepneyUnion, to visit his invaid cbildren, and be prescribed for them. Another ahild, 16 months old, was attacked with fever. Mfr Selfe observed that the poor man appeared very il and dejectel, and, having received a good character of him from an iuba-
bitant of Stepney, warded him a sovereign from the poorbox for the relef of his family.
Yesterday Mr. S.x sdted that he was much gratified at the receipt of several kttes enclosing donations for the relief of Baker and his destituto family, and said they should be paid over to the poor man, who, he hoped, would duly apreciAto the sympathl expresged on his behalf.

SOITnWARsx-Samuel Walker Kirk, a warehouseman in the employ of Messrs. George and Henry Scovell, of Symond's-wharf, Tooley-street, and Mr. George Rowe, of the firm of May and Rowe, hemp merchants, &c, Parade, Plymouth, were placed in the felons' dock at a late hour, charged with stealing 1 ton 7 cwt. of Riga hemp from the warehouse of Messrs. Scovell, in Tooley-street, Southwark.
Mf. Wontner appeared for the prosecution, Mr. Solomon defendedl Kirk, and r. Metcalf defended Rowe,
Mr. Wontner, in opening the case for the prosecution, Faid the charge he was aboutto make against the prisoners was of a very serions nature, especially atinst Mr. Row; who was a merchant of great respectabilitv at PI mouth. The prosecutors in the case were Messrs. Scovell, tie wellknown wharfingers in Tooley-street, who were ix the habit of receiving immense quantities of merchandise of almost every description consigned to merchants in London, which theywarehoused, and delivered only to their orders, consequently they were responsible for the property. They had a large quantity of hemp warehoused, belonging to Mxessrs. Scott, Rnssian merchAnts, and it appeared they had sold Mr. Rowe recently asmuch as 20 tons. An order was given by those gentlemen for that quantity to be delivered on board the Queen, a Plymouth vessel, which lay alongside Symond's-wharf, and on the 17th inst. Mr. Rowe came to that wharf to see it weighed and loaded, as it was consigned to him. From certain information received by the prose entors concerning three previous cargoes which Mr. pwe had at their wharf a watch was set over the person who bad the delivering of the hemp, and the police were near the spot. The weighng commenced, and instead of Kirk entermg the weights in a book kept for that purpose he wrote them on hlps of paper. Rowe ws standing by Kirk nearly all the time, watecing the draughts and speaking to him while the hemp was put on board the vessel. During that turne a workman was engaged to chalk the weights on a board as theyw re taken from the warehouse, but while his back was turned for a minute or so two of these chalks had been rubbed out each of which represented more than half a ton. After all the bemp had been taken from the warehouse, and nearly all shipped, Goodman, the superintendent, caused them to be all reweighed, under the care of another clerk, from Scovell's wharf when they were found to weigh 21 tons 700cwt. odd. Rowe had left the wharf, but the police were called, and Kirk was given into custody. After that an inspector was sent to Plymouth with a summons to com1. Mr. ov attendance to answer the charge.

Johr George Goodman, superintendent of Symond'swharf, who said the prisoner Kirk had been in the employ of Messrs. Scovell, as warehouseman, upwards of 10 years, and it was his duty to deUver goods from the warehouses to orders received from the countinghonse, also to gee them weighed and enter them in a book (produced) at the time, and afterwards sendthat and theorder backto tho countinhouse to be checked ofÂ£ On the 17th of the present nonth witness saw the delivery order (produced) signed " Scott and Son" for the deUvery of 20 tons of Riga hemp, to the order of Mr. Beer, who is the clerk of the South Devon-wharf, where vessels for that part of England lay. It was endorsed by Mr. Beer for delivery on board the Queen, which came alongside Symond's-wvharf. The delivery commenced at 6 o'clock in
the morning, and Kirk superintended the weighing of the hemp. Ahont 7 o'clock Mr. Rowe came, and witness knew thatse ehad purchased it, and that it was consigned to him. Rowve came up to witness and said he had come to see it weighed. Before be came the mate of the vessel wished nottogo on with the weighing until he came, when Rowe, Kirk, and the mate spoke together, and Rowe went several times on board the vessel. The weighing was finuished at h past lo'clock, and thehemp removed from the warehouseto thevesseL Afterthat wituess went into the countinghouse and consulted oneof theclerksabout the weight, when Mr. Rowe came in and paid the charges on 20 tons of hemp. Witness said to hMm he had received a communication that something was wrong as to the weights, and that he should have all the hemp unrshipped and reweighed. Rowe said, "Do as you like; I don't know that there is anything wrong." He also Laid that he must leave London b le 5 o'clock train, as a person In Plymouth who owed m some money had an execution in his house, and he must bo thero. He then went away. Witness ordered al the hemp to bo reweighed, and whUe that was going on Kirk came to him, when he told him it was a disagreeable affkir, and must be done. Kirk answered, "I Inow I have done wrong. I have given bim 12 beads (meaning bundles) over, to allow for waste." Such, however, is never done. The 12 beads were worth 21. 10s., and weighed 1l
cwt, Mr. Patmorea clerk from their other wharf, ascertained the weight 10 bo 21 tons 7 cwt. 2qrs. and 21b., instead of 20 tons. He then called in the police and gave Kirk into custody.
Witness nunderwent a lengthy cross-examination both by Mr. Soloman and Mr. Metcalf, but he made no material alteration in his evidence.
George Patmore, clerk to Messrs. Scovell, at Cottonwharf, proved the reweighing the hemp in the vessel and on the wbarf alongside. The gross amount was as stated by Goodman. Witness entered the weights at the time in the book produced. There wero about 30 cwt. on the quay, and the remainder were shipped.
Mr. Wontner, perceiving the time to be very late, observed to his Worship that he had no more witneSses to cal that day, but there vwas suicient evidence for a remand.
Mr. Solomon urged that there had been nothing proved *ginst his client, therefore he called on his Worship to dis-
rge him.
MIr. Metcalf made a similar appeal, stating that the gentleman he appeared for was a respectable merchant, and could not be guilty of the act imputed to hin.
Mr. CoiSz said there was suificient for a jury, therefore he should remand them for a week, at the same time accept good bail for their appearance.
Mr. Rowe was at once bailed out, and left the court with his friends. Kirk, not being provided with sureties, was removedto gaoL
IxBrm.-Wifli& Hammond and Wiliam Saunders were brought before Mr. ELLIOTr on a charge of violently assaulting Mr. George Rnkldn and covering his face with a thick layer of pitch, with intent to rob him.
Frormthe statement of the prosecutor, the left side of whose face was cut and contused in a very frightful manner, it appeared that on the night before he had beenato an election meeting at the Surrey-gardens, and subsequently joined some friends, with whom he had drunk rather freely, and stopped out long beyond his usual time. On nis way home he got "picked up" by the prisoners, who claimed acquaintance with him, and offered their services to take him home. On arriving at a secluded place near the raUway arch Saundes gave him a desperate blow, which knocked himdown and deprived hims of his senses for some moments. He called out lustily for the police, and two officers happening, fortunately, to be clOE by, they rushed to his assistanco. They fond the prosecutor lying on his back with a thick layer of pitch or tar over his faoe, and the PSt side of it seriously injured.
The prisoners denied the charge, but were remanded t a future day.

FLOnOIxG iN TRE Amiu.-From a return, moved for by Mr. W. Wiliams, late member for Lamboetb, it ap. pears that the number of persons flogged in the army of the united k-ingdom, in the year 1844, aumounted to 42, and -the number of ashes inflicted to 1,125 ; and in 1855, to 44, mumber of lasbes, 876.

THE EAST JNDDA POLICE Sysrmi LN3 BENGAL.-A ,copy of a despatch relating to the system of Police in the Bengal Presidency was laid before the late House of Commons, on the motion of Mr. Kinnaird, the ex-member for Perth. The Governor-General of India has had his attention directed of late, on various occasions, to the character snd proceedings of the police in different parts of the peni6nna, and the repcortslaid before bim have combined to depe theconictin tat a imediat an hrough Teform of the police in all the old provinces of British India is loudly called for. The evils to be contended with are to ibe found both in the charater and want of organization of the police. The police system is a thorough failure, the police being all but useless for the prevention, and sadly inefficient for the detection, of crime. To remedy the existing evils, it is proposed to separate the police from the admiie tration of the land revenue,-to take the management of the police of each district out of the hands of the snagistrate and commit it to a European officer, with no other duty to discharge, and, finaUy, to raise the stutu.s and secure the bonesty of the police. It is also thought advisable to divide the police into two separate portions-the preventive and the detective. This memorandum of the Governor-General in Council is dated the 24th of September, 1856.
The Administrative Reform Association and the Elections.
The ADMINISTRA TIV Y REFORM ASSO-
CIATION and the BLECTIONS.
TO THE ELECTORS OF TEE UNITED EKNT77mM
tentlemen,-We think that the present state of political affairs warrants our addressing you. We do so in the character of administrative reformers, and our purpose is to submit for your consideration observations upon your duties as electors at this very important period. We hope that our earnest desire to promote oar country's welfare will prove in your judgment a sufficient justification of our presumption in taking this step.
The Prihe Minister, by dissolving Parliament, has appealed to the publio from the decision of the House of Commons. But the trial of this issue, however important, ought not to divert your mainds fromother and still graver considerations. The approaching elections will not merely determinej whether the conutry approves the policy of Lord Palmerston in the affair of Canton, but will also decide upon the character of the legislation and government to which this country is to be subject for many years to come. If, in de. oiding on the personal question, we forget or pass over the great interests of the nation, we shall commit a grave error and do serious mischief. There is, however, great danger of our making this mistake. The public attention is, on the present occasion, so intently fixed upon the matter submitted to them by the Premier that all the great questions of policy upon which the welfare of this country depends seem likely to be neglected; and, while the electors are anxious to determine the question respecting Lord Palmerston's majority in the next House of Commons, they appear about to forget that in providing for that majority they may, perchance, send men to Parliament who will oppose every improvement in our institutions, and frustrate for years the hopes of IReformers of every class and character. The present are the circumstances most favourable to the plans of personal aggrandizement pursued by unscrupulous political adventurers. They find the public attention engrossed by one subject, and theyhope that,going with public opinion upon that one point, they may pass without question over matters far more important. 'Under the guise of friends of the present Administration you may send to Parliament, as your representatives, enemies to all reform, opponents of an extension of the suffrage, opponents of the ballot, opponents of all improvement in the administration of our navy and army, of the law, and of the management of our internal affairs. This is a consideration worthy of the most serious regard, and we look with great apprehen. sion upon the species of paroxysm into which the public mind has worked itself upon the present occasion.
Our purpose is to endeavour to recall to the public attention some of the matters which will seriously affect the well. being of the people, and upon which, if the people be wise, they wil demand explanations of all thecandidates for their suffrages; and we earnestly entreat of our countrymen not to be diverted from inquiring upon these matters by any declarations, however vehement, in favour of any particular men, or of any particular Addministration.
The instrument of all reforms in our government and ad. ministration is the House of Commons. The reform of that House ought therefore to be placed by aU thorough reformers, in the very front of their demands. The chief means to this desired end are-first, an extension of the suffrage; secondly, protection for the voter in the shape of the ballot; and, thirdly, a more equal arrangement of the electoral districts. Any man who evades giving an opinion upon these points, and who sesks to ward off inquiry respecting them, by any cajolery or declamation upon their use, and by earnest declaration of the support he intends to give the present Administration, is no true friend of the people, and ought to excite their distrust, and to be met with opposition.
Next in importance to reform in Parliament is the thorough reform of all ouradministrative departments. a those departments, as at present constituted, there is corruptionthere is jobbery-reward is gained by favour and influence, and not by merit. The fitting man is not the man sought after and chosen; but he is selected to serve the public who has the greatest number of friends who can be useful. The consequence has been and is that incompetence and blundering are evinced in all the operations of Government, and the people suffer because patronage reigns supreme. We had experience of the worklng of this system during the late operationsinthe Crimea. Oar army was brought to the brink of destruction by the officials who had to provide for it and direct its operations, and was only saved from ruin by the interference of the people and their representatives, who were made acqeuainted with the existing danger by the efforts of a press in all cases under the control of private individuals. So efficient was our official system of administration for purposes of mischief that the Government-that is, the leading members thereof-were as ignorant of the actual condition of things as the people themselves, and owed their first enlightenment to that very press which conveyed the startling intelligence to the public. This is a system which must be reformed. But, as herein the fruits of corraption are gathered, the difficulty of working out beneficial changes is enormous. Vague declarations in favour of administrative reform are very easy, and will be profusely made. But no man who is lukewarm, no man who is not earnestly and thoroughly a reformer, wil ever be found an effective minister of this reform.
To pursue undeviatingly this end, private interests must be forgotten, individual friendships must be passed over, party considerations must have no weight, the public weal must alone be considered; and he will be severely tried who honestly determines, and strictly adheres to his determina. ton, to brave all the blandishments of power, the solicitations of private affection and of party interests, and to follow only the public good in aU matters connected with the management of the countrv's affairs. The mere declaimer wil not do this; he who toregoes his own opinion to suit the taste of a constituency is just the man most likely to yield to the influences which, in support of jobbery and corruption, will beset him in public life. He who is pliant to a constituency is not likely to be the sturdy support of the popular cause in the strife of Parliament, nor steadily to resist the multitudinous seductions which beset the path of every man upon whom the people confer power by mak. ing him a representative.
There is one thing more to which we desire to caU your attention. To be an efficient representative, something more is required than merely to hold certain opinions. A high standard of moral woith and intellectual power is necessary for him who desires effectively to perform the duties of a representative. The ffippant declaimer, the noisy and fluent speaker of a hustings oration, does not, by his ready utterance and unblushing audacity, thereby prove himself to be worthy of the confidence of his countrymen. If a man have proved himself by his past life to be diligent in the inquiry after knowledge; if hb have given proof of his moral worth; if he be a strict adherent to the cause of truth, he may be a worthy representative, though not possessed of the ready fluency of a practised debater, or the artful sophistry of a trained advocate.
" Distrust, we beseech yeu, all who trust to the power of corruption and bribery. He who buys yoa will sel you. Money employed to purchase your suffrages is money employed for the purpose of obtaining a money return. A seat in Parliament bought from the people is almost invariably sold to the Minister.

Sir,-The report of this case in yourpaper of the 23d inst. is not correct, and is calculated to do me serious injury. There was no "brasabound coffin," and my bill contained no charge for a new suit of clothes and a black silk 8carf for the man in attendance to show the coffin. There was a eharge of 13s. for a silk hatband and gloves. The " pavvies" who follewed the deceased to the grave were his old confidential foreman and men, and were selected by Mr. Shelley, one of the executors. The charge for the funeral was 1881. 12s. 6d.; for the grave, expenses out of pocket, 551. lls. 10d.; for complimentary mourning sent after the funeral to the friends of the deceased and the principal officers of the North Western line, 1611. Os. 9d.; in all 4051. 5s. ld.* The brothers of the deceased and his residuary legatees have authorized me to state they are perfectly content with my charges, and much annoyed that my bill should have been disputed by tho executors.
I am satisfied that your reporter had no intention to exaggerate, and I trust to your sense of justice for an early insertion of this letter.

The Royal Academy of Music commenced its annual series of performances for the '" exhibition of the students" in Tenterden-street yesterday, with one of the best concerts we remember to have heard within the walls of the institution. The programme deserves to be quoted:-

Soloandchorus-"Etinfeamnatns" .. ::.. P asL
The Lauda Sion-composed by Mendelssohn in 1846 for the Church of St. Martin, Liege-has been more than once performed in England, but is not nearly so well known as it deserves, since it is one of the most chaste and beautiful of that great master's contributions to the music of the church. It was given on the present occasion with English words, under the title of " Praise Jehovah." The entire cantata was performed, and for the most part in a highly creditable manner although neither the band nor the chorus of the Academy is quite powerful enough for the satisfactory execution of such a work. The full pieces which produced the greatest effect were the magnificently accompanied chora1c, "H ere with saints" (one of Mendelssohn's most admirable examples of the elaboration of plain song by the aid of orchestral colouring), and the exquisitely melodious quartet with chorus, "T Thou didst free them," which terminates the work. The solo voico parts were carefully sustained by Misses Whyte and Shepherd, Messrs. J. Goodban and Towers. The cantata was thoroughly appreciated by the audience, and a general feeling of gratification was evinced that the attention of the students should have been directed to a comparatively new composition of such high and classical worth.
The next piece was hardly so successful. MendeLssohn set a portion of the 55th Psalm for soprano solo, chorns, and organ, and afterwards scored the instrumental part for the orchestra. The " pa7 titwn " is, we presume, in possession of the legatees intrauted with the arrangement and pubHcation of his manuscripts-a labour they have accomplished with such lamentable absence of enthusiasm. Mendelssohn never contemplated a pianoforte for accompaniment in his cantata, unless in drawing-rooms, whereorgan or orchestra is equally out of the question. It was, therefore, scarcely Academic to produce the psalm in such a form; and, while Miss Spiller displayed both energy and feeling in her rendering of the soprano solos (which-more especially the last, " Oh that I had wings like a dove"-wouald have gained by being taken a little faster), and while Mr. White played the part allotted to the pianoforte both with taste and correctness, the music inevitably suffered.
Miss Mackenzie, who attempted the contralto air from the second part of Elijah, has a voice as yet undeveloped, and a method equally unformed. In short, she has almost everything to learn. Miss Whyte-a mezzo soprano-appears at the present tirae the most promising singer of the institution. She has feeling and sensibility, and-which, if she be young, as we imagine, is of stil more conseauence-decided indications of style. Her notion of phrasing is good; and her voice (which she must be studious not to damage by straining) betrays that quality which the Italians very suggestively designate "sympatca." Her delivery of the somewhat " bag-wigged" air from Haydn's StabatAfater was capital.
The choraZfantasa of Beethoven went effectively, notwithstanding that almost every part of it was taken too slow. Slow and sure, however, is probably the adopted motto of Mr. Lucas on these occasions, and doubtless its application is not unfrequently beneficial. The pianoforte part was performed by Mins Emily Parton, in many instances extremely well; in others (where florid execution was demanded) less successfully. The young lady has promise, however, which diligent practice may ripen into excellence.
The selection from Mr. Costa's Eli embraced four chornses, the least admirable points in the performance, with oneexception, "The Lord is good,"which was extremely well sung. The solos devolvedupon Misses Bignall, Fosbroke. and Shepherd. Miss Fosbroke exhibited hopeful talent in the air of Hannah, " I wiU extol Thee, O Lord" and Miss Shepherd still more seriously claimed attention in the Morning and Evening Prayers, both of which (the last more particularly) she delivered with genuine expiession, making evident, at the same time, the fact that she possesses a contralto voice of pare and beautifal qunity. The singers in the terzetto from Athalie were Misses Spiller, Whyte, and Kate Foster; in the duet from Rossini's Staoat (an interesting contrast to Haydn's setting of the same hymn) Misses Bignall and Shepherd; while the "Iniammatus," from the same work, was intrusted to Miss Janet Whitehead. Our critical remarks, however, are exhausted.
Mr. Lucas was conductor, and M Sainton ctef dadaquc. The rooms were crowded to overflow, and his Royal Highness Prince Albert honoured the performance with his presence. Seldom has an Academy concert (although not one composition of a student was introduced) afforded greater satisfaction.
The Merchant Shipping Act.
THE MEBCHANT SHIPPING ACT.
SOUTHIAIPTON, MONDAY.
A public meeting of commercial and shipping gentlemen connected with this port was held at the Town-hall this afternoon, " to take into consideration the present state of the law as regards the proceedings adopted by the Board of Trade in their inquiries affecting the commanders of merchant ships, with the view of memorializing the Government to readjust that part of the Merchant Shipping Act which refers to this particular." The meeting was very numerously attended by captains and other officers of the various mail steamship companies located at this port, and other gentlemen interested in the prosperity of oar mercantile marine.
On the motion of Captain J. R. ENGLEDUE (superintendent of the Peninsular and Oriental Company), seconded by Captain SAWYER, Captain J. Strutt (the examiner to the Royal Mail Company, and superintendent of the Company's Officers' Home at this port) was voted to the chair, and introduced the business of the meeting with a few preliminary remarks.
Captain ENGLEDrUE moved the first resolution, and in doing so entered into a statement of the grievances complained of. The first point contended for was that the merchant service should have the same justice extended to them as military and naval officers, who, when charged with any offence, were put upon their trial before courts constituted of their own body, and who were therefore competent to Judge of the merits of the question. Another question related to the operation of the Passengers Act, which prevented British shipowners from fairly competing with foreigners. A Belgian steamer might arrive at this port with 600 passengers on board, and could take on board 100 or 200 more here without any interference; but an English merchant ship of the same power would be compelled to take a very much smaler number. They had at present fitting out at this port a splendid fleet of steamships, lately belonging to the General Screw Company, on whom this Act would press most heavily. There was the Golden Fleece, which was about to ron in conjunction with the Teutonia ard Petropolis, sailing under the Hambnurg flag. They might take passengers on board at Antwerp without restriction, but as soon as the Golden Fleece came here the emigration officer or Collector of Customs goes on board, and says, "You havetoo many persons on board, and you must land some of them." And under the present Act the order must be obeyed. This was very unfair, and the law must be altered. The speaker enumerated other grievances, among which was Lord Campbell's Act, making owners of ships responsible for the support of re. latives of persons whose lives might be lost by accidents. He also contended that the Marine Department of the Board of Trade should be composed of mercantile men, and complained of the manner in which captains of merchant ships who might be so unfortunate as to lose their ships or be subjected to any accident were put upon their trial as though they were only common felons. Nothing could be worse or more unjust than the manner in which the officers and men engaged in the transport service during the late war had been treated by the Government. Their services had been unnoticed, and unthanked alnost, by any one connected with the Government of the country. He referred to the loss of the Prince and the Resolute, and contended that the Government were bound in justice to give a pension to the widows and orphans of every person who had perished in those ships. The administration of the Patriotic Fund, which had been so generously contributed to by the country, was grossly unjust to those engaged in the transport service, who were as unquestionably acting for the welfare and benefit of their coumtry as the members of the army and nsvy were. Captain Engledue concluded a spirited and lengthened address by moving the first resolution, which, with those subsequently adopted, will be found in our advertising columns.
Captain STErWART, of the European and Australian Royal Mail Company, seconded the resolution, remarking that it was manifestly unfair for landsmen to sit in iudgment on nautical men.
The resolution was put rom the chair and carried unanimously.
Captain FIELD (Peninsular and Oriental Company) mnoved, and Captain MxrHvxmf (Peninsular and Oriental Company) seconded, the next resolution. Referring to the late Court of Inquiry into the loss of the Ma drid, Captain Mlethven remarked that he could not help obserning that as at present constituted such courts were composed of landsmen, who received their bias from a man not practically *cquainted with the rapid progress of navigation at the present day. Ho had no objection to magistrates or townsmen being associated with mquiries of this nature, but he did want to see a large influence therein of men of their own class, so that men who met with an accident to their ships might be judged of by those who thoroughly understood the whole bearings of the question.
The remainder of the resolutions were severally proposed and seconded by Mr. Philip Hedger (superintendent of the Southampton Docks), aptains Tregear, Clhistian, and Evans (of the PeninsuLor and Oriental CQspanOt)

SERMONVS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIES.
Sir,-Whatever may be thought of the taste or discretion I of your correspondent "Habitaus in Sicco," one thing mst be admitted,-he has hit the blot of the Church of England. Tested by their ermonB the clergy of the establishment might be said to bave no knowledge of the wants, spiritual and temporal, of their hearers ; and-what is worse -no sympathr with them. They lose the opportunity which they have of speaking with a homely and affectionat3 earnestness to the labourer and the mechanic, to the washerwoman, his wife, and his daughter, the milliner's apprentice, to the shopboy and the maid-of-all-work. The parish priestmightwarnthemof theirpeculiartrials, doubts, difficulties, and temptations, and guide them and encourage them through all But he does nothing of the kind. His bearers are fed with the husks of barren and un profitable disquisitions on matters which they do not understand, and about which they do not care ; and the rev. orator is filled with indignation on discovering that as the parish church is growing empty so the chapel becomes crowded.
Now, Sir, I do not attribute this to any want of sympathy with the people. We must seek the reason elsewhere; and we shall not have far to seek. It is simply want of ability. As a body the clergy of the Church of England are the worst preachers in Christendom, because they are the only religious community who neglect to teach the art of speaking in public. And of this neglect they re now paying the penalty. The incumbent and the curate of the parish are generally well informed and well disposed men, diligent in the discharge of their duties (of course, there are exceptions), alive to the importance of education, kind to the sick, and able to help the poor man in his dis. tress; yet, despite all these qualifications, which should place them on the highest vantage ground, the clergy are playing a losing game, they cannet hold their own, they cannot keep their flocks together. The labourer is pleased to see the parson everywhere but in the pulpit; and the half hour spent under that infliction too often undoes the good which the dreary, but well meaning preacher has been labouring to accomplish during the whole of the previous week.
So much for the disease, its origin, and its symptoms. Now for the remedy. It is a simple one. It consists only in this, that before men are required to preach in public they should know something about public preaching. Why not ascertain by examination that they are "aptto teach?r Whynot let them give proof that they are competent to do what the Ordination Service require;, "' to exercise their ministry duly to the honour of God and the edifying of His Church 1" As matters stand at present the Church of England, with all her vaunted powers of education, leaves untau'ght this most important element of clerical training; and the power of speaking from the pulpit "to edification," if e.er gained at all, is gained only by long experience, by the memory of many a humbling failure, by the consciousness of having thinned many a congregation and the fear of having starved many a hungry soul' Through this purgatorial fire the Church of England com pels the more earnest minded of her clergy to pass; can -we wonder that the many shrink back and refuse to haaard the experiment? The remedy lies with those who have the charge of educating the clergy. Let an effort be made to teach men sometbing of the art of winning the affections and touching the consciences of their hearers. The man who will work this reform in the educational system of our theological colleges will do more for the real interests of the Church of England than all the vapid speeches with which we are about to be dinned at Exeter-hall, and all the angry protests which await us from St. Paul's and St. Barnabas.
I am. Sir.
VOX CLAMANTIS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-May I ask you, as a well-wisher to the Church of England, to insert these few lines? " Habitans in Sicco " complains of the ministers of that Church, and specially of their inefficiency in the pulpit. The complaint is a just one; and no wonder. Are the examinations to which each candidate for orders has to submit true tests of their abilities as clergymen? Certainly not. AU that was proved in my own case when I was examined a few years ago (and the examinations, I have reason to know, were very good speci
mens of their class) was this,-that I had a very fair knowledge of the Bible and Prayerbook, ecclesiastical history, evidences, doctrine, and ritual- But surely this does not prove that I was fit to unadertalke the varied office of the ministry. I might be utterly incapable of preaching, utterly incapable of good reading, or teaching in schools, or parochial visitation, for all that my examiners knew. And do not these for the most part make up the round of a clergyman's daily duties? Yet they approved me, utterly ignorant of my capacity or incapacity in these respects. I submit, then, Sir, if we are to have an efficient ministry we must have efficient examinations. For this purpose one of two courses might be taken. Either every candidaze for orders, besides the present tests, should be also thoroughly tested in preaching, reading, teaching, and parochial visitation, and if, after fair trial in each, he did not come up to a certain standard, be rejected, or else different men should have different offices assigned them in the Church, each according to his ability, supposing, of course, that every one who presented himself as a candidate was fit for some special branch of duty, if not for alL Something like this must, I am convinced, be done, or we shall never have such an efficient ministry in the Church of England as we ought to have.
Your obedient servant.

A Cemetery Grievance.
A CEMETERY _GPEVA.VCE.
TO THE EDITOB OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Will you allow me to state, through the columns of your journal, the anomalous position in which the parish of Rickmansworth is placed by the refusal of the Bishop of Rochester to consecrate the newly-formed cemetery in the
By the bishop's refusal the inhabitants of the parish are subjected to very serious inconvenience, the graveyard of the parish church having been closed by order in Council since the 1st of January last. The simple' facts are these: -The burial board held that of al the stes presented for their consideration the most eligible for the purposes required was a portion of the glebe land (arable) which was purchased of the late Bishop of London, he being the rector, and the rectorial tithe being of the annual value of 1,4001. Two acres of the glebe were purchased at 150l per acre, and, notwithstanding the highprice demanded bythebishop for the land, he refused to bear his (the customary) share of the law costs associated with the transfer of the land ; so that these two acres of arable land-by no means of good quality-inclusive of the tenants' interest, has cost a poor parish something over 5001. Two-thirds of the whole quantity are set apart for members of the Established Church and the remaining third for the Nonconformists, the respective portions being divided by a well-made gravel road of 20 feet wide. There is a well-built chapel on each portion of the land, the whole enclosed by a boundary fence of brick, flint, stone, andiron; entrance gates, sexton's lodge, &c. By;way of avoiding the possiuility of inviting anything like a feeling of hostility on the part of the Dissenters towards the church, there being only one Dissenter on the board, it was very wisely held by the burial board that a road of 20 feet was a suffidiently dis tinctive mark of separation. The ground is again subdivided into grave spaces, with well-made gravel paths, and the whole of the ground well planted with ornamental shrubs of various kinds, the whole now presenting no unsightly object in the neighbourhood, the board having conformed in every particular with the Act of Parliament under which they were appointed, and will, I believe, when the few outstanding liabilities are discharged, have expended nearly or quite the whole of the funds which the parishplaced at their dispoeal-vix, 1,9001. The board have received the approval of the Secretary of State of their entire proceedings, and for some time past have had his sanction for opening the cemetery in question. Yet, notwithstanding thlat the bishop has had these facts fairly placed before him, and that the hoard have, moreover, in a memorial forwarded to his Lordship some time since, showvn that the road of 20 feet wide is a much more distinctive line of demarcation than that required by other diocesans who have consecrated cemeteries of recent formation within a range of from eight tol8miles of this place,tothe number of some seven or eight, nevertheless his Lordship refuses to comply with the wishes of the board, and obstinately insists that the board shall partition off the respective grounds (which would entirely destroy the good effect of the whole) with a divisional fence of either stone, flint, brick, or iron. The board have, as I think very properly, refused submission to this arbitrary irqement. Theresult is that the bishop seems determinied to render inoperative, to a great extent, the labours of the board in carrying out the provisions of the Act, by bis positive refusal to consecrate, otherwise than upon his own terms, that portion of the groud set aaart for the inw termentof deceasedrembersnof the Established Church,who are at the present time without a place of sepulture according to the rites of the Established Church. For the correction of such evils as I have here detailed we must rely largely on your powerful advocacy, for if the bishop car by any twisting which the law admits exercise such unchristian and arbitrary power the sooner he is deprived of it the better. The Bishop of Rochester has only the power of eedesiasticaljur-isdiction over the parish of Rickmansworth, in virtue of some arrangements having been entered into between himself and the late Bishop of London in the way of exchange of duties.
I remain, Sir, your obedient servant.
