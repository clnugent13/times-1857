The supply of money for loans on Government sLcurities was abundant during the morning at from -i to 6 per cent., but there was apparently less ease -towards the end of the day. Bank Stock left off at -213 to 215; Reduced, 91 to 92; New Three per -Jents., 92 toi; India Stock, 220 to 223; India Bonds, 8s. to 4s. discount; l!xchequer-bonds, 9S} Xt i; and Exchequer-bills (June), Cs to is. dig-count; (MIarch), 2. discount to 2X. premiumn. Forei,gn secuities wee steady, and prices in some eases showed increased firmness. Turkish Six per Cents. for money were negotiated at.941, and for Ahe account at 94j; and the Four per Cent. Guawanteed for money at 100k. The general businesa included-Mexican Three per Cents., 23k; Sardinian Five per Cents., for the account, 90g and i; -Spanish Three per Cents., 41k; and Duteh Twoacwd-a-Half per Cents., 65. The final quotation of the lrenchThree per Cents. -on the Paris Bourse this' evening was 69f. 30c. both {or money and account, showing continued dulnesa. At Hamburg the rate of discount is again 7 per cent. The European and American steamer Golden :leeee, w}hiclh eails for Brazil to-morrow, will take -out abost 83,0001., principally sovereigns. It is -believed that these remittances are not a result of the natural course of trade, but that they have been -9btained at an artificial price by the Rio Bank in -order temporarily to strengthen its position. The expediency of an earlier publication of the lweekly returns of the Bank of England has often een discussed, and the writer of the following comnmunication is undoubtedly correct in asserting that -dases constantly occur in which the knowledge pri-vately possed vith regard to them before they are furnished to the general public is employed for -speculative purposes, not necessarily by any of the -directora, but tbrough the indiscretion of some of -them in conversing with their personal friends. This evil, under the preent system, is incur.able, since the governora and leading direc- or?, and also the Court as a bcody, have in vain made the most strenous efforts to trace it to its -source. If for no other reason, therefore, the pub4ication of the return up to the end of each week in -the Gazedte of the Tuesday instead of that of the Friday following should be resolved upon. There :are, however, many additional and imperative :motives for the change. Thesereturns are intended! to enable the public to foresee and prepare against -the probable fluctuations in the value of money, and it has been rightly urged that under the Currency Act of 1844 they afford auch a perfect barometer in this respect that there can be no excuse for uny trader who may permit himself to be caught in an approaching Btorn. But the prepent delay deprives them of much of their -value. Three weeks back a large portion of the public was taken by surprise at the sudden announcement of the advance of the rate of discount -to 64 per cent. Nothing in the returns published ,up to that date had indicated the certainty of any Auoh movement. But the Bank directors were acting upon a return made up two days previously, -which showed a falling off in the bullion of 640,0001., and which might at that time have been published to all the world, so as to -give notice of the impending change. It is true there are someconsiderations ontheoppositesidewhich may *be cited to absolve the directors from any intentional -disregard of the duties of publicity or of the general -convenience of the commercial world. The preparationa of the accounts, to be in time for the Gazette of Tuesday, would possibly involve some slight difficulties; and there is also the argument that if the public were to observe on any Wednesday morning a great diminution of the bullion they would rush -to get all their bills discounted at the existing rate bore the Court could deliberate at their Thursday weekly meeting on the advisability of increasing -their terms. But this would be easily met, xince the Governor could advance the rate -on the Wednesday if the applications were such as to render it requisite, and the Court could on the next day modify or adhere to the step at pleasure. Moreover, it would be a great 'advantage if the habit of leaving the rate to be fixed by the weekly Court were altogether discontinued, -4nd the system were accommodated each day to the qver-fiuctuating relations of supply and demand:- " Sir,-May I Ask you to allow me space inyonr columns to inquire why the weekly Bank returns are not published in the Gczette of Tuesday, instead of being withheld until Yriday night I At the present time, when the Bank has in -4,wo weeks diminished its issues by canceUinD its notes to -the amount of 380,0001. and 639,800l. (say, 1,0l9,8001. and -diminished its bullion by a like sum, it Is certainly a matter of importance to the commercial world to be put in posses. - sion of theso returns at the earliest moment possible. As a bank of issue only, there can be no difficulty in closing the accounts on Saturday night, and, unless there is great delay in receiving the balances from the branch banks, which are included in tne present returns, I see no reason why they should not bo ready for Tuesday night's Gazette. " That an approximate result is known to the initiated loew early in the week is a fact wbich cannot be disputed, -and the best means to prevent such improper knowledge will be the earlier publication of the returns, I "I am, Sir, yours faithfully, London, April 14. " H." The annexed relates to the Russian railway scheme:- " I see in your Money Articlo that the Russian railway .iproject is to have a guarantee of 4 U-12ths per cent. the .-question I ask, and should be obliged by your answering, is, supposing the takings on the line not sufficient to pay the -working expenses, who is to make up the deficiency? " ONE WHO DOUBTS RUSSIA," The answer to the above is, that the deficiency -will apparently have to be made up by the shareholders, who will also be called upon for a further -sum, in case the construction of the lines shaRll cost more than the amount estimuated. The prospeotus is far from explicit on the most important points -connected with the liability of the shareholders, while it is precise and unhesitating in the daring 'and preposterous estimate that the working expenrses will be limited to 45 per cent. At the Court of Bankruptcy to-day a dividend -was declared under the estate of Mr. C. J. Mare, late a shipbuilder of Blackwall, but the amount at Tpresent cannot be precisely determined. In the -case of Mr. W. Smith, late of the Hemel lHempstead Bank, the consideration of the certificatewas adjourned. The following letter furnishes a useful statement -of the condition of the law as regards the question I -of limited liability in connexion with joint-stock banks:- " Sir,-As many shareholders are much perplexed regarding the position of banks professing to be carried on under Royal charter, and as the examination of the diree- i *tors themselves of the late Royal British Bank proves how lamentably ignorant even they are on the state of the law, the followving summary concerning joint-stock banks acting -nder the law as it now stands may be acceptable to many -of your readers, and perhaps may also save them much -uneasiness caused by the recent disclosures in connexion. 'with the British and the London and Eastern Banks:- ' Within the last 100 years, and previous to 1844, theI Crown, by virtue of the Royal prerogative, and in exercise -of that right, has granted several charters with limited L;a4uihty to banks for carrying on business in Great Britain -nd freland, such as the Bank of England, Bankof Ireland, Bank of Scotland, Royal Bank of Scotland, the British Linen Company and Commercial Bank of ScoUand, in all ,of which tho liability is limited to the amount of the shares hbeld. " In 1844 Peel's well-known Banking Act was passed, by E ich the Crown gave up and abandoned the Royal right or jircrogative to grant charters for home banking, and that -Act provided that henceforth it should only he lawful to commence business under 'letters patent,' and that the -Clown 2et ht, -with consent of the Lords of . Pritey Council ,for Trade, 1 ue such 'Iletters patent' in terms of the various I regulations, restriction; &o, mentioaned in the Act iteelf. 'Ote very important omission in that Act is the absence -entirely of any clause reticting or empowering the Crown to resterit the lisbility of vhazebolders, and the consequence :is that no bankig,%comepany incorporated for home bwankng since 1844 could otain limited Iliability. "1By a conifusion of idea, and an improper applic-ation of -terms, the banks for home banking so incorporated have invariably advertisedl themselves as acting under a I'Royal charter,' that term is used over and over again by the directors of the Royal British Bank, whereas the Queen had no power to grant, and no Royal hbazter ever was qranted -to that hank, the document being the more modifed and less comprehensive thing called 'letters patent;' and it is by tis missapplication of the right name to a wrong subject that much of the existing ignorance on the liabiity of :shareholdezs has been fostered, and perhaps even encou. raged. "Peel's Act left the Royal prerogative perfectly untcuched and unfettered in so far as the colonies and foreign ,States were concerncd. 'ihe consequence has been that the Queen by right of that power inherent in the Crown has granted real 'charters' with limited liability to various ,colonial companies since 1844 for banking in India, China, Australia, and Canada, and also to various English com}aDnies for banking in and with fo:eign countries, but having itbeir head-quirters in Leadon, for the promotion of the itrade and commerce of Great Britain. "In 'these later companies sO incorporated by 'Royal barter,' the liability of thareholders at the time of the diselation of tX cornpany fs limited to double the Amount of the shares bold at the time of winding up, should there be any deficiency to meet the okli,gations of the company; and the benefit of a 'charter' under the Royal prerogative.is such that all shareholders whose shares have been duily transferred previous to that dt-vizt the date of the dis. Folution-are theieby relieved from all liability whatever. Such is the inherent power of a Royal 'charter.' "I am, Sir, your obedient servant, " LEX." The returns of circulation of the Irish and Scotch banks for the four wveeks ending the 14th of March, when added together, give the following, as the average ireekly circulation of these banka during the past month, viz.:- Average circulation of the Irish banks ... ... Â£7,173,209 Average circulation of the Scotch banks ... 3,828,478 Average circulationl during past month ... Â£11,001,687 On comparing the above with the fixed issues of the several banks, as given in the Bankkn Almanac, the following appears to be the state of the circulation:- The Irish banks are above their fixed 3ssue .. Â£818,715 The Scotch banks are above their fixed issue . 741,269 Total above the fixcdaue ... ... ..n . 1,559,98i The amounts of gold and silver held at the head offices of the several banks during the past month have been as follows - Gold and silver held by the Irish banks ...

These returns, combined with the average circulation of the Bank of Engl2nd for the innae period, will give the following results of the circulation of notes in the United Kingdom when compared with the previous month- showing a decrease of 395,5421. in the circulation of notes in England, and a decrease of 605,5701. in the circulation of the United Kingdom, when compaed with the month ending the 14th of February. And, as compared with the maonth ending the 15th of March, 1856,the above returns show a decrease of 12,7651. in the circulation of notes in England, and an increase of 577,5961l in the circulation of the United Kingdom. The average stock of bullion held by the Bank of England in both departmnents during the month ending the 14th of March waA 10,339,1421., being an increase of 215,3511. as compared wth the previous month, and a decrease of 230,6121. when compared with the same period last year. The stock of specie held by the Scotel and Trish banks during the month ending the 14th of March was 4,243,4521., being a decrease of 190,3971. as compared with the previous return, and an increase of 367,0201. when compared with the corresponding period last year.

STATE OF TRLDE. NOTTIN~GHAM, Ai'uM 23. The lace trade continues in a languid state. Some manufacturers are resorting to the system of selling lote by tender in London, and about 30,0001. worth of goods have been sentup this week, somne of 'which have been sold at a reduotion o 60 per cent. ; in some cases even more. One manufacturer is said to have taken off 80 per cent. This interferes most injurionslv with legitimate trading, for it is hadly to be expected that London buyers will vit our rcarket and make purchases when goods can be had at home almost at their own price. Manufacturers complain of the low vrices offered for goods. The hosiery trade is also dull, and both yarns and silk continue very high. LEICESTER, APRL 23. There is still a good inquiry for cotton articles, worsted goods being almost entirely neglected. Prices offered are very low, but there is little doubt that an advance must ho given.

THE GREAT ATLANTIC SUBMARINE TELE. GRAPH CABLB. TO THE EDITOR OF TEIE TIMES. Sir,-Will you allow me to assure the writer of the article under the above heading in your impression of today that his apprehenstona in regard to the Atlantic line are groundless, and that the form of cable now being manufactured has not been hastily adopted. I wil not remark upon the lkind of cable which he so earnestly advocates, for the columns of a scientific journal are more suited to such a discussion, but I must say that I do not wish any'antagonist so certain a loss as the endorsement of Mr. Allan's theories by an experiment of their value upon a largo scale. I do not know upon whose authority he ventures to rash in upon us so boldly with the assumption that our conducting wire is "ridiculously smalL" I have bad somepractical experience for some years in working telegraphio lines, and have had, as engineer to the MIagnetic Telegraph Company, the charge of the greatest length in the world of subterranean wires, the conditions of which are electrically the same as those of submarine wires; and Mr. Whitehouse, the electrician to the Atlantic Telegraph Company, has been engaged for a long time in experiments upon sab. marine conductors. We are not oppressed by any fears as to the electrical success of the cable; and, to my mind, the alteration in the conductor, by using return wlres, which your article alludes to, would be (to follow up the writer's simile) like laying an additional pair of rals over a long line of railway, when a modification in the fom of locomotive employed would answer every purpose. It would be more aceful for those who are withont that knowledge of telegraphic matters which practical expeence alone can teach to pause before they thrust forward their theories so positively.

(Hour hear.) When we look around us and tee the temptations that aie offered to youngmen to pursue a vicious course of life- when we look at the casinos and other places of public amusement, to many of which infamy and crime owe theirorigin, I do think that it is the hounden duty of the Corporation to do what they can to assit an institution which has for its object the amusement and instruction of the young men of London. SOme very interesting associations are connected with this institution, which has been succesful in its operations up to the present time.

CH.A?N0B OF THE FRARxliw EXPZDITION.-We have shown in a Previous discussion of the mibject that it is by no means rndiculous or extravagant to think it nossible that some (if only two orthree) of Sir3Johinimrle ompanions, vigorous menwho went out, at. tbz age of 26 or 28, aud would be now, as to their yeas, of the age when men have biut attained their eomplete ripeness and strength, may have taken refuge amongtheEsquimaux, as Dr. Kane declaled thbA it "required all his powers, moral and physical, to prerent' his men from doingwhen they also were placed in acritiekl position. Dr. Kane says of himself and his men, "we regarded the coarse life of these people with eyes of envy, and did not doubt but that we could have lived in comfort npontbeir resoures" It is clearly possible, then, that at leat one Englishman may still be living among the Esquimaux, parted by a vast and impnaable tract of desert continent from the most northem settlements of his own countrymen, and to whom ithe 9ght of a deliverer would bring such joy as we who live all tho years through among friends and in families are utterly unable to imagine. We have already pointed out how the behaviour of tne Esquimaux has led morethan one A-ctie eailor to believe that tbey know something about Sir John Franklin's crews, that they sTe indisposed to tell what they know, aid that it nee4s time and tactto extract their knowledge from them. The space of ground within which it is now certin that Franklin's ships were lost, and probable tthat their disabled hulls are to be found, is of so limited extent that even on maps of a considerable size it. may be covered with a shilling. To Cambridge Bay. on one side of this region, a --le sailing vessel has pawed -nd returned heme unscathed, its commander xpresng ,his voniction that the passge is so contatly ope tbat ships ean iaz Bate it without diIficulty in one seaon. lo the- tier aide of this region there is a choiee ci routee, and the point that 'would be reached by a vessel entering Peel Sound woulg, probably, be less than 200 iniles distant from thbe liit of t'ce area of i ohn thewetern aide.

LONDON, FRIDAY, APRIL 24, 1857. " Old, old, Master SHALLow I"-" Nay, she V' must be old; she cannot choose but be old; V' certain she's old; and had RoBI NiGoTCC woRK, by Old NioHTwonx before I came " to Clement's-inn." " That's fifty-five years 44 ago." Master SiALLow and his friend SiLsNas were right. We axe al of us getting old, and lapse 'of time greatly contributes to this change. The general rule is most certain and admits of but few modifications. We may grow old faster or slower. There are those who enjoy a fresh juvenescence in their latter days. Wit, poetry, and kindness are always young, and clothe the driest old stump with a youth of its own. On the other hand, there are those who uever were young, who were born old, or, perhaps, were bred in the society of veterans. There have been precocious little gentlemen who could extract cube roots or Hebrew roots with equal facility while their contemporaries were playing at marbles. There is, too, that little man who exhibits himself in Regent-street, who was NAPoLoN OrWELLINGTON at the age of seven, and is now a Cupid at the age of twenty-three. Can anybody remember the time when Lord JOHN RUSSELL was not on his legs advocating civil and religious liberty, an extension of the franchise, and a select circle of safe, abstract, and comprehensive reforms ? Be has never once varied that performance. A musical snuffbox or an automaton tailor is not truer to its one office than Lord JouN to his. "All "c work and no play makes JAcK a dull boy," and for want of a few months now and then Lord *JoBx RUSSELL can hardly give us even a variation on the old tune. Undoubtedly he did some considerable things in his day, but we don't want him to be always doing them. There is a time to have done. There was hardly a great man or a great people of antiquity -who was not described as Nil actum reputans duzm quid superesset agendumr, and a great authority tells us this should be a Christian's rule. But, when there is a mountain of work still to be done, Lord JoENt RUSSELL is counting up the past and picturing himself as a great historical persoD age. Grant that you are one, Lord JonN; yet allow us to submit one or two qualifying circumstances. Those were huge arrears, propounded and ventilated half a century before. When their time came at last you were selected to work them through the Commons, because you were then a handy, enter- pring, and well-behaved little mun But tho time has now come for work of rather another kind, more suited to these days. A certain College had an immense accumulation of books in caes and presses, for which it built a spacious new library, and the Senior Fellows bravely devoted one long vacation to arranging the books on the shelves. But they could not run up and down the tall library steps as nimbly as they once had done; so they looked about them, and saw a handy little graduate, a decent scholar, and one who could fetch and carry. Him they elected Fellow, and employed for three months on this rather Sisyphian toiL The snmmer was hot and the books were dusty, and that little gentleman complained to his dying 'day that, in spite of certain frequent applications, he never got the dust quite down his throat. My Lord Jon?r Russam, the dust of those everlasting old Bills is still in your throat. It is always choking you. Wash it down with something or other-port, brown stout, or the pure element, whichever you please ; but, for goodness' sake, no 3nore about the Test and Corporation Act, the Catholic Emancipation Act, the Parliamentary Reform Act, the Municipal ditto, and all the rest of them. It is true that LIord JoHN is now ingenious in disguises. He tries to veil his glories, and let them peep out. He has been staying near Southmoulton, and, the Corporation of that place having presented him a complimentary address, LordJoHN has taken the opportunity of reminding the British public once more of his existence before the meeting of Parliament. In doing this he has had recourse to some modest generalities, in which, besides avoiding certain phrases of too frequent recurrence, he handsomely permits the British nation to divide with him the honour of his political achievements. Of course, we become interested in admitting their value. "For "the last 30 years," he says, "beginning in " 1828, we have been making great changes in " our laws, altering the basis of our Parliamentary " representation, admitting millions of our fellow" subjects to the benefits of religious equality, " enlarging our commercial hberties, and extend" ing the privileges of personal freedom to "men of every race and every colour, in "whatever clime they could be reached by the I "beneficent sceptre of the British monarchy." All this, by this time, is as NrsTOnes thrice-told tales, and no novelty of languago will detain the young and hopeful on the history of the age gone by. The future, the future, is what they look to; and here the document before us is vague and obscure, or simply a reflection of the past. " May we not hope, "then, gentlemen," says Lord Jom? RussELL, "that by following Oue same policy, by uniting " progress with order, and improvement with wC isdom, we may attain still further and greater "benefita? ' The opinion of the good,' says "MToN, 'is knowledge in the making.' By "consulting the opinion of the good and the "enlightened, the House of Commons recently "elected may fnd a means to promote education, "to extend political franchises, to enlarge the "boundaries of religious freedom by re"moving some remaining disabilities, and " to relieve the people of some of their " vexatious burdens." Why, this is only round and round again to the starting point. The only item in this list that was not in the Thirty Years' War just described is education, otherwise it is all franchise and disability over again; and when a whole generation has been passed in admitting Disenters, Papists, and smaU householders to Par. liament and corporations, the happy result is that we have to begin the work over again. NTow, without ourselves volunteering to specify the points on which a British Parliament may be better employed just now than in mending our conatitution, we beg to submit one simple test which, in our humble opinion, shows Tnaa LOra JON Rusaa, has shut himself up in a little world of his own. We appeal to almost any one of our ordinary readers, and we will suppose him not to be in vety exceptional circumstances. We will also suppose him to meet and converse with dozens of people of all kinds, and to talk with them more or les confidentially. They have all their own wishes and complaints, wants to be relieved, favourite objects to be compassed, grievances to be redressed, and as forth. All Englishmen have. The test we apply, then, is this :-What proportion of those persons that one meets every day has a personal or particular interest in any of the future objects of legislation summed up by Lord Jomr Russ=? Has one in ten? Hlas one in twenty? Excepting only that he, and we, and almost everybody has his views about education, there is literally not a point in which any man one meets with is specially interested. We may desire to see the "vexatious burden" of Churchrates removed, but otherwise it is a point on which few can have any personal feeling. Give LordJoN RPUSSELL full swing for the next thirty years to do all that he professes to wish, and not one man in twenty would be a bit the better for it. There is much that we desire to see done from personal or patriotic feelings, such as the rerorm ot the iaw, the improvement of our cities and large populations, a social organization better adapted for spontaneous progress and self-elevation, increased facilities for trading, for the transfer of landed property, and so forth. But Lord JoHx never condescends to such points as these. HRis reforms are all in the high constitutional region. They are for some supposed victim of civil or religious persecution. It is the Revolution of 1688 in a perpetually diminishing series. Lord JouN is always landing at Torbay to deliver an ideal Englishman from some hypothetical bondage. We are never to set about removing the nuisances that infest the whole country, and maldng some palpable, intelligible, and appreciated progress, because one of the family of deliverers wishes first to supplement the Bil of Rights or some Act of 1828 or 1832. Do it by all means, but do not let it always stop the way. That, however, is now the part Lord JOn1T RussELL is content to perform. Thus do "Old politicians chew on wisdom past, AAnd totter on in business to the last."
When people set off to Newington Butts, or to any other of the " Butts" with which every part of this kingdom is studded, they perhaps hardly give themselves the trouble to think what a significanl piece of history is contained in the universality of the designation. The simple fact is, that " the Butt-" meant the shooting-ground of the district. The shooting-ground was the place where every man who could bear arms went to practise with the long bow ; practice made perfect; and this perfection placed English archers in the firt rank of soldiers, and England in one of the first places among nations. But what course was taken when bows and arrows went out and muskets came in ? Until the last year or two no course at all. It seems to have been thought that the invention of gunpowder superseded personaf skill as well as personal strength, and enabled us to dispense with the art of shooting altogether. When bows were in use the utmost care was taken to provide every archer with the best possible weapon. Yew trees were planted and preserved for the sake of their wood, and bowstrings were manufactured as " round and sound" as skill could make them. In the ease of the musket all this care was given up. The instrument put into the soldier's hands was of the rudest pattern, and tho instruction pro- vidod was pretty neoirI- comprised in the directions to *Make reads' "Presen'"- atid " Fre." The resut corresponded with the preparation. Although the fire of the British infantry was conaidered more deadly than that of most armies, it is scarcely credible how many shots were thrown away. An Engineer offlcer who was present at one of the great battles of the last war, and who hadc an opportunity of observing the effect of musketrytp upO cavalry when charging a square, has stated that a volley delvered at 30 yards' distance only brought dowx thrwe men from their saddles. We believe the calculation used to be that one bullet in 250 carriedc death with it, and the estimate is probably not far from the truth. Not long ago a well-traiaed marksman was provided with an old regulation musket and placed 300 yards from a target 18 feet square. It was found that he could Rot put even into this spacious mark, one bullet out of 20, and even when the distance was dirninished by a third his shots were little more successful. The weapon thus tested was the regular weapon of the British soldier as late as the year 1842. At length, however, we have radically changed our whole systera-not so much in pursuance of any special discovery as by attentively adapting the means to the end at every stage of the process employed. We manufacture our ridles with great care, we apply the scientific theory of p.ojectiles to the manual exercise of the troops, and we assume throughout that the duty of a musketeer is not merely to discharge a musket, but to hit a mark. For the more effectual attainment of these purposes we have hot only established Government manufactories, but have also instituted a regular school, with all the forms and appliances of a wellorganized seminary. This establishment is situated at Hythe, and is termed " the School of Musketry," under which title its reports and proceedings appear very frequently in our columns, and in our last impression, indeed, -we gave an interesting description of the exoerimentg by which the still undeveloped capabilities of the musket have been tried. Nothing can be more striking than the revolution which has followed upon our new lights in these matters. The object is no less than the instruction of the whole British army in the use of what may be called a new weapon; for, though the improved musket is a musket still, it is handled in a totally different way. Without entering into technical details, which the reader perhapi would hardly care to follow, we may briefly state that the reforms introduced have been suggested principally by the observation of a projectile's course at various distanoes. The first thing, therefore, is to determine those distanoes, or, in other words, to train the soldier to Judge promptly and correctly by the eye of the distance at which he stands from any man or body of men. By his conclusions in this respect he regulates his aim, and then his well-constracted weapon does the rest. It is very remarkable that the latest devices in this system were anticipated by the intuitive genius of PEscorr, the Amerioan commander at the memorable engage. ment on Bunker's-hill. The directions he gave to his men were precisely those which are now given to the pupils at Rytne. He told them to watch till they could distinguish certain features in the advancing enemy, and then to take their aimi in a particular manner. How fatally these instructions answered the purpose was shown in the unexampled carnage of the day, while another incident related of the battle ik equally demonstrative of our own deficieneies. The American position was adjacent to some lofty trees, and when these were examined after the fight the branches were found riddled with shots in every direction, while the trunks were almost unscathed. Our troops had fired too high, and had wasted their bullets nearly as completely as if they had tired inm e ar. It is amusing to see how all the nomenclature of scholastic institutions is now carried into the discipline of the army. We have not only a " Shool" of Musketry, but a permanent staff of teachers-instructors of the first-class and instructors of the second-class-pupils similarly distributed, and even " inspectors" to see that the education communicated to a select few at Hythe is duly imparted to every regiment at its own station. The first fruits of this solicitude we found in the late war, but we do not know that we can convey a more distinct or popular notioZA of the effects of the new system than by stating, that on the same occasion when the old pattern musket was tried, as above mentioned, the new musket nised in the new manner was found to miss scarcely once. It is clear, therefore, that if a man c.an now hit every time, whereas he could formerly hit only once out of 20 times, the efficiency of the soldier, all other things being equal, is increased twenty-fold-the very result which we have been most desirous to bring about. Assuming, in fact, that every soldier can be equipped with such weapons as we yesterday described, and taught to use thera after the Hythe system, it is hard to see what force can hold. the field against infantry. The revolution is really little less considerable than that effected by the first discovery of gunpowder. Instead of one baU out of 100 taking effect at 30 yards, every ball will take effect at 30 times the distance, so that, unless similar improvements can be applied to cannon, artillery will be almost useless, as every gunner could to a certainty be kiUed at his piece. We have somewhere seen it conjectured that the establishment of universal peace might in the end be compassed by the perfection of war, and that human beings would cease to destroy each other when mutual destruction became a matter of certainty. The merits of such a speculation we shail not attempt to discuss, but, if so desirable a consummation should be ever likely to ensue, the new School of Musketry will certainly conduce to it as much as any invention of modern times.
Who shall say that Eastern nations are not rapidly advancing in civilization ? We shall certainly soon have to abandon our old commonplaces about Oriental immobility if we see many such documents as the account of the battle between the British and Persian troops given in the Teheran Gazette. St. Petersburg or Madrid could hardly have produced a more circumstantial piece of misrepresentation. That official journalism 'which devotes itself to the concealment of events has been evidently introduced into Persia with great promise of success; and we may easily guess the quarter from which it came. Frnus: KELNw in his speech at At'aens the other day talked about his great ancestors who invaded Greece in classic days. But in one respect the Persians have considerably advanced since those times. If XEXmES and ATOSSA had enjoyed modem advantages, they would, instead of wailing in chorus, have written an article describing the entire success of their expedition, and alleging the occupation of the conquered country as a reason why the army did not return. Pretty much in this style is the Persian narrative of ths late Battle of Koosnab. It will be remembered that the British force under Sir JA3is OuTn.&x and General STALKER left Bushire, marched 40 miles in little more than as many hours, was attacked faintly by the Persians during the night, took the offensive as soon as it was dawn, and by a Cavalry charge routed the enemy with a loss of some 800 men, our own casualties being comparatively few. This operation had to be explained for the satisfaction ef Perian pride,-a task, it would seem, somewhat difficult. Cerfainly, it night have been-enough.to proclaim in Oriental stle that the foreigners had been swept from the face of the earth before the innumerable host of the S ;r - but in accordanoe with the requirements of modem civilization it was determined to give the fictitious narrative a more sober dress. The Teheran version of the affair accordingly , that on the mach of the British troops the Persian commander, desirous to anticipate an attack, moved with 3,000 regular infantry, 300 cavalry, and 12 pieces of cannon to surprise our camp during the night. " The English," says the G"aen,d "retreated at the approach of our troops, " and sheltered themselves behind rocks and in " caverms." The English troops then hastened to reach Booraz-Jan before daylight. " SooJTA- oon-Moo=E pursued them with 3,000 picked "troops and eightpiecesof cannon." We,it appears, then burnt our amimunitionand retreatedtoBushire. In the meantime two other regimnents, with 400 cavalry and 10 gun", came to our assistance. A.fter tbis reinforcement the British troops turned round and the battle began. The Persians, though much inferior in number, fought for four hours and a-half without intermission. Twice they penetrated our ranks and broke them. Nothing, it appears, could have resisted such courage had it not been for the inclemency of the elements. The rain "fell with such force that " the two parties were obliged to separate." The English lost in the battle from 800 to 1,000 men; tho Persians from 300 to 600. When this veracious Oriental publication was "going to "1press " other details were momentarily expected. They came soon afterwards. A letter published in the Nord estimates our lows at 1,700 or 1,800 men, and the loBS of the Persians at not more than 300 or 400. We should hardly have thought it worth while to notice the efforts of this barbarian Court to put a good face on the terrible chastisement it has received, did thoy not afford an instance of how history is made for nations living under despotia Governments. This account of the Battle of Kooshab is evidently written for others besides the Persian public, if we may use the term. Who cannot detect in it an European style, and the shameless courage with which European officials misrepresent the most notorious oocurrences? Repression and mendacity go hand-in-hand, and where there is not the enjoyment of liberty there cannot exist the practice of truth. Throughout almost the whole of Europe the Governments permit .nothing to be published that is not favourable to their interest or to their seeming interest. In mflitary matters, especially, misrepresentation and falsehood have been consecrated by the example of the highest anithorities. The most decisive defeat is always a "movement "to the rear," or the zeal object of the contest is aid to have been gained, or the enemy to have been really beaten, and only enabled to keep his ground by a fortuitous combination of unforeseen circumstances. For years, for a whole lifetime, even in this inquiring and literary age, the real details of the most important battles remain the subject of contention on account of the imaginative bulletins of the commanders. The campaigns of the French revolutionary wars are only just being brorgit into the clear light of history. Mny facts of the war which has just been concluded will probably be known only after most who were concerned in it are in their graves. We have little doubt that the Persian version of this battle will be the historical version for a good half of Europe. For one especial reason the truth should be known of this Battle of Kooshab. It illustrated an important theory in the art of war. Poor Captain Noh.N, who was struck dead at Balaklava, wrote a work to prove that cavalry properly managed could act with irresistible effect against infantry. Kooshab gave a singular confirmation of his views. The Persian squares were shattered and dispersed by a well-directed charge of the Indian Regular Cavalry. So far the battle is of strategical importance; itwillbe a sort of "leading case" for the tactician. But we doubt much whether the knowledge of its details will extend beyond the limits of these islands. The fictitious narrative will do as well as the true one for the purposes of foreign writers and foreign readers. Judging from the versions of other battles which are still extant, we shall not be surprised if some twenty years hence there should be found in some continental history of Central Asia a vivid description of the English running into caves to avoid the victorious SooJrH-oomMoo;, burning their own ammunition in a paroxysm of fear, and leaving 1,800 kdlled and wounded behind them in their flight to Bushire. This would be as good history as much that we read at the present day.

CAVALRY AYND INPANTBY. TO THE EDITOR OP THE TIMES Sir,-No Englishman could have read the graphic ketch of the charge of the 3d Bombay Light Cavalry st the coobat of Kooshab, given in 217c Tima of the 14th inst., witbout feeling his blood stirred, and being proud of so brillant a feat of arms. The breaking and destruction of a well-formed squre of 500 infantry by some 240 DIagoons it one of those remrk. able events in military history which would seem to justify those theorists in favour of that one ara of the ervice who, like poor-Nolan, think cavalry can do everything. Let us examine and weigh thefacts, for it is of vlet importncq that no sniscalculation. should be made, based en what we think can be shown to be an exceptional succe, and such as is not likely to occur agaim This admission or presamption wl guard me agUAst any supicixon of seeking to, detct by one iota from the well-earned fame of the brae officers of the 3d Cavalry who led, or of the men who, followed them at Kechab, In any reflections I may offer to publio considertit. on that remarkable affair. I believe, and desire to inmulcate the principle, that the present is a period of trnsition in military scienee, and that this successful chage of the Bombay cavalry will, in al likelihood, be the last feat of the kind which milltay annals will havo to record. We are not told at what distanpe from the face of the Persian square Captain Forbes gave the word to chqo . we only know that that gallant leader and his two brother officers, " knee to knee and spurs in flank," roached the aerriod files (though not unathed) in a condition 3o throw their own weight and that of theirhorses on the bayonets, and that a breach was thus made, asnvewhat like that nadet by Arnold Winkelried at Morgarten, through which poure& "the dark troopers of the 3d, mad to avenge the death of poor Malet," their late beloved oolonel, who fell at Bushire, Then came the work of slaughter. Zvery one knows that a broken square offers about as much resitane as any other disorganized mass to horsemen who know the use of their arms, as the Bombay troopers evidently did. We must presume that the Persian infantry were armed with the flint-lock muskets, and that their fire would be almost harmless beyond 80 or 100 yards,-eharging distanoe is, I believe, generally rekoned to be 280 or 300 yards. The total loss of the cavalry in this charge was 17 killed and wounded (the exact number not certain) while it is said that not 20 of the Persians escaped. Now, it is not intended to assert that keeping infantry In line, as was done with effect at Balaklava, is the way in which cavalry attacks are to be in fatumreceived; but it must be calculated that the present armament of European infantry renders the success of a cavalry attack all but imposeible if that infantry is in square, and is only tolerably steady. Trained infantry can now give sA effective fire at 600 yards; so that, if the ground allowed it, any body of cavalry would suffer considerably before coming within charging distne, and few and far between would be those who would live to force thei} way through three ras of bayonets, as was done by the heroic band at Kooshb. It is much to be desired that more precise details of that event should be made pbElc,-at shat distauce, for instanoe, from the square the charging pa began, and how many saddles were emptied before the collision. The rifled musket and conical bullet and the training of the infantry soldier to a proper knowledge and use of the arm he bears willeffect changes in strategy which go far beyond our,present ken. The massing of men will have to undergo modifications when it is found that a single conical bullet will traverse tin hodiec of three or four file, which is affirmed by the Russians to have been the effect of the fire of the I:ards on their columns of attack at Inkermann; and though, as Napoleon said, success always attends "lIe gros bateitons," it will be a new problem, and one not yet solved, how to employ to the best advantage large bodies of infantry, silled in the use of a weapon which scatters death at the distance of an English mile. If this letter finds admission in your columns, the writer will venture to make a suggestion for defensive precautions, which he thinks the imnrovemrnt in A-- iunuen mispednsaoie. II.
THn LATE XMAoR-G=mLnL ?ATBIAS EVERAXDw C.B. D K.H.-Thisgallant and distinguished officer, who died on the 20th inst. at Southsea, commenced his britliant career as an ensign in the 2d or Queen's Royal Regiment in 1804; was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant in 1805; in February, 1807, he was selected to lead the forlorn hope at Montevideo, the party under his command on that occasion conssting of 32 non-commissioned officers and privates, of whom 22 were either killed or wounded. For this service he was promoted to a company in the 14th Regiment in April, 1807. For his gallant conduct on this memorable occasion he was presented with a sword by the Patriotic Fund at Lloyd's, and honoured with the presentation of thefreedom of thecityof Dublin. In1809, tbe2ndhattalion of thel4th was employed in the expeditionto Walcheren, and the siege of Flushing. On thel2th of August thetwo flank companies, one of which he commanded, supportedby the regiment, stormed one of the Dotch entrenchmenis, in co-operation with a detachment of the King's German Legion, carrying the entrenchments, capturing one gan and 13 prisoners, and establishing a lodgment within musket shot of the walls of the town, for which servioe the regiment was thanked in General Orders, and the flank companies in Divisional Orders; he also served daring the same year at the battle of Corunna. He comrnanded the 14th Regiment at the siege and capture of Hatras in Feb. ruary 1817; he also served in the Pindaree and JMahratta wars in 1817 and 1818, ane was promoted to the rank of Major in 1821. In 1826 he conmmanded the 14th Regiment at the siege and storming of Bhurtpore, for which service Lord Conmbermere stated in his putblic despatch, " I have the pleasure to acquaint your Lordship that the conduct of every one engaged was marked by a degree of zeal whicb calls for my unqualified approbation, but I mnst particularly remark the behaviour of His Majesty's 14th Regiment, commanded by Major Everard, and the 59th, commanded t y Major Fuller; these corps, having led tho columns of sssault, by their steadiness and determination decided the fate of the day." The Divisionil Order by Major-General Sir Thomas Reynell states, " Major-General ReyneiUcon. gratulates the troops of his divlsion-European and nativeengaged in the storming of Bhurtporethis morning upon the brilliant succes which attended their gallant exertions. It is impossible for him to convey half what he feels in appre. ciating the conduct of His Maiesty's 14th Regiment5 that led the pIncipal storming columns it hu imprewsed his mind with stronger noons of what a british regiment is capable of when led by such officers as Major Everard, Major Bishop, and Captain Mackenzie, than he ever before possessed. The Major-General requests that Maior Everard will assure the officers and soldiers of the 14th Regiment that they more than realised his expectaion" For this service he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant. Colonel on the 19th of January, 1826- he was made Colonel on the 23d of November, 184t, and iljor-General on the 11th of N,vember, 1851. Her Majesty was ggracsous pleased, on the recommendation of the late Field-Marshal Viscount Eiardinge, Commanding-in-Chief, tooonferon him 200. a-year as a rew ard for distinguished services. THX F. x Bolrcx E;PLOSroN .Ar WOLVERRAMPTOlr-Five persons have been kIlled by the boilerexplo. sion at Wolverhampton, noticed in 1ie li7ms of yesterday. Benjamin Mason, the proprietor of the fire-iron polishing machinery, to whom the boiler belonged, had always managed the engine, employing s his stoker a mam named Joseph Corntield. They were both kldled instantaeously, aud were frightfully mutilated Another workman was kIlled, and two children, upon whom a portion of the malthouse fell in the street. It is supposed that the explosion was occasioned by the sudden dmission of oold water into the boiler, parts of wbich had become redhot. An inqnpst has ieen commenced and adjounned before Mr. W. H. Phillip,. The deceased workmen were identified as Benjamin Mason, Joseph Cornfield, and Thomas Holdridge, The two children-Mathew William Turner, five years old, and lsaballa H1all-were identified by their parents. Evidence was also given that the boiler was a second-hand one when placed on the premises. The following is a smmatry of the cases that have been received into the South Staffrdshire Hospital in consequenco of the explosion. The oases reported as still " in a precarious state" are -James Anslow, aged 17, with a severe concuss on of the brain and contused and lacerated wound of scalp; Frederick Beloher, aged 16, severe concussdon of the brain, scalp tumour, and fracture '.f left leg; William Iill, aged 48, ight leg ampntated, simple fractnre of left leg, both arms burnt, and lacerated scalp wound; EdwinBradley, ed 26, a severecomponnd comminuted fracture of the skull, with aportion of the brain substance eecaping,auRv rious dsove-thbbdy. The five remaining patients, who are returned as " progres. ing satisfactorily" or " doing well,' and whose injuries re of a serious nature, are Samual Whitehouse, aed 45; his aon of the same name, aged 12; Joseph Fellows, agea5; Isaiah B-lcber. aged 20; and Thomas Bate, aged 20.

THE ROYAL ITALIAN OPERA. The ren et mario is slways an event in the operatI teason, andone to be dwelt upon with unmixed gra6cationL when he comes back in the full possession of his resouroes,. and rings- his verv best, as he did last night The opera selected for the occasion was Signor Verdi's Troewter,a groat fvounite with subeoribers, whatever may be its actual merits and demerits. It was only last &eason, after the departure of SignorTamberlik forXie Janeiro, that Mario essayed the character of Man1i.o for the first time. His sucoess was brilliant, as every z5bIu6 must remember; and since then he has nastered the musil and the dramatic situations in so complete a manner that the part now rauks justly among his most highly finisbed and effective impersonations. In the opening soenes othersingers may have eqnalIed, if not surpassed, him; but in the lost two acts blio- leaves all his competitors in the rear. This wa admitted from the beginning, and was fuly substanti. ated by his very fine performsnce on the prezent occasion. The cantlena aomsore, addressed to Leonora-"Ah! siben mio-one of the mostexpressive melodies of Verdi, wassung with exquisite tenderness, and a perfection of phrasing not to be exoelled. The fiery cabaltta -"Di qnelia pira i'orrendo foeo"-which Mantioo declaims previously to flying to the rescue of his supposed mother, Azucena,. though lss suited to Maro's peculiar idiosyncrasy, was delivered with a burst of genuine passion that nothing ould remi6t, and fully realized the emotions it was intended musically to portray. The slow movement was unanimously redemanded; bht the honour was rospectfullyp declined by the singer, who was reAlled at the desoent of the cuxtaim and loudly applauded. The last act was a series of successes for Mario, who, in the beautiful plaint from thetower-' 'Ah, chelamorteognora"with which the imprisoned Macrico responds to and accom ponies the "Miserere," chanted for his own salvation oould not possibly have exhibited more genial and h&tirt felt sentiment. The cncore that followed this was too general and emphatio to be resisted, and so the whole was gone through twice. Best of all, however, was per. haps the duet in the last scene, where the dootned troubadour, unoonscious of the desperate step to which Leonora has had recourse in order to preserve his own life, reproaches her with infidelity until the poison working it3 fatal end, the devoted lady dies ir her lover's arms. This was a masterpiece of histrionic effect, and the singing quite on a par with the acting. To single out all the fine points in the duet would be too long a task; but we may cite the panssionate vehemence with which the sentence, "IVa-tt abbomino, timaledico" (another fine passage iunigaorVerdi's very unequal opera) was uttered, as among the most striking of aIL Tbe whole of this duet, in which the efforts of Mario were powerfully supported by those of his admirable compasion, created the deepest sensation in the house. Of GrsisLeonora-which she attempted for the first time last winter at Drurt-lane Theatre, and in which she has since won the unanmmons suffrages of the Parisian public-we have spoken so rcently that it is unnecessay now to criticise it in detail. Notwithstanding certain mrodiflortions which the music has to undergo in order to bring it within the means of the vocalist, it loses little or nothing of what is conventionally termed "eÂ£eet" at the hands of thiswonderfully-oifted and energetio artist; on the contray, it gains in vanous instances, while the poetical eonception andrealization of the character throughout are such as no previons representative has been able to reach. The whole of the tower scene was profoundly moving and pathetic; while the last duet, in the course of which occurs the death of Leonora, who has swallowed poison to save the life of her betrothed husbana and her own honour, involved a demonstration of histrionic power which eould only be expected from an aetress so consummate and experienod in all the artifices of the stage. Grisi huA eertaWy added another sucoessful part toher repertory. Madame Nantier Didi6e is one of the beet AzuOenas we have seen, although she can boast neither the dramatic intensity of Madame Viardot Garcia, nor the faleltlen vo. calization of Alboni. She has caught, nevertheless, ome. thing from both of those gteat artists, which, combined with a marked individuality of her owrn, and that com. mendable carefulness which, in all Madame Didi6aes pe. formanoes, affords such peculiar satisfaction to. eon. noisseurs, produces a result both effective and agreeahbl. Her singing last night was everywhere excel lent, the great scene in which the -iPg relates her history to Manrico being by no means Ie leat effective incident. Signor Graziani's chief display, as the Contc dl Luna, ia in the popular aria (so dear to amateure of the cornet-a-pistons), "I1 balen del su Norriso," which he %-. ,ways sings admirably, and never sang to geter prtctio, than last night.

'HE SPBRAKEBRSIp OF TEB HOUME OF COMMONS. The office of Speaker, although not coeval with the House in which he presides, is of ancient date. The fist instance of a member being chosen by the Commons to preservo order, maintain forms, and act as their mouth-piece (hence denominated " Speaker") was in the year1377(1st of Richard II.), and the member seiected was Peter De la Mare, who ba4 been imprisoned in the preceding reign for the freedom of his remarks upon the Court, a fact imdieating the growth of a spirit of independence in that assembly. Under the Tudors and Stuarts the Speaker of the Coxmmons, the choice of whom was -always subject to the Sovereign's approval, was a creature of the Court, and was expected to attend, when summoned, upon the Prince, whose aessages, and even commands, he conveyed to the House. In the reign of Charles L, long before the "4 troubles," a member of the House of Commons (Sir John Elliott) was stopped in the midst of his epeech, when apparently about to animadvert upon one of the Ministers, by the Speaker, who " with tears in his eyes," said, " There is a command laid upon me to interrupt any that go about to lay an aspersion on the Ministers of State ;" and Sir John sat down. On the memorable 2d of Marob, 1629, when the same member proposed a remonstrance against levying tonnage and poundage without the consent of Parliament, which he read himself (both the Clerk and the Speaker refusing to read it), the Speaker (Sir John Finch) declined to put the question, having been, he said, otherwise commanded by the King, and 1' to put no question but to adjourn." This was too much for the .temper of the House. The Speaker, beseehing the members "to let him go," was forcibly held in the chair uutil the question was put by a member and carried by acclamation. The " forbidding the Speaker to put a question" was one of the "grievances to be redressed" -enumerated by Pym In the Long Parliament, in 1640. The full effect of the Royal veto upon the election of Speaker is, perhaps, stiU undefined. Sir Edward Coke, who himself fi}led the office, told Queea Elizabeth that the choice of the House went for nothing unless she allowed it. In the reign of Charles IL this question distinctly arose, but its decision was evaded by a compromise under the following circumstances. At the meeting of Parliament in 1679 the King desired that the choice of Speaker should fall upon Sir Thomas Meres, but the House voted Mr. Seymour, the Speaker in the preceding Parliament, into the chair. When SnYMour was presented for approval the King rejected him. The Commons maintained that the Royal approval was a mere form, and that the King could not reject a Speaker chosen by the House without reason assigned. it was answered that, since the King had the power of rejecting, he might keep the reason to himself. To end the dispute, both candidates were set aside, and a lawyer named Gregory was chosen by the Rouse and approved bY the King. " It has ever since been understood," says Hume, " that the choice of Speaker lies in the Rouse, but that the King retains the power of rejecting any person disagreeable to him." After the Revolution the Speackers, in avoiding the fawning sycophancy towards the Crown which disgraced some of their predecessors, seem to have run into the opposite extreme according to Swift. who, speaking of Harley (afterwards Earl of Oxford), chooen Speaker in three successive Parliament*, says that " he was the first of late years who ventured to restore the forgotten custom of treating hia Prince with duty and respect." Among the many personages distinguished by probity as well as talents who have filled this exalted post there was an exception in a man of rank, stigmatized by one historian as " a hireding proatituto," by another as " bold, adroit, and corrupt," by whom It was disgraced. This was Sir John Trevor, who in the reign of William III. (1695) was declared by , resolution of the House guilty of taking a bribe of 1,000 guineas on passing a certain Bil, for which he was degraded from the chair and expelled the louse, having to endure the humiliation of putting the question of his own guilt. This was at a period, it must be remembered, when, as Johnson observes, "the contagion of avarice tainted every mind," rand even Ministers of State dabbled in corruption. A Chancellor of the Exchequer (Aislabie) was expeled the House and sent to the Tower for his connexion with the South Sea bubble. Mr. Arthur Onslow was a Speaker of great reputation in the reigns of the first two Georges, having been chosen in five successive Parliaments, from 1727 to 1761, when age aud infirmity compelled him to retire. The concurrent testimony of contemporaries represents him as a man of extensive knowledge, great eloquence, and unspotted integrity. Although said to have been elected in the first instance through Sir Robert Walpole's influence, he maintained a stanch independence. Like Prior, however, he is reported to have been fond of humble Society, and to have sought relaxation in the kitchen -of a low publichouse. Anotber remarkable Speaker was Sir Fletcher Norton (afterwards Lord Grantley), elected ia 1770, who was long remembered for his brusque manners and coarse language. He filled the chair during the exciting debates on Wilkes's expulsion, and we are told by Junius that Sir Fletcher, "w ith 9lis usual prostituted effrontery," assured the House that "he should regard one of their votes no more than a resolution of so many drunken porters." In 1780, when the House was in committee, an unseemly personal altercation took place between him and Lord North. A new Parliament meeting that year, Sir Fletcher declined re-election, alleging that " the very great and inocreased duties of the office had impaired his constitution materially, and he feared had weakened hbis intellecti ;" but he accused the Government of neglecting him, observing that " if anything could induce him to aspire to the chair it would be the -contempt with which he had been treated." Having been nominateds however, his competitor, Mr. Cornwall, was elected by 203 votes against 134. "'Sir Fletcher was subjected to the further mortifica- tion of having a vote of thanks to him for his past services resisted on the ground, chiefly, of an " illtimed and imprope"' speech he hadcaddressed to the Throne. Speaker Cornwall died during the session of Parliament in January, 1789, and Mr. (afterwards Lord) Grenville was chosen to suceed him, in opposition to Sir Gilbert ElUiot, by 215 to 144. Upon this occasion it became a question whether, when the election of a Speaker took place in the middle of a Parliament, it was necessary that he should be presented for the Royal approbation. The new Speaker suggesting that at the Restoration, and also at the Revolution, this was not done, these precedents were followed, and Mr. Grenville was not presented; although, if the approval be more than a mere form, the reason of the omission is not apparent. In June, 1789, the chair was vacated by Mr. Grenville's appointment to be one of the Secretaries of State, and Mr. Addington (better known as Viscount Sidmouth) was selected to suceeed bim, bia competitor being also Sir Gilbert Elliot, and the votes beiDg nearly the same as in the preceding election,-namely, 215 to 142. In the following year a Bill was passed to augment the Speaker's allowance, which had fluctuated,being upon an average under 3,0001.-to 6,0001. a- year, its prevent amount. It appears that forner Speakers held other offiles conjointly wiMth the Speakership. Sir Spencer Compton (afterwards Lord Wilmington), Speaker in the reign of George I., was at the same time Paymaster of the Army, and Mr. Onslow was Treasurer of the Navy. In the catq of the latter, a warm discussion having arisen upon a question in which the Qiovernment were intereated, and which waÂ§ decided in their favour by the casting vote of the Speaker, the fact of his holding a Governtdent appointment during pleasure was cast in his teeth, and next day he threw up the Treasurership. The " prostitute" Sir John Trevor held, while Speaker, the Mastership of the Rolls, and, strange to say, he retained that high judicial office many years after his expulsion from the House of Commons with the brand of corruption upon him. Mr. Addington filled the post of Speaker for 12 years, until 1801, and his " flowing civility and apt ability" in the chair have not faded altogether from the memory of living witnesses. There was more gentleness and courtesy than dignity in his manners, and some of his biographers represent his qualifications for the office as few and meagre. Greater attention was then paid to costume in both Houses of Parliament than at the present day, and the writer of this paper remembers how much the gravity of the Speaker's aspect was enhanced by the full-bottomed peruke, properly so called, worn by Mr. Addington, which descended in massive curls of real human hair, loaded with powder, to his waist. When Mr. Addington exchanged the post of Speaker for that of First Lord of the Treasury his successor was Sir John Mittord (soon after created Lord Redesdale), then Attorney-General, who held it only for a few months, being appointed (it is said against his own wish) Lord Chancellor of Ireland in February, 1802, when he was succeeded by Mr. Abbot (afterwrards. Lord Colchester), who held the office for more- than 15 years. Mr. Abbot had been previously ditinguished by great diligence, as a member of Parliament, in originating inquiries into expired and expiring laws, the state of the public records, &c. He was a little, bustling man, somewhat dictatorial in his tone and manner, impairing perhaps, rather than upholding, the dignity of the office, of which he was tenacious, by a magisterial air and occasional rebukes administered to members who violated the strict letter of the rules, some of which his predecessors had suffered to faU into desuetude. For example, when Bills or papers are presented it is the rule that the presenter should appear at the bar of the House, but it had become usual to stop half-way. Mr. Abbot, however, exacted the performance of the entire journey. The writer well remembers Sir William Curtis endeavouring to spare his huge bulk this additional toil, whea he was thus addressed by the chair:-" The hon. member must go to the bar. How often am I to tell hon. members that if they have anything to present they must go to the bar 7' Such a reproof would not be tolerated at the present day. It must be confessed that during his Speakership, when party feeling ran into excess, and first-rate orators often swayed the passions of the House, it was no easy task to sustain the authority of the Chair. The investigation into the conduct of the Duke of York, the impeachment of Lord Melville, the committal of Sir Francis Burdett, and the Inquiry into the disastrous Walcheren Expedition gave rise to warm aud sometimes acrimonious debates, which called for the frequent interposition of the Chair. Members frequently rebelled against the sternness of the Speaker's discipline, who would not permit his decisions to be questioned. "When the Chair has pronounced its opinion," he would say, "there is an end of the matter." U3pon one occasion he was taxed by Mr. Tierney with partiality, and the charge was regularly discussed upon a motion, but the House passed a resolution ap proving the Speaker's conduct. Mr.Whitbread's motion, in April, 1805, for a vote of censure upon Lord Melville, founded upon the celebrated Tenth Report, was carried by the casting vote of the Speaker (the numbers being 216 on each side), who thereby gained vast temporary popularity. A caricature published at the time,when caricatures were considered safer vehicles of public opinion than newspapers,-represented mr. Fox standing upon the floor of the House of Commons, and exclaiming with an oath,-" An Abbot I why he shall be a Pope I" Mr. Abbot took a more decided part in political questions than is now considered compatible with the essential attribute of a Speaker-rigid impartiality. He spoke often, and sometimes at much length, in committees. In 1814 Lora Morpeth brought forward a motion implying a censure upon Mr. Abbot, founded upon a speech made by him to the Prince Regent at the close of the preceding session with reference to the Roman Catholic claims (of which he was an ardent opponent), wherein he had iused the following words, which, it must be acknowledged, savour strongly of partisanship :-" Adhering to those laws by which the Throne, the Parliament, anc the Government of this country are made fundamentally Protestant, we have not consented to allow that those who acknowledge a foreign jurisdiction should be authorjized to administer the powers and jurisdiction of this realm." Among the supporters of the motion (which was negatived) was Mr. C. W. Wynn, who pronounced this passage of the address " highly reprehensible." The most intractable element in the House during the greater part of Mr. Abbot's reign was the notorious Mr. John Fuler-Jack Fuller,;as he loved to call himself-the member for Sussex, whose extravagances, especiaUly when he visited the House after dinner, were an opprobrium to it. Fullerwas a large, bulky man-Mr. Wilberforce describes his person accurately as " coarse and ponderous"!-and, although often vaxunting his family, he affected the nan of low life, and was what he affected. A pri. vate friend of Mr. Abbot, he treated him In his official capacity with contempt. All efforts to restrain his vulgar insolence by cries of "Order" were futile. He defied the House, bullying the members, whom he upbraided with being afraid of " the little fellow in the big wig." His speeches abounded in personalities, and were not unfrequently garnished with oaths. " Those who don't like England," he once said, " d- 'em, let 'em leavo it." Being called to order, he denied that there was anything disorderly in the sentiment, whieh he said he had heard given as a toast. The career of this "barbarian," as he was properly termed, reached its climax, when an occur- rence took place to which, perhaps, no American House of Assembly could furnish a parallel On the 27th of February, 1810, while the Rouge was in committee hearing evidence touching the expedition to the Scheldt, Fuller entered inebriated, kick-ed about a chair placed for Lord Chatham, assailed the Chairman with brutal oaths, and produced the utmost confusisn. The Chairman was ordered to report his oonduct (the motion being made by the Speaker), and when the House resumed he was ordered into custody. But he resisted and broke from the Serjeant, who was obliged to summon the messengers to his aid, and the disturber was at length removed by main force. Mr. Wilberforce, in one of his letters, compares him to a mad bulL " Never surely such a scene in the House of Commons," is the entry in his Diary. A motion made for his release was negatived; but upon a subsequent day he was brought to tk bar, and reprimaaued there in the Speakee* most caustic terms. - NYben committed to, . v&toay whicol ought to have been oblgatory upon your person and your hono0'ur;' he obse~r'v "s you forcibly broke from that restraint, and.,entered e,waiall lwith clamour and. ovttra unparaL;ed.O" OM thiL disgraceful scene a very mubVdued and mitigated description is, perhaps discreetly, given by Hansard. During his, tenure of offloe Mr. Abbot introduced many inprovements ia the business of the House, -such as the institution of a private Bill department, and the regulation of the mode of printing the vots. He excelled in those short, set speeches in which the Speaker gives utterance to the thankas or censures of the flouse; they are still regarded as models, and a collection of them haa been privately printed. Mr. Abbot relinquished the Speakership in By; 1817, on account of illhe!ith, and MIr. Chades Banners Sutton (subsequently Viscount Canterbury) was chosen to succeed hm, in preferenoe to Mr. C. W. Wynn,bi 31 votes- to 150. To Mr. Abbot's diligence andrassiduity in the details of the office Mr. Sutton added advantages, natural and acquired, to which the former could not lay claim. IHis figure. was tall and commnding; his voice was deep and clear; his deportment, though, perhaps, too stately, combined (in the language of one of his eulogists) " dgity without pedantry, and courtesy without servility." When decorated with the Order of the -Bath, the insignia of which he alwys wore in the chair, he seemed to embody, in the popular apprehension, the abatract notion of a Speaker. lHis oratorical talents were slender, but his official speeches were always characterized by good taste, and his censure; when saverity was demanded, were keen and trenchant. He maintained the decorum of debates by suavity rathor than authority. When the artillery of temper seemed ready to play.he often checked it by slowly rising, a deprecatory smile playing upon his features. His reign of 18 yeas, long as it was, ended prematurely. At the meeting of the new Parliament, under Sir Robert Peel's short-lived Administration, in 1835, Sir. Charles Sutton was nominated for the Speakership by the Government, but his re-election was opposed on the ground that he had been busied in subverting the. Melbourne Ministry. Ee defended himself against this charge; but Mr. Abercromby, proposed by the Opposition, was chosen by 316 to 306. The Speakership, it was understood, had beenthe cherished object of Mr. Abercromby's ambition; but when he attained it he displayed no special qualifications for the post. In external qualities he ranked below his predecemor, and he was apt to be impatient, captious, and irritable. Mr. Hume more than once annoyed and disconcerted him by dispulting the correctness of his decisions. The state of his health might be pleaded in extenuation of these defects, for he soon found the duties of this arduous office beyond his strength, and in May, 1839, he resigned it, assigning ill health and fatigue as the reason; and he was called to the House of Peers by the title of Lord Dunfermiine. Mr. Charles Shaw Lefevre (now Lord Eversley) was chosen to replace him, in opposition to Mr. Goulburn, by 317 to 299, and he retained the post with the unanimous consent of the louse until his voluntary retirement at the close of the last Parliament. It would be difficult for the severest critio to suggest any qualification for this important office in which Lord Eversley was deficielnt. On a par with Lord Canterbury in the natural advantages of person and voice, he was easier and more graeeful in his deportment, and, while his unvarying blandness and courtesy conciliated individual members, his familiarity with all matters connected with the business and forms of the Rouse, and his mild yet firm exercise of authority, won univeral deference and respect. The change which has taken place in the form of aaarew zaopa t'y opunkua whAn pwM.vti ii_ selves, after election, for the approbation of the Sovereign is worthy of notice. Up to Mr. Abbot's time the Speaker elect, when announcing the choice of the Commons, professed his utter incompetency, and prayed that they might be " commanded" to proceed to & new election. This form was at first followed by Mr. Abbot, but in his later addres he merely asked that the House might be "alUowed to rescind their choice, and elect another person. Mr. Manners Satton went a step further, saying that, " if it be the pleasure of the Prince Regent to disapprove the choice the House of Commons could have no difficulty in selecting a better qualfied person." Mr. Abercromby " humbly sub. mitted himself to His Majesty's Royal will and pleasure," a form adopted by his succesor, the late Speaker. In former days this specious modesty was sometimes carried to an absurd length. There is upon record a disqualifying address of Sueaker,Yelverton to Elizabeth, in which he descends to minute par ticulars. "1 My estate," said he, " is nothir-erspondent for the maintenance of this dignitybi for my father, dying, left me a younger brother, ant, nothing to me but my bare annuity. Then, growing to man's estate, and some small practice of the law, I took a wife, by whom I have had many children, the keeping of us all being a great impoverishing to my estate, and the daily living of us all nothing but my daily industry. Neither from my person nor my nature doth this choice arise; for he that supplieth this p1ac4 ought to be a man big and comely, stately andw4l-spoken, his voicegreat, his carriage majestical, hi? iaturo haughty, and his purse plentiful and heave y but, contrarily, the stature of my body is auhl, myself not so wellspoken, my voice loF, my can9age lawyer-like and of the common fashiou, my nature soft and baihfil, my purse thin, light, and never yet plentiful." He omitted one qualification which is indispensable at the present day-namely, a robust constitution, capable of bearing the severe tix which the labolur of his office now impo upon a Speaker of the House of Commons.

I prefer to take this occasion to look back with satisfaction and gratitude to what is pa and to look forward with hope to what is to come. For the last 30 years, beginning In 1828, we have been making great changes in our laws, altering the bais of, our Parliamentary represtation, admitting millions of our f0llow-subjects to the benesfits of religious equalht, enl4rging our commerial libertles, 6xtendingthe privileges of personal freedom to men of every race and every colour, in whatever cld!e they ould be reachedlby ihe beneficent sceptre of 'he British monarchy. " While we have been achievlg these tasks Conservative predictions of the moat glo6my nature have assailed us in our onward path-the fall of the Crown and the House of Lords-the destruction of the established church-hopeleas anarchy in the West Indies-the entire rauin of the agrioulture of the united kingdom. Such have beeoi a few of the ominous cries which have atunned the eas of the British peoplewvhile engaged in their difficult and toilsome mrh. affection between the inhabitants of the different parts of the united kdngdom have been ctrengthened, loyalty to the Thrbne has bec?ome a warmer and more constant ilame, intemnal peace has been preserved and secre, agricuture has improved, commerce and manufactnres have prodgiously increased, and the prophets of evil themselves can only wonder at the material prosperity of our country and the confilrmed sability of our institutions. " May e not hope, then, gentlemen, that by following the sarae policy, by uniting progress with order and im. provementiith wisdom, we may attain still further and greater benefits? The opinion of the good, says Milton, Is knowledge in the making. By consulting the opinion of the good and the enlightened the House of Commons recently elected may find means to promote education, to extend political franchises, to enlarge the boundaries of religious frcedom by removing some remaining dis. abilities, and to relieve the people of some of their vexatious burdens. "I shall have every reason to be grateful and contented if I am permitted by my votes in Parliament to contribate to such happy results. "Castle-hill, April 20."
CHIHBSE RMIGRATION. TO TEH EDITOR OF TEIE TIMES. Sir,-Mr. Lamont's letter on Chinese emigration to the West Indies, inserted in Th7e Time-s of the 22d inst., gives a very powerful confirmation of the statements you have permitted me to make throulgh your columns as to the frightful condition of the majority of the coolie labourers in the Island of Cuba. The advices from Havarnah to the 8th of March indicate further arrivals of Chinese in addition to another cargo of 600 slaves from Africa during the previous fortnight. The three cargoes of Chinamen report deaths on the voyage as follows:- One Dutch vessel having 10 deaths. ,,Dutch n, , 1 , ,, Americit ,, ,, 290 ,, The two former show that deaths are not neoessarily numerous. The latter instauce, the Cora, a New York vesselsailingunder Peruvian colours, exhibits the treffio again.in its worst features. Ana American stock company, which has imported 7,600 Chinese, reports of known deaths on tho passage 1,197. * The case of the British ship Duke of Portland is now before the public in tho pages of the Parliamentary Report just publishod. It is painful to read in the evidence giVen by the captain and the surgeon such facts as the following: -That the suicides commenced on the third day after sailing from China; that they continued at the average rate of three suicides daily, until after the ship bad passed the Straits of Sunda; that within a week after sailing as many as 60 cases of typhoid fever had appeared among the emigrants, and that the disease increased in malignity until the conclusion ef the voyage; that the captain believed that at least one third of the emigrants had been kidnapped; that they were in a condition of mutiny, as might be expected, throughout the voyage; that the ship's crew were armed, the captain never lay down without his cutlass, and usually as many as from 12 to 18 of the coolies were in irons; that there were half as many again of emigrants on board as the vessel was calculated to cAry; and that the fruit of it was a mortality of 128 out of 382 Chinese passengers. For such a state of things some remedy may be anticipated, is far as British ships are concerned, from the iastructions .which have been sent from the Colonial-office to Sir John Bowriog.. Mr. Lamont's referenoe to the condition of the coolies in the British West Indian possesions and in the transport thither hba been anticipated by my letter in Thie Times of the 3d of April. On again reading my first letter upon the subject he will find it contains no illibera! or vague Ininduation, but a direct undisguised inquiry, which I am thankful to Dave as directly answrered. I remain. Sir. ronr veryr ni A.,dt c.-,,.. TEIOMAS E. GLADST6NE.

Sttff-AMtant. Surgeon X. A. Turner, Staff-A asltant-Surgeon J. Goodwin, Staff-Asdstant-Surgeon Washington Patton, and StaffAsxssant-Surgeon W. Barry. Yesterday morning a discharge of troops took place from Chatham, to- the number of 104 non.commluloned officers and men, selected from the 7th Dragoonx, 9bh Lancers, 10th Huuars, 12th itanoer, lstRoyals, 2d Royals, 7th Fusileers, 10th and 13th X3gh nttn , 20tb-an8 218t Puileers, 22d and 24 Welsh Fuslleers, 26th Camerouan,, 30th, 49th, and 51st LightInfantry, 53d, 55th, 56th, and 60th Rifles, 65th and 72d Highlanders, Sat., 86th, and 88th Connaught Rangers, 94th, 95th, and 98th, and theRifle Brigade. The Scout, Coastgard cutter, Mr. Leaman, Commander, arrived at Sheerness at 10 a.ru. yesterday, having on board Michael Hawkings, ordinary mariner, being the only survivor of the crew of the Curlew, CoatguArd cutter, Mr. William Shepherd, late second mate in oommand. it appears that the Curlew and Scout anchored on the previous rgeoanroes^OrustO-ne Xous3igbtveei9 distnt from the CurLe.S ab6ut half a nib, the light-vesel bearing north-west, and the Scout was it anchor about a quarter of a mile from the Curlew. Michael Hawkings relieved the, lookout-man on the deck of the Curlew at 12 o'clock. At aboiLt 1 .m. Hawkings perceived at a short distance a large steamveesel coming right on for the Curlew. He immediately ran to the companion, and called out for all hands to come on. deck as quickly as pos. sible-that there was a large steamer steering direct itpon the Carlow. He then ran aft, stepped up on the tafrail of the Curlew, and called out as loudly as he could, but in a few seconds the steamvessel came stem on to the Curlew, strilking her txfrall right in midships, and breaking the main boom. Hawkings jumped up, and caught hold of the bobstay of the steamvessel. He then heard some person on boardthe steamvessel say, "Why didyounot show alightP and the samo person said immediately " Stop her 1" Hawklngs heard no more, he found himself under water, aud shortly after on recovering himself he found he had hold of the rigging at the mast-head of the Curlew. He was entangled in the standing and running rigging of the Curlew's topmast, the topmast being carried away. He then clearly saw thel steamvessel lower a boat, the boat was manned, but he positively states that all the boat's crew lay on their oars after leaving the steamvessel, and that they drifted from him with the wind and tide, and never once pulled towards him. In about half-an-hour after wards he was taken off the rigging by the boat's crew of the Scout in a very exhausted state from having been under water some time and bruised by the stesmvessel running over him. The crew of the Scout Identified the steamvearel as being the Baron Osy, of Antwerp, from Antwerp, bound for London. The Scout's boat remained about the mast of the Curlew for some hours to recover the broken spars and rigging, -also hoping that some of the bodies might rise to the surface. At the time the Cerlew was run down it was rather dark, but not densely dark. The persons drpowned are Mtr. William Shepherd, second mate in command; Alexander Twinney, mariner; Henry White, gunner; William Redding, mariner; Edward Whito, mariner; Wiliam Weeller, ordinay mariner; and Joseph Mathews,flrst-class boy. Onthe sdaffair being mnadeknown to the port authorities by Inspecting-Commander William C. Fors7th, R..N., immediate arrangements 'were made for the steamvessels Lizard, lieutenant Thomas B. christopher, and the African, Rhueben Harvey, to take on board an efficient number of riggers. &c., with weighing gear, and proceed dowrn to the Curlew. Both steamvesels left Sheerness between 1 and 2 o'clock, the riggers being under charge of Mr. John Jackson, the Ansiant-Master-Attendant of the yard. Captain Forsyth also prooeeded to she spot to render such assistance with his men 'or the natu of thecaserequired. Daringthenightthewind veered from west north-west to west, from that to north-east, and at times to the esatward. There is no doubt that in two or three tides the Curlew will be got in on the ebb dryor the Mouse, or, if practicable, towed to Sheerness between the two steamveasels sent out to raise her. The Avon, 3 guns, paddlewOeal steam'vessel, tender to flagsbip at Devonport, arrived at Sheerness yesterday at noon from Devonport and Portsmouth with supernmeraries and seamen for the Cumberland, Captan John B. Diabkso. The Cumberland i setting up her lower rigging and has sent up topmn ts; she ii s progressing rapidy in hereqaipment. The Ginffe seamvessel, B. .

Sir,-In you-leading artlo of the 21st inst. you erprmw some doubts as to "w whether General Aahburnam issxactly the pian for taing xudden pyeseion of Canton, marching on Peldn," Ic. In those misgivings I mot heartily. coincide, and you shall judge from hens lttei episode ia the General's rvioes whether I have not& good reason for so doing. I have now In my possesson a little memorandum-bb64 in which I wrot dowm a few noteson the campaign of tbi Sutisi in 1845-46, jotted down immediately after' the lst. action, Sobraon. From these, tuistod by the most vivid recollection of what occurred in my oognizanoe, I give yont the fMllowing details:- That you may understand what I have to say, I mvtt premise that our chief advanced post at Rhodawallah-s about a mile from the left front of ournmp, and about 200 yards from the nearest point of the -ikh -intrentchments _ tht at someS00tK&from R daw*1 ,WAer i -f t)ihortegtllne to those intrencbmnnt, wa su aikh outpost ptmeod the Maichan (look-out stage). In the immediate neighbourhood of thi post it had been decided by the Commander-in.Chiefj Governor-General, and heads of departments, in council asembled, that our batterv of heav artiUerywas to be thrown up, destined to sbdue the firstof that portion of the Sikh intrenchrment upon which oar nain attack was to be made. Bdgadier Ashburnhamws in oommand of the outpost ef Rhodawallah on the 9th and 10th of February, 1846, having under his orders Her Majesy's9th, two nativ re nernts, and a detail of artillery. At 11 p.m. of the 9th 1, then. holding the podition of a staff offioer, started from. camp by order of the brigadier commading the artiUery to inforna Brigadier Ashburnhamu that the first gun of the siege train. bad got under way, and to desire him to lose no time. i taking the Sikh outpoet at the Maichan, agreeably to the orderm of the Commander-1n-Chief. Arrived at histent, I found the Brigadier in his dressing-gown. I communicated to him the message I was charged with. He replied that his orders wreo to take the Mkichan with Her Majesty's 62d. it 4 o'clock am.

Myreesoning was of no avail; the 62d, at 4 a.m., was his ultimatum I returned to camp. My brigadier, his second in commnan (f the same rank, and the two brigadiers of the Engineers, disgusted at the state of affairs-a boggle in liminc-proceeded to Rhodawallah to endeavour to persuade Brigadier Ashburnham of the necessity of taking the post at once. I sacompanied them. They were not a whit more sucessfal thin I had been. He was obdurate. The whole of the offioers and men attached to the Heavt Artillery and Engineers remained from, say, 12 o'lock till 4 a.m. " kicking their heels" in the most bitter cold night, without oovering or fire, instead of throwing up their bhattery, as was intended by the Commander-in-Chief. By this time Sir H. Gough, Commander-in-Chief, bedight in a white blanket palett over his uniform, Sir H. Hardinge in his earriage, and their " brilliant" staffs congregated at Rhodawalla.

Dr. Kern'a political bggage is light, but I fear his heart is heavy. The arngement is far from being like what, In the buoyaney of his first hopes and the certitude of his own powersof persuasion and generaldiplomaticakill) he had promised the Swiss PMrusia has, as I lMve already observed, reduced her terms so far aa the money is concerned; slhe now accepts, and Dr. Kern engageefor Switzerland to pay,1,00,,OOOf. byway of indemnity; the King ofPraiareta th title of "Prinoe of Neubel"dSwitzerland will give him a guarantee respecting the proper administration of charitable institutions in NeuchAtel. There are other conditions, but those I mention are, I believe, the most important; the Representatives of the: four Powers adopted them as the basis of an arrangement on the 1st of April (abs't omen I), and the time has since been taken up with the diffionltioj incidental to putting the protocol or oonvention into form. We may be certain that a solution which gives an indirect right to the King of Prussia to intervene in the internalaffairs of the canton,under the pretext of sleeing the guaatee properly exe-- cuted, and the continuanlce of the title of " Prince of Neuchatel," will be very badlyreceived in Switzerland. The Swisst will not believe that the King and the Royaliat party do not still meditate the separation from the Federation of that canton, or that they will not carry it into execution on the first favourable opportunity. If the Federal Council, which is divided into two nlearly equal parties, accpts the arrangement, it will be- 'with the greateat repug. ance. Many people here doubt the acceptance but what can Switzerland do alone aqainat Europe? As to great and general dimsatisfaction among the -masa there is no doubt. Dr. Kern, supposing nothing extraordinary occurs, will be bac about the end of the month to sign the convention. A private letter from Bucharest of the 11th inst, says : "The laboura of our Commissioners have not yet qomnmenoed. The French Commissioner soon leaves for J. His departre wan to havo taken place earlier, but has been put off by unavoidable circumstances. People say, aaI have already informnedayou1 that the object of his journey is to watch the conduct of the Raimakan of Moldavia, The gUp.anCommnnssioner ha at las arrived, and has received an ovation from the clergy. M. Basily is quite astonished at the sumptuousnnr displayed at bis installation. ' The Vistaria has, then, he*ps of money,' he. sa.id on witness ing all this luxury. He han sent away the carriages placed at his disposal, aud has givein orders for a very modest style of living until the aivalof his cook. This uan, pretending conduct, which controats so muclh with that of the others, has produoed a strong and favourable impre. sion, but it has had no imitators among his colleagues, who eontinue to enjoy all the advantage of their situation, and whose rule seems to bo to take the goods the gods provide them.' The Commissioners appear astouised at the luxury which they find among us, and indeed It .is extraordinary, ern and western at the same time. They are partica. lnkrstruokwith thatdisplayed by the Boyard Otetelechano, who gives magnifioent dinners and suppers amd dramatic representations at his mansion. The Commissioners, however, are not ignorant of the origin of the Wallachian Tarcaet's wealth. These fortunate gentlemen are literally overwhelmed with dinners, and theonly drawback is the confusion thatoccursas to precedence in taking places, but each person tries to manage as best he may. One of the sons-in-law of the Hospodar Stirbey gave a dinner to the French Commis. sioner before inviting the Turkish functionary. This ap. peared strange, but people say it waz out of consideration for the Consul-General of France, M. Bolard, to whom the SZid en-in-law was under some private obligations. A clever otriuer, Dr. Asald, a great enemy of Bibesco, a friend of Stirbey, and formerly the Secretay of the Ghikas, is giving himself much trouble to ingratiato himself with the French Comamisioner. " A M. Lyaocke, who gives himnsel the title of Count though every one knows he is of a halt Gipsy origin, has oommenced a series of receptions, and the French CommisEioner dances at them raost joyously. The party of tha brthers, intimate enemdes, Stirbey and Bibesco, are in con. utant movement, and cover the PrincIpalities with emisaries. These emiSies hold everywhere the same language X the r population-narnelythat thaEuropeanCommi; alonera have oome for the DurDose of deDrivion them of the documents proving thAt they are proprlietors, and to force thm to abandon their religion and become Fapists." The Pa&ric publishes a private letter from Toulon, dated 6 o'clock last Monday evenng, giving an account of the arrival in that port of the Grand Duke Constantine.. His Imperial Eighness sailed from Nice at 11 o'clock on Sunday night, on board the Russian steam frigate Olaff. The squadron which accompanied him, under the orders of Admiral: Bebrens, consisted of the screwv ship Wiborz, the steam frigate Polkau. and the sailing frigate Lastor. aron Dubordieu, Maritime~ Prefect of Toulon, deapatehed, at 9 o'clock on Monday morning, the s3mall steamer Navette to meet the Russian squadron and pilot them from Cape Cepet. The squadron 'vas not telegraphed until half-past 12. A great movement was then perceived on board the French Meet. The drums beat to arms on board the Bretagne (carrying the Admiral's flag) and the other ships, and at 3 the batteries of the Groese Tour fired a salute of 21 guns The ards were manned in gallant style on board the fleet. At that moment the Olaff entered the outer harbour. The panoramic view was magnificent,-the clear blue sky, and the heights crowded with spectators; cries of " Vive lRmperevr" and hurrahs flUed the air, and the volleys echoing from the hills had an indescribable effect. Scarcely had the smoke caused by the guns of the fleet dispersed than the Ola0l which passed between the double line of ships, returned the salute and hoisted the tricoloured flag. The steamer stopped, and the Maritime- Prefect, with his staff in the Imperial barge, went alongside. The Prefect took the orders of the Grand Duke, and returned to shore. In the meantime the troops of the garrison were formed in the Arsenal, to pay military honour. to the ilustrious visitor. The Maritime Prefect and Admiral Trehouart received the Grand Duke on his landing at a quarter to 5. The Grand Duke is described as 30 years of age, fair, and of middle height. He wore the decorations of St. Andrevr and St. George over an admiral's uniform. Bis Highness passed through the lines formed by the troops in the Arsenal, the bands playing Queen Hortense's air, i' P2artant pour la Syrie," and the drums beating an Imperial salute. He then stepped into the Prefect's cariage and drove to the Prefecture, where the principal oflecers of the army and navy were presented to his Imperial Highness The Three per Cents, closed to-day at 69f. 30c. for the end of the month, and the Fourand-a-.alf per Cents. at 91f.

Although duly informed of the two meetings.oÂ£ the four Represeutatives of the great Powers .i Paris on the 14th, and 18th inst., and also of thi Conference meeting of yesterday, at which doubtles the mediatory prposal of the Conference ias mBi mitted to the Representatives of Prusia and Swit-, zerlaud,we have no.di#tinct inform'ation as yet what the nature of the mediatorial proposal, the finc momjen, is. The statements-already current of both Prussia and Switzerland having at onco rejected the proposal of the Confezpnce are the mere effusions of mipatient historians, vho will not wait 'for tlSe. events to happen before they chroniceethem, - ant consequently go wrong somwtimes; and they ate certainly vrong saxegars Prnssia, for, from what i hear from men in a position to be acquainted with Royal and Ministerial feelings, there is no feeling of d~issati4faction felt here wiith the little inkling that has been as yet obtained of the coming Conferene proposal, and no iclination at all to reject it, long as the principle of the unbroken oontiniift21Oe of thu v Areiguty ll) t;Qthe prons t dai is not violated. If it'be true,- as ii h ee spread abroad, that the Confqrence propo to reduce the sum to be p aidfor the arresrs of the princely revenue from 2, 000f. to 1,000 000f., it will be sod much the worse forthe poor Eoyaliatet for it is to the indeicatbn of the less wealthv among these latter, who are thus driven from thee homes and their livelihood that the 1,000,Oof. or 2,000,000f. are destined. i do not hear that it was ever intended that this sumn, whether large or small? should flow into the Royal coffers Yesterday the Minister of Commerce laid before the two Houses of the Diet here a bill for depriving all foreign paper money of currency in Prussia; on and after October l of this year it will be penal to make even a tender of it. This law is not intended to prevent money-changers from giving an equivalent for foreign paper in Prusn money, but solely to prevent its currency in the ordinary transactions of-buying and selling, and exemptions 'wi1 also be made from its action in favour of those States whose finances offer ample security for the reiation of the paper in case of need. A similar bill was pated a few years bacl, which, however, prohibited only the currency of foreign paper for leis amounta than 10 thalers, and this measure wai adopted for the protection of the petty tradesmen and other small fry, who might in their ignorance of financial affairs take the paper in the way of busi1 ness, and suffier by the known insolvency of it issuers. The present measure, eacluding all but sound paper, ia a result of the apprehensions raised by the late war; for one of the disasters that was looked forward to as certahn had Germany been involved in the lato European conflict was the bank ruptcy and declared insolvency of numerous Federal States, the result of which would have beenthe financial prostration of the commercial interests heret inlasmuch as this pLace is flooded with rub. bishmng paper money, which theneigilbouring States introduce, taksing in exchange PrusYsian paper, which beaiS an asic in the rest of Germany. FERSLt. The following is the Persian account of the late action between the British and Persian troops, taken from the Teheran Gazete of the lat Rajah,1273 (25th February, 1857):- " Soojah-ool.Moolk communicates to us in haste the following news, dated 8th Febraary:-The 7th inst. five Bug. lish regiments, having with their 10 pieces of canon, had occupied the Djah-Koutah, situatedi four leagues from Bushire, with the intention of causng our troops a cheek previous to their complete concentration at head.quarters. Soojahoo}lMoolk, having desired to anticipate the English in their plan, took with him 3,000 regular infantry,, 300 horsemen, and 12 pieces of cannon, to Attack tue enemys camp during tho night. He marched the same night. After hel had left Bouraz.Jan a league behind him rain began to fall in torrents. The English, who had left Djah-Koutah a league behind them, retreated. at the approach of our troops, and sheltered themselvs behind rocks and in caverns, while our troops, being on a great plain, without shelter, and exposef to heavy rain, withdrew to their camp. The English troops, thui preerved from the rain, hastened to reach Bonraz-Jau before daylight. Soojah-ool-Moolk pursued them with his 3,000 picked troops and eight piees of cannon. The English advanced guard annoncede the arrival of our troops by a shot. The English, seeing that they could not tmansport their ammunition on came1s, in consequence of the mud, burnt it, and retreated towards Bushire. Oar troops pursued them to within four lea3,nes of that place. In the meantime, two other Euglsh regi- ments and 400 cavalry, with 10 pieces of cannon, came from. Bushire to their assistance. After the arival of this reinforcement the English turned round, and the battle began. Although the number of our troops was much info. r or to that of the enemy, they fought with great deternilnaiion and courage. The battle ommenced at daylight, and lasted four hoursand a half withoutintermirsion. Ourtroops showed the greates t bravery; twice they penetrated into the enemy's ranks and brok-e them. We had heard that Stackler [Stalkerl the general who first arrived at Bushire vwas kied in the battle; but that account is not tmre. Oa our side the S artip Mahomed Kouli E han Javau-Schir and the Sartip Ali bayn, K ara-Qioglou, in penetrating into the enemy's lines were woonded, the first with a grapeshot and the second with a sabre-cut, but their wounds are not serious.

H^d this been accepted the wrork would have beon -adote, for the funds for its execition were to come from much surer sources thasi the Spanish Ttesury. But the plan had the graye objection of originating with foreigners, and it 'was also chiefiy by foreign capital and enterprie that it was tobe fulfilled. Spaniards, perhaps the most tedious and unpractical people in the world, have a great jealousy of foreign interference and astance, And dislike to see money made in their country by any one but themselves. A notorious Spanish banker, who was mixed up in v2tious queer transactions in the time of Chrisna and the Polacos, made a tender rather more favourable thantbat of the other company. It was8accepted, the deposit was paid and forfeited, and the firt stone of the new works has still tobelaid. The Puerta del Sol, the heart and centre of Madrid, is a bhaos of rubbish, where the ejes are blinded with dust and offended by heaps of loose stones and f1raments of brick and mortar, by unfinished sealfoldings and hideous hoardings. While this is the state of things in the most crowded thoroughfare and principal plaza of the capital, the Minister of Public Works announces the enlargement of Madrid. Small as its area is, compared to any of the large European capitals, there still is abundant room for enlarging hadrid by building within its walls, by puning down worthless tenements, the,bad distribution of which entails great waite of space, and by erectingroomyhouses in their stead. There is no need to step outside the town to find space for new ed.- fices. Neither will the step be taken, and those who put forward the decree know that right well. This }fnistry will not be in offlce long enough to do the work, and ita successors will, of course, throw its plans overboard, after the fishion of Ministries in this country. But, in truth, the whole thing is one of -those diareputable "t dodgese' common here. The land in the suburbs, where building is projected (lately worthless, since its arid nature rendered it unavailable for agricultmral purpose), h4a risen greatly in price since the decree appeared. Before its appearance the friends of the Mlinister do FPomento had been purchasng largely. It is presumable they are now 4ellers. Three per Cents., 40.30 ; ditto, Deferred, 25.95.

He was first invited in 1841 toComh e forward asacadoaidtefor the honour oreprentixig n South Durham, This was a penod of great political exeitement.

Pr-otecton was rampant, and the differet counties one' after another, rejected the Whig candidates Tir ra West Riding rejected such maen as Lord Morpeth an.d Lr 3Miton.

PFeeli these in- cpetefforts; and, finally, when that stAtesman became a co= r to fre trade, and brought forward tke measure for -the repeal of the- corn laws, they supported him. (Cheers.) Such was the career he (Lord H. Vane) haLd then to act. Hi Parliamenatary "H.rence, unkppiiy for hita, extended over 16 years, during which time he ha beent united with many -of the most admirable representatives of England in Upholding those opinions which he stil adlhefed to. (A~a a0.) Since the* time he hAd, referred, to conslde eO Progress had been made. Many of the great iquestions then In agitation-having now received -their final isolution, there was not now the same stir and bustle as then1. CoMing back to their own county-, a great electon had not the eame adventitious aidls of flags prooessions, icookades, and rnbands yet still, on coming into this county, he found that those 'w~o were blue formerly were blue still. (Chcers.) He found no fallng off. He came before them as he originally did-with the samae views, with nothing new to explain, but as a tried representative, and they had again receivedahim. (Cheers) unworthily as he had represented them, and fallen far short of his full duties, still his :conduct had been such as to mnerit their confidence, and the ha one mresetther salof pprbatonupon it. ~Goernentof ordalaerson asundoubel tog 1an, wateer lasifcaton fthmemertheymihaot It would now,therefore, be for that noble lord todirectand i vibld, with the same energy with which he had wielded the ;foreign policy of the country the meuns at his disposal Atovarda domestic reforms. lApplauae. With the aet. blishment of peace it was necessary. that the Home-office should supersede the Foreign in general attention. Coming .eventscast their shadows before them, andthis election foreshadowed coming reforms. His hon. friend, the chairman, had eloquently defined the true meain of Conservative principles They wore not those wEich upheld existiDg abuses and refused timely reforms from a dread of the people. Our Government was a Go. vernment of the people, and ought to 'work for the people; and it was tho duty of every man, whatever his position, when sent to Parliament, to study the pseoples interests. His hon. friend's contrast betweea this and other countries was in many respects perfectly just. No doubt, the essence of the constitution was that every man should take his pat ina public life who had time to spare from his other avocations, and perform that part for the benefit of the pubUc, by promoting laws for the general 'weal. (Cheers.) Certainly he had acted on that principle, and he felt, now that the election hgd been made, that he had a coUeape in Mr. Peas who would act on the same prnciple, and that in his person the ranks of reform would be augmented. On the subject of reform it would be premature and unwise in any man to enter into any specific promises. Those who had experience 3n public life were aware that men must act with parties. Hesagreed with the chairman that, looking to the future, it was obviously their duty to bring within the franchise many 'who were now excluded from it. (Applause.) Bat he also agreed with his hon. friend that in dealing with this subject it would bo necessary to bear in mind the nicely balanced inÂ£titutions of an old country, and endeavour to harmonize the different interests affected. In speaking of a fature Reform Bill, therefore, it was imposible to go farther than lay down the genieral principles upon which it should be carried out.

The object of this suit waas to obtain a set-off of 1,5WI. against a sum of 9,5001., under the following circum. stances :-General Cavendish having banked with Sir John Dean Paul and Co. for many years, had, some time previously to their bankruptcy, borrowed of them three Eeparate eums-two on bond (3 000h. and 5,OOOh), and one on his promissory note for 1,5O0t These several secwities the bank had Lssigned, without the knowledge of General Cavendiah, to the trusteqs of the marriage settlements of a Mrs. Pitzgerald and a Mrs, Gore; and proceedings were now being taken against Gencral Cavendish upon them. It ap- ared however, that Sir John DeMn Paul and Co. tdcertain moneys of General Cavendish in their posses. sion at the time of tLeir fulnre, and it was these sumsamoanting to somiwhat above L,5-Z.that it was now sought to have sob off against the securities above men. tioned.

The bill was filed forobtaining D&yment of eertain works executed by the late Mr. M'Intosh for the Great Western Bailway Company, or for an aocount of the moneys due in respect of those works, and on the hearing the Vice-Chancellor made a decree for an account. It being necessary to examine certain witnesses En relation to the inquiries directed by the decree, the present application for the appointment of a special examiner, instead of leaving the witnesses to be examined by the public examiner of the court, was made with a view to expedito the progress of the litigation. Mr. BAcox and Mr. T. ;STEVEMS, for the defendants, consented to the apulication. 'The VICE-OA.ZiOELLOn said that tha evidence had already reached an enormous length, and from the way in which the case was being condaucted it bid fair to outlve the present plin, as it had ilready outlived the origdnai plaintiff. Hte would adjourn the application to his chainhers, and there endevour to dispose of is. If that attempt should prove unsuccessfi4l, he would have the matter brought back into court. IN BE THE MHRONEsTSHIRE SLATE AND SLAB COMPAWI -EX PARTE RYE. This was a motion on behalf of Mr. Thomas Rye to strike his name off the list of contributories of the above company, and to discharge an order of the Master directing Kr. Rye to pay certain costs. In November, 1847, the company being then provisionally registered, Mr. ltye made applioaton for60sharesof 10 each, and at the same time nTdertook to execute a deed of settlement and to p a I deposit of 11. per share when required, 30 shares only were aUlotted to Mr. Rye, on which, in Deoember, 1847, a aeposit of ls per share was paid b Mr. Rye, or by some person to whom he had transferred bis letter of allotment. The deed of settlement of the company was dated in February, 1847 but it was not executed by Mfr. Rye. In tbe following July two calls of lOa each not having been paid on the shares allottod to 3Mr. Rye, those shares were then'declared by the company to have been forfsited. In 1849 the order to wind up was made. It apper.-ed that in the original prospectus it was stated that the capital of the company was to be 50,0001., and that 38,0001. thereof was to be applied in working a certain slate mine in Merionethshire, and that the remainig 12,0001. was not to be expended without the sanction of the shareholders. By the deed of settlement the capital of the company was raised to 100,0004., and its object was declared to be to work slate and slate slab quarries, not only in Merionethahire but elsewhere in Great Britain and reland. It was contended on behalf of Mr. Rye that he was absolved from his undertaking-first, in conse quence of the deviation of the deed of settlement from the terms of the prospectus, not only in respect of doubling the :amount of capital specified in the last-named document, but also in respect of the objects for which the company was theisin stated to be projected; and, secondly, that even if the first objection were not tenable the forfeiture of the shares allotted to Mr. Rye by the company put an end to his liability. Mr. SMIYTHE supported the motion on behalf of Mr. Rye, and Mr. MAIncs sad Mr. RoxBURGH resisted It on behalf of the official manager. 'ThO VICZ-CH"NB;LLOU Baid, that as the dead of settlemrent provided for the formation of a company entizely different from that in which Mr. Rye undertook to take shares, he did not think Mr. Rye was bound by the proceedings which had taken place under the dead- but. even if that had not beeh so, the forfeiture of the shares allotted to Mr. Rye was an extinction by the company of his undertaking contained in the letter in which he applied for shares. He thought Mr. Rye liable to nothing, anti his name muet be struck off the list of contributories. He regretted that ho had no means of compensating Mr. Rye for those costs which ho had been put to in defendine himself against demands of which he must express his highest disapprovaL IN RN THE ROYAL BANK OF AVSTnA3A_-THE CASE OF THE MUSSES BOYD. The Master to whom tho winding up of the above company bad hien referred had allowed as a debt agnst the company a snm of 1,7001., the balance due on five debentures, and also 297l. 10s. for cooupons attached to such debentures, as being due after certain deductions to the Misses Boyd, the daughters of Mr. Boyd, who was the resident director of the United Kingdom Life Asurance Company, and who died in 1846. This was a motion by way of appeal from such allowance on behalf of the official manager of the above company, The case was of a complicated nature, but the important laots aze shortly as follows *-1Y. Boyd in 1837 insured the sum of 2,9991. 19s. in the above insurance-office, to be paid upon his decease to his two sons, Mr. Benjamin Boyd and Mr Mark Boyd, in trufi for his daughters. Mrx. Boyd regularly paid the premiums upon his policy untU his death in 1840 when the amount now claimed was paid to Mr. Mark Boyd in a check, who paid the amount received by him into the partnership business of Messr Benjamin and Mark Boyd to the credit of their sisters, and they 2avested the money thus received in the purchase of the debentures of the bank now in question. Subsequently Mr. Mark Boyd becamo bankrupt, being indebted to the bank in a large amount. The bank having beeen ordered to be wound up under the Acts, the Misses Boyd preferred their claim before the Master, whioh he had allowed. Mr. MALrS, Mr. RoCIFsORD CLARIE (of the common law bar), and Mr. ROXBURGH now appeared on the part of the official manager, and submitted ,that the Master ought not to have allowed the claim of these ladies, but that the question was one which ought to have been tried by a jury before any decision should be come to by this Court on this po-int. Mr. Bacon and Mr. Karslake were for the Misses Boyd. The VICE-CHANCELLOR said, he thought the entries whieh were made in the books of the partnership for a series of years of payments on the footing of these ladies being the owners showed that these ladies had a right to have the debentures delivered up to them, and rebutted the case of fraud which had been suggested. It was a mistake to say that a declaration could not be made without the knowledge of a cestui pue trust, and he thought the entries which had been made would have entitled these ladies to claim the bonds against the Messrs. Boyd and each of them. He saw no reason for submitting this case for the consideration of a jury, to do which would be oppressive. He should therefore refuse the motion with costs. LBefore ViCe-C7ancellor Sir W. P. WOOD.) TIIE ATEOWNEY-GENERAL V. THE EAST DURHA-M CORN. EXCHANGE COMPAÂ£NY. This matter came on by way of an adjourned summons. The relators in the information had taken out a summons in the Vice-Chancellors' Chambers, calling upon the defendantg, the company, to make a full affidavit as to the documents in their possession relating to tho matters in question in the suit, and to produce them. The CnEF CIxEx objeoted to granting the order, on the ground that the information being filed against a corporate company, there was, in fact, no defendant who coald make a proper affidavit within the meaning of the Chancery Improvement Act. The summons had been amended by calling upon the defendants to produce upon the oath of their secretary such documents, &c., relating to the suit as by the affidavit to be filed should appear to be in their possession. An objection having been taken on behalf of the company that they could not make their secretary responsible with reference to the docutments and that by the Act of Parliament it was clearly intended' that production should be made by a defendant only, and by him upon oath, the summons had been adjourned into court. Mr. ROLT and Mr. CHARLES HALT, for the relators con tended that they were entitled to a produotion of theae docureents upon oath, without being put to the delay and expense of making the secretar a defendant morely for the purpose of this production, cThe VtC CeNhanLOtt (without calling on Mr. Cai and r. F. S. Williams, e ho appeared for the compafy) gaid that he could not makeutheorder in the form inwhich - wasasked. lie hadno juisdictionunder the Act, for the words braydirect the party upot oath to prodnoe" could mean no otheieath than that of the defendant himself. It was the codataut practice that the officer of the company should be made a party merely for the purposes of discovery, bat in this case the Court had no authority over the secretar, wvho had not been madeahparty to the suit; nor ceuld it bce said that the oompany had any power over him for the purpose required. MANRY V. BEWICKE. Th;e Vice-Chancellor being occupied during the rest of the day in heang motions, no further progress was made in this case, which wil be resumed this morning.

At. tle sitting o!jtbe Court this morning, id CAsii'iltT, Ii,nded down to the Master two new wh,.ich' le A h agieed to by itll the judges. le TU1&kR,heh rpad the rules as follows: * ;ASTEi ThR !, 1857.

But if the defendant give no such notice the plaintiff mnay produce such endorsement to a judge at chambers, for an order for costs CX partee; and if the judge shall sign his name to the endorsement such signature shall be an order for costs, and the Master may tax them thereon accordingly. In case of any aplication for costs without such endorsement the nlainti.. shall not be entitled to more coats than if he had mde such endorsement, unless a judge shall otherwise order. BULE-ENTRY OF SATISFACTION ON JUDGAWTS 'Upon a satisfaction piece, duly signed and attested, 'in accordance with the 80th rule of Hilary Term, 1853, being prented to the clerk of the judgments of the masters in the court in which the judgment has been signed he shaU file the same, and enter astatfaction in the judgmuent-book, against the entry of the said juadgment, and no roll shall; rsq'uired to becarried in for the purpose of entering 5aaif tion on a judgment. lord CAMPBELL said that the first of the above rales had become necessary by an enactment of the last seasioi, which was meant to favour suitors, and to decrease xpeases, bat which in practice had been found to increase costs, It was hoped the rule vould prove a remedy. The second rule was made with the view of lessening expentes incurred, without any risk of increase to suitors on the one side or the other. THE QUEEN V. HUNT. Mr. FiE. moved for a rule to quash an order made by the Poor Lav auditor for a district in Wnrwickshire, whereby be diaallowed the sum of 21., paid to the town clerk of Birminghsan, for preparing and printing the Par. liamentary register of voters. The auditor had disallowed the payment on the authority of the decigion of this Court in * T he Queen v. the Guardians of the Poor of KingDstonupon-Huull" (22 L. J. Q. B. 32 4), where the Court held that the town clerk was entitled to be repaid the expenises incurred by him in carrying the Act (the 6th and 7th Victoria, cap. 18) into effect; bu' that the words "espenseg incurred" were confined to 4csts out of pocke1 and that a town clerk ws not entitled to any remuneration for the time and labour he might devote to the performanoe of the duties Imposed upon him by the Act. In the present case ono of the pmynents made by the town clerk was for printing and preparing the listo and arranging the names in alphabetical order. Mr. Justice BERL asked why the latter duty could not have been perfoxwed by n ordinary clerk. Lord CAsarizE said another payment was for revising the proof; that was done by the author. As the certiora' had been granted the learned counsel might take a rule. Rule niri granted. rEIi?UOUGH V. TME SITIrGBO-U!NE A"m' SlIElES RAILWAY COMPANY. - In this case the plaintiff, an allottee of shares, brought an action against the Sittingbourne and Sheerness Railway Company to recover back the deposits paid on 240 shares. At the trial the plaintiff obtained a verdict for 120W.; but subsequently a rule was granted for a new trial, on the ground that the terdict waa igainat the evidence. It appeared that the applicant for shares was by the prospectus required at the tuie of application to pay a deposit of ls. on each share, and to express his readiness to accept. the shares zplied for, or any less humbor which the directors might allot. 'The directors allotted the plaintiff 200 shares, but before the letter sgnifying the allotment was posted, and before the plaintiff was informed of the allotment,-he called at the office and revoked hism application. On proof of these facts the plaintiff obtained a verdict Mr. BovIuL, (C.C., And Mr. NxarnRA, on a Drevious day, showed cause s&ainst the rule, and oontended that tih verdict was right; The contract was not complete until the company had done some act by which they were bound, but nti the letter of allotment reached the plaintiff, or was posted, there was no complete contract. Before either of those events had taken place the plaintiff had revoked his the. M. C BA mRS, Q.C., and Mr. BLAINX supported the rule, and contended that as soon as the allotment was made a contract was complete, under which the allottee was bound either to accept the shares or to forfeit' the dePosit. Lord CAhBELL said the point was one of great importance, and the Court thought thero ought to be a new trial on payment of cts, in order that all the necesary evidence might be given and the question put in a shape for decision, if necessary, on appeal, unl1ess the parties could agree to state the facts in a special case. Rcle accordingly. PELL V. BURCHEL. Thi 'wasa , rule to enter a nonsuit. The defendant was a shareholder in the Royal British Bank, and the question raised was whether the defendant was liable to be sued by the plaintiff, a de.poItor,-for a debt due by the bank, or 'whether the plaitiff ought to have sued and obtained Judgment against the company, and then proceeded to exe- uton against the indiviuwal shareholders. at the t-rial, 'which took place acme tiume since before Lord Campbel1, the plaintiff obtained a verdict for 3311., the question of law wh ethherthe action would lie being reserved for the decidion Mr Lusir, with whom was Mr. Beasley, -now showed cause against the rule, and oontended that the action was properly brought. The Royal British Bank was incorporated under the powmers of the 7th and 8th of Victoria, cap. 113. Previous to that statuto banks were ordinary p=t=e hip., O o - 7*Ia 0- . * I, Cp. -50, which provided that the banking &fin should sue and be sued in the name of a public officer; and in the case of " Stewart v. Greaves" (10, x and W., 116) it was decided, on the construction of that atatute, that actions could be brought only against such public officer, and that a creditor could not suo an individual shareholder. In this state of thin the 7th and 8th of Yictoria cap. 113, was passed, whicn for tho first time gave power, by the 6th section, to incorporate banking companies for a termn of years, but not exceeding 20 years. The 7th section then "proyided and enacted that, notwithstanding such incorporation the several shareholders for the time beingln!the said baniog business, and those who shall have been shareholders therein, and their seveial executors, administrators, suocessors, and assigns, shall be and continue liable for all the dealings, covenants, and undertakings of the said com. pany, subject to the provisions hereinafter contined as fullyasif the company were not incorpora'ted.1 The object of that section was to give a creditor the power of going against the individual shareholders. He was to have tvo remedies. He might either treat the company under that section as an ordinary partnership, and go against tho individual shareholder; or, if he pleased, he was to be at liberty, under the 9th and 10th sections, to go in the frst instanoe against the company and then to issue execution against the individual abareholders. Under the 7th section the shareholders of the company were to be and oontinue hable for the dealings, &c., of the company, "subject to the provisions hereinafter contained, as fully as it the said company were not incorporated." The learnedcounsel contendedthatitwas only bygivin bis oonstruction to the section that the liability of shareholders could continue as fully asditv as before the Act, and that the words in the 7th section, "subiect to the provisions bereinafter containied," were aswered by the proviso in the 10th section, whioh provided that a shareholder Should not beliable for the debts of the comayfrlneth three years aftir h had ceased tobe har hold ber . in Lord0 CAMPBELL, said besthought that the object of the Aict wras to limit th creditor's remedy to one action, and observed that if an individualtshareholdr could the sued hemibhlt plead in abatement the non-joinder of the other Mr. Lusr1 said that, practically, that would be impoh sible, for he must state the names and residences of all, and tha t ithey 'were all 'within the realm of iBngland, and capable Mr, LUHnad the reezonPt wasrOo tfhreyUlc baidd alway paid theiMr. Justice CiiossrroN observed that this wvas the first time for 13 years that such an action had been brought. debts before. (Laughter.) lord CABrrDELL observed that the difficulty would be got ovr by, reading the words "subject to" as meeaning "according to." Mr. P}RPSON said that was what he contended was the meaning of the section. The intention was, that the creditors should first exhaust the assets of the company, and then. go against the shareholder. The intenltionl was to create a deferred liability. Lord CAmPBELL said he felt bound, out of respcot to the Legislature, to put such a construction upon the statute as would hold the shareholder to be not liable to tho action, if he could do so, for the contrary construction would be monstrously absurd, and would lead to the nost ruinous consequences; and it would be great disrespect to the Legislature to suppose that it had done anything so ridiculous. His Lordshin agreed with Mr. Phipson that the Act was ill-drawn, andhe observed that thisstatute, and others of a like kind, placed judges in an embarrassing situation, for they were at times required to make sense out of nonsense, and to reconcile things which were irrecondileable. But his Lordship thought there was a mode of construing the 7th section which would not subject the Legislature to the Imputation to which it would otherwise be liable. The 6th seotion created the corporation, and the 9th and 10th sections provided a mode by which the individual responsibility of the shareholders was preserved for the benefit of the creditor. That provision was sensible and satisfactory, for it would prevent more than one action being brought, and give the creditor a full remedy against the individual shareholder; for having obtained judgment against the company, he coud resort to 'each individual shareholder, unti satisfaction Bhould be obtained. But if,rin addition to that, a multitude of actions might' be brought, and each individual shareholder miight be sued, that wovld Only bring on an inundation of litigation and vexation without any real benefit to the creditor. The interpretation to he put on the 7th section was that it was intnded to guard wasinst the effets of the 6th section by providingt that the individual liability should still re- main, and that the shareholders should sti be and continue liable. It said that the shareholders should be and continue " liable for all the dealings, covenants, and undertakings of the said company, subject to the Provisions hereinafter contained, as fully as if the compahy 'were nxot inicorporated."1 The difficulty~ arose from the words "tsubject to ;"1 but if wods instead of being "subjct orted rong on herenftrcontained," had beeni7 "acr ing vit visoios hereinafter contained," thje seto wouldhaee romonized with the 9th and 20th sections.- Looking at ~the scope ani object of the Act, the intentionj of the Legisla. trie -appeared to he that there should he but one actin and that execution should be Issued against all' the share' holders, and not that a multitude of actionis should1 be brought. Hlis Lordship was of 'opiniont that the action Was not~ maintainable, and that the rule should be made abso-, lute to enter a nonsuit. Mr. Justice EsRL said he agreed in all the observation, of the Lord Chief Justice, except those which related to the wisdom of the lgislature, which he felt precluded from discussing, as he was not a member of Parliament.

ALDIS V. 1IBBERT. Mr. Powell and hIr. Holl were counsel for the plaintiff Mlr. Collier and.Mr. Karalako for the defendant. This was an action to recover compensation in damages for an assault, and for putting the plaintiff out of doors. The defendant pleaded "Not Guilty." According to the plaintiff's case, as deposed to by herself and her mother, ahe hadlodged with the defendant at Stonehouse, in Devonshire, where he was superintendent of police. On tjhe30th of ay sha and her mother came home between 10 and 11 oclock in the evening, and went into her room upStairs.

The defendant Btate&that the plaintiff had lodged in his houie at Stonehouse in 1853, and again in 1855 and 156. Her eondauct was of such a character that he gave her notioe to quit; she sayed out till 3. o'elock in the.morning. He remonstrated with her, but she said she ihold, doa she pleased.

Both mother and daughter attacked him, and he bad great difficulty in keeping them at arm's length. He at last. sucoeeded in putting them both out of doors. The day after his wife's confinement the plintiff got several people into the house and played the piano ad danced, and kept throwing halfpence to a man who was playing the hurdy7gardy opposite the i0oue to keep him there.

This was an action upon a bil of exchange, the defendant 'having endorsed it. It appeared that the defendant had written his name, on the face of the bill, instead of the usual place-the batk of it. It was submitted for the defendant that the endorsement must be in the usual place, aud the defendant could n,t therefore be sued as the endorser.

COURT OF COMMON PLEAS. WYnTmTw. A (Sittings in Banco, Easter Term.) This w specl paper day, and the causes caUled on f r argument were-entirely devoid of public interest. (Sittings at isi Prius, at Guildhild 4 before Mr. Juste WILTAS and Commom Jurie) This was the first day of the first sittings at Aiei Prius in London, and the causes disposed of were not of sufficient interest to demand a detailed report. The case of* ",Laws and Another v. Rand," in which Tr. Serjeant Pamy and Mr. Honyman were counsel for the plaintiffs, and Mr. Edwin James, Q.C., and Mr. Wood represented the defendant, involved several points of importance to the commercial community;- but, as it will be argued in the full ocurt, it is only reqit to stat that it was an action tc recovtr the amount of a check for 100., drawn by one Bedford (a then partne with the defendant), in the nwme of the firm of Beford and Rand, hut not presented until after tho dissolution of that fim and the withdrawal of their tccod.t from the bank at which the check was made payable. It was urged that the check was not presented in a reasonable tune, and numerous other points were taken forthe defence. All objections, however, to the validity of the docurehe -in qestio will be ope to the learned counsel for the deendant; for at the close of the case a verdiet'was enteted or the plaintiffs on some issues, and for the defendant on others, with leave to each party to move, the Court bein at libert;yto draw such inferencers from the facts as a-u, might do, and to determine the quesUions Of laW arising out of the evidence.

ARCHES' COURT. TRmSDAY. ATP1r. 9- DZNISON V. DITCHIa (Before Sir J. DoFsox.) 0ir duU# ijODSOw deilvered judgment on the point aTgued on Monday and TUOsday last-namely, whether or not the proceedings in this. cause had been commenced within two years after the alleged offenoe, as prescribed by the Church Discipline Act. After stating the steps taken prior to the ewecoming to this court he went on to say thAt the queesion wlhich the Court.wxw-ed upon to decide dePended upon what was the true conmrction of the 20th eection of the atatute, which enacted, "t every sult er proceeding against a clerk In holy. orders for any offence against thelaws ecclsadetiel. shall be commenced within two years aft6r the commWision-of the offenoe in respect of which the suitor prcceeding shall be instituted, and not afterwarden. The question wa, when this-whatever it Wm to be called-whether it was a p,oceeding or whether it was a Â£uit agalnst Archdeacon Nulsni' DomMenood. On b:zhalt of the archdeaonx it Wa COn. lended that the commensment, of the xmit or proceeding was referable 'to the servioe of the requinition or citation n tbe Aschdean to appear beforethe Court of Bath, being the only comt whicb, under the circumstances, had authority to adjudicate bethin the partife Qa, the other' it wasr id for Mr. Ditcher that the commencement of the suit or proceeding wa, fizslt the isuing of the commission of inquiry by the Archbishop; but if that was not the case, then it mnsAbe considered thbat it commenoed at the timne of the filing of thearticles in the CoLrt of Wells and alsain the Vicar-GeneraPs Court in London; and, if not then, it mist be talcen that the aervice upon the Archdeacon of tho srtic1es must be the Commenoement, because they contained the charge against him.

Here, undoubtedly, there wla- suit not within the two years, and consequently, as it appeared to the Court, the charge brought ainst Archdeacon Denion was not within the period Ieqred by the satute. 'Therf' hid been some cases de9termined upon that point, several of which had been cited in the course of the argument. In the "Bishop of Lincoln v DaysW (4Notes of Cases, 304), Sir Herbert Jeuner Fust heldthat this court could not proceed irth regard to offenoesaooittedAt a greater d ci time than two years,Altlopgh acourtot in r,rom is s1tting nearer to tha time ci thes offences, f wigtlave ii- qroa into them. It was saidat thatrouldonlyr appl to cases which were'broight by letters of request, but if the case had been brought before the Bishop or Archbishop who had granted the commion of inq hemight have included all thoso facts that were char before the commissioners, whether they occured within the two years or not It would be the same whether the proceedings were by letters of request or not. In "Brooks v. Cresswell" (4, lotes of Cases, 432) Sir Herbert Jeuner 'ut laid dow the same prnciple. He (Sir John Dodeon had takenthe mame view in 'sThe Bishop of Hereford v '-," 12 B-ches son, 595). That must' be considered as th doctrne of the Court, right or wrong, as to the course which had been ursued, and from which he was scarcely at liberty to Kpart,.unless it should be made clearly to appear that there had been some great error committed on the point or unless there had been some decision by a snpeior cour, to which, of course, it would be his duty at once to bow. In the present case the Archbishop and his learned asesors had come to a different conclusion, and certainly he should bow withal deference a nd espect to them; bnt hehad been taught thatthe Archbishop, upon the present oocasion, was sitting, not as Archbishop, but as and for the Bishop of Bath and wells, and that must be considered as an inferior oourt, from which the appeal lay to the Court of Arches. He must therefore adhere to the doctrine which had been laid down by his leaned predecessor, and which had been folRowed by himself. The only conclusion to which he oould come was this:-that the suit or groceeding, or whatever It was to be termed, had not been rought within the time required by the sttute; that more than two years had elpsedfrom the time of the commimlon of the alleged offence, and it was therefore the duty of the Court to pronounce for the appeal, to reverse the decision appealed from, and to dismiss the Archdeacon from all uher observce of justice in this suit. He would make no order as to costs. The A 3mL-AnvooATz presed the Court for costs from the time tihe protest wras given in in the court below. The learned JIhGE said, that the case would probably go before the Judicial Committee, who would rectifyany error into which he had fallen. He would give no costs Mr. BAraRSrs, on behalf of Mr. Ditcher-, with all due deference, aUleged an appeal.

Mis HoNouR now gave judgment upon the question of celtitcate.-It is objected, on behalf of the assignees, that being hopelessly insolvent in November, 1854, the ban'krnut had mcurred new debts to a very large amount; that -his expenditure was excessive, that he gave fraudulent preferences, and that he kept bad books. There is no doubt that he was insolvent mn November, 1854, to a very large amount. His expenditure certainly was improperly large, but if a trader can be justified in incurring new debts wh4. to every person but humself he appears to have been hon - lessly iisolveat, I do not think that the expenditure in this case very much exceeds what, If solvent, he mi*ht have beea justified in expending. That the bankrupt did make two fraudulent preferences Ixm satisfied. The time that, it his taken to enable the bankrapt to make out hisaccounts proves his bad book-keeping. Were I to follow my. own 3ndgnient, I should refuse this bankrupt his certificate altogether, on the ground that a trader cannot beexcuse1 lcuring new debts when he knowe or ought to lknou. that he cannot expect to pay them; but as, from the decl sions of the superior courts it appears that I am in error 3, s asy duty to adopt their decisions.

By tIwis.-I never touched the defendant before he struck me. I neverreceived money from any one to procure a bed. I never heard of any one in the company's service having received money on that aceount. Four witnesses were examined who corroborated the complainant's ment. It was endeavoured to be elicited in the cross-examination ihat the servants sometimes reoeived money to procure beds, but without success.

Both piners answered them, and directly they saw her husband both commenced a simultaneous attck upon him, striking him down with blows on the head, and kicking him about the legs and body till he was oontused all over. " I tried to save my huiband,' sid the woman, " a well a6 I could, bat they struck me down, and the first prisoner kicked me in the face and chest, and his brother did so likewise. I was injured in the stomach, mry face was dreadfully cut and bruised, and my clothes were all over blood flowing from the cute in ry face. I asked them not to kill e, and tried to cover my husband from their il-usage when they had knocked hia down, but they knocked us both down, and on our rising knocked us both down again. My nose is almost cut into three parts." The husband, who also displayed ruarks of ecandalons usage, aated,-The second pisoner stmck me in the face the instant he saw3 me, and the ether immediately jumped upou mie.

SARREBXPS' COURZT April 23. BARING v. GORDON. CBm[. CON.-D]AMA43, 3.000. (WJ3fore Mr.' UndervSherHff BURcicnxL. This was a writ of inqui.ry to assess the damages in an 'ction brought in one of the superior courts against the deTendant for havinghadcriminal conversation with the plain. tid's wife. Judgment had been suffered to go by default, and the defendant did not now appear. Mr. Bovill, Q. C., and Mr. Unthank appered for 1im 1,Iaintiff Mr. UNTIEEmA said the declaration set fortl that t1uc d-e Sendant had debauched the plaintiffs wife, ad the 4anages ,were estimated at 3,0001. The plaintiff was WiUiam Frederick Baring, and the defendant George Tomlin9 CTordon. Mr. BOVILL then opened the casg. He saidit was one of 'a very painful class-painful under any -circmstances; bat he was glad to be able to inforn the ery that they would be {spared the most distressing part of -such an inquiry-proof of the fact alleged in thedeclaration, that 'the defendant had had crihnnl conversation with the plaintiff's wife; for it, was adunitted by the defendantindeed, it was beyond denial-and the only question the jury wosid have to determine was the amount of damages the plaintiff should recover under the circumstances which would be placed before the=. The plaintiff in the action 'was a son of Mr. Eenry Baring, brother of Lord Ashburton, :.nd in November, 1845, he was married to the lady, then just about of age, whose conduct was the subject of these proceedings. She was the daughter of Sir Richard Jenkins; she had fortune and position, combined with personal attractions, a refined intelligence, and great accomplish. 1ents. They resided ir Paris for several years after their marrage, and on returning to this country they lived a, Gulldford, from which place they went, in 1852, to reside St Eaton-hall, near Retford, in Nottinghamhuire. They had two children-one a boy, %bout l year of ago, t.he *other a girl, about eight. After they had settled in Notting- laamshire they mixed in the best society of the county, and visited and received visits from the gentry of the vicinity of -theirreeidence, and associated with many persons of rank aud station. The defendant resided at a shorb distance from Baton-ball, and he was a person of some means and position, holding the commission of a captain in the Nottinghamshire Mlitia, or Sherwood Foresters. An acquaintance sprung np between him and the plaintiff- they frequently visited each other, thev became most intimate fnends, went out together to enjoy the sports of shooting and hunting, an., and visits were frequently exchanged between Mrs. Baring and Mr. Gordon. That was in 1852, and such state of things continued down to March in the present year. The laintiff and his wife had always hved upon terms of the happiest endearment, and in the enjoyment of every comfort and luxury which affluence and station could give, until the unhappy discovery was made which had led to these proceedings, which had destroyed a life of happiness to Mr. Baring, had sent to ruin and disgrace a woman upon whom the least suspicion had never falen, and reduced her children to be perhaps worse than orphans. In March the plaintiff found that Captain Gordon, who had professed so much friendship for him, had, while enjoying his Isospitality, seduced his wife. On the 11th of that month Captain Gordon and Mrs. Baring left Nottinghamnshire and came to London together, under eircumstances of the deepest diatess, not only to the plaintiff, but to Mrs. Gordon, who was at that time in a condition which rendered the matter a great deal more painful. In the greatest agony of mind Mrs. Gordon went to a lady named untsman, a friend of both her and Mrs. Baring, and with that ladY she came to London. Mr. Huntsman, who was a friend of the plaintiff, followed them, and he and his wife and m Gordon traced the defendant to the GreatWestern Botel, where he was taking breakfast with Mrs. Baring when they arrived. AIMrs Baring rose from the table, and when Mr. Huntsman went in he found Mrs. Gordon in a fainting condition on her knees. When the defendant was appealed to he refused to leave Mrs. Baring, and such was the shock to Mrs. Gordon that it well nigh proved fatal-she being then close upon her confinement. That adultery had -taken place had been admitted ; there could have been no -answer to that. Mrs. Baring was sent to her mother, Lady Jenkins, and the jury would have to assess the damages which Captain Gordon should pay for the great wrong he had done in destroying a life of happiness which the plaintiff had been blessed with. He could not conceive or suggest one single circumsance paUiative of Captain Gordon's conduct, Received into the plaintiff's house as a bosom friend, accom-panying him in shooting excuriions to Scotland and other places, he had abused the friendship with which he had been regarded, violated the generous hospitality which it had been the plaintiff's pleasure to afford him, brought disgrace upon the plaintiff and lis family, broken up a happy life, and sent this unhappy lady to a position of infamy and disgrace. No amount of damages could compensate a plaintiff in such a case as this. The verdict of the jury was sought, as they would have surmised, with a view to ulterior proceedings, and he believed that, had not the damages been set at 3,0001., the ury wvould readily have &warded more than that amount. Captain Gordon had four children, and he repeated that he -could not see anything whatever to palliate his conduct. The certificate of the mrriage, which took place at Pars, was then put in, and also a settlement executed on thu marriage Of 8,0001. Mr. Henry Huntsman,examined.-Ireside at West RetfordhaUl, Nottinghamshire, and have done so for some time. I was living there when the plaintiff and his wife took possession 'of Eaton-hail as their residence. That was in tbe autumn of 1852. Eaton-haU is the plaintift's present residence, and is about two miles from mine. After their arrival I and MUrs. IItsman visited them, and the intimacy was 'continued between us and Mrs. Baring uatil this distressing matter was known. Mr. Baring, I should think, is about five or six-and-thirty years of age ; Mrs. Baring somewhat younger. They have two children, a son and daughter 'one 11 and the other about eight years of age. They lived in good style, and, of course, had horses, carriages, and servants requisite for their establishment. Captain and Mrs. Gordon lived about nine or ten miles from Retford. The two families, Baringa and Gordons, were on terms of the closest intimacy within a few months of hlr. Baring -coming there. Captain Gordon is about 34 years of age. 'They have four children living, but have had more. They lived in good society. Captain Gordon was a hunting-man, and assooiated with the best society of the county. Mr 'Baring and his wife always hved very happily together; it seemed his pleasure to gratify her in any wish she might express. He was extremely attentive to her. He was once absent for six weekis, when he went to America; and once he went to Marseilles to meet his sister on her way from 1India. I went to see him off by the steamer for America. Those were the only two occasions on which he was absent for any time. On the 1Ith of March a communication was made to me. Mrs. Gordon and Mrs. Huntsman came to London by tbe express-train, and I followed them by a later -train at 12 o'olock. At 4 o'clock in the morning I found 'them at the Great Northern Hotel. There had not been ,the least possible suspicion of Mrs. Baring before that -time. From inquiries I made of a porter I found that Captain Gordon and mrs. Baring had gone from the Great Northern Railway to the Great Western Motel. We went there, and, having found Captain Gordon's room, Mrs. Gordon was ushered in by a waiter. I remained outside with Mrs. Huntsman, and after some little time I went in, when I saw Mrs. Baring sitting by the breakfast table. Captain Gordon was standing, with his wife on her knees before him in a fainting state. The -scene was most painfuL Mrs. Baring rose from the table when I went.in. -I desired Mrs. Gordon to retire, as the -excitement raight-have-been dangerous to one in her condi. -ion. Captain -Gordon asked me to let him have five minutes alone withihis wife. Mrs. Baring walked out of -the room. At Mrs. Gordon's desire I consented to her husband's request. In about 20 m3inutes I went in, and found her again on her-knees. ;It was a most distressing scene. Sle owas entreating him to choose between the two. He -refused to go home with her. Shortly afterwards he left -he room and sent see a message that he was going away, 'but would give me his address if I had anything to 'write to him about. I then took Mrs. Gordon back to -thee Great Northern Hotel. 'Captain Gordon visited her in Me.4HenryBaring.-amone of thefirnnofBaring, Brothers d am - brother of the plaintiff.

THE CROSS OF VALOUB. TO THE EDITOR OF TIHE TIMES. Sir,-I am a sergeant of nearly three years, lately retired from the 17th Lancers, at the early age of 26 years, solely in consequence of being passed over, most unjustly, in the rewards and honounrs that have been bestowed. I am now made drill sergeant in the Sherwood Rangers, Mansfield, by its noble colonel, His Grace the Duke of Newcastle, and, wishing my fellow-men to know how unjustly I have been treated, I beg of you to allow me a place in your columns, so generously open to private as well as public grievances, to state my services as briefly as poseible. Afterbeingat the Alma I was present with my regiment in every engagement that took place. I charged at Balailrava with my squadron until it was nearly annihilated, my own lance being shot away. Drawing my sword I galloped on to the Russian guns and assisted in cutting down the gunners. On the right of our forming line I observed one particular gun going away as fast as the horses could take it. I went after it with Captain Jervis, of the 13th Light Dragoons, who shot one of the horses and delayed its progress. On this I engaged two of the gunners, who both fell. It now became a struggle for our lives, as a large body of Coasacks surrounded us. I succeeded in working my way through them, and galloped in the direction of what I judged to -be our own Hussars, I found they were Russians reforming. I forced my way on full speed through them unhurt. A regiment of Polish Lancers, 800 strong, had iormed acros3 the valley. I halted a moment to look around. Perceiving several of our cavalry in the same dilemma, I called to them, and being then a corporal I used what authority I had to form them as well as I could. We gatbered 12, and cbarged their centre; most of us got through. I believe three fell. These men were 4th and 13th Light Dragoons and 17th Lancers; one was of the 8th Hussars. I received the point of a lance in the right hand; the wound was slight. The Russian infantrv now opened a heavy fire upon us, and, after galloping through the guns of the enemy in advance of us, each man separated, trusting to fate. Private James Cope and Private James Wightman, now Corporals of the 17th Lancers, were of the number. Wightman waseseverely wounded, and taken prisoner for 12 months. GInthe 5th of November, 1854, I was at the battle of Inkermann, and under fire. Cornet Clevelard was shotand when our regiment was ordered to retire I asked CaPtain Mdorgan to allow me to fall out of the ranks to assist in carrying Mr. Cleveland off the field. Troop SergeantMseor'O',ara and Private James O'Eaa,, of thesame regiment, also foil out for that purpose. in perforsin that act Jameas O'b Eaa and nmyself had both our dress caps shot olf.onr heads by a cannaon hall. 'We still pursed our duty tillnoutof range, where the cornet wished to be laid down tll a stretcher was procured. This officer died. While &tationed,at Balaklava I was one-of the detachment -ordered for theoBaidar Valley. On one occasion I was engaged in the secunnoitering party in advance of the party that took posasesion of General Chateloof's house, nearthe Woronzoffroa. Two-of the Land Transport-Corps and several mules were wounded and one killed, when the corps deserted the wagae, .and 1-was the sergeant wbo ed a detachment of my regiment to the.soot, when the Russians, on our a prOAch, Iledinto the wood, and-I placed my menonn vidette Vhich the main body had to retire upon. I may further add that I embarked with the regiment at the first commencement of the war. I served under Lord Cardigan at Devno YoniBazar at he tinme wisen disease greatly prevailed. At this time I had 6ho bonorw to be selected as corporal of a letter party stationed at Varna. The whole of the army despatches were eonvoyed by our party, and I was often compelled, in consequence cf the sickness of the men, to ride ay and Dight without rest. I was present in every.4irmish in t-whteia ary regiment wAs engaged, aud I returned home when the -campaign ended. When in Ireland vith my regiment I dnoieired"Ief my troop officer why I did not get a inE al for distfnguaihed con&act Heo told me ho wai sorry I d. d not, but it IV to the commanding offlicer' diserction. boi appeers thuy are not "distinguished conduct medals," blt "Qitereion medals ' There are sereral mxo in the 17,.5 LLefart wko wear medals for distinguisbed con act in the -fieldaf battle hvbo never crossed swords with a Rlldan.

ThELiAiD. TEE IRISH C7TIlF. ?PX!RR1AWV (rzo OtJX OWr oonm nvE i DlTlT.T-KT qr-- .- 1 The Eening, Mail states that, after all, the resignation of Mr. Horaman is an accomplished fact, and that the responsible office of Irsh Chief Secretary is at the disposal of Lord Palmerston. Except Mr. Bernal Osborne, no other name has been mentioned as Mr. Horaman's successor. According to the AaI4 the appointment of the member for Dover has been all but protested against by Lord Carlisle, and the Freemanes Journal of this morning, forgetful of 3r. Oaborne's past energetic services in the cause of Liberalism and progress, denounces the choice as highly objectionable in consequence of the hon. gentleman'a scathing speech in reference to the Irish Coort when the question of its abolition was last under the consideration of Parliament. THE GREAT CAlE SHOW. The annual show of the -Royal Dablin Society was held yesterday but, owing to the unfavourable state of the weather-the rain scarcely cea during the whole day-'the attendance of visitogs was very meagre. Lord Carlisle and the Viceregal suite arrived at 3 o'clock, and stayed in the yard for fully two hours. The exhibition of stock and farming implements was not inferior to that of any previous year, and everything, it may be said, passed off well. His Excellency was again present at the evening meeting, and the Earl of Clancarty having proposed a vote of thanks, Lord Carlisle responded in a graceful speech, in the course of whiech he thus touched upon a topic of painful interest just now to the agricultural classes . "We cannot hear of such congregations of herds of cattle without having our attention perhaps less agreeably attracted to the possible-I trust not probable-course of the visit. tion from th*ea-tl murrain which has inflicted such ravages over a great portion of eartern and, I fear I must now add, of centrl Europe-I truet that all that can be done by the authoritie3 on th3t subject will be done; but the laws of contagion and the operation of contagious and epidemic influences are still so obscure that it would be im. possible to dogmatize on the subjecti and the contrast between the healthy and flourishing appearance of these breeds of all classes- which *e have seen on the lawn and in the courts of this society to-day, with the probable altered aspect, which they must present under the visitation of such a pestilence, must teach us. i what close and immediate dependency our most cherished hopes and our best organized precautions must rest upon the Almighty's blessing. (Hear, hear, and applause.) I took the liberty just now of referring in a rather light strain perhaps to the great electoral contest which has been going on through the country. To adopt, however, for one moment rather a graver mood, inclosngthese biief rernarks, I may be permitted to mention that this constitu!ional pro. cess which is now brought to a close must inevitably, perhaps, have engendered on certain occasions some bitterness of ieeling-some interruptionsof good humour-some alienation among those who ought to be good neighbours. But I do trust that the laudable pursuits which it isthe sim of this society to encourage by these annual meetings will have their due effect in reconcming and uniting all clsses and all parties in the furthgranoe of objects which tend so much to the common good and undisputed benefit of all. Confident Ifeel that the dregs and seiment of party business cannot be carried by any more wholesome method of effervescence than in the healthy, useful, and honourable calling of agri culture. (Applause.) Parties and Governments may be subject to vicissitudes and change - but you, my lords and gentlemen, have the green soil of Ireland lying fresh beneath you-firm and fresh beneath you. There it is-do justice to it, cultivate it, enxich it,. adorn it-for yoU will find it ever ready to reward and to repay the skill and industry awiich shall beet develope its abounding resources. (Loud applause.)" THE. MOUNTGjugJ5r PEERAGE CASE. Eleven of the 12 judges sat in error yesterday for the purpose of giving judgment on the application for a new or third trial in the now historic case of " Butler v. Mountgarrett." There having been a dLsagreement of opinion, their Lordships deli:vered juadgment seriatin, 1r. Jusice Keogh, as junior, commencing, and at the adjournmen' of the court four out of the 11 had still to speak. Let the issue be what it may, it is not, of course, in the na'ure of things legal that the decision will have any other effect than that of hastening the CC beginning of the end" of all such protracted and expensive suits, namely, the final appeal to the higghest and most costly tribunal in the land. The facts of the case are briefly these:- " The action was an ejectment on the title, brought by Mr. Pierce Somerset Butler against the Right Hon. Henry Edmond Butler, Viscount Moantgarrett, to recover possession of cortain lands worth several thousands of pounds per annum, and situate in the countyof Kilkenny. The declaration in ejectment wras filed in July, 1853, and, defence having been taken, the case went to trial at the summer assizes of eIksnny Xu 1504, b f ,ra- ; D.n -and-oa upvvt Jury, and, after a protracted investigation of several days, terminated in a verdict for the plaintiff, the fact of the defendant's legtimcy being the only question to be decided. In Michaehnas term in the same year a conditional order for a new trial was granted by the Court of Exchequer, and subsequently made absolute, on the ground that iMlegal evidence was admitted at the trial, &c. The case then went down for trial again, and was ze-tried before Mr. Serjeant Berwick and another special jury at the spring assizes of 1855, when, after anotner very protracted inquiry, there was a verdict the other way-namnely, for the defendant. The plaintiff then came before the Court of Exchequer and asked for a third trial on the same gronnd tbht the second trial was granted-viz., that illegal evidence was admitted; hut that Court ws of opinion that the verdict in favour of Lord Mountgarrett should stana and it was from that deci sion that the present sppealproceedingswere iusituted. The questions raised for argument and the facts in relation to them were shortly these :-The late Esrl of Kilkenny baving died seised of the extensive estates in question, the plaintiff claimed them as heir-at-law, and adduced his title in the following manner,-viz., as the youngest brother of the deceased earl, and the lepitimate heir to the property, the defendant bemg, as he alleged, illegitimate. The deceased Earl of Eilkenny died nnmarried, and had three brothers, Somerset, who also died unmarried, Henry, the father of the defendant, and the plaintiff, who was the youngest. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant's father's marriage to his mother, Miss Harrison, was ilegal, as he had a wife alive at the time,-a lady named Colebrooke; and the only questions in the case were, in fact, was there a marriage with Mrs. Colebrooke, and was it a legal marriage, and such as invalidated Henry Butler's marriage with Miss Harrison; for, if so, it was admitted that the plaintiff would be entitled to the title and estates in question. Upon the last trial it was proposed by the plaintiff to cross-examine the Dowager M3arhioness of Ormond, who was examined for the defendant, to show that the representation of the family was that Henry Butler had formed a marriage with Mrs. Colebrooke before his mnarriage with Miss Harrison, but the evidence was objected tobythe defendant's counsel, and the objection being allowed, and the evidence accordingly rejected, the present application for a new trial was made. That was the principal point in the case; but there were some other exceptions taken to the charge of the learned judge for the exclusion of other evidence, which were of minor importance. ' Mr. Justice Keogh, having entered minutely into the facts of the case, and reviewed the arguments of counsel on both sides, his Lordship considered the authorities bearing upon the questions at issue, and concluded an elaborate Judgment by giving bis opinion that the first and principal exception, that relating to the rejection of the Marchioness of Ormod's evidence, should be allowred, and avediire de novo granted accordingly; the other exceptions to be over- Baron Greene followed, overruling al the exceptions, none of which he held could be sustained in law. " Judge Jackson and Barons Richards and Pennefather also gave judgment overrulin all the exceptions. " Judges Moore and Ball allowed the first exception, and overruled the rest. ` The Court then adjourned to 1 o'clock this day, when the other members of the Court will severally pronounce judgment. "A s the case now stands there are three members of the Court for granting a reni-e de 2ioo, and four contri-.*i E31IGRATION. Yesterday's accounts from Galway state that the progress of emigration there has not slackened, notwithstanding that the recent accounts from America are discouraging. The 4 o'clock train to Dublin was crowded with emigrants of the better class bound for the United States, and as the season advances it is feared that the drain of population will be further increased.

THE LATX ZXPLOSION AT LUNDHrLZ. miring ~ LUNDHILL Tnunspiv. rDe ig yerterday an i dtoday five more bodies have been eref ved, maid to a l h of nine which have beengot ouk of the pit.vsbegoou We have previously sated that upwards of 100 miners had volunteered to aist In the work of recoverino the bodies and restoring the pit. From this number 72 or the most experienced and intelligent men were selected to take part in the work. On Tqesday evening these men were atsembled atthe Lundhl Coal pAny's offioes and divided into six parties; each pry consisting of 12 men. An experiencea colliery viewer was deputed to direct the operations of each party, and, as from the confined space in which they are at work no more than one part could be employed at the same time, it vas arranged that they should work in shifb of four hours each. The six superintending viewers are Mr.W. Madison, of the Wou?bwell, Main Coiejr, -;r. IL C. Webster, of the Hoyland Collieries; Mr. Ralph Maddison, of the Worsbroogh Collieries- Mr Brown, of Barnsley; Mr. Potter, of the Baraley Collieries; and Mr. Palmer, a gentleman from the north. Ir. Coe, the viewer at LundhilL is deputed to superintend tho operations of the three day ibfts, and Mr. Peace, the former viewer at Lundhill, those of the three night shafts. Charcoal respirators are provided to be used when necessary, disinfeotants are supplied in abundance, and all other requisites are furnished. sugeon is also in constant attendance at the pit, to be ready in ecse of illness or accident. The first reay of volunteers commenced their operations dozng Tuey night, and one of their first pro. ceedings Ws to explore the Immediate locality of the shafts, for thepurose of removing any bodies which might be ig there. Wbithainthe shVIort distance the very partial ventilation enabled them to penetrate they spedily found four bodies, which were brought to bank at an early hour yesterday morning placed in coffins and oonveyed to the recepton shed. They were all somewhat mutilated, and in such a state of deoomposition asto be beyond the possibility of recognition, so far as the bodies themselves were concerned. Two of the bodies had no clothes on which oould be recognized, and- they were conveyed in a hearse to Darfield church yesterday evening and there interred. It was thought pomible that the other two might be identified by their boots or clothes; they were oonsequently kept with that view, and have been seen by a considerable number of the bereaved, but without being Eatisfactorily identified. 'After tSho removal of- thwfew boaies the- oould find the volnnteers eommenoed the work of removig the darfu of the fallen roofs in theneighbourhood of the shafts, as an essential prelimnaury to the reventilation of the nit. As the falls of roof caused by the fire- are: more extensive than had been anticipated, much labour will be involved in ; their removal, but the relays ae proceeding vigorously with the work. The fifth corpse was found this morning by the men on the shaft commencing at midnight and ending at 4 o'clock a.m., in the course of their excavations. Like the other bodies, it was mutilated and decomposed, and has not yet been recognized, if indeed it be recognizable, which iS very doubtfuil At the time our parcel left it was sti lying in the reception shed along with the other two not interred on the previous day, that full opportunity might begiven for recognition. ehus far-the opertions of the volunteers have been confied to the south workings of the pit, the removal of the caresses of three horses which are lymg near the shaft on the north side, and emit a veryoffensive stench, having prevented operations on that side. Preparations are being made for the removal of the carsses. Mr. Coe and some of the viewers have been able to penetrate near 200 yards on the levels and enter some of the boardgates for a short distance. So far as they have gone not the slightest sppearance of fire has been discovered but until the ventilation has been further restored, it is impossible to fuly explore the parts where the fire raged, so asto ascertain with absolute certainty that mone remains, although it is confidently believed that the fire is wholly extinguished. Mr. Co has penetrated as far as the ventilating shaft, but from the extent of the fats around it was unablefully to examine it. The examinations that have been made show that the fire had raged even to a geater extent than had been supposed, and furnish an additional evidence of the propriety of the c urse adopted in closing the mouths of the down cast shafts tocut off the current by which the fire was fed, afew hours ;after the explosion. It is expected that the enginecrs rwill meet again on Saturday, The recovery of the bodies will proceod but slowly, until the fallen air current near the shaft are restored. lo se2ious inconvenience has been experienced Ifrom the noxious effniuvi in the pit.

THE irAGARA. TO TEHE EDITOR OF T}B TIMES. Sir -I have just read in your impression of yesterday the detaied description of the Niagara, taken from the icw York Time, and I feel bound at onoe to admit that this is a ship much more likely to keep out of teauh of a line.of. battle ship and hammer at her with her enormous guns than any Tessel yet built. buthe apjars to be built for speed, and to carry very few, but very eavy guns; and if the sPeed should prove equai only to that of our fasteet screw Itnerwit will then depend on the rany of her guns whether she can. keep out of fire berself w ae she is throwing her heavy shot into the line-ofbattle shp. Her guns appear to be the largest that have ever been put into a ship, and the weight named (1701b.) for shot leads to the conclusion that they are solid, and, it so, it may well be that their range is greater than that of the solid 68-pounder. Of course, they have been tried, or the United States' Government would not have adopted them; but until we have the partioulss it is idle to speculate on what their range ir .ut a4 priori with 12 such guns she would prove a formidable antagonist to any line-of-battle ship, if only she exceeds the latter in speed. It is stated that it is anticipated her speed under steam will be 31 orl2 knots an hour, and with engines of 1,000horse power it is quite to bo expected. Her length is given as 320 feet keel, 345 deck, and breadth 55. The Queen's yacht is 300 feet between the perpendiculars (nearly the length of the deck), and 40 feet breadth, with engnes of 800-horse power. Her speed is 17 or 18 knots. This be a rough standard of comparison between these two vessels, and, as so many have seen the Queen's Zacht, it will give a pretty fair idea of what the size of the X4iagara Is. But there is no other point of comparison, as the Nipgara, being built to carry great weights, has neoessarily to be constructed of much heavier timber, and. her rigging and spars, being for a full-rigged sailing ship, make an additional impediment to her seed. Still, with engines of 1,000-horse power and only 12 Runs-monsters though they be-nandal2 knots is not a perormanceequal to that of the Agamemnon nor to that of the French Napoleon-the former with engines of 600-horse power, the latter with engines of 900-horse power. Both ships had all their weights in when they went n and 14 knots respectively; and if the Niagara does no more than U and 12 without her guns she will not have beaten these ships yet.. Bat, after all, the question whether screw line-of-battle ships are rendered useless by the construction of such frigates as the Niagara cannot be decided on such narrow Al fleets req ure frigates as attendants. Lord Nelsen called them "the eyes" of his; and as siling frigates used so So Â£,swtar,- 3~~*~io tt1Bskil hips. amw fri gates migiht well be faster than steam line-of-battle ships, without 3a the least superseding them; and,aslIsaid before, no frigate has yet reached the speed of atileast the best line-of-battie ships-not even the Niagara yet.

MILITARY EDUCATION. TO TEIE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-As you observe in your leading article of to-day relative to Military Education, "there is nothing like leather ;"-a proverb which is fully illustrated by a lon letter in 7zW Timws, advocating the continuance of the old system of educating candidates for the army at "public schooVs-i. e. cramming almost exclusively with " classics" boys whose future vocation will be to wield the sword. Give, in Heaven's name, as much Greek, Iatin and [ebrew, aS you like, to boys destined to the learned professions, but rely upon it that if a lad enters the army at 17 or 18-and the earlier he begins "sogering" the better-he wiU have plenty of "professional" matter to acauuire vvithout devoting his time to a purely " cLaical e Uca Neither Wellington nor Napoleon was very eminent as a classical scholar, yet they made very tolerable officers, whlle the late war has fulUy proved that St. Cyr can turn out quite as able military men as our public schools, in which probably fully threefourths of our Crimeau officers were brought up. But there is "nothing like leatherR "wherefore let every one stick up for his peculiar era! tf-the schoolmaster for his school-the soldierfor-. " MILITARY EDUCATION." I April 2Z.
THE GuLF STBiAm nf vz ATAnc.-The gene. ral description of the Gulf Stream, apart from any present question as to its sources is, that of * vast and rapid oceancurrent, issuing from tho basin of the Mexdcan Golf and Caribbeau Sea, doublingthe southern cape of Florida; press. ing forwards to the north-east, in a line almost parallel to the American coast; touching on the southern borders of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, and at some seaeons partially pnassing over them; thence, with increasing width and dismon, traversing the whole breadth of the Atlantic, with a central direction towards the Brtish Isles; and finally losing itself by still wider diffusion in the Bay of Biwcay, on our own shores, and upon the long line of the Norwegian coasts. Its identity in physical characters is preserved throughout the many thousand miles of its continuous flow-the only change undergone is that of degree. As its waters gradually commn le wsith those of the sxrrounding sea their deep gluo tint declines, their high temperature dimminishes, the speed with which they press forwards abates. Bnt tahing the stream in its total conrse, it well warrants the Tivid description and the name bestowed upon it by a modern author, of a " river in the ocean." Ttis epithet (bringing to memory the ios) l2EavoTo of Homer), Is, in truth, singularly appropriate to this vast current ; so constant and continuous in its course; and so strangely detached from the great mass of ocean waters; which, while seemingly cleft asunder to give path to its first impulse, areyet ever pre.sing upon it, gradually impairing ita force and destroying its individuality. The maximum of velocity, where the stream quits the narrowr channel of Bemini, which oompresses its egress from the gulf, is about four miles an hour. Off Cape Hatteras, in N orth Carolina, where it has gained' a breadth of 75 miles, the velocity is reduced to throe files. On the parallel of the Newfoundland banks it is further reduced to a mle and a-balf an hour, and this gradual abatement of fo'ce is continued across the Atlantic. The temperature of the curzent undergoes similar change. The hihest observed is about 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Between ape Eiatteras and Newfoundlad, though lessened in amonnt, the warmth of the stream in Winter is still 25' or 30' above that of the ocean through which it flows. Nor is this heat wholly lost whenitreaches, and is spread over, the coasts of Northern Europe. The waters, thus constantly flowing to us from the tropical regions, bing warmth as well as abundant moisture to our own islands, and Ireland especially, upon which they more directly impinge, doubtless derives much of its peouliarity of climate, its moisture, verdure, and abundant vegetation from this source. Were it needful to seek proof of the permanence of the great natural phenomenon of which we are speaking, we might find itin those curious passagesof anciena geographers-Pomr nians Mela and J. Solinus Polyhistor, for example-which describe the peculiarities of the Irisl soil and climate is centulies ago, almost as we should depict them now. But the influence of the Gulf Strem does not stop evenhere. The cimateit may be saidto oonvey is diffused, more or less, over the whole Norwegian coast, the aspects and produoc of which singularly contrast with those of the corresponding latitudesin -North Amerios, Greenlnud, and Siberia. Other caues doubtless contribute to this effect, but none, we apprehend, so largely or unceasigly. The influence of the temperature of the Gulf Stream upon animal life in the ocean is very curious. The |whale so sedulously shuns its warm waters as almost to indicate their trackc by its absejice, whie yet abundantly1 found on each side of it. The physical reasons are doubtless the same which preventthis great marine mamjalfrom ever crossing the equator from one hemnihere to the other -a fact now well ascertained. The vanous species of fish which are firm and of excellent flavour in the colder belt of the sea upon the American coast lose all their good qualities when taken out of the Gulf Stream running closely j parallel to it. On the other hand, the morodelicatemarmne productions, whether animal or vegetable, which multiply and prosper by warinth are redundant in the Gulf Stream, tven after it has quitted the tropcAl regions wlk&enoe its beat is derived. The food is thus watured for the whale field of the Azores, where this huge .4eiiizen of t% seas flourishes in eolder le-ratg amiid the i,d=# ioe so pfoyl B-dinhburkh Rvie.

It was reeclved. y ?AtoiB t~opetition 10!the extenion of the Registration of Voters' Act to oountirew in Scotland, the minority thinking that the oDventioa,. should limit their proceedings strictly to burgh busienes. It was resolved, on the motion of the prese", "that the Convention regret the want of success which has hitherto attended the efforts of the Lord-Advocate to improve the system of education in Scotland, and earnestly urge his Lordship to renewbis efforts in Parliament for the attainmentrof that important object.* Mr. Dounc WI..reh moved "that the Convention petition Parliament for the assimilation of the law of Scotlandl to that of En d fre- of representatives for shiresu in Pridment." The Provost. of DiUefries seuonded the motion, which was supported by several other b embe. It was opposed by Profesor Aytoun, whostated th amthi sfchew caled for as a. matter of justice to Scotland it could not he refused to Ire. land, where it would probably have this effect, that not a single Protestant would be returned for the whole of that country; also by the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, who representedl that to introduoe a feudal property franchise of 4t into Siotland as an equivalent for the Eglisth freehold franchins would be toge amuchwiderfranchie lat exisu in England. It was ao shown that in many cams the burgh freeholders would comnpletely ammp the real county constituencies After a loneg disusion the motion was rejected by 22 to 13.
