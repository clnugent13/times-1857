.fONEY-JMARKETad CITYITBLLIGBNCO. Saturlay Evening. 'The features of the Bank return for the past week caused disappointment this rorning, and the funds opened at a further reaction of an eighth. Subsequently there was a disposition to improvement, but the market was less strong at the close of the d1ay. Consols for money, which left off yesterday at '4 to i, were first quoted 931 to 94. They then recovered until there were buyers at 94k, but the last official price was 94 to J. Bank Stock closed at 21( to 218; Reduced, 94i to &; New Three per Cents, 914i to i; Exchequer-bonds, 9Si to J ; India Bonds, 2s. discount to 2s. premium; and Exchequerbills, par to 4s. preniium. Mloney was again in comparatively good supply to-day, but the large amounts to be repaid by the cc imniercial public to the Bank for advances nm3de during the shutting, will lessen the inerease of ease tbat uiight otherw\ise be expected from the divi-dcends. Foreign securities have not exhibited anv great alteration, business having been generally limited. 'TuridshSix per Cents, for the account were negotiated at 95$ and 83; Brazilian Small, 1010 ; Mexican, for .account, 21; P =ortuguese Three per Cents., 44; Riussian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 96X; the ,-nall, 97 ; anid Spianislh New Deferred, 231. The prices from the Paris Bourse this evening failed to ;arrive. About ', 5,0001. of gold was taken from the Bank to-day for exportation to the continent. Under these circumstances it is to be expected that the eutire amount brought from Sydney by the John Buiyan will be eent away. Tlelegraphic accountsfrom Constantinople announce tbat the basis of the concession to an English cOliipanly of the privil2ge to establish anImperial National Bi'r:k of Turkey, with exclusive powers of issue, has beeii detinitively arranged. The capital is to be raised in London, Paris, Vienna, and Constantinople, and it is alleged tbat half the required amount 'could immediately be procured in the latter city. Supposing the institution to be formed on legitimate principles, and with sufficient power to create a sound < unenc, it may exert a prin;ary influence on the Jinaicial and commercial regeneration of the country. The recent news from Canton still influences the iea-market. Increased firmness was exhibited this m)orning, and large purchases continue to be nmade, especially in common congou. The precise amount of the shipments of specie by the Peninsular and Oriental steamer Colombo is 4:30,1961., of which 308,6101. is silver for Bomubay, I'laeras, Calcutta, and Singapore, and 119,4951. for Hlongkong, Canton, and Shanghai. The gold is only 2,0917., for Ceylon and Singapore. The further increase of 330,3171. under the head *of Government securities in last week's Bank rtturns is assumed to consist of a portion of the 1,G00,0(0)1. of Exchequer-bills which, according to the revenue statement for the quarter, have been -tab-en by the Bank from the Government. Tbe negotiation which has been for some time in progress with the directors of the General Screw Company for a transfer of their fleet to a new company bas just been satisfactorily concluded. The vesseis to be transferred are eight in number, of an aggregate capacity of 18,000 tons, at a nominal value of about 320,0001., to be paid in sbares. The new company is to be under the sole management of Mr. Croskey, who is to receive no remuneration until the shareholders get 6 per cent.; and the lines to be *occupied are between Bremen and New York, HIavre and New Yozk, and Hamburg and Brazil,Southampton in each ease being the port of call. The following note invites attention to a banking regulation which might, in some cases, lead to serious mnconvenience. It appears that if the suim stated in the body of a check does not agree precisely witlh the firures in the corner it is thie practie of' bankers to refuise payment altogether. There is nothing unreasonable in this, since it is the business of the maker of a check to draw it correctly, and of the receiver to see that it is so drawn; but it may be questioned if it would not be a more desirable, as well as a more strictly legal, practice in such cases *lways to pay the smaller amount. The greater sumn must cover the less, and the banlker, therefore, co0tld incur no responsibility by this course, while, on the other hand, if the holder of such a cbeck were to sustain any loss, either from being temporarily conipelled to suspend payment or through the insolvency of the drawer occurritng before the mistake could be remedied, it would be a matter of un-certainty whether a jury might not be induced to give himn daliages- " London, Jan. 3.

Zwilchenbar, Swiss Consul at this port, for the purpose of instituting a subscription for the wives and families of those at present under arms pending the antidpated war between Prussia and Switzerland. The meeting was held at the Consu's office. Although the ciruolar convening the meeting had been issued bat a few hours about 30 gentlemen were present. Mluch enthusiastic patriotism was manifeited, andupvards of *5001 was at nnce subscribed. The subscription is still open.

THE TBADB OF 1856. Full reports were inserted on Saturday regarding tne course of the cotton, iron, seed, oil, tobacco, chymical, and freight markets during the past year. Subjoined are similar statements in relation to other branches of trade. Jn the wool business, and still more sO in that of silk, it has been a very important period. Messrs. H. Waithman and Co. :report as follows regarding the London trade:- "1 The past year in the silk trade has been one of general prosperity, the principal feature being the very serious jsilure of the European crop, which, wben its full extent legame generaUy known, caused considerable alarm; bat, ff,rtunately, the large increase of imports from Cbina ana India have in a great measure compensated for the European deficiency, and not only enabled us to supply the requirements of our own looms at comparatively moderate pric, but given actj employment to our miUls, and caused both raw and thrown k Ito form a large item in our ex1.orts. Besides the supplies received from this country, it is to be observed that France has also imported to some extent from China and India direct. " Prices of aU classes of silk have during the year experienced a considerable rise; from January to September the market exhibited a continued upward tendency. the total advance on China silk being 6s. to Ss. per lb., while on the finest and best descriptions of Bengal silk an even greater advance was obtainable. About tho middle of September the market received a severe check by the sudden cessation of the continental demand, accompanied by exaggerated reports of the probable supply from China, and prices in con seiquence receded some 2s. 6d. to 3s. per lb., which state of things lasted till November, whenarenewed demand sprang up, hand prices have since returned to within a fraction of " Italian silk has been almost a dead letter, its scarcity and hgh price precluding its use for any purpose vwhere a substitute could be found. "On referring to the following statement, the increased consumption of Asiatic silk will be apparent. In China silks the imports are 58,616 bales, against 51,088 bales in 1855 and the deliveries are 61,684 bales, against 55,66.5 bales in 1855 ; in Bengal silks the imports are 14,078 bales, against 8,210 bales in 1855; and the deliveries are 16,093 bales, against 9,103 bales in 18355; in Italian silk the imports are 2,745 bales, against 2,867 bales in 1855. Showing, in China silk, an increased import of 7,528 bales, and an increased delivery of 6,019 bales; in Bengal silk, an increased import of 5,868 bales, and an increased delivery of 6,990 bales; in Italian silk, a dimiinished import of 122 bales." The course of the LYONS SILK-MARKET is thus described by M. Arles Dufour " In the course of the present year the general silk trade has presented facts deserving serious attention. " As soon as an important deficiency in the silk crop was ascertained prices were pushed so rapidly and so high as to stop, or paralyze business, and, from August to November, the number of looms habitually working for Lyons were reduced to one-half. It was expected that this deficiency in the consumption, combined with the news from China announcing the enormous export of about 80,000 bales, woald cause an important and rapid decline, particularly on Asiatic silk; however, prices receded but very slowly, and in the last fortnight, which was very brisk, tney recovered nearlh all thlat they had lest in the course of four dull "The successive bad crops since 1850 having created a constant scarcity and dearness of European silk our manufacturers were almost compelled to use largely Asiatic silk, and the results have proved so successful that, in future, it will certainly form a permanent and important part of onr stock." - n ato u In relation to FRENCU WINE AND BRANDY flie United Vineyard Proprietors' Company of Cognac state:- "1 This year's produce of wine, in our district, is estimated at something less than half an average crop; and a large portion of that having been taken for the consumption of those districts of the country where there has been a total failure of the vintage, it necessarily follows that the quantity of genuine Cognac brandy to be distilled this year must be small; aid it is to beapprehended that itmay be further reduced by tbose attempts at adulteration which are,too frequently, the consequesce of great scarcity. The stocks of 1855 and older brandlies are very nearly exhaucted, nor can that bh matter of surprise, when it is considered that this is the fifth failing vitage in as many consecutive years. Under these circumstances it may be readily understood that the few really fine brandies, new or old, still in the hands of the farmers, will not be narted with, except at exorbitant rates, which must gradually further advance from time to time as the'real scarcity of fine brandybecomes more and more apparent." WOOL. The annexed is from Messrs. Hughes and Ronald, of Liverpool:- " The wool business dnring the past 12 months has been conducted on a sound footing, and for the greater part of that time has presented a cheerful aspect. In the first few months there was considerable activity, owing to the reduced stocks of all descriptions, and particularly of fine colonial and similar qualities. A fuxrther stimulus was given by the alteration in the French tariff, but the advantage to the French consumers being for the most part of a differential clharacter and favouring direct imports the influence was chiefly felt in fine scoured wools. After the May sales had been a fortnight in progress a sudden and somewhat unforeseen change took place, and a decline upon the opening prices nas established of nearly l.1d. per lb. For more than a month subsequently much inactivitv prevailed, and so great was the gloom hanging over the Yorkshire markets, still further increased by the exaggerated estimate of the quantity to be offered at the next succeeding public sales, that many parties -were induced to clear off their stocks at ruinous prices. The next public sales began on the 17th of July, and realized prices equivalent to the concluding rates of the previous series, tho trade in the meantime presenting no feature of animation. At this period the bulk of the home wools came to market, but under the circumstances tbev engaged less than the usual attention, being attended generaUy with much activity, as it is a rule for growers to give the preference to former Purchasers, who from the fact of their knowing the precise yield of the wools from practical Pxperience would be the more anxious to secure the same clips again. After this demand was satisfied a period of dulness ensued for some weeks, and prices receded from Id. to lAd. per lb., until the genial harvest weather set in in Angust, tel;ich held out a prospect of abundant crops. This han-ngbeen hapily realiued nll branches of trade have fet the effects, and perhaps none more decisivelv than the wool business. O;wing to its sound position, political and monetarvarrangementshave been regarded as of minorimportance. Since August there has been a uniform tendency to advancing prices, which, as regards combing wools of home grovth, have rerceived a rapid and, to some persons in the trade, somewhat unexpected development in the past six weeks, and for all such descriptions the present range of prices is higher than we have seen them since IS34 ! We are by no means prepared to say that this advance is not warranted, for stocks are reduced to such a point as to caue grounds for uneasiness. While consumption has been steadily .nd even rapidly increasing for some years,amply attested by the number of new mills started,-thera has been no corresponding addition to the growth, which ha,been little, f at all, augmented. These remarks apply vnth even greater force to some parts of the continent, where the wer o .consumption has been in a much greater ntio. Th.yare :ecoming our formidable competitors in the markets of she world, even in those departments of tnde , -re formerly British goods stood unrivalled, and it ..re aD our energy to turn the advantages we pos-t. '-, best acoount, and, by putting aside old pre- ., even to retain our present position, with the ad:.onal prospect of the tariff, both in France as well as in America, approximating towards sounder principles of free trade."
.RAIL WAY INTELLIGBCOE. RAILWAYS IN ATTRrPR.AT.-A The Legislature of Neew Soath Wales have passed an act to enable the Governor, with the aid of the Executive Council, " from time to time to raise, by the sales of debentures secured upon the consolidated revenue fund of the colony, and bearing interest at a rate not exceeding 5 per cent. per annUm, such snm orsumsof money, not exceedg200001. as may be required for the carrying on railway works." Contracts have been accepted for providing locomotives. rolliDng stocR, &c., from England for the Melbourne and Williamstorn Railway, also for the supply of 18,000 tons of rails. Tenders have been invited for the suTply of 10,C000 sleepers for the 3Melbourne, Mount Alexander, and MIurray River Railway, and the branch line to Williamstown, and for a tbr2e-rail fence on both sides of the main line for 0 miles from Melbourne. The railway from Melbourne to St. Kilda is being rapidly proceeded with, and the line from Melbourne to Geelong, it is believed, will be opened for traffic throughout in February next. The Geelong and Ballarat line is also reported to be in a forward state. The survey of the North-Eastern line, to connect Mlelboarne, ilumore, Seymour, Benalla, Beechworth, and Belvoir, had been commenced. The construction of the Western line, enubracing Geelonr Ballarat. Ralan, Warrnam. bool, Belfast, Portland, and Mount Gambier (about 250 milea),was intended to be proceeded with during the ensuing summer. The remaining portion of the Geelong and MPel bourne Railway Company's debentures, sent to Sydney, has been taken up at from 5 to 10 premium. TRAFFIC RETURNS.

ST'ATE OF TBADE. MANCHESTERI, Ji,,s. 3. There is a healthy tone about the market, the demand for yarns and cloths being general for most markets, and buyers are anxious to execute the orders in their hands; but the constantly increasing prices forced upon spinners and manufacturers by the upward course of cotton imposes the necessity of caution. The extensive orders on hand keep producers busy, and they are consequently in a better position than ordinary to enforce their owrn terms. The mrat serious aspect of the present position of trade is in the apeprent prospect of supplies, not only of cotton, but the raw materials for the slk and woollen trades, falling short of the demaud. BIRmnNGlAM, JAX. 3. At the usual weekly meeting of ironmasters held in this town on Thursday favo-, able reports were made of the state of the South Staffordshire iron trade ; some branches are particularly active. It had been rumoured for some days previous that an advance of 20s. per ton was contemplated, but, notwithstanding circumstances woould seem to justify an immediate rise, it is understood the leading mnembers of the trade are content to abide by present prices, aLd that the quarterly meetings, which commence at Walsa.llon Tuesday, will pass over without any alteration of the existing trade lists. Pig iroa of best qualities is readily sold, and large sales of hot air mine have taken place at 41. per ton. The stocks are by no means heavy, and the make at the present time is less than for the last two years. The demitani for rails is ou the increase, and gonerally the iron manufacture of Staffordshire and Worcestershire is described to be in a comparatively prosperous state. The coal trade decidedly participates in this improvement. Theincreaseof the quantities xported would appeartoexceed the ratio of iron, and, judging from present demand and the development of steam navigation, coal will before long he classed among the highest figures in the export tables. The domestic demand continues to improve, and, the question of wages being settled, business is pursued vith unusual steadiness., Considering the season of the yeLr, deliveries from the pits have been uiade with great regularity. There is little to be added to the information already given with respect to the gencral manufactures of the town. M1any of the chief establishments are engaged in stocktaking; travellers are at home, arnd principals are preparing for the approacbing quarterly settlemients. The staple manufactures are busy, and orders flow in freely, cansideringthe reluctance to purchase usually shown at this particular period. Some good orders from Australia are iL the hands of thc manufacturers. The intelligence received from the neighbouring manufacturing towns continues to be favourable. The chief establishments engaged in the manufacture of boilers, edged tools, hollow-ware, screws, nails, x3ddlers' ironsnungery, &c., are in good employ, and some of them remarkably busy. The depressed state of the glass trade has been a matter of regret for many months, but, notwithstanding, such is the improvement which is said to have taken place in the manufacture of ornamental descriptions that a company has been established upon the principle of limited liabiiityin Stourbridge which promises to rival in extnt, If not excel in the quality of first-cbla manufacture, any similar establishment in the country. In the coirse of the present week the woll-known firm of Rice, Harris, and Son, manufacturers of glaes in Birmingham, have been declared bankrupts. Their liabilities, it is stated, do not amouint to more than 20,0001. ; but the assets anticipated are insignificantly small' One great and gratifying characteristic of the present Christmas festivities in this town and neighbourhood hlas been the mutual harmony and sociality which have prevailed among masters and men. The decrease of pauperism has also been observable in the public streets and in the densest populated portions of the borough. Workhouse authorities represent that few ablebodied labourers or artisens have sou.cited relief. 0O1mINGUAIM, JAN. 3. The holydays continue to interrupt busineis, but next week will see thenm brouight to a close and active operations resumed. There is an abuindance of work for all classes of operatives, so far as they can be induced to apply themselve3 to it. pot many buyers either of lace or hosicry avoe visited us latterly; hut the orders on hand are heavy for for most kmnds of goods. Prices are firm for all articles, and sonnc are on the .advance. As cotton yarns are again dearer, tbe rates for manufactured goods may oe expected to go up still further. The past year, taken altogether, has been a very prosperous oue. Our manuf3cturcss during that period have been in great demand, and a foundaion has been laid for a still gre.ater development of manuf. cturing and mercantlle prosperity in the future. LEICESTER, JAN. 3. There has not been much doing; the Christmas liolvdays have partly interfered with business, while many of tho manufacturers are engazed in stock taking. lost branches of the trade are dulL Wools continue extremely high, and there is no reason to expect an immediate abatement. LEEDS, JAS. 3. Owing to the morning being wet, and to the fact that just now, at the turn of the year, many nianufacturers and mierchants are balancing their accounts, there was a cociparatively small attendance of both sellers and byvcrs in the cloth-haUs to-day; but thQ tone of the market was firm, and, considering the quantity of suitable goods offered: a fair amount of business was done. A good deal of vhite and other cloth was delivered direct from the manufacturers to the morchants, which is a favourable sign of active trade. Almost aU clAsses of useful cloths, except the very highest quahties made in this district, are in tolerable demand, but fine Meltons, both those which are all wool and those wbich have a cotton warp, and union cloths, of low, mediuns, and fine qualities, are the most saleable. Wools of all descriptions continue to be firm, with an upward tendency in pnce, so that manufacturers are stiff in their demands for the goods they have on hand, while they want an advance on future orders. At present no one anticipates any reduction in the price of wool, for the consumptive demand appears to be gradually getting beyond the supply. The ingenuity of manufacturers, however, is smmeh that there seems scarcely any limit to their introducing material to combino with pure wool, and thereby extend the woollen manufacture. There is indieputable evidence that the woollen trade in this town and district is now active, and that the briskness ma on a sound basis there cam be no doubt, for the stocks on hand are below an average at this season of the year, and there is and has been for some months-in fact, throughout nearly the whole of the p et year, an excellent bome and export trade. The wvooUen nmiDs, the dressing shops, and the dye-houses of the district are busy to a greater exctent than ordinary, and thero aro w manufacturnng operatives out of employment. The prospect of the staple trade of the district is as promising as the retrospect for the p ast year is cheering. HALIFAX, J.us. 3. There is a fair seasonable demand for piece goods, and it is grAduaUy increasing. Plain Orleans and union and worsted dancsaks have lately comusanded good sale. A better demand for yarns is also experienced. Wools continue high in price.
THE LATE DiT. UJRL-Dr. ATdrew I3re was born in Glasgow on the 18th of May, 1778. He studied at tho LTniversity of Glasgow, and subsequently at that of Edinburgh. In the year 180I he was appointed, on the resignation of Dr. Birkbeck, Andersonian Profersor of hbyinistry and Nwatural Philosophy. He was at this time engaged in the eatablishuent of the Glasgow Observatory, where he resided for eome time, and wa; honourod with a visit from the celebrated Sir V. Eiersohel. Ho was eloquent as a lecturcr, and mot sucecssful in his class experiments. In the year 1818 he brought forward hi " Now Exparimental Researches on some of the leading doctrines of Caloric, particularly on the relation betheen the elmticity. temperature, and latent heat of different vapours, and on tbermnometno a,dmneasurenient and capacity," which was read before theRoyal Society. and published in their Transaction for that year. hEr. Ivory, Mr. Daniell, and other philosophers have adopted the conclusions offered in thin paper as the bas. of their metoorological theories. In 1S21. Lppeared the first edition of his well-known Dicionary of GACmistry, which procured him the friendship of Sir H. Davy, Dr. Wollaston, and Dr. E D. Clarke. In 1822 ap - peared his paper " On the Ultimate Analysis of Vegctable Snbstances"in the Plrilosop7hiy Tr an ins. Inthe year 1829 his System of Gcolt,jy was published. In 1835 his Plo.i,oophy of fenanufcturcs followod, and in the followring year his work on the Cotton Mcanufacer,cs of Great Britiin in two volumes. It was the remarkof an eminent machine. maker and engineer that from the minute accuracy of the descriptions and engravings in this work the actual machinesmtght be manufactured without difficulty. Elix next great work was the Dictionary of Artq, Manrufactrres. acd wA incs,-a work of immense labour and research, the last edition of wbich appeared in the year 1852. This work hs been trauslated into the lexding continental languages. Disingnished as a sound ch-mical philosopher, he was no lcss remarkable for aCenracymn chyrnical analysis.

LONDON, MONDAY, JANUARY 5, 1857. By telegraphic despatch from Par.s we receive the news of a terrible crime. The Archlbishop of PARis was assassinated on Saturday evening in the Church of St. Etienne du 3Iont, during a solemn procession, and as he was in the act of entering the sacristy of the church. The assassin was a priest suspended from his functions for some offence. The tragic event is in itself sufficient to fix the attention of the world. An Archbishop slaughtered during a solemn rite of the Church, almost at the foot of the altar, and by the hand of an ecclesiastic, carries us back to former ages and manners different from our own. Perhaps, since the days of A'BoCrrTT there never has been a murder with so many circumstances of romantic and religious horror. For many centuries the clerical order has been shielded from such outrages, either by the respect of the people or by its own inoffensiveness. To strike, much more to take the life of an ecclesiastic, has in aU ages been considered the depth of baseness, and in later times the clergy, deprived of political power, and confined to the discharge of their spiritual duties, have been withdrawn from the hatred of the assassin or the anarcllist. Except during the outburst of the first French Revolution the bishop or the presbyter has been always safe in executing the modest functions of his office. The most depraved or vindictive layman has seldom dared to lift his hands against any of the order; and that a priest should take the life of a bishop is an event for which the Christian world, whether Catholic or Protestant, must be totally unprepared. Yet in this age of refinement and controlled passions we find the revenge bred in one ulcerated heart strong enough to reproduce something similar to the most frightful tragedies of the dark ages. It is indeed a singular fact that two successive Archbishops of PARIS should have met with deaths which the Church of old has deemed martyrdom, and perhaps rewarded with canonization. M. AFFIt was shot at a barricade in June, 1848, while endeavouring to mediate between a furious mob and a no less exasperated soldiery. How much his memory is honoured by the clergy and the religious public of France may be learnt by the numerous portraits and publications whicl.h recall his memory. On his death General CAVAIGNAC conferred the Archiepiscopal see of Paris and the Primacy of France on M. SIBotUR, the bishop of a provincial see. IL SiBouR, it is admitted, did credit to the choice of the Republican Dictator. He has ruled the French Church for more than eight years with temper and discretion. Although undoubtedly belonging to the Ultramontane party in the Church, and carrying his devotion to its doctrines and his belief in its powers to a point beyond that thought necessary by a great body of the French clergy, yet there is no reason to accuse him of intolerance or harshnehs. As is always the case with a man of kindly temper and natural good sense, his acts were not so extreme as his opinions. His primacy has been illustrated by many great events in the history of hlis country, and in all of them he has played a decent and meritorious part. The destruction of the Democratic PRepublic, the establishment of the Presidency for four years, the Coutp d'etat, the Empire, the Russian war, have all taken place while lie filled the ecclesiastical throne of France; and few men have in so short a space of time been called upon to witness so many changes, and to acknowledge so many Governments. He has now, like his predecessor, fallen under the hand of a murderer. He has died in the sanctuary in the performance of his holy duties. In life he had shown himself one of the best and most benevolent prelates of the time, and his death, so striking and so terrible, will not fail to add a crown to his glory.
From the despatches and other correspondence which we published on Friday it is evident that the Chinese quarrel is not so much the result of an accidental conflict of authorities as the expression of a settled animosity on the part of the Government of Canton. To appreciate this position of affairs it must be remembered on what conditions our intercourse with China has been recently maintained. The successes of the last war enabled us to enforce upon the Imperial Govermnent coit- siderable modifications of those outrageous usages by which the jealousy and pride of a barbaric comnmunity were satisfied at the expense of those nations from whose trade they derived a vast portion of their wealth. At certain specified points of territory we secured as respected the adjacent cities such rights of ingress and egress as the occasions of comnmerce required, and obtained relief for the future from those degradations and difficulties which the practice of former times had involved. To these reasonable arrangements, however, an exception was stil preserved in the great city of Canton; not, indeed, in pursuance of a conclusive stipulation to that effect, but in defiance of an actual covenant ultimately made. At first the required permission, though granted in the other cases,v was refused in this, on the alleged ground that the objections entertained to our admission by the populace of the city were too powerful to be surmounted even by an Imperial edict. In this imperfect settlement we acquiesced for a time, but at length, in 184 7, it was definitely promised by the Chinese authorities that at the expiration of two years from that date the interdict sbould be removed and Canton, for lawful purposes, be opened to foreigners. This undertaking, however, was never fulfilled. Under the sarue pretext as before the performance of the engagement was evaded, and the representatives of European trade at Canton remained subjected to the indignities and disabilities which at other points of the coast had been abolished without the smallest damage to the Celestial Empire. It is in these circumstances that the recent outbreak has originated. That there was some truth in the character imputed by the Chinese Government to the city of Canton we are not disposed to doub)t. The implacable bigotry of its population has been evinced on many occasions; the jealousy of foreigners, aggOravated perhaps rather than mitigated by daily contact, nust, of course, have been sharpened by the very success which the resistance either of the people or their governors obtained; and while, on the one hand, Europeans were still confined, like the members of an lnclean caste, to the limits of isolated factories, the authorities of the city could exult in the fact that they had finally triumphed over those forces to which the Celestial Court itself had been forced to succumb. Under such conditions of intercourse it is easy to understand how an explosion occurred, nor will there be much difficulty in comprehending either the obstinacy of the Chinese Governor or the conditions on which Sir MIcHAEL Sxv'uora has resolutely insisted. The infraction of our rights under treaty by the seizure of the men on board the Arrow might or nmight not be a predetermined piece of insolence, but lhe proclamation of Governor YaH at once shows the sentiment uppermost in his mnd by attributing to the " English barbarians," as " their "real object," a desire to gain " admission into "the city." His actual proceedings, too, point to the same conclusion. After such resistance as his pride or obstinacy suggested, he yielded, or pretended to yield, redress in the matter of the Arrow; but he stubbornly refused either to treat with the British Admiral in person, or to grant even such a limited admission to the city as would furnish our official representatives with the means of access to the authorities within. The immediate question, therefore, concerns not sO much our relations with the Government of Pekin as those with the city of Canton. It is obvious, apart from the more general considerations involved, that if the inhabitants of this populous and turbulent town should be able once more to establish the pretensions of their barbaric insolence in the face of suich a practical protest as Admiral SxvirotR has recorded, the security of aU foreigners in those parts would be seriously endangered. One of our correspondents well observed that much more than a mere deference to Oriental usages is implied in this utter exclusion of Europeans from the precincts of a Chinese city. It is impossible to assert that the Chinese, as a people, can have any invincible repugnance to contact or communication with others. On the contrary, we have seen, both in California and Australia, abundant evidence of their aptitude for commercial adventure, and even the more elevated work of colonization; nor is it many days since we reported the erection and consecration of a regular josshouse, or temple, in one of our possessions by tbe Chinese settlers,-a proof, at any rate, that we give them as liberal privileges as we ask ourselves. Nieither can it be now pretended that they entertain any reasonable apprebensions of political encroachments on our part. Not to mention that the required concessions have already been made with entire impunity at other ports more nearly connected than Canton with the capital of the empire, our proceedings after the last war must have shown that trade, and not territory, constituted the object of otur voyages. This trade, too, as we need hardly stop to remark, is in the highest degree beneficial to the Chinese themselves; so that such conditions of intercourse as the Governor and populace of Canton are endeavouring to maintain are totally devoid of warrant. WVe ask for things perfectly reasonable in themselves, and indispensable even to the prevention of quarrels and bloodshed, and it is preposterous to assume that a nation incomparably the stronger of the two should submit to treatment entailing at once a stigma of inferiority and an exposure to constant embarrassment. The inunediate queation, however, is not the only one, nor woil-d it consist either with dignity or prudence to stop short at this point now that the arrangements of former days have been opened for settlement anew. As we can insist with peifect confidence upon the justice as well as the innocence of our requisitions, it is hard to see how we can adopt any better course than one which shaU bring our designs inl their true form to the knowledge of the chief autborities concerned. Whatever may be the violence or bigotry of local governors, it seems impossible to imagine that the supreme Government of China would resolve upon offering wanton indignities to a Power notoriously able in the last resort not only to protect its initerests, but to enforce its will. Our relations, in short, with this singular empire may takle their whole complexion from a direct communication with the rulers of the State, and just as the tribes of Central Africa are represented to be tractable enough if we could but penetrate through the outer circle of population which encloses them, so the Court of Pek-in would probably be found conformable if it could only learn facts from our own representative, instead of r.lying for its information on those whose iterests may lie in distorting or concealing the taath. No doubt, the wilfulness of a provircial governor, if rewarded with fortuitous or temporary success, may now and then be gratifying to Imperial pride, but the ultimate cost of sueh displays is too serious to be approved, nor could an ambassador at Pekin well fail in impressing this conclusion upon the Celestial Court. We have no desire to dictate or interfere ; we should even be relieved in the case before us of any temptation to build up a diplomatic influence. We wish for nothing beyond the power of placing our proceedings in their proper light before a Government whose interests as well as our own are involved in the result, and of relieving both nations for the future from the costly risks of needless and deplorable collisions.
It is an old piece of novel readens' criti5sm that ihe hero should not be too perfect. Mtoraum tst wrarce; if he never nmak-es a miitat.2 amA nevcr exceeds the limits of strict propriety, admiration paIls, and we sleep from the mere excess of approval. A fault here and' there, a slight extravagance or levity now and then, stirs us up and keeps us awake; they are the condiments of the character, that give it a pleasant piquancy and preserve t.he charm of the iUusion. We think of him as a real person, and not a mere model of fiction. Does the same remark apply to a Prime Minister? Wc will not say that it does with I absolute accuracy, because a Prinme Minister is charged with our interests, and therefore the fewer mistakes he mrakes the better it is for us ; there is no charm of illusion to be kept up here, all is desperately reaL Still, the mistakes even of a Prime Minister may sometimes, perhaps, claim the benefit of this rule. Ve wonder, indeed, what he could have been thinking about to make such a mistake. There is no denying the fact that it is a mistake, but the impression, on the whole, is not an unfavourable one, and it is evident that we do not like him much the less for it. A departure from the strict diplomatic model has its charm. We respect the perfect diplomatist who never by any chance opens his mouth when he ought to keep it shut ; still there is something professional about him, nature leans stronigly towards a little friendly gossip, and sympathizes with the error of an easy and genial unguardedness. Why should a man be always thinking that he is a statesman and that he is a great man, and that he must not do anything that other people do.? Is a king always to sit with his crown on? What if a Prime Minister is also a country gentleman, and what if he goes down at Christmas to his country seat, and what if he finds himself casuaUy discussing some morning the electioneering news of the neighbouring town with his tradesman, who has come to him on private business ? What could be more natural ? lVhy may he not express bis opinion about the candidates, as " every man " in the county does 7" It may be bad diplomacy, but why should he be always diplomatizing?9 Though we cannot, then, exactly congratulate Lord PALMERSTON on his Christmas blunder and connect it with the compliments of the season, still we cannot think it necessary to condole with him. He goes dowr to Broadlands, throws off the Premier for a day or two, and is " the Hamp" shire man" with an interest in local nev;s, and especially in the electioneering news of Southampton, about which he talks frecly with his ironmonger from that place. tUnfortunately, while Lord PALM1ERSTON is looking upon himself as the country gentleman, Mlr. LA RNE-swTER is looking upon him as the Prime Minister, and consequently notes dowin his expressions for communication to a meeting of the friends of Mr. WEwI-ELLN, whose clainis the Premier considers superior to those of Mr. AXDRVEws. The Wzt-,uELiX party go about Southampton exulting in the approval of the Prime Minister, and Mr. AxDrITVS writes for an explanation. But it is too late now to retract, and Lord PALMr3rSSTON, though censuring strongly the disclosure of a private conversation, must acknowledge that he has stated his opinion-to which he still adher_s-that Mir. ANnDEWS'S claims to the representrtion of Southampton are not equal to those of MIr. WETaET.IX. But, in small as in great matters, Lord PALMERSTON7 has a way of alwavs falling on his legs, and the confession goes off with an easy swing which damages the plaintiff a good deal more than the defendant. The substance, expressed with perfect courtesy, is, thae Mr. A-,DP.Ews had much better attend to his coachbuilding than aspire to a Parliamentary position ;-better on his own account-better for the public. " Your business "avocations lying in Southampton would inter"fere with your attendance in Parliament, unles "at a great sacrifice of your private interests; "and your habits of thought, as connected "with the nature of your commercial pursuits, "cannot tend so much as those of Mr. WEit7ELIN " to prepare a member for the consideration and "discussion of many of the matters which must "from time to time be dealt with by Parliament." This plain statement of opinion will not probably be very pleasant to MIr. AXI')REVs, who will perhaps regret that, in addition to the fact of the Premier's preference of the rival candidate, he has now elicited so frank a disclosure of the Premier's reasons for it. Few persons have got less by an explanation and a confession than the native candidate for the representation of Southampton, and if Lord PALMrEERSTON has made a nmistake Mlr. ArniREMws has had little benefit from it. We wiU take the Premier's Christmas blunder, then, along with the other festivities of the season-the holly, the Christmas tree, the pantomimes, and the twelfthcakes. It is only in his character of a Hampshire squira that he gives himself these liberties; when he comes up to town again he resumes the 3Minister. These slight temporary digressions from the diplomatic standard are only the natural consequences, in fact, of our Prime Minister's being country genitlemen and going down to their estates and mansions. Cimnr-owrTTscCH and WALE VS1i have not these temptations to political communicative-less; they are diplomatists, and nothing but diplomatists; that is their trade and their station ; they have no "neighbourhoods" to which they go down, and where they find themselves at home and at ease, with country faces about them and local news and local interests discussed. They are therefore not subjected to the relaxing effect of social and friendly associations. But an English statesman, however distinguished, and however battered and worn by political life, is always, in his own idea of himself, the country gentleman quite as mueh as the statesman. He values his country position; lie carries his local interests and his neighbourhood in his thoughts. It is Mlr. MACAULlY'S remark on WARRE;N HASTINos, that after subduing a continent he looked forward as the real prize of life to the renovation of his family estate and his settlement as a country gentleman in Worcestershire. An English public will generally sympathize with a Minister who doffs the statesman in his own neighbourhood, even though it may lead occasionaUy to too much openness, and Lord PAALtSTONN'S uniform success can afford thislittle mistakeasa sacrifice to propitiate the jealousy of Fortune. The prosperous king in the old legend threw a ring into the sea in order that he might not be too fortunate, and so provoke an overthrow from the envious deity, and the Premier is not unlucky if he can secure his own continuance in her favour at the cost of the disappointment of Mr. ANDREWS.
There is a medical as weU as a theological "dodge" for breaking gaol. It would be a pity, however, if a knowledge of the fact should be too widely disseminated among the convicts, for between the two systems it may well be doubted if we should not soon have the majority of the prisoners returned upon our hands to rifle, plunder, and miurder, as their inclinations might dictate. Sir GEORGE GREY is obviously a man of very tender heart. Hc is willing to hope for the best -to receive the paper-money of repentance in place of its solid bullion ; he watches for the convict's ifirst tear, and keeps a finger steadily upon his I pulse, lest the air of a gaol sbould disagree with his constitution. It is quite enough, we say, for Sir GEORGE to receive ass'irance from semie quarter or another that a -p,soner is suffering from a 1)etitc satU, and wY.4:n chicken rcth and calves'- foot jelly have failed ho is ready to recommend change of air and freedom from all unpleasant restraint. Let BILL SYK.E' declar3 upon his honour Rs a gentleman, and upon his veracity as a prig, that ho really can't stand tho " jug" any longer-that he isn't half the man ho was before his personal freedom was tampered with by turnkeys, gaolers, and so forth, and he may be sure of a kind and attentivo hearing at the Home-office, On tho whole, it must be rather a curiouis and interesting subject of speculation among our convicts at the present time whether it be better worth while to aim at liberation througlh the chaplain or the doctor. The process by means of the former functionary might, as we should have thought, be considered the safer of the two. Doctors, when they suspect a sham, have an awkward way of shaving a man's head and applying largo blisters, to make no mention of their nauseous compounds, which must, of course, be swaUowed as a test of sincerity. We should have decidedly tried the chaplain, but by the case of GFoRGE HoLNrFnS, who has recently contrived to procure his liberation from York Castle on medical grounds, it appears that we should have been in the wrong, as far as that fastness is concerned. There is, in fact, no general rule to be laid down on the subject;-in some gaols Mvir. FAc.rI would recommend you to try the chaplain, in others to have recourse to tho doctor. It is purely a question of individual character, and the decision may fairly be left in every case to the discretion of the gentleman who is principally interested in the result of the experiment. This poor invalid, GEorGE Hotuin91, is described in the local journals as " the " terror of the neighbourhood, in wbich he had long " resided ;"-he was suspected of the murder of Mrs. MIlIonrT. A few days after the murder, inthe immediate neighbourhood of the spot where that murder had been committed, this worthy creature " met in "broad daylight a child travelling on the high road. "He dragged her up a dark lane, brutaUy assaulted "her, and then robbed her." Strangely enouglh, the sentence pronounced upon tilis abominable ruffian was one of imprisonment for only two years. It was pronounced by a barrister who was acting as judge for the day, to the very general disgust of aU who heard it. wVell, GEorGE RoiNFs was consigned to York Castle, but as soon as he found himself within the walls of that building his formerly robust health began to decline apace. There was, no doubt, a craving after his accustomed beershop and the other little excitements in which his heart delighted. His liver was affected, and then his lungs, and he contrived to make out so good a story to the doctor, and the doctor to the Visiting Justices, and the Visiting Justices to the HOIME SECRETARY, that in five months' time he procured his freedom. Chlange of air and liberty were the two indispensable conditions forpreserving to society one of its brightest ornaments in the person of GEoRGE HoLnvs. The Governor gave him some moncy, and, no doubt, every care was taken that the interesting convalescent should be provided with every little comfort his situation might require. Away he went, and we hear of hini in a very few days at a beersbop, where lie was given into custody for endeavouring to pass away a bad halfcrown. The defence of GFxOaIo HoUNErEs upon this occasion was that the bad halferown had been given to him by the gaoler at York ;--cuaodcs sell fepd. ? Wle are pleased to see in this instance at least that the authorities had not gone through the form of presenting their protf676 with that most idle of all documents, a ticket-of-leave. But may we not with such a story before us well pause, and wonder wlhat is to become of the coumtry if the sentences pronounced by the Judges are not to be carried into effect, if prisoners can with so little pains procure the entire remission of penalties which were in the first instance inadequate to their grievous offences against their fellows .7 Here is more murder, more rape, more robbery let loose upon society in the person of this scoundrel, simply because the Visiting Justices at York were pleased to declare that his state of health reqiuired change of air, and Sir GEORaE GREY was weak enough to heed their representations. W -e trust the public opinion of their neighbourhood may do justie* upon these Yorkshire gentlemen, who are certaiizly unfitted for the office they hold, unless they can bring somewhat more of firmness to its execution. They are not appointed to take care of the prisoners only, anm to see to their little comforts ; it is their chief duty to guard the district cor.mitted to their cllarge from violence and outrage.

LATEST INTELLIGENCE. MURD ER OF THE ARCHISHOP OF PARIS. (BY SUBMtURTXE AND BRI'TT.$ TET.EGRAPL.) We have received the following telegraphic despatch from our Paris correspondent:- " PARIS, SUNDAY MORNING. "A horrible crime was committed yesterday afternoon, at 5 o'clock, in the Church of St. Etiennedu-Mont, during a procession in honour of St. Genevieve. " At the moment the Archbishop of Paris entered the vestry he was stabbed with a dagger by a priest named \'erges, who had been recently suspended. " The Archbishop was carried to the presbytery of St. BFticnne-du-Mont, where he almost immediately e-xpired. " The murderer was arrested. He confesses his Crime. He is about 30 years of age. "This crime has produced the most painful sensation throughout Paris." The Mom4teur of yesterday announces the murder of the Archbishop of Paris in the same terms as our telegraphic despatch, adding It is impossible for us to describe the deep emotion felt by the numerous faithful u-ho were assembled in the church, and the painful impression which the news of the death of the virtuous prelate caused that evening in Paris."

This morld contained in one mass the eiigine-bottom, including two condensers, two chanibers to receive the air-pumnps, as well as feed and bilge pullnps, and pillow block for main shafts. The length of the imars whichl had to be cast was 24 feet 6 inches ; the breadth 10 feet 6 inches, asid the height 'J feet. The cast. ing, wlieii takeis fromii the mould in the course of six or seven days, will be 47 tons 10 cwt.-the largest casting, as far as is known, ever made in the world. Let our readers magme, if they can, two huge cupolas, employed from 7 in the morning until 3 in the afternoon melting pig iron in small portions of from fosrz to sis tons at a tinse, which had ts he occasionally removed in monstrous frane-carried iadles to a hot air receptacle, to be ready for running into the huge anld cavernous mould. I,et them iuaagine the great shied of Finnieston Works filled with ansions Titans, with long iron rods in hand. Let them suppose Mr. John Neilsoii, caliii and inimovable as another Colossus, standing beside a canal of two feet wide, and as sany deep, through which the iuid iron must run, and al is ready for the grand work-the casting. MEr. Neilson speaks in low but decisive tones-the cauldron of fluid iron is tapped, and forth pours the dazzlingv stream of melted iron, while at the same time a crowd of workmen at either end of the foundry stand beside lige ladles, each containing about six tons of melted maetal, ready to fill up any crevice which may not have reeived a supply from the receptacle we have already named. Thie word is given, and on pours the stream ; and no sooner has it begun to fill the mould than forth rush volumes of inflammable gas from a thick forest of iron tubes wlich are studded over the surface of the earth which covers the mould. The workmen to whom we have referred apply their white hot rods of iron to these ventages, and instantly there blazes forth a mass of light blue flamiie-the conibustible gas which is thrown off from the moull by the immense mass of molten iron which bubbles and heaves below. This done, a crowd of men commence poking their iron rods among the mass of iron in the mould by openings left for that purpose. By this process they allow air to escape, and ascertain whether the melted iron ia filled all tie crevices of the mould. Let our readerri'¢iiagine this mass o' iron thrown into the mould, 0 tons i1n all, pouring in a torrent which is exbausted in one minute 45 seconds, and they will have some idea of a work whlich all the iron workers in England refused, the lke of whlich none of the ironmasters in England ever saw, and which was accomplished under the superintendence of Mr. John Nelson, on Tuesday, December 30, 1856. We have only further to add, that this is the second casting of the same kind in the same work, and the engines for v.hiCh it was east are to be fitted up for the new Australian line of steam-vessels.-Ga-3fOsg Hecrald. DEATH OF SIGNOR CRVvELLI.-It is with deep regret that we have to announce the death of Signior Crivelli, which took place on Wednesday last, Dec. 31, at his residence, 71, Upper Norton-street, Portland-place. Signor Crivelli came to i,ngland in the year 1817, with his father, who was enga-ed as the principal tenor at the King's Theatre. Since that tnme he dedicated himself to the profession of 'eaching singing, and directly acquired a great name, whivea he maintained with increasing reputation up to the moment of his death. Since the foundation of the Royal Academy of Music, in 1S23. he has been the principal professor of singing at that institution, and almost aU our present singers have been his pupils. Signor Crivelli has also writteni a method -f singing, L'Arte del Canto,which isconsideredtho best work extaant. He leaves behinid him a celebrated name in the pr. fession, and he was beloved and esthemed by all who knew him.
YOBEIGN INTEBLLINCB. FRANCE. (FROM OUR OWN COBRBESPONDZ1i.) | (A portton of the following appeared ia our seoond I dition of Saturdq -] PARIS, FRIDAY, 6 P.AL The following private telegraphic despatches have been received:- "BERNE, J.Ax. L "The trial of the prisoners at Neuchittel is fixed for tho 19th inst. A deputation from the Royalists of NeuchAtel have proceeded to Berlin to pray that there shall be no war. "The reports of an Anglo-French mediation are becoming more frequent. The hopes of peace are maintained. Considerable offers of money are made. " The Council of State has adopted unanimously the decisions of the National Assembly. The Federal Assembly in its sitting of last evening appointed General Dufour Commander-in-Chief of the Federal army, and M. Freyherone Chief of the Staff. The President of the National Assenbly delivered a speech, which prodluced considerable impression. General Dafour has taken the customary oathsThe Federal Assembly will meet three times more." Colonel Barmann, Minister of the Swiss Confederation in Paris, returned this morning from his visit to Berne. He was to have presented to the French Minister for Foreign Affairs in the course of the afternoon a communication from his Government. Of the particulars of this communication I know nothing, but I have some reason to believe that it will contain the definitive resolution of the Federal Council, and the last concessions it is disposed to make to Prussia. It is certain that the basis of the arraingement which Switzerland had already admitted remained uinuhanged, and I doubt whether even now it is materially modiied. Nevertheless it is certain that a pacific arrangement is probable. The Emperor will soon be made acquainted with the result of Colonel Barmann's mission, and with the utmost that the Confederation will gralnt and the good offices of England and France will do the rest. No Conference was held to-day. A new difficulty is said to have occurred respecting the compensation to be given to Russia. The pri'ciple, it is said, was admitted, but a difference arose on the details, and it is found necessary to refer to the Limitation Conuaission, and again to the Governments. Of couirse, until that difficulty is removed, and, indeed, all others, the English fleet will not quit the Black Sea, and the Austrians will not evacuate the Principalities. There is but one Russian Plenipotentiary at the Congress,Baron Brunow. CountKisseleff is only an " outsider." It is said the Emperor, at the receptions yesterday, expressed to M. Kisseleff the satisfaction he felt at the " moderation" of his Government. It is not known whether a Conference will be held to-morrow. A private letter froin Athens, dated the 20th ult., speaks of a communication from Mr. Vyse, the English Minister, to the Greek Minister for Foreign Affairs. It seems that Mr. Wyse had, like the other foreign Mlinisters, received an official invitation to attend at the opening of the Greek Parliament by the King in person. The spectacle could hardly be of an imposing character, as comparatively few of the deputies were present. If I can give credence to the private letter alluded to, Mr4.iWyse, while acknowledging the receipt of the letter of invitation, declared that, as the representative of tlze oldest and greatest constitutional Power in Europe, he could not attend the inauguration of a Parliament formed under the most flagrant violation of the institutions of the country; that for several years consecutively he had had occasion to protest against the violation by the Government of His Hellenic Majesty of the constitution which the Greek nation had unanimously given itself; that at the present moment he eagerly embraced the opportunity offered him of once more protesting, and of recapitulating all that he had previously said on the inalversations and immorality of thefunctionaries whom the Greek Government seemed to consider it an obligation to select, as also against the system, so long practised, of governing a nation despotically with the forms of a constitution. For these and other reasons he (Mr. Wyse) thought it becoming to his dignity, as the representative of Great Britain, to abstain from witnessing the opening of such a Parliament as the present. Mr. Wyse's communication was of some length but the writer of the letter I refer to states thatethe foregoing contains the substance and pith of it; and that the absence of the British Minister on the occaIsion produced muchgreater sensation at Athens than did the presence of King Otho or his speech from tile throne. "The public" adds the writer, " admits the truth, and eulogizes the frankness and sincerity of the English Minister." It appears that the very day before the opening of Parliament, and when the King was aboutto congratulatethecountry on the extinction of brigandage, M. Pota (a Bavarian), with two soldiers, who attended him, was captured by a band of robbers near Lanice ; and they now demand a ransom for their liberation. A letter from Canea, the capital of the island of Candia, published in the Mfoniteses, informs us that the quantity of spun silk produced in that island during the year 1856 was much inferior to that of 1855. It is estimated that the last crop will not e.xceed 15,335 kilogrammes. Spun silk was worth in July last 250 piastes the oke (the Turkish piastre is equal to 2.d., and the oke of Candia is 2ilb.) but, the article having risen in Europe, the price rose in Candia to 280 piastres. It is now quoted at 265 piastres. The Candian silk carefully spun is of very fine quality, but that spun by the peasants is very inferior. The receipts of the Orleans Railway Company for the week ending the 22d December amount to 1,215,432f., being an increase, as compared with the corresponding week of the year 1855, of 246,288f. 5oc.

The delay is attributed to the English and Austrian Plenipotentiaries not being prepared to announce the evacuation of the Danubian Principalities and of the Black Sea inunediately after the signing of the protocols. There is no doubt that Russia accepts the new proposition, and gives up Bolgrad and the Isle of Serpents; but Austria and England insist that, in order to avoid all future misunderstanding, the new line of Russian frontier shaU be verified on the spot by the Commissioners, and they declare that the evacuation cannot take place until that is done. Owing to the state of the ground, in consequence of the bad weather, it is calculated that this verification will not be completed before two months. It is also said that Austria objects to evacuate the principalities -until they are organized, and that any diflicuilties on the part of the Porte will be removed. It is hinted that the English Government will make the most of the time allowed themn before the evacuation of the Black Sea to finish the quarrel with Persia. It does not necessarily folow that the protocols will not be signed before the evacuation. The Congress meets solely to settle the limitation question, and not to discuss the evacuation, so that the protocols may be signed i2mediately. The next day of meeting is not knorn; instructions must come from Lonrdon andVienna, and the Plenipotentiar.es will receive the usual summons at their respective residenceswhen all is ready. The Persian Envoy, who was expected to embark at Constantinople on the 22d, is instructed to treat directly with the English Government. The reception at the Tuileries last night is said to have been unusually magnificent. The Emperor conversed a good while with the Prussian Ambassador on the Swiss question, and I may assure you that a pacific settlement between Switzerland and. Prussia is oven more certain than when I wrote last. (elond Barmiann had an audience.e the Emnpezr tQ-da4y, with Al, Wslewki5 and the last resolves of the Federal Council were communicated.

The pressure of political and diplomatic affairs, however great, has not prevented the Grand Vizier from bestowing his attention on the pending schemes for the material development of the coumtry. Indeed, a very superficial knowledge of Turkey and the daily increasing financial embarrassments of the Government would have been sufficient to point out the necessity of doing something in this respect. Even the late Ministry was aware of this, and took up the matter with unusual zeal. Unfortunately, the novelty of the thing, a complete ignorance of the subject, and certain official traditions which identify rather too nuch the interests of the country with those of the ernployes themselves, were by no means favourable to the growth and maturing of such schemes, and, with the exception of the railway project from Smyrna to Aidin, for which the firman has been issued, everything else remains to be done. When, after the conclusionof peace, European capital began to seek for investment in Turkey, the very eagerness which was shown in the beginning created the idea among the Turks that the Europeans by some kind of Aladdin's lamp musthave discoveredc large treasures in their country, of which they themselves knew nothing. The first impulse was to take unlimited advantage of this, and every scheme which presented itself was received and discussed. This first enthusiasm soon gave way to a just as much exeaggerated feeling of suspicion. They found out, by looking nearer at the subject, that besides their sympathy for Turkey, the capitalists were in the first instance anxious to secure their own interests aud they took to a regulaa Eastern bargaining, of which the principle is, that one party cheats and the other is cheated. This narrow-minded bargaining would have been excusable had it been done wvith a knowledge of the necessity and advantages of the different schemes, but this was not the case. Instead of following something like a system, and inquiring what ougwht to be done first, all schemes were taken up indiscriminately; even in a country which is industrially highly developed such a wild goose chase at improvementswouldbe attendedwith inconvenience; how much more must this be the case in a country where everything is to be created, where the initiative must entirely come from the Goamrnment, and where the latter is expected to pay for it? In most of the schemes inder consideration the Turkish Government is asked for a guarantee. In principle there is nothing to be said against guarantees-frst, because without them it is not Iikely that many capitalists will undertake anything in T'urkey, and because guarantees are less objectionable here than anywhere else ; indeed, if judiciously applied, they must lead to a certain in crease of the rcvenue. This would, above all, take place from the construction of a net of railways, for the tithe being the chief tax, and this being taken by the Government in mmzturd, the rise in the price of the produce in the interior and the increase of production itself, which would be the natural consequence of a cheapness and facility of communication, would ultimately more than compensate the Turkish Government for the outlay in guarantees. But it ought to be remembered that years must elapse before this result will be felt, and in the mean time the Government will have to advance the guarantees out of its own means. Before thus promising guarantees the Turkish Government would do well to consider whether in the present state of its finances it will be capable of performing these promises. I am afraid neither the Turkish CGovernment nor the companies who ask for the concession of railways have given a due attention to the subject. Half-a-dozen railway schemes, requiring an outlay of 12,000,000 to 15,000,000 of money, have been before the Ministerial Council for the last seven months, and this at a time when the Turkish Government is continually compelled to find small loans to satisfy the necessities of the moment, and to pledge for the payment of the interest the revenues of one or other province; besides this, the interest of the first large loan in Europe is guaranteed on certain custom-house dues, and that of the second absorbs the tribute of Egypt and of the Danubian Principalities, and all this out of a revenue which scarcely exceeds 6,000,0001. sterling. To talk therefore of guarantees for railways or any other undertakings before something has been done to regulate the finances is labouring under a gross delusion. But, leaving even such schemes out of the question, it is high time that the Turkish Government should come to a decision on the financial measures to be taken, for nothing surely is nmore calculated to undermiine the credit of the Government and exhaust the means of the country than a series of small loans of 80,0001. or 100,0001., undertaken without a plan or system, and necessarily at a heavy interest. As it is, Turkish credit in Europe iv so far gone, that if the Government were to try on its own responsibility to negotiate a larger loan in Europe, and thus to get out of the present crisis, ii could scarcely be done even at a heavy sacrifice. The Grand Vizier seems to have understood that before embarking in large schemes for the material development of the countryit isnecessaryto establish a basis, and, with this view, he urges, first of all, the establishment of the longe-talked-of National Bank. The affair has been, as you know, for some months past in the hands of a.commission apecially appointed for that purpose, but hitherto nothing has been done except contracting small loans with one or otlier of the rival companies; and they have, so far, been treated with equal consideration. Now, however, if I. am rightly informed, positive orders have been issued to terminate these transaetions within a certain time. You are aware that there are four companies in the field: the Ottoman Bank, representing AngloFrenchinterests; theproject of Messrs. Wiltshire, purely English, and supported by several of the arge contracting firms; the house of Rothschild; and the association of native bankers. As to the conditions, there is very little material difference between the offers of tho 'competitors, and, even if there were, in the establishment of an institution of such vital importance for Turkey it is not so much any momentary advantages which ought to decide, as the consideration which ef the competitors is most likely to carry out the whole object in view. In order to do this, the company which obtains the privilege must identify itself entirely with the interests of the country, for, as it will necessarily exert considerable influence not only on all financial transactions of the Government, but likewise on the whole industrial and commercial development of the country, Turkey has at least the right to ask that her interests should not be sacrificed to other considerations. The native association seems at first sight to offer the gr ratest guarantee for this condition, being exclusively composed of local bankers, who have almrost all their fortunes engaged in the country. Bl-st, instead of identifying their interest with f;hose of Turkey, these same native banklers have for ! years paet given the most evident proofi tlai t 4ey consider this country only as their rightful spoil. They are more strangers to it than any new comers. Born aud bred in the country, their first thought is to shake off their allegiance, and become the protMg&s of some foreign Power, being thus exempt from all taxes on their ill-gotten gains. Can it now be expected that these people associating together should forget the traditions of a life, and suddenly take to heart the interests of Turkey? Wil they put an end to the bad practices and financial confusion which they themselves have, if not created, at least powe"ful1y promoted? The necessity of the future bank's identifying its own iaterests as much as possible with those of Turkey seems likewise to militate against the project of the house of Rothschild. No doubt the advantages which this house could offer in any negotiations for loans and railways are great, but it is just this greatness which creates the danger, lest the Turkish National Bank should becomae only a branch of the house of Rothschild, and, instead of being national and independent, should faU into a servitude which woould be worse than the worst state of financial anarchy. It would be nothing more nor less than opening the door to the influence of a new great European Power, and it ought to be supposed that the Turks have enough to do with those already established in their country. As each of the rival compoanies has its influence in the councils, and as, moreover, suspicion will not fail to comment on the decision, whichever of the competitors should succeed, Redschid Pasha is rather in an awkward position. Ile wants to avoid anything lik-e showina a personal predilection, and yet, in his position as Grand Vizier, he wil have to decide ultimately, unless he leave the decision on such an important matter to a council packed expressly for the purpose by his predecessors and adversaries. The plan is, I believe, to bring forward another proiect of the Government, which will be offered to competition. It may be doubted whether this will be the safest and most expeditious way of coming to an understanding, for either the conditionswill be again such as nobody wiU accept, or else, if acceptable, aU will accept them, and then a choice must be made. In the meantime, the Government has contracted a loan of 80,0001. with the Ottoman Bank. This transaction deserves notice, not so much for the amount as because it is the first bond fide business transaction in which the Turkish Government has, very likely, ever been engaged, and decidedly the first in which a straightforward ,European way of dealing has gained by its own strength the upper hand. The usual way in such small loans is that the Government applies to one or other of the native bankers, and tries to get the best terms it can. This was the beginning in this transaction too. MIr. Falconet, the chief manager of the Ottoman Bank-, latelv arrived, was caUed on and asked for the loan. As usual, secrecy was promised, but in this instance not kept, and two other native houses were not only informed of the loan itself but even of the general conditions. But, as these were drawn up according to European (not Galata) calculations, both the other houses declared the terms impossible. Thus the Ottoman Bank remained alone in the field. If this was in itself calculated to show the difference between the European and native way of doing business, this difference became even more striking in the regulation of the details. The loan was at first to be paid in in monthly instalments, extending over three months, but whenit came to a discussion of details Ali Ghalib Pasha, who was charged with the transaction, extended the perfod for the payment to seven instead of three months. At this concession, of the importance of which the Turkish Mlinister seemed scarcely aware, Mir. Falconet immediately lowered his terms without being asked, causing naturaUly no small astonishment to the functionary, who most probably never had a transaction in -which he was honestly treated. When the two native houses saw that the business -was concluded, against their prediction, they went to complain to the Grand Vizrer against the transaction as a most pernicious one; fortunately, the Grand Vizier, after inquiring into the matter, was easily convinced of the contrary, and the loan was concluded. Thwarted thus in their schemes, the native bankers hoped to make the Ottoman Bank pay on the Exchange for the advantage it had gamed with the Government, and np went the exchange several piastres. But they soon found out that even on 'Change Europeans are sometimnes a match for Galata, for what was their astonishmentto find that, instead of selling, the Ottoman Bank bought; measures had been already taken to make the bank entirely independent of the whims of the GalataExchange. The whole transaction,when it transpired, had the effect of raising the Ottoman Bank considerably in the eyes of the merebauts,who from one or two former mistakes in the direction had rather lost confidence in it. A European establiahment had of course to expect great opposition from the clique of native bankers. Everybody acknowledged its honesty but the question was, whether it would be a match for native sharpness. The late transaction gave a very good proof of this. One or two such ceups, for which the opportunity will not fail, wil be sufficient to pls e beyond doubt that systematic business transactions, according to European principles, must always get the better of simple cunning. AUSTRIA. (FROM OUR OWN- CORRiEpONNT.) VIENNA, Dzc. 3L Colonel von Manteuffel, the diplomatic courier of His Majesty the King of Prussia, arrived here last night, and purposes leaving for Venice this evening. The Colonel, who is said to be the bearer of an autograph letter from his Sovereign to tbe Emperor Francis Joseph, had a long interview with the Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning. Of course, nothing positive is as yet known respecting M. von Manteuffe's mission, but it is believed to be in some way connected with an Austrian despatch in answer to the Prussian note of the 8th. It is credibly stated that the Austrian Government fully recognized the sovereign rights of the King of Prussia in Neuch&tel, and promised to do aU in its power +, obtain the liberation of the Royalist prisoners. A compliment was paid to the Berlin Cabinet for the moderation which it had displayed, and it was suggested that a collective note addressed to the Federal Government by the parties to the London protocol of 1852 might induce the Swiss to listen to the demands of His Prussian Majesty. Since the Austrian despatch was written (probably on the 18th) the Neuchatel question has made considerable progress, but the warlike ardour of Eing Frederick William is said to abate in the same proportion as that of the Swviss increases. Be this as it may, it is certain that His Majesty would like to effect a compromise, and it is probable that he has now coramunicated his Tiews on the subject to his Imperial nephew. His Prussian Majesty affects a vast deal of bondhommie; but, as he is extremely jealous of his dignity, the expression of the Xoniteur, " La defeenc courtoise de la PnsZse" was as little to his taste as it was to the taste of his subjects. It has produced an extremely disagreeable impression on the smaller German Governments that Prussia has treated separately with Bpden, Wurtemberg, and Bavaria for the passage of her troops, instead of applying for the permission of the Bund. If the second and third rate German potentates were not gifted with a greater share of simplicity than their fellow-rmortals, they would long since have come to the conclusion that the autho- rity ot the Bund is only recognized when it suits the purposes of one or other of the two great Powers. If Austria had raised any objection to the march of Prussian troops through Baden, Wurtemberg, and Bavaria, Prussia would of course have appealed to the German Diet; but, as the Imperial Government approved the policy of the Berlin Cabinet, the latter has not even taken the trouble to announce its intention to the Patres Comscriptiat Frankfort. The followinog is a summary of some halfdozen letters which have been received by the Bavarian and Frankfort papers from Switzerland-.- On Sunday last, the 24th, 40,000 men were already posted on the frontiers of Basle and Schaffhausen, and on the following Tuesday 140,000 men had announced to the cantonal authorities that they were on their wvay to the posts which had been assigned to them. The frontiers towards all the conterminousStates are strictlyguiarded, excepting those towards Austria. The inhabitantsof Tessin knowthat duing this season of the year they have little or nothing to fear from their formidable neighbours, and the Austrimans themselves confess that during the winter months it would be sheer madness to attempt to enter the mountainous parts of Switzerland. On the 24th all the higher pubEc schools in Switzerland were closed, and it was settled that they should not be ropened until the storm hau Uwwn over. IA the evening of the s&im day the students of Zurich had formed a free corps, and the young people in the other canhons have since followed their example. " Switzerla.nd is in no want of men of whom to form a powerfu.7 army, but there is a great dearth of officers, as the authorities will not accept the proffered services of the so-called ' Emigration."' The horses which are to be used for the artillery in Zurich, Thurgau, Basle, Aargau, and Schaffhausen are to be kept in constant readiness for service. " Altbough the wealthy manufactiirers and merchants declare that peace is the greatest of blessings, their patriotism is such that almost aU of them have offered to do military service." On the 27th several complete battalions and corps of riflemen, which were on their way from Appenzell and St. GaU to Schaffhausen and Stein, arrived by railroad at Winterthur, but they only remained there a couple of hours, so itnpatient were they to reach their destination. The Swiss are buying up very large quantities of corn and other necessaries of life, as they foresee that their neighbours wiUl indirectly assist Prussia by blockading their frontiers and cutting them off from aU communication with the outer world. Great activity prevails in the arsenals, and many new telegraphic lines are being constructed, but the Swiss are not fond of doing things in a hurry, and consequently they set about their work as calmly and systematically as if they had no enemy to fear. It is universally allowed by the Swiss that the Prussiam are excellent soldiers, but still they seem full of confidence. " There is no rodomontading, but every single Swiss seems to have a feeling that the eyes of the world are on him, and that it is his duty to assist in maintaining the high reputation for bravery which his felow-countrymen have always borne." Nothing is known to the Borne Government of the movements of the inhabitants of Tessin, as the snow on the bt. Gothard completely interrupts the communication. In a secret conclave, held at Rome on the 15th inst. the state of the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico, South America, and Switzerland was taken into consideration, and an allocution since published by His Holiness on the subject clearly shows that the Papal influence is considerably less in those countries than in this. The Pope complains bitterly of the new Government of Mexico, which has completely set aside the ecclesiastical jurisdiction and sequestrated the property of the Church. We are told that the monastic establishments have refused to permit the "visitation" of the bishops, and that some of them have, in open defiance of the canonical laws, sold part of their property. The peruission given by the Government to all sects publicly to practise their religious rites is denounced as " an abominable measure, which is calculated to undermine the most ho,y Roman Catholic religion." After summing up the various backslidings of the Mexican Government, His Holiness declares aU the measures which it has taken against the authority of the Apostolic Chair to be null and void. The Mexican statesmen are also reminded that the Church has tha power severely to punish those persons who disobey her behests. The state of Switzerland makes Pius IX. quite disconsolate, " so numerous are the encroacbments of the civil authorities on the rights of the Church, and of her bishops and servants." After hurling his thunders at those priests who obey the laws of the countries in which they live rather than the instructions forwarded to them from Rome, the Holy Father entreats the Most High to enlighten the mmnds of men, and to bring back those who have gone astray into the right path. As a matter of course the Wiener Zeitimnq gives the allocution in extnsso, although it is a very lengthy document. SWITZERLAND. A letter from BeUinzona, of the 29th ult., states that there are 20,000 Swiss troops marching to the frontiers in the direction of the Rhine: 50,000 have responded to the appeal of the nation. The entire Federal army is ready-the drum and trumpet resound through the cantons-the arsenals are busy, and camps for drilling the troops are being formed. The hymn of war finds an echo in the valleys. Zurich imitates the example of Berne in unanimously voting an unlimited credit. Militiamen, full of energy, spring up in the cantons of SchWytz, Uri, anct Vaud, and offer 15 -battalions above their federal contingent. There is no longer any controversy in thejoiurnals, but everywhere this cry" Neucbo.tel is S wiss and must remain Swiss. The Swiss nation forms but a single man-a single heart." A letter from Berno, of the 28th ult., gives some details concerning the late attempt at arrangement made there by the diplomatic corps:- " Mr. Fay, the American Charg6 d'Affxircs, and Mr. Gordon, the English Ainister, assnmed the initiative in endeavonring, for the last time, to see whether it were not possible to bring about an arrangement and avoid * disastrorm war. To that end Mr. Fay invited his coleagues of tbe diplomatic body to meet at tho Hotel de la Couronno. Every one entered heartily en this diflicult task, and finisbod by drawing up a plan of arrangement to be .submitted to the Federal Council and to Prussia. According to this project, tho Federal Council was to engago to propose to the Federal Assembly the reloese of the prisoners; and the diplomatists in the name of the Powers of which they were the representatives on their part engaged to interpose their good offices with the King of Prussia, to solve the Neuch'ltel question according to the wishes and desires of Switzerland. This project was communicated to 31. Stzempfli by Mr. Fay and Mr. Gordon. M. Staimpfli, not finding in it sufficient guarantees, required that it should be expressly said that the Confederation. 'in the exercise of its sovereignty,' consented to release the prisoners; and that it should be added th%t the Powers would interpose their good offices 'to obtain the cession of NeuchilteL' Tho diplomatists yielded, although some of them loudly declared that such a wording of the project would not be signed by their respective Courts. In the end the project was accepted on both sides, but, as the diplomatists had not instructions ad hoc, they vere obliged to apply for the ratification of it from their respective Courts The BelgianMinister, whodoesnotappearto have anycipher would not tmrus to the Swiss telegraph, and set off for the French frontier, in order to correspond with his Govern ment by the French line. HIu sudden departure gave rise to a rumour that he had left for Berlin on a mission from the diplomatic body. At last the replies came one after the other, but I am only aware of part of them. Belgium refused to interfere in the matter, and Russia, Austria, and France formally refused their signatures. Tho despatch of Count Walewski to M. de Salignac Fendon still gives some hopes of maintaining peace. If I am well informed, it was as folows:-' You will not sign the declaration; we maintain our propositions, and we reproduce them to the Swiv Parliament; the other Powers are at liberty to join in them.'" An article in the New Gazct of Zurich expre5es its regret that Prussia should have broken off diplomatic relations in so abrupt a manner, since the question at issue has now been placed in the hands of third parties, who, with the best will in the world, have rather added to its complications than facilitated a solution. It says - "The King of Prussia cau hope for nothing elso than the release of the prisoners, and in order to obtain that result he has only to renouncoe his character of the John Lackland of NeucbtteL The King of Prussia, any more than Switzerland, has nothing to expect from the good offices of diplomacy. But sincoe the arrival of M. Barmann the following solution appears to possess some chance of success:-' Switzerland will release tho Royalist prisoners in virtue of her sovereignty; and, on the other hand, the Powers offer their good offices to obtain from Prussia the renunciation of her rights on NenchtsteL Swit7erland will be at liberty to choose the offices of all the Powers, or of only one or two of them.' This solution meets the views of Franoe, England, And the United States, and is tantamount to what Switzerland has claimed since the commencement of the difficulty." The following are some details relative to the respective functions of the political bodies now sitting at Berne to protect the interests of the Helvetic Confederation .-The sovereign power resides in two councils, the national one and that of the States. The former is compoeed of deputies of the Swiss people, in the proportion of one for every 20,000 souls. The number of members is ]20, who are elected for three years by universal suffrage, every citi7en who has attained the age of 20 having a vote. The Council of the States is composed of 44 members, two from each canton. The two Councils form together the legal representation of the Confederation, under the name of the Federal Assembly. This body, svhich holds an ordinary session every year, and extraordinary ones when called for by circumstances, is sovereign on all questions oE general interest, political laws, f;nances, police, military organization, and revision or moditication of the Constitution. Next comes the executive power, -which bears the name of the Federal Council, and which is composed of seven members elected for three years by the I Federal Assembly, and chosen without distinction frota amoug all Swims citizens, with this xiul& r- striction, tbat no two of the members can belong to the same canton. The Federal Council is charged with the internal administration and with the direction of the foreign relations of the Confederation, but the i-itiative and the decision on aU general questi,ns belong to the Federal Assembly. A letter from Geneva, of tho 28th ult., in the SentindlIe dn fJura says:- "This city isat present dull enough s far as business is concerned. Ther are very few Christmau parties, and th e retail tradce ij dnl3 notwithstanding the approach of the nevwyear. 'War is the only subject talked of. What reflects the highest honcuvron the Swiss people is, that no one seeks to avoid military service. Several even wbo were formerly officers have o%irod to serve as privates. All this is the more praiseworthy as such conduct is not dictated by ambition, there not being any possibility of gaining either crosses of honour or rank in Switzerland. The real strength of the country is never exaggerted in any man's mind, and nothing liko bravaco is ever heard. A loan of 40,000f. of liente (S50,03Of.) for extraordinary military expense was s;!b.;cribed here with a promptitude which does honour to the citizens of Geneva. The second di-ision of the Swiss ansiy las its headquarters at Mouticrs-Granval (Berne), and not a' Flecarier, As has been stated." A letter fromx Ciblentz, of the 2flth ult., in the Colog?ne Ga:ctfc, says:- " ThePrince of Prussiayesterdayasemhled on the parade the whole of the officers of the troops in garrison at Cologne, and informed them that, in consequence of the comD iciatons which had arisen with Switzerland. Prussia found herself in a very serious position. He congratulated by anticipation the troops wiho v.ere to take part in the expedition. Among those, he said, v;hom hc .saw a round him wrcre manr si-loso he had alreadyv seen fighting bravely, and he expected from them the sa;ne military virtues, in order to give fresh triumphs to the Prussian arms." ITALY. (FRos OU5 OWN> COaRR.SPOwnaiS^.) TUJRIN, DEe. 29. Tl'e Sardinian Court has again been thrown into mourning by the death of the King's aunt and mother-in-lawr, the Archduchess MIarie Elizabeth. His MIajesty has been deeply affected by thts loss, and left the capital immediately on hearing of it. Thze usual receptions and balls at Court are, of course, renounced for this season in consequence, and even many private parties have been postponed, so that the Carnival, wmhich practically begTins on Christmas-day, has set int wiath gloomy portent. The public mind in Ita7y has naturally been much excited at the intelligence which arrives from. day to day of the warlike preparations making on the part of Swvitzerland and Prussia, though very little doubt exists in well informed quarters of an arrangement being come to between the opponents 'without having recourse to the ordeal of battle. There have, howvever, undoubtedly been g!reat hopes entertained among the Liberal party in ltaly that matters mnight remain unsettled long enough to force the Federal Government to recall the Swviss citizens nowt in the service of the King of Naples, the Pope, and other Sovereigns; and the remarks which have bcen made on this subject in the Piedmontese papers have drawvn forth a protest from certain Swiiss resident in Turin, declaring that their Government has no powver to control the acts of Swviss citizens, and that their country should not be held responsible for the bad. taste of certain individuals w;ho chose to enter the service of despotic Sovereigns. This apology is reasonable enough, and it seems, indeed, that the Government of Naples-for that is the principal cnsturner-no longer deals with the Federal or cantonal Goverunments, but only ttith crimps, and that those Republicans who sell themselves for the support of tyranny do so wvithout any collusion on the part of their owtn Government. The sympathy of Piedmont for the cause of Switzerland in its quarrel with the King of Prussia has been unmistakeably showvn by the tone of the public press here, although the Swviss did not behave in the most neighbourly .way towards this country in its struggles for 7independence in 1848 and 1849. The Piedmontese thoroughly understand apparently that they have too many interests in common not to let bygones b7e bygones under sulch circumstances, and no doubt both the Government and the Chambers wll 1express theniselves to the same eflect on the meeting of Parliamlent next month if the dispute shoulld not have been brought to a termination, or submitted to arbitration, in the meanwhile. The people of other parts of Italy have still more interest than the Piedmuontese in the question immediately at issue ; and thereforc, though they have not the same means of making knowvn their feelings, I ant assured that great excitement prevails to know; the result. The Austrian Court having been throw.n into mourning by the samze event whaich ha, affected this Court, the progress of the Emperor has been delayed, and hc w;ill not arrive at Mfilan until the 16th of next month~ instead of the 6th. N o imrvm nt the sentiments of the TBIilanese on the subject of the Imperial visit has taken place apparently. All aCcounts from there, w-hether by letter or from persons w;ho have been staying in the town, are to the same effect-that the reception will be colder than at Venice. Even at *'enicec the slight relaxation showrn on the day of the regatta is said to have been merely transitory. His MLajesty had courted popularity by pardoning some of the lowest classes of the Giudecca w;ho had been convicted of theft and other crimes of tho kind, but nwithout gaining niuch admiration, except fromt the objects of his grace and their associates. The return of the political prisoners from Austrian fortresses had failed likewise! to excite gratitude, for they brought back tales of suffering and hardship endurod for offences which they and their friends, at least, consider very venial, and in some cases for no offence w.hatever, and they recounted the names of many fellow-prisoners remaining in duranco equally unmerited, so that, on the whole, the effect of their return to their homes seems only to havo been to evoke very odious comparisons betwreen the arbitrary despotism which condemned and the meagre nature of the amnesty which liberated them after so many years. There is, in fact, only too much reason to fear that, if it shall ever be in the power of an Austrian Emperor to wfin the affections of the [Lombards and Venetians, it will not be done by Francis Jo3eph. Young as he is, kis antecedents are strongly against his doing so. Already he has. w ithdrawnu all powver from the people by rescinding the consstitution given on his accession to the throne, arnd since then he has signed awiay full half his own authority to the Church of Rome. lf one could suppose E:mperors guilty of reading anything less orthodox tban an oRficial paper, one might hope that His MIajesty might see the admirable sketches of the state of Canada which appeared in Th7e Th,u.u a fewr days ago, in order that he might perceive the practUicability of a *population preserving all its national characteristic$, usages, and language, and yet owvning a devoted loyalty to a Sovereign of S different race. Xot many years since the Canadians had as much reason to desire annexation wfith the United States as the p7eople of the Loinbardo-Veneto have now. to join themnselves to Piedmont, and therefore Hlis Imperial Majesty should. take courage in his endeavour to disarm bis disaffected subjects; and when he h7as adopted the same conciliation as5 the ]3ritish Government has. done towards Canada he may justly expect the like result, but not before.

BANK CHARTER ACT. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TImES. Sir,-Your insertion of my former communication encourages me to pursue the subject. In the approaching session legislation must take plaee upon the Bank Charter Act. That measure must be renewed or repealed, partially or entirely; and, as preparatory to this result some judgment must be pronounced by the public, to arrive at a sound conclusion we must revert to the eircumstances creating the necessity out of which that measure arose, we must again examine the principles upon which it was founded, and the result, which have arisen under the biUl must be compared with the anticipations and predictions of those upon whose recommendation and authority the measure was passed. The act of 1844, though founded on scientific principles, was eminently a measure of a practical character. It was an attempt to apply an effectual safeguard against the inconvenience and danger which had aetually occurred on several occasions between 1819 and the period of pawzing the act. When the resumption . of cash payments was determined upon in 1819 the! Legislature subjected all issuers of notes to the obligation of paying their notes, on demand, in gold. But it took no further steps to secure the fulfilment of that obligation; no restriction was placed upon the number of issuers, nor upon the fluctuations in the amount of notes which such issuers might put forth. The efficiency of this system for the proper regu]ation of the circulation was subjected to severe trial, especially on three occasions-1825, 1837, and 1839. No reasonable person can be surprised at the results which ensued. The Legislature had imposed an obligation to pay the notes in gold on demand, without providing any security for the fulfilment of it. It required a constant coincidence of value between paper notes and metallie coin, but it put no restriction upon the issue of the paper notes, the value of which could be regulated and maintained by no other means than a strict limitation of the amount. The discussions which subsequently arose established a conviction in the public mind that the disasters of trade and the imminent danger of failure to maintain specie payments which marked those periods were intimately connected with mismanagement of the paper issues. Extensive insolvency of the issuers had occurred; and the issuing power had been greatly abused by maintainin, the amount of issues undiminished when the state of the exchanges and the steady decrease of the bullion reserve clearly demanded a contraction of the circulation, for the purpose of maintaining its value and securing its convertibility. When the period for the renewal of the Bank Charter arrived Sir Robert Peel applied his eminently practical mind to a consideration of the proper means of correctiag these evils. He saw that the discretion of the issuers is not a sufficient seeirity to the public for the proper regulation of the amount of the circulation, but that it must be secured by some positive enactment. He saw that banking purposes, or the supposed requirements of trade, do not constitute the proper neasure by which to regulate the amount of paper issues; but that these must be regulated with reference to the amount of the bullion into which the notes are to be at all times convertible. These considerations led Sir Robert Peel to the conclusion that, as an abstract principle, without reference to what is due to existing regulations, to established habits and prejudices, the paper money of a country ought to be issued by one body exclusively, and that the amount of that issue ought to be regulated in strict accordance withthe fluctuations in the amount of gold. Upon this principle the act of 1844 was founded; and in the provisions of the act this principle was carried out to an extent which was deemed sufficient to secure the great object in view. In some not unimportant particulars the application of this principle was, however, partially modified or suspended, in obedience to practical considerations of the nature already alluded to. The "Lssue Department" of the Bank of England was completely separated from the " Banking Department," and the fluctuations in the amount of bank notes put forth by the " Issue Department" were made to conform strictly to the amount of bullion in deposit. lNumerous sources of issue were still permitted to continue, but these were subjected to new regulations, the object of which was to put some effectual restraint upon the private discretion of the issuers, to establish a more close and immediate relation between the fluctuations in the amount of their issues and of the gold in deposit, and to diminish the danger of insolvency on the part oi the issuers. The question which now comes before the country is this-whether the act of 1844 ought to be renewed in its present form, or with modifications, or, whether it ought to be altogether repealed. To determine this question we must consider how far the act has accomplished the purpose for which it was passed, how far the principle upon -which it was founded has been verified by subsequent experience, and whether the anomalies still permitted to exist under the provisions of the act have been found to interfere with the full efficiency of the act to such an extent as to require further legislation for the correction or removal of them. The first great object of the act was the effeetu il maintenance of specie payments, and the suppression of all real danger and of such reasonable alarm and apprehension upon the subject as occurred in 1825, 1837, and 1839. And, second, the accomplishment of this result by means which should secure a constant conformity between the fluctuations in the amount of paper notes and of the buUion, and thus necessarily insure an early and therefore gradual contraction of circulation, instead of leaving it to fall, in an advanced stage of the drain of bullion, with sudden and disastrous violence upon a public unprepared, and therefore easily alarmed. That the act has fully accomplished aU that was expected from it in this respect admits of no reasonable doubt. It has been in operation during a period of 12 years, and in the latter part of this period we have passed through a severe trial-a sudden transition from peace to war, and again a return from a state of war to peace, immense mlfitary expenditure and heavy loans by the principal Govermments of Europe, a severe drain upon the precious metals in all the principal exchange towns in Europe, a great rise in the rate of interest throughout the continent,fromthe extensive destruction of capital during the war, followed by the sudden, though natural, expansion of com3mercial enterprise on the return to peace, and a firther pressure upon capital in this country, from the speculative activity springing out of the excitement of anew limitedliability law. Through the whole of this trying period the bullion in the Bank of England has been steadily maintained at an amount which effectually suppresses all alarm or anxiety respecting our speci payments; the unavoidable preasure upon the money-market has corae on gradually and progressively, in concurrence with the drain upon the bullion, and, the remulTt being clearly anticipated, and the cause of it correctly understood by the trading community, it has produced neither alarm nor serious inconvenience. In this respect the contrast of the circumstanes attending the recent drain, and of the manner in which it has been met, with the effects produced during former periods of pressure in 1825, 1837, and 1839 is most satisfactory and encouraging. F In the 12 years which have now elapsed from the passing of the act the trade of this country has more than doubled, we have passed from peace to war, we have raised large loans, we have greatly increased our taxation without any decrease of the previous productiveness of each branch of our revenue, we have astained a protracted drain of bulion, and we arenow speedily progressing through a period of pressure and difficulty, the cause of serious embarrassment in other countries, without any real disturbance with us of public credit or any apprehension respecting the -olidity of our monetary system. The high rate of interest, the long. continued export of bulion, and the unavoidable pressure upon our monetary system are met without alarm, without difaculty, without any general discredit. This firm and steady condition of our trading community will bear a favourable comparison with the [state of credit in other countries under the influence of the same disturbing causes. This consideration leads to-the conclusion that there is nothing in our monetary legislation really unsound; that the law by which we have placed our paper issues upon a solid basis is perfectly consistent with the unlimited development of our trading energies under favourable circumstances, and with a solid and steady state of public credit and commercial resources during periods of adverse exchanges and of increased demand for capital. But a relaxing power is caUed for by some persons. What necessity can there be for any special provision to facilitate the relaxation of a law, under the stringent application of which such results have been accomplished? Let us consider well the inevitable consequence of introducing any relaxing power under the act. Will it not destroy the real efficiency of the bill ? As the law now stands the commencement of a drain of bullion is immediately followed by measures of precaution on the part of the Bank and the public, engendered by the conviction that contrac- tion of issues and restriction of credit must proaress - without interruption until the drain of bullion has been effectually checked. Convinced that they can have no ultimate resource or security except in a cessation of the drain produced by contraction of issues and an increase in the value of money, both the Bank and the public watch with vigilant attention the first symptoms of decreasing bulion, and, resorting at once to those measures which are the only legitimate and certain means of arresting the drain, they obviate aU ultimate danger and are enabled to meet the difficulties of the crisis-the contraction of issues, the rise in the rate of interest, the restriction of credit-without embarrassment or alarm. Upon this point we may now make a conclusive appeal to experience. But if a relaxing power be introdaced into the act a strong tendency will at once arise, influencing both the Bank and the public to rely, less upon their own early precaution and prudence, and to look to a resort to this relaxing power as their ultimate source of relief. By this means the adoption of precautionary and corrective measures will be delayed, the' early and gradual contraction of credit and of transactions will be interrtupted, the steady confidence with which the public now contemplate the progress of a drain of bullion, and meet the pressure which necessarily accompanies it, will be disturbed, and thus the real utility and efficiency of the bil will be seriously impaired-possibly altogether lost. The act was passed for the express purpose of preventing the possibility of an undue issue of paper money in periods when the temptation to such undue issue becomes pressing and dangerous. The introduction of a relaxing power would be a public declaration inserted in the act itself that its restrictive provisions shall not be enforced when those peculiar circumstances occur which render the provisions Of the act necessary to protect the solidity of our monetary system. What would be thoughtof the courage which claims the privilege of running away whenever the danger becomes great, of the fortitude which shrinks when the trial is severe or the pain acute, or of the moral code which sanctions the principle of relaxation whenever the temptation to crime becomes strong or the effort of resistance is peculiarly painful? The absurdity is in no respect less in the matter now under our consideration. No great danger can be averted, no pressing oevil can be removed, without the strain and effort of a determined struggle or the painfulness of some present sacrifice. WVhen all the civilized world is competing for capital no cou:try can retain its due proportion which wiU not consent to pay the necessary price in the form of a high rate of interest. When peculiar causes create a general and severe demand for the precious metals the country which will not consent to bear her proportionate share of the pressure must consent to yield to other countries in which there is more firmness and more regard to principle, those precious metals, and to abandon that metallic standard which she has neither the virtue nor the resolution to maintain. Is England, then, the country which is unable or unwilling to pay the rate of interest which in a temporary emergency may becoine requisite for retaining the amount of capital proportioned to the extent of her engagements; or is England the country which has neither the firmness nor the honesty to bear the temporary pressure which may be necessary for maintainiing the metallic value of her currency and for upholding the good faith of her standard? But weakness and irresolution in the hour of trial always prove false friends to those who foolishly place reliance in them. They lead not to honour Or to safety, but are the fatal guides to disgrace and danger. Monetary affairs are not exempt from this universal law. The relaxing power will prove a false and treacherous guide to the country that relies upon it. It means an increase of issues not warranted by any increase of bullion; and it wiU of course be resorted to only during an adverse state of the exchanges. But bullion goes out of the country only because it is in greater demand elsewhere than with us-thus affording conclusive proof that our currency is comparatively redlndant. At such a moment to increase the issue of no'es must tend to increase the redundancy of our currency, and give additional force to the causes which produce the export of bullion. The immediate effect may be a delusive appearance of relief; but the ultimate result must be to extend the mischief, and to render the final coirection of it more difficult, and attainable only by a still greater sacrifice. It is important that these inevitable results of the introduction of a relaxing power into the act should be clearly understood. The public otherwise, deluded with the belief that they still retain the protection and security iwhich the bill in its present form undoubtedly affords, may find, when the period of trial arrives, that in adopting the relaxing pover they have surrendered the substance and grasped only the shadow. _l E RCATOR.

IRELAND. (mox OUR OWN COzRRO1wDNT.) DUBLIN, SATURDAY 1io0RE;G. LEGAL KNCOURAGE5:NT OF PLUNDEE. Under this head theFreemaa7Vs Journal has a pertinent article in reference to the ease of Mr. Montgomery Knihting, whose "real estate" has been the subject of legal investigation this week:- " The criinial law, as regards public defaulters, requires serious modifications. At present it is almost impossible to insure a conviction on a charge of enmbzzlement; and we have seen, in the case of Ir. Knighting, that convictioa for forgery under certain circumstances does not hold out those terrors which the uninitiated were led to supposa. Mr. Knighting's counsel, in the course of the week, argued, and argued, we believe, correctly, that the present law wilt protect for his personal use such portions of the pluander of the Great Southern Company as he invested with dne discretion. It would appear that Mr. Knighting robbad his employers of severan thousand pounds, and that hi invested some of this money in the purchase of ' real' property. Now, a just law would hand over all that property to the rightful owners. But the old aristocratic system -teps in in aid of felony-and why not? for it was itself a huge felony-and declares, according to the undisputed dicta of Mr. Knighting's counsel, that real estate is sacred, and that, even when proved to be the direct produce of money feloniously obtained, the convicted felon who stole the money to purchase it may, at the expiration of his seatence, comeoutandliveinthel uhousenjoymentofhis 'real property' without fear of mglestation. The money which this felon expended in the purchase of chattel property is forfeited to the Crown, but all the fee-simple and £reehold purchased by the proceeds of his forgeries, the law, it is argued, will guara for him till his return to the world fro a his temporary retreat will allow of his again revelling iu bis booty. Now, if this be the law, there is no more certain road to fortune and a luxrious old age than the open -ath of felony. The felon requires only to be bold in the execution of the robbery and arrstocratic in his tastes, and a few years of seclusion, during which his morals and his health will be carefuly attended to at the public cost, willsecure to him, hile he is yet youthful and vigorous, wealth which a life of Vedspent industry will not secure for the virtuous and upright when the worn-out energies are no longer eoual to the struggles of life.

The commission of inquiry in the case of Knighting terminated to-day, and the jury found the Crown entitled to all the personal property of the convict, consisting of bonds, bills of exchange, promissory notes, policies of insurance, &c., estimated to amount to about 12,0001. in value. This will be all given by the Crown to the rai-. way company. The convict holds his real property, as he was not capitally convicted, and subjected to attainder. It is valued at 3001. a-year.

THE MURDERER DEDEA REDAKIEg. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In your report of the execution of Dedea Redanie5 I observe several mistatements have occurred, some of which I am anxious to correct, in justice to the unfortunate man and to myself. As a native of Germany, and having conversed with him familiarly for the last five days previous to his execution, I had ample opportunity to know the true state of his mind; and I am inclined to think that these errors happened in consequence of the very imperfect English which the prisoner spoke, and of confounding the different periods of time. From your report of Friday, Jan. 2, it would appear that the poor man preserved (not. withstanding my efforts, and even after receiving the sacrament), Mahomedan notions in his mind to the very latest period of his existence; and he is said to have exclaimed almost immediately before he was severed from the world, " In a few moments I shall be in the arms of my dear Caroline." Now, as I happened to be with him from the early morning on Thursday to the last moments of his life, and I alone conversed with him all t hat timo, I am able to state that he spent his last two hours without interruption in prayer and devotion with me, and appeared deeply impressed with pious thoughts, and especially with the Passion of Christ, the history of which I was reading to him. He made no mention of the names of his two unfortu. nate victims for the last two days in my presence, though I spent a considerable time with him morning and evening - bet he frequently expressed sorrow for his crime, even with tears in his eyes, from Tuesday evening last till his execution. About a quarter of an hour before the fatal 12 he went on his knees to again beg pardon of God and to receive the last blessing, but he never uttered anything like the exclamation stated in your report the whole of the time I was with him on the morn. ing of his end. He never expressed any doubt, though I frequently asked him to that effect, but he attended with the greatest eagerness and visible desire of learning to the instructions I gave him, and he received them with a childlke willingness. I do not believe that any doubt or fears disturbed his last night's rest, as he told me hlmself that he slept well, and that he would not take any refreshment for the last morning, merely out of a religions view. I tbink I am justified in stating that he died truly penitent and received death with truly Christian disposition. I pasw over some other minor inaccuracies, but you will grea:ly oblige by inserting this in your next. I have the honour to remain, Sir, yours. FATHEPR LAURENCE. dan. V.
THB MfAGISTRATE AND THE THIEF. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-May I be allowed to tell the following plain tale!-. A gentleman sitting with two or three friends in his dining-room is all at once informed by one of his servants that " somebody is trying tbe door !" On cautiously listen, ing he finds that there is something going on at the door and on issuing suddenly forth collars a man on the doorstep. The cook, who has been watching in the area, swears the man so collared is the one who has been engaged for some time "doing something at the door." The man is given in charge, is recognized by many of the forceas a thief and as a companion of thieves. Fortunately, nothing is found upon him but some silver, a pipe, a cigar, and some lucifer matches. The presiding magistrate before whom he is taken this morning is astounded to hear that any one could ever have been locked up on any such charge I "The man might have been lighting his cigar r" The cook swears to him, the master of the house collars him, and the police recognize him as an old acquaintance; but at 10 o'clock A; night he is only lighting a cigar at the lock of a street-door. The worthy magistrate is astounded at such a charge being insisted on, and the householder who made it and the polceman who took it are alike ignominiously disnissedL So, Sir, that when, on returning home at 10, U, or 12 o'clock at night, I find a dubious-looking gentleman performing certain evolations on miy street door by way of getting a light for hi cigar, I am to beg his pardon for interrupting him, and to ask him politely " what he will take to drink." The above occurred simply as lit is to'd in Connaughterrace, on Friday n-gbt, was heard at the Marylebone police-court on Saturday morning, and is vouched for bY one who encloses his name and address, and at the sam0 time subscribes himself CIVIS.

TEH PACIFIC. |OUTaAxPTON, Jls. 4. By the steamer Orinoco, arrived to-day from the West Indies, we have news from Panama to the 9th of December. Ier Majesty's ship Monarcb, Admiral Brnce, the steam. corvette Pearl, Captdin Sotbeby, and the Esk, Captain Sir James M'CIure, arrived on the previous night from Punta Arens. It was not known a Panama how long the British squadron would remain, or for what purpose they had come. The Pacific Steamn Navigation Company's stcamer New Granada, Captain Paton, arrived at Panama on the 6th of December, with the semi-monthly South Pacific mail and $2T71,770 in specie. Her dates were, Valparaiso, November 16; Callao, 27; Paita, 30; Guayaqul, December 1. When the New Granada left Callao the following English vessels of war were in port :-The President, the Naiad and the Cockatrice. The screw frizate Tribune had sailed from Valparaiso for Panama. At Chili, -Joaquin Carbacho bad been sentenced to death for the murder of his wife in the principal square of San. tiago, in the middle of the day, and in the presence of a number of persons. He immediately gave himself up Jealousy was the cause of the fatal act, and public feeling was in favour of a reprieve. The works of the Santiago and Valparaiso Railway, and those of the Tacua and Santiago line, are progressing rapidly. The new Cabinet was completed. The Chilian war steamer Esmeralda, 20 guns, huUt in England for the Government, had arrived safely at Valpa. raiso. Her officers speak highly of her performance during the voyage. There is no later news from the Republic of Ecuador, neither is there any of interest from Bolivia. From Peru we learn that the revolutionary movement in the south seems to be on the increase, and two of the national vesseLs, the Los and the Apurimac, had gone over to the revolutionary party. The Izcuchaca, the Tumbes, and the Ucayli had beea sent after them by the Govern. ment, and a number of English and Amedcan beach. combers were enlisted to aid in their capture. The general opinion was that the Government ships would most likely get the worst of it, and either be taken or join the revolntionary party. The President Castilla had issued a decree pronouncing the Loa and Apurimac pirates, and that vessels of any nation were authorized to seize thena General Lizarzaburn had been named Minister of War and Marine. Marshal San Rramon, with all the force he could muster, marched from Islay to rauna to join the division of General Freyre, quartered there. The Comercio states that the revolutionary movement in Ariquipa was on its last legs when the news of the Apurimac having pronounced in its favour gave it new life. The Ariquipa correspondent of the Comcrcio says,-; On the 'pronunciamientoW of the Loa and Apurimac, San Ramon retreated thence to Tambo with 180 men, and the same day Islay declared in favour of the revolutionary party. On the 19th San Ramon reached Tambo, where he was detained by Colonel Brusset, but the same night he made his escape,-it is supposed to Puno." Private letters from Lima inform us that it was thought CastiDla would be able to put down the revolution, as the Convention would vote him extraordinary powers. Commercial advices from Valparaiso state that during the fortnight ending on the 15th of November a general stagnation had been felt in the market. The transactions verified offered little interest, sales having taken place principally for local consumption, and but very little for abroad. The sales for Bolivia had been very poor, and those for the Argentine Republic were hardly perceptible. This slackness was to be explained by the fact that the purchases for the spring were already made in August and September last, and thoe for the summer season only begin in December next. In home produce nothing worthy of note transpired. The high prices in the leading export articles still continued. The market as pretty well supplied with all kinds of mer. chandise. We have received, vid Panama, papers from Melbourne to the 13th of October, but the overland mail had pro'vionsly put us in pOsseSsion of news from that colony to the 20th.
THB D IVELLINGS OP THE POOR TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Your late editorial rerharks on the houses of the London poor leadme to offer on this subject some observations which are the result of experience and of much thought. You justly say that "This is a field of action for all persons who are desirous of marking their passage through the world by acts of real humanity and beneficence," while, from the observation, "that actual local knowledge is aU indispensable requisite in deciding amid conflicting opinions as to the superior advantages likely to result from zhe construction of new buildings or the improvement of those already occupied by the labouring classes," it is obvious that you have weighed and approciated some of the difficulties attendmg the question. Extensive observation leads me to the conclusion that while the construction of new buildings is the most effective way of improving the dwellings of the labouring classes, as thereby completeness of general arrangement and of detail can be secured, the comparative smallness of outlay required in patting substantially constructed old buildings into proper or er, and fitting them up on sanitary principles, renders the latter plan generally the mogt remunerative, and that where such property can be obtained on reasonable terms it is the most easy of accomplishment. One of the chief difficulties in carrying out this latter plan arises from the factitious value me. on guch property the moment an individual or association seeks to purchase, in a particular locality or parish, with a view to improvements. Let the buildings bc in ever so miserable and dilapidated a condition, the owner demands a price im proporrson to the rent he receives from the overcrowded tenants, which is generally as high as they can afford to pay after a considerable sum has been expended in putting the buildings juto good sanitary condition, and the number of occupant, a greatly reduced. 1 could point out various instances where this impediment has much retarded, if not altogether proved fatal to the carrying out of well-devised schemes for improving existing dwellings. Such a difficulty would be in great measure, if not totally removed, were the good sanitary state of all buildings let for human habitations enforced by legislative enactment, and the owners of such property held responsible for the infringement of rules essential to the physical welfare of the occupiers. The community at large suffers from the evil effects resulting from the cupidity of landlords, and the ignorance as well as helplesmess of a class of tenants whose circumstauces oblige them to occupy whatever dwellings may be within their rech. A sufficiency of light and air, with proper drainage and suitable means for the disDoing of al refuse, with freedom from noxious vapours, and a good supply of water, ought to be universally enjoined. When owners of houses tenanted by the labouring classes find that they must incur considerable outlAy in pttrting them into a healthy condition they will often prefer disposing of such property at its fair value to individuais or to a,sociations influenced by philanthrapc views, and thus through the combined action of theLegi,tureand of private beneficence much rmay, within no disant period, be done for the removal of an evil which, the more closely it be investigated, is found at the root of most of the sufferings peculiarly incident to the labouring clses9 The act for regulating common lodginghouses has led to the most beneficial results, as official returns laid before Parliament abundantly prove; a more extended application of the same principle of leI tion to all houses let in tenemeelts to the labouring clases could not fail of greatly ameliorating their condition and of conducing much to their noral as well as physical improvement. Many continental Governments have recently enacted laws to enforce an improved sanitary condition in the dwellings of the working classes, and their necessity is proved by such cases as that of Genoa, where, in the recent invasion of cholera, the municipality was put to the expense of 12,500 Of, chiefly for the relief of the inhabitants of the unhealthy quarters, of those who from the defective state and confined atmoephere of their dwrellings wore the greates sufferers.

COPYHOLD TENURE. TO TEE EDITOB OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Among the grievAnces enumerated by you as requiring legislative aid for their removal, you have omitted one by no means the least-iz., the abolition of copyhold tenure. It is true there is already a bill making it compulsory when demanded, but by a provision of this bll a person demanding its operation as regards his property is compelled to pay the expense of putting the enfranchisement into operation, and besides bas to go into court and pay a fine over and above the sum demanded for enfranchising; the demand thus legalized amounts, in fact, to a prohibition. Suppose an estate worth 1,0001.; it is already free for the life of the owner, but he wishes to muako it freehold for his descendant: he has first to apply to the commissioners and the stewards of the court (generaUy residing in London); a day is appointed for the holding a special couirt in the country ; a fine of 73 to 10 per cent.- say, 751 to l001, ba5 to be paid; 3A to 6 ears' purcha3se upon the estate, varying from 175. to _., for emancipotion; the expense of commissioners, stevards, stamp-, &c,, amounting to an indefinite sum-amounting from 10 to 20 per cent., ad thus forming an aggregate from &370 to 6004 npon his oniginal J000Z; ana thus the copyhold tenant is detered from movmg let he should find hinmelf with a freehold COsting him 2001. or 3001. more than it is worth.~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~oe hn ti Surely some leos expensive mode might be adopted equitably to settle this matter between the tenant and the lord of the manor I I am.

TINSPOR1TAION. TO THE EDITOB OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The long and oontinued diseuageons on the convict quesion do not seem as yet to have reached any practical solution. The vast importanoe of the subject demands fuller con ideration; for, urgent as the abolitionists of the deervedly dooimed ticket-of-leave sysem are for a renewal of transportation as the readiest mode of getting over the immediate difficulty, when we recollect the frightful consequences of purely convict settlements in Tasmania and Norfolk- Island we ought to pause and seriously deliberate as to whether no other and better mode of disposing of our criminals can be devised with that safety to society which ought to be the basis of aU legilation on the subject. I see no difficulty In finding proper sitnations for forming convict establishments in the vast unoccupied district, of Northern Australia, the Rudson's Bay territories, or the Falkiands. But the question is, can or cannot any better plan be carried out? 1st. Is transportation sufficiently deterrent as apunih_ ment and effective for reformatory discipline? When we see the grat number of respectable persons of the working classes laying by money to purchase trans. portation or emigration for themselves to our colonies when the Colonial-office finds no difficulty in procuring educated men of good families to fill ill-paid situations in the establishments of the colonial Governments, many of them in the most pestiferous climates in tho world-and when everybody knows that thousands of our convicts in the Australian colonies have attained competence, and even great wealth, within few years after their transportation, I cannot admit or believe that the mere fact of expatriation can be considered by nine out of 10 of them as a punishment to be viewed with horror or alarm. On the contrary, there have been many instances of convicts who have complained bitterly of their being kept in this country to undergo their sentences I ant therefore disposed to believe that, instead of transportation being continued as a punishment, it ought to be held out as a reward to the well-conducted convict on the termination of his sentence. Secondly, the cost of transporting convicts is another serious consideration. It varies naturaUy with the distance of the dependency to which they may be sent, but, taking into account the various charges of freight, guard, passages, &c., the expense may be fairly estimated at not less than three times that of the passage of free persons. Suppose a colony of convictslanded on atny given spot, distant as that ought to be from any free and productive community, the criminals and their guard must be rationed at a great expense, probably a ship or ships of war detained permanently, or until sufficiently secare barracks for their accommodation and that of their guards have been constructed, at the enormous outlay which all buildings of that character involve. Are the work-s which may be performed by the convicts always of a nature to justify the immense outlay; and when the pioneering labours have ceased what is to be the next move ? Experience shovws now that free and convict labour can no longer be amalgamated in a colony; the prosperous results of New South Wales cannot, therefore, be repeated. Are the convicts to be leftonthegroundthey have prepared, bad and less bad together, without the admixture of the free element and the necessary capital to develope the capabiities of the soil ? Who isUtopian enoughtobelievein thepossibilityof therege. nerationxof *society composedentirely of criminal, ? Arethey to be moved from one place to another preparing settlements for free emigrants to follow them? These questions must be deliberately settled before we reaume transportation. If plans of the above nature be ever carried out they wiU not dispose of one-half of our delinquents, as only thhe ablebodied could be employed in pioneering works, and there would remain the feeble and physically inefficient class still to be provided for-perhaps the most numerous, and by no means the least dangerous in the more talented and ingenious arts of swindlingand depredation. I wi not, however, ventare to say that a judicious selection oF fertile and healthy situations to prepare for the ultimate foundation of free settlements might not be attended with success. This cannot, however, be looked for unless the climate and country possess inducements to emigration. Among other places which have been thought of for a convict settlement the FaLlkland Islands bave been mentioned. Evidence was, however, given before the committee of the House of Lords ast session which induced their Lordships to report against their eligibility-no place being less suited for a reformatory establishment of that nature, in consequenec of the islands having a most limited demand for labour, and neitber climate nor soil offering any inducements for the emancipated to settle themselves in them after the expiration of their sentence. Thirdly, cannot criminals be punished and reformed without danger to society at home! I am of opinion that these ends may be attained with great gain to the public in England, without depriving offenders of reasonable prospects of reformation and a return to habits of industry and good conduct. Who will deny the lamentable deficiency of harbours of refuge around the coasts of Great Britain and Ireland? Will it be believed that from the mouth of the 'Thamnes northward until you reach the Cromarty Firth in Scotland, a distance of 600 miles, there is no real shelter or harbour of refuge for the immense coasting trade, How many wrecks t ceur annually, with frightful loss of life, in consequenoe of the want of those havens, which present no engineering difficulties beyond a vast amount of labour to construct? At Bridlington Bay, Scarborough, Warkwortb, and other places, nature offers many facilities for making estensive barbours and secure anchorages. E-nploy convicts on work of that nature, and you convert them into preservers insteas' of destroyers of the lives and plumlderers of the property of our feUow-subjects. How weak and inefficient are our coast defences ! Reclaimable swamps and estuaries, uncultivated moors, and waste forest-lands are all works suited to the employment and reformation of convicts. But let me put the case in a practical shape :-Suppose this question asked,-how I would dispose of say 5,000 convicts ? Let Her Majcsts Government deide to erect another harbour on the scale of Portland ; a fort or fortresses, or other useful public works, sufficient to emyiog that number, and dilrect that plans be prepared accord ingly. Select the class of prisoners suited to the different descriptions of labour to be performed. Those unsuited to heavy out-door work, if artisans, to be employed in their different vocations to supply the wants of the others, or taught trades, if ignorant of any. Should it be thought dvisable, there is no doubt that responsible contractors would undertake the works, paying so much pcz diem for the convicts' labour under Governmnent control. This wai formerly done at Sheerness, when Messrs. Jol'iffo and Banks undortook the contract. for the docks, then under the late celebrated engineer John Rennie. The well conducted prisoner should have a portion of his earnings placed to his credit, and the prospect of a free psasage As a freeman to any of our colonies at his option, as a reward, on the termination of his sentence, which ought never to be shortened unless it can be proved that he was wrongfully convicted. Nothing, in my opinion, can lessen the fear of punishment more than the belief in the minds of eriminals th'at a well-disguised and deceptive repentance will procure from the chaplain a certificate to obtain a remission of servitude. First convictions ought, except under very aggravated eircumstanos, to be lenientbl dealt with, and I would entirely abolish all purely vexatious and unprofitable work, such as the treadmill, crank, &Sc. Pri. soners are hardened and irritated, in my opinion, by thosa punishments more even than by flogging, which, if possible, shoald be avoided. How, then, are the refractory to.bs Coerced? Bread and water, solitary confinement, in all cases rations proportioned to the amount of work done, and I see no reason why they should bo superior in quality or quantity to those procurable by honest laboutrers. Sappose that works of the above nature with the 6,000 convicts are established. I shoald recomnend that plans for similar or ocher constructions should be ready for eoem mesoement at the expiry of the sentences of the prL soners on No. 1 works Those who have conducted them- selves wel, and choose emigration or freo transportation, will oo disposed of; and I should offer free employment on works No, 2 to aU those who are unable to procure work elsewhere, warning thom that, being guaranteed against actual want, they shall if again convicted beo sentenced to incarceration and hard labour for life, classify the prisoners m to crime and sentences, and exclude all intercourse with famlies, friends, or acquaintances, which msy be done as effectually in England as in an Australian settlement, I have no visionary views of very large proportions of reclamation, but I am satisfied that the confirmed thief dreads nothinso nuch as continuous labour. I have, how- ever, seen practically that the better disposed will undcr the stimulus of reasonable rewards work cheerfully, provided the work is of a usefeti kind and with which they are acquainted. I tate, from observation, tlht I have seea mere than once a gang of convicts employed on public works within a short distance of a free body of labourers chalenge the freemen and beat them, bnth in tho qaantity and quality of the work they were performing. A rigid adherencoe to rules of theaboverLature would, in my opinion bh muore effectivo as a deterrent to crime than transportation, as carried on hitherto, to the Anstralias. There are, however, other advanteges of this plan over transportation. Many great works of acknowledged national utility would bo constructed which there is no prowpect 31 present of accomplishing in any other uanner. An i .mermi outlay in the transportation of the convicts and the uss- telance of gt establishment' of off5oer and troops iu remote quarters of the globe would be avoided; ar,d if tho Security, discipline, and reformation of the criminals b3 considered, this duty srely can be better performed at home. vigilantly overlooled, than by intrusting vast responsibilities to functionpries too far removed from super. irtendence and controL Time presses; niext year the discharge of the penal-strvitude prisoners Will commence; why not provide labour for them ? Can wo expect that they will be better than the ticket-of-leave men, whose crimes have now almost frightened the nation out of it wits? How can a ticket-ofleave man or dischargod convict maintain himself, with the feeling which exists in this country againgt him! A, matters stand At pres3nt, he has no choice but to 6teal or starve. Provide work for him, and if he again errs put it out of his power for the future by incLrceration for life. The safety and intereats of the public demand decided and effectual remedies; but, to be effectual, release crimituali mnst have some alternativo betwoen sarvation and a resort to crime. I am. &c. A PRACTICAL MAN. London, Jan. 3. TO THIE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Allow me to begin what I have to say IF quoting a paragraph in a letter which appearod in yout yesterday's peper signed " Canada Weat." Your correspondent sks, " Why could not England just as well select some of her own northern islands for this purpose as to be troubling other people with her rogues and vagabondsr' VWhy, indeed? This is just what eminent and far-sightod men, who are now in their grves, said 10 or even 20 year. ago, when our colonies began to kick at the infliction of penal settlements. What those men prophesied has now bappened. The impossibility of continuing that syste hbas bten proved, and also the utter failure of the alternative of prison discipline and tickets of leave, wvhich are just as ressonable as the French and German plan of keeping their domestic drainage in their houes. The Hebrides seem designed by Providence to meet our wants, surrounded as they are by deep and difficult seas, presenting an area sufficiently wide for different degrees of punishment and room for amelioration, and within a few bours' sail of bomee; conveyance thither and prevention of escape alike easy and cheap. All the places that have hitherto been suggested-Caf. fraria, the country north of Oregon, Hudson's Bay terni. tory, Rupert's Land, Carpentaria-have the disadvantage of being on continents. Wherever they are not cut offby the sea tho most desperate rogues will always find means to league with the savages and force their 'way to the settlenuents. To islands, then, our convicts must be sent, if they are to be sent anywhere, and it is cheaper to send them to the Hebrides than to the Sonth Seas Of courso Highland proprietors wil grumble as old ladies do when a school is built near them; but they wil have to givo way to an imperial necessity. A legislator of note lately proposed the Isle of Lundy, without any regard to the feelings of Devonshire and South Wales squires You wiU perceive that the tourist route of Iona, Staffa, and Skye is not interfered with. Of course Government will have to buy up such islands and tbere certainly have been proprietors who, from wane of capital and despairing to ameliorate their land, wonld have been willing to treat. The advantage of the Hebrides is that there are many of them, and some, such as Lewis and Uist, of considerable siZe. There might be different degrees of punishmentbarren rocks for the most hardenod criminals, milder scenes for milder offences Then there would be no lack of em ploymeut-cutting and stacking peat, planting and reclaim ing bog land in favourable situations, building harbours Of refuge, which are much needed along that iron-bound coast and agricultural pursuits. Oats and potatoes might be groswn to any amount, and there is sheep pasturage in abundance What is wanted in the way of wheat could nowhere be more cheaply supplied than from Canad. Then, as tho convicts began to show signs of amendment, they might be conveyed to a separate island, and there they might havo their wiveR and families. There would be foul scope for philanthropical teachers, and the children would bo enabled to enter society on fair terms. Moreover, we need not tie ourselves to the Hebrides There are the Orkneys and Shetlands, and the Arran Isles off the coast of Galway; above all, the Islo of Rathlin, where a harbour of refuge is most wanted between the stormy Mull of Cantire and the basaltic cliffs of the north coast of Ireland, and only accessible under peculiarly favourable conditions of wind and tide. Hoping that you will consider this letter as much entitled to consideration as some that you have published, I am, Sir, yonr obedient servant, OXONESSIS. J &U. Z.
RIFLED CANNON. TO TH1E EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-After giving insertion to the letter from Mr. Armstrong which appears in your paper to-day, you vwiU, I am sure, see the justice of giving publicity o tho folloving few= lies from me. On the 13th of March, 1855, I obtined with a common 9-pounder field gun rifled, pointed with one degree elevation, a range of ,114 yards first gra7e with a shot weighing 121b. and a charge of 21b. of powder. The experiuments were made on the 2Gth of July foUowring, and tho samo gun was used. On this occasion my shells weighed 1431b. each, and were propelled with charges of 13lb. and 21b. of powder. The ra&D;e were as follows:- At 5 dogrees elevation... 2,075 yards ... 3,800 vards AtO ,, ... 3,275 , .3,805 At 12 ... G,620 , 3,S0P These results were confirmod by several subsequent experiments; and, finally, on the 2d of Juno, 1856, with a rifled 32-pounder service gun, weighing 56 ewt., I obtained, with 5lb. of powder and a shell of similar construction, weighing 5Olb., a range at first graze of 2,390 yards, the gun having 5 degrees elevation.

RAILWAY SZASON TICKETS TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Permit n c through the medium of your columns to lay before tho world a suggestion which, if carried ont, would, I think, benefit -ail.wxy companies and accom. modate the public-vi7., that the directors of railways should rAnction the sale of 50 or 100 first, second, or third clasg tickets, at a rateable discount, in accordance with the prce of present contracts, which are now only issued to travel first class. That the public wold bencfit I think au vwill admit. The arrangement would do away with contracts, and tho ,cw and obnoxious demand for a depod1t from the contractor that the contract ticket may be delivered up on expiraion ofSho tergn. Fvery traveller would have to delirer up his ticlk-t on demana. That the railway companies would benefit I think there is also no doubt; moat rceglar passengen would prefer having their tickets at hand rather than be oblited on ewch occasion to take their turn in a booking-office. The company would be in possession of a largur amount of cash in advanco which in every commezinal cnterpnris is a matter of cona aiderable importance, hany arguments can be brought to spport the suggestion, but I Shink enough has been uaid to brng the matter before I am.

THE DEPAR7ED YEAR. (From the Examiner.) Expired, precisely at midnight, on the night of last Wed. resday, at the advsnced and extraordinary age of 366 days, tbe profigate old year 1856. We waut the pen that wrote the epitaph on Colonel Chartres to do justice to the memory Of one of the most unprinciplei years the obsequies of which we ever assisted in celebrating. lie was an onnus miiabilis of commercial immorality, and, for confoutnding right and wrong and mseum anid iuuma, had as good a clams to the title of the " Year of Confusion" as his ancestor 46 B.C., whose irregularities were rather COssar's than his own, and were atoned for by the reform they introduced into the calendar. If 1856 had any relgion, it was the religion of the dirtiest of divinities, who never before cointed such a host of enthusiastic rogues in his servico. The year was " littered under Mercury," like Autolyons; but the Autolyci 'Who distinguished themselves were ambitious knaves, far above "the snapping up of unconsidered trifles." They snapped up fortunes as commuon pickpockets snap up handkerchiefs, planned their robberies over champagne, and executed them in curricles and tandems. Such was the astonishing Sadleir; such the dashing Robson and refined Redpath; such was Sir Dean Paul, whose house of business was both "house of prayer and den of thieves;" such were the Gordons and Cummings; such the worshipful company of the Royal British Bank-giants of fraud, titanic swindlers, men with snaws for widows' houses, and who devoured the portions of orphans like ogres in pantomimes. It is diBicult to find a week among the last 52 not infamously ttinguished bysoine huge commercial defalcation, some daring embezzlement, some startling baDkruptcy, some atrocious breach of trust, some huge shope or another of avarice and rapacity-senators, bankers, doctors, clerks, servants alternately figuring in the drama of crime, occasioially diversified with an appalling suicide on Hampsteadheath, or a frightful deed ot blood like that still mucking justice in Dublin. As a politidan the past year resembled the noble Lord at the head of the Government, in being more famed for its foreign than its domestic politics. The year 1856 was too busy abroad to find time for doing much that was useful or creditable at home. The deceased, in truth, was an old hypocrite, and niade his warlike operations and diplomatic manoeuvres a pretext for not doing what he wanted the honest disposition to do. Tho war and peace served his turn equally well. Sword in hand how could be take up the business of legislation? And when he dropped the sword for the olive-branch he found an excuse inthe latter also for doing nothing-the domestic employment that he loved. In short, as a Parliamentary character, he bore a strking likeness to more members of the honourable House tdhan we care to name-he was a mighty talker and a small This character was by none supported better than by the Metropolitan Board of Works, which entered into it with spirit. To talk being the special gift of the Board, the Uovernmeut judiciously left them nothing eise to do, appointing a commission to drain the metropolis, while the Board vwill continue to discuss the question. Turning to another department, the Horse Guards, we have only to censure it for being out of the fashion of the day. The Duke of Cambridge did something, and did it energetically and welL His Royal Highiiess put down practical joking in the only practical way, and introduced improvements into the system of staff appointments, most valuable in themselves, and to be received as pledges of further reforms in our long-neglected and inisruled army. The military humbug of the year was the Chelsea Commssion; its history belongs to the chapter of the year's bubbles, including the board we have just iiientioned, the ticket-ofleave system, the Russian Railway Company,Sir Charles Napier's fame as an admiral, and Mr. Disraeli's character as a statesman. Abroad the year was not idle; but it achieved nothing very dazzling. We finished an ill-managed war in a hurry, and we patched up an unintelligible peace with the greatest deliberation ; the year involved us in a variety of diplomatic embarrassments from which it did not live to extricate us' the present Conferences are the old bungler's bequest to 185, and whether they may not prove a dounnosa 7z-ecditas it will take a new year to disclose. Then he made us a little ridiculous, it cannot be denied, in Italy, withdrawing our ambassador from Naples, for what reason it is innpossible to say, unless it wasbecause theAmericenadismissedour Charg6 d'Affaires from Washington. The old year was very mnuch what the Romans olled an ardetio, or mischievous busybody; and if he claimed the merit of delivering us from a great war he left us a pair of ugly little ones in its tlace, one in Persia about a laiy (the eldest cause of rupture etween Europe and Asia), and the other in China for a pmt of etiqutte, our admiral insisting on paying Governor eha visit, and blowing down the waUs of Canton to force a passage to his Excellency's drawing-room. It was one of the eccentricities of the subject of this obituary record that he was much more polite to his enemies than his friends; he was all courtesy and tenderness to Russia, but he buf feted the Chinese con omore, doing his celestial allies more damage with his artillery in a single day than Sir Charles apicr, with his magnificent Baltic fleet, did to the Czar in a whole campaign. On the continent the proceedings of the past 12 months in high places were for the most part nio more to be commended than our domestic doings. Soine of the great Powers behaved very badly; there was even some likeness between their Royal nisdemeanours and those of vulgar and ignoble criminals. The desipns of Prussia against Swvitzerland bore a strong resemblance to the offence of robbery with violence. Her conduct with respect to Neuc.ttel was just as if a highwayman were to conimence operations br picking a quarrel with a traveller, to have a pre. text for nocking him down, and effecting his other purposes. France seemed for a moment inclined to aid and abet Prussia, but France did nothing so ill during the last 12 months as the attack she made on the English orecs, which was like a case of garotting, to strangle freedom of discussion here as it has long since been strangled in Paris. We must say, however, of the French Emperor personally that he was the only man in Europe who in 1856 behaved too well, having incurred a public remonstrance or scolding from one of his own Mtinisters for carrying his princely virtues to a vicious excess. The misdeeds o Russia have been more in the line of swindline, or sometbing between that ersme and the less dignified one of petty larceny. However, the hue and cry was raised in time; and, though she has not been sent to her own Siberia, as she weU deserved, she has at least been compelled to drop her booty. We sincerely pity the Turks wvith such dishonest next-door neighbours. The normal state of Turkey has been that of Notting-hill, and her friends in the Congress of Paris proved themselves about as vigilant and effective as the police of London. As to Austria, her conduct has been Tather shabby than wicked. What could be shabbier than to force herself on the hospitality of the Venetians, who never invited her, and who made no secret of preferring her room to her company? The man who spunges for a dinner ought at least to be an agreeable fellow, not personally offensive to his reluctant host on other grounds as well as the social inxtrusion. We have by no means exhausted our accusations, but let us be just fore we commit our old acquaintance to the tomb of history and " dark backward and abysm of time." He was not without his good points. He was not the monster " nulU4 virtute r-edemptum ;" he left us richer than he found us, notwithstanding the enormous expenses of the war he re-established our relations of friendship and fratermty with the United States; he deserves the praise of having commenced the laying down of the electric wire to connect the old world with the new in the bonds of a nagical intimacy; he did a great deal, to his immortal honour, to smooth down the chief difficulties which have hitherto intercepted the blessings of education from the hulk of the people; and he took a highly popular course towards the close of his days in lifting up his voice against the income-tax, which was in him a most disinterested pro. ceeding, as it was not in the nature of things that he could live to benefit by the reduction. It is, however, devoutly to be wvished that the present may be a year of better manners and conditions, profiting by his predecessor's errors, and departing from his evil ways. Let 1857 put his own house in order, and he will have enough to do; let him keep his hands mnore rigidly from picking and stealing, abstain a little from forging checks and coupons, from prossic acid and strychnine, from bludgeoning, arotting, and housebreaking-in short, from Sad eir and bson, from Palmer and Marley, and all their works. oreover, while distinguishing more nicely between meu,n and alumt in private dealings, let 1857 discriminate better also in public transactions between friend and foo. Pa-ce asijes-bs et dcbctllose eniujeclos is a bad reading of a noble text, and apolicy utterly unworthy of England. We trust the maxim has not been so reversed in China.
FORGED APPEALS FOR CHARITY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Will you, by means of your wide-spread journal, aid me in exposng a system of fraud which is being carried on under the fictitious sanction of my name, and probably under that of many others of the metropolitan clergy ? Several letters have recently been forwarded to me purporting to have been written by me in behalf of some distressed family, sometimes asking the favour of an additional signature to the "highly respectable and influential names" already appended to the "meinorial"-whichb of cours, is only a more indirect miode of seeking immediate pecuniary help. These letters, addressed to persons residing at a considerable distance froni me, as well as toothers in my own neighbourhood, are a; written in the same hand, and couched in the same style. The plani, too, is mnain]. the same. The writer singles out as his victim some lady or gentleman of known benevolence, of which quality he is careful to make honourable mention. He then represents the object of distress generally as a destitute widow ("Foster" and "Clarke" are the favourite names nearly related to faniies whith whom the person address;d happens to be acquainted, and as one whose unblemished integrity and urmnerited misfortunes have occasioned miy sutecial sympathy and exertion in her favour.

CRBDIT MOBILIER. (From House7told Words.) Cr6dit Mobilier ! What can tbose two words, so strangely coupled, mean ? Literally translated, they signify nothing Credit Furniture or Credit Movables are sheer nonsense. Is Cr6dit Mobilier an American city, State, or person; or a recently discovered beast in a Bornean forest ; or an antediluvian predacious monster; or a new species of gulf-weed drifting over the face of the ocean * or a region of the Orest Saharan Desert; or a mouintain composed of mdrvellkuAly minute mssolecules; or an ogre character in a fairy tale ? Perhaps it partakes something of the character of all these different entities. Let us see. Credit Mobilier is a company of a certain class-that is, it is a Socicte Anonyme, and not a Soci6te en Commandite which does not much help us in defining its individuality. In the present paper you must make up your mind to swillow, without chewing them, sundry small morsels of slang of the Bourse; otherwise each unhappy page woald be sunk ap to the armpits in a small-type slough of notes. Cr6dit Mobilier may be a King company, like that inThreadneedlestheet, or a Jeremy Diddler Company, like several we have known to our cost in England. One thing is clear, that it is a Harlequin Company, with a dash of the tyrant, or " Ereles'" vein in it, and is not likely to fall into a dull, moping, hypochondriac way for want of natural quicksllver, asrrogance, and vivacity. Cr6dit Mobilier's dynasty was founded by decree of the 18th of November, 1852, and its official palace is situated at No. 22, Place Vend0me, Paris, The Jupiter from whose brain this Minerva leapt full-armed, shortly after the revolution of July, was Monsieur Emile Pereire (or Peyreire, as he is now called), one of the most distinguished members of the St. Simoman school. M. E. Pereire rose from nothing; he is gifted with the faculty that whatever he touches turns to profit. His name sweeps the crowd of the Bourse before it, as straws before a hurricane. It is enough for him to buy a few shares of anything, no matter what, and the rest are instantly taken up without a question being asked about them. Credit Mobilier's first avatar, in 1S30, wbich took place in the JournaZ du Commerce, was in the guise of a " Conmpagnie d'Assurances Mutuelles pour 1'Escomptc des Effets, &c." In this form she urged her claim to be worshipped as a divinity, on the Government commission, on all the principal bankers and merchants of Paris, and on al the members of the Chamber of Deputies. The statutes of the Soci6tc du Cr6dit Mobilier are essentially the sanie with the pretensions of the new financial goddess, whose Olympic parent presented her, at that epoch, as a samsple of the organizing power of the SaintSimonian doctrine. Cr6dit Mobilier, the second avatar of the same celestial heroine, was at once acknowledged and idolized by the arch high-priests of French finance, whom it would be much too Homeric and too tedious to name. Isaac Pereire, Emile's brother, was on the list, and is now a member of the divinity's council. Sufficient that they forthwith raised her up on an altar on high, and incensed her with thickest stock-jobbing smoke. While people were still asking-as they ask even siet-what is the creed of the new religion, what are its objects, its evidence, its guarantees, and its mode of existence ?-while things were yet thus dim and crude, its promesses d'acliions were bought upataremium. In one instant they rose from 500f. (onuwich 200f only were paid at first) to 1,875f. They have risen as high as 2,000f. On the day when this is written the latest quotation is 1,400f. What became of the clever people who bought at 2,000f. and sold at 1,400f. is one of the countless episodes of the Romance of the Bourse. The annual dividend on each share (originally costing 500f., or 201.) may be roundly stated now as 200f., or 51. sterling. Credit Mobilier is a financial lever of extraordinary power, since it has the right of circulating " obligations" to ten times the amount of its capital as represented by shares. In time of calm it will be sure to divide large profits with its shareholders; but let a crisis come, and there will be such a break-up of the ice as was never seen. Shares risen from 500f. to 1,4000. are not things tobe handled without a lttle hesitaton; a certain degree of caution may be permitted in playing with toys so given to rise and fall. The bazard of the die is enormous. Their great attraction and their lucky sign have been the names of their original creators, who have hitherto pursued a career of unchecked prosperity. The aim of Credit Mobilier is to deal in every species of property quoted at the Bourse; to undertake national and foreign railways-that is, to buy up their shares and sell them again; to subscribe to loans, to build houses in Paris, such as the Hotel du Louvre. It receives, as deposits, stuns of any amiount, paying two per cent. interest, whereas the Bank of France pays no interest. It refunds at sight all sums below 100,000f. (4,0001.), and at three days' sight sums of 100,000f. and upwards. Parties interested in knowin more than this, in short, all they can, have endeavoured to obtain information respecting the company, and have been obliged to content themselves with generalities; such as, " It is an establishment of the highest importance ;" "It uerits respectful attention on account of the respectability of its founders-ood men all -" "it wiU make a sensation in the world" (so nave the Tipperary and the Royal British concerns) ; "it iUwi mark an epoch in history" (so did the South Sea edifice of Mr. Law). Other accounts are less prepossessing. "The assets won't be heavy when it comes to a settlement " " it isa weapon of war for the use of the managers ," "the profits wiU belong to the bodfy of directors, the losses wiU fall to the portion of the shareholders." Finally, common report affords you but little aid to get a clear idea of Credit obiher. The giant apparition remains a mystery. The haziness of outline in which the colossal form is thus able to shroud itself is very much owing both to the faults and the misfortunes of the French press; to its want of liberty, in respect to the trammels twisted round it by the State; and to its want of independence, by lending itself to exterior influence, sometimes to selfish internal interest. In England, Sir John Paul and Co., or the Rtoyal British, could not have coaxed or bribed into silence a single journal of the faintest influence, and, as to any general hushing up to be consented to by the British press as a body, you would as soon get the editors to agree to have their mouths sewn up an their fingers chopped off. In France it is otherwise under whatever influence. French bankers are fond of investing money in journals. Very lately, the owner of eome shares in a provincial company did not like them; and I should wonder, knowing them, if he did. As a means of getting rid of them, lie wanted to advertise them in the pvincial journal as on sale at 26Ier cent. below prime cost. e editorrefused to insert theadvertisement, from motives which it is not for us to investigate or impugn ; and the would-be advertiser brought his action for dommanges int6r6ls as one means of publicity and of taking a rise out of the concern. To show the way in wbich provincial editorssonietimes do business, the prosecutor's counsel told the following tale:- A nrc-handcsdepapies, or female paper-merchant, took an advertisement of her wares to a country newspaper, whose r6yisscur was proprietor, printer, and all. Thegentle. man refused to insert the announcement. " Why not?" asked the lady in astonlishment. " Here's the money down, if you are afraid of that." H Heu, hex !" said the editor- " I neither want your money, nor your advertisement, Madame. I. too, sell paper, Madame-foolscap, quarto, letter-paper, fine, coarse, and demi-fine, besides envelopes, cards, and letters of fairec-parof deaths and marriages, all in the newest style, a very large assortment, MIadame. I cannot publish the advertisement youany onve, who wo d undersell my paper. W hat would The lady, too proud to make vain remonstrance, went her way. In a few days she returned to the office, and humbly "Monsieur, have you an attic to let 5" "What do you mean, Madame? I don't understand your question. Pray, what project can you have with respect to my attic 1 "Before I can explain my intentions," the fair merchant an attic to let"u ust answer y question, 'whether you have "No, hadame, I have not." "Very well, Monsieur. I can now proceed to business Without fear of interruption. Please to insert this in your next number. I have an attic to let; but I thought I would ask whethler you had one to let also, before I ventured to bring the advertisement. For reliable information, therefore, as to Cr6dit Mobilier, we are obliged, like others, to refer to the statutes of the company. There we find- The founders, considering the important services to be rendered by the establisliment of a Soci6te having for its object to encourage the developmcnt of industry and public works, and to effect, by consolidation into a common fund, the conversion of the special vouchers and title deeds of diverse undertakings, have resolved to realize so useful a work, and to that intent have determined the bases and the statutes of a Socidtrd Anonyme,under the denomination of Soci6t,l Gdn6rale de Credit Mohiier. The duration of the Soci6t6 is 99 -years. The social capital is fixed at 60,000, 000 (of francs, which will be always understood when not exoressed otherwise), divided into 120,000 actions or sliares of 500f. each. (Divide by 25, and you get pounds sterling.) A first series of 40,000 actions or shares only is issued at present. The remaining80,000 shall be successively issued on the decision of the Council of Administration from time to time, according to the wants of the Societc. They shall not be delivered below par. The founders and the holders of the first issued shares have the rsght of preference in subscribing at par for the shares to he issued, in the proportion of one-third for the founders and of two-third for the shareholders. The definitive vouchers (dItres) of the shares belong to the bearer. The partial payments are stated by a certificate delivered to the subscriber, negotiable by way of transfer. The original subscriber and the persons to whom shares have been ceded are liable teoa claim until the integral amount of such shares has been paid. (The whole number of shares has since been issued, and the whole amount of each share paid up.) The o.semblec is composed of the 200 largest shareholders. Each of them has a vote for every 40 shares which he holds ; only no individual person can ave more than five votes. The net profits are an- nually disposed of thus-first, 5 per cent, on the capital of the shares issued; secondly, 5 per cent. forthe reserve fund, the nscimue of which is fixed at 2,000,000, The surplus iS distributed in the form of dividends in the proportion of one-tenth for the administrators, and nine-tenths for the shares. Article S of the statutes defines the object of the company. The operations of the Soci6t6 shall consist-first, in subscribing to or acquiring public property (effets), the shares or the obligations of the different indastrial or financial enterprises, constituted as Soci6t6s Anonymes, and notably those of railways, canals, mnines, and other public works, already founded, or to be founded. Secondly (wbich please mark 'well), in issuing its own obligations for a sum equal to that employed for these subecriptions and acquisitions. Thirdly, in selling or in giving as security for loans all acquired property, shares, and obligations, and in obanging them for other property (vaceurm). Fourthly, in subscribmg (soumiesioner) for all loans, in ranting them and realzing them, as 'well as all undertakigs of public 'works. Fithily, in lending eon public property, on deposits of shares and obligations, and in opening credits of current accounts on the deposit of these diverse Properties. Sixthly, in receiving sums in current account. Seventhly, an effecting all receipts (recoursn-enns) in behalf of tbe aforesaid companies, in paying their couons -ofdnterest or of diviudends, and generally all other orders. Bightb]y, in keeping a bank of deposit for the vouchers of ibaeor$erprises It is expresl7Usglstg tadel Xb socity shall never make "r entrs d c,gUvScrl-that is, shaU not sell property of which it is not possessed-nor make " aec"ts 2 prirnie-that is, gambling purchases of a peculiar nature ,which would require a quarter of a page of foot-note to explain to the uninitiated. By article 6 all other operations are prohibited. It is expressly understood that the Soci6tc wiD never make readymoney sales nor purchases at a premium. CrEdit MoI bilier, therefore, regarded in the light of economic I science, is an industrial bank, a vast undertaking of sleep. ing partners; it is an enormous joint-stock bank whose custouers are themselves capitalists and bankers. As far as the operations of the Bourse are concerned, it is a centralization of stock-jobbing. The Credit Foncier, without exposing itself to be laid quitebare,outsteps the BankofErance in boldness by issuing a number of obligations equal to the amount of its loans on mortgage. But Cr6dit Mobilier approaches the verge of temerity. By article seven ofthestatutes, until the complete issue of the shares, the obligations created by the Soci6t6 must not exceed five times the capital realized. After the complete issue of the social fund (ehat is, now), they may reach a sum equal to ten timesthe capital-that is to say, with60,000,000capital it can issue 600,000,000 obligations. And what is the guarantee of these obligations? Just this-the fundamental capital pltts an equal sum employed in the subscription to and the acquisition of public property and the shares of companies! W'hether such a guarantee is altogether Muso-y is not for us to say, because the grand smash has not yetcome. After it has come we may say what we like. Mcking the stable door ever so fast will not bring back the stolen horse any more than floods of bitterest milkmaid's tears will restore spilt milk to the miLkpail again. The slightest fall at the Bonrse must depreciate the pledges in the shape of pnblic property and shares of companies; and the capital o sbares is also reduced. If the paper vouchers suffer a diminution of value of only one-tenth, the capital of shares is absorbed, and the SociCt6 become actuaDy banksupt. An institution which should lend on securities and on mortgages a sum equal to the reputed value of the pledge would expose itself to danger, because thero is no certainty that a sale would produce the price estimated. This is exactly the case with Credit Mobilier. Cr6dit Mobilier, on its own account, acquires, at its own risk and peril, shares and vouchezs; it becomes absolute proprietor of them. It has no further claim on the seUers fromn the instant of their delivery into its hands. Depreciation in value is its affair, and nobody else's, as rise in value will be its profit. If, then, after it has purchased its 600,000,000 worth of property-if there come a fail-that prorerty is no longer any guarantee for' its 600,000,000 of obligations issued. And, as its capital only amounts to one-ternth of what it is liable for, and the shareholders are only answerable for the amount of their quota, the faU of a tenth annihilates Cr6dit Mobilier's substance, and reduces it to insolvency. As an instrument of circulation and stock-jobbing the organization of the general society is the conception of a master spirt. It betrays at once the nationality of its author and the revolutionary spirit of its early days. The kings of the Bourse, with their capitals of from 10,000,000 to 100,000,000, can, now-a-days, produce a fall or arise at their pleasure- but they shrink into dwarf and vulgar proportions in the presence of an institution which is able to dispose of 600,00,000, and is capable of purchasing in a single day al the railway er canal shares that are for sale on the market. Crddit Mobilier can make scarcity or plenty, vacuum, or over-supply ; it is a gigantic monopoly, out of whose pale there is no salvation for the speculator. Everybody not comprised witbin it will henceforth have nothing to do but to pay. Under such conditions its obligations will doubtless be constantly guaranteed. Nevertheless, if one day or other, the payers should become disgusted and discouraged-if the knowing ones should enlist under the Soci6t6's banner-if, in short, there should be no more antagonmsts, with whom, then, wiU the game be played? Who will pay the difference? Or, if the isolated speculators should form a coalition against the monopoly, and organize army to meet army,-if the grand mass of producers, capitalists, and merchants should rise in insurrection,-coercive measures being impossible, what chance of safety wiUl the company have Ieft them ? After this peep at the general society let us see what are guarantees for the shareholders. The Soci6t6 is administered by a council of 15 members, renewed from year to year by a fifth of their number, and constantly re-eligible. Article 28 of the statutes gives to the council the most extended powers for the administration of the company's affairs; notably, the council authorizes by its delberations all purchase or sales of shares or obligations, all credits, all subscriptions, cessions and realizations of loass, all ad. vances on deposits of property, and, generally, all treaties, transactions, compromises, callings-in of funds, transfers, sums borrowed on deposits of the obligations, or other property of the company, purchases of objets mobi- i`ers, and, finaly, aU judiciary acts, both in suing and defending. It decides on the employment of unemployed funds. It makes the regulations of the company. It authorizes the expenses of the administration, It names and revokes the principal agents of the Soci6te. It determines theirfunctions, and fixes their salaries, perquisite<, and privileges. By article 10 the members of the counci do not contract,in consequence of their proceedings as managers, the slghtest personal obligation, This immunity is the common rule in al Societes Anonymes. Consequentl, we bavhere members who have the disposal of the Soci6te's substance as if it were their own, without being responsible for any stroke of bad luck. It is true, they are obliged to deposit 200 shares as a guarantee for the rectitude of their administration-; that is, tbey givea joint secityto the amount of what cost them lw,00, OL-a very pretty pledge to be given by a knot of gentlemen who may play rouge-et-noir with some 25,000,000 of English pounds sterling, if they like. The members of the council are aU shareholders, or even directors, of some scheme or other. The greater part of their fortune consists of negotiable paper. They authorize, as administrators of the general society, all purchases or sales of shares or obligations, all credit, &c. There is nothing, therefore, to preventh. Ernest Andre, the Dac de Galliera, Baron Seilli6re (the names are real), and the rest, administrators, frons buying of Monsieur Ernest Andrd1 the Duo de Galliera, Baron Seillire, and the rest, pnvate individuals, on account of Credit Mlobiler, the shares and obligations of which they are the owners. It is a lawful operation, by wbich all parties may be benefitted. It is true, the purchases are made at the current price; bat we must not forget that the general society can cause a rise or fall at pleasure. Certainly, the share which the sleeping partners have in controlling matters and in taling the initiative is but trifling. The general assembly is. only composed of the two hundred largest shareholders,who wil notau answer to their summons. The assembly is regularly constituted when the members present are 40 in number, and when they jointly hold the tenth part of the shares issued. If these conditions be not fulfilled a second summons is issued ; and then the members present hold a valid and formal meeting, whatever may be their number or the value of their shares. The possession of 40 shares is necessary to confer a vote. It will scarcely be believed that this select body of shareholders has not the right of proposing any measare. According to article 51, the order of the day is decreed by the Council of Administration. On it shall appear only propositions emanating from this council, and those which have been laid before it at least 15 days previous to the convocation of the general assembly, with the sinature of the members of that assembly. But the list of merabereis drawn up only a month before the convocation; and the propositions, signed by ten members, must be sent in to the council at least 15 days before this very convocation. The precautions are excelent to prevent conspiracy and rebellion among discontented sharehiolders. It is some slight consolation to know that the general company, like al Socikt6s Anonymes, is placed under Government control, and that its statutes are modifiable. M. Isaac Pereire tells us:-" The creation of the banknote has been one of the greatest strides, one of the most beautiful applications of credit; but by the side of the bank-note there rests a vacant place, which our obligations are called upon to fill. The principal of these obligations being to be repayable only at an epoch correspondmngeto that of the property which they represent in ourpoitefeuaie, and to bear interest to the profit of the holder, their issue is exempt from every inconvenience. In accordance with the economy which serves as the basis of our society, these vouchers are not only pledged ( gqag6s) by property of corresponding amount acquired under Government control, and whose union offers, by the application of the principle of mutuality, the advantages of the compensation and the division of risks; but t,hey wiU have moreover the guarantee of a csital which we have raised with this object, to a considerab y high figure 160,000,000.)" But interested parties may talk til they are tired. An institution of credit, like the Credit Mobilier, useful, even necessary, in respect to its object, has outgrown the proportions and range of action allowed to private companiea. An institxtion which can only exist by the support of the public faith, cannot be made use of for the furtherance of private interests. Such an application of its powers is nothing less than a fraudulent abuse; and the authorities who tolerate it, and the speculators who make it their tool, incur-the one the blame of the nation, the other the censure of honest men. As to buying in now, or at any other time, every one must judge for himself, just as every one must form his own decision whether he will dance a fandango on a cracked tight-rope, whether he will cross an Al~pime ravine on a rotten plank, or whether he will plunge his hand into a smooth-surfaced caldron or oil with a brisk fire burning beneath it.
REGISTBATION OF SHIPS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Permit me 40 add my testimony to that of Mr. Atherton to the importance of adopting a mode of registration of ships that would encourage 'merchants to adopt those of the best form, by which I mean those in which the economic is notipacrificed to fancy and " false facts." Such mode should allow for the application of a useful amount of steam power, but discourage any unnecessary amount as an unwise charge upon the public, who, after all, pay for private vagaries more generally than is supposed. The general adoption of the best formed ships, and the apphication of only the due amount of steam power to ateamvesse]s, vvould be attended with a saving of millions annually. Naval architecture is an experimental science, for, though certain mathematical conclusions have been arrived at, these refer to the exceptional rather than the normal oondi. tions under which ships are placed, and yet we have no statistics on that subject-at least, none that3 deserve that name. Ihave the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servant- Xb tMJIN15kC -'HROTTPnr. Captain, XN. United Service Club, Jan. 2.

The Commissioner held that the petitioning creditor's debt (that of the Royal British Bank for about 40,0001) had been proved, as also an act of bankruptcy. Adjudicationof bankraptcywas accordingly made. Mr. Patnck Johnson is the offlcial assignee. Messrs. Link. later and Hackwood are the xolicitors in the case.

No opposition was offered, eapplcation was granted. (Before Afr. Commiesioner MURPHY.) UT RE JA"NES RUCK. Mr. TEIRtY appeared to oppose in this case for the Rev, MIr.Hoee, of Dunstable, but an objection was taken that a tereWas no specific anthority from the creditor to oppose. It was stated that MIr. lIose had given a general power of attorney to transact all business, but it was contended by Ir. Reed, npon the authority of cases quoted in Macrec's Thsofvency Pract*ce that a general power of attorney did not warrant an opposition in this court. ir. Comumision er MIURPHIY adopted that view, and adjourned the case until Tuesday in order that the power of attorney might be produced and its termus ascertained.
MIDDLESEX SEssro u, Ja. 3. (Before thc A s?sr-Juncr4 ai Cekr1e7nucM) Joseph Wilkinson, the grocer vho wvas fonnd Guilty on Frid.ay of having felonionsly received somne drapery goods, knowing them to have been stolen, wras brought up for 3udgment, and sentenced to hard labour for 18 calendar months. Mr. Sleigh appeared on behalf of the prosecution. Henry Johnson was indicted for stealing a watch valued at 3l. from the person of Henry Hosmer. Mr. Tayler was for the prosecution ; Mr. Payne appeared for the prisoner. At about 3 o'clock on the morning of the 27th of December the prosecutor was standing in front of the bar at the Spread agle Tavern, Kingsland-road, when the prisoner pushed up to him, and immediately afterwards he felt a pull at his watchchain. The prisoner then made for the door, and the prosecutor, having missed his watcb, went after him. He caught him some yards from the door and accused him of the theft. He tried to get away,but finding he could not, he took the watch out of his pocket and threw it on the ground. He was then given into custody. The jury found the prisoner Guifty. It was sbown that he was one of the most expert and successful members of the sweeU mob, and, though he had been previously convicted, he had been very lacky in escaping apprehension. The ASSIsrNT-JUDGE sentenced him to four yeare penal servitude. (Before Mr. CREASY.) William Clayton was indicted for an assault, and was CObwictcd. This was a cross indictment arising out of a case tried on Thursday, when three persons, named Jones, Tripp, and Holmes, were convicted of an assault upon Clayton, the present defendant. All the parties were engaged in the piano-maleig trade; a difference took place, and violence was resorted to. On the four defendants being caUed up, Mtr. CREAsY said, it was to be regretted that workmen, wbo, as a body were entitled to the highest respect, should mix up in such proceedings as had resulted in these two indictments; they ought to evice a more friendly and conciliatory feeling towards each other. After a kind admonition he sentenced them to pay a fine of OA. each. lir. Sleigh was for the prosecution. Catherine Hoare and Henry Johnson were tried and Conticted on a charge of robbing a man named Ash of lgs. 6d. The woman was sentenced to six months' hard labonr; and the man, who was an old offender, to four years' penal servitude. The policeman in the case, one of the C.ty force, had produced some money (about Ss.) which he had found upon Johnson, and it seemed that when the case ws over he left the court with the witnesses without taking the money from the table upon which it was placed when produced. Some time afterwards he came back and inquired for it, but it was gone, and no one knew anything of it. The Court adjourned for a few minutes when the case was concluded, and it is supposed that some stranger who remained might have seen it lying on the table, and no one being .near put it in his pocket and walked away.
POLICE. MAYSION-UOUSM-The LoBD MAYOB requested that the press would acknowledge the receipt of the folowing donations to the poorbox :-from the Rev. E. W. Sheppard, 51.- from "S. D.," of Notliss, 51.; from "EL C.,' 51. Gv1nTDELT-Satvray having been fixed for the fnrtber investigation of the Samarhian Institution case, Mr. Surr Edward Pack Barber, the secretary, appeared before Sir RE. W. CA}CDt and Alderman HT,.[PmtP.Y, on bail, to answer four separate charges of obtaining under fale pretences one barrel of porter of Messr Manners and Wells one sack- of flour of Mess. Ponsford and Co. of the City Flonrmil3s, one barrel of porter of Messrs. Hoare and Co., and one barrel of bicuits of Messrs. Huntley and Palmer of Reading, with intent to defraud those finns. For the greater accommodation of the public the case was heard in the Court of Common Pleas, GuildhalL M2r. Sleigh, instructed by lfr. Buchanan, app,eared, as before, on the part of the prosecution, and Mr. Joyce, ins'ructed by MWr. tiorsley, for the defence. The depositions talren at the last examination were then reaedover by MIr. Martin (the chief clerk), and verified by Mr. Joyce addressed the Bench at great length in defence of his client, and concluded by saying be would lrove all he had stated, and if he proved all he thought he should be able to do he would ask the magistrate if this was not a complete nswer to all these charges, and when Mr. Barber's evidence, as it would, went forth upon the wings of of the press to the public he would come clear out of this matter, and then it would be a question if Mr. Potter's share in these proceedings did not call for condemnation rather than pralse. He would call one witnems now, and then consent to an adjournment. Mr. Sleigh said he was prepared to go on with the case until the conclusion, or adjourn at once. The evidence in support of this statement was then postponed until Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Barber entering into the same securities as before. The court was very rauch crowded throughout the leared counsel's address, which lasted about three hour Bow-sTRErr.-The manager and company of a penny theatre, No. 167, Holbomn, were brought before Mr. EY.N-R on Saturday, charged, the former with keeping an unlicensed house for the representation of dramatic pieces, the latter with taking part m such performances. The prisoners were 1-3in number:-viz., Tbomas Catterall, the manager, and Selina CatteralL his wife- fiv gerformers, nacnd Christina Belascoe, Williami relL Solomon Belascoe, and George Riley; William Weaver a musician; John Walters, money-taker; Thomas Shine check-taker; John Thomas, attendant in the refreshmentroom; and William Leigh, the father-in-law of Catterall, and former proprietor of the establishment. Mr HENSB, after commenting on the pernicios tendency of these exhibitions, said he had no doubt Catterall knew he was doing wrong,as hemustbe aware that the house bad been indicted as a nuisance. He was liable, as principal, to be fined 201, or even to be sent to prison for two months, without the option of paying a fine at alL As this was the first case in the district,it would not be necessary to enforce the latter penalty, but he must pay the fine of 201. or be committed for one month. The others for assisting or being present were liable to a fine of 40s, and he (3r. Henry) mnust inflict that penalty on Leigh, wh;: had evidently shared in the direction of the proceedings. In denault, he must be committed for 14 davs. The others had apparently acted under their instrncffons, probably without knowing that they were doing wrong. It would be suflicient for these to enter into recognirances for 101. to appear on that day fortnight, when, if they did not reet the offence, no penalty would be inficted e Mr HNott Y has received a donation of 51 from "S. D.," of NoWtta' KAItYL=oNO--" S. L." has forwarded 5L. for the poorbox of this court. The like amount has been received for the same benevolent object from " E. C." WoPss -STR. T.x On Saturday Harriette JiUles, a girl of 17, but in appearance about 25, was charged with at. tem pted suicide. The case exhibited one of those reckless acts that girls of the prisoner's age occasionally commit, with or without an adequate reason, and was only worth notice on account of thepraisevorthy conduct of a policeman named Kidd, ofthe dvision. aewas ing over the Kingslandroad-bridge at 1 o'clock in the day on Sunday three week's. when he heard a voice exclaim, "ICan bear this no longer!' and the next minute the prisoner sprang as far as she could from the edge of a stone-wharf into the Regent'sCanal,which is there 9 feet deep. He instantly ran down to the wharf, and, pulhing off his top coat, jumped in after her. The girl had sunk once, but rose to the surface, and immediately seized the officer with such desperate energythat, as heknew very little of swimming, she very nearly drowned both him and herself. By a violent effort, however, he contrived to loosan her grasp, and pushed her by main force, the prisoner trying again to get hold of him, to the bank of the canal, where some people had by this time collected and dragged her out. She was at once carried to ths workhouse, which was near at hand, but suffered so severely from her inmersion that a whole week elapsed before she was able to be brought to the court. The prisoner then alleged that bse had formed an attachment for some young man, but that his relatives had said something about her affecting her character, and she had therefcre determined to destroy herself. The magistrate then remanded her that she might receive the adviceandreligiousconsolationof the prison chaplain, but on being led into the clerles room she first became excited, then hysterical, and was finally seized with fainting fits, from which there was some difficulty in restoring her. On Saturday she anpeared both contrite and collected, and, havzg *x~pressed regret for her folly, andpromised never to repeat such an act, she was delivered up to her Friends, who engaged to take care of The magistrate u.pon both occasions warmly praised the courae and intrepidity of the officer, who bad Po nearly lost his life in saving that of the girl, and handed him a soveregn from a member of the Athenneum Club, using the Intial s "P. H. L," the gentleman expressing himself in terms of admiration of the constable's conduct. "IWBrrT-Join Plumley, a yotug fellow whose friends 'w9 sa4d to bh mod respe4t%ble Fwas placed at tbh bar l'tfore the Hon. G. C. NORTON on a charge of uttering no le.s than six forged notes. Sergeant Coppin, of the P division of police, depos d that in the month of May last a person named Charles Langdon, then a waiter at the Flora-gardens, Camberwell, was taken into custody by him and committed from this court on a charge of passing forged niotes to the publicans in the neighbourhood of the Camberwell New-road, and hLs defenee was that he had reeived the notes from the present prisoner, who was at that time a checktaker at the seme gardens, and this defence suocoeded at the Old Bailey, as Langdon was cuitted. The prsoner Plumley xt that time absconded, and though he (Coppin) had made every effort to apprehend him be did not succeed. On the day before, from information he recved, he proceeded to Sheerness, where the prisoner went by the name of George Sinclair, and there apprehended him. He rold him what he took him into eustody for,-namely,for pasing six forged 5-notes on diferent persons, and he acknowledged the fact. In conclusion, Coppin said he had not sufficent time to get the whole of tho witnesses in attendance that day, and, after the evideneo of one gentleman, he should request his Worship to remand the prsoner toafuture day. Mr Pletcher, the landlord of the Clarendon Anns publichouse, Camberwell New-road, identified the prisoner as tho person for whom he had changed a 51 forged note then produced, and said he saw him write the nmme on the back. The prisoner, who offered nothing in defence, was remindod to a future day. Juia Manning, a well-dressed and very good-looking yonmg woman, was brought up for final examination on a chJe of attempting slf-destruction by throwng herwlf off the Hungerford Suspension-bridge w When charged con the day before the prisoner said that on Thursday morning a young Scotchman to whom she had been very much attached had started for Edinburgh, and she became so disconsolAto at his leavi herthat sh drank rather freely, and hardly knew what xhe was about. She expressed her tbanks to the constable who had prevented her from throwing herself over the bridge into the Thames, and hop the mr te would discharge ber. Mr.NorrTos, howerer, thought it desimble that her friendsshouldbe made acquaintedwithher conduct, particularly as she had told the offioer who saved her from drowning that it was no use, as she had made up her mind to destroy life on the first favourable opportunity that presented itself, and remanded her for the purpose. On Saturday her mother, a very decent-looking woman, was i attendance, and sad that her datghter wvas married, but lived apart from her husband on account of his ilblussre. The prisoner, who evidently felt annoyed at the disclo. sure made by her mother, begged hard for forgiveness, and declared solemnuly he would never attempt such an act again. MIr. N-OP.rOr observed that her attachment, as a married woman, to the young Sootchman was a very queer business, but ultimately consented to her discharge.

ZXECUTIONYS AT MALTA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The Timet of yesterday contains a letter f7vn Mr. Bawyer condemning the Protestant and landing the Romish mode of dealing with capital convicts, with its coddling and comforting, and the awful procession of the " confraterniti de miserecordia" to the gallows. The description is very c-.mplete, only Mr. Bowyer has forgotten to teU Us all about the luxnrious supper which the said " confraternitA" furnishes to the unhappy criminal after the " capella," on the night before he expiates his crimes, Considering Mr. Bowyer's bim in favour of Ronmish institutions, on the principle of audi atfera mpa, perhaps you will give a corner to one who has residd many yexrs Sn the south of Europe, and whose opportunities oi observing the working of the Romish system were probably not inferior to Mr. Bowyer's, and who eertainly has no desire to see any of the much-landed confraternitis" established in this country. As example, they say, teaches better than precept, I shall at once proceed to narrate the facts of a case of murder at a place notoriously the roost Romnhh in Europe, -I mean Malta-w hich took place on the 1st of January, Tho victmin this ease w a widowr livn alone in her house, She had considerable property about her, consisting of silver plate, gold trinkets, kc. The murderers (two men and a woman) gained admittance on pretence of a fziendly visit. It was a most cruel murder, the poor victim offerirg tbem aU she had to spare her Ihfe. One remarkable incider' occurred dnrinD the commission of the murder, whicheould only take plaec in a country producing Mr. Bowyer's favourite "confraternitL" Whhile one of the murderers was compressing the throat of the poor woman another was sayithe prayers of the dying over her, actually invoking the ightyat the very moment they were destroying His image The awful deed done and the valuable effects plundered, in due time the murderers repaired to the " confessional," where they were sentenced to do penance, to gve one portion of the plunder for masses for the soul of the deceased, a second portion for " cariti" to the Church and the third portion, suppose, they were alUowed to ieep for themseves-and then " absolution !" Does not this look very like reseling stolen goods on the part of the Church which Mr. Bowyer admires so much 1 Bad as all this is, much worse remains behind, showing the low standard of morality in Ualta, the chosen abode of Romanism, where all its institutaons and " confratermitas " are in full feather. I know it to be a positive fact that, although the murderers were well-known to every man, woman, and child in the placc, they were not denounoedray, although the murderers themselves perfectly well knew that they were khown yet they never tned to escape, which they could easily have done. They were indeed executed the following year, but not before they had committed another horrid murder. These are fats patent to any one who will read the murerers' confession, msde to a priest, and published after their execution with the criminals' previous sanction, in the Malta a v Gace, some time in 1829, but the exact date I do not remember. Everybody knows, so I may merely alluds to the fact, that murders in the south of Europe are fourfold what they are in Englamd. I knew eight in one yeAr in Malta, cut of a population of 100,000, not one of which was ever discovered, although Government offured lrge rewards; this does not look as if Mr. Bowyer's awful processions of tho ' onfaternit had any very prominent deterrent effect. Your obedient servant. TRUTH; Of.". d. 2

AMERICA. (BY ELECrTIC TELEGRAI'H.) LIVEPPOOL, Jss. 4. The Royal mail steamship Africa has arrived, 'with advices from New York to the 24th of December and 50,0001. in specie on freight, The Canada, hence, arrived at Halifax on the 23d of December. On the 25th of December, at G p.m., the Africa passed a large steamer bound wvestward, and on the following day the screwv steamship Edinburgh, from Glasgow for New York. In Congress the discussion on the President's MIessage had been continued and adjourned. The application to the President by the gentlemen connected with the Atlantic telegraph to solicit his patronage to the scheme had been crowned with success. The President had issued an order for the arrest of Cornelius K. Garrison, Charles Morgan, and General William Walker, to answer the Accessory Transit Company in a plea of trespass for converting and disposing of the goods and chattels of the company to the value of $1,000,000, and also a further sum of $1,000,000 damages for interrupting, their business. There had been a large meeting in New York for the purpose of devising the proper nanner and seeking the means to send material aid to WValkker. The Herald, remarking on it, says "I t is a singular evidence of the tone and tendency of popular opinion among the better classes of society here that several of the most fashionable and leading hotels should have come publicly forward wvith contributions. The St. Nicholas Hotel sends 100 barrels of bread, the Metro. politaii Hotel, 5,0001b. of bacon, and the guests of several ether popular houses send in contributions of money. There is another contribution that has rather an ominous look1,000 rifles." At the earnest request of Walker's discarded envoy, Goicouria, Mr. Roberts, of the United States' Steamship Company, had consented to le' one of his steamers call at Greytown, to relieve those misguided Fillibusters who were in a starving condition. At New York, wbile lying at the pier, the steani ship KInoxville, of the Savannah line, had been d&stroyed by fire. Some fishermen engaged on the western edge of the Grand Bank, about 50 miles from land, had hooked some wreck, 'which is supposed to be the American mail steamer Arctic, which sank in 1854. It is stated that it will be several weeks before the .Adiiatic is ready for sea. The New York and Liverpool packet ship New York went ashore on the night of the 19th, two niles from Basnegat inlet. Next morning the ,second mate and six men succeeded in landing with a rope in one of the ship's boats ; the passengers were afterwards landed in safety. The captain (M'linnon) was brutally ill-used and seriously injured by seven of his crew, while endeamouring to suppress insubordination. He snapped a pistol at one man; it missed fire, and he was knocked down, and but for the mate, who stood over him, would have been m urdered. The mate also was in great danger, but one of the mutineers tooki his part. Next day the man was killed by his comrades. For four days and nights the emigrants, 300 in ntmiber, remained without shelter or food of any kind on the bleak coast. In the same gale the brig Tasso, of St. John's, Newfoundland, was wrecked. Four of her crew and two men who had gone off from the beach were drowned attempting to get ashore. The negro insurrection excitement had not ceased. A despatch from Louisville of the 20th of December says:- "The.RtwesslUle Herald of Wednesday last says that the negro insurrection excitement exists in the neighbourhood of Volney and Gordonsville. A number of negroes had been arrested; a negro at one of the iron wvorks in Tennessee said he krew au about the plot, hut would die before he would tell. He thereupon received 750 lashes, from wlich he died. At Cadiz, Trig county, Kentucky, a free negro was hung after being tried by a Vigilance Commnitteo. There are a numnber more in gaol, some of whom will be hang. Judge Cook has called a meeting of the Court for Christmas-day. Excitement runs very high." Havannah advices are to the 15th of December. The stock of sugar on hand was 65,000 boxes, aud at MIatanzas 3,00( boxes; molasses contracts made freely at 71s to 8 rials per keg of 5J- gallons for clayed ; muscovado molasses, 8 to 91 ditto. In the New York monev-market the demand continued active and the supply adequate at 9 to I0 per cent. for first class 30 to (60 days' paper, 12 to 15 per cent. for second-class. In exchange the demand for remittances was very limited, and continental lower. Bills on London at 8; to 9 per cent. pm. ; Paris, 5.20 to 5.211 ; Hamburg, 30is to 36G. Stock transactions were limited and the market steady. Railroad bonds firm, but inactive. The cotton-market was about one-eighth of a cent better, owing to the advices frorm the south of a probable short crop, and a very general belief that the yield would not exceed 3,O0tJ,OOO bales ; the market closed iirm. In the flour-nmarket the Canada's advices had added to the dulness. Canada in mioderate supply, at from $6 40c. to $7 7 0c. for superfine to best extra; southern in good reqjuest for export, and buoyant. Red and white wheat firmer, on account of scarcity ; the home prices had a restiicting tendency. Pork irregular; mess a shade better, price lower, stock moderate. Beef in better demand, partly speculative, and prices slightly higher ; stock moderate, and holders indifferent about selling. Lard lc. to ac. lower. Cheese firmer. Prume North Country crude turpentine held at $3 50c., and Ilmington sold at $3 431c. Spirits of turpentine much iirmer; 43c., cash, had been refused, and sales made at a higher rate. WVhite resin scarce, and w.onted at full prices. Salt in bulk dull. Freights firmer to this port, and the business moderate, at O d. to Gld. for corn and wheat, Is.

A NOVEL WAYt.-We learn fronm the last batch of papers forwarded to us by our Calcutta correspondent that another Indian war is on the eve of breakirng out. Indian wars hav. been of such frequent occurrence since the British got footing in the great Asiatic peninsula that this intelligence will not, of conrse, niucl surprise our readers. But the war which is now impending there is of an extraordinary and unique character, and different in every respect from all that ever went beforo it. It is not ag,inst a Hyder Ali or a Tippoo Saib; it is not against the fanatical Sikhs or the heroic Affghans that this var is to be waged. The enemy with vhich the British will now have to contend is of a more savage and sanguinary nature than even they ; and the accounts of him which we glean from our Iudian apers recall to our memory those half-discredited stories that ierodotus tells us about the terrific iimonsters which spread dismay among the little communities of Hellas in the mythical ages. The war, in fact, which the British are now about to wags in India will be a war against tigers, not mnn. It is with tie quadruped. not the biped, of the forest that the masters of that great country wvill now have to do battle. Nor will this war be offenisive on their part, but purely defensive. The enerny has been in the presernt instance the aggressor. do has rushied mit of hib jungles and fastuiesses, and devastated their territory, and put their peop?e to Iighlt, so that the lauid is now a wildermamsm. and its immhabitants too p.or to pay the accustoumed tribute. In a word, an army of tigers hAs invaded a district of the Nerhuddah territory, driven away its occupiers, taken forcible pf,ssession of their piropertv, and left the Anglo-Indian Government mnmes a revenue wLviclh amounted annually to a lakh and fifty thousand rupees. Here was surely a cmari belli more valid than that wvsichi had given rise to the P.ussoTurkish %var, und accordlinigly the Governor-Gener.l has proclaimlled hostiliti2s against the invaders, and is at present busilyengaged drunminrgupvoluntetrs for the contemplated expedition, promi-ing to furnish elephants, shikaries, and all expenses to those who will coorme for,vard and enroll 'thenmselves as ctndidates for glory in this tiger war. The urnals don't say what warrior is to command the Volunteer Corp-, hutt doabtless some chief high in reputa. tion among the Intdian Generals will receive the appointment. -Whether the felines will be able to hold their own against the force which is about to be sent to oppose them we shall not venture to predict, but even the Britishers. vho are apt to underrate the prolvess and strength of their foes, admit that-it will take at least two sanguinary campaigns to extirpate and overcome tigerdom. I due season we shaU of course bh apprised of the result. Be this, however, what] At may, one thing is already certain, that never yet have the' ;EPglish been engaged in such anotber contest, or with such I anwther enemy since the day when Hengist and Hors& first I led tbem to the conquest and colonization of Britain. We "ase aAaened the tiger war net unworthy of this brief notice, both becm.use of its singular and abnormal nature, an be-. cause it reveals a phase of Indian social life no' generally cupposed to exist.- JA'a, C or Times.
HEB WEST INDIA AND MEXICAN MAILS. SOUTHAMPTON, JA2x. 4. The R~ogal Mail Company's steamer Orinoco, Captain T. W. Sawyer, arrived to-day writh the mails from the West Indies, Mexico, and the Pacific, in char~ge of Lieutenant Inglis, R.N. HIer dates are: TamDico ... Dec. Vera Cruz ... ... Havannah ... ..

She also brings home some of the Wye's missing mails. The Orinoco brings 35 passengers, two distressed British seamen, and one naval invalid, 978,589 dollars in specie, and a cargo consisting of 44 serons of cochineal, 26 scrons of jalap, 195 cases of cigars, 104 bales of tobacco, 157 bales of sarsaparilla, 12 casks of ginger, 388 bags of cocoa, 29 kegs of arrowroot, 1 bale of skins, and 361 packages of sundries. On her homeward voyage the Orinoco experienced, from the 17th to the 23d iilt. inclusive, strong N.E. winds, with a very heavy head sea; from the 24th to the 26th, moderate S.E. breeze; from the 27th to the 2d of January fresh breeze from the S.W., and on entering the Chasmel a strong gale from the W. Our Jamaica letters of the 11th ult. inform us that since the departure of the last mails the events which had transpired were scarcely worthy of any notice. The business of the session was progressing steadily and in some way as harmoniously as could be anticipated under the circumstances. The motion of Mr. Porteous respecting the importation of slaves into Cuba had been withdrawn under the idea that it would be undignified in the island Legislature to petition Parliament on that subject. There were rumours, however, that public meetings would be held for the purpose of memorializing the Imperial Government. The death of the Hon. Mr. Shirley, Custos of Trelawny, and senior member of Assembly for that parish, had thrown great gloom over the island. He was a large landed proprietor, and considered one of the wealthiest men in the colony. The House of Assembly adjourned business till after the funeral, and attended that ceremony officially. The Lieutenant-Governor had given his assent to several important bills. A donation given hy Mr. Henry Labouchere, Her hiajesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies, had diffused great satisfaction. The island was rather unhealthy, which is generally the case at thlis season of the year; fever was prevalent. From De Cordlova's lercantile Intelligcewer we learn that the sales of sugar averaged 22s. to 25s. per 1001b. In pimento sales had been effected at 21d. to 3d. per lb. The stock of corn was large * a cargo of 1,500 bags from Savanilla sold at 3s. per bushel. All descriptions of butter were very dull of sale. Exchanges on London were quoted, for Jamaica and Colonial banks, 90 days' sight, A per cent. pm.; 60 days', 1 per cent. pm. ; 30 days, 11 per cent. pm. Private bills at par. At Demerara a short session of the Colonial Legislature had been held, convened for the special purpose of considering whether the resolutions of the Combined Court of 1855 and 1856 miight not be altered so as to require the payment of t~he bounty money in cash at the time of the indenture of the Coolie, and also whether the colony would be prepared to provide for the payment of the expenses to be incurred in India for continued immigration after the season 1856 and 1857. A string of resolutions submitted by the Attorney-General to carry out these views were agreedto. Aproposition having been made by some Liverpool capitalists to establish monthly steam communication between the colony of Demerara and Great Britain by way of M;adeira, the Legislature, at its special session, passed the following resolution:- "1 That this Court will favourably coinsider any scheme for establishing steam communication, with vessels of not less than 1,000 tons, between this colony and any part of Great Britain, vrid ?adeira, the Western Islands, and Bar. badoes, with the view of promoting immigration to this colony from those places * and that his Excellency be requested to make known the same by advertisement in some of the leading newspapers in Great Britain." The Royal Gazxtte (Georgetown, Demerara), of the 9th tilt., says:- "The weather during the past fortnight las been very wet, but on the whole favourable for the growing canes, though it has seriously impeded the manufacturing operations, as it was impossible to dry the megass. The exports during the fortnight amoiunted to-Sugar, 3,855 hogsheads, 765 tierces, 687 tierces, 1,287 barrels. 425 bags; rum, 151 puncheons. 3Sa hogsheads, 165 barrels; *molasses, 711 puncheons, 162 hogsheads, 62 barrels; rice, 4,092 bags; beef, 130 barrels, 60 half-barrels;* cocuai nuts, 1,311; cod flsb, 70 casks; and lard, 5 cases. Trade among the merchants is brisk, and freights are looking up."2 The Barbadoes House of Assembly continued engaged at latest dates with the bill for the incorporation of the city of Bridgetown; upwards of thirty clauses were got throiLuh in committee at the last meeting, but it was considered doubtful whether the bill would pass. His Excellency Sir Josias Cloete, Commander of the Forces, and staff, returned from Demerara on the 6th. A clhange of weather had taken place. It rained steadily the greater part of Sumiday, the 'th, and there had been several showers almost daily afterwards up till the packet's departure. The canes had very much iniproved, but the crop was expected to be a short one. Files of the St. Luwia PGlotliltm to the 6th of Dece,nmber have been received, but they contain nothing of interest. The plainters were preparing, for commencing crop, while the many fine showers wliich had lately fallen had served to bring forward the newly-planted canes, and to encourage agriculturists in augmenting the cultivation for 1858. From St. Kitt's there is no news, besides a warm encoiuniter between the two local papers. Bishop Davis was on a tour through Iiis diocess. At St. Vincent's the House of Assembly continued at wvar with the Lieutessant-Governor upon the subject of the circumistances connected with the conduct of MIr. Crosby, the recently suspenided police mnagistrate. The West Tndia Islands generally were much healthier than usual, with the exception of Martiniique, which was still suffering from the effect of yellow fever, although better than by last mail.

Advices from Martinique bring intelligence of a beginning having been given to the Franco-Asuerican line of TransAtlantic Steatmjers. B,tli the Franqois-Arago and the Aluma had made their appearance in those se.s. Ttse FrancoisArago left Havre on the 30th of September, was at Cadiz froum the 'thu to the 12th of October, and arrived at Martinique on the 2d Nov., between 9 and 10 a.m. ; thus taking 10 days to Ciadiz, and 22 days from ihat port to Martinique; in all, 32 days.

MILITARY AND NAVAL INTBLLIGBiqCE. The 52d Light Infantry depot at the provisional battalion, Chatham, has received such a large number of volunteers from other corps that the regiment, the service companies of which are stationed in India, is increased to its required establishment; and the recruiting parties have been directed to join their depot at Chatham. The depot of the 26th Cameronians at Chatham has also received a considerable number of volunteers from other corps, including several men from the 14th Foot. Lieutenant his Serene Highness the Prince of Leiningen is appointed to Her Majesty's yacht Victoria and Albert. Her Majesty's steam sloop Hermes, 6, Commander Gordon, arrived off Portsmouth in the night of Saturday, and went up to Spithead yesterday. She goes to the Cape of Good Hope. The steam troopship Simoom, 18, Commander Cooke, will be ready for sea at Portsmouth by Sunday next. The steam troopship Mfegaera, 6, Commander Purvis, has shipped nearly all her crew, and has lower rigging over the mastheads. She is, it is said, to embark troops at Cork for conveyance to the Mauritius. The operations at the new heaving-up slip3 at Haslar, Gosport, where is established the berthing for the gun and mortar-boat flotiUa, were completed last week by taking up the gunboat Gnat. The process was perfect, and proved the simplicity and practicability of the principle in using one trunk line, and disposing of an indefinite number of vessels by lateral arrangement. The Goat was drawn up the main line 10 feet per minute, and upon the transverse at the rate of 15. When opposite the shed appropriated for her she was drawn into it by a screw of three inches diameter, running the whole length, and wheu in their berth was freed from the cradle by four small hydraulics; the cradle was run from under the vessel, and placed on the trank line to receive another. The Government purpose laying up 200 of these gun and mortar boats at Haslar. A tremendous gale from the south-west was experienced in the Channel on Friday night, and during its height the screw steam ship James Watt, 91, Captain T. V. Anson, and the steam frigate Shannon, 51, Captain William Peel lying inside Plymouth Breakwater, parted their chains, and were obliged to let go their best bowers. Both got up steam to ease their moorings. On Saturday morning the Confiance and Zephyr stearvessels went off from Devonport dockyard, and supplied them with anchors and hemp cables. They wiU leave the first fair wind, under canvas, for Lisbon.

I TO THB EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I know that you do not generaUy open your columns to literary discussion, but I hope that you will, notwithstanding, permit me to say a few words with reference to the review of Professor Aytoun's Botkuveli that appeared in your number of the 27th ult. Anything to which The Timaes lends the authority of its name acquires thereby such an overwhelming influence with the public that it seems to me important, when it advances views which experience does not confirm, that they should not pass uncontradicted. I do not pretend to judge of the positive or comparative merits of Firmilian, Beth lndl, Festus, Balder, A Life Drama, or MAaud - but I wish to be allowed to ask whether we are really to believe, with your reviewer, that no poetry can live which is not popular; that no metaphysical poetry can ever be or become popular; and that the work-s of Wordsworth, Shelley, and the greater part of those of Tennyson must therefore necessarily perish? I will not go back to the Oriental poetry for instances to the contrary, because, although there are Europeans who profess themselves able to admire those mysticaUy and essentially " unpopular" poems for which is claimed an antiquity higher than that of any other verse extant, vet the reviewer would probably set these down as eccentric individuals of diseased and unnatural taste, whose opinions go for nothing. The immortality of old Hesiod may be due to the " transcendent common place" of his style and manner; so him, too, I must pass over. But while the poems of Lucretius keep his fame fresh what right has any one to say thlat no speculative poetry can live ? The mere fact, indeed, of that most " unpopular" exotic, the Latin poetry, having come down to us at all should at once dispose of the whole theory. To speak of later times, I deny that Dante was ever a popular, while I assert that he was pre-eminently a metaphysical poet. Yet he lives. The sonnets of Petrarchi may be compared, for their subtle analysis of a feeling, to the works of a living poet, and they are in the fifth century of their existence still far from the waters of oblivion. I will go further yet, and maintain that thethree leading plays of the three European countries that have created a national drama are essentially metaphysical, and neither unpopular nor forgotten. I allude, of course, to the Prometheus Bound, Hamlet, and La Vida cs Sueno. I think it is but a narrow view to hold that poetry must be "popular," in the sense that your reviewer appears to give to the term, as though the more refined and delicate emiiotions were not true, nor worthy of a place in art. These feelings spread and descend, and the unpopular poem becomes popular in time, if it 'e true poetry -aU metaphysical though it be. Nay, such stealthy progress do metaphysical ideas make in the minds of men that it would be hazardons to say that the day will not come when the ideas of Wordsworth, Shelley, and Tennyson shall seem as commonplace, familar, and comprehensible to English minds as do now those of Hesiodaforesaid, who was, no doubt, ratber aa abs'.-u3- e author in his day. And if this be the case, the English metaphysical trio above mentioned may, nerhaps, have almost as good a chance of immortality as Professor Aytoun, even though he have written the remarkable passages quoted by your reviewer. We are far too apt to seek to limit the domain of poetry by arbitrary bounds. I, for my part, am oldfashioned enough to believe in poetical inspiration, reaching beyond all bounds. Who has this inspiration is a poet who has it not is none. L Jourdain may have talked prose without knowing it, but no man ever yet really wrote poetry without feeling by a sudden inflax of emotion which raised him above his ordinary self both in sentiment and in utterance that he was no longer a mere writer, but a bard, a singer, one whose tone and gesture arrest us at once, coam- oelling Us to listen to him let him speak of what he maylove, heroism, devotion, politics, metaphysics, spasms, bootjacks, or criticism, I am. Sir. vour mnst oi.mt mr-vnt A. 3. Paris, Jan. 2. -
WA," OF GOOD HorsF%vivss ix AxERIcA.-We have seldom initiated a more wholesome agitation than by a recent article on the average food of our countrymen, or rather their average cookery. The multiplicity of the letters drawn out bythat article showtliat wehaveprobeda tenderspot. We shal repeatthe operationfrom time to time, and hopethus to be instrumentalinworkingagreat and much needed reform. It would be provoking, if it were not amusing, to note how much ingenuity is shown in perverting what we said. Thus one lady writes bonstingly of her milk, butter, fresh vegetables, fresh eggs, fine fruits, pure water, and wonders how we can pretend that city people have equally good. Why, madam, we never thought of such a thin;. You in the conntry have incomparably the best matenals from which to prepare food-nobody ever doubted that; but it is the use you make of those materials that we criticized. Your table may be a model of good judgment and good cookery; we know those tbat are; but this is by no means the general case. On the contrary, we know some of the finest fruit sections in our country in which you will not be offered a particle of fruit with breakfast or dinner for at least nine months in each year; salt pork, poor bread, and a imuddy preparation that they call coffee are the staple of breakfast, and the same minus the coffee and pluts a lot of watery potatoes are the substance of most dinners. Should not this be reformed 2 It is far dearer, less nourishing, less palatable, less wholesome, than a more varied, digestible, and savoury fare. Our young ladies-there being no girls now, except Irish-are educated to play the piano somehow, tovwork sundry articles in embroidery or otherwise, which we could not safely name and would prefer not to judge, and to imaoine they know something of the ologies ; but theireducation for the manapement acnd oversight of a household is sadly neglected. It is rather hard that a young mechanic, with no fortune but his bands, having just married a wife, should be compelled the next month to hire an Irish gitl to cook his dinner; but that is often the case. Let a family in the country be visited by eickness, so as absolutely to need feminine help, and if there be not an Irish colony within eesy reach, they must suffer ; for the great mass of our farmers' daughters are too proud, too ignorant, or too indolent, to do housework, even for good pay. These be deplorable truths; it was not so in the days of our grandmothers, and it must be otherwise in the days of our children. We might proceed with commentson the misapprehensions and blunders of our indignantculinary correspondenha; but we will let their productions serve as critiques on each other. Once for aU, we repeat that the country people have far better materials for food thpa can be secured by fanilies in like cirwamstances in the cities-and some of them improve their advantages, but the great majority do not. They ought to live much better tbhn thy do, considering the resources they have from which to prepare their food. They ought to bathe far more the. they do, and have better ventihated apartments, especially sleeping-rooms. Thorc who are growing up to be farmer' and mechanics' wives ounht to thsnk more, study more, and practise more with reference to tleir prospective hwasehold duties, even though ther should have to omit their piano lessons and stay awxy fromr the dancing-school to that end. These be sober truths, and the best housewives know it. They may cavil at somne rather sweeping assertions in our first article on this subject, but the scope and drift of that article were right, and if our indignant correspondents don't realize it their huabands probably do. We may aggravate our original ofmene bT saying it, yet we will say, nevertheless, that the best housekeepers in t' country know that the average cookery all around them ..i hideous, and that, instead of scotdintg us, they approve most of our strictures. We apprehend that some of ourshrewish criticsconfomudabundance andvariety of food with generousliving. The s,_om migtake,-RCzo York- Trilun4,
THE FRAUDS ON THE CITY BANKS. On Saturday James Anderson and James Tonnd Saiard were again broutht before the Lord Mayor at the Mansion-house, upon remand, in castody of Scott and Hug. gett, the detective offlcers, charged with having comintted a series of forgeries upon bankers in the city for a considerable time past. Saward, it will be remembered, is the person who was alleged, by Agar the convict approver, in the case of the great bullion robbery on the South-Eastern Railway, to have assisted him in disposing of some of the gold. In addition to the Lord Mayor, Sir R. W. Carden, Mr. Alderman Rose, and Mr. Alderman Hale, Mr. Tealon was upon the bench. Mr. Mullens, solicitor to the Committee of Bankers for Protection from Forgeries and Frauds, conducted the prosecution. Mr. J. C. Mees, solicitor to the South-Eastern Railway Company, atterded to watch the proceedings. The prisoners were not represented by solicitors. Mr. Muilens.-Your Lordship will recollect that on Saturday last two witnesses were examined, in the presence only of the prisoner Anderson, with reference to two forged checks, presented at Messrs. Hankey's on the 16th of August -one for 60L and one for 100L I propose at present to make these two checks the basis of my charge against both prisoners; but, as from the very nature of things I intend to call the two convicts, Hardwicke and Atwell, it will be necessary, in order to enable me to corrob -rate anystatements they may make, to begin with the connexion of each of them with the prisoner Saward, and then proceed to their connexion with the prisoner Anderson, and that Will involve the examination and investigation into seven or eight forgeries which have been committed during the course of that connexion. In order, however, not to make too wide a field, I propose, as AtweU formed his acquaintance with the prisoner Saward about the beginning of last year, to confine my attention tothe number of forgeries which have been committed during the course of the past year. Saward.-My Lord, before we go on with this eme perhaps you wiU allow me at the proper time to have the depositions already taken read over to me, because I want a saght correction to be made in them. I don't care when it is done, so long as it is done. Mr. Goodman, the chief clerk, proceeded to read the deposition of Huggett, the officer. Saward.-The officer states there that I said " I am Jem Saward." Mr. Goodman.-The words which the o°ccer attributes to you are these :-" I suppose its no use my holding out any longer. I am Jem Saward." Hnggett.-That is correct. Saward.-You may be a very good officer, and may think that a very smart observation. It stands to reason that I Ehould never say, "I am Jem Saward.' No sensible man would ever do so. I should never make use of such an observation. I don't court notoriety. I am fully sensible of my degraded position. I declare that I never did use the words, "I am Jem Saward." It would appear, according to that statement, as if I meant to make myself a criminal hero. The LORD MiYOR.-We can only tak-e down the evidence as the officer gives it. Saward.-Then, my Lord, I hope I may be aUowed most emphaticaUy to deny that I did make use of those words. It is most material to the issue that I should say that I never did use those words. What I did say was this, "As yon take me as James Saward, I admit now that I am the party you name." The LORD MiAyoP.-The officer was on his oath. He understood it the other way, and of course he gave his evidence as he understood you. Mr. Goodman read the depositions of John Mitchenden and George Inglic, the two porters who were sent by Anderson to get two forged checks cashed. The LORD MAYOIL-The evidence of these two witnesses has only been given against Anderson at present. Do you wish it to be considerea as evidence against Saward also? MIx. Mullens.-I wish it to be considered as evidence against both of them. It is evidence against both. Saward.-I don't see how it is evideuce against me. It does not allude to me in any way whatever. The LORD MAYOR.-You can ask the witnesses any ques. tions you think propsr in the shape of cross-examination. Saward.-My Lord, I shall decline to ask the witnesses any questions. Henry Atwel was brought into the witness-box by the Governor of Newgate, and in answer to Mr. Mullens said,I am a prisoner in Newgate. I have been convicted of forgery, and have been sentenced to transportation for life. I know both prisoners. I knew Saward first. I became acquainted with him about 12 months back. It happened that about that time I had in my possession some blank checks and some paid checks on Messrs. Barclay and I Co., the bankers. Those checks and blanks were part of the proceeds of a burglary committed on the premises of a Mtr. Doe. I showed these documents to a person named Saunders, who lived in Old-street-road. In consequence of something that passed between him and me I went to his house a second time, and saw Saward, who was a ntroducedto me by him. I think there were two blank checks, and I think there were three that had been returned by the bankers after having been paid. When I caled at Saunders's house on the second occasion I showed them to Saward. .Mfr. Mullens.-Ten us what passed in reference to those checks. Witness.-I came out of Saunders's house with Saward, who wished to know where Mr. Doe's place was. I went w ith him and showed him the place, in Brick-lane, Spiralfields, upon which he said that it was not a very large fim, and that he did not expect to get much from it. I then left him, he promising to meet me in the course of a few days or a week. d .r aullens.-While you were in Saunders's house was anything said with respect to what was intended to be done, or thought of being done, with the checks? Witness.-Yes. Saward told me that he could get money with tbem. Mr. MluUens.-Did he say how? Witness.-He told me that it was tobe done by filling un the blanks, and that they were then to be sent to the bankers'. He said he had a person whom he called the " sender" that he would introduce to me, and that that person would send them to the bank and get them cashed when filled up. After we had been to look at Mr. Doe's place I left the written and blank checks in Saward's possession. About a week afterwards I saw him again, when the prisoner, Anderson, and two other persons were in his company. I met Anderson near Spitalfields Church on the day upon which two eaecks were presented at Messrs. Barclay and Company's. Saward, who was with another person upon that occasion, returnedto me the three filled up checks which bad been previously given him. He also returned me the two others upon 3fessr. Barclay, which were fiUed up. To the best of my belief, the two checks now shown me are those two. The checks were put in evidence. One was dated the 9th of January, 1856, for 461. 15s. td., purperting to be drawn by J. B. Doe, jun., upon Barclay and Company. The other was dated January10, 18.56, for 951. 17s. 6d., purporting also to be drawn by J. B. Doe. jun. Examination continued.-Saward, who took the checks from the cuff of his coat, showed them to me and compared them with the writing in the canceled checks, which were then torn up and thrown away. Saward, Anderson, and I then proceeded to Leman-street, where they showed me a private house in which Anderson had taken a room to use as a place from which the checks could be sent. Anderson went into the house, Saward and I remaining outside near at hand. It had been previorgsly armnged that I should watch the man who was sent to the bank to see whether the money was paid or not. Another man also went into the same house. He shortly afterwards came out and went to Messrs. Barclay and Co's., I foUowmg him. This was with respect to the smaller check, for 461.l5s. 6d. He was the bearer of that check. I saw him receive the money at the counter. That young man I folowed straight back to Leman-street, and I waited outside while he went into the house and paid the money. Anderson was waiting at a neighbouring house. To the best of my belief, the check w;as paid in three 101.- notes, and the remainder in gold and silver. After Anderson had received the money he and Saward and our other companions met on the same day, in the same street, and went towards the Eastern Counties Railway, where Anderson had to meet another young man, whom he employed to take the other check to the banker's. I went with Anderson into an eating-house opposite the station, Saward and the others waiting close by. While in the eating-house Anderson, who had met the young roan on the platform of the railway, came in, and told us that he had sent him to Barclay's with the other check, for 95/. 17s. Gd. I followed the young nan to the banking-house, and saw the money paid him over the counter. The check was paid partly in 10.- notes, and the rest in gold and silver, It was part of my I duty in these "-mtters of business" to see the young man Iback safe. Ir. Mtullens.-Now, on this oceasion did the young man who had received the money for the check come back straight with it? Witness.-No ; he was going over London-bridge, instead of going back to the Eastem Counti,s Railway. (Laughter.) Mr. Mullens.-What happened then? Witness.-I went up to him and touched him on the shoulder, and said, " You must be going the wrong way. Sir." (Laughter.) He replied no, that he was only going to his last employers to know if Anderson bad sent for his character. At this time Anderson was not known by that name, but by another, which I forget. He changed his name each time that a check was sent. I said to the yonng man when I tapped him on the shoulder, " There's a gentleman waiting at the railway; he *ent me after you; he is very particular in trying his servants before he engages them." I accompeniedthe young man back to tbe railway when we met Anderson, who went into a publichouse with him, I remaining outside. When Anderson came out of the pubichonse he and I atserwards met Saward. Anderson then gave the bank-notes that be had received from the young man to Saward. We then proceeded together to the szmeighbourhood of the Hackisey-road. r. Mlullens.-Was anything said about what was to be rlisxe wvith the notes?t .ifuess.-Saward said he .vould take them and sell .thor.r, 3Mx. Xilens.-Was anytbiZgcaid as to whom he would sell tJlm to? Wi,gass. -T beleve the man'a,nzps was Hall. Anderson, J, andiwo ether men waitte at a publichouse while SaSwln Aent .o Fell tbq x9tgs, .JSaqw-d tubeequentl 're- turned to us and brought back gold for the notes. The gold was then divided among us five. Mr. Mullens.-Was an thing said by Saward upon that occasion as to who Mr. Halt was ? Witncss.-He said he knew him welL Mr. Mullens.-Now, that transaction being ha pily acaccomplished, did Saward say anything to you about repeating one of a similar nature? Witnes-Yes. Saward said if ever anything came in mY way I was to let Mr. Saunders know of it. I said I would, and he toldnme that if any " buainess" turned up with him e wouldw rite to me. I gave him my address. I was then living in Cottage-lane, City-road, and was passing by the name of liawkes. I was living there with a young woman who passed as my wife. I was occasionally visited there by my aunt. Saward visited me there three times. On the first occasion of his cominghe said he hadsome '-business for me if would do as I had done before. I agreed to the proposition. On the day of his lastvisit to m house a check was presented at Messrs. Smith, Payne, and Co.'s. He showed me some cancelled checks upon that firm-xix or seven, I think, which were signed by somebody named Ash. He also showed me the check now produced for 911. or something uncommonly like it. He told me that he and some others had taken apartments, and that they were going to send the check to the banker's. One set of apartments was in Oakley-crescent, behind the house I lived at in the City-road. lHe shoved me more than one filled up check. Another set of apartments was towards the New River. He told me that the man who sent the other checks was to send this, and it was arranged that I was to watch the bearer of it to the banlk, as on the frevions occasions. I did not know how the blank checks were got, but he told me that he believed they came from a robbery. He left the cancelled checks in my possession. Anderson, Saward, myself, and two other persons whom I do not name, then went to a publichouse at the back of my house, where Anderson dressed up for the occasion. He put on a wig of differently coloured hair to his own. Sometimes he dressed in whiskers and sometimes not but he always wore a wig. Thus dressed up he went to the lodging in Oakley-crescent. Seward and I then went to a spot near the Sportsman, one corner of which is in Oakley-crescent. The Toung man who had been hired for this job was first sent to the Camden-station of the London and North-Western Railway to make inquiries respecting some luggage which was supposed to have arrived thero. Upon his return I followed him to Smith, Payne, and Co.'s banking-house, and saw him take the check to the country order side. He then took it to the counter, where it was stopped, and I went off as quickly as I could to the place of rendezvous. I told Sarard and Anderson, who were waiting there, what had happened. We then separated. The nine cancelled checks produced are those which were shown to me by Saward. At the time they were left in my possession the sbeet of engraved tublan checks, now produced, of the North-Western Bank of India was left with them. This sheet of checks remained in my possession in Cottage-lane, until I left there rather in a hurry, in consequence of somothing that happened afterwards. After that they remained in charge of the young woman who passed as my wife. On the mornig when these papers were given to me by Saward she was at home and saw him. She came into the room while they were lying on the table. My aunt was also at my house that day. Some time afterwards I became aware that another " matter of business" was " up." Saward told me that he had sent to the banker's at the corner of tho Haymarket (Ransome's) for a book, and got one. On a certain day I watched three young men take three separate checks to that banking-house, all of which were paid. There were five of us in that transaction-namely, Sa ward, Antderson, myself, and two others. The money was divided into six shares-that is, a share for each of the five, the sixth being alotted to Saward for the trouble he had taken in getting the book. On the occasion of negotiating Barelay's checks Saunders received an extra share of the money, as he had obtained them, and on one occasion I niyself received an extra portion when I had obtained a check. One of the checks upon Ransome's bank was sent from a house in the neighbourhood of Park-street, Camden-town, and with reference to that check a young man named Markham was taken into custody in mistake for Anderson. Mr. Mullens.-That yonmg man was unfortunately convicted. There is certainly a very great resemblance between him and Anderson. Of course, he has long since received a pardon. The LonD MAYOst-Wbat was the amount of the checks cashed on the last day to which you have referred. Mr. Mullens.-It amounted to 2001. and odd pounds. Examination continued.-Soon afterwards Ir bad some further conversation with Saward relative to a bill of exchange at Hankey's. Saward wrote me a noto the night previous, teUing me he wanted to see me. In consequence of what passed between us I went on the 18th of April last to a house in Cunmberland-street, Hackney-road. He then showed me the document to be presented. The bill now shown me is that document. Mlr. Mullens.-This is a billof exchange for 38GI. 17s.10d., drawn by W. F. Jennings and Co. on Samuel Dobree and Sons, three months' date, due 18th of April, 1856. Witness. -Anderson went dressed up that morning to a house in Cumberland-street, and I watched a young marl from there to Hankey's bank. That bill was not paid. I met Saward and Anderson at a coffeehouse near Shoreditch Church, and communicat,d to them that the bill had not been paid. I know Mr. Turner, a solicitor in Red Lionsquare. In April last I went to that gentleman for the purpose of employing him upon some pro'essional business. Before I went I bad seen Saward and Anderson upon the sabject. Saward told me that if he could get a check filled up by 1r. Tunmer he had got some blank checks on Gosling and Co.'s bank which cond then be filled up. Mr. Mullens.-What was done in order to get Mr. Turner's signature? Did you invent the scheme, or did Saward, or anybody else ? Witness.-Saward proposed that I should take an I 0 U for a supposed debt due to myself, in order that Mr. Turner might write for payment of it, and when he received the money the money might be left in his hands for a few days, so that he might pay it into his bankers, and that when I wenti for payment I should receive a check for the amount. The amount of the I 0 U was 301. odd pounds. I gave MCr. Turner instructions to suo a Mr. Hesp for the money, Mr. Hesp being made for the occasion. A place was hired in the name ot Hesp, in order that a letter written by .Ir. Turner might be taken in tbere. Some days afterwards I went to Mr. Turner's to know if my debtor had paid his debt. I advanced the money to pay the debt with, and my brother took it to 31r. Turner's. WVben I caDled I was informed that the money wras paid, but Mr. Turner's clerk unfortunately paid me in cash, instead of, as we had hoped he would, by a check. (Laughter.) I communicated the result to Saward, who said " W e must wait somo little time, aud then try it again." At the latter end of the month of May last I heard from Saward of a person named Hardvricke (another convict under sentence of transportation for life). Saward told me that he was going to meet a person in Fxrringdonmarket who had lately come from Australia, and who had some " business" for him (Saward) to do. Mr. MuIllens.-What did you understand by the word bhusines'sf' Witness.-Forgery. Saward, Anderson, Hardwicke, and myself all met in the market. I knew Anderson by the name of "Bob." Saward said that Hardwicke had been out of England for some years, but that he had known him previously to his going abroad. The subject of " business" was at once entered upon. Some documents were produced at the tine. -We afterwards met at a publichouse which we used to call the " beefhouse," in the Southwark-bridge-road. The landlord had nothing in the house to eat, and hsd to send out for some beef, which was the cause of our calling it the "beefhouse." Mlr. Mullens.-This is app%rently a trivial matter, but it wiU be very material hereafter. (To the witness.) Now, between that time and the time when the bill for 1,000?. was presented, which we wiU come to by and bye, did you four persons meet at this "'oeefhouse "s everal times? Witness-Yes. Mr. Mullen-s.For the purpose of discussing this matter of " business !'" Witness.-Yes. On one of those occasions Hardwicke produced a bill for 2001. Mr. Mullens.-This is a genuine hill, drawn by Crossman and Co., of Hobart Town, upon Stephen Kinnaird and Co., of Austinfriars, 93 days' sight, payable to the order of Charles Lee and Co., and by them endorsed to Hardwicke. It is a cepted by Rinnaird and Co., and payable at Messrs. Heywoodan y Witness.-Beside that bill Hardwicke produced several blank forms. Two first, two seconds, and two thirds, all in blank. He also produced some old biUs filled up. The bill now shown me is like one of them. Hardwicke gave them to Saward, who took them away with him. The bill for 1,000?. shown me I saw at a public-house in the Kingsland-road. Sawaradtoldmeothat a 1,0001' bill was prepared. I recollect one day beingwithAnderson and Hardwickeuinthe shop of M3r.Townend, the hatter, in the neighbourhood of Cheapside. The young man Clements, who is now pointed out to me, came in While we werethere. He asked some question and went out again, and Hardwicke followed him. I know from Anderson that he hired a house in the name of Riley. It was arranged that this bill should "come off" on a Saturday in June. We aU four met on thxt morning at Child's publichouse, in Old-street. road, Anderson dressed up as usual, and we went to a publichouse in Englefield-road, Kingsland, tho name of which I do not recollect. MX. Mullens.-I want you to be as accurate as possible in recollecting whether before you went to the house or afterwards Anderson went to the lodgingthathc had hired. Witness.-Wo all went to the publichouse first, and Anderson afterwards went to the lodging. Beforo he did so a 201.-note wasproducedby Hardwicke. Saward asked for a pen and ink, which were bro.ght in by a woman who, I believe, apologized for the room not being ready for the reception of visicors. A name and address were written upon the note by Swrard. It was then given to Anderson, who took it to the lodging to give it to thc young man to get it changed at the Bank of England. hcile the young man was gone the 1,000?. bill was produced and some date was put across it, but which of the dates I do not know. When the young man returned Anderson brought in two foreign bil stamps. Saward stuck a stamp on the back of one of the bills, and wrote an endorsement upon it, and it was then taken by Anderson back to the lodging, for the purpose of being given to the young man Clements. It was then arranged that we should meet in a publichouse in Bishopsgato.churchyard to Iearn the result of its presentment. Eardwicke, who left first, was to go to the banking-houso and wait till I came. I followed tho young man Clements. Saward was the last man to leave the publachouse. Clements rode on an omnibus and I rodo by the side of him. I saw him go into Heywool's bank. Hard. wicke also went in, and Saward was clorebl',in King Williamstreet. Shortly after Hardwlcke went tn he came out and made a signal to me, upon which I vent into tho baniingbouse, and saw that the money was being taken back by tho clerk from Clements, to whom he had previously handed it. 1 asked some trivial question, and went out and ommunicated to Saward what had happened. We aU l et l hortl afterwards at the publichouse in Bishopsgate-churchy ar where we had something to eat We afterwards went to the Shades. We were together about three hours. On Monday, the 16th of June, I went to Er. Turner again. We had in the rceantime diseweod the matter, and Ani-m wickeagreed toadvanoe amueokargerstm thaniiadbeenpre. viously advanced bhyme for thI muuvss of carYing out our fedIgn. I took to 3r. Turner an I0 Ufor upwarsof rloo. the jiame of the supposel debtor be1ngHart. igotthsl0 U from Saward. An arrngement w toen made respectin Ilodm at which letters in tho name of Hart vroulIde received. I gave Mr. Turnm r instructions to write for pay ment of the I 0 U. Some person whom Hzrdwicke employed paid the money as it was his money. A, few morings afterrwards Hardwicke, Saward, Anderson, mynyf an&t a fifth man met in Red Lion-squaro near Mr. Turner'e office. Mr. Mullens.-How came a fifth man to be in this I Witness.-He had found the checks. Mr. Mullens.-He had accidentally found them in Mlr, Turner's pocket? Witness.-I believe so. (Laughter.) MIr. MUllens.-Did yoa go into afr. Turner's office to get~ the money? Witness.-Yes; I received for answer that 3Mr. Tnrner vas out and I must call again. I went into the "uare and& told this to Saward and the others who were waiting there. At that moment a gentleman passed us, upon which Saward& said, " That's Mr. Turner," and I returned to Mr. Turner's. office. I then received a check for 103 8s. lod. on Messrs. Gosling's bank, and signea xreceipt for it. (Tho check and reoeipt were identified by the witness,) I signed. the receipt in the name of " W. Hunter." Mr. Mullens.-Why did you do that? Witness.-So that we should get the letters "h-u-nD" in case we afterwards wanted to imitate M1r. Turners. writing in the word "hundred." Saward.-If that is true or false it is an absurdity, because. be wonld hare had to repeat the "hundred " in the body of the check. ne Mr. Mullens.-The first application to Mr. rwas t wvrite for payment of an I 0 U for 30., the next for one, of 1031. odd. You are better educated in the law than I am, but I should recommend you for your own saketo hold your tongue. Mr. Mullens tben said he had not neaLrly concluded the evidence of this witness, and asked for a furtherreman& of the prisoners. Saward.-My Lord, some things have been taken'fror me which I wish returned. The LORD MAYLr.-What aro they? Saward.-5s. or 6s., and some papers. Huggett.-Two blank checks and a memorandum-bo6k. Saward.-And a knife. The LORD X%LtIor.-You mav have the money. It is against the rules of the prison that you should be aowved a kmife. The blank checks and the memorandum-book musb be kept possession of by the officer. Mfr. Rullens said that up to this time he had at least 30 witnesses to examine for the prosecution. Theprisoners were then remanded till Wednesdav nePt
RAILWTAY OMNIBUS-vS. TO THE EDITOR OF TIHE TiIIES. Sir,-Not very long ago your columns contained an excel. lent article on the subject of laying down rails through tho great throughfares of London for the purposo of establishing a regular traffic of large omnibuses to be drawn by horses and thus producing the double good effect of clearing tho large arteries for trado and of expediting the conveyance of passengers. Whether this ingenious plan would ultimately answer in the great thorou2hfares or not I do not mean to discuss, but there cannot be the slightest doubt on the mind of any one who has witnessed the wonderful success of the railway omnibuses from Paris to Pas&y, that it is admirably asdapted for localities such as from Hyde Park-corner to Kensington, or from the M%rble Arch to Bayswater. The Passy omnibuses start from the Place de la Concorde for Passy (and vicc vcrsa) every half-hour. As there is onlr one line of rails laid down along the public road (and sunk into it so as to allow of other carriages driving over it), it is so arranged that tho omnibus each way does not start until its consort has arrived. They start once or twice to take up and set down passengers, and at theso stopping places double lines are laid down for a few yards so as to admit of two carriages passing each other if it should be at any time necessary, but these precautions seem superfluous, as the carriage itself can be drawn for a short distance on the ordinary road should it be requisite. The rail omnibuses are extremely large, comfortable, and roomy, having the appearance of tvo or three railway carriages joined together. Each contains (inside and outside) 61 passengers, they are always full, and in fine weather overflowing, their great advantage being that the motion is as easy as that of a first-class raUviay carriage, sand that, although only drawn by one pair of stout horses, they perform in less than 10 minutes a distance which in a casmnon road omnibus requires a long half-hour of fatiguing jolting. The establishment of such a mode of conmmunication would be the greatest boon to the inhlabitants of Kensington, Bayswater, and many other places similarly situated; would tend more than any other plan to free the roads from an inconvenient amount of traffic; would facilitate beyond measure the intercourse with the immediate neighbourhood Of the metropolis, and without a dcenbt contribute considerable profits to any company having the energy to carry out the plan in a. proper manner. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant. AN ANGLO-PA RISIAN. Paris, Jan. 2.
ADMIRALTY CHARTS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In repiy to the letter of Mr. P. Edward Dove, which appears in your paper of Thursday, the 1st, in which he very properly calls attention to the incorrectness of the charts in general use by the steamvessels navigating the Irish Channel between Liverpool and Glasgow, and where he specially allodes to thc very grave and fatal error of placing Corsewell Ligtthouse on thc rrong side of Corsewell Point, tbc blame rests entirely withthe. owners or captains of thoso vessels continuing to use non-official charts instead of providing themselves with correct Admiralty In the official Admiralty chart of the Irish Channel, issued on a large scale, and sold at 2s., this light, and all tho soundings and dangers to be avoided, are correctly laid down. I quite coincide with Mr. Dove that it is " monstrous that charts, and recent charts, should be sold to ships vrith such a glaring error staring them in the face." Nsy, it is absolutely criminal that ships sbould s6il wIth, as he correctly terms them, " such abominable charts," imperilling the lives of crew and passengers, and endangering much property, in consequerce ot uncorrected and faulty charts issued by private persons. It certainly becomes insurers, shippers, captains, and owners-nay, all concerned in maritime traffic, to see that ships are properly found in the requisites of navigation; and what is rrore vitally important than a reliable chart? The incorroctness of names may not be so very grave a fault; but accurate soundings and tho correct position of lights are essential for tho safe navigation of the When any of the Admiralty charts on a large scale, with all the soundings correct, are to be had at every principal port for a mere trille it becomes incumbent oni captains to see what they buy, and whether tho charts bear the Admiralty stamp, and are issued from the Hydrographic-offloe. I am compelled to state that I have frequently found cantais and owners so exocedingly niggardly as to grudge the outlay of a few shillings for special charts, contenting themselves with any general chart to be had, and thus for a paltry sum give themselves great trouble, and risk- the loss of their ships. Owners perhaps console themselves with the rellection that their ships are insured; but who insures the lives of those on board, and who will make provision for the families and relatives of those who may bo lost by this wanton disregard of common prudence t If the owrners would but undertakctoesupply their ships with Admirachartsanddiroetions, as most of the pbhc companies do, instead of leaving captains to find their own, w e shouldhear much less of casalties,axnd the frightful list of annual wsrecks and attendant losses of lifec and property would be ~rotlv dimi. iuanca1.

FRmN'cI Piczur, OF OLI PAIuS.-An architoctnral critic in one of the daily papers has recently bocn pleased to express his disapprobation of the l.to improvements here, and his regret that old Paris should havo disappeared. Those who are capable of forming an idea of what the city realy was, and not as it has been described in popular romances, are far from sharing this disapprobation and regret. One of the most learned in the arch:eology and history of Paris, and, at the ame time, ono of the most agrceeable and spiritucl writers of the French press (ML Edouard Thierry), thus describes the city as it was 200 years ago, and which we are told to regret :-* Reconstruct in imagination that sombre Paris of the 17th contury, into which light has at last penetrated during onr time; those narrow streets, sheltering thieves; those walls, decayed by the damp arising from the streets; those filthy gutters, recking with warm and sickening streams from the neighbouring furrier or dyer; those shops of doubtful character, for the most part ungla7ed- those obscure houses, the doors of which were carefully hidden from observation; those angular staircases with massive wooden balustrades, but dimly lighted with bleared windows; those halting stairs, those uneven landings, thos chilly rooms, borrowing from tho outside a vitiated atmosphero and an uncertain light. Cross ansd recross this labyr;nth of streets, with the Seine hidden behind the bouses, which also encumber tho bridges. On alt sides imagine darkness, obstacles, nd embarrassmonts. From tho vindows wbshing-poles thrsiI out, or hoops, with rags hung thereon- mean shops plante at Sill; tubs inhabited by sellers, wvho open a huge red umbrella over their goods. Suppress the incemsant labour q tho last two centuries, the care and forethought of tho authorities, the order which surrounds us, the lantern lit up at night; ring oat the curfew, which wi warn the wayfarer that now be must rcly alone upon himself or his follow. ers, if he has any, for defence; let loose at night the beggars, by day the one-armed and lame, who, then appear as thieves and murderers- let looso lackeys ill-paid, young men of good family wvvo have been srpending their evenings in dissipation, hirod assassins, hidden, waiting for their victim gamblers turned out of the hells, and who hunger after the purses of others; givo back to the gibbets their dead, to the churches their graveyards_-an you will then kave reconstructed Paris bizarre and ginister-Paris of the middle ago." It must bc oonfesed that the picture of M1. Thierry differs much from those the publio have been accustomed to, but then it is faithful_-as exact as a daguerreotype and the readerwhen ehas called upthisscene to hisn nds eye, will probably be content to forego the romance and mystery of the middle age for the personal security, clanlinesu and comfort of our much-*uab d 19th QCntur.-2it4sin, ,Yc
