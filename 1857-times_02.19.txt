B. F SMTH, itrwanHouse, Chelsea. TO TEHE EDITOR Or' TEHE SUNDAY TrF tiES
Sir,-I observe in youtr first editioni a letter from Mir. Smith. notify. ing his resignation of his seat in the direction of the Metropolitan Saloon Omniibus Company. As oni the same groundsa I also have found it necessary to withdraw imy name from the direction of which I was esairman, I should fe,-l obliged by your giving place in your oolumns for the touowing explatatton of iny reasons for so doing.
At the oommencement of the undertakin3g I was solicited by the pro. mroters to take the chair and chief direction of the Company's aff4air, and believing, from my long experience in omnibus conveyance, that I could be of material ansaistance to the Company and service to the public by joining the undertaking I did so, and have from that time exerted mysetf as much an possible to bring into use the saloon omnibus, which I believe possesses qualidratlone which would be appre. ciated. I have found, however, that insuperable difficulties have arisen : the shares have not been taken up, an expensive paper war. fare haa been entered into, and that, after several months spent in en. deavours to raise the capital necessary for the undertaking, the funids ane exhausted and the public confidence apparently leen.
At this juncture I opened a communication with the London General Omnibus Company, in the hope that they, behug an established Corn. rany, ankd manifeating a willingness to give the publio the advantage of an Isaproved conveyance, would give a trial to our saloon omnibus. I was met by them in a fair spirit, and a deputation from the two Boards met, with a view to an arrangement of the kind, whicha resulted in an offer of the London General Omnibus Company to purchas the interet of our Company for about £1,100, whereby our shareholders mnight be re-imbursed. and theomnibuecAworked for the public benefit, and a ruinous competition with a powerful organised comDany pre. vented. Other of the Directors of the Saloon Company have, however, chosen to=big in aoother solicitor to their Company, who, proposing to miclmoe capital, will, I fear, Involve the Company onfurther difficulties. Under theseclrcreastances, feeling that the public requirements would be fully served tb' the London General mer,ibus Coin. puny working the Saloon Omnibus, and that the mintrests of oar chars. holders would be best served by the offer of the London General Omnil. his Copn eng acceded -to. I have felt bound to retire from the Bard,-wth whosea proceedig I can no longer concur, and to lake this co"'se of mkn known toth shareholders, to whom I am account.

THE IRISE JUDGES.
Mr. NAPIER asked the Attorney-General for Ireland whether any arrangement had been made to secure the attendance of a judge at chambers in Dublin during the circuit which was now fixed to go out at tho end of this month ?
Mr. J. D. FITZGERALD said no official representations had been made to the Government upon the subject. He was aware that it was a matter of considerable discussion among members of the bench and the bar, but no arrangement had been made to remedy what might be the cause of considerable inconvenience. The remedy, however, lay with the judges themselves, who could have no difficulty in arranging that, for example, those on the North-Western Circuit should leave early, so as to return to Dublin within two or .ree days of the time, when it was necessary the chief judges should quit that city.
JUDGMENTS EXECUTION, &c., BILL.
Mr. CRAUPURD moved that the Speaker leave the chair, in order that the House might go into committee on this bilL
MIr. HUGHES said the effect of this measure would be that a'creditor having obtained an English judgment might, just before the expiration of the six years, send a mnemoran. dum to Ireland -and have a right of execution during another six years in that country, although he could have no such remedy in the county where he had recovered. He objected to such a violation of equitable rules, and moved that the House would on that day six months reealve itself into the said committee.
Colonel FRENCH seconded the amendment. Mr. HADFIELD supported the bill.
Mr. WEHITESIDE said, it was important to consider whether the remedy would not introduce greater mischiefs than the small evil which it professed to cure. The instances in which the alleged grievance arose were very rare indeed, and by an act which he had the honour of introducing a judgment creditor in an English or Scotch court could serve notice of action upon the defendant in Ireland, who might thereupon settle at a cost of not more than 30s., but, against whom, if payment were not made, final judgment could be obtained in 12 days. Was the hon. and learned member (Mtr. Craufurd) in a condition to state the expense of sending over the judgment ? It perhaps cost 3s. Gd., and not more. That was the evil to be remedied. In 20 years' experience he remembered but five instances. The assumption upon which the hon. and learned member proceeded was that the law was the same with reference to the judgments of the three countries, and that it vas necessary to apply an equal rnle of legislation to the three kingdoms. But that was not the fact. The country was promised a Minister of Justice, and as soon as he was appointed he (Mr. Whiteside) should be at him to do his duty and amend and revise the law of judgments in Ireland. (Hear.) The law of judgmuents had been investigated by a commitwe a few months ago, and they stated in their report that the law of judgments in Ireland required to be reconsidered, but that recommendation had never been complied with. The expense of working the present biU would far exceed the expense of serving a process and giving notice of the judgment. Ho would suppose a merchant in Manchester or Belfast to say to a trader in Ireland or England, "You want goods. You are a little 'shaky,' and I want to get a preference. Come, give me a judgment. I wiU not use it against you or enter it until it is necessary
When the time came, and the merchant wanted to oust the debtor, he had only to send the little memorial of the judgment across the channel. He could then get judgment in half an hour, and could sell up the debtor before the other creditors could interfere. How did that enforce the hon. and learned gentleman's theory of fraudulent preference ? He would recommend the hon. and learned gentleman either to postpone his biU until the new department of justice was established, or to refer it to the Attorney-General for Ireland, who was bound to bring in a biU to remedy the law of judgments in Ireland in conformity with the reoom. mendation of the select committee. (Hear.)
Mr. L BLAND denied that the bill was an assimilation of the law of the three countries ; it was rather a measure for altering it. It was right that persons should pay their debts, but the House must take care lest by this bill persons were made to pay money that they never owed, and lest one set of creditors obtained a fraudulent preference at the expense of another. (Hear, hear.) He regarded the bill as the first step towards centralization, since its effect would be to draw all the law business into this great city. Hie should support the amendment.
Colonel DUNNE had opposed this bill with the fuU approbation of the mercantile classes among his constituents. The law officers of Ireland used to oppose the biUl. Mr. Justice heogh was always against the measure, and the uresent Attorney-General for Ireland formnerly opposed it.
zenow supported it, although there was no difference whatever between the present bill and that which the right hon. and learned gentleman opposed.
MIr. M'CANN could affirm that the traders of Ireland were opposed to this bill. (Hear, hear.) There were no complaints from them of the working of the present law, nor were there any petitions from the people of England in favour of the biL
Sir J. FITZGERALD should feel bound to support the amendment.
Mr. M'MAHON said he opposed the bill on English grounds. If hon. members would look to TVie TTime money articlewf Thursday last they would find a letter the writer of which caUed attention to the great danger of judgments being obtained in Scotland against English debtors behind their backs. The writer showed that unless provisions were framed against'giving decreets, or iudgments 1n absence, the same force in England as those obtained in Scotland after defences were heard parties might be unex. pectedly caled upon to pay debts sued in Scotland which they never contracted, or for which they were not liable. The fact was that the system of jurisprudence in Scotland was in many respects in a barbarous and primitive state, and required amendment. He opposed the measure on behalf of the iEnglish traders.
Mr. WARREN thought it his duty to go into committee on the bill. (Hear.) If he thought that this bill would work injustice upon the traders in Ireland he would never support it, but he regarded it as a measure to secure the uniform administration of the law throughout the united kingdom. A judgment was simply the deliberate declaration of the Court that the plaintiff ought to recover a certain sum of money due to him by the defendant. That declaration could not be made behind the back of the defeudant. The object of the biUl was with industrious care to put a judgment of the Courts of the three kingdoms on the same footing. It was his belief that if the biUl passed it would have a directly salutary effect, since it would deter people from incurring debts which at present they might think they could get off paying by evading a court of competent jurisdiction.
Mr. NAPIER said that the hon. and learned member (Mr. Ciaufurd) introduced a bill on this subject in 154. It was referred to a select committee, the members of which were all desirous to give effect to the principle of the bill, so far as it gave a cheap and quick rernedy for the recovery of just debts. The committee laboured for weeks, and agreed to clauses which were omitted from the present bill, and which were intended to prevent the abuses that might arise from the Scotch judgments. His objection was that the remedy was worse than the disease.
and he protested against going into a scrambling com-
mittee of the whole House to consider this bill. BY the first clause a judgment 15 or 20 years old which could not be enforced in the kingdom in which it was obtained might be transferred by memorial to another kingdom, and execution issued upon it without any notice to the
person affected by it. Again, if a person issued execution or more than the amount due to him, if he " overmarked" it, hewas now hable to an action, but by this bill if a man - overmarked" an execution in Ireland, obtained by means of an English or Scotch judgment, the person against whom it was isuedl would have no remnedy unless he took proceedings in England or Scotland. (Hear.) That difriculty had been felt by the select committee, and they had therefore confined the operation of the bill to ud gefts obtained in adverse suits. The subject-was of dnif ties, and it ought to be dealt with by the Governmecnt. (Har.) He suggested that -wherever there had been an adjudication upon a demaand, and the debtor was niot re-sident in the kingdom -were suclh ad(udication had been obtained, a specified coy of the adjuhn ation should be sent to the counLtry in wIch the debtor resided, and an affidavit made of the amount due, uponwhich ajndge should, if he thousht proper, make an order, and that order by a recent r'aw would become a rule of court. (Rear, hear.) He certainly did not think thAt the present hill would effect any improve. mdent in the law. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. ROEBUCK sad there was no doubt that all laws in a civilzed country similar to each other ought to have the same effect in every part of that country, but the bill Wua not founded siren that principle; on the contrary, it gave the same effect to different laws. (Hear, hear.) The statemnent of the hon. and learned member for WexfordI (Mr. 21f'ahion) 'was quite correct as to the nieans by-which a judgment might be obtained in Scotland against an
Englshman residing in London, but possessing heritable
.roperty in Seotlad. The law of Scotland was that the court of Sesion was the communc forumt of all persons residing abroad, and they were summoned to it by citation at the Market-cross of Edinburgh, and at the pier and shore of Leith ("hear, hear," and a laugh), probably because it was supposed that the sound could cross the water and reach the ears of a man living, perhaps, in the roar of London. (Hear, hear.) When a man who resided abroad possessed only moveable property in Scotland the process of " arrestmont" was resorted to *a letter was directed to the supposed debtor and put into a bos; he heard nothing of it, a,ud if this bill became law the first notice he would have of the proceedings would bo that some one would issue execution against him in London. To that execution he would have no answer. The hon. and learned gentleman who had brought in the bill had begun at the wrong end. Instead of dealing with this peddling process, he uught to have begun by assimilating the laws and giving equal effect to them in al parts of the kingdom. (Hear, hear.)
The LORD-ADVOCATE recollected the introduction of the first of these bills. It was founded upon the principle tbat a judgment pronounced in one kingdom should have effect given to it in the othor two kingdoms, and the committee of 1854 were quite clear in their opinion that the principle was a good ono. But the bill also contained provisions relating to the service of process, and the committee were egually clear that process ought not to he served oat of the jurisdiction of the court from which it was issued. The bIl was reintroduced after the report of the committee, vith amendments, but only passed through this House. In the following year the bil was again introduced, but it contained clauses allowing the process of the Court of Chancery to be served out of the jurisdiction of that court, and his hon. and learned friend the Attorney-General objected to it on accounit of those clauses. The bil was reintroduced last year without the objectionable clauses, but it could not be carried for want of timne. The present bill merely carried into effect the principle unanimously recognized by the committee of 1854. He agreed with the hon. and learned gentleman who had just sat down that it would be desirable to assimilate the laws of the three kingdoms, but there were great di3ficulties in the way of that result, as all nations adhered as long as possible to their own laws, whether those laws were good in the abstract or not: and sometimes the jurisprudence of the smaller nation was better than that of the larger nation into which it was sought to be moulded. Effect was given to a foreign judgment in every civilized country, and he thought the time had now come to make a judgment obtained in one of these three kingdoms available in the other two. Even without this bill eflect was given m English courts to judgments pronounced in Scotland, if the courts in Scotland had proceeded regularly, and had jurisdiction. The only question was whether they ought to continue to treat the three kingdoms as foreign kingdoms? (Hear, hear.) He thought they ought not. The fact that actions were not very often brought upon Englishjudgments in Irish courts proved that a measuro of this kind was r.cessary, as creditors preferred losing their debts to brin.- ing two or three separate actions for them. (Hear.) e believed the hon. and learned gentleman opposite (Mr. M'Mahon) would alter his opinion of the jurisprudence of Scotland when he had studied it more deeply,but some of the questions which had beon raised with regard to Scotch process might very well be considered at a fature stage of the bill. He therefore hoped the House would all,y it to go
Mr. SPOONER objected to the bill on the ground that it would open the door to fraud, by enabling dormant judgments to be put in force without notice.
Mr. G. BUTT had heard no valid argument against the principle of the bill, and thought it would prevent instead of giving rise to fraud. If the objection taken by his right hon. and learned friend (Mr. Napier) as to " overmarking" executions were not met by the third section as it now stood words might easily be introduced for the purpose.
The House divided, when the numbers were-
For going into committee ... ... ... 127 Against it ... ... ... ... ... so
Majority ... ... ... ... 47 The House accordingly resolved into committee.
The first clause was read, providing that where judgment has been obtained in the courts at Westminster a memorial thereof registered in Ireland, and zice vcrsd, shall have the effect of a judgment of the court in which it is so registered.
Mr. M'MAHON observed that the bill proposed that a judgment of the Sheriffs' Courts of Scotland, when registered, should bave the effect of the judgment of the courts in England and Ireland ; and he thought that the judgments of other courts should be put on a par with the judgments of the Sheriffs' Courts. He therefore moved to insert in the first clause the words, " the Courts of Common Pleas of Lancaster and Durham, the Mayor's Court of London, tho County Courts, and all other Courts of Record."
Mr. G. BUTT did not suppose that the amendment was seriously proposed. The object of the bill was confined to the judgments of the superior courts of justice, and was not intended to apply to the judgments of the smaller courts with limited jurisdiction. Nevertheless, he thought there would be no objection to include the Common Pleas of Lancaster and Durham in the bilL
Mr. CRAUFURD said that the County Courts had been strack out of a former bill by the select committee which considered it. He had no objection to the insertion of the Common Pleas of Lancaster and Durham.
MIr. H. HUGHES suggested that the present committeo should he adjourned for a week, in order that hon. memb,ers havinzg amendments should place them on the printed
pper, and thus make the House acquainted with them| efore their consideration. Several amendments of the measure had been suggested to him by one of the Irish jiudges.
Mr. J. FITZGERALD thought the suggestion of the hon. and learned member for Longford entitled to consideration, and should be ready to agree to any amendments calculated to prevent any inconveniences arising from the measure.
Mr. CRAUFURD acceded to the suggestion for the postponement of the committee, observing that his only wish was that the bill might be made as perfect as possible; and that the fullest consideration should be given to every amendment.
After a brief discussion the House resumed, the committee having been postponed till another day.

PUBLIC HEALTH SUPPLEMENTAL BILL (1857). This bill was read a second time.
NEW WRIT.
On the motion of Mr. J. D. F}TZGERA11) a new writ was ordered to issue for the election of a member for the county of Tipperary, in the room of Mr. Jiames Sadleir, who has beea expelled the House.
EDUCATION.
Sir J. PAEINGTON then rose to move for leave to bring in a bill to promote education in citios and towns. He said,-I rise once more to request the permission of the House to introduce a bill to give increased facilities for the extension of popular education. It is not my intention to trespass upon the time of the House at any considerable length, and I am the less disposed to do so because I am sorry to observe that, in consequence of the unexpected termination of the discussion of the bill which has occupied a good deal of attention this morning. many of those gentlemen who I know were anxious to take a part in the discussion of my motion, if discussion there shall be, or who, at all events, would have taken great interest in the subject, have left the house. The first expla. nation which I desire to offer to the House is, that this bill has been so drawvn as not to contravene or reverse the deci. sions'at which this House arrivedlast year upon theresolutions moved by the noble lord the member for the city of London. I wiU not now advert, for I have done so on previous cca. sions, to the rather peculiar circumstances under which the House divided upon these resolutions. AU that I now wish to say is this, that putting a Parliamentary construction upon the negativing of them by a large majority, the decision of last year amounted to this, that the House disapproved the plan of the noble lord considered as a whole. That plan was compulsory and general. I have therefore drawn the bill which I seek to int;roduce in such a manner as to make it, in two most important respeots, the exact reverse of the plan of the noble ord. I propose a permissive instead of a compulsory, and a local instead of a general system of education. I am aware of the objections to permissive legislation upon important subjects. I entirely agree with the noble lord the member for the city of London in thinking that a compulsory aud
general system of education would be far more satisfactory and beneficial than that which I propose (hear, hear); but when I find that great doubts are entertained by many people whose opinions are entitled to great respect, as to the success of a compulsory system, I think I have taken a part at once more prudent and more respetful to the
cisions of the ouse in proposing a permissive rather than a compulsory plan. Entertainingthis opinion, I may naturally be allowed to inquire what precedents we have with respect to permissive legislation, and whether they are encouraging or otherwise. There aretwo very interesting and recent precedents of that description. There is the act which was passed by the hon. member for Duumfries to permit corporate towns to levy rates for the establishment of libraries. We find by a paper recently laid on the table that that bill has been taken advantage of in five or six remarkable cases. I think the House wiU admit that to appeal to the ratepayers of a town to establish a library for the benefit of those who are already educated is not to appeal to their interests or sense of duty to anything like the extent of an appeal to them on behalf of those who have never received any education whatever. I shaU be very well satisfied if the bill which I propose shall be as successful as the Libraries Act of my hon. friend. The next precedent to which I shall refer is stiU more germane to this subject. I mean the act which was passed some 16 or 17 years ago, making it permissive to English counties to adopt an improved system of police. That act was a direct appeal to the ratepayers of.counties to consent to tax themselves for an object of very great public1 importance. And what was the result? Half of the I counties in England adopted that act. I. think that both of the instances of permissive legislation to which I have referred are very encouraging. I propose that the biU shall be local and not general in its operation, and that it shall be applied only to cities and corporate towns. Ihave selected them because the boundaries of theirjurisdiction are clearly defined. There will, therefore, beno occasion to introduce any new machinery for the purpose of defining ae limits of the operation of this bill. I believe that there are many persons who entertain alarm respecting the operation of an educational bill of a compuslsory and gieneral character, but who are very desirous of trying a permissive plan inl such cities and corporate towns as may choose to adopt it. I do not pretend to say that the necessity for the plan which I propose is not as great in rural districts as in corPorate
twns. (Hear.) I believe that our system of nationsl eda-
cation is as defective in the rral districts as in towng'. but we must bear in mind that it is in the latter that a want of education works most evil. The statements whichIhave made to the House on previous occasions as to the necessity for an improvement in our system of national education have never yet been disproved, although in some instances they have been contradicted; and they cannot be disproved, because they rest on the sure foundation of truth. For the purpose of showing the importance of introdacing such a measure as this into towns I may mention some statisics with regard to one of the most iraportant towns in the empire-namely, Manchester. I am glad to see my right hon. friend the member for Manchester in his place. I am sure he will not dispute the accuracy of mv statement. I find that the Rev. Dr. 'lKerrow stated, in his examination before the committee upon the Manchester and Salford Education Bill, that there were 30,100 children in Manchesterwho were neither at school nor at work. (Hear.) I had an opportunity of conversing with him on the subjec' about a week ago, and he informed me that the state of things has become rather worse since that evidence was given. I have before me a memorandum of a report which was given to me a few days ago by a clergyman who is much esteemed by all those who know hinm for the exemplary manner in which he discharges his spiritual duties in the great town of Manchester-I mean Canon Richson, the Rector of the arish of St. Andrews. That parish is only of the extent of 97 acres, uron which there is a population of 13,000. Canon Richson s report states that, of the population between 3 and 16 years of age, 431 per cent. attend Sunday schools, 25 per cent. are at work, 29 per cent. attend dayschools, and 46 per cent. are neither at school nor at work; the result being, as he assures me, that not less than 1,200 children in that single parish attend no school whatever. I appeal in the most temperate manner to every gentleman in this house, even to my strongest. opponent on this subject, to say whether such a state of things ought not to be remedied ? I do not undervalue the present system. I acknowledge the benefits that it has conferred, but I ask whether there is anything in it which can cope with the evils to which I have briefly adverted ? I wish to deal with the IHonse with the most perfect fairness, and I therefore at once avow that I desire to establish religious freedom and toleration with reference to the education of the people. (Hear, hear.) I am in favour of local contributions in support of an object which is interesting to every home in England, and I want to establish local management and control of the funds so raised. When the right hon. gentleman the member for Manchester addressed the House in favour of the educational biU which he introduced two years ago, he stated that in his opinion the division of the British public into three great parties on this question was fatal to legislation. The three great parties to whom he adverted consist, first, of the religious party-that is to say, those who are in favour of combining a religious with a secular education-of whom I am one; next of the voluntary party ; and, thirdly, of the secular party. He said that no measure on e4ucation could be passed until two of those great parties united, and that those who were most likely to unite were the first and the thirdly mentioned parties. So far as one great locality-viz., Manchester, is concerned, such a union has taken place. The bill which I desire to introduce has been prepared with the co-operation of a very Lageo committee consisting of very able men,'and representing;in equal numbers those two great parties-the religious and the secular parties if I may so caU them-who, I am thankful to say, now act cordially together, The bases upon which they have consented to act are briefly these :-Those who are favourable to religious teaching have consented that the rates shaU be expended for the benefit of secular schools, while the secular party have consented to allow the rates to be applied in support of those schools in which religion is taught. The secular party, yielded on one condition only-namely, that the money contributed by the ratepayers should not be applied directly to doctrinal religiousteaching. (Hear.) Icannot help here stating wbat in my opinion are the real objects of the secular party. In my humble judgment they made a most serious mistake in adopting that name. I believe that they ought rather to have called themselves the separate party, because their object is not to prevent religious instruction being imparted to children, but to impart secular education only through the medium of the schoolmaster, leaving religion, which they consider too sacred a matter to be mixed up in ordinary schools with secular education, to be taught by a more appropriate instructor. The most eminent leaders of the secular party are as deeply impressed with the necessity of religious instruction and as zealous for its spread as those who belong to the religious partv. I admit the force of their objection to religious edacation being impatted by the ordinary schoolmaster; but my opinions are on the opposite side. I think that religion ought to be mixed up with the whole system of education from infancy. (Hear, hear.) But before lon. gentlemen make up their minds to condemn the secular system, I beg them to look at the report of the Rev. Mr. Brookfield, given in the very last minutes of the Council on Education, and which was placed in our hands in the course of last week. Mr. Brook.
eld iS a clergyman of the church of England, and his report shows with great force the evils which arise from the imperfect system which he describes. After giving a report
of the very absurd answvers whicha the chiliren gave whem a he examined in the Catechism of the Church of England, he says
" It grieves me, who am not prone to use such words,it grieves me to think how this daily half-hour, which is usually spent in learning the Catechism by rote, and with such poor success, might have been spent in learning small portions, such as the Lord's Prayer, the Commandments, and the duties towards God and our neighbour, thoroughly and welU and with intelligenco, and how in the course of those years which result in such grotesque results as I have recited almost every recorded word of the Redeemer might bave been stored in the memory, never to bq forgotten."
That I think ought to show us that we ought not too hastily to condemn the view of those who think that the schoolmaster is not a fit person to impart religious instruction to his scholars. The basis of the arrangement between the religious and the secular parties is this, that the rate shal be granted to every school, that the religious teaching in the existing schools shaU be left precisely upon the same footing as that upon which it now rests, and that every school, whether it be a church of England school or a dissenting school, shaU bo allowed to teach Its tenets to the children who attend it, but that there shall be no violation of conscience, and therefore that children shall not be compelled to learn the creeds or Catechisms against the wish of their parents. In a speech which I lately delivered elsewhere I said that it was most desirable that any new legislation upon this subject should be in the direction rather of supplementing the existing state of affairs than of attempting to substitute another system which should be whoRy and entirely new. I have endeavoured to have this bil drawn with close attention to that principle. It proposes that the rate to be laid shall, in fact, be a rate in aid of the existing Bystem - that the pence now drawn from the children's pockets shall continue to be contributed by them - that the assistance now granted by the Committee of Council shaU not be interfered with; but that the difficulty of giving certainty and permanence to the schools, which now exists, shall be removed by means of a rate in aid, to be levied according to regulations laid down in the biU.- At one time I thought of introducing a provision giving a power to establish free schools to be supported by this rate; but upon reconsideration that part of the bill has been altered. (Hear, hear.) I should myself prefer to see the general adoption of a free system, bat r believe that at present, at all events, the country is not prepared for it and I think that it would not oe wise to introduce such a system partially by legislation. Therefore, the only provision with regard to the establishment of free schools contained in this bill is that the local committee shall in particularlocalities,after clear proof of their poverty has been given, have power either to establish free schools or to admit a certain proportion of free scholars into existing ones. I do not know that there is any otherimportant principle of the bill to which it is necessary for me to advert, with this important exception, that the framers of the bill are most anxious to make it perfectly clear that it is not intended that there shall be any interference with the management of existing schools, beyond tha' point up to which interference may be necessary and inevitable in order to insure compliance with those conditions without the observance of which the objects of the bill would not be obtained (hear, hear); but that the principle of the bill shall be with regard to religious teaching Perfect freedom of conscience, and with regard to the management and conduct of schools that there shall be no unnecessary or avoidable interference with existing arrangements. I am quite aware that I run the risk of being assailed with those imputations which have been made upon former occasions; that I may be told that I am promoting an irreligious plan (hear, hear); that I am seeking to destroy an exiting system which works wel (hear, hear), and am introducing a measure which, if successfal, will put an end to the. voluntary exertions which have done so much. (Hear, hear.) I can only say that, while I feel a profound respect for the zeal and good feelings of those who make these objections, I feel bound to disregard the objections themselves. (Hear, hear.) I wiU not consent to be diverted from the line which my sense of duty has led me to take upon this subject by objections which I conscientiously believe to be altogether erroneous and unfounded. All that I venture to ask of the House is that they will in a calm and dispassionate mauner consider the case of necessity which has been proved, without reference to party or to existing views-I won't call them prejudices.
That is the only way in which this question. which has n ow
been so long before Parliament, can be settled, andI declare my firm belief as a Christian, as a churchman, and as aa English poltician, that if Parliament will adopt the principles which I am about to propose we shall not only promote the intellectual advancement of the people, but shall do more than we can in any other way accomplish to extend soundreligion among them. On the other hand, if this bill do not pass, the discussion of such a measure can do nothing but good. I offer it as a contribution in a great cause, and I believe that the more we discuss such contributions, the more we analyze and debate this great subject, which touches every home in England, the more we shaU soften prejudiceesZ remove erroneous impressions, and elicit truth; and that tnsen we may hope ere long to arrive at a practical solution of this great and most important question. (Cheers.) The right hon. baronet concluded by moving for leave to introduce the bill.
Mr. W. F. COWPER said that he did not think that any one would oppose the introduction of the measure which the right hen, baronet had with so much perseverance, and acting £rom so high a sense of public duty, proposed for the mature and deliberate consideration of the HXouse. The right hon. baronet had shown a most conciliatory spirit by not reproducing his measure of a former year, but turning his attention to meeting the objections of some of his opponents, and introducing a bill wbich should receive the support, not only of himself and his friends, but also of some of those who had previously opposed him. Consequently, this bill was entitled to full consideration as being the result of a compromise between two parties who had hitherto been in direct and long-continued opposition to each other. He (Mfr. Cow;cer) did not at presens feel competent to judge of the character or nature of that compromise; but when the bill wag before it the House would ascertain what was the
force of the concessions which haa been made on each side. WiLth regard to religious instraction the turning point would be whether according to the terms of this compromise the master of a denominational school was to be prohibited from giving doctrinal instruction to those pupils who were of the same denomination as himself. The right hon. baronet was not very clear upon that point, which seemed to him (3fr. Cowper) to be the most important one; for if all that was asked by the seeular party was that no distinctive religious formnulary should be taught to the children of those parents who objected to it, that was no more than was constantly done in national schools, the directors of nany of which allowed children whose parents objected to their being present to absent themos es during the time set apart for the teacling of religions formularies. The principle which was contained in the.bill introdaced by the right hon. member for MIanchester (Mr. M. Gibson), and which was advocated by the secular party, was that no distinctive doctrine should be taught to the children by the schoolmaster. That was a principle to which the denominational party in this country was not prepared to accede, and therefore if it formed part of this comp'romise the right hon. baronet would meet with a very formidable opposition from that party. To deprivo the schoolmaster of the right of giving any doctrinal iastruction was to say that he should only give to his pupils a certain amount of information upon secular subjects, but should not appeal to their consciences, should not give them moral or spiritual training, should be altogether silent upon everything which related to their higher faculties, and should not teach them the grand sanue tions of all moral obligations. In the biU to whsch he had referred, however, it was said that, although the schoolmaster was not to teach doctrinal religion, he was to inculcate truthfulness, morality, and the other virtues. It was assumed by those who prepared that bill that it was perfectly easy to inculcate all the cardinal virtues without teaching doctrinal religion. From that position he (Air. Cowper) entirely dissented. How could the master teach a child his duty to himself without a reference to the self-denying principles and examples of Christianity; his duty to his neighbour, without teaching him somethig of Christian love; or his duty to the Almilghty, without speakdng to him of the covenant under which he is placed, and his relationship as the child of a heavenly Father? (Hear, hear.) To say that the schoolmaster should not teach doctrinal religion might amount to saying that he should teach no morality, and that he should not inculcate the conscientious duty of acting rightly. If, howrever, it wrere only intended to prohibit the schoolmaster from teaching certain formuisries, then he (MIr. Cowper) had nO objection to the arrangement. The right hon. baronet had referred to the faulty manner in which the Catechism had boon taught in certain schools inspected by the Rev. Mr. Brookfield; but it seemed to him (Ur. Cowper) thatthis did not go so much against the teaching of the Catechism altogether as against the mode in which it was taught; and he was afraid that the teaching of it only at aparticularhour instead of allowing it to be enclosed and enveloped, as it were, in the ordinary teaching of the schoolmaster, would have a direct tendency to encourage its being taught in a perfunctory and ill-arranged manner-being learned by rote, and not being understood. Upon this point, however, and upon others connected with the atrangement mentioned by the right hon. baronet, he would not now pronounce an opiulon, because the House was not sufficiently informed upon the subject. To the other principles stated by the right hon. baronet he thought that no reasonable objection could be taken. Whatever maight be the objections to proceeding by a voluntary and local arrangement, yet at present this was the only way in vhich we could proceed. It was pretty clear that no system of national education to be supported by rate could be adopted so as to be compulsory upon the whole country, but it was quite possible that certam parts of the country-such, for instance, as the city of Manbchester, which was most anxious to be allowed to rate itself ("No, no," from Mr. Hadfield)mIght gladly adopt some such system as that now proposed. There was also great use in dealing separately with towns and rural districts, as there was always a difference in the circumstances of those two classes of places, which rendered it essential that there should be distinctions made in the mode in which they were dealt with. The right hon. baronet had qnoted as precedents two cases of successful permissive legislation. Perhaps he (3r. Cowper) might be allowed to add to these the Public Health Act) which had now been adopted very extensively throughout the country, and under which many large towns had obtained advantages which they would have rejected and repudiated had it been sought to force the measure upon the whole country at first. He was glad that the school committee to be elected by the ratepayers was to have no power to interfere with the manage. ment of existing schools, because such a provision would preserve the groat advantages of the present system, the voluntary management of particular schools with aid from the general funds in the country, and would add such further assistance as conld be giveD by a local central authority. As regarded the help to be given to schools from local rates, he thought that any one who had witnessed the great difficulty experienced by the friends of education in raising the funds necessary for the support of schools must feel that such assistance would be a great benefit to them, especially the clergymen who were now constantly obliged to provide from their poor pittances funds for the support of schools which they did not like to see neglected. If the arrangements proposed by the right hon. baronet for establishing a system of local permissive rating were agreed to, the benevolent persons who were now bearing the burden of supporting the schoolsof this country would be releved from the neeessity of attending to the wants of children .uder 11 orl2 years of age, and would be able to devote their attention to those young men and women wbo, having left the primary scheols, needed help to enable them to pursue their studies in the evening, and we should then make some real advanceo in the education of the people. (Hear, hear.) He could not at present commit the Governmnt to the adoption of any particular course in regard to this measure; hut ho should offer no opposition to its introduction. (Rear, hear.)
Mlr. E. BALL complimented the right hon. baronet (Sir J. Pahngton) upon his industry and perseverance, but expressed his opinion that a system of education to be national must be religious. He therefore regretted that the right hon. baronet had introduced a biU which, to a great extent, excluded religious teaching, and had accepted the secular, which on former occasions he had himself repudiated and rejected (Hear, hear.)
Lord B. CECIL said that this was an attempt to get in the thin end of the wedge, which was sought to be introduced by the resolutions of the noble lord the member for the city of London (Lord J. Russell), which were so signally defeated. The instancing of the police bill, which had Just been changed fromapermissivetoa compulsorymeasure, was a blear intimation of what was the ultimate intention of the right hon. baronet, and showed that the only advantage over the rural districts which he designed for the towns was that of being eaten first. Having caught the towns, hefully intended to catch the rural distrcts, which he said required such a measure still mote. In his representation of the several parties into which the friends of education were divided the right hon. baronet had entirely forgotten the adherentsto the Privy Council system. His (Lord Robart Cecil's) objection to this measure was that its supporters were too hasty, that they were in too great a hurry, and would not allow the existing system to be sufEiciently tried. That system had been in existence only 10 years; we had had no census for six years, and we had therefore actual information as to the result of only four years of its operation. It was hasty and unjust to condemn a system on such slender evidence as this. The right hon. gentleman had, it-seemed, for the-.irst time discovered that the secularists were not anxious to prevent children receiving religious instruction in the course of their educa-
tion. If he ever entertained the belief that the supporters of the secular scheme had such anxiety, he must have entertained it alone in that house, for no one else could ever beleve that persons of sense, persons knowing the feelings of the people of this country, would seek to exclude religion from education. He had found 1bat they sought merely to exclude religion from tbe domain of the schoolmaster, be. cause he taught it -inefficiently, and he cited the report of the Rev. Mr. Brookfield, who said that we ought to provide more efficient instruments for teaching religion; but did this biU provide them? The right hon. baronet had regaled the House with figures showing the frightful ignorance and destitutien in which the juvenUe population of our large towns were plunged; but would he tell them that the homes of these children would furnish them with more efficient religious teaching than that now given by the sdhoolmaster, and to which he soughtWto put an end? He had said that the money of the ratepayers was not to be applied to the support of doctrinal teaching, but he had at the same time said that it was to be applied in aid of ex. isting schools. Would he tell the House howr many schools there were in the country in which doctrinal religion was not taught ? It was of no use urging other objections, because the right hon. baronet had given notice that he did not intend to be convinced (a laugh); and he (Lord Robert Cecil) would therefore confne him.,If to the expression of his opinion that in exact proportion as you raised money by a rate in that exact proportion would subscriptions fail off. In supportof this position he appealed to the experience of any hon. members who had during the last fewv years been eng aged in promoting the establishment of reformatories. He had
neard or cases, and he had no doubt there were numbers of instanCes, in which persons had promiised to subscribe to the erection of reformatories by means of private funds, but withdrew their subscriptions as soon as they heard that the Govermuent was going to contribute. It had been tried in a hundred cases and had always failed. You never woald get both voluntary subscriptions and Government aid for the same object and within the same limits. (fRear, hear.)
Mr. COBDEN.-The objection urged by the noble lord who has just spoken has rather surprised me. He accused the right hon. bart. (Sir J. Pakington) of haste. Now, I think it is more than 20 years since this question of education was launched in this house. I have witnessed the discussion of many knotty subjects in this country, and have been a party to some, and have always been accustomed to consider that seven years is about the natural duration of any agitation or any great movement for effecting an important political change. This measure of education has to my knowledge had three seven years of discussion in this house, and therefore I think that, whatever other fault maybe laid to the charge of the right hon. baronet opposite, he onght not to be accused of haste or precipi. tancy. I do not now intend to go into the details of a bill which is not before us, but I have always been prepared for the difficulty which has already been thrown in our way-the question of religious teaching. The noble lord who has just spoLen asked whether it was intended that the rate should be applied to pay for doctrinal teaching. I answer, "No; that is not contemplated." (Hear, hear.) The essential difference between this bil and others which have been brought into this house is that while it leaves denomisiations to teach religion in their own schools it does not propose to raise a rate to pay for that
teaching; and it at the same time stipulates that parties having schools in connoxion with churches Or chapels shaU set apart a particular time when their own doctrinal religious instruction shall be given, and during that time they shall not be subject to the inspection of the inspectors, nor shaU children who are not of the religious denomination to which the achool belongs be required to attend. Well, surely there is nothing so difficult about this that it cannot be accomplished, if we are in earnest and wish to accomplish it. It is not a question of principle, but merely a question between 9 o'clock in tho morning and some other hour. If I am to be told that it is not possible to set apart a particular portion of the day when the Catechism can be taught, it must bh equaUy impossible to set apart a parti. cular hour for the teaching of geography, arithmetic, history, or any other sutbject; yet it is essential to the wellU ordering of a school that you should have a time for each subject, that the times should be defined by the master, and that one study should not run into another. (Hear, hear.) Surely, if doctrinal religious teaching be of that importance which those who object to the right hon. baronet's bill attach to it, you yoarselves will eay that it is of so much moment that a time should be named when such instraction should be given. It is done already. When this subject comes to be fully discussed it will be found that your national schools have already adopted this plan; that many national schools are now receiving children of all denominations, with the understanding that they are not to be taught the Catechism. And how are you to carry out that in good faith, unless you have a particular time when the Catechism is taught? Then seo how the middle classes overcome the difficulty. In the city of London you wiU find a school kept by that excellent man Dr. Mortimer, who wiU tell you that he has I,ows, Roman Catholics, and every denomination of children. If you ask him how he gets over this difflculty, he will tell you what every man who is worthy to be at the head of a school wil teU you, that he has forms of prayer-which he will show you-which are read by the children; aud that when his is over he directs their attention to French, to German, o mathematics, or to classics, but that he does not, nor would any other man of sense, run one study into another and blend in the minds of his pupils things which are en. tirely unoonnected with each other. There is really no difficulty, and the reason why I am so glad that the ribht hon. baronet has brought in a permssive bill is this, that when the matter comes to be put to a practical test, when you have one municipality which does itself the honour to lay a rate in the cause of education, you will find that all this religions difficulty will vanish (hear, hear), and that we have been amusing, or rather terrifying ourselves for 20 years with a mere bugbear. (Hear, hear.) There is no practical difficulty in the matter. In the Bluecoat School you have from 300 to 500 boys, but you have no difficulty about this religious question. There are also in different parts of kthe country many proprietary schools. There is the celebrated school at Birmingham, of which the present Bishop of Manchester was head master, and it is his boast that no one was ever excluded on account of his religious opinions. The Bishop of Manchester gives his sanction and approval to this measure. He was head master of this Birmingham school, in which there were 1,200 or 1,300 boys. He had children of all denominations, but he did not attempt to proselytize them and turn them from the faith to which they belonged to his own. There is really no difficulty about this question if we set honestly to work; and I do sincerely hope that at this day, in the year 1857, we shall not lay ourse ves open to the reproach which was made by Sir Samuel Romilly in his diary some 30 years ago. When speaking of the discussions concerning education in this house, he wrote,-" I am afraid that people are not in earnest about education ; that they are afraid of the tax that would be imposed upon them to educate the people." We have come to a time when we are all in earnest, all wishing for a betterl system. If so, I do not tlinak we shall have any difficulty in carrying out some plan, and I don't think there has been any scheme submitted to the HIouse more likely to meet with general acquiescence than that which the right hon. baronet has proposed. I do aot intend now to go into details, but I thought it necessary to allude to the religious difficulty, which has been thrown in our faces so long that it is high time that we should in some localitylput to the test this great bughear, which I apprebend will instantly vanish, and we shall then find that we have been alarming ourselves with a shadow. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. HENLEY.-Sir, I am quite ready to concede at the outset that the discussion of questions of this kind does good, and leads eventually to the discovery of the troth - but I disagree with my right hon. friend as to the effect of the decision which the House came to on his scheme las' year. It is taking a very narrow view of that decision to say that it was based on the simple fact that the measure was intended to be general and compulsory in its operation The bill of my right hon. friend both last year and the year preceding was objectionable because it would have completely sapped, and ultimately done away with, the existing system of education; and that was the ground on which the House rejected it. The hon. gentleman who spoke last told as that the religious difficulty is a bugbear, and that no man of common sense has any trouble in overcoming it. Every man has a perfect right to hold his own opinions, but the assumption of the hon. member unquestionably implles that some three-fourths of the people of this country are destitute of common sense. ("Hear, hear," and a laugh,) A great many persons, quite as earnest in the cause of education as the hon. gentleman, have applied their minds formany years to this subject, without discovering religious education to be a bugbear.
Mr. COBDEN.-The right hon. gentleman mnst excuse me. I attach as much importance to religious education as he does. I say the bugbear is-not religious instruction, but-the difficulty of separating doctrinal from secular instruction.
Mr. HENLEY.-I thank the hon. gentleman for his correction, because I am the last person who would fix upon another man the result of my own misapprehension; but he must allow me to say that the religious teaching which is confined to half-an-hour or an hour per day, and is imparted simply as you would teach French, German, and mathematics, or as you would give any other lesson, is not a teaching lkely to reach the hearts of children, but will prove wholly barren and inoperative. Religion must bo diffulsed over the whole surface of their training, or it can never be useful in regulating their conduct. Hence arises the difficulty when the matter comes to be fairly worked out. This point was well touched upon by the right hon. gentleman opposite (Mr. Cowper), who said that if this important branch of instruction could be limited to half an hour each day it might be easily dealb with, but that when you come to teach the child his rule of life doctrinal religion meets you at every turn and constitutes your real difficulty. (Hear, hear.) As far as 1 gathered from my right hon. friend's statement, he makes no provision whatever for new schools. How, then, is the deficiency to be supplied ? All that his scheme does is this,-there being a certain nunber of schools now in existence, the greater proportion of veich are attached to some religious denomination or another, it is proposed that you should aid the funds of these schools by a rate. This is what myright lion. friend, in very gentle language, calls a local contribution. (A laugh.) Why, we have local contributions now, only they happento be voluntary, and are not exacted by the taxcollector. My right hon. friend, putting his case with great skill, said, " I am for local contributions and local management." Well, so am I for local contributions and local management; but I am also for religions freedom. How does my right hon. friend deal with that point? There are numerous schools in the country, each affiliated to some religious community, at whose cost, either entirely or in the main, they have been built and supported; and what has been the great incentive to the public to devote its money and, what is a thousand times more valuable, its time, for the organization of the vast machinery now at work? Undoubtedly, the mainspring of it all has been the desire to give a religious education to the children of their neighbours. (Hear, hear.) In this state of things my right hon. friend interposes. "True," he says, "'you have got your schools and your schoolmasters; true, you are making no complaints; but I think you have not enough money. I must levy a rate and pay you a certain sum from it for every child that comes under your training." The schools, however, having been established on the express condition that the scholars are to have religious instruction, my right hon. friend says, " I wil give you money to take a number of children who shall receive no religious instruction at al." That is the principle of his scheme. Let us see how it would work. Suppose a Presbyterian school to be set up in a locality where many Roman Catholic children reside. The Prcsbyterianschoolmaster isto becompeUed-onthe principle of religious freedom, forsooth 1-to admit any number of these Roman Catholic children for whom there is room in his school, and to teach them everything else, but not a word of religion. What is that but ignoring rehion altogether, under the specious guise of relious freedom, and doing palpable violence to the consiences of the men who, in order to give instruction, set on foot almost your
present machinery, and who are nevertheless to have pupiis thrust upon them (in place of those whom they now teach) of whose education religion is to form no part? True, my right hon. friend says he is for religious instruction, but the supporters of the secular system hold that the school is not the place for teaching religion.
Sir J. PAKINGTON.-I do not say so.
Mr. HIENLEY.-I am aware that my right hon. friend does not say this, but his new allies do. He differs in opinion from them, but then he proposes a scheme that will do exactly what they say-not what he says. (" Hear, hear," and a laugh.) The House must not run away with the notion that this bill is only permissive. Permissive for what ?-that is the question. Is it under the vote of a narrow majority, obtained m a canvass you don't know how, to permit a system to be set up for giving any instruction, except religious? If so, whero there are 100 people in a place, and 51 of them are favourable to such a proposal, the remaining 49 being strongly opposed to it, this large minority will be taxed, against their consciences, to teach anything in the world except our duty to God and man. (" Oh," aud " Hear, hear.",) I caunot believe that the people of this country will ever be content with su.ch a state of things ; and inso grave a matter I for one doubt whether they ought to be allowed to establish it. I know it is said that unless persons possess a great deal of secular knowledge 7our labour in attempting to give them religious instruction is thrown away. (Cries of "oear. hear,' in which Sir J. Pakington was understood to join.) My right hon. friend cheers that statement. I am sorry to bear him cheer it. Al I ean say is that I differ fromn that opinion as much as light differs from darkness. I do net
beievethatthemost ignorant man who ever drew the breath of leaven was not amenable to the truths of Christianity. (Cheers.) Those who have had the most extensive experience on this point will tell yon that the best examples of a truly Christian spirit are often furnished by
the most illiterate of our fellow creatures. (Ilear, hear.) The Divine message of mercy to man is so wonderfuly adapted to the wants of man that while the humblest peasant can understand and receive its graciouS accents, the highly inteUectual and most cultivated of our race will esteem ittheirgreatestprivilege to snbmlb themselves to its lessons of humility, (Hear, hear.) If yost assert that our duty to God and man is to be sought only through the inteUect, yon have only arrived, as the re3usi of seven years of discussion, at what you might easlly have seen from the beginning was tho radical difference between us. I say that you must invert theprocess. You mustfirst teach our duty to God and man, and as a conseeuence ot that teaching induce people to cultivate their intelects acr cording as their means and opportunities enable them. (Cheers.) I hold, then, that you never wiU teach theyoung their duty to God or man if you attempt to do dt througl_ the intellcpt. Such an attemnpt strikes at the root of the. whole religious teaching of this country; and I trust, that; when my right hon. friend's bill is before us it wiU not be found to be based on so pernicious a principle. If, however, it is otherwise, I can only promise to give him my warmest opposition. Thera is an essential difference of opinion on this subject, between two parties in this house; but I am not sorry that thisdiscussionhas been raised, because I believe it will elucidate the truth. (}Hear, hear.)
Lord J. RUSSELL.-I am glad, Sir, that the right hone gentlemnan the member for Droitwich has again brought ths question of national education before the attention of thia House. I cannot but admit-although I do so reluctantly-.
that the best, or at least the most prudent, course is to mak3 the bil merely permisdve and local. At the same time, I have no wish now, any more than on auy former occasion, to conceal my individual opinion that it is the duty of this country to render national education compulsory and peremptory. Yet I am quite aware that that is not th3 view taken by this House, and that such differences of opinion prevail among the public that it would be utterly impossible at present to obtain a general assent to any plait founded on such a principle. I think, however, that thes right hon. gentleman does well in endeavouring to take a step in advance with the view of giving anupetus to this' great question. I am afraid, indeed, th he lprospeobefore us, partially opened though it is, is not quite so encouraging as the right hon. gentleman seems to imagine; and that local and permissive as this measure is, and con.. fined to promoting the success of the existing schools thougb. it appears to be, still it is liable to misconceptions and nui. representations, producing unfavourable opnins, whichx always impede the progress of a measure of th.is kind. The right hon. gentleman, in some degree representing as he does the sentiments of others, seems to me rather to place a bar in the way of his Own bill when he isays that the rates are not to go towards religious instruction. What is intended is that they shall be applied in aid of schools belonging to different religious denominations, in whicb, under the present system, doctrinal instruction is given.
Sir J. PAKINGTON.-My expression was, "not directly applied."1
Lord J. RUSSELL.-I do not quite see the value of that distinction. The rate will go in aid of a national schoolsay, in Birmingham or elsewhere, and that school will continue to give doctrinal instruction in precisely the same manner as it is hitherto done-that is to say, the Bible will be read, the Catechism taught, and the great truths of Christianity impressed on the pupils exactly as is the case now. Therefore there is no room whatever for the question just raised by the right hon. gentleman (Mx. Henley) -viz., whether religion should be taught by the inteUect, or whether the heart is to be reached at once (hear, hear) - because that religious instruction is still to be continuenwithwhichtlhat right hon.gentleman himself andalso the noble lord (Lord B. Cecil) are perfectly satisfied. The only question regarding the application of the rate is that the money will not be directly and professedly given for the purposes of that doctrinal instruction; that that instruction will bo imparted at certain fixed hours, which will be duly notified; and that children may be admitted who do not accept it, and who will be absent during the time that it is given. But, then, it is not a correct description of the scheme to say that the rates wiU not go in aid of doctrinal teaching. They vil support the school; and tha school will still remnain a national or a denominational scho6l, as the case may be, in which religious insteuction
wil be given exactly as heretofore. I have heard of a pro. position, emanating, I believe, from a section of thevoluntary party in Scotland, to the effect that, while consenting to givo religious instruction in the public schools, there slould tea. separatepaymentforthatinstmution.Thisappearstomeaverg objectionable propoual, but I don't understand it to fornm any Vart of the night hon. gentleman's scheme. Therefore, notvwthstanding all the objections urged to his plan, the right hon. gentleman does propose that this rate shoulX form an additional fund for schools in which religious instruction is given, and given, too, not according to a mode of which some hon. members disapprove, although I do not -viz., by the teaching of the Bible only, but according tV the form now adopted in the national and many other schools. This being so, it does not appear to me that tho right hon. gentleman has made any such dangerous concession to the secular party as the last speaker seems to suppose. On the contrary, that has itself made an important concession-namely, that the religious teaching of the schools shaU be supported from the rates, provided only that regilous hberty is not infringed by compeling those of the pupils to attend such instruction whose parents dissent from it, and that it is given at certain fixed hours, to be duly notifiedL The right hon. gentleman elsewhere stated fairlr the opinion of the secular party when he said that they hold that the children ought to be reigiously brought up but that the schoolmaster is not the person nor the schooi thu place for doing so. My view, agreeing with that of the right hon. gentleman, is, on the other hand, that the school is the place and the schoolmaster the person. (Hear, hear.) At the same time, if you support a school by rates-if your require that people not of one, but of mauy different denominations, be they Presbyterians, Roman Catholics, or Jews, shall contribute towards the maintenance of thab school-you cannot after that well insist that only a particular kind of doctrinal instrtuction shall bo given, or that the children of those who do not receive that instruction shall be excluded from the school. Thus far I think the bill of the right hon. gentleman accords with the principle of religious liberty, I don't quite understand whether or not he proposes to assist by a rate a school in which the secular principle is followed, and no rehigiour instruction given. (Hear, hear.) Such a provision, it; formed part of the measure, might create considerable difaculty. thas hadno place in any scheme which either the right hon. gentleman or I have ventured to propose to the House. We shall, however, be better able to judge of this bill when we have had an opprtuni of carefully examining itS various clauses; and I can only trust that until that time no hon. ,gentleman wll raise a prejudice against ah scheme intended by its author as a concession to objections which he does not himself feel, but by conciliating which hea hope.s to be able to take a step towards the attainment of , proper system of national education. For my own part, I heartily wish the right hon. gentleman every suceegs, and sincerely trust he may be able to obviate the objections eG which his scheme is liable. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. HADFIEILD regretted that the right hon. gentleman (Sir J. Paldngton), in his review of the educational condition of this country, had omitted to notice the 2,500,000 children now regularly receiving instruction, under upwardsof 300,000 teachers, in theSundayschools of this country. The right hon. gentlemen had hitherto identified his advocacy of education with a section of the clergy of the established church, but he now suddenly turned round and threw himself into the armsi of the secular party, whose views he sought to embody in his scheme. HIe lately went down to Manchester to hold a conference with the leaders of that party, and in a two hours' interview with them he professed to have settled this great question off hand for the whole world. How powerful must the spell of the right hon. gentleman's genius be when with a single wave of s wand he could set at rest the vexed question that had so long agitated th coountry I (A laugh.)
Sir J. PAIINGTON.-I never said that.
Mr. HADFIELD had not heard the statement himself
his only authority for it was the newspaper reports. This. bill would stir up and perpetuate a greater amount of secraran.bitterness from one end of the country to the other than had ever been produced by the agitation about churchrates or 3Maynooth. The Roman Catbolics would not send their children to the Protestant schools, and the consequence would be that the Roman Catholic schools. would also have to be supported from the propoeed rates. The hon. member for North Warwickshire (Mr. Spooner) vehemently condemned the vote of 26,0001. a-year from tha pubhc funds for the College of Maynooth; but what would he say to a measure like this, which would probably saddlaF the people with taxation to the extent of several hundreds of thousands per annum for the support of a religion often deacribed by the hon. gentleman in terms which he (Mr.
ladfield) would not venture to repeat? (Laughter.) Thesacred principles of reigion were made the football of parties in that house who ought to set the people an example of respect for them. He was confident that this bill woul.d he unpopular with the country, and w Bould share, as it de.- serve dto do, the fate of its unluckq predecessors.
Mr. W. EWART said that the state of education in oun rural districts was positively disgraceful, and that untit the education of the female population in the humblest. ranks of life was better attended to, instead of being, as at present, grossly neglected, it 'was vain to expectthe home training of the young to be wbat it ought to be. The, trne system of national education was the voluntary system,
but that would be best conducted by xneans of a rate. (" Oh.") If a rate could only be imposed, as ih
the case of the Libraries Act, by the declared wilL of the majority, was not that essentially a voluntary species of taxation? Religious training was, no doubt, the. highest object of all education, but then religious instruc-
tion was perfectly compatible with religious freedom. This. biU sanctioned doctrinal teaching where it now prevailed
and} did not impose the secular system whero it did not. exist. If the right hon. gentlemanwould introduce a clause providing that, while the religious teachina should be free,
the conductors of a school should neverth. eEs see that no child was left without religious instruction of one taind or another, religious freedom would thereby be maintained In-
violate, and religious instruction at the same time extended_ It was quite right to make this a permissivo bi only, and it.
was to be hoped that when the good effects of the svstent had been shown in one or two instances it would be adoptedc generally throughout the country. Under the Factory Act; a certificate of attendance at school must be produced befor& any child could be employed, and he was i votur of extending this principle to agricultural laboui as welL A crisis had now arrived in the educational question, and itc behoved aU parties to unite to solve it in a conciJiatory
spirit, for unless somoe system of national education wero adopted there was but little hope of preserving our pros perity or of bettering the condition of the people.
Sir J. PAKIGTON, in reply, expressed a hope that for the future, whenever his noble friend the member forStamford intended to follow him in debate, he would ha kind enough to make a note of his observations, for on the.
present octaaion~ the noble lord had So altered what bafiv
faUen from him that he could by no means acoopt as his own the opinions 'Which he had attributed to him. His right hon. friend the member for Oxfordshlre had pointed out as an omission that there was no provision for new schools in this bill i but that wsas done advisedly. Every one who had studiee this question knew that it was much more Hifficult to maintain a school than to establish one; indeed, he knew of a case in Shropshire where an excelent schoolIouse had been built for at least 18 months, and when ho last beard of it it had not yet been opened for want of fuLds to meet the current expenses. Another objection n,ade by his right hon. friend was, that under this bill a i-trielly denominational school would be obliged to admit * hikren of any other denomination-a Presbyterian school, for instance, would be obliged to receive Roman Catholics; 'but his answer to that was,that it would bein the discretion ".f a 1resbyterian or of any other school to decide whether i t would apply for the aid which this bill held out, and if it -did ajply it could only of course receive that aid by subscribing tothe conditions which were laid down. (Hear.) He t ntirely agreed with his right hon. friend that the humblest among us were accessible to the divinetruths of Christianity; isut he would appeal to tho experience of the ministers of seligion who exercised their duty in the crowded districts of cur great towns to say whether the state of intelectual ignorance and low debasement in which too large a part of the population was sunk was not a great practical bar to the teaching of religious truiths. (Hear, hear.)
The motion was then agreed to, and the bill was subse. quently brought in and read a first time.
ENCUMBERED ESTATES COURT.
Mr. WHITESIDE, in moving for a return relating to the removal of Baron Richards fromn the Encumbered Estates Court, said he wished to call the attention of the House to a report which appeared in the newspapers to the effect that ? new place had just been created in this Court, with a a salary of 3,0001. a-year, an announcement which had, no doubt, excited very pleasurable emotions in certain quarters. About two years ago a commission was appointed to get at the true state of affairs in.the lEncumbered Estates Court, and this commission, oddlyienough- though certainly it was onl]Xollowing the recent fashion of law reform in 'this cou? ,,had proposed to get rid of the arrears ,oy thxov>Tr the whole Court into Chancery. A *ifference abising in that House when legislation was proposed on the subject, a select committee was appointed, on which some of the most eminent members of rhe House sat, with the Attorney-General for Ireland in the chair. The proposition made by the Government before that committee wan rather a strange one. It was asserted that two Vice-Chancellors could transact all the business of the Court of Chancery now done by four Masters with their staff of clerks, all the business of the Encumbered Estates Court, and clear off all the arrears. Two of the commissioners-Dr. Longfield and Mr. Hargreave-were examined before the coliniittee, and gave evidence in support of this proposition. W\'hen pressed on the amount of "arrears," 4hey objected to tho term altogether, and preferred to calU 'then, by the name of "business undone," but in the course of transaction; and they further stated that they were able 'to clear Off all the business of the court as it came in. 3aron Richards was not sumnmoned over, but it was taken for granted that the business in his court was pretty much in the same condition. It turned out that these two gentlemen were engaged two days a-week in hearing appeals from each other, and it naturally suggested itself to the committee that if a now court of appeal were appointed and these two conimissioners sat separately every day in the week, they might be able to do all the business of the court, and Baron I1ichards might be sent back to his own court. It 'was understood that this arrangement would be carried out, and it might therefore have been expected that some formal notice would be given to the other two commissioners that Baron Richards was to be sent back to his own court in order that they might make arrangements for the transaction of the business of his court. But no such notice was given to them-this he had from one of the commissioners-and to the surprise of everybody a notice was posted one fine morning on the door of the learned baron's court announcing that ho was removed altogether. On inquiry it turned out that there were 700 petitions in Baron , ichards's office and 500 abstracts of titles which were unread, and which it was absolutely necessary should be Tead before any of the estates to which they referred could he put up for sale. No information as to this enormous amount of arrears had been laid before the committee. He hiuped the House would not allow any new appointment to be made without having some clear information as to what was the real state of things in the court. The hon. and learned gentleman concluded by moving for a return of any communications addressed to the Commissioners for the Sale of Encumbered Estates in Ireland, or to any of them, relating to the removal of Baron Richards from the cffice of Chief Comnmissioner, and of the dates of said comanunications, if any; of the order or comUmunication address,ed to Baron Richards, containing his removal from said court, and of the date of same; and of any order or warrant for the appointment of a third conmmissioner since the renioval of Baron Richards.
Mr. HORSMAN said there was no objeotion to grant the return moved for by the hon. and learned gentleman. The statement be had just miiade, however, was founded on a report which, if lhe h2d taken the trouble to inquire, he .would have found to be entirely inicorrect. The bon. and learned gentleuman complained that no information had been furnished to the committee as to the state of arrears of busi-
ess in Baron Richards's office; but, in fact, all the returns xelating to the business of the court had been laid before the committee. As to the surprise caused by Baron Richards's remloval, he couild not conceive any more public mode of announcement than the statement made by the noble lord at the kead of the Government last session in that hlouse, that it was intended to send the learned baron back to his own court. On that occasion, while agreeing to try the experiment, Eo strenuously pressed by the hon. and learned gentleman-of working the court with only twvo commissioners-the noble lord expressly stated that the Government would retain the pJower of appointing a third commissioner if it were necesnaary. Tl'he experient of two commissioners had hardly been tried three weeks before there was such an arrear of business as to bhow that the very existence of the court would be imperilled unless additional assistance were afforded to it. The Government had therefore deter. miined to take steps to appoint a third commissioner, but nio warrant had yet been made out.
It being now a quarter before 0 o'clock, beyond which hour, according to the rnles of the HIouse, no debate can be p rolonged, the right hon. gentleman sat down abruptly, and the subject dropped.

MONEY-MABK8Tatid OITYwaTLLIGEiOB
WednesdayEvening.
The English funds exlibited increased firmness this morning, and have been well maintained throughout the day. Consols for money, which, after regular hours last evening, advanced to 930 to ., opened at 93i to E for money, and 94 to i for the 5th of March, from which there was no variation to the close of business. Money was in better supply in the Stock Exchange and the discountmarket, and the applications at the Bank were not numerous. There was also an absence of gold withdrawals. Bank Stock left oif at 217 to 219; Reduced, 94 to i; New Three per Cents., 94i to #
India Stock, 219 to 221; India Bonds, 2s. discount to Is. premium; Exchequer-bonds, 98i to I; and Exchequer-bills, par to 3s. premium.
Foreign securities were firmer, but the highest prices were not wholly maintained at the close. In Turkish Six per Cents. transactions for the account took place at 95g, i, i, and 1. The Four per Cents. Guaranteed were purchased for money at 101ft, and for the account at 10li. The general business comprised-Brazilian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 971; Mexican, for money, 22i ; for the account, 22i aild 22; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., for the account, 80 ; Russian Five per Cents., 110 and 109- ; the Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 97, 974', 97, and 97 ; Sardinian, 90; Spanish Three per Cents., for account, 40g5; the New Deferred, 24g and i; Spanish Certiticates, 01 and # per cent. ; Belgian Foitr-and-a-Half per Cents., 99; and the Four per Cents.

l. St. Petersburg to Vilna or Kovno. 2. Vilna or Kovno to Warsaw. "3. Moscow to Koursk.
"4. Koursk to Theodosia.
"5. hoursk or Orel to Dunabourg. "6. Duuabourg to Libau.
"7. Mloscow to Nijnei Novgorod.
"As each of these sections is finished the guarantee of 5 per cent. comes into operation upon it, irrespective of the remaining sections.
*' The capital of the line from St. Petersburg to Warsaw is to be takenl at 13,600,0001.
"That of the branch to Konigsberg 69,000 roubles per verst (or about 16,4001. per mile) ; and on the other lines at 62,500 roubles per verst (or about 14,850I. per mile.)
" On the sumns advanced by the State to make up the guaranteed profit of 5 per cent., 4 per cent. shall be charged as interest, and these sums and the interest upon thens shall be repaid to the State out of the surplus profits beyond 5 per cent.
"When the net profit of the Wasaw line shall exceed 5uer cent. on the capital estimated for it, one-half of the surpSus slhall be paid to the State until that payment shall amount to 2,Ss0,0001., the sonm it has paid for works on the line.
" The Governmenit may purchase the whole of the lines after 30 years from the date of the concession on payment of an annuity, which shall in no case be less than the amount of the guaranteed interest (5 per cent.).
'- In buying back the lines the company is to be repaid For any extra stock, &c., it rmay have found necessary to add after the original stocking of the lines.
"The Government undertakes to grant no competing lines for 20 years, and if it does after that time the company to have the pre-emption of the concession.
" Soldiers to pay one-fourth of the ordinary tariff horses, baggage, and military stores one-half of the ordinary
"All materials to be admitted duty free duriing construe. tiors, and no stamp duties or other dues to be levied on the transactions for purchase of land, &c.
" The Moscow Railway to carry everything during construction at cost price."
The above it will be seen involves no material difference from the general features previously announced. The great facts for notice are that the 45 millions sterling must be suipplied by the contractors at all costs within 10 years from the date of the concession, thus insuring a constant flood of Russian securities to deDreciate the original issues, and that no certainty can be given as to the adequacy of the amount allou-ed per mile.
It is niow estimated that the Peninsular and Oriental steamer Colombo, to sail on the 20th for India, will take out 600,0001., principally silver. For the succeeding mail of the 4th, which will include remittances to China, about 230,0001. is already engaged. Notwithstanding these arrangenients, the stock of silver on the market has not been entirely absorbed, and the price to-day has shown increased heaviness.
All the stages of the great dock warrant question connected w'ith the case of " Kingsford v. Merry" appear worthy of each other. In the first instance the Court of Exchequer decided that Messls. Merry and Sons, as innocent holders of a dock warrant for a valuable consideration, could not be forced to refund its proceeds, although the warrant had been wrongfully acquired by the person from whom they received it as a pledge; This was perfectly in accordance with the feeling of the mercantile community, and the judgment was rendered still more satisfactory by a declaration from Chief Baron Pollock, that if any other view were to be adopted it would be impossible for business to be safely carried on. Upon a further hearing, moreover, before a full Court the bench re-afiinred the decision. It was then, however, carried by appeal before the Court of Error, and here the judgment was reversed. The scandal of such contradictions having attracted great attention, it was apologetically represented that none of the judicial authorities were at variance, but that the difference between the two decisions had been consequent upon the case having been differently stated before the two Courts. The solicitors and counsel employed forthwith proved that this allegation was erroneous, and that all the points placed before the one Court had been equally submitted to the other. The fact that the confusioni lay with, the Courts theinselves,. and that the only means of obtaining an absolute declaration of what the law really is would be by an appeal to the House of Lords having thus been established, the mercantile community considered it timee to urge on the Goveriunent the necessity of introducing a measure that would free them for the future fror the danger and uncertainty of such ruinous litigation, and at the same time fix the
matter on a basis in conformity with the principles which had always been considered to prevail. Although nothing is more difficult than to induce the merchants and bank-ers of London to move in a body on any commercial subject, their action in this case was prompt and vigorous, and at one of the largest and most influential meetings ever held a committee was appointed by a vote, to which there was only a single dissentient, to adopt the requisite proceedings. Baron Rothschild, as member for London, occupied the chair, and heartily concurred in the resolutions. The next that is heard of the question is that the Government would be happy to promote an adjustment of the law, but that they havwahad no satisfactory- evidence that the mercantile community entertain any general wish upon the subject. On the contrary, they knew that " the chairman of the meeting (Baron Rothschild) was himself opposed to the objects of it." A public and unequivocal statement then followed that this idea about Baron Rothschild was an entire mistake, of a piece with all the other discrepancies of the affair. Next comes a communication from Mir. Freshfield, addressed to the Committee of Merchants, deprecoating any change in the existing law. This at all events seemed calculated to exercise a definite influence on ouinion, since commercial men could now ascertain tbe views
of one of -he most eminent solicitors connected with the commercial praetice of the city of London. But, nstead of promoting a solution, it was only a signal for new perplexities. Instantly on its appearance it was met by a full reply from Mr. Lavie, a gentleman who, like Mr. Freshfield, occupies one of the highest positions as a commercinl authority in the metropolis, and who has for 30 years given especial attention to the state of the law in its bearing on analogons points. We have thus the whole matter brought to that peculiar degree of confusion unattainable except v;henlegal gentlemen are the expounding parties, and wvhich forms a chapter for merchants and financiers almost as instructive as the proceedings to secure speedy and economical relief for the unfortunate shareholders and depositors of the Royal British Bank.
The Clarendon (Jamaica) Mining Company have issued a report preparatory to their meeting on Friday. The last accounts from the mines are dated the 9th of January, and the lode, the approach to which has lately been impeded by hard ground, is expected soon to be reached, so as to enable its value to be determined. Meanwhile the appearance of its course is considered favourable. Since the last meeting only six tons of ore have been received, which have been sold at 161. Is. per ton. The expenditure of the year has been 6,0231., and the balanee now in hand is 7,8521.
The report of the Southampton Dock Company preparatory to their meeting on Wednesday shows an available balance of 8,3771. A dividend is therefore recommended at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum, which will leave a surplus of 1,1601. The gross earnings of the year have exceeded those of 1855 by 1,S73,1., but the expenses have also augmented.
The report of the Eastern Steam Navigation Company, to be presented to the meetingto-morrow, states that the total caUs made amountto 606,0191., on which 413,6421. has been received, leaving 192,3771. to be paid. With regard to the progress of the vessel, and the expectation of its being launched early in the ensuing summer, the directors remark:-
" The works were resuamed towards the ond of May last under the direction and control of the engineer and officers of the company, and have proceeded continuously, and the progress made in every department is such as not only to give the directors great satisfaction, but likewise to afford the expcctation that the ship may be launched early in the ensung summer. The progress of the works has left no alternative to the directors but to make calls with promptness and frequency. These calls have been more rapid than the directors could have wished, and they regret to add that the necessity for them has been increased by the failure on the part of some of the proprietors to meet their share of the burden. But the directors have felt it indispensable to the interests of all to complete the ahin, asthe only means of makting the outlay incurred profitable. Interest warrants for the year ending the 31st of December inst. have not been issued, the directors considering the policy of continu,ng to pay interest to bh a matter for the consideration of the meeting. The directors have to express their confident conviction that before the next half-yearly meeting the ship wrll be 1hunched asd the purposes of the company so far realized."
The prospectus has been issued of a life and pro. perty protection company, with a capital of 100,0001. in 21. shares. The object is to promote the general adoption of a newly-invemited alarum for indicating fire or attempts at housebreaking.
A correspondence between the Government and the Bank, just printed, shows the only advances on deficiency bils duinig, the year to have been 2,000,0001. in thesuarter e*lding the 31st of March. In the December quarter the Bank agreed to purchase at par 2,000,0001. out of the 4,000,0001. of Exchequer-bills authorized to be created last session, but the amount negotiated was ultimately limited to 1,000,0001.
A Parliamentary paper published to-day shows the bullion operations of the Bank during the past year. The amount of bar and foreign gold taken to them was 7,070,8311., while the sums withdrawn were 1,967,6301. of bar and foreign, and 5,632,2761. of British coin, making a total of 7,599,9061.
The weekly reviews from the Amsterdam and Rotterdam produce-markets state that business had been rather more animated, and that prices continued to be well s-upported. The operations in refined sugar had been at an advance, while coffee, tea, and indigo showed increased firmness. The letters from Rouen speak of a rather better demand for manufactures, but there was no alteration in rates.
AWith reference to the statement on Tuesday that sales of Clicago, St. Paul, and Fond du lac Railway bonds had been made at New York at 70j while they were being offered here at a much higher price, the London agent of that company questions the bond fide character of the sales, and adds that any bonds sold in New York must have been wvithout certain stock privileges which pertain to those disposed of in Europe. The quotation appeared in the leading New York papers as having been obtained at public auction.

PAUPERISM IN ENGLAND.-From a return issued
PAUPERISM IN ENGL&XID.-rronm a return issued on Monday, and referred to in a leading article of yesterday, it appears that (the total population of England and Wales in 1851 amounting to 17,J27,609 souls) there were in receipt of relief in 624 unions and parishes of England and Wales on Neow Year's-day last 843,430 paupers, against 87,605 on the Ist of January, 1856, makdng a net decrease of 33,225 in favour of the present year. The total number of adult ablebodied persons relieved, in and out of doors, 'was 139,130 on New Year's-day last, and 152,174 inJanuary, 1356, making a decrease of 13,044. The decrease of pau-
e6rism of alU ages is 3.8 per cent., and of adult pauperism b, e ent. There were 50,362 widows receiving out-door relief on the 1st of January, against 52,653 in 1856. The proportion of the number of II adult ablebodlied " reheved on the 1st of January last to the total number of "all classes" relieved is 16.5 per cent.

AN ITALIAN MURDER.-The Court of Assizes
ANr ITALIAN MUmRDER.-Tho Court of Assizes of Aix has just been occupied two days in trying a Sicilian named bfatraccia for murder and1 attempted murder. A Sicilan named Campisiano, a watbhmaker, had hved, with his wife and seven children, at Marseilles for many years, and was bighly respected by his neighbours. Some time ago a countryman named blatraccia, whom they had formerly known, arrived at Marseilles and renewved his acquaintance with them. This man, who followed the occupation of a rope dancer and mountebank, took advantage of his intimacy with the Campisianos to seduce the eJdest daughter, Lucretia, 21 years of age. She left her parents' house to follow him, but in December last returned home. It was then arranged th,t Matraccia should marry her, and he was received into the family en ettndat marriage. Bug Madame Campisiano, who was deeply hurt at her daughter's disgrace, was constantly quarrelling with Matraccia, and in these quarrels she was warmly supported by her second daughter, Diana. The consequence was that the man conceived a bitter animosity against both mother and daughter. On the 31st of December a more violent quarrel than theyhad previously had took place between the three, and Matraccia, in a furious stato of exasperation, declared that he would murder them. He then thrust a poniard into the fire, and kept it there until it was red hot; he then rulbbed it with garlic, and replaced it for a time in the fire. These operations in Sicily are supposed to give a poniard a higher temper, and inidicate on the part of the person performing them an intention to assassinate. On the 1st of January Matraccia and Lucretia spent some time togother at a publichouse, and then took a stroll on the public promenade. They there fell in with two other Italians, and Matraccia invited them to go to Campisiano's house to see theroom which he and his future wife were to occupy. In ascending the staircase to Campisiano's apartment they made a great noise, and when they reacbed tbe door Campisiano's son, a young man named Achilles, intimated that their visit was not agreeable either to his ents or to himself, and begged them to abstain from m git. Matraccia rephed in a passion, and a quarrel ensued. At length Matraccia, drawing a poniard, stabbed Achilles. The cries of the victim attracted his mother and his sister Diana to the spot, and they attempted to drag him away from his assailant, who was holding him and trying to stab him again. Turning on the two women with great fury, Matraccia poniarded them both, and laid both dead at his feet. He then rushed downstairs and took to ffight, but was pursued and arrested. The wounds of AchWiles, though dangerous, were fortunately not mortal. These facts were proved almost entirely by the Campisiano family, and as they gave their evidence scenes extraordinarily dramatic occurred :-Thus, when Lucretia, who seemed overwhelmed with grief, described the assassination of her mother and sister, the prisoner cried to her ia a rage, "You lio " On this the young woman turned to him, and with a look of scorn exclaimed, "Assassin of my mother ! assassin of my sister l dare you deny your crime ?" The man answered, " I am innocent and I appeal to Christ who is there (here he raised his hand towards a picture of the Crucifixion which was behind the judges); I appeal to Christ to testify my innocence !" This piece of blasphemy excited a murmur of indignation in the court. Canipisiano, the father, began his evidence with great calmness, but he gradually became excited, and whoa ho came to speak of his murdered wife and child he tore his hair, and gave way to violent despair. Ilis emotion at length became so great that he fainted, and was carried senseless from the court. At this painful spectacle most of the auditory wept, and Lucretia sobbed aloud. The young man Achilles could with the greatest dilficulty restrain his indignation against the prisoner, and the laster was furiously excited against hun, and more than once called him "Liar !" and "Impostor !" At length the passion of the witness exceeded all bunds, and he heaped imprecations on the prisoner. He also seized a chair and rushed to the dock to strike the prisoner vwith it, but was prevented, and he was forcibly removed from the court. Rosins, third daughter of Campisiano, who is only 12 years of age, described with remarkable intelligence the terriblo scene she had witnessed. When she had concluded she cried in a paroxysm of grief, "My poor dear mother ! I shall never see her again." The jury declared the man "Guilty." On this an Itahan, who had acted as interpreter, said to the pri.oner, " You are declared guilty, and will be condemned to death." Matraccia seemed thundenstrutc and trembled violently. The Court, after rebuking ithe interpreter for
his presumption in snaking auch an nnouncement, pronounced sentence of death in the suXalforns Thoprisoner. on hearing it, fell to the floor, ond Ts conveyed enselesa from the oourt.

LONDON, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1857.
In the House of Commons yesterday, on the order for going into committee upon the Judgments Execution Bill,
1Mr. H. HUGHES moved to defer the committee for six months, on the ground that the bill would injuriously affect the administration of justice and the principles of procedure in the courts of common law in Ireland.
Mtr. HADFIELD supported the bill, which was opposed by
Mr. WVIITSIDE, who contended that it would create greater evils than it remedied, and recommended that the whole subject of the execution of judgments should be left to the future department of justice.
The bill was opposed by Mr. BLAND, Colonel DU-N-E, Mr. M'CANN, and Mr. MI'MARON, and supported by Sir J. FITZGERALD and Mr. WVAsRItz,who thought there was no ground for apprehending that it would work injuriously for Ireland, and believed that its effects would be salutary for all parts of the kingdom.
Mr. NArIER commented upon the omissions in this bill compared with that of 1S55, whereby he said its mischiefs would be increased, and the remedy be worse than the disease. The Government, he thought, should take charge of a matter so important.
Mr. ROBBuCK likewise opposed the bill, which he characterized as a peddling measure. Legislation should begin by making the law upon the whole subject of judgments alike in aU parts of the kingdom.
TheLoRD- ADvoCATE, in supporting the biUl, urged the difficulties attendinig any attempt to assimilate the whole law of judgmnents in the three parts of the united kingdom. The time, however, he thouoht was come when effect might be given in all to a judgment obtained in either.
Mr. SPooxxR opposed the bill, the principle of which was defended by Mr. G. Bv.
Upon a division, the amendment was negatived by 127 to 80, and the 13ouse went into committee upon the bill. The chairmlan was, hovever, ordered to report progress, the committee to sit again that day week.
The House again went into committee upon the Chief Constabl(s Bill, the clauses of which were agreed to.
The Public Health Supplemental Bill was read a second time.
Sir J. PAKINGTON, in moving for leave to bring in a bill for the promotion of elementary education in cities and corporate towns, explained concisely the principles lupon which it was founded, and the circumstances under which he brought it forwardL The bill, he said, was so drawn that it did not contravene or reverse the decision of the House last year on the resolutions moved by Lord J. RlussuLL, which, as lie imderstood that decision, practicaUy expressed disapprobation of the plan, considered as a whole. The two important proyibions of that plan were that it sh=uld be com-
pulsory, and that it should be general. The bil he desired to introduce was in these respects exactly the reverse; it would be permissive and local. He confessed that, in his opinion, a compulsory would be far more beneficial than a permissive act; but, the sense of the House having been expressed against compulsory legislation, he thought he took a more cautious and respectful course by making the measure permissive only, for which there were precedents, and he confined it to cities and corporate towns because, their boundaries being defined, there would be no necessity for a special machinery. After adverting to a few facts proving the demand for a measure of this kind, he observed that, whether it was extensive or limited in its operation, it embodied principles the establishment of which he held to be of primary importancenamely, first, religious freedom and toleration; secondly, that there should be local contributions; and, thirdly, local management and control of the funds. A combination, so far at least as Manchester was concerned, had taken place between the religious and secular parties in this question, the basis of which was that the religious party consented that the rates should be extended to the beriefit of the secular schools, and the secalar party were willing that the rates should be extended to schools where religion was taught, on one condition, -that the money contributed by the ratepayers should not be directly applied to doctrinal teaching. Religious teaching would therefore be left upon its present footing, subject to the condition that children should not be compelled to learn creeds or catechisms to which their parents objected. The rate would be in aid of existing schools. Free schools might be established by the school committees, who might also admit a proportion of free scholars into the other schools. T'he framers of the bill, he added, were anxious to make it clear that there should be no interference with the management or control of the existing schools, except in cases where it was unavoidable. His belief was that if Parliament adopted the principles of his bill it would promote not only the intellectual, but the religious improvement of the people.
Mr. Cowpm said he did not think any person in the House would oppose the motion, which was entitled to full consideration as the result of a compromise between two parties hitherto hostile. He did not clearly understand the nature of the compromise, but it appeared to him that, with regard to the religious part of the question, the turningpoint would be whether schoolmasters of denominational schools were to be prohibited from giving doctrinal instructions to the children of their own denomination; and what was meant by doctrinal teaching ? He believed that moral duties could not be taught apart from doctrinal teaching. He admitted that a compulsory measure was impracticable, and that there were valid reasons for confining the operation of the bill to cities and towns.
Mr. E. BALL believed that the bill would be rather hurtful than beneficial.
Lord R. COCrL considered that this was an attempt to introduce the thin end of the wedge, which had so signally failed on former occasions. His objection to all these measures was, that the authors were in too great a hurry. The existing system had been in operation onlv four vears.
Mr. COBDEN said the objection of Lord R. CEOo
surprised him. It was more than 20 years since the question of education had been launched in that house. It was not contemplated, he observed, that the money raised by the Bill should be applied to religious teaching, but that parties in connexion with churches or chapels might set apart a time for religious teaching in the schools,-a plan already adopted. When the question came to a practical test it would be found that all the fears about the religious difficulty (or, as Mr. COBDEN afterwards explained himself, the difficulty of separating doctrinal from secular teaching) wrould prove a bugbear, if the matter were set about honestly and in earnest.
Mr. HmEvEY disagreed with Sir J. PANGToN as to the effect of the decision of last year; in his opinion, it expressed dislike of the principle of doing away with religious teaching, which should not be confined to certain hours of the day, but be spread over the whole teaching. This was the real difficulty. He suggested various objections to the swheme of the Bill, the result of which would be, he said, to give the money of the ratepayers to schools where no religion was taught; a Presbyterian schoolmaster, for example, was to be compelled to receive children who were to be taught no religion; and this was caUed " religious freedom." If our duty to God and man could only be taught through the intellect we had now arrived at the root of the difference. He affirmed that that duty could not be taught through the intellect alone.
Lord J. RUSSEuL approved the making this a permissive and local measure. He believed it to be the interest and duty of the country to make national education compulsory and general; but he was quite aware that, owing to the great difference of opinion in the country upon this point, such a plan could not be carried, and he was afraid that the prospect of carrying this measure was not very encouraging. According to this bill religious instruetion would be given as at present, except that the rate would not be directly or professedly for doctrinal instruction. This being so, it did not appear that Sir J. PARKiNGTON had made any dangerous concession to the secular party. Be believed that the school was the best place for religious instruction, and that the schoolmaster was a fit instructor; but if a rate was levied he did not think a particular kind of doctrinal instruction should be given in the schools. He heartily wished suecess to the measure.
After some remarks by hlr. HADFIELD and Mr. W. EWART, and a reply by Sir J. PAKIrNGTON, leave was given to bring in the bill.
Mr. WIIITESIDE moved for certain returns respecting the removal of Baron RIcHARDs from the Encumbered Estates Court in Ireland; but, Mr. HoBsirAN being stopped in his reply, the debate was adjourned.
Mr. GLADSTONE gave notice of a motion concern lng the proposed Customs duties.
The House adjourned at a few minutes before 6 o'clock.
There is no good reason why a monopoly of
There is no good reason why a monopoly of the trade of Demagogues should be left to Mr. ERNEST JONES and his partners in discord. In the few remarks, then, we are about to offer to our fellow-countrymen of the working classes-although we by no means admit that, under ordinary circumstances, the burden of life weighs more heavily upon their shoulders than our own-we shaU endeavour to be as precise in meaning and as clear in expression as possible. As we cannot personally address the knots of artisans and workmen who have lately gathered together in Smithfield, nor go back with them to their humble homes to talk matters over, we must do the best we can with pen and ink. To clear the ground before we come to the discussion of their exact position, of the causes which have produced it, and of the means which may be employed to better it, we would earnestly implore them to dismiss from their minds the absurd assertions which are made by professional agitators, to the effect that the rich disregard the sufferings of the poor. The statement is absolutely untrue. With very rare exceptions indeed, all persons in this country who have attained a position which enables them to command the comforts and some of the luxuries of life ask no better than to be of real service to their struggling fellow-countrymen. If the rich are so hard-hearted, who has founded all the hospitals and chariteble institutions? Who bears the greater share of the expense for schools in England and Wales? How is it that when a well-ascertained case of destitution and misery is reported in the newspapers, before 48 hours have elapsed money enough is thrown in by anonymous hands most effectually to relieve the sufferers ? What took place at the time of the Irish famine? What when the sad news of the inundations in France reached this country ? Can it be supposed by any except those who have a direct interest in misrepresenting the truth thatEnglishmen are not readyto do more for their own suffering countrymen than they did for the unfortunate peasaints and artisans of a strange land? If a national subscription were a fitting method for easing the burden whirl', no doubt, presses at the present moment too si-rply upon the shoulders of some among our country-
men, before a week were out almost any sum of money might be obtained; but it is felt that this would do no good, and for reasons whinh we will presently mention. All that we say just now is that the wish to assist the poor in any reasonable manner-that is, in any manner which wiU enable them to assist themselves in the long runis most sincere and universal among 99 per cent. of all Englishmen who live in comfortable houses or who wear decent coats upon their backs.
Now, first about the fact and the extent of the distress now existing. We believe the amount of it has been exaggerated. We had occasion yesterday to look into the Poor Law returns just published, and we found that on the 1st of January, 1857, there were in aU but 843,340 persons in England and Wales receiving public relief as against 876,655 persons in the same condition on the 1st of January, 1850. Of grownup persons of both sexes receiving relief there were but 139,130 in 1857 as against 152,174 in 1856. We do not say this is conclusive, for there is a great deal of sad struggling on the edge of destitution before people let themselves go; but at least the figures which represent the numbers receiving relief give an idea of the numbers who are moving beaven and earth that they may not have to ask it. What is true of 1857 was true of 1856, and therefore we are justified in concluding that there actually is less distress in England and Wales at the present moment than there was at the corresponding period last year. Again, we must make, we much fear, very considerable deductions for the drunkards, the dissolute, the slothful, the imprudent, the il-conditioned-for all those persons, in short, who, had they been born in the lap of wealth and plenty, would in a few years' time have brought th6inselves to ruin. WVe will speak presently of laws, and of the restraints imposed by laws; but for the moment we would ask of all the artisans and workmen now out of employ to put this question to themselves,-" How much of "our own fault lies at the heart of this matter? "Have we always done our best to find a day's "work, and our best to do it when found? Have "we cast about with a provident eye to watch the "shiftings of trade, so that when changes came, "inseparable from the course of trade, we might "not be found unprepared? Have we, when in "receipt of good wages, dealt to our utmost "with the savings-banks, and tried to make "provision for a rainy day?" Many persons now destitute will no doubt be able honestly to answer " Yes" to these questions. Their case is worthy of all commiseration, and themselves of aU help which one man can afford to another. Manv
persons, however, if they answer honestly, mnst answer "No !" With respect to them we are not about to play the part of JoB's friends, and to tell them thaz, as they have made their beds, so must they lie upon them. We would only say that, since conscience tells them they are not altogether blameless themselves, let them at least first mend what is amiss in their own conduct before they fall foul of the social conditions of the society in which they live.
Thus, then, stands the case-although there is less distress in England than there was this time last year, and although a considerable amount of the distress actually existing is fairly to be put down to the account of the sufferers, still enough remains to entitle the subject to the most earnest consideration of the public. We have spoken of the extent of the misery, but whence does it arise? How is it to be remedied? Mr. ERwEST JONDS, tells us that it arises mainly from derangements in the building trade, in the iron trade, and in the cotton trade. " The suspension of the build" i;g trade depends upon the operation of the "national debt, which enriches the few and im"poverishes the many. Those who live by usury, "having suddenly become rich, must have fine "boxes and splendid villas in the suburbs. This " system, however, has been worked out, and so "there is an end of the building." Just so; the evil has worked its own cure upon the orator's own showing, although how the smaU rate of interest paid upon stock entitles the receivers of dividends to the name of "usurers" we do not quite see. MIr. E. JoNs seems, too, to shut his eyes to the fact that the number of persons receiving 2001. per annum and upwards from the pubho funds is extremely limited in amount. The same kind of arguments are used with regard to the iron and cotton trades, but as they are of the same class we need not touch upon them here. What MIr. E. Jo3Es, however, did not say was, that the distress now existing depends upon any law or laws now in the statute-book, and herein his address the other day at Smithfield differs favourably from similar addresses made by his predecessors in agitation. As long as there were laws wlich imposed restrictions upon the free importation of food or upon the free play of labour, a demagogue might make out a case, but now no such attempt is made. We take note of the fact, and earnestly call the attention of the distressed artisans to this point-that their distress depends upon causes over which the lawmakers have no control. It would not, moreover, do them any good, but, on the contrary, the most deadly injury, if the more opulent classes were to-morraw to leave off wearing good clothes, living in good houses, using good furniture, and purchasing good food for their domestic consumption. The only result of this would be, that where one artisan is wretched now a hundred would be in the like case.
The present distress, then, does not depend upon want of sympathy with the poor upon the part of the rich, nor does it depend upon any law or laws now in existence. It is the result of the derangement of trade, and trade,-in other words, the demand for labour, will ever be subject to derangement. One year we shall require more hands to build houses, another year to make railroads ; another to spin cotton; another to man ships. To a certain limited extent MIr. E. JoNEs speaks the truth on this matter as to causes, but the remedy he proposes is the most preposterous that ever crossed the imagination of man. Out of the unemployed he would call into existence 1,000,000 independent farmers by settling them on the waste lards. Now, we presume that every man among the struggling artisans who is the least versed in agricultural matters will readily understand that the landlords who own the soil have already brought the pick of the land under cultivation. Wherever they thought a profit could be made they have made it. Landlords are not so blind to their own interests an to leave good land waste. Well, ften, Mr. JoxNS would settle the people on the lands which. in the opinion of the owners will not pay tl'e expenses of cultivation-in other words, on lands where to gain 51. you must spend 101. Is there reason in this? Would it do aniy good to a poor struggling mechanic if he were taken to-morrow to the midst of Salisbury Plain, and told to " Fall to and
' dig away ? We, at least, have never insulted the misery of the poor by pointiug to such a remedy for the ills under which they are suffering. Besides, the thing has been tried a score of times in the shape of land schemes and what not, and invariably the operation has resulted in a signal failure and in an increase of tribulation. Half-a-dozen patriots get good salaries, and half-adozen attorneys get good fees for a year or two, and then-the end. It is much the same thing with regard to a national subscription. It is now perfectly well understood that but a very small
proportion of the benefits intended would ever reach the really honest and deserving; the rogues *nd brawlers, as usual, would get the lion'a share of the plunder. Besides this, a subscription is but a transitory remedy, to be applied to a transitory and fortuitous evil. Let a village be burnt down or swept away by an inundation, and you may by a gift of money assist a sufferer to regain his footing; but it is more than probable that a sum of money similarly given to a man who is contending with the ordinary calamities of life will only defer the strugale through which he must eventually pass, and in which he must eventuaUy conquerfor a brief period of time. It may, however, in fairness be asked, since we reject the remedies of others, what have we to propose ourselves ? Our answer is, that 14 days off in point of time and 6G. off in point of expense-taking Toronto as the terminus-lies a country inhabited by British people, fertile, healthy, unoccupied; a country in which any man who can use his arms to dig the ground, to build a wall, to glaze a window, to rub down a horse, to make a pair of shoes or a coat, is sure of wages which will support him in comfort and decency. We do not say that it is possible, or that it would be wise if it were possible, to take 1,000,000 of people and throw them broadcast upon the surface of the Canadas in one sweep ; but no doubt that vast province is capable of absorbing. the surplus of our population with great rapidity. If tle present distress lasts, and there appears no prospect of improvemert, let one member of a fanily give the thing a trial and pioneer the way. When he has obtained a firm footing, wife, children, father, mother, sisters may follow. This way of escape from the evils of an overcrowded country is at least open to any respectable artisan and his family. Those who choose to remain behind must remember that if they cling to the great advantages of an old country they must also accept its drawbacks. Not long since we told the farmers and the shipowners they must look about them if they hoped to hold their own in the presence of a world at work. We say the same thing now to the British artisan or mechanic; he must be at least as good a man as his father if he hopes to live as well and bring up a family here. In any case, whether he chooses to stop or go, let him avoid political agitation as he would the plague. If we sow the wind the whirlwind is the crop, and only Mr. FROST or Mr. JONES will say that suchi a crop pays for cultivation.
We cannot profess any regret that Mr. MUNTZ
We cannot profess any regret that Mr. MuNTrz has seen fit to postpone his motion on the Incometax, annotnced for Tuesday last. Its principles were unimpeachable, but its opportuneness was very quesiionable. Ve are now, in fact, precisely in the same position with respect to the Income-tax as when it was originally imposed, in 1842. The assessment of the tax is certainly unfair, its incidence on two great divisions of contributors is palpably unequal,'and it can never be levied on such principles without very reasonable discontent. All this is perfectly true, but it is also true, we trust, that the tax itself as an ordinary part of our financial machinery is marked for removal; and it can hardly be worth while, therefore, to elaborate for the last three years out of a term of 18 an improvement which we have been fain to dispense with for the 15 years preceding.
Having admitted, however, thus much, we cannot forbear remarking that the third of the resolutions which Mr. MUNTZ placed on the list of notices does really comprise the truth and essence of the whole case which has now been produced so repeatedly for the judgment of the public. It runs in these plain words:" That to defer the application of a practical " remedy under the pretence that it would not be " a perfect one, applicable to every individual " case, is, in truth, only to add insult to in" justice." Here, in fact, lies the fallacy of the objections which have been raised against schemes of amendment. It has been urged that no distribution or classification of the rateable capacities of individuals will satisfy rigorous justice, or do otherwise thanleave many examples ofgrievousand incontestable hardship. Granted; but what'excuse is this for perpetuating a system in which the injustice reaches its max-imnum, and where the examples of hardship must inevitably be more numerous than under any plan, however imperfect, in which an earnest attempt at remedy was made? The error consists in the apparent assumption that unfairness ceases to be unfairness, or at all events is felt in some manner as less oppressive, when it is extended comprehensively and without exceptions over an enormous class; or, in other words, that the mere absence of all attempt at discrimination has the effect of rendering the results more tolerable and defensible than would be the. case if discrimination were imperfectly applied. It seems, in sbort, to be conceived that cases of hardship, such as could not fail to remain under the scheme of variable rating, would then become something worse and more serious than they are at present, as if a practical effort to remove injustice in as many instances as possible would leave it more unendurable than before in those where it was beyond reach of removal, and as if an approximation merely to equality was worse than inequality altogether untouched. To these conclusions we resolutely demur. That no person has ever yet framed, and perhaps never could frame, a detailed system of rating, under which every single contributor should pay exactly a just proportion of his means and no more, is very likely an indisputable proposition; but this is no valid argument aainlst the construction of a system in which classification and adjustment shal be carried as far as they can go. No doubt, there may be some descriptions of propei Ly so unreal, and some descriptions of income so assured, that the taxable substance of the latter may exceed, upon an impartial estimate, that of the former; but can these examples ever be frequent or considerable enough to affect the broad distinction eternally subsisting between the two kinds of possessions ? No doubt, a varying rate of assessment, however carefully framed, would leave plenty of grievances behind, but those grievances could not possibly be so numerous as under the uniform rate, where, as a general result, all persons paying upon property are contributing too little, and all persons paying upon income are contributing too much. How, we ask, once for all, can any scheme attempting a discrimination between property and income be so imperfect as one which leaves them writhout any discrimination whatever?
At the same time, however, that we consider the revival of this question to be now inopportune, we are bound to acknowledge that this very argument is one of the rocks on which all ,attempted reformus have split. When complaints like these have been uttered we have been told that the tax is but temporary, and when the tax with its an.malies has been accepted as temporary it is brou"ht forward for rerewal. "WNhat is the use," sa: l Mr. GLADSTONE the other night, " of voting a perpetual Income-tax because "you thinxk the rate should be varying, alnd then "all your life long finding that you are supporting "a uniforrm rato 1" What, indeed ! Yet this is a pretty accurate description of what we have been doing for some years past. We have neither teimiinated the tax nor modified it-neither varied the rate of assessment according to the wi6hes of one party, nor abolished the whole impost according to thQ desires of another, and so
the end of it has been an unequal system of taxation, and eighteen years of the burden instead of three.
One thing, therefore, is clear-that either the rate ought to be varying, or the tax ought to be terminable; and of these alternatives we have no hesitation, under the present eireumstances, in preferring the latter. Let us pay the uniform rate, but not find ouraelves doing so " all our lives long." We do not admit the absolate impracticability of adjusting the tax more fairly to the various means of the contributors. To construct & scheme meeting all cases and shades of cases with infallible equity may be beyond the power of financiers, but the question is not of attaining perfection, but of attaining something nearer perfection than has actually existed. ThDe better prospect just now, however, is the extinction of the duty till a special emergency may return. That prospect, at any rate, is placed clearly before us, nor do we object, on this assumption, to the retention of the 2d. in the pound which the arrears of the war and the requirements of Current finance may render desirable. WVhat we now look to is the disappearance of the impoat in 1860. That, and not the gradual diminution of the tax, was the true essence of Mr. GLADSTONa'S proposals. It was the finality comprised in the scheme of 1853 which rendered it so comprehensive and so acceptable, and if this result is stitY4ecured, despite the perturbations occasioned by a great war, we do not think the conclusion need be complained of. We are to pay 7d. in the pound in the place of 5d., and we are to pay this upon a uniform instead of a varying rate-that is to say, during the next three years 6,000,0001. morethan was proposed in 1853 will be levied indiscriminately, as before, from the property and income of the country. This we think ought to satisfy the Edvocates of direct taxation. On the other hand, in the year 1860-36 months hence-the Incometax, with all its inequalities and anomalies, is fairly to expire. Will not this reflection content Mr. MU.NTz? We really think it miglht, but we faithfully promise hini that if the tax is proposed for renewal we shall be ready to fight the battle of justice by his side, and to contend with him for the best discrimination between substantial property and precarious income which the genius of our atatesmen shall be able to denise.
"There are no misfortunes which cost us so
" There are no misfortunes which cost us so " much pain as those which never happen." So says the proverb, and the trith of it is seldom better exemplified than in matters which concern the safety and wellbeing of the State. Let any reader, after recalling what we yesterday observed about the decrease of pauperism in this country, just cast a retrcspect for a single minute on the alarniing prophecies which were uttered not many years ago respecting the increase of population in these islands. It was proved by the combined force of algebra and logic that we were doomed to utter ruin, and what made the prospect worse was that there was really no visible way of escaping from the conclusion. The surrounding ocean which circumscribes our shores, however it might be bridged for other purposes, presented an impassable barrier at any rate to territorial expansion. The extent of soil, cultivation, and occupation being thus limited, it became easy to prove that no rate of increase could be established or maintained in the productiors of the earth which should equal the natural and actual increase in the numbers of its inhabitants ; and, as all the facts therefore were manifest and the consequence beyond dispute, what was to become of us ? The practical reply has been given in the event. We have gone on without having been overtaken or menaced by any of the calamities foretold; indeed, we lhave even incurmed some alleged danger of the very opposite description, and have occasionally been warned that the hardy progeny of our forefathers was threatened with decay. Into the circumstances which may hove operated to bring aboul this result we shall not attempt to enter, but confine our moral to the single remark that, as the most learned of human speculations must still leave the wisdom of PRoVInDxcN unfatlhomed, we need never be anxious overmuch about calculations from which the most powerful element of the whole account has been necessarily omitted.
In connexion, however, with the Poor Las returns which have furnished the statistics referred to, we find a subject inviting special consideration, and admitting, we think, of some good practical conclusions. MIr. MlThNE1i GIBSOX obtained last year a return exhibiting, in a comprehensive and tabular form, the precise extent to which the benefits of education were applied in the case of pauper children. In this document were set forth the number of children chargeable to the poorrates in England and Wales, but not inmates of workhouses or of special schools for pauper children, who on a given day in the year were attending dayschools at the cost either of their own parents or relatives, or of other parties, or of the poor-rates, together with the numbers of such as were at the Eanie period in work, or not attending any dayschool. It will not be necessary for our present purpose to enter minutely into the classifications and distributions firnished by the return. All the preliminary information we wish to convey will be comprised in the general totals assumed by the figures. NVe presume that the number of children represented as not in attendance at any dayschool includes those afterwards specified apart as being in work at the period in question, and it should be premised that from 87 unions, &c., the required returns were not forthcoming; but with these qualifications the results before us show that of a gross total of 154,520 children between 3 and 15 years of age, as many as 102,086 were receiving instruction at dayschools under some one or other of the conditions above enumerated. Now, the point we desire to press upon- the attention of the authorities and the public is this,-that these figures represent a class of the population of an age peculiarly amenable to instruction, and so circunistanced as to be open to that instruction under almost exactly such forms as may be thought most desirable.
At the time wlhen the separation of man and wife under the New Poor Law was exciting very natural complaint, we remember an indignant censor exclaiming that people seemed to wish to " breed " hereditary paupers in theveryworkhouse itself." We should like to apply the form and language of this ejaculation to the question of pauper education, and tourge upon all thoseinauthoritythe expediency of insuring that, as far as training and instruction can fit a child for self-maintenance, the descendants of those receiving parochial relief may never inherit the necessity of such dependence themselves. Here, at all events, theorists of aU sorts may find a common groiund of action, for no principle of creed or conformity can be touched by t4e simple provision for a training in common tAlks. How common these things are may be learnt from a remnark made in the last letter published from our correspondent in Australia, who, in criticizing the qnalifications of the emigrants airiving in those parts observes : " The women servants are so ignorant of the
minor decencies of life in the way of clothing, cleanliniess, cookery, and domestic economy that "they seem to me to be almost unfit for the
grand offices, w)ich they are nearly sure to accept, of wife and mother." It is almost im-
possible to exaggerate such defects as those portrayed in this short sentence. Clothing, cleanliness, cookery, and domestic economy known so little of that the ordinary decencies of daily life ca3 L5carcely be preserved ! lVhat a picture of women -who must, we presume, in the majority of cases, 4lave received either in dayschools, pauper schools, -or schools of Bsome kind an amouint of training -conceived to convey at any rate the rudiments of
lecessary edlucation ! Yet which of these things can be hard to teach ? If cleanliness, as the old Laying tells us, is next to godliness, it is surely -well worth imparting. Of the other points 'pecified, look not only at their intrinsic importonce in ministering to content and happiness, but -at the direct value of such things in economizing the means of any establishment. Competence in ,cookery means a saving of half the material employed; competence in mending or making clothes -means nearly as much; and competence in domestic management rarely means less than the prosperity *of the entire household. Take a girl well trained in these matters-and surely they should come naturally enough to the instinctive aptitudes of a woman-what would be her worthl? We do not think any one will charge us with exaggeration if -we Bay that when such a woman becomes a wife -there is very little probability that any of the iamily will be paupers.
But hy, we shaU be asked, necd we fix upon Taupseducation in particular as the agent in the production of such advantageous results? Why -not apply it to all training of such classes, how-ever conducted ? Certainly our remarks are applicable to every school frequented by every class; nor have we the least desire to circumscribe -their scope ; but the instruction of paupers both zuggests and facilitates the objects we have in view. It suggests them, because we can hardly help reflecting that the walnt of such training in their parents may, in many cases, have been materially dnstrumental in causing their actual dependence ; it facilitates them, because this very dependence invests their instructors or guardians with more than ordinary power. The education which we give gratuitously can be regulated as ve please
nor would it be a small matter to the country at large if a certain number of children well -rained in the knowledge of common things -were sent out year by year from certain -schools to leaven the contemporary population. If there is anything like a standing aggregate of I 00,000 children between 3 and 1v whose education is under control, the instr-tumenit in our banids for good is a very powerful one indeed. Our -object should be not merely to support paupers as -cheaply as possible, but to prevent pauperism -as surely as we can; and we see no means more -likely to lead to this end than the conveyance of ouch instruction as may render the dependence of every pauper terminable with his own generation.

The Late Earl Of Ellesmere, K.G.
THE LATE EARL OF RLLESMRR, E.G.
The death of the Earl of Ellesmere, which occurred at Bridgewater-house yesterday after a very longand moat painful illness, requires at our hands something more than a mere passing paragraph. Francis Egerton, first Earl of Ellesmere, of Ellesmere, county of Salop, and Viscount Brackley, of Brackley, county of Northampton, was born on the 1st day of January, 1800. His father was George Granville, Marquis of Stafford, who afterwards was raised to the highest degree in the British Peerage, as Duke of Sutherland, whose father, the preceding Marquis, had married Louisa, daughter and eventualy coheir of Scroope, first Duke of Bridgewater, to whose magnificent estates the Earl just deceased succeeded at the decease of his father in 1833, when he assumed the surnwime and arms of Egerton alone in the place of his patronymic of Leveson Gower. He received his early education at Eton, whence he was in due time transferred to Christ Church, Oxford, *where he graduated 13.A. in 1821. In the following year Lord Francis Leveson Gower, as he was then styled, was returned to Parliament as member for the pocket borough of Bletchingley, and commenced his public career in the Commons aa a Liberal Conservative, and a warm supporter of Mr. Canning and his party. He had, however, at an earlier date displayed a taste for literature and the fine arts; and long before he had risked the broad glare of publication he had printed for private circulation some poems which were at least respectable. He then published a translation of Faust, accompanied by free and spirited versions of popuIlar lyrics selected from the works of Goethe,
Schiller, Burger, Salis, and K6rner, which passed through several editions before he resolved to withdraw it from further circulation.
In 1828 Lord Francis Leveson Gower was sworn a member of His Majesty's Privy Council, and not long afterwards accompanied the late Marquis of Anglesey to Ireland as Chief Secretary. From July to November, i830, he held the office of Secretary-at-War under the latter parb of the Ministry of the Duk;e of WVellington. From 1826 to the dissolution in 1834 he sat for the county of Sutherland. In the December of the latter year he was chosen for the Soithern Division of Lancashiro, whichhe continued to represent down tohis elevation to the Peerage, in 1846. On most important questions he carefully abstained from identifying himself with any faction or party. We ought, however, to mention that 20 years before Sir Robert Peel adopted the policy of free trade that measrre had been strenuously advocated by Lord Francis Egerton in his place in Parliament; that he warrmly supported the project of establishing the University of London; and that he actually carried on one occasion a motion for the endowmnewt of the Roman Catholic clergy in Ireland.
In the year 1839 his Lordship was recommended by his hmedical advisers to spend a winter in the East, and he accordingly proceeded in his own 3 acht to the Mediterranean and the Holy Land. The results of his observations he afterwards gave to the world in the form of no'es to his poem entitled the Pilg'image, in which, having adopted the staff and sandals oi a palmer, he gave a highly pIetical picture of the various scenes and places which he visited in the course of his tour. This vclume has been since reprinted, but it has been withheld from further circulation fnr many veera
In the few years previous and sabsequent to this date Lord Ellesmere published his Mediterranean SI.etches, and printed for private circulation several poems, among which the best known are Donna (1,aritea; Ble Beard, a Parody; the Siege of
'ienena, and the Pa'ia ; together -with The Mill, and a Monzody On1 the Death of the Duk1e of Wel-
Lord Elleesmere had inherited the magnificent pictures collected by the great Duke of Bridgewater, and set a brilliant example to the possessors of similar collections by erecting a noble gallery at his town residence in Cleveland-gardens, to which the public have found ready admission.
Like most Ducal houses, the House of Sutherland is built of a series of successive stages, and part at least of its fortunes may be said to have commenced from a comparatively humble origin. Thomas Egerton, the illegitimate son of Sir Ralph Egerton, of Ridley, having been brought up to the bar, arrived at the highest honours of his profession, and filled during the reign of Elizabeth the posts of Solicitor and Attorney General, Master of the Rolls, and Lord Keeper of the Great Seal. On the accession of King Jazes Sir Thomsas Egerton -was appointed Lor'd High Ohancellor of England, and was raised to the Peerage as Baron of Ellesmere* a few years later he -was advanced to the Visconntcy of Brackley. An Earldom had been already promised to him, when he died; strange to say, the King, though a Stuart, kept his word, and elevated his son and succeor to the Earl
dom of B3ridgewater. Not content with this mark of Royal favour, he appointed him Lord President of Wales, and of the Marches thereof, and it is to this appointment that the world of letters is indebted for Milton's immortal masque of Comus. His great-,randson Scroope, fourth Earl, who was created Duke of Bridgewater in 1720, left two sons, who successively inherited the Dukedom, and an only danghter, Louisa, grandmother, as we have already said, to the Peer so lately deceased. The third and last Dake of Bridgewater was the projector of the celebrated canal which still bears his name, and -which realized a princely fortune for himself and his successors. The Dukedom becamne extinct on his death, in 1803, though the Earldom of Bridgewater continued for some 25 years longer in a distant branch of the family; and the magnificent property of thet house was devised by his Grace to his nephew, Geor,ge Granville, second Marquis of Stafford and first Duke of Sutherland, with remainder to his second son, who, as our readers are aware, has been successively known as Lord Francis Leveson Gower, Lord Francis Egerton, and Earl of Ellesmere.
It only remains for us to add that the nobleman who has so recently passed away from among us married in 1822 Harriet Catherine, eldest daughter of Mr. Charles GrevMle and granddaughter of the late Duke of Portland, by whom he had issue two daughters, of whom the elder is married to the Hon. G. 0. H. Byng, grandson of Field-Marshal the Earl of Strafford; and alzo five sons, the youngest of whom, Granville, was killed on the 27th of January, 1851, by a musket shot received accidentally at target practice on board one of Her Majesty's ships of the line. Of the other sons one is a captain in the navy, and another holds a captain's commission in the Grenadier Gaards. His Lordship's eldest son, George Grauville Francis, Viscount Brackley, who has now succeeded to the Peerage as second Earl of Ellesmere, was born in 1823, and married in 1846 the Lady Mary Louisa Campbell, daughter of the Earl of Cawdor, by whomn he has two children, Charles Granville, born in 1847, and another son, horn in 1854. His Lordship was elected for the Northern Division of Staffordshire at the general election of 1847, but accepted the Chiltern Hlundreds in February, 1851, on the ground of ill health.
The deceased Earl was a Knight of the Order of the Garter, Lieutenant. Colonel of the Lancashire Yeomanry, a Deputy-Lieutenant for the cotmty of Sutherland, a Vice-President of the Literary Fund, one of the Council of King's College, London, and a Trustee of the National Gallery. He was also appointed Lord-Lieutenant and Custos Itotulorurm of the County Palatine of Lancaster on the death of the late Earl of Sefton, in 1855.

The difflcutmes with which the coinnissioners have had to contend in providing for the most urgent demands on their Stt ds are likely to be much increased this year owing to a serious defalcation in their funds from the non-receipt of a largfc portion of the moneys which should have been levied by the collector of rates in thle city of Dublin, and the respective boards of guardians and other bodies for the paywlent of ministers' money, the amount received by the comnnic.iorners baving been only 4,9391., while they paid away 1:. 3691., making the sum total paid on this accountsince the Pct of 1854 21.3001.

The Walworth Murders.
TEB WALWORTH MURDEBS.
Yesterday morning the prisoner Thomas FuLer Bacon and Martha Bacon, his wife, were brought from Horsemonger-lane Gaol to the Lambeth police court, the former tn «he prison , and the Latter in a cab under the care of Mr. Cook, the gaoler, to await their further examination.
The male prisoner was first brought into court, and led to the felons' ock, where he seated himself at the far end; and the woman, as on her former examinationswas pernitted a seat at the solicitors' table, where she was surrounded ls several female friends. The male pri oner seemed exceewingly downcast, and kept his eyes fixed on the floor of the dock, as if to avoid seeing any one, but, as if suddenly recollecting himself, he stood up and kept staring for some moments in the direction in wbich his v'ife sat, in the hope of getting a sight of her; but her back being turned, and a high partition behind her, he did not succeed. At this mnoment, and when the examination was about to be proceeded with, Mr.'~Atter, the iprisoners attorney, received from the Waterloo station the following telegraphic communication, forwarded from Stamford inminediately after Dr. Taylor had made the disclosure before the coroner and jury at Great Casterton that morning:-" Arsenic is found by Dr. Taylor." On reading the document Mr. Atter left his seat, approached the dock, and had some private communication with his client, and related to him the fact of the message. The intelligence had some effect upon Bacon, but by no means such an impression as might have been expected; but this may be accounted for by the fact of his expecting it, as he had been informed that the body of his mother had been exhumed for the purpomes of examination.
The telegraphic message was handed to the chief-clerk, who placed it before the magistrate.
Mr. EnLLorr, after reading it, addressing Inspector Young, asked if he bad any more evidence to offer against the prisoners, and Mr. Young replied that he had not.
Mr. ELLIoTr next asked the professional gentlemen engaged in the case if they had anything to offer to the Court, and both answered in the negative.
Mr. ELLIo'rr then said,-After carefully considering this case, and giving all the circumstances my best consideration, I have come to the determination of sending both the prisoners to talke their trial on this very serious char e. On that trial a question will arise respecting the state of mind of the woman, nIrs. Bacon, and it will be the province of the jury to pronounce an opinion upon it. I may also men. timn that poison has been found in the body of Ms. Bacon, sen., and that about the time of her death her son, the male prisoner, had been in possession of and dealing with a similar poison.
This annonncement created an evident sensation throughout the crowded court, and all eyes were fixed on the male prisoner. but, beyond keeping his eyes fixed on the floor and exhibiting a slight flush on the countenance, he did not betray any particular eniotion.
Mr. ELLIOTT.-I feel it also to be my duty to state that in the course of this investigation I received a letter signed '" A." disclosing circumstances of a peculiar character indirectly conneoted with the case; and, though it is anonymous, the writer expresses his willingness, should I desire it, to come forward and verify the important statements it contains. As these statements are of an important public character, it is my wish that the writer should come forward, and it will be my desire, as well as my duty, to hear all he has to say respecting the important matters contained in his letter. n conclusion, I feel bound to say that Mr. Young, the officer engaged in this case, has done himself much credit by the intelligence and activity he has displayed, and the manner in which he has sought out and brought forward zle large and important mass of evidence, and I have no hb sitation in saying that the public are much indebted to him. I have only now to remand the prisoners to a future day, when you, Mr. Young, will have the whole of the witnesses in attendance, that the evidence given by each may be read over to them, and that they may sign their depositions.
The prisoners were here removed from the court, and on Bacon reaching his cell his fortitude completely forsook him. He instantly flung himself on the seat, trembled and shook from head to foot, and commenced cry'ng and wailing in the most piteous tones. Some of his friends were adiudtted to him, and one or two of themn recommended him to make a clean breast of it and disclose all he knew, and for some time it was thought he 'would do so. He, however, recovered his self-possession, and expressed a strong desire to see and speak with his wife. He begged the gaoler to allow him the interview he sought, but that officer told him he could not do so withotLt the magis trate's sanction. Bacon then said he should first write a noteforhher, and then ask the magistrate for an interview, and, if that was refused, for permission to send her the note he should write. A pen, ink, and paper were then given to him, and in the presence of Cook and Inspector Young he wrote a note, of which the following is a literal copy.-
Lty dear blartha,--I write these 4aw lines to you hopinz thatyon v,i sell me the truith as I wish to the Lord that you wil speak the trith as itwvllh bjesst Sor us as onr situation requires Now we are place th.t notbins else wiu be more Advantageous to both hoDing yon as my wtife ill not but site mne anwer as i should like to see'you and fiiewise to speak to you hoping you are weU so now more this time with my love to you.

"T. F. BACO N.7
Bacon hero, at his request, was taken before the magistrate, and, addressing llr. Elliott, said,-Might I take the liberty of asking to be allowed to see my wife72
3Mr. ELLIOTT.-I cannot allow you to do so.
Bacon.-Then may I communicate with her by letter ?
Mlr. ELLIOT.-At present I CaDnnOt allowv you to have any conmmuncation with her,
The prisoner wan then led out of court,
THE ADJOURNED INQUEST AT STAMFORD.
The inquiry iAito the death of Ann Bacon, the mother of the prisoner on the other charge, was resumed yesterday at Great Casterton, near Stamford, before Mr. Hough, coroner for the county of Rutland. The remains of the deceased were exhumed on the 6th inst., in order that the viscera might be submitted to chymical analysis by Professor Taylor, strong suspicions being entertained taat the poor woman was poisoned by her son, Thomas Fuller Bac' n.
M1ark Wilson Jackson, surgeon, Stamford, was the fist witness examined. He deposed,-I made a post mortent examination of the deceased. Onr opening the body the abdominal parietes were found to be unusually thick; they con. sisted of layers of fat and muscle (of a reddish colour), varying from half an inch to twvo inches in thickness. On raising the parietes the omentum, or caul, was exposed, on which a peculiar redness was apparent. The stomach and liver appeared in their proper positions. On removing the omentum the bowels were seen; they appeared dry, empty, somewhat inflated, corrugated like dry bladder, a patch of redness here and there. The mesentery was loaded with fat; the colon and stomach appeared thickened. The stomach was of a dark reddish colour, and much re. duced in size. The liver was smal in size; the gaU bladder was full; the whole of the viscera of the abdomen were in a high state of preservation, and presented a peculiar appearance. Such a condition would not be produced by any disease; the appearance was like that which Dr. ChriAtlsn and other analytical chymists describe as being from tho effects of arsenic. If Dr. Taylor should find arsenic it certainly will be a strong proof of the highly prese'rvative effects of arsenic, and also show that bodies consigned to the tomb poisoned by the action of this pernicious drug will for years retain the appearances peculiar to its specific action as a preservative.
Professor Taylor then presented his report, which was as
follows:-
REpo'RT oF ANALYSIS IN THE CASE OF MRs. Ass
BAiCON.
"The box delivered to me by Chief Constable itchelU contained.-
" L A bottle holding a quantity of bloody liquid taken from the chesc of the eeceased.
" 2. A large jar containing the viscera.
"3. A brown paper parcel containing mould from the grave of the deceased.
"- Articles l and 2 were in the state in which I had delivered them to Mr. Mlitchell-namelv, well secured and sealed with my seals, which were unbroken.
" 1. CONTF:STS OF THE BOTTLE.
"The liquid was of a reddish brown colour, and measured seven fluid ounces.
" It was examined by the usual chymical processes for arsenic, but it contained no trace of that poison.
" 2. CONTENTS OF THE JAR.
Thisjar containe-l-1, the stomach, 2, the spleen; 3, the kidneys; 4, the heart; 5, the liver and gall bladder ; 6, the small and large intestines.
" These different organs were very much shrank and diminished in size as the result of changes since death, but on the whole they were in a very good state of preservation, so that the parts could be separated at d recog-azed.
" 1. The Stomach.
"The stomach was reduced to about one half of its natural size. The coats were thin, but firm. When laid open the mucous membrane, or inner coat of the stomach was found covered with a thin, black, pasty-looking substance closet adhering to it, and giving a dark colour to all
ma coats. 'here was lo redness of the mucous membrane, and no mineral matter could be perceived by a magnifying
glass 'when the surface was examined. The coats with the black substance adhering to the inside of the stomach were examined for mineral poison, with the result that a small quantity of arsenic was separated from them. No other metal or metallic compound was detected. There was no trace of any kind of food.
"' 2. The Spleen.
"Tho spleen was small, much diminished in size; itg substance was soft, and easily broken down. It yielded a aight indication of the presence of arsenic.
' 3. The Kidneys.
"These wero shrunk to about one-third of the natural size; they were of a reddish brown colour, moderately firm whei. cut, and were imbedded in a large quantity of fat, part of which had been converted into adipocere. Arsenic was detected in them in larger proportion than in the spleen, but in smaller puantity than in the stomach.
.4. The Heart.
This was collapsed; its cavities were quito empty, and itwas miuch reduced in size The outside of the organ was loaded with fat. The valves in the ventricles were plainly recognizable; they were free from any ossific deposit. The
application of the same chymical process to this organ as to t e stomach showed that it did not contain any arsnic.
' 5. The Lver and Gall Bladder.
of 49 The lver weighed about 21b., which is about one-balf
its normal weight. Its structure was firm and of a dark reddish brown colour; it was in a good state of
preservation. Twelve ounces were taken for analyiis, and arsenic was separated from this quantity in about the same
proporion as from the whole of the stomach. The gall badder was also well preserYed; its coats were firm, and the inner coat was deeply stainued and covered by a layer of thick bile. There sqr ub gal atones, The gall bladder,
'With its coutents, yieldeda rsenic in greater proportion than the stomach.
di "6. Smial Intestines.
The coats were thin and collapsed, but firm and rather tough; in fact, they were weU preserved. Excepting the duodenum, they were empty or contained only air. In some parts the mucous membrane was covered with a thin, black, Pasty substance like that feund in the stomach. This was espeCally observed in the duodenum, or that portion which is connected with the stomach. The duodenum contained arsenic in greater proportion than the stomach. About one-third of the smaul intestines, taken from different parts of their length, also yielded arsenic in greater proportion than the stoAch.
"Large Intestines.
"The coats were firm, and equally well preserved. A plac asty-looking substance was found, but nothing of a mlinerat nature could he detected by the aid of a mignifyingglass. There was no redness of the coats of the large intestines. On analyzing, the large intestines with their contenrts yielhded arsenic in about the same proportion as the parts of the small tntestines examined. There were, also, in the rectumt traces of mercury and antimnony.
"MOULD FROMI THE GrANV.
"Twenty-two ounces of this were examined for arsenic. it contained none, either in a solable or insolable form. It consisted of ordinary clay, sand, carbonate of lime, and oxide of iron, with vegetable roots and fibres.

[Dr. Taylor produced a small phial containing a piece of copper which had been tinged of an iron-gray colour by the action of the arsenic found in the body of the deceased. With this was exhibited a piece of pure copper by way of contrast.)
Mr. Barber, surgeon, examined.-I have been in practice as a surgeon in Stamford for-about 20 years. I first attended the deceased on the 20th of M1arch, 1S55. I found her in a fit. This was about 10 o'clock in the morning. She was resting on a chair at fuU length, ber arms and legs beine quite stiff and her body hard. She was unable to speak,and seemed in considerable pain. The only information I could get was that she had fallen down suddenly. I immediately gave her an emetic, and in a few hours she was relieved and able to express how she felt. She told me she had great psin and tenderness of the abdomen. I attended herfor ten
ays on this ocasion; she gradually improved and eventually recovered, but was stiU very weak.
By Dr. Taylor.-There was no vemiting before the emetic was administered. She did not particularly complain of being thirsty.
By the Coroner.-I thought she had taken something which had disordered her stomach.
By Dr. Taylor.-Thero was coldness of the surface, deceased having fallen on the floor.
Bv the Coroner.-I did not again see the deceased professfonally until the 13th of M'iay. About 5 o'clock that afternoon I was requested to go to her son Thomass to see Mrs. Bacon. I found her sick. Thomas Fuller Bacon and his wife were attending her. She was very il, being at that time in Bacon's sitting-room. I was told she had been vomiting all the afternoon, and that she had been purged. This was stated to me by one of the three persons p resent, but I don't remember which. I observed somelui upon the floor, as though a person bad been vomiting. Deceased did not vomit in my presence. This appeared to me to be a case of En-lish cholera. The synptoms were quite differentfrom those au March. I gave deceased en opiate pil and some astringent mixture, and directed her to be taken home and put to bed. Thomas Bacon statedthat his mother had been dining with him that day, and that she was taken ill soon afterwards, and went and lay upon the bed. I saw Mrs. Bacon again at her own house between 8 and 9 o'clock the same evening and asain on Monday morning about 10 o'clock, ;hen she was still suffering from pains in the abdomen, and the general symptoms were not much relieved. The next time I saw her was about 8 o'clock in the evening, when she was much better. The purging and sickness were relieved, and for the astringent mixture I substituted an aromatic one. On Tuesday morning, between 7 and 8 o'clock, I was sent for to see Mrs. Bacon again. I fomnd her in bed. She had been taken worse during the night, with symptoms similar to those from which she suffered in March. She complained of violent pain in the abdomen, bad spasms, and her limbs were quite stiffforsome minutes together, whenthey became temporarily relaxed,and thestiffhessagain returned. I prescribed for her some antispasmodicmedicine. I was asked bysomeoftheinmates whether there was any danger, in order that deceased's daughter (Mrs. Smith), who resides at Titchmarsh, might be sent for, and I recommended then to wait until I had scen her again. I saw deceased again in about two hoursabout 10 o'clock. She was then suffering very much, and seemed a good deal depressed, and was at times not quite herself. The stiffless of the limbs and spasms stiU continuing, I ordered the deceased to be put in a warm bath, and then told them they had better send for Mrs. Smith, as I considered the deceased in danger. On visiting her again about mid-day I found that the bath had relieved the spasms, but that deceased was not so well, and was at intervals delirious. Her strength was much diminished. So far as I can recollect, I did not see deceased again until between 9 and 10 in the evening, when she was evidently sinking. I administered a little wine, and directed her attendants to repeat itfrom time to time. I did not see deceased again.
By Dr. Taylor.-I think deceased was 10 hours on the Monday without my seeing her. I did not then consider her in danger. On the Tuesday morning, at 10 o'clock, the vomiting had ceased, but there was tome pureing; this, however, and the other symptoms observable on Sunday disappeared during the day. The symptoms then remainingspasms, pain in the abdomen, &c.-were similar to those manifested in March.
By the Coroner.-I have undersbod that Mrs. B3con was not in perfect health from her illness in March until that in May, although I did not attend her professionally during that time. Having now heard from Dr. Taylor that he has doetected arsenic in the body of the deceased, I am of opinion that the symptomsswith which the deceased was attacked on the Sunday were those which arsenic would produce. I cannot express the same opinion as to the symptoms on Alonday and Tuesday, because they resembled those of the attack in iMarch, when they had not been preceded by vomiting and purging. When cailed upon for a certificate as to the cause of death, judging from the character of the attack in March and that on the day of her death on Tuesday, and the fact of her health having been precarious during the interval, I believed that she had died of cerebral disease.
By Dr. Taylor.-There was no examination of the body.
By a Juror-I supplied medicine on the Monday to be aRdinistered during the night.
Ann, wife of William Bacon, whitesmith, of Stamford, examined.-I saw the deceased on Saturday morning, the 12th of May. She then appeared quite welL I asked her at that time to dine with us on the following day, as usual. She had dined with us on several previous Sundays. Deceased repled that she thought she should remain at home. About 8 o'clock on Sunday evening I was sent for to .the house of the deceased in consequenee of her having been taken ill. Saw Thomas Fuller Bacon there. le told mue his mother had been taken illwhile at dinner at his houEe that day. I went upstairs and saw deceased, who stated, in the presence of Thomas Bacon and his wife, that she had felt very well in the morning, and was taken ill while sitting at the dinner-table, after partaking of some broth. She said she was seized with sickness and purging very violently. I think deceased vomited twice while I was with her; she did not bring up much, but " retched" considerably. She complained of thirst at this time and two folowing days up to her death, and was constantly asking for drink, I remained with deceased until 10 o'clock on the Sunday night, when I left her pretty comfortable. I again went to see deceased between 6 and 7 o'clock on the Monday morning. Thomas Bacon was then upstairs with his mother. He and I alternately gave Mrs. Bacon her medicine and barleywater during Monday and Tuesday, one holding her up in bed, while the other administered the liquid. On the Monday afternoon, from about 3 o'clock- until I left her, about 10, Mrs. Bacon was very much better. She partook of some tea. On Tuesday, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the morning, I went to Mrs. Bacon's again, and found her much wase. She had great pain in her body, and complained of beinstiff all over. Thomas Bacon was in the house when
I got there, and continued about all the day. During the morning I beard Thomas Bacon say to his wife, " Give mother something out of that bottle now." nointine to one on a dressing-table in the bedroom. Isaid, 'What isiti" Thomas Bacon replied, "Something that mother had yesterday that doesheer guofoFd. Iovbservedtha.titwassuotan orsinarymedicine

thodght it was a little peppermint, or something of that
bind. It contained a whitish coloured liqnid. On tbe night aIrs. Baconx died, and inmmediatey after her death, Thomas Bacon said, "This bottle belongs to me; I may as well take it away, as it will be of no furtheruse." Thin was the same bottle I haa previously observed on the dressing-table. My Lusband and myself had not generally any intimaoy with Thomas Bacon-he was such a disagreeable man ; but during the two days of his mother's illness hewasmuchmorefriendiy. I was present when Mrs. Bacon died About an hour and a half before her death I opened a drawer in which the rentbook belonging to Mrs. Bacon was usually kept, as our apprentice had been in the habit of setting down for her the mioney received. Thomas Bacon followed me upstairs aLnd said, " I suppose you have beeni looking for the rentbook?" I aid, " Yes, but it is not where it should be." He replied, I"-l1've got the book. I suppose you are aware that by my fatber's wil this house and all that it contains belong to

By Dr. Taylor.-Deoeased told me on that occWon that ahe had been purged before she was sick. She had spasms during the sick-ness; these came on about 10 o'clock m the morning.
By bir. Barber.-We never thought Mrs. Bacon quite so wi IL after her illuness in March as she had been previously.
tho ed betaylorI never heard her complain of pain-in tehabetwee March and May.
Professor Taylor here said.-Having heard the evidence of Mr. Barber and Mrs. Ann Bacon, as well as the deritiCDs ef Mary Riley, Mary Ann Scholes, and Blizabeib Blake, subsequent to my giving evidence upon the analysis, I am of opinion that the attak in 2larch as described by Mr. Barber and Ann Bacon, is unne tbe effects of arsenic; that the symptoms of pain, v miting, purging, and thirst on Sunday, May the 13th, oacumng a tr dinner, are such as vwould be and are comn,only produced by arseaic; and, as arsenic was found in the body, in my opinion they were occasioned by that poison. The symptoms observed on Monday night and on Tuesday of spasms and delirium with general depression, as described by Mur. Barber, are such as may be produced by arsenic when a person hag sarvived two or three days. They are not so common in cases of poisoning by arsenic as symptoms of vomiting and purging, and they may be produced by disease of the brain. Looking to the description of the symptoms on the attack ill March, and their similarity to those observed by Mr. Barber on Tuesday, May the 15th, it is possible that death may have been caused by a sudden recUrrence of disease of the brain, and notby arsenic. At the same time the symptoms of Sunuday, Mond*y, and Tuesday, in the month of gaEy, takenl together, as descrmbed by Mlr. ffarber and thle other witnesses, arc, in my opinion, conJsistenlt wiith death fromra rsenic.
The Professor subsequently added that he was not at all surprised at Mr. Barber coming to the conclusion that death resulted f o-, cerebral disease. Ninety-nine mnen out of a hundred might have come to the same conclusion. Ile, therefore did not think that any blame was attributable to Mr. Barber. In order to have ascertained whetherdeath was caused by cerebral disease, the brain should have been exain&ed 48 hours after death.
Maria, wife of Whitehead Smith, farrier, of Titchniarsh, and daughter of the deceased Ann Bacon, was called, but had no material evidence to give. Her daughter, about six years old, who said she saw something white in the broth given to the deceased by her son Thomas, was considered too young for examination.
Ann, wife of James Atton, pawnbroker, Stamford, examined.-I knew Mra. Bacon for many years; she was always a healthy person. I never heard her complain of pains in the head. I was going to see her on the Tuesday evening on which sbe died, when I met Thomas Bacon. I said, Iam sorry to hear your mother is much worse." He replied, " Yes, I believe it's an up with her, and that sbe's now taking her last." He appeared to me to be rather pleased than sorry at his mothc's illness.
Ellen Towers, of Stamford.-I recollec' deceased coming to my mother's house about 9 o'clock on the Sunday morning previous to her death. I heard her say a week or two before that the last two or three times she had beon to
' poor Tommy's" (meaning her son Thomas's) she had always been taken ill, and she could not think how it was.
William Bacon, brother of Thomas Fuller Bacon.-I re-member my brother Thomas observing to my father, about three tmonths previous to his death, which took place in October, 1854, that Mr. Patterson's " vermin-killer" was a good thing, and had killed his rats. The witness gave further evidence in corroboration of his wife's testimony,
Superintendent Mitchell, chief constable of the county of Rutland, examined.-I was present on the 6th of February inst. when a post mortem examination of the body of Ann Bacon was made by Mr. Jackson and Dr. Taylor. Dr. Taylor gave into my charge on that day a bottle containing some blood taken from the body of the deceased, and also a jar containing the intestines and other p arts, for analyzation. These I delivered again to Dr. Taylor at the railway sttion in Stamford on the same day. They were placed in a box, which I corded, and sealed with my seal.

RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.-Yesterday evening a public
IELIGOouS LIBERTY.-Ye8terday evening a public dinner took place in the large room of the London Tavern, at the instance of the Society for the Liberation of Religioun from State Patronage and Control. Mr. J. R. Aills took the chair, and there were also present-Sir W. Clay, Bart., M.P., Mr. J. Cheetham, M.P.; Mr. T. Barnes, M.P., MIr. W. S. Lindsay. M.P., Mr. E. Miali, ?LP., Mr. J. Bell, ALF., hlr. T. M. Weguelin, M.P., Mir. R. Miligan, M.P., Mr. J. Kershaw,.MI., Mr. L. 1Ieyworth, M.P., Sir J. Anderson, XP., Mr. Serjeant Parry, Mr. J. Mellor, Q.C., Mr. W. Pollard-Urquhart, MLP., Rev. W. Brock, Pev. J. Burnet, Mr. A. Wills, Mr. H. Bateman, lMr. E. C. White. hurst, hlr. Anderson, Mr. A. S. Ayrton, Dr. Foster, Mr. J. C. Evans, Mr. W. Shaen, Sir Morton Peto, Mr. J. Spicer, Mlr. W. Bateman, Mr. J. Soul, Mlr. Powell, &c. A most excellent dinner, served in the usual sty)e of the London Tavern, was done amplo justice to. The customary loyal and patriotic toasts having been given and duly responded to, the chairman gave the toast of " Equal Civil and Poltical Advantages to Persons in every Class of the Couinunity, irrespective of religious Distinctions, an esEential Element of Liberal Policy." The object of their meeting there that night was simply to enforce the old maxim of doing unto others what they would wisb done to themselves,-of having, in short, a religions peace, when CiVil advantages wo old no longer attach to the religious opinions of any creed. With wvhat right or justice, he would ask, could this Government refuse to interfere with any class of religionists in a Mahoumedan country when they were not prepared to accord the same religionsR freedom to all the denmninavions and sects wbich were al ady under their care? Mr. T. M. WVeguelin briefly adverted to the necessity which existed, in a society donstituted like that of this kingdom, in which religious differences abounded, that they should be regarded rather as an evidence of earnestness, and therefore there should be a mutual toleration anwong those who agreed to differ from the most conscientiousnmotives. No man should seek for any civil advantages as attached to his religious opinions, but content himself with a conviction of the truth of the creed which he possessed. They were all stories in one common building, differing, perhaps, in form and situation, but still belonging to the saime general edfice, with unity of sentiment, though differing in action. Mr. Barnes thought that nothing was to be obtained from the Government by concession. Governsnent concession on this subject was only the conces$ion of a thief overpowered by the police. Tle chair. man gave the "Health of Mlr. 3liall," in connexion with " impartial disendowment, the only practical method of insuring religious libertv in Ireland," and Mr. Mill, in responding, contended tbat whatever was sought by the promoters of that meeting was sought only as civil members of society, and quite irrespective of the creed which each might profess. 'Whether a man was a Gentile or Jew, a Protestant or Catholic, was Suite immaterial. All that each creed wanted from the State was fair consideration andprotection as good citizens, and whatever the Govesoment did should be done on that brsis, and apart from any religious opinions which oight be professed. He had, of course, opposed the endowment of Maynooth, not from any want of sympathy with his Catholc fellow-subjects, but simply because he believed that endowtment was a bulwark to the Irish Church Establishment, and bad been so considered by those who had first proposed it. So long as there were three religions denominations in Ireland endowed by the public, so long, he feared, would the friends of religious liberty be foiled in their attempts on behalf of the just principle which advocated the abolition of a11 State churches. Mr. Pollard-Urquhart added a few words in support of the toast, and almost regretted that he belonged to the Pr testant religion, which could sanction and support a scheme such as the Irish Church Establishment,-a plan which had been deservedly stigmatized by a modern historian as the ecclesiastical enormity of the age. He agreed with Mr. Mlacaulay that the pcople of England and Scotland had been made one because thtir Churches were two, and the people of Eugland and Ireland were two because their Churches had been made one. The Chairman gave "The total and unconditioznal Abolition of Cnurchrates," coupling with it the name of Siz William Clay, who briefly expressed his acknowledg. ments, and his intention to persevere with the movement with which that assembly had done him the honour to connect his name. Dr. Foster proposed, and Mr. Cheetham responded to, the toast of " Our Friends in the House of Connmons," and Sir S. M. Peto, having given "' The Health of the Chairman," and the toasts of the " Vice-Chairman and Steward'b having also been drunk, the proceedings terssinated.

To The Editor Of The Times.
1 2'O THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-The interest attacbing to the snbject is my only excuse for requesting space in your columns to draw attentoio
to the corclusions arrived at by Colonel TulUoch, and publisbed at page .179 of that offloer's recent review of the
Proceedings and Report of the Board of General Officers." These conclasions are of gpat importance, as they Appear to be the deliberate opinion of Colonel TuUoch, 'who has had every opportunity of studying the question, and Are the more remarkable as they contain the only suggestion of - remnedy that might have been applied to the state of affairs existing in the Crimea during the winter of 1854-55that ha3 yet emanated from either of the Commissioners. These de ductions are as foUows -
" 1 That such severe duties, combined with scanty nourishment and insufficient clothing, must, no doubt, hava added greatly to the sickness and mortality.
"2. That they necessarily prevented any such extensive undertaking as the formation of a road to Balakiava.
3. But that they could have presented no positive obstacle to the employment, say, of 1 nnen from each regiment for a single day early in December, and the like humber for another day in the end of that month or early in January, to carry up the rugs, greatcoats, blankets, coatees, and trousers in the Quartermaster-General's store, provided no other means of transport could have been devised."
Nos. 1 and 2 need no comment. I propose now to deal with No. 3.
The premises on which Colonel Tulloch has basedthis deduction are published in his work from page 172 to 178, nd include a return from the Adjutant-General, showing the effective strength of, and the duties furnished by, the army during that winter.
At page 175 it is stated " tbat many of the men nominaUy returned as effective were not capable of taking their duty." I might, therefore, dednot a certain number of men, say 3 per cent., from the effective strength, but this I do not propose doing, for, although the convalescents were unfit for trench duty or to be sent '" on fatigue" to Balaklava, they might have been fit for camp guard. I must, however. add to those on duty in the trenches the men on guard and picket, as it is evident they 'would not have been available to be sent to Balaklava to fetch stores.
Colonel Tulloch mentions " any day towards the latter end of December or beginning of January" for sending the number be proposes to Balaklava. I therefore take the week between the 22d of December and the 1st of January, as being the time specially aluded to, and it being immaterial what period is taken, as Colonel Tulloeh states the proportion between effectives and duties varied very little during the months of December, January, and February.
The effectives during that week appear to have bees 13,161; the duties furnished, exclusive of " fatigues," were 7,177 men daily.
It is apparent that at this time there were not two reliefs of duty men; the men, therefore, off duty on any given day had returned from the trenches and pickets at daylight, and a large proportion of the former would have to return to the trenches the same night. Now, considering the nature of that duty, it is difficult to imagine how Colonel TuUoch could propose that men 'who for 13 hours had been exposed to the elements at that season, to the efforts of the enemy, to groat labour in the construction and repair of the works, and rwithout food, should immnediately on their release from those duties be sent to Balaklava and hack, & distance of 14 miles, through a quagmire, returning heavily laden, and who, after depositing their loads about sunset, must have been immediately marched down to the trenches again Supposing that men could have performed this, which cannot be admitted, it 'would have been impolitic in the highest degree, for what reliance could have been placel on men so exhausted for either a vigorous defence of the trenches against sorties, which were constantly ocourring. or for the performance of the labour required in the niht ?
ItisequaUyturprigthat ColonelThUoehshold have proposedthattheeutireposition of the Britisharmyonthehei$hta should have been denuded oftroops fora 'whole dayatatime, when the recoUection of Inkermann was fresh in the mind and an attack constantly pending; deducting, therefore, the men on duty and the relief for the trenches (amounting then to 5,971), or 13,148 on " for duty" from the effectives 13,161, it appears there were 13 men available on paper i& the whole army to be sent to Balaklava on any day of the week selected.
I trust that the people of England will be able to appreciate the difficulties attendfag the administration of the Crimean army, when an officer of Colonel Tulloch's experience, after having been specially sent to the Crimea to investigate and report upon those difficulties, and who, after nearlytwo years' constant study of the subject, is only able to produce one suggestion for their alleviation, which could only have been carried out by the violation of all military rules, and at the risk of sacrificing the hononr and existence of the army.
A soldier might have spared Lord Raglan's memory a reproach for having declined an expedient attended by such a risk.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-In The 2TnzS of this morning, at the end of the article on Colonel Tulloch's book, you remark upon Colonel Rumley as having been unjustly promotei to be a MajorGeneral over the head of Colonel Tulloch.
As the writer of this article does not appear to be aware of the facts, I beg to enclose to yon the relative dates of the commissions of the two officers in question:-

e., Oct., Ame., N'ov., July. Colonel lIumley .. 1824 I125' 18a7 .18418 1. 818
You wilU perceive that Major-General Rnumley entered the army two years before Colonel TaUoeh, that he was a lieutenant 10 years before him, was a captain 11 years before him, and beeame a major two years after him, Colonel Tulloch having received military rank for serving in an offioe in London, under Lord Grey, out of his turn; so that Major-General Rumley has only got into his proper place again.
Major-General Rumley isweU known to be one of the ve!y best regimental officers in our army; he served with distinction in the Caffre war, has also served in India, and did everytthing he could to get to the Crimea, but was, much against hiswill and to his great disgust, retained at Malta, beiog found so very efficient in charge of the depots there.

The Case Of The Murderer Mansell.-The
THE OCASE or MTYIS DREn MANSELL.-The execution of this prisoner was to have taken place on the' 5th inst., but a respite has been sent, delaying the carrying out of the sentence until the 11th of Maly, in order that the legal point raised by his conusel, Mr. Russell, as to the validity of the jury by whom he was tried, may be first disposed of; and as the Court of Queen's Bench decided not to enter into the argument until the conclusion of the present ternm it was necessary for the sentence to be respited for tbis long period. It vill be recollected that at the trial the only defence setupfortheprisoner wasthathe wasnotin X state of mind to be accountable for his actions at the time ho deliberately sbot the unfortunate man for whose murder he was tried. There does not appear, however, the slightest ground for supposing that his mind is at all affected; but, on the contrary, he seems to be perfectly aware of the character of his crime, and his only desire apKears to be that he may escape the capital punishmeat. indeed, immediately after the trial he said tbat he should not have cared if he had been only sentenced to transportation for life. He eats and drink-s heartily, and is now evidently strongly impressed with the idea. that, after having been twice respited, and so lon
a delay being granted, the sentence of death will not be carriea out, aud aIthough MIr. Hilliard, the newly appointed governor of Maidstone Gaol, has frequently impreseed upon him the necessity of preparing for the worst, and explained to him the circomstances inder which the, respites have been granted, and that in the event of the point of law being decided against him the sentence would no doubt be carried into effect, it appears to have very little weight, and he evidently feels a strong conviction that his life will be spared. Two extra turnkeys are employed to watch the prisoner, one being constantly with him during the day and the other at night, so that he is never left alono. It has already been explained that the ground upon which the prisoner has been respited was that the counsel for the Crown had improperly chaUenged one of the jurors without cause ; but it seems that since the matter has been brought before the Court of Queen's Bench a new objection has been started, and it will be contended that the prisoner was entitled to have the jurynian who waa objected to empaneUed to try him, and that, having been. improperly put in peril, by the juryman having been rejected, the whole proceeding was not only invalid, but the prisonor cannot again be tried upon the same charge ; and f this objection, upon argument, should be stained, *nd order wl be made for the discharge of the vprsoner, and he will altogether escape the consequences of his act.

Not a word of comment accompanies the publication of the Emperor's speech at the opening of the Ojhambers yesterday. We may be certain, however, of the unqualified eulog,ie of a certain portion of the pres., of the cold and unwilling assent of others, and perhaps of the disdainful silence of the rest, The effect generally has, however, been rather satisfactory. People who had been afraid of a new loan have had their fears set at rest for the present; but this pleasure is someWhat alloyed by the anticipation of an impost on ralroad and other securities. The closing phrase, which is a quotation from M. Thiers' History of tr'e aConsate, is understood as an indirect, answer to some parts of M. Guizot's late discourse on the election of M. Biot to the French Academy.
Some critical persons find fault with the alusioa to the Revolution :-" The rivers of France, like the revolution, return to their bed, that they may never more issue from it." This is overconfident. The political inundations of France, they say, have been too profitable to the Bonapartist dynaasty for any member of it to speak of them inso scornful a manner. Had the revolution always remained " in its bed," the first of the name might have closed hi,s life as an officer of artillery, and his nephew would not now be lodging in the Tuileries, or haranguing Senators and Deputies from an Imperial throne on the immorality of revolutions. Revolutions are, no doubt, very bad things, but it is ungrateful in those who have reaped so rich a harvest from them to treat them so cavalierly. The Emperor may answer for his own power in keeping revolution within its bed, but who will guaf!antee that it will not issue from it when his hand is no longer felt? Of the many who have prospered under his protection, and who vie with each other in professions of enthusiastic attachment to his person, I doubt whether there are more than a dozen who, if a political inundation or any other casualty swept him and his away tomorrow, would not turn to his successor with declarations equally enthusiastic, equally servile, and equally false, whether that stuccessor were the Count de Chambord or the Count de Paris.
The ratifications of the treaty signed between Russia and Persia on the 5th of January last were exchanged at Teheran on the 18th of the same mionth. This treaty cedes to Russia a tract of land on the frontiers of Turkey. This tract is situate betwreen Bagazid and NSakhshivan. This new possession will gie Russia a complete commnand of the strategic road from Trebizonde on the Black Sea to the Persian frontier by Erzeroum. The Russian Government has been endeavouring since the treaty signed with Persia on the 22d February, 1828, to obtain the advantage which Persia has now granted.
It is asserted that orders were immediately sent from St. Petersburg to construct a line of fortresses on the territory lately ceded.
The last accounts received by the French Government from Persia announce that Fezlali Khan, who commands the advanced guard of the Persian army in Farsistan, had sent forward, on the 25th of December, a strong reconnoitring party of cavalry as far as 50 miles in advance of Shiraz. This demonstration, though so far from the British camp, had given rise to a report of an approaching attack on the English lines by the entire Persian army, but this is impossible, for the Persians, who have been joined by the Turcomans, have none but irregular cavalry in the province of Fars,with which it would be impossible to make an impression on the well-fortifed position of theEnglish army atBushire.

"Whereas Catherine Fanelli, a young woman of 23 years, born in Casalviera, diocess of Sora, residing for several years past at Sezza, has attempted by clever representations to pass herself off as a saint, and has boasted of revelations, visions, appariti ns of Jesus Christ and of the holy Mary, and of other peculiar gifts proceeding from the grace of God; and whereas it is evident from various acts and proofs, as well as from her confession when on trial before the lHoly office, that here is only deceit, boasting, and falsity in the aforesaid zevelations, visions, apparitions, and other matters reputed as supernatural and as marks of the peculiar grace of God; in consequence, in execution of the decree of the Holy Office of February 4, 1857, in order to undeceive the public, and remove from the minds of all any belief in her holy character, we notify and declare that the holiness of the above-mentioned Catherine Fanlli is pretended and accom. panied by immoral and false maximRs, and that her pro. dictions have been proved to be supposititious; the said Woman has therefore been condemned by the Holy Office to 12 years' imprisonment. Let therefore no person in future dare to consider the said Catherine Fanelli in the light of a saint, under the penalty to be established by the most eminent and reverend cardinals, the Inquisitors- GeneraL

Although the finishing touch has not yet been put to the draught of the plan for the future government of the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom, persons who are generally well-informed on such matters state that the Archduke Ferdinand Max is likely to receive from the Emperor, his brother, much more extensive powers than were held by the Archduke Reignier, who was Viceroy up to the year 1848. the following are said to be the principal features of the proposed plan of administration :-His Imperial Highness the Archduke F?erdinand Max to be the aZer eyo of His Majesty, and as such to receive his instructions directly from him. One of the Aulic CounciUors of the Home Department,who is to have the management of matters connected with the organization of the LombardoVenetian kingdom, to be attached to the GovernorGeneral. Judicial matters to be under the more immediate direction of the Supreme Court of Justice for Lombardy and Venice, which, as a matter of course, is responsible to the Minister of Justice for its actions. The Governor-General will have to do all in his power to maintain the unity of the empire, but he will be at liberty to take into consideration any wishes of the people that are not antagonistic
to it. His Imperial B'ighness may, should ]he deem it advisable, give employment to persons who, though disloYal during the revolution, have since behaved welL Count Thun is to be the Civil AdIatus of the Governor-General, but it is not yet known whethqr Baron Hess, Count Gyulai, or General
1enedek wiil be his mnilitary adjunct. M. de Lackenbacher, the Aulic Councillor of the Home Department, who has been at Milan for the last three or four years, will probably belattached to the Archduke, as he is an able employd and a man of conciliatory manners,
Somne further details relative to what passed a few days since between the Archduke Albrecht and the Hungarian Committee are now known. The Comnmittee charged to make the necessary preparations for the reception of their Majesties is composed of Prince Paul Esterhazy, Counts Bela Wenkheim, Emmanuel Andrasy, John Czirfaky, FelixZichy, and of several other nobles, whose names sound well in Hungarian ears. It was the wish of the Imperial Government that the Emperor and Empress should be received on the frontiers by a Landes-Bawnde-um, or deputation of the whole of the Hungarian nobility, but the Commnittee called its attention to the fact that the country was divided into five districts, which were entirely independent of each other. On
the 8th the Committee waited ou the-Archduke, and informed him that the nobles would do all in their power to render the sojourn of their Majesties in Hungary agreeable, but that they could not answer for any enthusiasm on the part of the nation. Count Wenkheim is said to have observed that the Hungarians still deplored the loss of the Constitution which they and their forefathers had possessed for 800 years, and Count John Cziriky complained that the German language had taken the place of the Hungarian in the administration and in the public schools. Another member of the Committee remarked that tL.e country was inundated with foreign employes, who knew as little oi the real state of the country as they did of the language of its inhabitants.
After reading this, you will naturally come
to the conclusion that their Majesties are likely I to meet with a remarkably cool reception in Hungary, but persons who know the national character are of opinion that the concessions which Government is willing to make to the Magyars will put them into a much better humour than that in which they have been for the last few years. There are certain things which the Imperial Government cannot and will not grant, but it is a patent fact that it intends to be less particular about trifles than it has hitherto been. Foreign affairs, finances, and everything connected with the army are and always will be " tabooed " to the provincial parliaments, but the Central Government is not likely to turn a deaf ear to their representations on any other subject.
The principal topic of conversation is still the MoniteUr's article on the Danubian Principalities, but it is not necessary to communicate to you the luctubrations of the politicians of this city, as Austria is resolved to do all in her power to prevent the union of the Danubian Principalities, which would be almost as pernicious to her as it would be to Turkey. The Russians now say that the union of the two Principalities is a matter of perfect indifference to themn, they used very diferent language a few months since.
We hear that the Emaperor Alexander will avoid passing through Vienna on his way to Nice. His Majesty will go by Berlin, Dresden, Munich, aud Stuttgard, the capitals of States in which the influence of Russia is now greater than ever.
There is just now a deadly feud here between the Lord Chamberlain, as Director of the Court theatres, on the one side, and the danseuses of the Opera and the public on the other. An order has been issued by Count Lansckorowski, the functionary in question, that the ladies shall in future wear "inexpressibles," and they protest that they cannot dance in such " nasty things."

BERLIN, FsB. 15.
The two Chambers here were a long time before they got well to work this session, owing, in a great measure, to the unsettled state of the Neuchatel affair, which compelled the Finance Minister to keep back his budget. From the 29th of November, the day the session opened, up to Christmas, the House of Deputies had but six sittings, while the House of Notables took it stiU easier. These six sittings were taken up for the most part
with the necessary business of getting the I House into working order, with electing its officers, constituting its committees or bureaux, investigating the validity of elections that have taken place since last session, &c. The said six sittings offer little that is remarkable, but one thing is worth noting, viz., the result of the voting, which is thus effected here-each member on his name being called out by the clerk deposits a card in the urn placed in front of the President, and in full view of the whole house. It has, however, already happened frequently that more cards have been inserted in the urn than there were merabers present, an irregularity which of course leads to much discussion to and fro, and consequent loss of time. On the cards thus thrown into the urn the member writes " Aye" or "C No," as may be, or the name of the person he votes for; and it moreover often happens that what is written on the cards is illegible, and very frequently also that there is no writing at all on them.
The standing conunittee-, or bureaux, are constituted by appointing to them men whose knowledge and experience fit them for the consideration of the special subject assigned to the committee, such as financial, juridical, commercial, agrarian, communal, educational, &c. The committee for petitions is similarly divided into a number of sections, so that each petition may come to be examined by men who have some knowledge of the subject to which the petition refers, and subsequently during the course of the session special committees are appointed for the consideration of any such subjects as do not fall strictly under any of the above-mentioned definite categories, or such as require peculiar expedition. The real business of legislation is thus transacted in the committees, for it is very seldom that the House acts in opposition to the recommendation contained in the report brought up on any motion by thecommittee appointed to consider it. The great party struggle next after the election of President is, therefore, the nomination of members to the committees; in all these latter, as well as with the officers of the House, the Right or Tory side has the decided majority and an overpowering influence in the present Houseof Deputies. To obviate this as far as lies in their power the Left or Liberal side has formed dilettanti committees of its own for arranging among its constituent members the motions it shall make, the amendments it shall bring in, and the general course of tactics it shall observe.
The enormous preponderance which the Tory side of the House possesses seems to have given rise in their breasts to the hope that it might be . possible to oust this Ministry and procure it to be replaced by one entirely made up of their own, or Junker, party. This hope has been flattered for some timc past by the circumstance that Ministers are now obliged, after putting it off much longer than they ought, to turn their attention to financial matters, and to look out for additional sources of revenue to meet the increasing wants of the State. This appeal of the bMinistry to the representatives of the people for increased taxation, than which nothing can be more monstrous to a Prussian mind, enables the Tory Opposition to hoist the popular colours of economy, &c., while it strives to overthrow the Ministry, and at any rate to further its own party views in the organization of the State. It resists the demands for maore pecuniary means (to enable the Government to pay its half-starved servants better) by showing that the work ought to be done with much fewer hands, who would thus be better paid at the same expense to the State, and that the expensive machinery of a concentrated and centralized administration might be rendered much less costly by decentralization, and the employment of local and for the most part unpaid officers. To strengthen all these propositions, plausible enough as they are of themselves, the example of England is always put forward, with her justices of the peace, her Lords-Lieutenant, her special constables, and everybody else that is publicspirited enough to take gratuitous office for the good of the public; but the real struggle is not as it is here put forward; it is, in a new form, the old struggle between the two great rival
elements in the social edifice of Prussia, - beteen Junkerthum and Beamtenthum, between the country party and red tape. These Junkers have already got so far as to give some grounds for reports of
changes being about to take place in the Ministry, of a dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies, and various other catastrophes, but as yet it has not
gone any further than reports; and of one thing, your readers may rest assured, that no hostile majority of the popular branch of the Legislature here will avail anything to bring about a change of Ministry. One or more Ministers may chance to get tired of their posts and retire, or they may displease the King and be dismissed; bht they will not of their own accord go out on accountof a hostile majority.

Sir,-In Mr. Vernon Smith's speech, as reported In The Tmes of the 13th inst., in alluding to the distinguished services of Sir George Pollock in Affghanistan in 1842, Mr. Smith is stated to have said that i" "forcing" the Khyber Pass Sir George Pollock had effected that which "Nadir Shah had only accomplished by corruption." Hlad Mr. Smith referred to the reeords of his office he would have seen that the Government of India, in reporting the result
of the expedition of Sir Claudo Wade through that pass in| 1839, remarked, " It is not on record that the Khyber Pass has ever previously been forced," which was three years before Sir George Pollock's operations.
Such a mistake is injurious to the reputation of an officer who received his honours for the successful performance of that service, and it is to .be hoped, therefore, that Mr. Smith will see the justice of tectifying his error.

Emigration.
-sM1GaTZao&.
TO THB EDIT'OR OF THE TThES.
Sir,-I was called upon last night to preside over a very large meeting of intelltgent worling men, held in ray largest schoolroom, to consider the best way of affording facilities for emigration.
For a considerable time I have noticed the growing convietions of the working classes that emigratiort must be looked to by them as the soundest and most permanent mode of relief to their own position.
The several causes, which must permanently exist, and rather increase than otherwise, of augmenting the already fearful disparity in the labour-market between the supply and demand, appear to them to be such as cannot be contravened and ameliorated by any other certain or probable arrangements or circumstances.
Indeed, the working nmen appear to me to be at present quite emancipated from those several theories which have been long since presented to their attention by well-intentioned, but evidently not practical men.
As our country is in possession of such valuable and snitable colonies, and as British America is so accessible, and now so well developed, as to afford an ample and comfortable home to the surplus population of our nation, especiaUy those conneeted with the brilding trades aad agricultural pursuits, and as the people of our large towns, and especially London and its neighbourhood, have suffered so much and so patiently, and are wivmg by weekly contributions to do what in them lies to provide a fund for their own emigration, it would be most desirable that tho 3 of the upper classes who may be philanthropically disposed would lend the aid of their advice and support, thereby encouragmg tbe praiseworthy efforts of the working people.
All must admit that the comfortable wages of artisans generally are intimately connected with the prosperity of the classes just over them, and those large sections of sutch as our East-end middle class.
If the sutpply of working people continue to be so much larger than the demand for abour, general depression and distress must be the inevitable result.
The law of political economy in reference to the labour qrtestion is insurmountable, and no combination of either masters on the one hand or their workmen on the other can alter it.

To sho w you the favourable temper of the working men at this moment in this locality I may mention that I have made to them the following offer-that if they wil on'y contribute every farthing of the money which is generaUy and on an average spent in beer and other intoxicating drinks by the working classes, as families and individnals, when in full work, that our committee will guarantee a passage to British America, within 12 months, to ,ash family, or to any person, so faithfuly and regularly making such entire payments, of course securing to each contribator the full amount of his whole contribution in case the sum of his contributions may realize at the end of the term a larger sum.

(Before the LORDS JusTIxCs oF APP&.
Mx. BACON and Mr. W. D. LLms appeared in EUpport of an application for leave to appeal to the House of Lords against the deoision of the Lords Justices, refusing to annul an adjudication of bankruptcy pronounced against the above company. The application was founded on the 18th section of the Bankrupt Law Consolidation Act, the 12th aud 13th of Victoria, c. 106, by whichlit is enacted " that if the Lord Chancellor sbhll in any case deem any matter of lawv or equity brought before him by way of appeal to be of suffcient dcffeulty or importance to re quire the decision of the House of Lords" (or in a certain other case), " then or in such case the whole facts whereupon such question of law or equity shall arise shaUl be sttevd in the form of a petition of appeal to the House of Lords; and the party appealing may carry an appeal to the House ef Lords in like manner as other appeals are preferred to that House."
L,ordJustice K;hrGJn' BR1JCE celed on the parties who opposed the applcation to say why the appeal should not be presened
Mr. RoLv at considerable length argued that the whole matter was in the discretion of the Court, and when it was considered that the assignees had been acting so long on the assumption that the decision of this Conrt would stand - that a dividend of 5s. 6d. in the pound had been paid amounting to 150,0001.; that another dividend would be paid ma March of at least 50,000D. ; and that 80,0004 was about to be collected to meet a compromise, which had been all but agreed to, the Court would not allow a petition to the House of Lords to intervene, and so cause the utter ruin of the shareholders. If it were known that an appeal was to go to the House of Lords the compromise wouldbo put an end to, and all debtors would refuse to pay.
Air. G. Xd. GiPFARD-and mr. Joszpn BUBRxE (of the common law bar) followed on the same side.
Mr. SFLWYNs appeared to oppose the application on behalf of some solvent shareholders, who were willing to pay if the litigation could be put an end to.
Mr. SIVWASTO2N, for the directors, also opposed the appli. cation.
Lord Justice KG}IT BRUCE said he should have thought, and his learned brother, he believed, thought, that if the application had been made immediately or soon after the decision of this Court the right of the petitioner to have his appeal heard before the House of Lords was plain, as the difficulty and importance of the question were manifest. His Lordship was suprised that such arguments against that right could have been presented to the Court by such counsel as had been heard. The question of time ws, however, material, and the reply vvould be confined to
Lord Justice TUIPNiEn was exactly of the same opinion as to time, but gave no opinon on any other point.
Mr. BAcoN explained that though the order was made so long ago as the 19th of December, yet that it had not been drawn up ; that the petitioner laid instructions before him to apply for leave to appeal on or about the 13th of January; that the hope existed thata compromise would be effected, and therefore Mr. Marcus had not been in a hurry to apply to the Court; but when he found that further delay took place he then presented his petition.
Witnesses were examined vivd voce by the Court, from whose testimony it appeared that the assignees had had no notice of the intention to appeal until Saturday last, the 14th of Febrary inst.
Mr. W. D. LEwis addressed the Court in favour of the application, and in very strong language denounced the amount of litigation and the impropriety of the proceedings in bankruptcy -after the order for winding up had been made.
Lord Justice K'GHT BRUCx said that, according to his opinion of the true construction of tho act of Parliament, it was incmbent on a party wishing to appeal to make the application at the time, or immediately or within a reasonable time after the order had been pronounced. True it was that what was a reasonable time in one case would not be so in another. If ever there was a case in which diligence in aslowing an intention to appeal ought to have been manifested, this was the case. Here the assignees had, to the Inowledge of MIr. Marcus, made dividends, brought actions, effected sales, and otherwise coUeeted the assets, and the only excuse for not coming earlier was, that the order of the 19th of Decemnber had not been formaIly completed. The only thing which was wanted in that order was to fill in a blank for a sum of money, and that order had been drawn up by his learned brother with care and prooision, and upon the footing of the order the assignees had acted, and no intimation, direct or indirect, had been given to them by MTr. Marcus or on his behalf that he intended to dispute its validity until Saturday last. Under these circumstances his Lordship was of opinion that an unreasonable time had been permitted to elapse, and therefore an appeal to the House of Lords could notbe Permitted. His Lordship reiterated his clear opinion that if the application had been mado in due time it must have been successful.
Lord Justice TusNEtR was entirely of the same opinion, and agreed that the application must be refused, but without costs. His Lordslip regretted to bo obliged to come to that conclusion, inasmuch as it was a refusal to allow an appeal from a decision of this Court, which under ordinary circumstances he should most cheerfully allow.

Walton, hipbroker Of Gracechurchstreet, and a shareholder in the said bank, in respect to any debt owing to Powis from the British Bank, or on any judgment obtained by him against Mr. Harding, its odficial manager. It appearce that Powis, who was a depositor to the amount of 5701., on the 9th of January just passed brought his action against Harding, and recovered judgment on the 29th. upon the sheriffs being served with the writ, they returned "no effects," and consequently Powis had been left to get his money as he best could. This he had accomplished to the extent of 4441.,-partly from a dividend of 1561. paid by the bank, and partly on an execution issued against a Mr. Heather, another unfortunate shareholder. Mr. Walton, -whose estato Powis now wished to proceed against at law, and which bas recently been sworn under 50,0001., died subsequently to the stoppage of the bank, and his estate was being administered under the order of the Court of Chancery. Notwithstaruding such administration, however, Powis iesisted on his riglht of taking proceedin
at law against Walton's estate, and it was to restrain him from so doing that the present injunction was moved for.
Mr. WIASFORD having been heard in support of Powis's right to proceed at law, and against the injunction,
His Hoszou~ said that there was no necessity to go to law to obtain execution against Mr. Walton's estate while being administered in Chancery, inasmuch as Mr. Powis could obtain in the latter court all the relief he had any right to insist on.

VICE-CISANCELLOR3' COURTS. WEDN-saky. Fn. 1 R
CLARKE V. TIE ROVAr. PA.AnrN.
(Before Vithe-ncehnor Sir R. T. Kmn-DRsLEv-
This case was argued on the 11th and 12th of this month upon two motions-one bv the mortgagees and the other by the council of the Poyal Panopticon in Veicester-square, and both having for their object the dissolution of an injunction granted by his HIonour during the long vacation to restrain a sale of the concern, building, &c., when the matter was argued by connsel on eitherside. The questions now at issue were whether the counoil had power to authorize the mortgagees to sell, and, if not, whether the council themselves had such power? His Honour, when the motions were argued, was clearly of opinion that the council had full power to deal with the property of the corporation as they thought fit, with the authority of a general meeting, there heing nothing to show that such sanction had not been obtained; but upon the question whether they were right in delegating the power of sellin
to the mortgagees-that is, whether they had any such tower under the charter and deed of settlement-his nonour reserved his decision.
Mr. Baily and Mr. C. HIall appeared upon the first motion; Mr. Rawlineon, for other mortgagees, supported the dissolution of the injunction;- Mr. Glasse and Mr. Beales appeared -upon the second motion for the council; Mr. Terreil and MIr. Stiffe opposed both raotions on behalf of the plaintiff.
The VICE-B L CELLOR now said that it was remarkable that there should be such a dearth of authorities upon the chief point raised in this case-namely, whether a special power to a trustee to mortgage included a power to mortgage with a power of sale. But upon principle clearly established he apprehended that beyond all question a special power to a trustee to mortgage did not include a power to mnortgage with power of ele. If it did it would involve the absurd result thht-&-trustee with special power to mortgage, and who himself had no power to sell, could delegate such a power to another. It was said that the practice had becomeuniversato 2ier in every mortgage a powe6r ofsale, and no doubt it had become more common than it was 30 years smnce, wrhen he (the Vioe-Chancellor) ihrat attended to
tisematters, but it could never be considered1 as a necessary incident. It was said that a trustee might do wrhat-
ever a prUdentowner might do, butthat was moet fa&la. ciouNs, for a prudent owner might do many thingswhich in a trustee would be a downright breach of trust- for instance, in owner might invest in railway simzes, or in shares in the Roval rritish Bank or the Tipperary Bank, or any of such bodies as h lately become so notorious, but how could a trustee do. so? The practice of giving such ; rwer had become far less desirable since the Chaucer provement Act, 'which enabled mortgagees or mortgagors to sell or foreclose, and that was a very beneficial provision' The charter and deed of settlement gave a power to sell or mortgzge, and, applying the principae referred to, that did not enable a mortgage with power of sale. This applied to the land. The .hatteg, comp Ising the objects of science and art, stood on a different footing, inasmuch as they could not be mortgaged without a bill of sale, or some such instrument, to make the security of any value, and therefore, with regard to those chattels, there was a right in the mortgagees to BselL Then came the question whether the plaintiff had by his concurrence or acquiescence debarred himself from obtaining relief in this court by injunction, and maintaining that injunction? His Honour then referred to the circumstances attending the mortgages, and said that, even assuming, as it was alleged that MIr. Clarke had ever objected to and voted against what he complained of, as the matter took place in 1853, and he had laiu by until 1356, he was now nrecluded from any relief in consequenoe. Nay more, the authorities went further, and decided that wvhere, as here, a party sued on behalf of himself and others the acquiescence and concurrence of any one of those others were safficient to disentitle a plaintiff to relief, although he might not then have been a member of the body. With respect to the second motion, it was difficult to see why the council had been ia. cluded in the injunction, for as owners, of course, they were able to deal vith the property as they thought fit. The statements in the bill were sufficient to blind the defendants to the circumstances, and therefore it was com-
tent to them now to raise the question of acquiescenc. Upon these grounds, although the mortgagees had no power tosellthe land,etuponthe ground of acquiescence and full power in the council, the injunction must be dissolved with costs as to both motions, incuding the costs of obtain1ing this injunction.

LEYCESTER V. LOGANf.
The VICE-CHANCXLLOR gave judgment on this Inotion, which was argued on Tuesday. It was an application under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854. The plaintiffs were registered owners of the FalcOn steamship, whichbelonged to the Cork Steamship Company, and piied between Cor and Liverpool. On the 21st of September, 1856, a COllisiou took place off Holyhead between the Falcon, on her voyage from Cork to Liverpool, and the ship Imogene, which had left Liverpool the previous day on a voyage to Pernambuco. The imogene foundered shortly after, and was totally lost. The crew and passengers were saved, and taken on board the Falcon, but he cargo and effects were lost vith the ship. Actions had been commenced in the Admiralty Court at the suit of the several defendants for the value of the ship, the value of the goods and private offects of the passengers, and the value of the cargo. On the 16th of January, 1857, judgment was given in the Admiralty Court in one of the actions there commenced, and the owners of the Falcon, which bad been arrested by powers of the Admiralty Court, were condemned in the damages and losses consequent on the collision, with costs. On the 30th of January a commission of appraisement and sale of the Falcon was granted in the Admiralty Court, The plaintiffs, who had admitted that they were answerable in amages to the extent of the value of the Falcon and her freight, which they admitted to be insuficient to answer the claims made in respect of the loss of the Lmogene, exceeding in the aggregate the sum of 90,0001., had filed their bill for the purpose of obtaining the benefit of the limitation of liability presented by the 504th section of the above act - and now moved for an injunction to restrain the defendant Logan, who had obtained the judgmentin the Admiralty Court, from proceedings to compel or procare a sale of the Falcon, and also to restrain the prosecution of the other actions commenced against the plaintiffs.
Mr. Cairns and Mr. Baggdi.y supported the motionMr. Rolt and Mr. Cole appeared for the defendant Logan and Mr. Druce for other defendants.
The VICE-CiTANCELwoR said that, with the exception of the defendant Logan, the case was simple enongh; but, as to him, he had obtained the condemnation of the ship in the Admiralty Court, and he insisted that, having asserted his rights in rem, he was entitled to retain out of the proceeds of the ship the fuU amount of what he had recovered. Looking to the act, which in some respects foHowed the provisions of former acts, it was clearly intended that the ship. owner should not be liable for more than the value of the ship. Section 504 was explicit as to the limit of this liability, and the means of securing the benefit to the ship. owner were clearly laid down in section 514. With reference to the terms of this latter section, it was contended for Logan that his suit in the Admiralty Court could not be considered a "pending" suit, as he had obtained a definitive decree, and, moreover, that the object of the act was not to deprive parties of their remedy in rem, but only to limit the per. sonal liability of the owner, and that the particnlar question now before the Court was a ca.us omissus in the act. This argument could not be sustained. The liability of the shipowner to have his ship confiscated could not be separated from his personal liability. The real difficulty in the case was that here Logan had obtained an advantage in gatting the security of the ship for his proportion, at all events of the'sum recovered by him in the Admiralty Court, and for the costs of his proceedings there. The act being wholly silent as to any control to be exereised by this Court over the ship itself, this Court could not interfere except by way of imposing conditions upon Logan in disposing of the proceeds of the sale. As to the argument that this could not be regarded as a pending suit, it would be a very narrow construction of the aot if it were to be held that so long as ths property (the ship) was not actually sold this Court could not interfere. But, inasmuch as theship was under the sentence of the Admiralty Court, and therefore neither under the control of the plaintiff nor of this Court, the proper course would be not to interfere with Mr. Logan's right to sell the ship, butto take care that he did not realize out of the proceeds of the sale more than his proper share, having regard to apportionment between himself and the other defendants. The order would be-Let the plaintiff pay into this court the value of the ship at the penod of collision ulra the present value, the value of the frei-ht, and also the costs! of Mr. Logan of his proceedings in thse Admiralty Court. Direct the usual inquiry as to the claims of the defendants. Restrain Logan from taking any farther proceedings in the Admiralty Court, subject to his being at liberty to sell the ship, and to retain out of the proceeds such costs as he might be held entitled to under the decision of the Admiralty Court. Order him and all other parties to the suit to coicur in all necessary acts for transferring the balance of the proceeds of the sale into this court. Rlestrain all the other defendaInts from further proceedings in the Admiralty Court with liberty to apply.

This was a suit to cancel an assignmnent of the business of a surgeon latelv carried on by the defendant, Mr. Thomas, Jun., at No. 4, Glocester-street, Pimlico, and purchased by the plaintiff, Dr. Nott, and to deliver up a bond given by the latter and his brother-in-law, Mrx. adclyffe, to secure the balance of the purchase-money.

(Siting at Nisi Prium. before Lord CA3WBELL and
Spocia Jurica.1
Air. AL Chambers, Q.C., and Mr. Joyce appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Bovill, Q.C., and Mr. Kingdon for the defendant.
The plaintiff in this action was a blacksmith, formerly living at No. 6, Green-bank, Old Gravel-lane, Wapping ; and the defendant, A. H1. Bosanquet, was the chairman of the Imperial Fire Insurance Company. The action was brought upon a policy of insurance for 400. against fire effected with the defendant's comn any on the 14th of February, 1856, upon the plaintiff's house, stock, and furniture, which were entirely destroyed in a fire which took place on the premises on the night of the 22d of September, 1856. The defendants pleaded that in the account of the lots alleged in the declaration there was fraud in stating the value of the goods, plate, linen, &c., in the house at the time of the flre; tbe goods were valued in the policy at 1501., and the only question now was whether the claim made for lfi31. in respect of the goods, &e., was fraudulent. The plaintiff, his wife, son, daughter, and the husband of the latter were caUed as witnesses, and they proved that the house, which consisted of a shop, parlour, kitchen, and bedroom, with a "bunk" up a ladder, was weU furnished throughout. The witnesses were aU cross-examined to show that their account of the furniture was not accurate, and that a large quantity had been removed a short time before the fire to the bouse of a Mrs. Hubbard, where the plaintiffs daughter had gone to reside with her husband. The witnesses all declaredthat, notwithstanding the removal of the daughter's furniture, the room in which it was had snce been well filled by other furniture, and that aU the rooms were well and suitably furnished, and that the furniture was of the value of 16.31., as stated in the claim. It also appeared that when the property was insured the surveyor of the company had gone over thdl property, and was quite satisfied with its being insured for 150 .
The defence was that the claim was fraudulent, and several witnesses were called in support of this defence. A policeman proved that when he discovered the fire the flames were proceeding from the bedroom behind the shop. A part of the roof fell into that room, and in themorning a fireman found among the rubbish a keg or pot, which appeared to have been burnt, and to have contained some paint at the bottom, and over it what appeared to be pitch, which had boiled over. The floor was not burnt except near the keg. There were no remains of furniture in the room. Several witnesses stated that they were in the shop a few days before the fire, and could see into the room through a window and glass door, and there was nothing there but a line with something hanging upon it. Ms. Hubbard, who lived next door, stated that on Monday, the 1st of September, the plaintiff's daughter had hired a room in ber house and filled it full of furniture removed from the plaintifl's house. The removal of furniture was proved by several witnesses, and Mr. Jury, the surveyor of thecompany, stated thaton going over the premises on the moring after the fire he did not find, as was usual in such cases, ny remwins of bedding or carpets. It appeared that the plaintiff bad on one occasion ridden on horseback in a procession of teetotallers, and he bad had his portrait painted sitting on horseback. Thib portrait was Bung up iu the sitting-room, and was alleg ed by the plaintifl'wstnesseB, to have been burnit; bnt, on the part of te defendants, several witnesses were called who atted that not only " The KRing od the Teetotalers," as the picture WalS oalled, but all the rest of the fuxnituxo iatht iomr,

In this case the Court of Qaeen's Bench, in fichaebmas term last, had grAnted leave to file a criminal informatiou against the defendant, Charles William Gregory, charging him with the publication of a libel imputing to his late partners, W.

by means of the Court of Chancery. The defendant pleaded the general issue.
Sir F. TaxSIGER Was in the act of opening the case to the jury,when

The train was due at Conway at 11-45, and at Bangor, whichis 14miles from Conway, at 12-10; but it seems on the night in question it left Conway five minutes late. Within from 16 to 1S minutes before the mail-train left Conway a coal and cattle-train, drawn by two engines, had been despatched from Conway, and it Was by overtaking and running into this train that the accident happened. The mailtrain travelled at 35 miles per hour, and the regulation speed of the cattle-train was 20 miles per hour; bnt one of the engines of the latter failed shortly after passing Aber. Instead of stopping and giving dfgnals, according to the regulations, or shunting, the cattle-train continued to go on ata diminished velocity, and at the entrance of n tunnel about two nfles fromi 13angor the collision occurred. Under these circumstances the negligence was attributed to the company. The head of the plaintiff, who was sitting on a desk in the van, reading, was struck against some boxes fixed at the side, and the injuries from this blov woere very remarkable in their consequences. It appeared that the Post-office mail gnard, who was in the van atthe tinie with the plaintiff, fell with his head into some letter-bags, and cut his fingers on some string, and the plaintiff at the time so slightly felt the effects of the blow that he assisted the guard up, and the occasion was the cause of same jocularity, and the plaintiff afterwards walked round the train with the guard. The 10th of May was a Saturday, and on the following Monday the plaintiff felt a lightness in the head and depression, and a medical gentleman, Mr. Joce, rave him a certificate to forward to the Post-office. On the Tuesday, contrary to Mr. Joce's advice, he went to Holyhead as usual; but on Wednesday, the 14th of May, hefound it necessary to send for a Mr. Dickens to perform his duties for him. On the 16th of May the plaintiff consulted Dr. Gully at Malvern, and some time afterwards symptoms, attributed by the evidence for the plaintiff to concussion of the brain at the time of the accident, ensued. It seemed that the spine was injured. The plaintiff suffered great pain there, and lost power in the lower parts; he lost his memory; the urinary and other organs were grievously affected. He had never been so affected before. After being some time at Malvern the head symptoms abated, but not those in the lower part of the spine. Since the accident he had been paid 2501. by the Railway Passengers' Insurance-office. Ile had a life polcy previously effected in the United Kingdom-office, and had applied for a fresh policy; hut, on account of the effects of the accdent upon his health, that offiee had now refused to insure his life.
On cross-examination the plaintiff said the accident was on the 10th of May. He made no compliint to the company till October. Mr. Joce is a homccopatbist. Mr. Gully is a hydropathist.
PIe-examined.-His memory was uncertain stilL
Mr. Joce stated, on examination for the plaintiff,-I am a member of the College of Surgeons, a student of Abernethy's, and practice homemopatby. I was consulted on the 12th of May. He told me had received a blow on the head in a railway carriage. I thought I saw confusion in his ideas. There may be concussion of the brain without any appearance of external injuries. I cannot say I recommended, but I had no objection to his fgoing to Dr. Gully's, and he went of his own choice.
Cross-examined.-I attended Dr. Abernethy's lectures. I gave the plaintiff arnica montana.
Dr. Gully.-I have been for 14 years proprietor of a hydropathic establishment at Malvern. The plaintiff was brought to me on tbe 1Gth of February. He suffered great pain at the hack of the head and a feeling of distention and fullness there, giddiness, pain inthe neck,land down the arm, almost sleeplessness. In the lower regions- frequent pas sage of wrater, comnplete incapacity of holding the fieces, and his general condition WDS one of extreme depression. His memory was affected from the beginning. It was nearly three months before he got his proper sleep; the giddiness diminished in four or five weeks. I have no doubt these symutoms resulted from a blow at the base of the skull. I don'tthink he will ever bear active work, and the lower organs are very weak still. I think these are the results of an Injury to the spinal cord. He has been under my care since May last, and is not now fit to resume his duties as before. In the first instance I applied warm hip-baths, with mustard, and cold and applications to the head, fomentations of warm water to thestomach where the symptoms weromostdistressing. There w7as, especially on the left side, a shrinking of the lmbs, resulting from a diminished flow of nervous power from the brain.
Cross-examinaed.-The plaintiff rays me four guineas per week. He boarded with me, andI keep an appropriate table. (Aletter of the 3d of August was here put in from the witness to MIr. Holt, stating that the extremities of the spinal cord had received a severe shock, and that exertion and letter-writing were all but impossible.)
Dr. Hassell proved that the pliuntiff had, previous to November a policy for 1,000. with the United Kingdom Lifeofflice, but that on hisi application to renew it, subsequent to November, he had recommended the office to decline the life, on the ground that the plaintiff was still sufferng from paralysis.
Mr. wells, surgeon and lecturer of the anatomical school connected with St. George's Hospital, proved that he wa consulted by and exanmined.the plaintiff,and that he observed the shrinking of the limbs on the left side, which, he said, is a symptom of injury to tho spinal cord. It was difficult to say whether he would ever recover. It was a doubtful case. The symptoms he had desemibed with reference to difficulty of retention and loss of powerwere consistent with a blow on the base of the skull. They were such as to caase anxiety.
Cross-examined.-It was at the end of November I examined hm, and I should think the shrinking existed in October. The shrinking now is entirely removed.
Dr. Lewis, a bachelor of mediCine ad medical officer of the 1ost-offlce, having been examined for the plaintiff
ir. Serjeant BYvnES.-Cau you recollect a case where serious injuries of this kind have come on within 12 hours or so, when nothing was apparent at the time of the
The witness was understood to state a case of the kind within his experience.
Mrs. Booth stated that on taking the plaintiff in his breakfast on the Sunday morning she observed that he appeared depressed; he seemed to have a headache, and to suffer from oppression over the eyes.
Mr. Solly, surgeon of St. Thonmass and 31 years connected with t-he hospital, stated thaLt a concussionL of the brain not serious at first, where the patient has been little more than shaken, wih sometimes become very serious, and in three weeks or a month loss of memory, twichings, and trembling of the limbs will ensue. Shrinking of the limbs was the result of the hmbs not being used, from paralysis. Such symptoms might result where the patient has not been rendered insensible by the blow.
The plaintiff being recalled, said he wrote some letters in August; that he was assisted in writing them by gentlemen in MIr. Gully's establishment.
This was the plaintiff's case.
Xr. Serjeant BYli,g for thedefenee, would address a fow remarks in behalf of the directors of the company. Whenever an accident happens a railway is besieged by applications; sometimes the injuries are serious sometimes imaginary. When the jury had heard the de'fcndants' evidence he thought this case would assume a very different complexion, and he asked them neither to express nor form an opinion tiU both sides had been heard. Ist, was there negligence; 2d, what should be the compensation ? As to the facts oat of which the charge of neligenc -lose, there would be little conflict of evidence. a no accidt had happened tothe coal train it would have arrived safely at Bangoand no accident vould have occurred. Was there reasonable ground for believing that with two engines it would reach iBangor without belag overtaken? InI general 15 minutes is a reasonable time within which to despatch one train before another. The jury were to divest theirminds of prejudioe, and treat tho defendants, not as a company, but a individuals. He would call the mail guard who was with the plaintif; who would p rovo that, the tPlaintiff at the time had apparently uffered no injury. tot one of the other paeaecgers sffereda bruise,ana the p Isiatiff wa the only one wlho. months aftnrwarda~ made a claim aginst the company.

tion to the rest of the passongers. N'either he nor any of the passengers or carriages suffered any injury.
Oe did not dispute that without any extetnal manifestation the brain might be injurtd, but he was instructed that such injury as this could not result tvithout some symptoms supervening, either contemporaneously or shortly afterwards. He world call Mr. Arnott
and Mr. Lawrence, and other eminent gentlemen, who I would say that such was the case. He wenlld call Mr. Holt.
This writ was issued on the 22d of Novenmber. As to Dr. I Bassell's evidence of iis refusal to accept the life assurance in October, the effect of it was only to show that a man might, by dieclosiug all his bad symptoms, obtain a refusal from an insurance-office. With reference to the evidence of Dr. Gully, with the exception of the shrinking of the limbs, he caUed,their attention to the fact that his evidience showed all the symptoms were symptonis which 'were described by the plaintiff to Dr. Cully. He (the learned counsel) did not dispute that gentleman's evidence; but it was given upon the representations of the plaintiff. The letter of the phintiff on the 3d of August was weU ex. pressed, the penmanship perfect; and this was the letter 'written by a man represented to be all but incapable of wriung a letter. There was this letter and others. They 'wonid show, not osity that he could write and compose wel at that time, but that he represented to Dr. Gully that he could net.
Wilhiams, guard of tho mail-train, said he did not feel much of a shock. He got down and saw Alen, who got down too. Allen spoke to witness, and told him he could not help laughing, and made no complaint about himself. He waLced round the train with 'witness.
Brereton, the Post-office mail-guard with the plaintiff at the time of the accident, stated-I fell under the desk and he got down and assisted me up. I was fainting at the time. He smiled and was laughing. 1 was shaken by the fall. Allen laughed, but I did not see him do so more than once.
Cross-examined.-I feU with much violence, and told a gentleman that, if I had not faUen wvith my head on the sacks, I should have been kiled. He did not appear at the time to be seriously injured.
Dr. M'Eiven, a physician at Chester, stated that he went to see Allen four months afterwards at Malvern, when he walked in such a way that the witness could observe no impediment; that on examination he appeared to possess senssbshty,sthe skin, showsed no shrinking of the muscles, and 'was apttly in full health, and appeared not to have suffered'tUu-y to the brain or spinal cord; and that Allen stated he had never been a single day in bed since the accdenmt.
Cross-examined.-I know Mr. Ferguson.
By Mr. JAMES.-Does it sometimes happen that in cases of concussion of the brain symptonas will not appear tiUl some time after the accident ?-I think that is impossible. In my experience concussions which are slight invariably get 'well.
To the CinEF JUSTICE.-The symptoms described by Dr. Gully, frequent micturation, and senminal weakness, are not, in my opinion, symptoms of concussion of the brain. I have seen afew eases for the company, but am not specialy retained.
To the Cnmna JusTICE.-I am surgeon to the prison hospital at Chester.
Mr. lLaw.rence, the surgeon.-As the result of my experience,I never met-withacase of serious concussion of thebrain where there were not contemporaneous indications, or following shortly after. I have seen the cases in Bartholomews Hospital for more than half a century. If the functions of the body are well performed and muscles unimpaired, I should say there was no disease to the brain or .spinal cord. In a case where the symptoms are as described by Dr. Gully I should expect to find external appearances. I have seen the letters (meaning the letters written by the
plaintiff in August), and can see i them indications of free~om from any defect in the cerebral functions. I do not consider hydropathy a remedy for injuries to the brain or spine. I thought the plaintiff stepped nimbly into the 'witness-box.
Cross-examined.-A concusson of the brain, attended with apparently slight symptoms at first, might, under peculiar circumstances, be followed by serious symptoms subsequently. The effect of disease to the spinal cord is to cause retention. In disease of the brain and sPinal cord all parts of the body suffer. There may he inability to retain foxces. I should not be surprised at restlessness and sleeplessness accompanying loss of memory and confusion of ideas. I don t think this gentleman had a concussion of the brain. I knew he had beon under Dr. Gully If he was a httle out of sorts he was right to go to Malvern.
The CHIEF JusTicz.-If a man cannot retain his foaces, or his urine, would you call that being a little out of sorts ?
Mr. Ferguson, the surgeon.-In my experience, which has been considerable in concussions of the brain, there are symptoms at the time. Insensibility is one of the first s3 mptoms, and inability to move. I have known confusion of the brain to come on sometimes within a few hours; sometimes a few days afterwards. I have not known such symptoms as Dr. Gully has described to supervene subsequently. Inability to pass water is one of the symptoms.
saw th plaintiff on the 16th and 21st of January. I examined him. I did not perceive then any physical indications of concussion. The plaintiff did not then, and does not now, appear to suffer from concussion.
Cross-examined.-I was examined in the case of " Bailey v. the Great Northern Company." If a patient came to me and said hehad suffered a blow, and 10 days afterwards complained of loss of memory and confusion, I should attribute it to the concussion. [Mr. James then put several questions to the witness, framed with reference to his statements at the tral in " Bailey v. The Great Northern," as reported in T'Ie Times of Dec. 2, 1856: a copy of which the learned counsel held in his hand.] In that case Mr. Bailey had been in a boat after the accident.
By the CEHinF JuSTiCE.-No other cause than that ascrnbed by the medical witnesses called for the plaintiff bein assigned to account for the symptoma in this case,
should you say that 'was the canse ?-I should.
Re-examined.-I adhere to my opinion that I should expect from such symptoms to find indications at the
Mr. Arnott, tho surgeon.-Speaking from my experierce as a surgeon at Mfiddlesex Hospital for 20years I do not recognize, surgically, a concussion of the brain by symptoms not appearing at the time. In my experience the power of expulsion is wanting when there is concussion, and also inability to retain the faces. It seems to me there was injury, but not serious. It is not in my experience to find such serious symptoms supervene. The letters seem very well written, and appear so far as the writing well written.
By the CHIEF JUSTICE.-From all you have heard of the case do you think he will permanently recover ?-I don't think there is any serious mischief of the brain now. That there was Injury I have no doubt. It is a natural, or at least a common occurrence for a person whose brain is slightly injured to fancy As is seriously injured
Cross-examined.-An injury to the brain is a delicate subject.
Mr. Holt cross-examined.-I do not doubt that this gentleman received a slight injury to the brain. The Accident Insurance Company paid the plaintiff 2501., instead of 1001., 'which I adlvised.
After the summing up for the defendant,
Mr. JEis replied.-His friend could not be sanguine in expecting a verdict. He ventured to think the company would have been betterable togive an accountto theirshare. holders if, instead of putting them to the cost of all these expensive medical witnesses, and making this court an arena for attacking the system of Dr. Gully, they had applied some of the funds at their disposal in properly compensating the plaintiff. The plaintiff had acted conscientiously throughout in his claim against the company; and was as little hliely as any director of the company to exaggerate his symptoms in the manner and for the purpose imputed to him by Mr. Serjeant Byles, or to be guilty of the conduct insinuated-of getting his life refused by Dr. Hassell for the purposes of this action. To make such charges was not a fair wav of conducting a case of this description on the part of a public company. If the jury believed that the life had been refused, was it nothing for a young mLn of 32 years to be so disabled by an accident as to find his life uninsurable?
The CHIEF JUSTICE, In summing up, told the jury tbe questions were, did the plaintiff receive any injury from the collision ? and, if he did, did that proceed from negligence? The medical gentlemen called for the defendants admitted there was some injury, although differing as to the degree. It had been said it was the constant practice on railways to start trains one 15 minutes after the other,as these had been. If that 'was so, it might be said it was necessitated by the traffic; but, as a matter of common sense, he for one 'would be sorry to be a passenger. But here it did not appear there was any necessity for starting the passenger train so shortly after the other. Goods trains were the frequent cause of accidents in this way. Was not this conduct on the part of the company's servants, causing unnecessary dangero passengers, negligence? When the goods trainmwas incapacitated it was not stopped. No man was sent in advance to signal. Was this negligence leading to the accident? Ifthe jury believed that the plaintiff did make exaggerated and untruthful representations to Dr. Gully for the purpose of deceiving him they would dismiss the case. If they did not so believe, a charge more scandalously disereditable to a public company he could not conceive. t was a charge that the plaintiff was the concoctor of an abominable fraud, for the purpose of making an exorbitant demand. He never saw a case put forward 'with less desire to exaggerate. As to the injury being temporary or permanenttbhe jury must exercise their judgment. It was proverbial that doctors disagreed, and experience showed that they never did so more than in eourts of law.
lTue Plantiff's letters vvere then handed to. the jury, who retired at 6 o'clock to consider their verdict. They returned in half an hour. and found their verdict for the plaintiffDamages, 1,4001.
SECOND COURT.
(Sitt'ins At N&is PiusW, befor-e Ar?: JUSUC WILLES and
Common Jrlsres.)
PRIEST V. HEATH.
Mr. Serjeant Kinglake and Mr. Horace Lloyd were counEel for the plaintiff; P[r. Serjeant Thomas appeared for the defendant.
This was an action for false imprisonment, the particulars of which 'were as follows:
The laintiff, a boy of 16, was the son of a cowkeeper and mlahman, carrying on his business at Wandswortb, and the defendant carried on a similar business at the same place. The plaintiff's father and the defendant also oconpined o n of a piece of land lying a short distance from the righway, and separated therefrom by a naow road On Friday, December the 19tb, tbeplactiff took by faternse
horbe and cart'with a load Of manure, which he spread on his father's ortion of the land, and on his return met the defendan's servant, a lad of 16, in charge of a horse and cart 4qa&ded with manure, on the road from the highway into Ihe piece of land, and 'which had stuck fast in the road. -nd pased defen'ant's boy, and afterwards, at his request, retuned to him to help him in extricating defendant's horse and cart. Several methods 'were tried, all more or less injudicious, by joint consenit of the twc, and at last, plaintiff having advanced his cart and horse ahead of the defendant's, and mnade fast a halter to the month of the defendant's horse and the other end to the tail-beard of plaintiff's cart, the plaintiff attemnpted to lead his horse on, and defendant's horse, resisting the pull uponl 'him, threw his head away, and a portion of his tongue was in some niafiner o-dt off, and fell to the ground. The horse
was of small value, and had, it appeared, recovered from the accident. It was not contended that the accident had bappened from any malicious feeling on the part of the plain-
tjf, but, on the contrary,thatplaintiffhad acted to the best of his judgmentfor the benefit of the defendant, On tho evening, however, of the next day the plaintiff was taken to the station-house, and charged under 7th and 5th of George IV., cap. 30, section 16, with malicious damage to the plaintiff's horse. Bail was taken for his appearance on the Monday following, and upon the case being heard before M.r Ingham, the magistrate, the cbarge was dismissed.
Mr. Justice *VILLES, in summing up, said it was clear that the defendant had set the law in motion against the plaintiff, and that his so doing was unjustifiable. In charging the plaintiff as he did he was bound, as a private person, to show that a felony had been committed, and that there was reasooable and probable cause to suppose the plaintiff guilty of it. In this case no felony, either at common law or by statute, had been comnitted, and if defendant had applied for awarrant against the plaintiff, as he fer"tand oug t to have done, the magistrato would have lot ed at the matter, and in all probability refusedthe warrant.
Verdict for the plaintiff-Damages, 101.
PAXTON AND ANOTBER V. BHAEKER.
Mr. Hugh Hill, Q.C., and Mr. Barnard were counsel for the plaintiffs, and Mr. Digby Seymour for the defendant.
This was an action brought by the owners of a billyboy called the Lucksall against the owners of a brig called the Annandale for an in ury committed by the latter in running down a boat belonging to and attached to the former, as both vessels were leaving the West India Docks, on the 22d of September last.
it appeared from the evidence of the plaintiffs' witnesses that both vessels left together, the brig baving discharged her cargo, and the billyboy having loaded previous to sailing for Antwerp. The brig had her anchor with the ftuke awash-that is to say, justoutof the water, which was shown to be a very dangerous and careless mode of stowing the anchor, and directly contrary to the rules of the port of London. One of her sails were set, and several others flying, but not sheeted home. The billyboy and brig were both m the lock together, and the biUlyboy came out first, at about noon, the tide then running up, and the wind very strong from the south-west. She had then her boat attached to the stern by a painter or rope, and as she came out ;he had a check rope of her own made fasttothopier-head, attachedtoher larboard bow, in orderto throw her head to the left in entering the river. The brig followed her close, and instead of clearing her made across the river, and having some way upon her, owiing to the fresh breeze and her light condition, she went foul of the plaintiffs' boat, ran the fluke of her anchor through her, crushed her, and carried her away. It appeared that the wife of the master had hauled at the boat's painter to try to prevent the accident, but it was denied that this had anything to do with causing the accident.
ThomasWorsell, the dockmaster, was also called, who said that the rule of the dock was that vessels were no longer under the charge of the dockmaster when clear of the outer dock-gates, and that, when so clear, ships going out were bound to use their own ropes; that he witnesspd the accident, which happened about 650 feet beyond the gates, and that, in his opimon, the accident would not have happened had the brig's anchor been otherwise stowed.
For the defendant it was contended that the accident could not be attributed to the brig having her anchor fluke "awash," as in any other position the accident would have happened from the force of the collision alone; that the accidcnt miglht fairly be attributed to the wife of the master of the biUyboy having hauled at the boat ; but that the primary and principal cause of the accident was the negligence of the dock servants, who ought to have held on the check rope belonging to the Dock Company after the vessel had left the dock gates.
The witnesses for the defendant proved that the lbrig, while in the dock, was secured by the starboard and larboard bow by check ropes belonging to the com any, and that on entering the river the brig's master and the waterman then in charge of her caled out to the dock servants to hrid on the larboard rope; but that they disobeyed these orders, and told the crew of the brig to cast off, which they were ultimately obliged to do, and that this was the cause of the accident. Some also gave it as their opinion that the position of the anchor had nothing to do with the accident; and it was also said that the accident would not have occurred but for the iwife of the master of the billyboy hauling at the rope.
Mr. Justice WanEs summed up the evidence, caUling the attention of the jury to the several points made by the defence, and left it to them to say to whom the accident was imputable.
The jury gave a verdict for the plaintiff-Damages, 101. 9s.
Insolvent Debtors' Court, Feb. 18.
I.VSOLVENT DEBTORS' COURT, Feb. 18.
1N RE FREDERICK DUIMARESO ROSS.
(Before Mfr. Commi.ioner MtrrRprv-A
Tms msolvent, 23 years of age, petitioned under the Protection Act.
Air. Reed opposed for a creditor named Linfield, and Miss Myers, another creditor, appeared in person. Mr. Sargood supported.
The insolvent, who is tho son of an officer in the army, but whose parents are dead, was a student at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. On the 29th of April, 1855, he came into possession of a sumn of 1,8381.under his father's will, the whole of which had nowdisappeared, and he remaitied 1101. in debt to various creditors in the schedule. In a Deriod of 18 months, from April, 1855, to October, 1856, he Ead expended 6001. in gifts to women, 1501. in wearing apparel, 501. in jewelry, most of which he had given away as presents, 1001. in travelliUn expenses, and 1501. in payments for admission to vaxious places of amusement.
Miss Myers complained that the insolvent had borrowed 91. of her upon a promise of speedy repayment, and had also incurre a debt of upwards of 51. for cigars.
Mr. SAI:GOOD suggested that Miss Myers should reserve her complaint until the next occasion, should it be necessary for her to continue any opposition, which he trusted would not be the case.
Mr. Liniield, a beershop-keeper at Brighton, was a creditor for 45., including 34g. 6s. money lent. He statedthat he had known the insolvent for several years as an occasional customer, and had received prior to November, 1855, about 151., including 101. paid at that time. The insolvent then lodged at his house, and a few days after the payment of the 101. in November he borrowed 81. l0s., which, together with a previous advance of 11. 10s., be promised to remit by check on his return to London. That promise was not kept, but the creditor did not make any complaint, and uponi the insolvent revisiting Brighton he made other advances, which, together with his bill for lodgg, goods s-
lied, and money paid, amounted to the debt now due. In Vlebruary the insolvent left Brighton with the expressed in. tention of indulging in a little shooting. After a few days spent in that pastime the insolvent entertained a notion of going to Australia, and actually paid 63b for his paasage and 301. for an outfit, but, sfodry cbanging his mind, he was compelled to forfeit one-half of the passage-money he had paid. He then returned to Brighton, but did not inform Mr. Linfield of his abandoned idea of quitting Eng land; and in April he left Br:ghton for London, where he remained until November last, when he went to a relative at Tunbridge-wells, being then very ill. The creditor wrote two letters, and, not being paid, went to Tunbridge-wels, when an offer of 8s. in the pound was made and refused. An action was commenced in December, and a judgment obtained on the 24th of June, and on the 26th the insolvent filed his petition in this court.
Mr. REED complained that the insolvent had not paid Mr. Linfield's debt when he had ample means of so doing, and showed from the schedule that since leaving Brighton he had actually got rid of no less than 3301.
Mr. Commissioner MUSRPHY repeated a suggestion which he had previously made, to the effect that probably the in-
terests of all parties would be best consulted by allowing the matter to stand over until another occasion, and during the interval the parties could consult.
Mr. REED, having previously dechned to adopt the suggestion of the Court, now said he was willing to allow the mnatter to stand over until another day.
Mr. SARCOOD, however, preferred going on, as the exposure which it had been the object to avoid had now taken place
Mr. REED then charged the insolvent with having contracted Mr. Linfield's debt with " gross and culpable negligence," which, according to the preamble of the Protection Act, disentitled him to the benefit of the statute. The learned counsel also contended that the insolvent had made away with his property by expending it in the manner he bad, imstead of hquidating the just demand of Mr. Linfield. It was also a grave question whether such a case was contemplated by the Legislature in passing the Protection Act, and, if the Court should be of opinion that it was not a fit case for the benefit of the act, the petition must be dismissed.
Mr. Commissioner MimRny held that there was no fraud proved so as to make out a case of that kind; fraud must be shown to exist in the inception of the debt, which had not been the case with Mr. Linfield's debt, and subsequent acts would not confer the character of fraud upon a debt already incurred. Neither could it be said that there had been gross or culpable negligence. Such terms would apply to the case of a man who entered into business with little or no capital, and, recklessly taking credit on all sides, incurred thousands of pounds of debt without any means of meeting it. Mr. Linfield had, no doubt, been injured to some extent, but it must be remembered that the young man bad also been injured and his family annoyed by the detailed examination into his weaknesses and follies. The creditor was entitled to complain as to the 81. 10s. which he had lent upon a promise of repayment by check from London, but that promise having been broken, and the creditor having chosen notwithstanding to make further advances and give further credit, he could not now make any complaint in respect of those latter advances. As br. Linfield had established a complaint so far as 81. 10s. the Court must refuse to continue protection, but, having regard to the smallness of the amount, the insolvent would be permitted to come up for a protecting order in a correspond. ingly brief period of time.
The case was then adjourned sine die, without protection.
IN RE JAnsES ROGERS.
This insolvent, the comedian at the Olympic Theatre, whose name has become somewhat familiar to the public by a recent occurrence, applied under the Proteotion Act, and was not opposed. The debts are only 1031., and the insolvency is attributed to the death of his late wife, his own occasional illness, and insufficiency of income. His present salary at the Olympic Theatre is 41. per week.
The 13th of MIarch was appointed for granting the final order, and the protection was renewed until that date.

MIDDLESEX SESSIONS, Wednesday, Feb. 18.
MADDrZSBX SESSIO2) , Wedncvaday, Feb. 18.
(Before Mr.PASL, Q.C., Asan.-.Tudge-)
Frederick Goodwin, a boy 11 years of age, was brought into court to surrenderto answer a charge of having unlawfully and wilfully thrown part of a brick in a manner to endanger the safety of passeDgers on the London abd NorthWestern Railway. Bepleaded "Guilty."
Mr. GTsFARD, for the prosecution, said the offence was committed at the north end of Primrose-hill tunnel, and it bad been of such frequent occurrence that twvo detectives were especially employed to watch for the offenders, and the prisoner was seen to oommit the act charged against him in the indictment.
It appeared from the evidence in the depositions, that in consequence of instructions received from Mr. Beresford, the superintendent of the police at Euston-square, Gwynn, one of the detestives, lecpt watch at the frat bridge at the north end of Primrose-hill tunnel, and on the afternoon of tbe lth of January, about 35 mninutes past 3 o'clock, he saw the prisoner climb up the pasapet, and put part of a brick upon it; he leaned forward so as to look on the line. An express train was then passing under the bridge, and the prisoner threw the piece of brick at it, It was thrown just as the engine was going under the bridge, and might have struck the driver, stoker, or guard. The prisoner leaped off the parapet, and the officer immediately took him into custody, when he said it was the first time he had done such a thing-he was very sorry for what he had done, and the brick bad not struck the train. A piece of brick was afterwards found lying between the rails, and on the van of the express being examined at Euston station a mark was found on the off side, which it was believed was produced by the piece of brick striking it. The guard deposed to something striking his van as the train passed under the bridge.
Witnesses were called to give the boy a character for good conduct hitherto. His father was a very respectable man.
Sentence was deferred.
William Britton, 16, Alfred Wheeler, 16, and George Skinner, 16, were indicted for having stolen a gold watch and cham, a brooch, 300 cigars, and other articles, value 251., the property of John Marshfield, in his dwelling-house. Skinner was admitted Queen's evidence against the other pnsoners.
Mr. Cooper was counsel for the prosecution; Mr. J. P. Doyle appeared for Wheeler.
The prosecutor stated that he kept a beerhouse at No. 50, Cochrane-terrace, St. John's-wood, called the Sailor's .Return. On the night of the 6th of December he was the last to go to bed, and he took a candle and went round to see that the premises were all safe. They were. He was not disturbed during the night, and he came downstairs next morning about 7 o'clock with the potboy, a lad named Collins, when he found everything in confusion. The gas was lighted, it having been securel turned oft the previous night. Some empty Scotch ale ttles and half-smoked oigars were lying about, and three panes of glass had been broken in the door leading to the back yard. He found what was called an egg iron. A desk had been broken open, and on examining the place he missed a gold watch, chain, and seal, 300 cigars, two coats, a tablecloth, pair of boots, a gold broch, and other articles, value altogether about 25. He gave information to the police. IIe had iiecn the prisoners im the house. A watch now produced and a pair of shoes were his, and were part of the things nmissed on the night in question. The potman was not present; he had been unable to find
Henry Manners, painter, of 25, Cochrane-terrace, deposed that he was at t e prosecutor's house on the night in question, when the pnsoners came in with Skinner. They drank with Collins, the potboy. He went away about halfpast 10 o'clock, and left them there.
George Skinner, the approver, said.-I met Wheeler on the 6th of December, and he said he and William Britton were going to crack a crib the next week in Albemarlestreet. I lve at 2, Strait's-buildings, Mount-street, Grosvenor-square. Jzmes Collins, Mr. Marshfield's potboy, came down to Sprin-street, where I was with Wheeler, and he asked us to take a walk with him up to his master's house. When we got to St. John's-wood church Wheeler told Collins that he and Britton were going to do a crib, Collins asked me if I was going to have anything to do with it, and I said, "No." Britton usedto work at the place where the robbery was to be done. Collins said he thought he could make it right for us to crack his master's crib, and he asked me if I would make one in it. I said I would not. Wheeler then said, " Well, never mind- I can get Bill Britton to help me;" and they then agreed that Wheeler should bring Britton to his master's house that night at 9 o'clock. I and Wheeler then left Colins and went back to Spring-street, and after stopping a little while Wheeler asked me if I would go with him to where Britton lived, 101, East-street. We went there, and Wheeler called Britton
onu ann saia no nact got a crib to crack, and asked him if he would make one to do it. Britton asked where it was, and Wheeler told him it was where Collins was living-Mr. Marshfield's. Britton said, "AU right;" and he went back and fetched three chisels and this egg-iron. (Produced.) They both asked me to go with them, but I said if I did go I should have nothing to do with the robbery. We three of us then started off to MaIshfield's house. We got there about 10 minutes to 9. We had a pint of beer, and Collins drank with us. We stayed there. At about halt-past 10 Colins came into the ta proom, where we were, and asked Britton if he was ready, Britton said "Yes," and Collins took him out of the room and showed him upstairs, and concealed him under his bed. He then came back and asked Wheeler if he was ready. Wheeler said he was, and he took him to where he had concealed Britton. Collins then came back and asked me to have a game at cards with him, but I told him I didn't know how to play, and he said he would teach me. I sat down to play, when the "missusI came in and said she could not allow it, and it was time for us to go, as it was George's (Collins's) bedtime. I got up and went away soon after half-past 10. I went straight home and got there at 20 minutes past 1L I did not see the prisoners, or either of them, until 10 the next morning. They came and called me out. Both of them were smoking cigars. I asked Britton for one, which he gave me, and
heeler gave me two. They said they cracked the crib all right, and Wheeler said he had left his old boots in the house, and had come away with a good pair of Mr. Marsh. field's on his feet. In the evening I went up Springstreet, and met Wheeler with Samuel Moss. Moss hbd a undle. and I followed them a little way. Ress asked me where I was going; I sad with them, but he said I was not, and if I did not go back he would knock me down; so I turned back and waited in Spring-street. V. heeler came back and said they had sold a cloth coat for 8s., and an alpaca one for 4s. He said Britton had got Marshfield's gold watch, for which he had been offered 91., but he wouldn't take that, as it was not enough. He said Jem Colins got the watch out of his master's bedroom, and gave it to them-that Collins took them upstairs and hid them under his bed, and when all was quiet they robbed the house.
Cross-examined.-I had known Collins about 12 months. I did not know at first what they meant by "c racking a erib," but I soon found out that it meant housebreaking. I was in custody myself on this charge, and Collins was a witness against me. After that I gave my account of the case, and7 was made a witness. All I have said is trueevery word. I don't know where Colins is now.
Police-constable 3 C stated that on the morningpef the Ist of the year he was oe duty in Graften-street, Bond-street, when he saw the prisoners Britton and Wheeler loitering about. He asked them where they were going to. They said they were on their way home from the Victoria Theatre. He noticed something bulky about Britten's pocket, and asked him what it was, when he produced a bull's eye lantern trimmed ready for lighting. Be said he used it when he went out fishing early of a morning. Witness searched him, and found a chisel in his possession, also abox of lucifers. He took them to the station-house, and upon Wheeler found nine keys, and on Britton a gold watch (now produced and Identified by the prosecutor as that stolen from his house). Witness received information, from which be went to Mr. Mfarshfield's house, and on comparig marks on the desk and awardrobe wWhich hadnbe°enbroken open th found marks precisely corresponding with the chisel
MbIr. DOYLX contended that, stripped of the evidence of the accomplice, there was nothing m the case implicating
The prisoner Britten said he was not guilty, and that he had the watch found upon him from Collins, in exchange for his.
The jury found both prisoners Guilty.
It was stated by the police that Britten had worked at Hawkins's Hotel, in Albemarle-street, for about 18 months. Wheeler ;returned from sea about six months ago, and since then heand Britten had been constantly about the streets
A verdict of ZHot Guzilty was then taken as to the *pprover
who was properly admenished by the learned judge asth his future conduct.
Sentence deferred.
*Ann Shoesmnith, 20, and Elizs Johns, 27, were indicted for stealing a purse containing 5s. 6d. from the person of Emma Ilowling in the street.
Mr. Platt prosecuted; Mr. Metalfe was for the pisoner They were found Guilty, and a previous oonviction was proved against Shoesmith, and it being auspectedby the officers that the other prisoner was a ticket-of-leave woman sentence was deferred to allow of inquiry.
(Before Mr. CRBASY.)
Sarah Godfrey and Mary Fitzgerald were indicted for stealing a purse, containing four sovereigns and other moneys, from the person of John Williamson, an American. Fitzgerald was also indicted for receiving.
Mr. Gent was for the prosecution; Mr. Sleigh and Mr. Ribton for the prisoners;
After the evidence had been given, and the learned counsel had addressed the jury,
Both prisoners were Acquited,
George Freegrove, 36, was indicted for stealing in the dwelling-house of Emmanuel Grouse, a watch and two chains, value 221., his property.
Mr. T. Salter prosecuted; Mr. Metcalfe was counsel for the prisener.
It appeared from the evidence of Sarah Grouse, wife of the prosecutor, who keeps a trimming shop in South-row, Carnaby-street, that onthe 9th of January, in the afternoon, the prisoner came into the shop, where she was. Her husband had got into trouble, and was sentenced at the Old Bailey to 12 months' imprisonment. The prisoner -told her
e had been in Newgate too, and had been sent by her husband to see her; but he declined to say what he had been there for. A customer was in the shop, so she took him into the back parlour to hear what he had to say, when he told her he had been sent by her husband to see how she was going on. She said she was getting as good a living as she could, whereupon the prisoner said her husband supposed her valuable watch and chain were in pawn. Se said they were not, and he then asked her to show him the watch. She said she had no objection, and produced it from a cupboard. The prisoner looked at it and replaced it in a box in which it had been kept, which she put back into the cupboard. He called on several occasions afterwards, and on one of them he prevailed upon her to take a drop of brandy, and her mother was sent out for it. As the mother went out by the private door frs. Grouse noticed a man standing close to the door, and directly after she heard a noise in the parlour; but the prisoner had engaged her in conversation about her husband, and she did not -ftler
notice it. She heard the noise a second time, and on looling int6 the parlour she found the cupboard door open and her box of jewelry gone. The pa8sage-door leading from the parlour-door to the street.doorawas open, and on looking Into the street she saw the man whom she had noticed at the door walking quickly away. She then returned to the shop and collared the prisoner, saying he should not go away, as no one but he knew where her jewelry was kept, and it must have been stolen by some one who was his accom-
lie while he kept her in conversation, and a policeman eing called in she gave him into custody. Her mother gave corroborative evidence, and said that once when the prisoner left the shop he joined a man wviom she saw standsnot the private door when she went oat for the brandy.
MrrcP3ALs', in an able speech, argued that there was no evidence connecting the prisoner with the man who was supposed to have committed the robbery.
vThe jury found the prisoner Guilty, and a previous conviotion for larceny in a dwelling-house was put in against him.
Mfr. CREASY sentenced him to six years' penal servitude, remarking that a worse case could scarcely be conceived.
Emma Hatfield, a determined-looking woman, was indicted for unlawfully wonnding Thomas Chilmari and Samue Ballrd, two police-constables. It appeared that the prisoner was taken into custody for being drunk and disorderly, when she resisted violently, pulled a knife from hehr pocket, and wounded the constables who had her in

GUrsDaLUJ.-John Southermwood, a salesman and collector in the employ of Mr. Davis, a hayfactor, of Smithfield, was placed at the bar before Aldermxn Rosz, charged with embezzling various sums of money, amounting to about 2001., belonging to his Imlyr
MR. Eedpath app for the prosecution, and Mr. Lewis attnded on behalf of the prisoner.
Mr. Edward John Davis said he was a. hay salesman at , West Smithfld, and the prisoner had been in his service about 12 months. His duties were to make sales, collect orders and money, and to account daily for all amounts received during the day. In January last Mr. Jobnson, of Milton-street, paid the prisoner 3. ]5s. for a load of hay, which appeared by the books to have been sold for 3. s, but no part of that amount had been accounted for by the prisorter. He produtced a receipt, dated the 30th of January, 1857, in the prisoner's handwriting, for
Mr. Lewis said hewas notyetpreparedto meet the charge against his client, and he therefore applied for a remand, to afford time to go through the accounts.
Mr. Redpath said he had no objection to the course proposed by ICr. Lewis.
The prisoner was therefore remanded.
MARLuoRoUGHI-STREET.-From Mr. J. Locke, M.P., 101. for the poor-box.
MAIYLEBoNE.-Two young men, named Hogan and Hear, were brought up for re-examination, charged with a violent assault on Police-constable Thorpe, 363 A Division.
The complainant, who had two patches of adhesive plaister at the back of his head, said that on Tuesday evening, the 10th inst., a httle girl came to the station in John-street to request that a policeman should go to the houre of Mrs. AsThby, baker, at te corner of Horace-street. The sergeant on dutys D 22, directed him to go there. He went, accordingdto hi instructions, when he saw Mors. Ashby, who told him that a man had forcibly entered her shop and had taken a quartern loaf. He asked her to point out the man to him, wnich she was not able to do.
Mr. Baomentroen -Were there many persons present 9
Thorpe-Yes, Sir. There were about 70 in front of the house. A s there were so manty as to cause an obstruction, I endeavoured to induce them to go away. The prisoner Hogan refused to go; he kicked me and otherwise assaulted me, at the same time observing, " You can now takee msinto custody." I seized hold of him (Hogan. He resiced, and we both felL While I WaS on the ground I received two violent blows at the back of my head, which for a moment rendered me insensible. I, however, got up, and when I was on my feet a person observed to me, mThat iS the man (alluding to the other prisoner) who strck you." Iran after am, but inwa short thne w as compeled to give up the pursuit, aS I fell down from loss of blood.
A certificate was produced, and read by Mr. BRouGHTON, which wias to the effect that the complainant was still cnable to attend to his duties.
The complaintant added that when he got up there was a crowd of persons around him.
D 22, sergeant of police, stated that on the former examilnation a sailor swore that he Esaw HIear strike the offier, which blow is supposed to have been in'dicted by the off6cer's staff, which had been lost by him.
Theprisoners were again remanded for a week.
r. jxouJGOHNo observed that he took this coursein order to ve the palice an opportunity of bringing forward the sailor. He should Issue a summons for his attendance that day, and if he did not then attend he should issue a warrant to compel his attendance.
lr. Phillips, who for a period of about 24 years was clerk at this court, and who on a vacancy of the chief clerkship at Worship-street Police-court taking placereceived the appointment, has been nominated chief clerk at this court.
WESTMINSTER.-John Farthing and Charles Morton, alias Gibson, two well-dressed men, were re-examined charged with stealing 12 51. Bank of England notes.
The prosecutor, Mr. Charles Backman, who recently had a fortune left hime met the prisoners, with whom he was slightly acquaintea, at a publichouse at the west-end of the town, when in the course of conversation they proposed going to a ball at Barbican, and he consented to accompany them, before doing which, however, he said he must go to his house, 14, Ranelagh-grove, Pimlico, to get some money. The arty jumped into a cab and were driven thither, when Mr. Backman opened the street and parlonr doors with his keys, and in the presence of the prisoners took a 51.-note from a pocket-book, and placed the latter, containing 12 others, on a chair, where he left it, and having locked the parlour door after him retired with his companions to a publichouse in the neighbourhood; it is supposed that while standing there one of his companions adroitly extractedthe keys from his pocket, and, immediately returning to the prosecutor's house, stole the pocketbook, for Morton was missed for a few minutes, and a person closely resembling him was seen to unlock the street and parlour doors, and leave the place in two or three minutes, basides which the prosecutor subsequently found his keys in a different pocket from that he had placed them in. he party then went to the ball, but the prisoners soon left Mr. Backman there. On the following morning, when he returned home, he missed his money. At the time of the prisoners' capture, some days afterwards, they were found together, and three of the notes had then been paid into the Bank of England which bore Morton's endorsement in his name of Gibson. Threo others have since been received there, which, it is stated, can be shown to bear the hudwrting of Farthing.
Mr. P&'xrTEE refused to take bail for the accused, and remanded them.
WORSm1p-sTREET.-Thomas Facey and Thomas Potter were charged with the following robbery
Mfr. Sea'e, an omnibus proprietor in the neighbourhood of this court, was aroused at half-past 1 that morning by a noise in his stable-yard, and on looking out of a window saw the two prisoners stooping and apparently 3oling something up. He hastened down as fast as he could, and was just in time to catch them as they were going through his gates, where they flung down what they were carrying and took rapidly to their heels. He pursued them, crying out " Stop thief 1" and both prisoners, after a protracted chase, were secured and broughtback byseparate constables, Mr. Seale at once identifying them as the men he had seen in his yard, where, upon looking about, a quantity of lead, rolled up convenient for carriage, was dis: covered, while upon Facey was found a strong pocketknife weU ground and beveled at the point to render it fit for cutting away such an article. On examining the houses in the neighbourhood the projecting shopfront of a surgeon named J ones was thought to look different from usual, and on comparing the lead with the roof of it there could be no doubt it had been cut from there, and that gentleman stated that from what he had since learned the prisoners and others had concerted a plan to plunder his neighbours in a similarz manner. The robbery was the more vexatious as, though all leadwork was very expensive, the material fetched next to nothing as ol metal, and, as his loss was already considerable, he hoped the magistrate would decide the case sumnmarily, and save him further expense and inconvenience.
Mr. D'EsNcoURT, however, said he could not entertain such a proposition; this kind of offence had lately become so greatly on the increase that he was resolved to check it, if possible, by sending these cases to a jury, and, as it was a duty to prosecute in them, however inconvenient, he should bnd over the witnesses to attend, and the prisones would be comm'itted for triaL.
CLERKn.WELL.-Upwards of 150 unemployed mechanics and labourers assembled in front of this court to seek advice and assistance from MIr. TYRwnsTT. On the previous day a large number of persons of the same class were bountifully assisted with bread, by order of Mr. Corrie, when it was stated that the major part of them were starving with their familries, and directed to attend on the following morning (Wednesday) at St. Pancras Workhouse, when their wants would be attended to.
A decent intelligent man, who said his name was John Bryant, a house-painter, who had been chairman at a large meeting of the "unemployed mechanics," and in Agarfield, St. Pancras, attended on Tuesday as their representative, and explaned= to Mr. Corrie that they applied in a body at the workhouse, and were refused relief, but they were offered stone-breaking, which was an operation or employment unsuitable to skilful artisans, as it blistered their hands and rendered them unfit for work at their trades, and they could not earn anything like money enough to support themselves or families.
Mr. Birchmore, overseer of St. Pancras, 'was in attend. ance, and said persons could earn 13c. 6d. per week at stonebreaking.
Mr. Bryant now statedithat they had applied at the work. house that morning, pursuant to the suggestion of Mr. Corre hi'e i (. Bryant) having been deputed to accompany them to the workhouse. He attended with 150 poor men, when, contrary to their expectations, they were refused relief, and they proceeded in a body to this court in a peaceable manner to make knownL to his Worship their complaint. He (Mr. Bryant) had nade inouiries, the remit of which was that, instead of 13t. 6d. per week a man with a

Mr. TYRWHITT concurred and thought that painters:, w~tcmakrs~comositr; nd uchlike tradesmen withSofthand ougt no to be put to stonebreakig if riven y necssity o appy forrelief at the workhouse, it was unfit for them, and they oug~~tht t hve lghte wor to o. H sypahze rwt
than poor respectable tradesmen driven to distress, aDd who were willing to work. HEo had no power; he could not rule the p&rish, but could only recommend and quggest, He thought that a little modicum of relief to such persons for a short time, until they might get some employnent at their trades, would do no harm. It would be different with lazy, drunken persons who were able, but unwilhing to work. It was a rule that if they reccived anything from the ratepayers they must do some work for it; if not the rates would bo very heavy indeed. The persons employed at the parish were persons of discrimination, and might very easily, he thought, discover whether they were fit for the business of stonebreaking or not. Stout hardy men were more fit for that thau those persons with soft hands. A sailor could soon be found out through the appearance of his hands. He could easily suppose that the hands of persons such as painters, &c., would be blistered and shattered.
Mr. Bryant said that some of tho persons could not earn more than 1 ,d. and 2d. per day at stonebreaking, and he had one man in court with his hands blistered to prove what he said to be true. He produced this man, who exhibited his blistered hands, and said he could only earn lld. per day, and he was so fulU of pains on the folloving day that he was confined to his bed. Mr. Bryant said that there were men inside and outsido the court who had told him they were
treated so cruelly at the workhouse that they would rather be in a prison, He (Bryant) had called at the workhouse that morning, and they had no oakum to pick.
Mer.aL TYnw rr.-They certainly ought to provide maMr. Jallings, master of the ClerkenweeU Workhouse, suggested that the parish of Saint Pancras might employ housepainters to paint their workhouse.
Mr. Tywm'r said he had no power over the case. He could not continue to give them bread every day. The court was not a relieving-office. le could assure them that Mr. Birchmore's situation was not an enviable one; he was between two fires, and had not an easy task to perform with them. He could only send an officer with them to the workhouse. He had no authority. The officer would introduce them. He always found Mr. Birchmore very fair and liberal in his conduct.
The parties then left the court.
THA,3ms.-Thomas Ahearn, aged 50, a plumber, dwelling at No. 7, Salibury-place, Rhodeswell-road, Stepney, was charged with stealing 4s. 6d., the monevs of Thomas Tuck, of No. L, Rhodesawell-road, gencral dealer.
The prisoner, a strange saUlow-looking man, who appeared to be labouring under delirium tremens, and who stared wildly dmin the investigation, is a neighbour of the prosecutor. On tne previous afternoon Mr. Tuck left his shop for the purpose of going upstairs to speak to his vwife. Ho was absent about five minutes, and when he came downstairs he was surprised to see the prisoner staggering out of the sitting-room. Mr. Tuck asked hhn what he wanted, but the prisoner made no answer, and ran out of the shop. Mr. Tuck on entering the sitting-room missed from a table seven sixpences and a shilling which he had placed there before he went upstairs. The prisoner was immediately suspected, and Mr. Tuck went after him, and found him in theBen Jonson publichouse, close by, stupidly drunk. The prosecutor charged him with stealing tho silver off the table, which the prisoner denied. A policeman named Kay was called in, and took the prisoner into custody. Kay asked the prisoner if he had got any money about him, to-which he replied, "I have got plenty of money of my own, but none of his." Kay took from him seven sixpeaces and three shilings in a purse, which the prisoner said was his own, but could not say how he obtained it.
Mr. Tuck was quite sure he left seven sixpences on his table in the sitting-room.
The prisoner, in defence, said he was too drunk to know what he was about. If he did take the money he had no recollection of it.
Mr. YARDLxy said the prisoner must answer the charge before a jury, and committed him for triaL
A respectable woman, a relative of the prisoner, said he was so much inebriated on the previous day that ho did not know what he was about.
Jr. YABDLEY said he did not wish to prejudge the case, but it was extraordinary as it was as clear. It was no palliation of the prisoner's offence to say that he was drunk when he did it. Society would be in a frightful condition if drunkenness were to be admitted as excuse for crime.
The prisoner's relative said he was an honest hard-working man, but very foolish when he got a drop of drink, and bhe really believed he did not recollect stealng the money. He took four beautiful chairs from his own home, and sold them for ess than a third of their value. His master would give him a good character.
MIr. YARDLE repeated that drunkenness was no excuse whatever. The prisoner appeared to be a strange and foosh man. Under all the circumstances he would take
The prisoner could not find bail, and was sent away in the police-van.
Mr. YARDTzy received a letter enclosing a check for 101. from Mr. J. H. Tolme, of No. 13, Duke-street, Westminster, who stated it to be a donation to the poor-box of the court from Mr. Joseph Locke, ALP., with a request that it might be acknowledged in The Times
SOUTHWABE.-Lichael Madden, a powerful-looking man in his shirt sleeves, which were besmeared with blood, WaS charged with being concerned with another, not in custody in breaking into the dwellinghouse of SamuelWarren cheesemonger, 1, Dean-street, Saint Thomas's, and stealng I therefrom a quantity of copper money and other property.
John Atkinson, police-constable 95 M, said he was on duty at a quarter to 4 that morning in Dean-street, near the London-bridge Railway Terminus, when he heard a noise inside the prosecutor's house. He remained at the door listening, when he heard a congreve match being lighted, and immediately afterwards he saw a light inside, and oould distinctly hear a noise similar to the breaking of wood. Witness immediately knocked at the door to call up the inmates, when he heard a shuffling noise of parties hurrying to the back of the house. He then went round into Saint Thomas's-street mews with. another constable, and saw the prisoner on the top of one of the walls, and another man in the proseoutor's yard. After that witness went into the house and exanmined it. He found that the entry had been effected by forcing up some of the bars of the iron grating, sufEicient to allow a man to descend to the lower part ot the house. The inner-door, leading to the shop, had been forced open, and the empty till was on the floor. In a waterbatt they found two 5s.-packots of coppers in an old handkerchief, and in the back yard a large screwdriver, which had been used to force open the door.
John Barton, 74 M, said he saw the prisoner on the wall of urosecutor's house, and another man rush out of the gate. Witness followed the prisoner over five walls into Joiner. street, where he lost sight of him for a moment, but ho afterwards captured him in Tooley-street. The blood on the prisoner's shirt sleeves was caused by climbing the walls and the resistance he made. His companion contrived to escape, but he thought he should be able to apprehend him in a few days.
Thomas Richards, a detective officer, in the employ of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway Company, said he resided at No. 11, Broadway, St. Thomas's, near thie terminus. His bedroom overlooked the prosecutor's back premises, and about half-pat 4 o'clock that morning he was roused by hearing a constable's rattle in the street. He got up and looked out of the window, when he saw two men on the prosecutor's wall, who climbed over to the fifth house. Witness then called out to them if they went any furtherhe wouldshootthem. One of thepolicemenaskedhim to fire at them, when the prisoners got out of the yard and ran off in different directions. He called out to the olice, telling them which way the men had gone. He believed the prisoner to be one of the men he saw on the walL
Mr. Samuel Warren stated that on the previous night, at ll o'clock, he fastened his house up, leaving ef erything safe in his shop, and at that time the grating was secure. In his till were four 5s.-packets of coppers, and about 3s. worth more loose. As soon as he was roused up by the police, at half-past 4 o'clock that morning.he went downstairs and found the inner door leading to the shop forced open, ana the empty till on the floor. WE missed then the four packets and the loose copper money. Shortly after he had admitted the police two of the packets were found in the water-butt, and the remainder were found on the prisoner by the police
Inspector Mackintosh said that he had no further evidence to offer that day. He asked for a remand, to enable them to find the other man.
Mr. Co=sA, having cautioned thelprisoner in the usual way, asked him whether he had anything to say.
ILhe prisoner said he was quite innocent of the charge, and among the copper money found on him was some silver belongg to himi.
lW. Co told him there could be no doubt that he was one of the parties who had committed the burglary; therefore he should remand him for a week.
The prisoner, who is well known to the police as a desperate character, was accordingly remanded.
Mr. Comz received a check for 101. from Mr. Joseph Locke, M.P., for the poor-box of this court, an acknowment of which was requested in the newspapers.

Soon after the commencemnent of the war in the Crimea the Diamond was ordered from Corfa to Balaklava, where she landed a portion of her seamen who rendered good service in the naval brigade, under Captaiu Peel, throughout the siege. In 1855 the command of the Diamond was given to Captain Hamilton, and on the ,conclusion of the war she proceeded to Athens, where she was stationed four months. She also made a second voyage to Corfu, and returned to Malta, which station she finally left for England on the 22d of December, having been unremittingly employed during the whole time she has been in commission.

Hospices On Barren Islands.
HOSPICES ON BARREN ISLANDS.
TO TRE EDITORt OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I have no desire to frustrate the attempt of Mr. Lang to erect hospices on barren islands, but now that the correct latitude and longitude of St. Paul's are mentioned in your impression of the 17th inst., I beg to offer a few re3marks which may be useful to him in carrying out his good intentions. I visited St. Paul's in 1S21, and have known many others who have also touched there. Speaking from my own experience as well as the testimony of other navigators, I should say that this singular island is not the place where a hospice is so much required as many other islands that I could name. My reasons for coming to this conclusion are as follows :-First, the island is not often without one or more inhabitants. English and American whalers are in the habit of leaving one or more of their crews up~on St. Paul's for the purpose of catching seals for their skins and oil, the ship piursulugher voyage to other seas for the grander object of killing whales. When the ship has fished and completed her cargo, which somnetimes eccupies a period of one or two years' duration, she returns homerwards, picking up the men she has left on the island sealing. That these men would make use of the stores left in the hospice for the benefit of any shipwrecked mnariners I, of course, do not pretend to say, butI leave thesolution of this problem to those who have visited suelt an intense solitude as this island, and found a convenient store of biscuit, cordials, and -other restoratives ready for immediate consumption.
In the next place, wheir I was there I found plenty of wid hogs upon the island, and vegetables were abundant, it having been the practice for navigators to sow and plant peas, beans, cabbages, and otber esculents for the benefit of ships passing that way. Whether the island is now a barren waste or not I know not, but it need not be if only a few of the vessels trading to our Australian colonies wonld occasionally stop there and do likewise.
But perhaps the chief reason why St. Paul's does not need a hospice is, that it possesses a natural and-unfailing s,upply of provisions, which seems to have been entirely forgotten hy those who advocate the erection of a hospice there. In is, as you are doubtless aware, a volcanic island, on the side of which tbere is a large and deep lagoon, evidently the crater of an exhausted burning mountain. One side of this circular basin is broken away, and through a narrow throat or entrance the sea ebbs and flows. The opening is about pistol-shot wide. In thislake, which isabout two miles in eiroumnfetnece, the water is as 8mooth as a milUpond. In rowinground this e.xhausted crater I found smoke rising amid Vie stoes on its beautiful beach in varicue places, and on landing I found the water close to 4he shore so hot theat I Kcould not bear my hand in it. The temperature of the air wae 73 deg. by thermometer, which, on being plungedinto the water, ascended to 200 deg., and on repeating the experiment in various places it rose to a similar elevation, and eveu to the boiling point. The lagoon is full of delicious fish, ,but I am ignorant of their nacaee; they appeared to me to be a species of haddock and cod, only larger, and are easily caught with a bit of red bunting, or piece of pork fastened to a hook. After catching a boatfull of fish, our party boilt d them in the springs anLd fouzd them excellent food. I should mention that there is a narrow belt of sea in the Ia ke, which may be styled, " No fishes water," where it is too hot for them, but it extends only a fe, v yards from the hot water, so that it is possibl.' for a man to catch a fhis in the bow of a moderat, y long whale "'at, and walk aft, and drop it into hot water and cook it. Viamming, the Dutch navigator, who visited St, Paul's in 16j7, mentions this fact, and if any of your reads Ts should feeldisposed to doubt the truth of this sta ement J beg to Jefertien to Horsburhgl's &ziling Directo-y to the Ea, t for a description of this remarkable lagoon. In addition to these authorities, I algo append my name and address, to vo ach for the truth of this einguJar fact.
I au. Sir, yours obedientlv.

The i loss under the agreement for working the traffic at 46 per cent. of the receipts amounted to 24,9121. in the first half and to 36,9081. in the second half of 1856, mahing together 61,8201. The gross earnings for the balf-year ending the 31st of December have been 717,8561., and the expenses 374,3331., leaving 343,5338. for division as follows:-Eastern Counties, 245,3741. ; Norfolk, 49,0741.; and Eastern Union, 49,0741. The 46 per cent. for working does not pay the expense incurred in obtaining this trafic, and the loss falls exclusively on the Eastern Counties shareholders. The net sum available for dividend from the half-year's working is 76,9711., after paying all guarantees and preference charges. To that sum is added 3,4661. from last account, making a total of 80,4381. available for dividend. The directors have declared a dividend of 5s. per share on the consolidated stock of the company, which wil amount to 72,9201., and leave 7,5181. for the next account. The mortgage debt on the 31stof December last amounts to 2,832,7731., showing an increase during the half-year of 108,S201. Of this *um 7,0121. was expended on new works for the associated companies, 8,3991. for new engines, and 38,6701. for new lines. In effect the real increase on the capital account, deducting the amount received from the sale of the cab stock, is only 9,3241. 9s., irrespective of the sum expended for new lines. The directors are of opinion that all sums expended for revenue purpose sought to be charged to revenue, and not to capital; the effect of this will be that the expenses incurred within the year will, as far as practicable, be borne by the receipts within the same period. and the enormous dead weight which has hitherto pressed so beavily on the shareholders, by the continual increase of the debenture intetest on capital so expended raised for revenue account wil be avoided, and advantages too manifest to require further comment will be obtained. They have opened a deposit account with their bankers, and are now receiving 5 per cent. for all moneys for which they have not immediate use, instead of 2 per cent., as heretofore. The directors have turned their attention, more especially since the last half-yearly meeting, to the consideration of how they could more effectuaUy conduct the business of the compauy, and at the same time reduce the expenses. With that view they have abolished theoffice of treasurer as being unnecessary, there being now no further occasion for sueh an office, and they have appointed a cashier instead, thereby effecting a saving in that department, greatly facilitating the business of the company, and exercising a snore efficient check over other departments in connexion with it. With regard to the accounts, the plan the directors purpose to adopt is this-the whole to be under the sole charge of a chief accountant, at the head-office, where one set of books properly kept by double entry will exhibit a perfect account of every monetary transaction of the company, and the accounts in all the other departmnents everywhere throughout the line will be subsidiary to and form part of the accounts at the head-office. In order to cause a rigid examination of every accoant before it is paid, the directors have determined upon having an office, under a committee of directors, to bs called the audit of accountsoffice, exclusively for this purpose, and they feel convinced it will be attended with very considerable advantage to the company. The directors have made several important changes in the iiternal adEinistrationoftheinternalaffairsofthecompany. They have abolished the officers' committee, which assumed to itself the functions of directors. The stores department has been remodelled, and the expense of district superintendents has been reduced from 1,7001. to 7001. a-year. After a minute examination, they found that the register of the shareholders was correct. The permanent way department has had the most anxious consideration of the directors. The total amount of renewals on the permanent way durmg the years 1855 and 1856 amounted on the Eastern Counties lines to 124,1621., on the Norfolk to 61,9721., on the Eastern Union to 4,4931., and on the East Anglian to 6Cs7L-total, 191,2351. The total expenditure on renewvals, after crediting the balance in hand on the 31st of December, 1854, 14,2401, and the proceeds of old rails sold, &-c., 10,2341., has been 166.7601., of which 14,0001. was charged to the capital account in the half-year ending the 31st of Decem-
er, 185a, 15,0001. was charged to the revenue account in the same half-year, and 25,0001. had been charged to revenue account in the half-year ending 31sb December, 1856, leaving abalance of 112,7601., now to be provided for. On a fornier occasion, when treating ot this subject, the directors were of opinion that one-third ahould be charged to capital account and two-thirds to revenue, but, after a careful reconsid,ration of the whole subject, and the suddenness with which the proprietors have been called upon to bear this extraordinary outlay, the directors are convinced that the proper and just course to adopt under the oircemstances, and having regard to the present and future interests of the shareholders is j to place this stm to a "Deferred Permanent Way Renewal Account," chargeable against revenue. It is of no use to attempt to place any portion of this sum against any other account, as, for instance, the capital, as it must be paid for out of revenue at present or deferred eventually. They therefore propose, instead of following the recommendation set forth in the August report, 1856, which was to charge revenue yearly with a sum of 15,0001., to increase that amount to the sum of 25,0001. annually, until thle whole amount is extinguished, which wiUl be effected in about five years and a-half. By adopting this course, and by carefuly watching the expenses in that branch of the service and reducing it whenever the opportunity wil permit, the directors expect the sum so set apart will not press heavily on the sharelolders, and it will be partially met by retrenchments in other departments. In consequence oftheverylarge outlay,thelineisnow in exceUlentworking order, which is evidenced bythe regularity with whichthe trains keep time. The company were unfortunately put to much inconvenience by the severe ilness of Mr. Bruff. This, however, was provided for in some measure by having obtained the assistance of Mr. samuel, who during a period of three nionths rendered very efficient services to the company. Since that time hlr. Bruff has resigned. The locomotive department is of great importance to the company. On the efficiency of the plant depend the regularity of the trains and their ability to carry the traffic brought over the line. Formerly when new engines were required it was too frequently the practice to place them to capital account under the plea that they were additions to stock, because the locomotive superintendent of that day had so certified, but the directors are decidedly of opinion that where now plant is required to replace old the cost should be defrayed out of revenue. It wiU be teen by reference to the locomotive expenses that seven engines. as well as sundry carriages, have been brought into use this half-year at a cost of 19,6251., and paid for out of revenue. The directors mention this as a proof of their desire to keep this department well supplied witn plant to carry on all its operations, In connexion with this department is the arrangement made with the lessees of the London, Tilburv. and Semth-A 1.n.
or worsing that iine. For the half-year ending the 31st of December, 1856, it will be seen that a loss of 2,2151. has been sustained, and this is nov pointed out to show how dangerous it is to snake such agreesaents, unless there be advantages of an unquestionable nature. The agreement was made under the advice and recommendation of Mr. Gooch as a profitgble one for the company. The claim of Mr. Gooch amounted to 7,8401. 14s. 8d., and it was agreed, acting under the advice of the company's solicitors, to pay him a sum of 6,0001. in full discharge af all his claims. The store department has also been attended to by the directors. Their object has been to avoid keeping a larger stock than absolutely necessary. The amount of stores issued in the half-year ending 31st of December, 1855, was 91,3151., ending 30th of June, 1856, 87,4261., and in the half-year ending 31st of December, 1856, 74,9211. This has arisen chiefly from the reduced price at wlhch the stores have been purchased. It is satisfactory to find, with an increased traffic and receipts, and seven additinnal stations, no increase in the cost, but a diminution. The stock taken on the 31st of December, 1856, by survey, and checked by persons unconnected with the departnient, amounted to 42 3521.
which is less than the stock on tbe 31st of December, 1855: by 17,0791., and on that of the 30th of June, 1856, by 6,3381. The question of passenger fares has pressed itself on the directors for some tinie past, more especially during the last six months; they found that the rates had not been fixed upon any settled principle-that they were at variance also with those charged by the other great metropolitan companies in consequence of making no distinction between th ) fares for express and ordinary passengers-that they were in another respect anomalous in regard w what are termed market tickets, making exceptions in favour of persons on particular days at a considerable loss to the company, b)y the issue of single tickets for the double journey -they tiserefore resolved to lay down a beiter trinciple for the future. First, to make a distinction
oetveen express and ordinary fares; secondly, to make the ordinary fares uniform; and, thirdly, by reducing the day tickets for first and second class passengers to a fare-and-ahalf, and abolishing altogether market tickets, which heretofore had been charged at a much lower rate. The directors contemplate considerable benefit to arise from this revision, as well as greater accommodation to the public. Hitherto a very bad system has prevailed in regard to season ticket holders, it having come to the knowledge of the directors that many persons were continually travelling without tickets, and without the right to traveL Tho revenue derivable from season tickets is upwards of 16,0001. per aunum, and the directors have the rates at present under revision, in order that hencefortis the charges mnay be based on a scale according to the dibtance overwhichs the ticket extends. The subject of free passes has also had the very serious consideration of the directors, and they have felt it their duty to withdraw all passes which had been given for other than business purposes i connexion with the company. Hitherto it has been the practice for several heads of departments to issue passes; this has now been put a stop to, and none are issued except those signed by the secretary. The foreign cattle traffic baying been brought under the notice of the directors it was shown that the rates from Lowestoft to London were 5s. to the railway company, a distance of 146 miles, while for siorter distances the rate was 12s. The directors deemed it ioecessary to put an end to this unequalas well as unprofitable arrangement, and have given notice thereof to the North of Europe Steam Naviga. tion Company. With regard to the coal traffli the directors are determined not to grant eiceptional rates, but to treat with all parties on a fair and, equal footng. The claims of the Northuniberland and Derham Coal Company have been entirely abandoned, and the Eastern Coqnties claim has been established to the extent of upwards of 11,0001. The capital account showed that 11,110,3231. had been received, and 10,996,098l. expended, leaving a balaneo of 114,225.
LONDON AND BL&CKWALLI
T half-yearly meeting of this com any was held on Tcehdai tt.eLondonTavem ; Mr. J. . Dauiell in the
*LDe refaro St" that the grow revenue for the WaJI-.eaT
ending the 31st of December last, with the balance of 110X. from tho previous account, amnounts to 45,1351., and theexpenditure to 18,9991., leavina a Iurpls of 26,1361. Fromt this the interest on debentures is deducted, leaving 19,3021., -vhich would enable the company to pay a dividend of 3s. 6d. per share. The increasein the passengertraffic as compared with the corresponding period of 185o amount, to 2,013A, and from other sources to 2,687/., making together 4,7011. There is an increase in the expenditure of 2e,458.
leaving the net inrea 2,2431. The agreement with the North London Railway Company provides for continu'mg the traffic upon its present basis for 2) years from July 1. 18.55, subject to determination by either company in 1868, the North London Company paying for terminal accommodation 500L a-year beyond the amount of toll originally charged them. The sum of 14,2674 had been expended on widening the line, making a total on that ac-
count of 337,656&, and it is estimated that 15,0001. more i vwll be required. The lessees of the Tilburg Railway and Victoria Docks have applied to the directors to encourage the trade by the erection of warehouses for the reception of their traffic. They proposed that the company Rhonld appropriate land at the Minories to the value of 16,0001. and expend 100,0001. in the purchase of land, the erection of warehouses and station accommodation, upon which outlay of 116,0001. the lessees would pay interest at 6 per cent. per annum for 20 years, and guarantee for thesametimeamenimtnmnet toll of 4,0001. a-year from the goods traffic passing overthe line. To raise the 100,0001. and the 60,0001. towards the balance due on capital the directorsrecommended the raising of 160,0001. by the issue of new shares of 51. los. each. The capital account showed that 1,581,1951. had been received, and 1,721,8361. expended, leaving a balance against the company of 140,6411. The revenue account for the halfyear ending December 31 showed that 45,0241. had been received and 18,9991. expended on works, leaving a balance, including 1101. from the former account, of 26,1361.
The C mesAs, in moving the adoption of the report, adverted to the former and present position of the company. They had expended 230,0001. in the extension and improvement of their lune, from which they now derived about 20,0001. per annum; that, he thought, was not a bad return on that outlay. The Eastern Counties were now showing a disposition to use their line for the short tragic. The lessees of the Tilbury Railway and Victoria Dock had offered them a guarantee of 6 per cent. on an outlay of 116,0001. to provide warehouse accommodation, which he recommended them to accept.
Mr. G. SMrrT moved an amendment, to the effect that the report be received, but that only that portion of it which related to the dividend be adopted.
A long discussion ensued, in which Mr. Tozer, Mr. Smith, and other shareholders took part, in the course of which the amendment was negatived by a large majority. The report was then adopted, and the dividend of 3s. 6d. per share declared.
After some opposition, resolutions approving the agreement with the North London Railway Company and for building the proposed warehouses were carried. The retiring directors and auditor were re-elected, and the proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the chairman.
SCINDE.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yesterday at Gresham-house, Old Broad-street, Mr.W. P. Andrew in the chair.
The report, an abstract of which has appeared in The Times, was taken as read,
The CHAIRMAN, in moving the adoption of the report, said they expected to have had official information before that time as to the line they were to take fer the railway, but the authorities in Bombay and Scindo had called upon them to make surveys in several directions not contemplated. This change in the arrangements by the local authorities had caused some delay, but he believed that remonstrances from the home authorities had been sent out to India, and he trusted the course of the line would soon be fixed as originally intended. They had sent out instructions to their engineer not to make any alteration in the line, because it was the best suited for the wants of the district and the purpose of extension. As to the harbour of Kurrachee, the Government had employed Mtr. J. Walker, the engineer, to report on its capabilities, and he had recommended the deepening of the water over the bar across the harbour, which could be effected at a moderate expense, so as to admit seagomng vessels of large tonnage to pass over it; and Mr. Walker stated that he hadno doubt, fromthe information he had obtained, thatit wonldmake an excellent harbour. A scientific geutle.nan, under Mr. Walker, had been sent out to superintend operations there, and he (the chairman) had hd!en recently informed that the dredging machines were at work deepening the bar. As an instance of the capabilities of the harboRr, one gentleman, who had expressed some distrust of laudipg stores at Kurrachee for the railway, had not only found on going there that he could land them safely, but had signified his desire to convey any other stores they might require to that port. They would have no difficulty in securing freights on moderate terms when the capabilities of the harbour were known. They had now a staff of engineers in the Punjab making surveys, and he had received a very interesting account of the navigation of the Indus up to Mooltan. The time at present occupied in transit from Kurrachee to Lahore was from 20 to 27 days, but when the railways were completed, and steamers suitable for the navigation were running between their termini, it could be performed in six days, He read paragraphs from the Indian newspapers to show that they approved bis plan for improving the communication from Kurrachee to Lahore and Umritsir. He was informed tb at there were no engineering difficulties whatever on the proposed Punjab Railhay; it was nearly a dead level the whole way, and it would no' have to cross a stream for three-fourths of the distance; but at the Mooltan end they would have to cross a few canals, The Punn b Railway would open up a larger country than Austria. 3He then adverted to the cotton districts to which access would be obtained, and stated that some very fine specimens of cotton had been produced in those districts from American seed, and that immense quantities of it could be grown in the distnct, and would come down the Indus to Kurrachee. Cotton had been growrn on the banks of the five great rivers in India from time immemoriaL It had been proved that iron mines existed in India to a great extent, and they were capable of producing all the iron that was required for the railways. Some of the ore was exceed. ingly rich. There was no possibility of getting cotton unless they made long railways, and they could not make them without a great deal of iron. The Euphrates, Scinde, and Punjab Railways would form three great links in the communication between Europe and Central India. Preparations were being made for la ing down the electric telegraph from the Persian Gulf to Kurrachee, and then to Join that system in India.
Mr. FRRRE, commissioner of Scinde, seconded the motion, and in doing so entered at considerable lengbh into the advantages of the undertaking in a commercial, political, and mllitary point of view. He had tak-en a great interest in the proposed communicatioh, and hoped that it would soon be carried out. He believed the plan proposed by Mr. Andrew was the best and cheapest that could be devised for opening communication with Hydrabad, Mooltan, Lahore, and Umritsir. It would form part of a general system of railways. Nothing would tend more to obtain the goodwill of the people and princes of India than the advantages arising from commerce and rapid communication. Cotton, corn, and wool could be had in abundance for exportation, and the importation I would also be considerable. all of wbieh weonli -1AR -vc -i, n-
proposeclime of communication to and from Xurrachee to the Punjab. In the year ending April, 1844, upwards of 121,0001. in value was imported at Kurrachee, including stores required for the troops, and the exports only amounted to 1,0001., making 122,0001. ; in the year ending April, I848, the imports amounted to 237,5001. and the exports to 154,5001. ; in the year ending April, 1852 the imports amounted to 489,0001. and the exports to 244,001., together 733,0001. - and in the year endiDn April, 18.56, the imports amounted to 629,0001. and tshe xports to 60o,0U0&, makingtogether 1,234,0001. This showe the capability of extending the trade of the district which was one of the richestinIndia. It had increased from 122,0001. in 1S44 to 1,234,0001. in 1854, although very little had been done to develope the traffic. They might imagine what it world be when they had the facilities of railway and steam communication to der elope the resources of a rich and extensive district. Cotton goods, twist, and thread had been imported from Glasgow and Manchestor to th.- value of 294,0401. last year, and the demand wm increasing. He believed that in the course of a comno aAtivelv ahnrt time Scinde would export not only large je -.it f *;f
cotton, indigo, and dye stuff, but immei..e 'i- U. f grain. Its power of producing vlheat w_s uni . d its cornfactors would compete with ilni. Of I *S. . At present all the trade was con7(;e i to and fro oetween Kurrachee and Bombay, instead of and from Xurrachee direct, without the mate- :ention DO I ombay. There was no doubt of the capabilities of the harbour of Kurrachee, and steps were being taken by the local authorities to make it available for large ships and a considerable trade.
Resolutions were passed adopting the report, and re-
:ting the retiring directors and auditor.
anks were voted to Mr. Frere for his kindness in atteading the meeting.
Major-General TI&ExHMi, chief engineer in the Pnjab, described the pro xosed line in that district as one of e constrction, ans stated that the district of the Punianh was the richest in Ind,a. At times the whole face of the cotntry was one eheet of corn, and it was one of the heat sugar districts izn India. He concludea by moving a vote of thanks to the chairmnan and directors, for the abilty and zeal in conducting the afFAirs of the company, which was passed unanimously.
The meeting theen separated.
BLYTH AND) TYKNE.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held at Newcastle-on-Tyne on Monday, Mr. J. Carr in, the chair.
The report of the directors stated that the revenue continues to increase. The directors expect that the iorpeth branch wiU shortly be opened for the use of thepublic. The docks at Hayhole are progresnn g towardk completion. ThA directors have umade an application to noarliacent for loav
to abandon the Longhirst braiich, authorized by the company's act ofl1854, and for liberty to constmruc inilien thereof a line to Warkworth, directly through the northern hear ofthe coalfield, The linewil sbe of an inexpensive character, and the graients exceedingly favourable ; also the construction of a shore branch from the maiii line near Newshama to the Blyth harboar and docks.
The CJ RMA., in moving the adoption off the report, observed that, as comapared with the same half-year of 18055 their revenue had increaed above 10 per cent. The expenditure had increand, bet not in the same ratio, the increase amounted to 4 per cent. Since the new workshops were opened a considerable amount of work had been done. A considera,ble number of waggons had been purchased in consequence of the increased traffic on the iise Wheni thin Morpeth branch was opened two new colieries would send their coals down it. Theylpropoaedtomake ebranch through ? new country to Warkworth, iL district wherein there was a valuable seam of coal and he maight state that there was a steady increase in the demandafor steam coal.

IMPORTANT WILL CASE.-The case of "Lovett v.
TitroBRTA2,-T WILL CASE.-The case of " Lovett v. l, -ett " is an issue directed by Vice-Chancellor Wood to be tned at the next assizes for the county of Buckingham. 1'he order was made in a suit in which Captain Philip Cosby Lovett, of Liscombe-house, Soulbury, is the plaintiff, and the Rev. Pobert Lovett and others are defendants. The questions to be submitted to the jury are three-whether certain testamentary papers executed by the late Miss Elizabeth Lovett, bearing date respectively the 16th of May and 18th of October, 1553, and some time in the month of June, 1855, were in fact her testamentary papers and desires by her. The plaintiff seeks to establish these papers as the will of Miss Lovett. The defendant, to whom^and to whose elder brother successively, as her heirs male, Miss Lovett had for many years prior to 1853 devised her estates, resists the prayer of the plaintiffs bill, on the ground that in and after the year 1853 Miss Lovett, by reason of severe illness and the decay incident to advanced age, had become mentally incapable of making a will; and, also, that the execution of the aleged testamentary Papers of 1853 and 1855 had been procured by undue in'duence, in the nature of coercion and misrepresentation, exercised on the mind of Miss Lovett by other relatives. Both plaintiff and defendant stand in the same degree of relationship to the testatrix-that of first cousin twice removed. The estate has been in the family of the Lovetts for five centuries, and is said to be worth from 3,500L to 4,0001. per annum. The members of the family claim to be descended from Robert de Louvet, one of the companions of the Conqueror, to whom he was Master of the Hounds. The family had at one time large possessions in Devonshire, and aiso in Ireland, where some of its members held high office. The will of the deceased lady disposes of estates in Tipperary as well as in Bucks. Mr. Serjeant Byles has been retained fur the plaintiff. Sir F. Tesier,Mr.O'Mlle, QC., Andir. D). Keane are retained for the defendant. IQ is sexpectd that the trial of the cause will occupy a week.-Buck HCi-aid.

The Irish Elections.
THE IRISH ELETIONS.
CLONMFL.
whe contest for Clonmel has resulted in a majority of 154 for lUr. Bagwell over Mr. Murray, and of 20 for Mfr. Parefoy over the Roman Catholic candidate, who fought the battle singlehanded, with the leading clerical influence against him and exercised in favour of his Protestant antagonist. The motive of Jr. Bawell's committee in suddenly setting up that gentleman's relatire is obvious, and would seem to indicate that there is danger in thef lera objection to Mr. Bagwells return on behalf of r. aMurray, to the effect that the former is incompetent to be elected, inasmuch as his conducting agent Ls also sub-sheriff of the county. Theproceedings, upon the whole, are a good s]cimen of Tipperary tactics. The idea of going tbrough the formality of a petitioa in order to hand over the seat to the candidate who stood second on the poll can scarcely be entertained byMr. Mfurray.
LIERCK.
Mr. WiUliam Monsell was re-elected yesterday for the county of Limerick with an unanimity of *ood feeling not often characteristic of Irish elections. His proposer was Mr. John White, J.P., the nomination being seconded by a Roman Catholic clergyman-the Rev. Mr. O''Roorke, P.P. The lattter, in the course of his address, took occasion to draw a contrast between Governments present, past, and prospective. The rev. gentleman said-" I may be asked whether I consider that the present Government is so unobjectionable as to be deserving of the support of the Iri-h Liberals, and especially of the Catholics. (Hear, hear.) My answer to such an interrogatory is a broad and plain one. It is this,-though I am far from being satisfied with them they are still vastly preferable to those who would nowv ineyitably succeed them. (Hear, hear.) I have no desire, nor have any of you, gentlemen, I believe, to see Lord Derby again at the head of affairs; and, under existing circumstances, there would be no other alternative. I therefore say, as the dearly remembered and ever illustrious ptriot, Daniel O'Connell (cheering), has said, give me Whigs with all their faults-and their number legion, I coDfess-in preference to the Tories of Stockport notoriety. (Hear, hear, and cheers.)" Mr. Monsell spoke at considerable length upon the vast improvement which had taken place in Ireland during the last few years, and, divergig from this subject, the right hon. gentleman referred to a question upon which, from recent official experience, ho was enabled to form a conclusive opinion :-" You know that one of the most important measures ever introduced into, and passed by, Parliament of late years has been the system of competitive oxaminatiou for public offices ; that is to say, instead of Dpeope getting places by the nomination of this friend and that friend, as nappened in a great many instances, the public offices were thrown open to public competition-open to the whole kingdom. (Loud cries of 'Hear, hear.') The portion of that most important change with which I myself was concerned was the competitive examination for the Artillery and Engineers, a service so popular that everyfather of three or four sons is anxious to get one of them into it. The success of Irishmen in those examinations is an important fact for us to consider. What has been the result of the system? During the last year there have been four competitive examinations-two for what is called the ' practical class' of Woolwich for lads of from 17 to 19 years old, and the other two for provisional commissions for lads of from 20 to 22 years of age. In every one of these examinations an Irishman has taken the first prize. ('Hear, hear,' and loud cheers.) There was no exception. I have the return in my hand. It states that at the January examination of
856 7 out of 17 were Irishmen; in that of June the five first prizes were had by Irishmen; in the examination for provisional commissions, 6 out of 11 were Irishmen, and in every instance the first prize was got by an Irishman. (Renewed applause.) I do not, nor did I ever, pretend to the gift of prophecy; but, at the time I was starting those examinations, I entertained a strong conviction that such a result as I have stated would arise from them. I hope, therefore, that those who have the conduct of schools and uiversities throughout the country will endeavour to keep us stiU at the head of the scale; that they will exert themselves to give a higher and more solid education to the children comaitted to their care, and maintain us in the proud position of being head of the list at future examinations, which are the means of opening public oirices to al classes in the united kingdom. (Hear, hear.)"
TIPPERARY.
There is now quite a crop of candidates for the vacant seat in Tipperary county. The batch comprises Mr. Ponsonby Barker, moderate Conservative; Mr. W. IL Massey, ditto; Mr. Waldron, a Roman Catholic gentleman of large
roperty, weU known in Dublin as a steady sapporter of iberal principles ; and " the O'Donoghoe from Kerry," who claims to be descended from an ancient Roman Catholic family in the south, with all his sympathies enlisted in the Catholic interest.
LONDONDERRY.
A letter from Derry, dated the l6thinst., announces that, at a large and influential meeting of the landed gentry of the county of Londonderry, jest concluded, Mr. James Johnston Clark-e of Lagantocher-house, near Maghera, has been selected to represent the county in the room of Captain Bateson, who retires from ill-health." Mr. Greer has issued his address to the electors as the champion of tenant-right, &c., and there is no doubt of his receiving a large measure of support from the-Presbyterian body.
Damaged Wheat.
DAMAGED WHEAT.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Being in Margate this day a shopkeeper observeS to
me that the smell of corn was atiil perceptible at his i door, by which it had recently passed. On inquiry, it appeared that be referred to some wheat which had b-en saved from the wreck of the Northern Belle, which wreck took place two or three months since off the Worth Foreland, or thereabouts.
Returning by railway to this place soon after the above conversation before starting I heard some complaints in coarse language about a nuisance. On the train moving the cause of complaint reached me in the form of, I think, tbe most foul, pestilential, and dreadful odour which it has ever been my misfortune to inhale. I opened the windows-I closed them-in vain; no escape during tho transit from the overwhelming abomination. Had the journey been longer, I shudder to think of the consequences to my unfortunate felvow-passengers of the fearful nuisance. As it was, I experienced nausea and internal discomfort to a considerable extent. There were a number of trucks laden with the damaged wheat, of which I had heard, and much of which must have been in an advanced state of putrefaction, forming part of the passenger-train by which I traveclled.
From one of my fellow-passengers I learnt that the nuisance consisted of 5,000 quarters of the wheat in question, on its way to London. Surely, Sir, the railway company were not justified in transporting this filth in company with human beings; bat, what is of more consequence, w ill you inform the London public of the nature of the consigmnent thus made to them?
I am. Sir. vour obedient --vf+.

LIVERPOOL, Feb. 18.-The United States' mail
LIV1RPOOL, Feb. 18.-The United States' mail steamship Atlantic sailed hence for New York to-day, with nine passengers, a full cargo, and the usual mails. There is also on board, in custody, the man Winter,who, as stated in The Times on Monday,was chased across the Atlantic by one of his employers in the Persia, and captured on entering the rier charged with stealing, S2, 000. The ship Fortune, belonging to the " Black Ball" hne of packets, wall saUl tomorrow for Melbourne with about 157 passengers. She was to have taken her departure to-day; but this morning her first and third mates (Joseph Doncan and John Jones) were sent to prison for three months each, and their certificates were cancelled, for having broken into the spirit stores, opened several packages, and wasted and drunk a considerable quantity of brandy, wine, and other liquors. They have been replaced by better men.
TEIE COALAHrIP.ERS OF THE PORT OF LONDON.- A deputation of coalwhippers of the port of London, accompanied by Lord R. Grosvenor, XP., Lord Goderich, X.P., Rev. J. T. Rowsell, of St. Peter's, Stepney, Rev. X.
lCall, Mr. T. J. Furnival, and Air. Flynn, had an interviewyesterdaywith Lord Stanley of Alderley, the president of the Board of Trade, for the purpose of making knowvn to the Government the serious grievances under which they now labour, arising from the withdrawal of the bill which protected them from the old publichouse truck system. The men stated their case. Some years since the Government, in order to better the condition of the coalwhippers, and to rescue them from the vice and misery attending the publichouse agency, established an office from whichi they were employed, and which secured to them the full amount of their earnimgs. Some of the coalmerchants became dissatisfied with the working of the office, and when the proposal for renewing the bil creating the office came on in the ordinary course last session they asked the Governmentnot to continue it, but to allow them to establish a new model office from which they could engage the men. The coalowners and merchants signed a document that they would protect the raen from being employed through a publichouse or in any way exposed to that system, and upon that understanding the bill was withdrawn and the merchants left to establish the office. It has been severalmonthb in operation, and the menassert itto have proved an utter failure as regards preventing the work going to publichouses, and that the old drinking system is rapidly reviving. When the new office was created there were 123 gangs, of nine men in each gang, with 40 supernmueraries. The number of gangs had since been reduced to 85, and the men dismissed iiiust either go into the workhouse or accept the publichouse employmnent, with all its debauchery and misery to their families. A large portion of the men connected with the office were frequently without work, and when they were occupied their wages at times did not exceed 9s. a-week. It was stated as a fact that a large proportion of colliers in the Pool were discharged througb publichouses, and that the number was daily increasing. It was also asserted that two of the merchants who had signed the document only to employ men through the office had broken their promises by engaging hands through another channel. They added that the renewal of the old bill would supply a remedy for this state of things. Lord B. Grosvenor, the Rev. MIr. Rowsell, and the Rev. Mr. MCall addressed some remarks to his Lordship as to the condition of the men. Lord Stanley of Alderley said the position of the men, as had been represented to him appeared certainly very hard. He would cause some inquiry to tmade into matters which bad been submitted to him and perhaps the men would also prosecute their inquiry for facts. Mr. Flynn said, poor labourers with only 9s. a-week bad some difficulty in paying waterageto goonton the river and collect "facts'-the names and number of ships discharged by publicans. The deputation then withdrew.

The necessity oP rigidly excluding visitors during the progress of the interioEdecorations, which are about to be commenoed, and wilL probably occupy a consideable portion of the period ol

Among the company were the Dake of Newcastle, the EarYk of Lincoln, the Bishop of Manobester, Mr. J. Watts (Mayor of Manchester), Sir J. Potter, Meesrs. Fairbairn, Ent3wse,
Ashton, Stern, E. Potter, and Heron (members of the.- executive committee); Mr. J. C. Deane Ir. Mlinchin Mr. J. A. Turner, Mr. S. Lees Mr. i Roldsworth,' Colonel Taylor (deputy Adjutant-Zeneral of the district), and many other persons, memberg of the leading families im the neighbourhood. Among the artists present were Mr. Redyr,ve, Mr. Salomons, Mr. Bostock, Mr. Daval, Mr. E. Boyle, and Mr. G. Barry.
The criticisms passed by the visitors on the building were generally of a very favourable character as regarded the interior. 'Externaly, so huge a mass of building, witl. walls mnresing ny thousand square feet of corrngatea iron, unrelieved by windows or any features of a,. striking character, affordS onlY a very monotonous appearance. com p te ht d pleasing exterior 'who expected anything of a imilar design.

each with a semicircular roof; heri central, and wider andi lo tier tube (which is 104 feet wide and 700 feet long) being the gret hba, whie the tubes orh either aide, which am5 only 48 feet wide, are designed for pictu galleries, The principal architectural features of the exterior of the build. ng are coifined to the eastrn fafade or gra ~nstratce

entmis the first at rntion. T tg height, which is 56. feet in the centre, against a length of 700 feet and & width of 104 feet, is scarcely felt to be deficient,. probably owing to the relief afforded by a transept at the. weste end, hichintersectsthine ictureogalleries asweperthe central hall. The hall is divi&ed longitudinaly into ai. centre and two side aisles by means of two rows of copled, columns, which support the roof-the oentre bein 56 feet, and each of the side aiyes 24 feet wide. A ligft Saleoryh runs round the transept, and advances about 72 feet uP eh side of the great hail, over the side aidses. Ar may be supposed from what bas already been stated,
the lighting of the hail and picture galleries is almost. entirely fronm the roof. The only instance in which this = ralarted from is in the transept, the ends of which o and soth, are glazed from roof to floor. The Iron.
walls are lined inside with pine wood, coated with papernd plaster. These are the leading features of the mlai
building, but at the west end, or back of this pile, a roeom, 24 fet by 200 feet, has been run UP, 8imn
tended for water-colour drawings; and behind this agrain is another room, 24 feet by 12. The easter fafadc of the palace wri be very extensive when completed, being 450 feet

RAILWAYS A.&D REVOLVERS IN GEORGIA.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-By a letter from Mr. Cuyler the president of the Central Railroad of Georgia, I earn that you will simultaneously with this letter, receive from him the " depositions on oath" of the conductor, mail agent, engine drivers, and firemen of the train from Macon to Augusta on the night of the 28th of August lWkt, in absolute denial of the statements of Mr. Arrowsmith as to the " horrors" which he professed to have witnessed in the " passengercar" of the train in question.
Having been, jointly with yourcorrespondent "H.C.W., the first to contradict this fiction, and having been subsequently identified by none with such contradiction, and specificaUy challenged in your columns and by private letters from persons of high respectability at Liverpool to "authenticate" my peremptory denial of Mr. Arrowsmith's statements, I formally pledged myself to obtain and furnish the required authentication, and to " prove" the story to be as false as I had declared it to be absurd.
I therefore wrote to Mr. Cuyler, forwarding all the correspondence, and urgently entreating him to obtain that "f ormal evidence" of MIr. Arrowsmith's falsehood which I had promised to obtain, and upon which certain of your correspondents insisted. The same request was addressed to Mr. Cuyler by some Americans resident in London, and the result is before you.
I am anxious, however, to impress upon you the fact that the testimony now furnished was not obtained sooner simply because those who wrote from Georgia could not think that a " narrative" Ho incredible would, even if believed for a moment, require any further refutation thau thesimple denial (long since addressed to you) of such men as the presidents of the two railways which had been made the scene of the alleged occurrences.
I wish also to mention that the statement which I forwarded to you from a Georgian new' x, that " the veritable author of the hoax had declared himself," proves to havo been erroneous, Mr. Cuyler informing me mn his present letter that the gentleman by whom that statement. was repeated "had been himself deceived, the authorshi
of the 'narrative' resting with Mr. Arrowsmith, and n3o. with any one in Georgia."
I trust that this matter may now bo considered as set finally at rest, and that I may claim to have redeemed my promise to " obtain proof of aUl that I had asserted ?' and It will probably be also admitted that I was not so " rash" as some of your correspondents imagised in denouncin at. the very outset as monstrous and incredible a story which. is now proved to have been a sheer fabrication from beginning to end.
