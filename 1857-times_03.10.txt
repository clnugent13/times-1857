Court Of Common Council.
COURT OF COMMrON COUNCIL.
VOTE OF COMNlDMENC1 TIN urmTmoo
Ytsterday a Court was held in coDnequenoe of a requis. tion numerously sgned, " to express the opinion of the Court upon the consequences likely to aise to the corminerae of the eountry hfrm the decision of the House of Commons on Tuesday laht, and to take such steps as they may think necessary." There was a lage attendanoe of the members of both Courts of the corporation.
Mr. BESLZY proposed amid cheers the following motion:" Tbat Her Mj esty'. i GTan Cota have, in tise trying situatson nwhIhceyiu'Were PaCd,eted In amner tousain the bouzof the Bltish Zag, the comrical biterefst of the Countr And the cause of trnth and jestlee.
"Th tthisCo0uthaeTlearnttwithfeelingsoI deep regret the dedsion of the bOn. Eonue of Common ans aw t He r Majes Mintsters .or sIpPorting Her Majestys e.raxs in the dcharge f ther duty.
Thatthis Court Presents itis thankg to rord Palmerston an Her Majesty's Mtin for the eoure they pursued on that oocsaon whicb ju4tly entitles them to the eondidence of the oDantry"
Mr. BLSLEY then mid,-My Lord Mayor, Iapproach this subject with some feelings of regret; I certainly do regret that it Will be my buiness to ask the Court to pass a vote of censure upon men with whose antecedents I have been frequently disposed to be pleased. I regret exceedingly that scred principles have been made the stalking-horse of faction. I do feel some pleasure that I think the shock which the late division in the House of Commaons has given to the feelings of the peoDle of Englandcall them prejrdices if Ion like-will be sufficiently powerful to arouse their sleeping energies. One of the grtest bAnes of thi oounatry for the last 10 years has been the indifference of the People to matters of great national import. I hope that indifference wil cease to exist, and that wea have the people of England attending to their own affairs The late Sir Robert Peel, than whom we could hardly bave better authority in Parliamentary practice laid it down aS a maxin thatwhen the Parliamentary Opposition enunciated a principle at variance with theprincipTesof the Executive, and that Parliamentary Oppoeition received the support of a majority of the House of Commons, it Was the dut of the Execntive to resign office, and allow tIe, Pal mentary Opposition to act upon the GovernInentontheirownprinciples. (Hear, hear.) Now, I ask any reasonable set of men to look at the division lists and see if, by anyposihility, they can complain of the conduct of the Governmment for the part they have taken in the recent debates. (Hear, hear.) It is not my intention to detain the Court by reading copious extracts of proceedings oontained in this blue-hook (referring to the blue-book containing the papers relatug to the operations at Canton), but I, nevertheless, feel It my boanden duty to read to you one or tro of them. I will read you a despatch fromt Lord Clarendon respecting a transaction on the 22d of March, 1856, and which isaddressed to Sir John Borszng-
"Slr,-I have received your desptch of the !id of Nuo;ember ls"t reportingthe atepgswhichyoutook In conequence of the refusat of the Chinese authorities at Canton to surrender, when required to do so by Her Majests Consul, two lorchas bearing the British Ilse, and which had been sezed by them on a chare of being enaged in snug-
ling salt and h bAve to state to You that, having conslted the law oflioers of the Crown, Her Majests'. Governrent re of opinion that you acted properly in alSing In the aid of thenaval authoritlssand in rescing the vesels so Improperly detained "
Now, I find that there are other transactions of the same sort to be found detailed in this volume which assume the charcter of a premeditated series of insults to the British flag up to the 10th of October, 1656. (Hear, hear.) On the 8th of October, 1856, Consul Parkes addresaes Comomissioner Yeh in these terms-
" This mrning, shorty alter 8 o'clock, a Chinese warboat boarded in Engish lorcba, the Azrow, lying at anchor In the river near the Dutch Folly, and. recardlesa of the remonatrancs of her master, an Ehlman, seized. bound, and carrded off 12 of her Chines crew, and hauled down the English colou.- which were theu flying. (Hear, bear.) Hesitating to rely solely on the masteer account of so groes an outrage, I at once deptobed people to make inquiries, and found that the facta were as he had ,tated, and ht the Wroat, said to be under' thel oommand of Lian-quo-tnnu a captain in the Imperial service, atterleaving the lorchA had dropped down the river, aud was lying off Yung-Tdng gate, with the crew of the lorcha stil on board as prisonem"
In another despatch, dated October the 10th, 1856, Consul Parkes reports to SirJohn Bowring.-
" I sbould meation that the Arrowis saling under a colonira oertiSCate of registry, renewable annually, bearing tbe date 'irongkong. September 27,1855,' and the number 27. She is therein mid to belong solely to Pong-Afing, of Victoria, Hongkong, Chinese trader, but the plaC and date of her bill are not iven. The masters name I Thomas Kennedy, a iative of Belfast, ad a very repectable mr2 of his class who infornssme that he was engaged hy Mr. Block (Danish Consul at Eongkong) as nominal master of the lorchas, which he has hitherto beleved to belong to ?r. Block's oomprador, and he suppoe that it is the compradoes namne which appears on the register."
The aomplaint made has been that the Arrow had no right to hoist English colours. Eer date of registration is September, 1855, so that some days before this outrage too place her rebister was said to have expired. Mr. Besley here quoited e=tracts from several other despatches from the British representatives at Canton, and saLd that no doubt whatever could be entertained that the Chinese had acted towards British subjects with studied insult. He proceeded,-Now. what would have been said of any offlioer mtrusted with Her Majesty's commission, whose business it ws to protect the commerce of England, if he had been cognisant of such transactions aLs these and had not at once ask-ed pernisson to repress them? With regard to the transaction mnder our more immediate notice, two hours were given for an apology No apolo was however, made but a quibble was set up tha the lorcha had no right to Lave English colours This, thereforevwas a premeditated insult offered to the British managers, and I hold that those men would have been traitors to their country if they had not used the force at their disposal to punish it. (Cheers) Suppose that Mr. Consul Parkes had pocketed the affront, the very men who opposed the Government on Tuesday night last would havee been the very first to condemn his conduct. (Hear, hear.) A French newspaper, the UnirCs-, speaking of our Parliament, says, " What do these solemn debates and philanthropic declamations really signify? One sole object; the political adversaries of Lord Palmerston wished to obtain his place; and while the Parliament of England is gravely discussing the justice or legality of this war the Chinese are setting a price upon the heads of Europ
and are surrounding them with asasins, incendiaries, and poisoners. (Hear, hear.) The Bishop of Oxford in his speech evidently lost sight of all that Christian nations have suffered from China. The English orators are really too considerate when they invoke the right of nations, justice, and humanity in favour of a population which, by every act, places itself beyond the right of nations, and systematically violates all the laws of humanity and justice." (Hear, hear.) Now, my Lord Mayor, I believe it to be our bounden duty to back up Lord Palmerston with all our strength. ("Hear, hear," and
' No, no ") Lord Palmerston on the present occasion has stood up boldly in defence of the rights of the people of England,and Ilhope that he may be generously,heartily, and vigorouslysupported. (Loud cheers.)
Nr. Deputy D %x.;, in seconding the motion, said that if ever there was an occasion when the Court might fairly examine into transactions of the kind under consideration, and which affected the honour of the country, the progress of commerce, and the general welfare of the nation at large, this was that occasion. (Cheers.) The country was on the eve of a general election, the Minister having thrown himsolf upon the consideration of the people. In the city eminentmerchants, bankers, and members at Lloyd's had considered the occasion sufficiently urgent to mnove a step in the cause of order and good government. (Hear, hear) Why should not that Court also express its opinion upon the current matters of the day? Ho believed that this would be the view taken by the Court, and that the consideration of the question would be entered upon with all calmness and with an earnest desire to arrive at a just and equitable conclusion. It was clear to the mind of everybody that Hler Majesty's servants in China had been placed inamost pdinful and trying situation, and had boen surrounded by aifficuties of no ordinary description, and their conduct on that account alone ought to be judged of with themost impatial mind. China, with which lwe had most important commercial relatons, was mainly an empire of opmnion, and Her Majesty's servants were bound to be prepared on the first appearance of danger to act, (Cheers.)
lythetreaty of Nanun, in 1842, it was stipulated that we w ere to have access to Canton, and for the authorities to
adjust any dispute that might arise in the progress of our commerce with that country. This power hadbeensystematlly denied, and on many occasions ccompanied with contumely and insult. (Hear, hear.) He could not help thinking that the resolution, as caried in the Houseof Commons, very unfairly and very dexterously avoided the main question, for it studiously shunned giving any opinion as to the effect of the conduct of the Chinese with regard to the treaty of 1842. It was unfair to isolate this important matter in the resolution. (Hear, hear. What security had we for the protection of our flag if i
was to be torn down with contumely and insult, reparation being denied when demanded ? Mr. Dakin concluded by expressing an earnest hope that the resolution would be carried by a large majority. (Loud cheers)
MIr. ARAIUss Is said, after the manifestation of feeling in the Court, he should be very timid in proposing an amendment to the motion if he did not entertain a strong opiRion that the present proceeding was an intermeddling with Government matters, with which the corporation, in its municipsl capacity, had no right to interfere. (" Hear, hear " an "No, no.") He would not discus the question
wbother a Parliainentary majority_a ihto vog bt be conceived it to be an extremely dangerous and unwise thing for atmunicipalbodby to mi themselves up in questions of party nse political strife, He condemneds th present step as inconsistent writh the duty of the Court, which wras overstepping its legitimate functions. He proposed the following amendment-
"Thatlishnotezpedlentfer tthi municipa bodyto Interferelna p)artj andrlitical question." (Hear, hear.)
Mr. DE JERSEY said he rose with very considerable pleasure to second the amendment The recent division showed the honesty of purpose of the majority of the House of Commons The man whom Mr. Deputy Dakin eulogized in his resolution had been a member of every Government and every coalition from the time he first became a public man. (" Hear, hear," and laughter.) He conceived that this was a political question with which the Court had nothing wbatever to do. (",Hear, hear," and "No, no.")
Alderman Rosx said it was the bounden duty of the Court to depart from the ordinary routine of their businee5, and to express in the strongest and most determinedImanner that the conduct of the coalition had been such as not only tojnstify arge meetihgs in the country, but that that munmcipal body (the Corporation of London) was also bound to express their opimon upon the same subieet It was not a legal question, but a statesman's question, as to whether we were to protect our commanders and servants abroad. (Hear, hear.) The whole history of our relations with China had been one of outrage and insult, nd it was not until insult and outrage had ssumed a great pitch that our offlcers abroad were compeled, with a vier
to the preservation of life and property, to interfere to put ft down. Lord PaS;merston ha been called nnon to take the reins of government at a period when the ionour and Intedrst of tbe country wrere in the msnet extreme jeopardy,
and ws july entitled to the best thanks and onsideration of the community at lage. (Cbeen )
Mr. W. JONzs said, it'A wa t noa gaton with him an to thepolicyofth6eCou indissingt emeritsoftheArrowl question, but, ha got entangled iu a wLr, it was the bounden duty of the verniment to carry it on with Tigour and effect. ("lHear, hear," and "No, no.")
Alderman SAwroNs said, be did not see anv reaon for I withlrawing confidenoe in Lord Palmnerston. The Governmnent, exercidng a very proper and chivalic feeling, bd approved what Sir ohn wring had done. The real
uestion was whether anything had been done by the Goi.ernment to induoe the people of the eountry to with. draw their confidence in the Chuef Minister of the Crown.
Mr. ROWE warmly suLpported the policy of Lord Palmerston, and maid that it wAs not the principle of the Canton war that defeated the Ministry, but it was a factions Oppoition in the Houe of Commons. After strongly denouncing Governor Yeh on account of his monstroos eruelties, be said he hoped that tho present demonstration of opinion would most materially strengthen the hands of the Government. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. GILPiX said, that he oould not consent to narrow the question down to the suggestion of Alderman Salomons, as to whether any reason existed why they should withdraw their support from Lord Palnerston. The transactions in China detailed to the ptblic of late could only bo characterized as atrocitie. It ought to be borne in mind that at present the testimony of the accused had not been heard. It was not for him to defend the Conservative Ministry in the course wbich they had taken. He did not rastify the atrocities nor Liate the conduct of Governor Yeh, whom he beieved to be a thoroughly wicked man; but he denounced the unnecessary employment of bombs in a closey crowded town. (Cheors.) God had made of one blood aU natMons, and be (Mr. Gilpin) no more jnstified the outrage upon the one hand than he did upon the other. He abominated both. He could not support a vote of confidence in Lord Palmerston as a poNtial man, and he could not abandon his own politicol honesty at the request of any party. A vote of confidenoe in Loord Palmerston meant that they would only have a half-and-half support of the Jewish que tion; that they would not have vote by
ot, that there would bo no abolition of church. rates; it meant farther a vote in favour of State educato.Htherefore could not support avote of confidence in Lord P.dmerston, as he had not that confidence in him. (" Hear, hear," and laughter.) Ho was desirous of earnestly opposing the motion, and regretted that the amendment h not been simply the previous question. If the motion meant to approve of the Chinese var and the acts of Sir John Bowring, he objected to it on that account. While he abhorred the atrocities of the Chinese, which he did not seek in the remotest degree to justify, he abominated what he was told was, and what he believed to be, the unnecessary bomabardment of a crowded city. (" Hear, hear," and cheers.) While he did not throw the slightest slur upon those who voted in favour of the Ministry, he gave to those who voted in opposition the same credit for honesty of purpose. An unhesitating approval of the acts of Sir John Bowring, in his opinion, would give a sort of carte btanchc to onr representatives in China and all the world over to get into any amount of blood without sanction, trustingthat the home authorities would justify the act. (Loud cheers).
Mr. Ross said, he thought the Government of the country ought to support their officials abroad, and that if the Government should be intimidated by a recreant majority in the House of Commons and attempt to patch up affairs, there could be no doubt that most disastrous reslts would follow to our countrymen in China, and have a most inunrions inauence upon the best interests of society. (near, hear.)
Mr. ANxoToX said, hehad known Sir John Bowring intimately for 35 years, and had always known him to be a most moral, upright, oonscientious gentleman, and he believed him to be the last man in the world to enter into a war with the Chinese if the noeessty did not strongly exist. (Hear, hear.) Had SirTJohn Bowring not acteda asho had done, he would have been recalled by the Government, and would have been designated a coward and a poltroon. Mr. Anderton justified the acts of Admiral Seymour, and concluded by stating that he thought the Court was bound to give a vote of confidenoe in Lord Palmerston. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. Deputy GoDsoN opposed the motion, and said he hoped au amendment more congenial to the wishes of the Court would bo carried.
Mfr. HuDsoN said he would not vote in favour either of tho ornginal motion or ofthe amendment, as he did not conceive the Court to be the proper arena for the discussion.
fr. BEsLxy havin replied, the amethment as put, and, after a show o viands was taken, the Court divided, when there appeared-
In favour of the amendment ... .., 13 Against it... ... ... ... ... 39
Majority ... ... ... ... -26
Mfr. GILPiN then moved the previous question as an amendment.
Deputy GODSON seconded the amendment, which, upon being put, was negatived by a considerable majority.
The original motion was then put, and carried amid loud cheers, and the Court adjourned.

To The Editor Of The Times.
I TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMtES.
Sir,-fr. Gladstone is reported to have said that the island of Hongkong was given up by the Chinese Government as a careening station, and, in proof of his statement refers us to the terms of the treaty, as if this were a regular bargainl He adds that we have not applied it to the specified use, but, contrary to treaty, have made it a place of general trade, and drawn to it a population of 60,000 Chinese. But I think I shall succeed in showing you that this is a complete perversion of the facts of the case.
Hongkong was not given over on certain conditions by the treaty of Nankin. It had been taken possession of and declared a British colony many months before, andthe town of Victoria had been surveyed and much of it baUilt. The clause in question was a mere form introduced to lessen the mortification of the Emperor in acquiescing in the seizure of the island. It was taken possession of, not as a careening station, butas likely to become a great commercial entrepot, as a secre naval station, and as a contre of local trade, in which the Chinese who resorted to it would escape the cruel exactions of the Mandarins; and, no'vwithstanding the deprossing influenoes to which it was long exposed chiefly under the rule of the right hon. gentleman when Colonial Secretary, it has realized the expectation, originally formed of it.
I must not say that Mr. Gladstone intended to mislead the House when he spoke of a careening station, but I ask, did it look as if he regarded the island as a mere careening station whenhe repuadiatedthelandsales concluded by Captain Elliot, put the lots up to auction again, and used undue means to raise the rents to a most exorbitant amount, paralleled only in Belgravia and Melbourne? Did it seem so when he sent out some two dozen placemen-Stperintendent, Lord Chief Justice, Attorney-General, Colonial Secretary, Treasurer, Bishop-drawing in all salaries amounting to 28.0001.? Did it seem so when he imposed taxes on the inhabitants to an extent that made the colony become one of the moet heavily taxed portions of Her Majesty's dominions? When his object was to exact money and find places he looked on Hongkong as an important and valuable colony.
Ye' he did avail himself of the other theory, of a careening station,when it suited him. All connected with China know that the polcy adoptod and sanctioned by Mr. Gladstone had the effect of driving respectable Chinese from the isLand to such an extent that it was at one time nearly deserted, and proporty foll to one-third of its value. It now comes out that it was Mr. Gladstone's intention to do so. He did not wish the plae to be resorted to by the Chinese. He therefore, by exactions, by monopolies, and lcenses, and by offensive police regulations drove them away. Under ono theory he secured his rents; under another he deprived the merchants of the means of paying them. In short, he did reduce the island to the position of a careening station, continuing his exactions and still keeping up his staff of officials.
A very different system has prevailed of late years.
The opium monopoly ceased after the proceedings of the select committee of 1847, but three licenses granted at exorbitant prices were substituted-those, with the additional one for the sale of spirits and of weighing salt, to be smuggled into Canton. There is aiso a license on sailors' boarding-houses, and for poice rates. These, I think, are all the direct taxes; the remainder of the revenue is mado up from land rents, which have so much increased of late that there is a surplus after paying all the extravagant expenses of the colony. The land, or rather the sea in front of the Queen's-road, sold at immense rates, and the expense of a building so founded must bo enormous, as to seaward they are at least on 10 feet water.
The opium trade has hitherto been mostly carried on at Canton-that is, sold at Canton, and delivered at Cumsingmoon, on the iacao side of the estuary, to which place it is conveyed either by the ship or steamer that brings it to Hongkong at its own expense. Indeed, except for consnmption or exportation to other places, the salo of opium is very small comparatively to what it is at any of the five ports. At Shangha a nd the northern porti chests of opium maybe Landed and storedas openly as ho many bales or cotton, only, for many reasons, it is not considered advisable to do so in large quantities of an article so Evaluable.
; I am, Sir, your obedient servant

The report of the directors of this oompany, adoped at the halt-yearly aeeting, roommended a dinidend at the rate of8 percent. pr annum for the hialfyear ending Sho 31s of Dleember last. The genl trafeli on thene for the year 1856 amounkd to 55,362l. and for 1855 to 41,7314, showing an increue of 13.6M TRe working expetas for 1856 amounted to 19 2921 against 183941. for 1I55, showing an increase of oniy 895L, notwithstnding the large Increame inthe receipts of 13,63DL The trffiEc returns for the prfeent y"r have been up to the present time very farourable. The balanee to be carried to the next count, ater providing for the dividend at the rate of 8 per ent, per annum, would be abont 3,800L, but 1,000L of that sum would be required for the renewal of thepermawent way. The doea-
neat for effect to theroeolation passed at the meeting onthe 9th of ebrary, approving the arranment with the Ulverstone and lanIaster Companr, has been completed, and the works on that line re in active operation. The directors bave applied to Parliamcnt for powers to construct a railway from tho terminus of the Fumens line at Broughton to Coniston. They are asured that the estimated expene is not lkely to exceed 45,0001, and, being only 5,0001. per mile, it is epe4ted that the propoliedUne will prove remunerative The Coniston Copper Itining Company and the lay of the manor from whom they hold their leae ave szeed to take shares to the extent of 10,0001,, itpon being

The Barrow Harbour Commissioners are making satisafctoryprogress with the works for deepening and improving the harbour. The eapital account znowed that 500,1371 had been received, and496,301 expended. The revenue account for the half-year ending December 31 showred that 29,914L had been received, and 13,2491. expended on wrorkcing, and 5,9544 for interestonloans andpre.erenoeeishres, leaving a balnce, including 2,7531. from the preceding lallqyear's account of 13,4644, available for divi7end.
NEWCASTLE AND CARLISLE.
The directors of this oompany ste in their annual report that an intermediate dindend at the rate of 21. liO on the 1004 shares, and so in proportion for those of a mainor value, subject to deduction of income-tax, ws paid for the half-year ending the 30th of June lit;, aid they now furtherroeommend a dividend at the rate of 3f per share for the half-year ending the 31st of December last, paablo on snd after the 31St of March, subject to deduction of income-tax, thus making the dividend for the year 1856 51,10s. per cent. The aebentures falling due during the past year have been renewed on satisfactory terms. The increase of the revenue over that'of the preceding year is 8 ,471 - and, as this has been obtained by an addition of only 1,b20. to the working and other expenses, a balance, after provding for the dividend for the year, is added to the reserved fund, which now amounts to 12,71N. A considerable amount has been expended out of revenue during the year in the maintenanoe of the way, and in additions to stations, extensions of platforms, and new works required for the accomnnodation of the traffic. The rolling stock hu been kept in efficient workdng order, and the cost of a new locomotive engine, of 16 cattle trackg, and of 29 ehaldron waggons, required to replce old ones, has been charged to revenue. The traffic of the hematite ore of Whitehaven into the Middlesborough district i going.on satisfactorily, and in the iron ore traffic on the Ashton line there is an addition, with a prospect of further improvement, and the demand for the limestone of that district ia6 increased considerably. The oompletion ofthe new dock at Maryport may be expected during the present year, and the new harbour at Silloth, which is in course of rapid formation, will Oive facilities in conducting an increased traffic with regularity and expedition. With reference to the Border Counties Railway, it in reported that the works have made much progress, An early communication by this line with the valuable and extensivo mineral district of the Duke of Northumberland and other proprietors may be looked for, and will ope an important source of additional traffic. The permanent way is in excellent order; the engines and rolling stock have been greatly improved, and are in efficient working condition. The capital account shows that the cost of the main line and Aistoa brnch amounted to 1,913,9024
PORTSMOUTH DOCKYARD BRANCEL
The dockyard at Portsmouth is now being connected by raitlway with the line at LAndport, thus giving increased facilities for the embarcation and disembarcation of troops, baggage, stores, or munitions of war. This new railway on the Portsmouth side is rather more than a mile in length, and its course, after crossing the Lion-gate-road, is almost parallel to the Flathouse-road, curving off as it neas the harbour, then erossmg over the widest part of the moat by means of a swimg bridge, and pasing through the rampart, under which is a well executed bridge. The line (a asngle one) enters the dockyard within a few feet of the chief entrance to the convict prison, and is to be extended dowrL to the jetties. The works are to be completed on the 15th of Aprl.
HONDURAS INTROCEANIC.
An influential meeting of merchaUts and others was held yeaterday at the Town-hail, Manchester, in reference to the proposedraiayfromthe Atlantic to thePacific Ocean. Mr. E G.Squier, and a deputatine from the board of directors attended, to exlain the bearings of the undertakng on tho commerce of this country. Mr. J. Watts, the mayor, pre-
3r. G. WrLsoX said fr. Squerwoas the representative of the United States in Honduras for many years, and was the originator of this railway, for which he had obtained the, concession. The board of directors consisted of 17 members, of whom six resided in America, seven in London, two in Manchester, and two in LiverpooL
Mr. SQUziXS detailed at great length the circumstances which had brought to his knowledge the vst superiority of the route of the proposed railway from Puerta Cabelio, on the Atlantic, to the bay of Fonseca, on the Pacific (a length of 147 miles), over the routes by Panama and Tehuantepec; and entered into particulars as to the salubrious nature of the country traversed, its mineral richness and fertility, and the great capabilities of the terminal ports. The route now proposed was conteniplated in the 16th century by the Spanish Government as the future line of communication - but the subsequent wars and declining power of Spain led to the abandonment of the project. The terms of concession were much more liberal than thoso granted in the case of the other two routes to which he had alluded; and Dr. Scherzer, of Vienna, had reported on the country as being capable of producing all the products of the tropics. The proposed railway woud shorten the distance from-New York to San Francisco by 1,300 miles, or 10 dasW time, and would attract a great proportion of the travellng from the Panama route, which had paid 12 per cent. yearl The proposed magimumn cost of the line would be $10,0 0,000, and he estimated th net revenue at $3,200,000 per annum. The opening of the Atlantic telegraph and the probable telegraphic connexion from Puerto Cabello to Havannah would place that pert of the world in almost instantaneous communication with Europe. (Hear, hear.)
Mr T BAZLEY proposed a resolution, expressing the importanos of connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans b means of a railway across the territory of Honduras, which would facilitate the transmission of passengers, merchandise, and specie, with ertainty and regularity.
The MsiiS-mI CUTLER of Sheffield seconded the resolution.
Mr. E. WATIN stated that the direCtors of the undertakingbad decided, at their own risf, to send outacompetent staff of English surveyors and engineers, assisted by a Government engineer, already nominated by Lord Clarendon, to verify all the calculations before the matter was launcbed before the public as a commercial scheme. (Hear, hear.)
The resolution was carried unanimously, as were votes of thanks to MIr. Squier and the Mayor.

Fearful Scene In A Chapel.-Shields, March
FEARF'UL SCENX I[N A ( PELr-SmXDs, Mfarch 9.-A dreadful scene occurred last night in at new oh& opened by the Wesleyan Reformers in North Shields.
Rvl GriQilth, a popular preaeber in that body, was preaching one of the opening sermons. The chapel was crowded, tbe aidlos a5 well as the pewt being filled writh people, when in the mniddle of the rev, gentleman's diconrse a cry was rawd in the gallery of "Fire!" and on looldng up to a dome-light in the roof the congregation saw that tho gS had set r to thceiling and was licking its way along the woodwork in an alarming manner. They appered to be fascinated for a moment, and then amid screams and shouts a general rush was made to the doors. Many women fainted, and the scene that followed was of the most alarming and fear. ful character. Soveral of the officers of the church, however, are eafaring men, and, with the usual promptitude of their cass, the kept back the crowd. By a fortunate coincidence Mra. W.r y, a shipbroker, was letting a woman and child out of one of the front doors at the moment he heard the crowd rushing from the gallery, and he threw it open. Another person, a local preacher, who was returning from an out-station, was also coming in by the other front door, and he threw it open, so that the crowd had free egress. Three or four hundredpersons were also got out by the back doors, and-what is, perhaps, almost unprecedented in a panc of this character-the whole of the densely packed congregation was got out without the least personalinjury The preacher and the offiers exhibited mxnly courage and selftpo.sesdon during the whole of the trying scene, and they deerve every credit for the 6pirit they showed in resisting the cowardice of the crowd. Some women so exhibited noble self-possession. The same class of men who showed so much true courage in clearing oute the people ery speedily extinguishedt the fire wthout any serious damage basing been d'one to the chapel
House Of Lords, Monday, March 9.
PARLIAMENTARY INTLLIGENCE. I
HOUSE OF LOBDS, MoNDAY, MARCH 9.
DIVORCE AND TESTAMENTARY DIC
BILLS9.
Lord LYNDHURST asked the noble and learned lord on the woolsack what course he meant to pursue with respect to the Divorce and Testamentary Jurisdiction BiUs.
The LORD CHANCELLOR r3vlied that in the present state of Parliament it was not the mtention of the Government to proceed further with either of those Bills during the present session; but they would be re-introduced, with
some alterations, at the very earliest period after the re- I assembling of Parliament.
CHRINA.
The Earl of HARDWICKE ventured to foUow up the question he put the other evening to the noble Secretary of War. The noble lord had stated that certain despatches would he speedily published, and he now wished to know when the noble lord intended to give those despatches to the public, the more particularly as every hour seemed to thicken the plot in China. It appeared that the English had been compelled to receive assistance for the protection of English subjects at Hongkong from a distingaished nation-the French-for whose assistance they must always feel gratefuL It was certainly very painful for Englishmnen to feel that they were obliged to seek the a6sistance of a foreign nation, however great and distinguished, for the protection of British subjects, He did not say that that statement was true, but he was anxious to know what the public had a right to know-whether the British subjects in that part of the world were in jeopardy, and whether the recent state of affairs in China was something like, he would not say defeat, but great difficulty; and whether the English had, to a certain extent, been obliged to receive assistance from a foreign nation.
Lord PANMURtE said that what he had stated the other evening was that he had received despatches from Colonel Dunlop, stating that certain operations had taken place in the neighbourhood of Canton, and that some casualties had occurred, a return of Which had since appeared in the Gazette. He had also stated that he received a commuxmecation respecting the manner in which a company of infantry had acted in the performance of an important duty in which they were engaged.
TORTURE IN BENGAL,
The Earl of ALBEMARLE gave notice that on Monday next he would move for a copy of a memorial from the European and other Protestant missionaries residing in or near Calcutta, addressed to the Hon. F. J. Halliday, Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal1 alfeging that the tortures are infficted by the native pohee, zemindars, and others on the inhabitants of Bengal, specifying other social evils to which the said inhabitants are subject, and praying that a commission be instituted to inquire into the allegations of the aforesaid memorial; also, for a copy of the reply of theHon. the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal to the above memorial; anda copy of a niinute of the Hon. F. J. Halliday, Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, dated the 2Oth of April, 1856, showing the inadequacy of the judicial system, the lawless character of the police, and the miserable condition of the inhabitants of thegovernment under his authority. He -would also move for the appointment of a commisSion similar to that which was instituted at Madras for a like purpose in 854, to inquire into the alleged infliction of torture by the police or other parties under the Government of Ben gaL.
OPIUM TRADE OF CHINA.
The Earl of SHAFTESBURY said that, as he had some reasonato believe that the Government would accept the proposition that he was about to m ake with certain modifications, it would not be necessary to weary their lordships with a long preliminary statement. His object was to draw attentionI to the evils arising from the opium trade, and to the state of the law on that subject; and, having ascertained what the law was, and whether the opium trade, as at pre. emnt carried on, was legal or illegaL their lordships would then be able to devise a remedy for the eviL Their lordships must all have heard a great deal of the opium trade between India and China. He knew of nothing that had of late more occupied the public mind and more scandalized the public conscience than that most immoral system, which was one of the most flagitious instances of unscrupulousness in the pursuit of wealth that mankind had ever witnessed. So long as that trade existed it would be impossible that peace, honour, quiet, and good order should prevail between the territories of India and China. This trade was in every point of view scandalous and perilous. Commerciallyit was the geatest impediment to legitimate traffic with China. It imposed the most severe restrictions upon the export of manufactures from this country. It impoverished alike both China and India, while it deprived this country of one of the greatest sources and most profitable outlets that could be found for the products of our commercial industry. If their lordships looked at the question financially, they would find that the opium trade inflicted a great and permanent injustice upon the revenue of India, and that a better system would not only tend to the benefit and happiDnes of the ryot, but wouldalso greatly increase the legitimate revenue of the East India Company. In a political point of view the opium trade was a source of perpetuAl irritation and conflict upon tho south-eastern coast of China, and so long as it existed a state of constant war would be carried on between the opium smugglers and the Custom-house authorities of the coast of China. The existence of such a traffic was most disgraceful to the national character of England, and the testimony of those who knew China best vas, that opium and Christianity could not enter China together. He sincorely believed that the existence of the opium traffic had done more to discredit Christianity in China than anything else could possbly do, while the existence of opium cultivation and the ravages it produced had a similar effect on the people of India. No one Government was more responsible for the existing state of things than another, The evil had existed for more than half a century, and it had been encouraged and connived at by successve Governments, yet no Parliament had ever ventured to give a legislative sanction and positive enactment authorizng the monopolT and the trade in opium. There had been a growing sentiment for many years pat, both in this counir7 and in India, that the whole of this traffic from beginning to end Was illegaL If their lordships examined the various petitions which had been presented from India on this subject they would find that every one of them asserted that the traffic was altogether illegal, and was not only inconsistent with statute law, but was in Airect contravention of the law of the realm. The point to which he wished to direct their lordships' attention was that the connexion between the Government and the monopoly and the trade in opium was inconsistent with the Act of 1833, 'which declared that the East India Company was to cease to be a commercial and trading comany. When he first gave notice of his intention to bring th subject under the consideration of the House he had in tended to move an addre to the Crown, pyng that o a commission of inquiry bheuldben nis d Upon th further consideration he had determine edto aove a res otion condemnatory of the traffic, hut upon going stiu further into the qestion and examining the law he thought it better to ask their lordshps to refer the question for the opinion of the judges. le bad been chareed in letters-some with names and some without-ian articles in the newspapes and in private conenrsation, with haviPl adoPted theltter cousi e or the purpose of giing facilities to the Government and causing delay. nw he declared upon the hlonour of a gentleman that there was not a shadow of trath in these charges, and that he had adopted this particular form of motion, not to give facilities to the Government, hut because he thou tt it would embarrass themsthe most, if hehdo e resolution he should be told, as he had been toid by the lAto Sir I. Peel, that the abstract resolutions were very inconvenient and meant lttle or nothing. If, on the other hand, he had proposed a commission of inquiry he should be told that commnission were very expnsve verY long in their operation, and that it couldn er t o'he expted in so m a.
rtant a matter that the Crown and Parla ment wounl be beund by the appointment of such a commissown. Havinr been convinced that thes wole system was illegal he ha
determined to take his Present course, and to move their lordships to submit the question to theldecision of the juLdges. Hle believed that this course would be most likely to be successfuL He assumed that the Government and the Eoluse would accept his proposition for a reference to the judges, end he held that this was the best course for the question itself. If the judges declared the monopoly and trade illegal he should have carried his point, and it would thenbeforl'arliameuitto devisearemnedy andprovicdea substitute f or anY loss of revenue. If, on the conitrary, the judges declared the trade to be legal he sho-uld have an entirely new starting point, and he could then appa to the people of England to consider this great national in, that bad reduced our character and restricted our opertions, and brought the name of the British people upo te ouh east c-oast of China to a level in morals and coniduct with the old detestable bucaniers of America. He could then mnake a ten times mnore forcible appeal to the public. It would then be declared that the East India Company carried on this traffic under Acts of Pairliament, and that the nation alone was responsible for the sin. The doubts about the legality of the opium trade arose out of the Act of 183, which gave the possession and government of India for a limitedl time to the East India Comapany. The passages out of which the doubt arose were the preamble and the fourth section of the Act, Their lordships would observe that no questionwasraisedupon the rgt of the East India Company to levy duties -upon the growthI or transit of opium growing onterontrioy rpsigtruhhi own territory. The question presented Itself in two aspects -the territoxial and the commeorcial, The territorial aspect was the lAvi3n5- ,I. wi ant opu pasn truh h outy
levying aL duity onn all -A;... h6 beri,tz -apc wasth sorJK ~ ~ O'u u> ao P-aapasg through the country The commercial aspect was the Government of India being the maanufacturers and vendors of opium, like ordinary traders. There was no more objection to the Government levyig a duty on opium than on spirits, but there was a
reat dference between levying a duty and preparing and elling the article, when, moreover, they knew its destination, and the use that would bo made of it in the territories of a friendly empire. The Act of 1833 referred to the Act Of 1813; eh~ Act o£ 1813 referred to the Act of 1793, and that Act agan referred to the Act of 1781; but in none of those Acts was any mention whatever made of opium. The 4th section of the Act of 1834 deolared that the East India Company should cease altogether to bo a trading company.
" And be it enacted that the said company shall, with all convenient speed after the aid 22d day of April, 1854, close their commercial business, oad make sale of all the mer. chandise, stores, and effects, at home and abroad, distinguished in their accounb books an commercial assets, and all their' wvaehouses, lands, tenemenets, hereditaments, and pro. perty whatacever wshich maBy net be retained for the purposes of the Government of the said territories, and get in all debts due to them on account of the commercial brench. of their affairs, and reduce their commercial establishments aS the same shallibecome unnecessary, and disconltinue and abstain from all commercial businems."
Could anv one venture to contend that the whole system of tho monopoly of opium in India, as cried on by the Bast
India Company, was not, to all intents and purposes, a trading busiess ? The poppy juice wa purofia-sed ofth rYot by pre-payment; the ryot was corased to sell to the uEst India Company alone at a fixed rate; the Company manufactured the poppy juice into the drug for exportation, and so careful were they of pleasing their customers that, in the true style of shopkeepmg, letters were sent from the seat of Government to the superintendents of factories, directing them to give the drug this or that flavour; to make it as raoy and seductive as possible. Having manufactured the artic e, the Government had it carried down to Calcutta, and there put it up to auction in their own name. Could any one contend that it was not a commercial transac'ion simply hecause, when the opium was put on hoard the clippers, the Government had no share inthe clippers? It was as clear a comnnercial business as dealing in tea, or anything else in which traders engaged. The section then went on to say :
"They shall discontinue and abstain from all commercial business which shall not be incident to the closing of their actual concerns, and to the conversion into money of the property hereinbefore directed to be sold, or which shall not bo carried on for the purposes of the said Government."
Those were the exceptional words on which the case for the. Company rested; but if their lordships gave to the words "commercial business" for the purposes of the said Governmnent all the force claimed for them by the East India Company, the Company might undertake any commercial transaction, however extended, provided they could take on themselves to say it was for the pUrpOres of the Government. The object of the Act of Parliament was to make them wind up their affairs as a trading company, and continue only what was indispensably necessary for a time, for the purposes of their Government. Could it be supposed that those words were sufficiernt to cover so great a grant as the monopolies of salt and opium, yielding a revenue of 6,0000001. or 7,000,0001. a-year, or that the words "coinmercial business" tlirust in at the end of a section were meant to have so wide a signification ? He was very much inclined to think the Legislature never contemplated anything of the kind. Powers of monopoly were given by the Act of 1793, and what were those powers ?-
" "Nor shall it be lawful for any of His Majesty's subjects to engage, intermeddle, or be in anywise concerned, directly or indirectly, in the inland trade,-in salt, betel-nut, tobacco, &c., except on account of the said Company or with their pernission."
Opium was excluded. The Company could not establish a monopoly; a rmonopoly could only be established by Act of Parliament. Here was an Act of Parliament giving the Company monopoly in salt, betel-nut, and tobacco, and opium was not mentioned. He defied any one to show any statute which gave the Company the monopoly of the trade in opium. In 1834 the House of Commons touched very delicately on the subject. All they said was that it had existed so long they were not prepared to disturb it. But they did not venture to put into the Act continuing the Government in the East India Company a clause authorizing the opium monopoly. The only words on which the Company claimed to exercise so mighty a power, which was productive of fearful results both in lndia and China, were tho exceptional words he had already quoted, and he ventured to submit no grant of a monopoly could be implied from the words " commercial business which shall be carried on for the purposes of the said Governmeut." Many persons were convinced the whole system was illegaL It ought to be submitted to most searching inquiry, and with a view to have a more calm and deliberato inquiry than could be obtained by reference to a commission or a com2mittee, he hopd, their lordships would adopt his proposition-that tue questions he had laid on the table should be submitted to the judges of the land. His own belief was that the judges would declare the traffic altogether unlawful, but should they declare such an abomination existed by Act of Parliament, he should then, if ilife were spared him in the next Parliament, bring the whole notice under the consideration of their lordships. The noble earl concluded by moving that the following questions be put to the judges:-
L Whether, according to the true construction of the 4th section of an Act passed in a session of Parliament holden ixnthe 3d and 4th years of the reign of hIsa late Majeaty King William IV., entitled "1 An Act for effecting au arrangement with the East India Company, and for the better government of His Mfajesty's Indian territories until the 30th day of April, 1854," it is lawful for the East India Company to derive a revenue from opium by the following system-that in to sa,by prhibiting andagreventing the growm-th of the poppy frmwhichopWium is mane within their
territories, except as grown on their account and under their license and superintendency, advances of money being annually made by them to the cultivators of the poppy by way of pre-payment of the price of aU the juice of the poppy of a specified consistence, to be produced from the land in respect of which such advances are made, such price being estimated according toarice fixed by the Company for the district in which the lRan happens to be situated, the cultivators delivering to the Company as much of such juice as the cultivators can produce, such juice being afterwards sent by the Company to their factories, and there manufac. tured by them into opium; afterwards sent by them from those factories to C cutta, and there sold by them by auction at their sales, the excess of the sale prices over and above the first cost constituting the revenue in question.
2. Whether, having regard to the supplemental treaty between Her Majesty and the Emperor of China, bearing date the 8th day of Oictober, 1843, which contains the following words,-" A fair and regular tariff of duties and other dues having now been established it is to be hoped that the systemn of smuggling will entirely cease," it is lawful for the East India Company to deal with such opium in the manner stated in the first question, with the full knowledge that it is so purchased at the above-mentioned sales for the purpose of being smuggled into China in contravention of the laws of that em p ire, and so to cultirate and manufacture the same Wit7h a view principally to the China market, and to its beingso purchased for such purposes as aforesaid, the Compan'w nth that view, manufacturinz the opium into the
eadapted to facilitate and promote tacorbndtrade.
The LORD CHA1NCELLOR admitted that the subject which the noble earl had brought under the notice of the House was one of deep importance, but he did not think the course proposed by him was at aU consistent with the ordinary principles of justice. The noble earl proposed to refer it to the)udges to say whether, according to the true construction of a section of an Act of Parliament, "it is lawful for the Eas India Company to derive a revenue from opium bythe following ystem," andthe noble arl then proceeded to give his views of what that system was. The judges were occasionally summoned to that House to assist it by their advice, but he (the Lord Chancellor) had been unable to discover any case where their opinion had been asked except with a view to some judicial business with which the House was caUed upon to deal, or to guide it in some pending or approaching legislation. The hypothesis of the noble earl was that for the last 20 or 28 years the East India Company, and those who were emuployed by them, had been habitually violating the law of the land. If that stpposition were true every person who had been so engaged was liable to be indicted and punished. (Hear.) But could anything be more monstrous than when such might be the consequencoe of a judicial opinion upon that subject, the House should be called upon to prejudge the question without hearing the parties accused or gvng them an opportunity of being hear ? Surely the noble earl mu
see the extreme embarrassment which would be caused by the adoption of his resolutions. At the same time he (the Lord Chancellor) was prepared, on the part of the Government, to say that upon ascertaining clearly and distinctly what were the facts as to the manufacture of opium, who were concerned in it, in what muaer it was disposed of, and for what purpose, the Government would be willing to submit the question to the highest legal authorities whom they coula properly consult-the law officers of the Crown ; and with regard to the second question, which related to the construction of a treaty, they would consult, in addition to the law officeis of the Crown, the Queen's Advocate. He might content himself with that statement, but as the noble eari ha entered into the question in some detail he (the Lord Chanuellor) would just remind the House what was the object of the statute which had been referred to - it was to discontinue comnmercial trading on the part of' the East India Company, and it was so stated in express terms. The noble earl was not, perhaps, aware of what was well known to aU lawyers, and supported by the decisions of two or three eenturies, that a deel ing with the produeo of one's own land, no matter to what extent, was not a trading im the eye of the law. The trading in salt, alluded to by the noble earl, had been under the cognizance of the law courts, and it had been decided that the owner of salt pits, although he manufactured and sold the produce, was not a trader. It was not posble, anm iorance as they were of all the facts, to ssy that the deaing of the Eset India Company with opium constituted vioilation of the statute of 1an The noble earl had gone further, and said that the opium trade was made a monopoly by the East India Company, which was nLot sanctione by an Act of Parliament, to which he had 'referred. 'Whether the mnonopolY in opium, if it existed, 'Was legal or niot, he (the Lord Chancellor) could not take upon himIself to say without knowing al the facts orfthe caseo,which at present he did not; but, if that wer a omercal eaingon hepart of the East Ihndia Comfplan, thet wobrds at the end of the 4th clause of the ct f 183 mst b bone i mid, "which shall not be carried on for the purposes o the Governmenat." Even shuditb.roenha h Coman eerisd mno
img "f or fine purposes of -the Governmne-nt-." T-herernmi-gh-t'b-e nice distinctions raised upon a careful consideration of the subject, and therefore he should suspend his own judgment until the matter had been fully investigated. In the meantime, he trusted that his noble friend would not press the motion, but would be satisfied with the assurance of the Government, that the question should be submitted to the law offlcers of the Crown.
The Earl of SHIAFTESBURY said, he had not intended to make a motion involving such consequences as his noble and learned friend had mentioned, but, if these consequences were really likely to follow from the adoption of his proposition, he -was ready to withdraw it upon an assurance that the whole subject should be submitted to the law officers of the Crown, and that their opinions should be given after a fuR investigation of all the facts.
Earl GREY thought the noble earl had exercised a wise discretion in not pressing his motion. He had heard with extreme astonishment the statement of the noble earl that the Government acceded to his proposition with some
mnodifications, but he found that the Government altqgethe: objected to the motion. He could not see that submtiig it question to the law officers of the Crown was the san=e thin
as taking the opinion of the judges upona matter which ir. volved great political interests. He altogether objected to such a subject being sent to the law officers of the Crown, as it was A. subject far beyond . the reach of lawyers,
tnd a decisios upon it. could not be obtained! by
mere special pleadng: tan legal technicalities. 'The
qusinwsad twson ffrtogetipr
with our own treaty otligations ? (Hear, hear.) That was a question on which he was not at that moment prepared to express any opinion. 'Undoubtedly it was impossible not to feel psinfuly that the transactions in question were liable to some of the observations which his noble friend (the Earl of Shafesbury) had applied to them. It was impossible-considering that in 1842 and 1843 this country became solemnly hound to the Chinese Government to discourage smnuggling of all description not painfully to feel that the E3ast IndLa Government had been mixed up in those transactions in a manner which it was difficult to justiyb a reference to the ordinary principlea of right ad wrong. (Hear, hear.) le acknowledgei that, but at the same time ho could not shnt his eyes to the fact that it was not always quite clear that their lordships could prevent the practice of vice by attempting to deaL with it by direct legislation. There was, and had been for some time, a question of extreme difficulty all over this country. There were many well-meaning but, as he thought, n-judging persons who thought the sale of intoxicating liquors onght to be altogether prohibited- He had alrays been persuaded that any legislation of that kind would be entirely fruitless. (Hear, hear.) It ought to be remembered that while opium was a drug liable to abuse it was also
medicine of the utmost importance to the welfare of mankind. (Hear, hear.) Their lordships could not altogether prohibit the introduction of it without inlicting the greatest possible evils, not only upon one part of the world but upon the whole world- ana, they wero not to prohibit the introduction of it, ie questioned whether it was in the power of any Govemment, whenopiumwas produced and alowedto be sold, to regulate the mauner in which it should be sold. When it once pssed into the hands of the private consumer, he (Earl Grey) could not understand how by any machinery a Government could prevent it being apphed to bad purposes instead of good, or how they could limit the use of it
to what might boe considered lawfl purposes. For himself he did not perceive that great diflerence which his noble friend had endeavoured to establish between levying an isport duty on opium and levying revenue by means of a monopoly. At the same time the question remainedhad we, or had we not, after the opium bad passed fronm the hands of the Indian Government, wilfully encoaragedsmuggling? (Cheers from the Opposition.) Upon that point he had expectod to hear some more remarks from his noble friend. He (Earl Grey) could not help reminding their lordships that they had learnt from the Treasurer of Hongkong that the Passing of the receat colonial ordinance had been of great advantage to the colony, because it had increased the coasting trade in that colony in cotton, opium, and other products. (Hear, hear.) He could not he p thinldng that that observation was pregnant with significance. He had always been under the impression that it wias the manifest duty of the colonial authorities there, under tho treaty, strictly to abstain from anything calculated to violate that treaty by encouraging the smuggling trade to which allusion had been made. If that was a correct impression, he entirely concurred with his noble friend in the opinion that nothing could iustify that smuggling trade. Our obliations under that treaty were clear and positive; and, when we were vsiting the Chinese with punishment for what was a doubtful infraction of that treaty on their part (hear, hear), how should we stand if it turned out to be a fact that, while we were doing that, we ourselves, on a point of vital importance, and one in which the Chinese themselves took the deepest interest, had by means of our local authorities deliberately violated the terms and the spirit of the treaty? (Cheers from the Opposition.) He considered that was a matter of the greatest importance, and one which called for inquiry, but not, inquiry of the ldnd sugFested by his noble friend-namely, by the law officers of the Crown, whose opinion on such a subject, when their lordships got it, would not be worth the paper on which it was written. (A laugh.) He could not help sUggesting that the Government should now see that the time had come when this and other matters of a like kind ought tobe most carefully considered. It had been nnounced that a neotiator wasto ent to China virtually to supersede Sir J.Bowring, and to enter into negotiations with the Chinese Government with reference to the future conduct of our trade in that country. That announcement was a somewhat tardy one ["sHear, hear" from LordMalmesburyl and it had the appearance of having been extorted from the Government, as if those who had supported them during the recent discussions had intimated that they were notprepared to support them in retaining Sir T. Bowingi
the management of British affaira at Canton. But tardy as it was he fEarl Grey) hailed the announcement with great satisfaction, and he trusted that the name of the person to be selected would meet with the general approbation of the country andcommand the confidence both of their lordships and of the other House of Parliament. (Hear, hear.) He trusted also such person would be sent out with the view to ascertain, not only upon the matters now in dispute, but also -pon all other questions, what were the best means of establishing peaceful relations with the Chinese. (Cheers from the Opposition.) He remained of the opinion which he had already expressed, that our proceedings at Canton had been utterly inconsistent with every principle of justice and humanity. (Cheers fromthe same quarter.) But assuming the very revarse-assuming those proceedings had been as right ashe believed them to hare 'ena wrong, and that the Government could justify every step they had ttaken-still besaidtheoccurence of this Chinese war was a fearful calamity to this country and to the world; and their lordhipsought tobemost anxiouSto put an end to it. He hoped the Government in sending out their instructions on this subject were not going to be actuated by that spirit which he was afraid was somewhat too prevalentinth country-a spirit which he could not descrie as otherwise than unreasoning, and characterised by animosity and revenge, and which had been fostered in a manner whichhe for one, must strongly condemn. (Hear, hear.) He repeated that the hostilities with China had been a fearful calamity to this country and the world. He must call on their lordlhips to observe the results which those events hadproduced. On the8th of October last, when thisfnhappy occurrence. took place, we had for more than ten years been carrying on, without the slightest interr ution of any kind, the most advantageous trade. (Cheers from the Opposition.) There had been no difficultv' whatever in carryng on that trade. The commercidal facihties at the five forts were equal to thefacilities we found at Now York, or at any of the other great commercial cmpo-a in the world. We had no disputes of any consequence on the one hand or on the other. The slight grievances we had experienced had every one been redressed , and the Chinese had gone much further towards producing' ifeeling of reconciAlation than we had. Did their lordships remember that not a great many yetrs ago a distinguished Austian general was most grievously insulted and assaulted by some disreputable persons in this metropolis of England ? Urgent application waas made by the Austrian authorities for redress, in reply to which it was stated that the English Government were very sorry, that they condemned this proceedmg, but unfortunately they could not help it; that they could not discover who were the culprits, and that by the English law they could not punish any persons until proof of !their complicity was forthcomir. 'hen, however, ainnlar occurrences took place in Clins, what had hap: pened? In the blue-book lately published there was a correspondence regardlng some gentlemen who, shooting beyond the bounds assigned by the treaty, were in danger of their lives from a mob, but were protected by a Mandarin at the risk of his own lifo, some of his soldiers being wounded in repelling the assault. The English authorities, however, won dnoton that accasion lsten to anyexcuse offered bythe Chinese Government, tothe effectthat they could not findthe offenders. They said, "We must have redress, or else we will take it ourselves. Somepeople must be punished for what has been done." That was the spirit in which we had habitually dealt with the Chinese. (Hear.) Our only real grievance now was the exclusion of British subjects without the walls of Canton. Englishmen wer allowed to go into the suburbs- th were owed to go into the country, far beyond the limits fixed by the treaty; but the Chinese said they could not protect forigners inside the townL With that single exception, every thing was going on quietly at Canton. Trade had incrased so rapidly that n less than 10 years our imports had more than doubled, and a very large revenue had been produced to the country. What had been the result of our recent acts at Canton? He would not talk now of the sufferinpa of the Chinese, though he could not (as some persons did) treat with absolute unconcern the sufferings of many thousands of the people of any nation, however ignorant or however much In the wrong they might be. Passing over this point, however, he would pray their lordsbips to observe what had been the result of the attack on Canton, even as regarded our own interests. Inuthe first place a most valuable trade had been interrp ted. It was stated that the exports of tea had already
len to an extent which would entail a loss of between 1,000,0001. and 2,000,0001. to the revenue. (Hear, hear.) Besides this, there had been a vast amnount of British property destroyed thouagh he dared sa the owners of this property would finua compensation for tlas in the enhanced price of their tea. England was, moreover, embarked in a warnot' against the Chinese GovernmentBin which, as in a former case, the population were inclined on our side, but one in which, the people of China (whether with or without reason he did not stop to inquire) had been excited to so intense an animosity against us that in our own colony of Hongkong the British residents were exposed to the utmost danger. (Hear, hear.) The flame had even extended so far as Singapore, and the European inhabitants at that most valuable emporium of British trade were, as they were informed, in most serious larm for their lives and property from the acts of the Chiese there. Already, too, the Government had been compelled to have recourse to measures which must be attended with so heavy an expense that, joined to the loes of revenue from the
diminishedimlpo'rts of te-a,- it-m uas-t in-evi-t-a'b-lydis-tur-b t-he whole financial arrangements of the year, and must compel Her Majesty's Government either to check that diminution in the expenditure to which the country confidently looked at the close of the Russian war or to have recourse to that most improvident expedient, a ioan. (Hear, hear.) One or other of these measures must be resorted to, even now, at the commencement of the war. He maintained, then, that the negotiator sent out to China, whoever he might be, should receive instructions drawn up in no vindictive spirit, but of such a nature as should lead him to malo peace atthe earliest moment consistent with the substantial interests of this country. (Eear.) That was the point to which be thought theirlordahins ought to look, and he had made these remarks upon -this occasion because he thought that Parliament was not likely to sit muach longer, and becauso thiswas perhaps theonly;pportnnitYheshouldhaveof speak. upon this subject, Almost for the first time in our history, as he belioved, wo were engaged in a war -which had mot been fornally made known to their lordahs p by a thessagefromtheCrown; and which Parliament hadnot been called upon to consider at a moment when a large force was being desatched from this country. (Hear, bear.) He very muah doubted whether another instnce woeid be fonmd in which very considerable armaments had been sent out and a heavy expenditre incurred, and yet Parliament had not been called upon to support these measures ; and every one knew that before theirlordshis could meet again to discuss this subject the time would have passed by when they could do so with advantage. For these reasons he could not support any motion for referring to tho law advisers of the Crown a question which he thonght fartoa high a one to be decided by mere technical law. SBach a subject ought to bo considered by Her Majesty'a GoSmrn. ment, and by those whom they employed in China, not as a technical point of law, but upon higher principles of policy
an @.quity adas connected with the general state of our eltons wixth China. (Cheers.)
The Earl of ALBAERILE recalled the Eonse tc the sub. ject unider debate. It was not his duty to decide whether the coniduct of the Eaut Indix Company in regard to this trado was legal or Illegal, thouh, if hix noblefriend whohad brought forwardthis qestion O spoken of the impolicy of s monopoly, he should have been inclined to agree with him
onti pit His noble friend had used harsh terms to btoewho mI ht diffier from himself, and he (the Earl of Albemarle) w edl, therefore, to offer a few observations uponthis subject, more especially as he had.addre*sed large meetings in e rural districts, setting forth the social and moral evis1 resulting from the immodorate use of spiituous liquors in this country. And, firsg a few words as to thig very much abuse- commolity, opium. He con. tended that it was the abuse, not the use, of opium which was pernicious. In this respect it differed not at all from those,othernarcoties,withwhich WeweremorefawniliarinEngland-namely, ardent spirits, wine, beer, or cider. (A laugh.) Witeh regrd to opium the effects, whether beneficial or deleterious, were hut little understood. He should like to draw a oomparison, and he did not consider that it would be irrevelant to the subject, between the effects produced by opium and those produoed by the narcotics which were
sed inhs country. In the first place, the ardent spirits which were used for purposes of intoxication by the poorer Classes of this country incited to crime, while opinm incapacitated the person who used it for the commission of erme. As regarded the crime produoed by intoxication in this countr, he might cite aU the addresses of the crimisaldnegs to grand jnries in the course of their aer e r. Justice Coleridge said,-" There is scarcelya crine comes before me that is not directly or indietly caused by strong drink.". Then, again, Mr. Gurney testi.. fied that every crime had its origin more or less in drunkenness; and Mr. Clay, the chaplain to the Preston House of Corpction, assrted that -"If ever prisoner's habits and history were fully inquired into, itrwould he placed beyond be deelt with by the l,aw arises froml this Englsh smn" He: would beg their loxdsips' attention while. on the other hand, he quoted the authority of Mr. John Crawfurdt who in his descriptive history of the Indian
" The deleterious character of opium has been much in. slate upon, but generally by parties -who have had no experieueo of itae fects. Like any other narcotic or stimult, the habitual use of it Is amenable to abuse, as being more seductive than other stimulants;- bilt this is certain-y the utmost that can be safelycharged to it; Thousnds onsnm,e it without any pernicious result, as thousands do wine and spiritswithout any evil consequences I knowno person of long experience who has not come-to this common-sense conclu5ion."
Another high authority, Dr. Oley, sid that-
' The inordinate use or Tather abuse of the drug most decidedly does bring on early decrepitude, loss of appetite, and a tnorbid state of al the accretions; bnt I have seen a man who had used. the drug for' 50 years in moderation without any evil effects; and one man I recollect in Malacc
who had so used it wag upwards of 80. Several in the habit of smokinjit have assured me that, in moderation, it neither impred the functions nor shortened life; at the samne time fuy admitting the deleterious effects of too much." Anad finally, Sir Benjamin Brodie declared that-
" The effect of opium when taken into the stomach is not to stimulate but to soothe the nervous system. It may be otherwise in somue intances, but these are rre exceptions to the general rule. The opiumneater is in a passive state, atlsfied with his own dreamy condition while under the Influence of the drug. He is useless, but not mischievous. It is quite otherwise with alcoholc liquors.
Now, what was the effect produoed by thme ardent spirits employed in this country It appeared that in 78 weeks there had beer, arising from drunkenness 252 sedous ccidents, or cases o striking bodily peril, 167 robberies of or by drniken persons, 1,153 brawls or violent asaults, and 337 cases of eeulty to wives or children, and 172 murders or manslaughters. Now, all the Chinese were dram drinkers, but they preferred the milder to the stronger spirit, and, cer. tailly, if they could not get opium he beleved that drank. enessand the crimes attendant upon the drunkeness pro. duced by ardent spirits would increase, the one ten and the other a hundredfold. Much had been said about the opium being smnggled, but, even if it were, surely it wes the duty of the Chinese, and not ounrs, to prevent that taking pla, and not to give rimeto it by their stupidity in attempting to prohibit zast which it was lm ,b e to put an nend to,
ead of attempting to regulate etraffic by the establishment of moderate duties. Now was it reall true that therewas any actual smugglinR? kodoubtleal smuggling was prohibite d but virtually it was openly carried on. Sir John Davls late Plenipotentiary m China during the war and since the peace of 1852, respecting legaizing the opium trade, had remarked to Commissioner Lin, since the peace not a single eedict had bee issed againston, which was oenly rred aboutt the streets and sold like any unprohibited artide but the Chinese Government agpeared to think that it was less undignified to oonnivo siently at the practice than directly contraict all its former prindples by openly lIglizing It. LE had *aso been informed by a gentleman who had recently arrived from China that it was a common thing to see hbouring men in the purieus of Canton PlaUng with
opium, alls, which be ore the treaty would have cost theam theirlheads. Now, was such aprohibitionas the noble earl wished for to be azied out I Wa, it intendod to prohibit the growth of opium in our Indian territory ' If that were prop it would be also necessay to put in practice the medd principle which had of late unfortunately been freq,nently displaed, and to prohibit its growth in neighbounng States. The, again, the opium question was not an Isolated one. I the growth of a drug in itself comparatively innocuous was prohibited in India their lordahit7 must be preparedto doiway with the growth of thZt which produced the meoro crime-creating spirit called gin, and would the piropose to do away with two of the staple pro. ds.2ts of esrcountry-baley and oats-because people were in the habit of abusing the use of beer and gn ? If so, were Frace, Italy, ancd Spain also to be asked to uproot their vines; and was the sugacane likewise to be got rid of-for that produced rum? Here would be a loss of about 1,090,0O0. to tho revenue, and with the sugarcane the SuM duties must go, which would involve another loss of 5,000,000L of revenue. But he presumed that their lordships would not meddle with the Englsh colonies nor with their neihbour' vines, but would be content to make unhappy India the subject of legislation. But India was not the only opiun-growing country. Turkey pew opium also, a large quantity of which was consumed by the Chinese. Chia hadalso taken to growing opiurm. e had said nothing of the Indian revenue, which mnust be sacrificed if the viows of the noble earl were carried. In spite of every attempt which was made, therewas a constantl decreasingreveunoin Idia, and the subversion of the Indian revenue was connected with the success of the noble exrrs scheme. He believed it to be a complete hallucination to suppose that if the opium trade was done away the Chinese would take otr manufactures instead; because, with respect to all the articles with which the British supplied them, tbeoy had similar articles of their own, and they took the British articles
imply because they were in certain localities cheAper. They would only take as much of British articles as they needed and no more. Whenever habit had induced a people to desire a certain commodity it was not in the power of a Government or a Legilature to prohibit the general usa of that commodity. The only way to check the consumption of a deleterious article was by the diffusion of education or the imposition of moderate duties. It was now about 130 years since the feelings of the religious and benevolent portion of theo community were outraged by the increase of drunkenness in consequence of the cheapnea of ardent spirits. In an evil hour the Legisature was induced in 1736 to pas a prohibitory law in respect to ardent spirits. Great encouragement was held out by this to the common informer, who, with the revenue officers, was insulted and hunted down in the streets of London. Drunkenness and immorality increased to a fearful degree in conseqence, and the Earl Cholmondeley of that day sted (the population of the metropolis being one-fifth of Its present amount) that 7,000,000 gallons of ardent spirits wvera consued at the very timne when the Legislature declared its consnmption illegaL. In reference to Ireland the Rev. MSr. Chichcster said,-
"The calamities of civilized warfare are in general infeior to those produced by the Irish distilery hlws, and I doubt whether any nation of modern Eiurope, which is not inastatoofaotual revolution, can farnlsh instancesoflegal crnelty commensurate with those I have represented."
Such was the result of prohibitory legislation on this subject.
Earl GRANVIILE thou t that the statements which had been made to their lordahips tended to show that, with respect to the subject under discussion, various considerations must be regarded before a final determination was come to, and be rose only to make a few observations on one or two points raised by the noble earl who spoke the last but one. The noble earl objected to the course which the Government were abqut to take in referring this questionito the law offlicers of the Crown. Now, considering that the noble earl himself wa notprepared to form any opinion on this important matter, and considerig that the question had been brough forward by a noblelord representing a strlong otpitniiokn,whvethheOr riht r wrong, i3n thisb

THE SOIUND AND TRANSIT DUES.
31r. G. DUIDAS asked whether it was the intention of the Government, in negotiating tho question of the settal. ment of the Sound dues, to atipulate for the settlement ot the Danish transit dues on the same basis?
TheI CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER-A. treaty hs been negotiated with Denmark for the remission of the Sound dues by the principal Powers of Europe, #1oludiug Austri, ABelgium, France, Great Britain, Hanover?,'eck. lenburg-Schwerin,the Netherlinds, Prassia, Russia, S4*en, Norwray, and the Hanse Towns. It is anticipated that that treaty will be signed this week. It contains stipula. tiona not only with regard to the remission of the Sound dues, but also for a remission of the transit dues; anrd' although I am not able to state the precise amount of the remission of transit dues, I believe it will be not less than a reduction of four-fifths of their present amount.
NAVIGANTION OF THE DANUBE.
Mr. MAGHEiE rose to ask the First Lord of the Trossury whether he could afford any information as to the present state of the river Danubo, as far as its safe andi proper navgtion is concemed; and whether there be any reasonable hopes that the river may now be sufficiently clear to Allow of xRring shipments being made to and fror the Dauubian provmnces.
Lord PALMERSTON.-7Sir, two commi ssons have been appointed with regard to tho Danubo-the one a permanent commision, consisting of delegates from the river-bordering Powers, in ccordance with the article of the treaty of Vienna; the other a temporary European commission, composed of members deputed by Powers which are not river. bordering, but whose duty it is to take measures to keep the mouths open for navigation by removing obstructions. This last commission bas mot, but it has not been able to settle any measures for clearing away the obstructions which now exist. Some of the sand-banks within the delta have been removed, but thero is one material point now under consideration-namely, ua to which branch of the Danube is the one bost calculated to be useful for the navigation of the river. Many think that the Sulina branch is not tho best, butthat the St George's branch might be renderedso. No time, however, will be lost in making the necessary inves. tigations inddental to the attainment of the object in view.
PvE!RETIREMENT OF THE SPEAKER
The SPEAKER here rose and said:-Before I call upon the Clerk to read the orders of the day I hope the Hous
will permit me to occupy their attention for a very few momnents. (Chee) After tho statement made by the noble lord (Lord Pasnerston) to the House on Thursdav last, it is quite evident that a dissolution of Parliament is rapidly approaching; and I feel it to be only consistent with that respect whith is especially due from me to the House that I should inform them of my intention to retiro from Parlia. ment at the doso of the present session. It is now very nearly 18 years since I first had the honour of being elect
Speaker of this House; and I cannot contemplate the termination of my official career without great pain. Nor can I allow it to close without offers ing4 to the House my sincere and grateful acknow ledgments for that uniform confidence and support which I have received not only from al parties in thia House, but, I may say with perfect truth, from every iadi. vidual membor of it. (Cheers from all parts of the Houso.) I am quite aware that in tho discharge of the delicate and very onerous duties of this chair I havo had much need of that kind indulgence which has always been extendod to me, and more especilly of lto, when I have been so fres quently reminded of my incroasing inability to do ful justice to the task imposed upon me. (General cries of "No, no V") It has been my constant endeavour, as is wel known to the House, to improve and simplify their forms of proceding (choers); but at the same time I have striven to maintain unimpaired all their rights and, privileges (renewed cheers), together with all those rules and orders sanctioned by ancient usage which long experience has taught me to respect and venerate, and which I believe never can bo relaxed or materially alterod without prejudice to the freedom and independence of the House of Commons. (Choers.) If I have been in the least degree instraumental in promoting objects so desirable and so esntial to the pubec interests, I am perfectly sensible that I ove that success to the cordial co-operation which I have always received from the House, and for which I never can be sufficiently gratefuL (Loud and general cheering.)
Lord PALMERSTON.-Mr. Speaker, I am sure that I am but the faithfu organ of the feelings of every member of this Houso when I assure you that it is with the deepest regret that we have heard the announcement which has just fallen from you. (Loud cheers.) It is no compliment, no flattery to you, Sir, to say that I bolieve there never sat in that chair any man who combined in a greater degree than yourself all those various qualities which constitute the Speaker of this House (renewed choers); and with the regret which I am convincedevery hon. member will experience at losing your services for the futuro must minglo a senti ment of deep gratitude. (Cheers.) I trust that the House will not on the present occasion enter into any expression of those feelings which every man among us must entertain, and I beg now to give notice that I shall deem it my duty to-morrow, before public business begins, to move an expression of thanks to you, Sir, and also an appropriate address to the Crown bearing on tho statement which yoet have just made. (Cheers)
ORDER OF BUSINESS.
Lord PALMERSTON, with a view to faciitate the pro. gress of public business, moved that orders of the day take precedence of noticos of motion on Thursday.
Mr. MUNTZ complained of the hardship which this propositionvwould inflict on private mombers, who had very few opportunities for bringing forward important questions in whch they were interested.
The motion wasared to.

INCOMTAX BLT;L
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER moved the second reading of this Bill.
lir. DISRAELI said,-I had intended to offer a proposal to the House with respect to this Bill, but it appears from what I have read in tho accredited organs that we are noewatwaruwith China. At least, I suppose no one will deny that such is the cam, sinco wo are told that a force of 7,000 strong is to bo sent theroe; and I think, therefore, we hd better make up our minds at once to our true position, andeease to indulge in thoso droams of economy and ad. ministrative improvement which I had hoped might have been realized this year. (Hear, hear.) That hope has now passed away, and I do not feel justified in opposing the measure now before the House, as I think it is absolutely necessary that theMinisters of the Crown, to whatever party
they may belong, should have sufficient supplies for carrying en the struggle in which we aro now unhappily engaged. (Hear.) Thero is also another reason why I shouldhave felt some difficulty in proposing to the House that modification of the present rates of income-tax which I had contemplatedThe House, very unfortunately, as I think, agreed the other night to an increase of indirecot taxation, and in the face of such an increase I should be very sorry to urge a disninution of direct taxation. That, however, is a consideration ot secondary importanco in comparison with the state of our esternal relations. (Hear, hear.) The policy pursued towards China has, as I feared it would, involved this country in a war which may be of some length, and which must be necessarily attended with considerable expense. I hope that our constituents, who are continuanlly pressing upon us for a reduction of taxation, will carefully consider how far the amount of our taxation must depend uhbe system which we adopt in the management of our ex- al affairs. (Hear, bcar.) We have been at war with Persia without the knowledge of Parliament, and we have recently had the satisfcion of being informed that peace bas been concluded. So far as we can obtain any in' formnation upon the subject, these appear to be the facts of the case. The war with Persia was occa' sioned by a cause which was really too contemptible and shameful to bo mentioned. (Hear, hear.) Either that cause was the true cauee, or it was not; if it were the genuine cause, the House can at once draw the inevitabl& inference; if it were no', then it waS a part of that system which mn every quarter of the wotld appears determined todistract' this country from its domestic arrangements by a Sutbulent and aggressive diplomacy. (Hear, hear.) Admit,
Sing that the shameful cause assigned was really a pretext, and that it was not the abeolute reason for hostilities, what ccourred? In consequence of thle waw breaking out iegotiaidons, as I am informed, took place between the British and IPersiaambassadors at Constantinople, and certainterms were offered there, which we refused. (Hear, hear.) This refusar having pat an end to the negotiations, these transactions in good time, Parliament being assembled, are brought under our notice, and the feeling of Parliuenut 'with respect to the Persian war, commenced without our knowledge, being commencedin a manner not to be mistaken, fresh negotiations then occur. These negotiations are successful, but by what nieans, and in what manner ? By our accepting at Paris the terrs which we had rojected at Constantinople. (Hear.) What I wantthecountry to coneider is how much the rejection of these reasonable terms at Constantinople has cost us,-how much this quarrel with Persia has cost. (Hlear, bear.) If we take this quarrel with Persia at 500,OOO-and from what I have heard we can scarcely take it at less-and if we have half-a-dozen of these difficulties every year and average them at 500,0001. each, how is the remaining 7d. of the income-tax ever to bo taken off ? (Cheers.) Four difficulties at half-a-million each make s-p 2d. in the pound of the income-tax, and not only will tha tax remain at 7d., but we sbaU probably have the popular 9d. reintroduced to our notice in a very sbort time. (Hear, hear.) Afterthe Persian difliculty we have now the China difficulty, which may costus no one knows how mtuch, perhaps ld. in the pound of the income-tax; indeed, if we get out of it for a million wec may think ourselves very lucky. (Hear, hear.) As we are going to ithe hustings, where we shall be asked to review oexpenditure and to reduce the burdens of taxation-when we fnud our constituents complaining of the increased duties upon tea and sugar, and desire to explain how it happens that the income-tax, which was to have expired in 1860, appears likely to affect them for a longer period-let us ask them quletly to consider, before they coimplain of these burdens, whether they have sanctioned the turbulent and aggressive system of diplomacy which has drawn us into these quarrels, and which really is the cause of our not being able to reduce the income-tax in the present instance, and of our not being able to afford that still more ample relief which the country expqcts. (Hear, hear.) But, however we may disapprove ef e policy, however we may lament the expenditure which itrtaiIs, we have a clear duty to perform. We have to support the Government, of whatever elements it ymay beformed, which has plungedthe countryintoadifficulty of tbiskind. (Hear, hear.) We are now at war with China, and, however we may lament the policy which has occasioned that war, we must pursue it until an opening is afforded of bringing these calamitous proceedings to a close more consonant with those principles which we have endeavoured to vindicate in the course of the late debate. (Hear, hear.) UJnder tnese circumstances I no longer feel lustified in opposing this bill, nor, indeed, in supportig any motion which can have the effect of reducing the resources which are at the disposal of rhe Government. (Hear, hear.) I lament the necessity of the course which I have to pursue, and I indulge in the hope that the feeling of the country will at last force the Government to tursue a policy more conciliatory to foreign countries than that which it appears to me to adopt on every occasion-a policy which, while it maintains the honour, the dignity, and the true interests of the country, at the same time is not calculated to oatrage the feelings of every foreign State which is brought into connexion with us. (Hear, hear.) Then we maylook for economy, for reduction of expenditure, and for reduction of taxation; bat until a policy of that kind is adopted and sanctioned by this House and the country I am convinced that the expenditure of the country will increase, and its burdens also will increase in proportion. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. B. COCHRANE hoped that the noble lord, before the dissolution, would give some explanation of his foreign
LIcy in regard to Naples, and some assurance that our diplomaIti relations witla that country would shortly be renewed. He had put a question to the noble lord on the subject on a former evening which had not been answered by the noble lord very courteously, and when his views as to the system of Government parsued by the King of Naples had been entirAly misrepresented. No one regretted or abhorred the cruelties perpetrated under that system more than he did, but he felt that the policy pursued by the noble lord towards Naples tended very much to aggravate the sufferings of the poor prisoners.
Mr. WILLIAMS regretted that the income-tax was still to be levied on incomes between 1001. and 101., and intimated his intention to move a provisioa in committee exepnting incomes below 1501.
Sir El. WILLOUGHBY hoped that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would introduce some clause into the Bill to prevent the necessity of persons having to pay the income-tax a second time in cases where the legal co lector, to whom they had already paid it once had run away. Several cases of this sort, involving great hardships, had come to his knowledge. Some more stringent instructions ought also to be given to the Inland Revenue Commissioners respecting the disposal of assessment and other papers connected with the tax. He had in his own possession a great number of returns which had bean obtained from shops, so that it mnight sometimes happen that a man would receive his butter from a neighbouring shop wrapped up in income-tax papers containing all the details of his own private affairs, which ought to have been kept strictly private. He wished also to call the Chancellor of the xchequer's attention to the great injustice inflicted on a particalar class of fundholders who at the present moment paid at least 30 percent, income-tax. He alluded to persons who held what wore formerly long annuities, but were now short annuities. Those annuities would expire in 18G0, but the public creditors holding such securities were taxed on mcomes only worth three years' purchase equally with the possessors of perpetual annuities, worth 30 years' purchase. He thought the Government had done all they could with regard to the reduction of the war income-tax, and that they were entitled on that ground to fair consideration on the part of the House and of the country.
Major REED said he had intended to submit a motion to the House with reference to the more equitable assessment of the income-tax, but under existing circumstances he thought it would not be advisable to do so. He must say, however, as the chairman of an association which had taken up the question, that he considered it most unjust to levy the same rate of taxation upon incomes derived from fixed and funded property and upon those derived from such precarious sources as trades and profeasions. Such a mode of taxation induced many persons to make fictitious returns of income, in order to maintain their credit as traders; and the systems of assessment and appeal were fraught with great hardship. He hoped that if the continuance of this iniquitous impost should be proposed to a new Parliament measures would be taken to relieve persons deriving incomes from trades and professions from the injustice to which they were at present subjected.
Mr. HEAD-IM observed that it seemed to be supposed in some quarters that the Governient were now asking for a new income-tax, while, in fact, they were seeking to reduce the existing tax. He believed that if the House was sincerely desirous of getting rid of the income-tax the best plan would be to endeavour to reduce itwhenever the opportunity occurred, and, in order to do that, Parliamentshould keep the tax continually under their control by only grant-
ing it for a year at a time. He had intended to propose the limitation of the tax to a year, but as by the present bill the tax would only be continued for that period it was unnecessary to press his motion.
Mr. MUNTZ wished to caution the Government not to expect that the people would be satisfied simply with a reduction in the amount of this tax, which was opposed rather on aCcount of its objectionable nature than of its mere amount. In many instances the tax was accompanied with great injustice and discomfort, and in some cases it was levied in a mode which almost amounted to robbery. If the tax was imposed upon tolerably juast principles it would be less objectionable. Nobody expected to be able to make it perfect; but an attempt miyht at least be made to approach perfection. An extraordinary case had occurred recently before the magistrates of a midland county, in which a man who had been assessor of income-tax, and who had been sarcharging right and left, had been called to account, and coolly alleged that he had buLnt his books. The surveyor said it was usaal to burn the books after the lapse of two years; but ought such laxity to be permitted In the administration of a law which worked so much injustice? Some time ago, when he brought forward a motion on this subject, a leading article referring to it appeared in the leading journsal. e had no right to find fault with that article, which intimated that if he had let the matter alone it was probable the tax would have been sot rd of in three year. When the tax was imposed in 1842 it was on the understanding that it was to cease at the end of three years, but they had it now in prospect for three years, and did he not doubt it would be continued for three years more. If no attempt was made to render the operation of the tax more jus and equitable they would alw ays be told, " We can't get rid of this tax, and we must continue it as it is." Eie did not object to the tax pei- se, but ho objected to the manner in which it was imposed and collected.
Sir G. STRICf a LAND asked how thie Income-tas was to be levied so as to render it just and equitable as proposed by the hon, member for Birniingham. The tax was an odious one in itself, and its unequal and inquisitorial character could never be got rid of. All great financiors, from Pitt down to Peel, had argued that it was impossible to make such n tax pcerfectly equlitable, It was a tax suitable only for a state of war and a period of great emergency, when the people would pay it without reference to its inequalities, but it was not adapted for a time of peace.
Dr. MICHELL had never believed,and would not beliove ' now, that the income-tax vwould be brought to an end in three years. If it was imposed in the same straightforward way as the tax of 1816, there would not be so much objechon to it, but in its operation it pressed most tmunequally, and he specified the proprietors of mines and houses as two of the classes who suffered most severely, He did not object to an income-tax justly imposed, though he would profer a stamp receipt tax of 4d. in the pound, which would apply equally to all classes and to all transactions.
Lord PALMERSTON.-I cannot avoid saying a few words in reply to the observations made by the right hon. gentleman the member for Buckinghamshire at the beginning of this discussion. I thank him for the vote he is about to give us on this occasion, though I cannot say that I thank him much for the reasons he gave in support of that vote (a laugh); for he said he should vote for a continuous lncome-tax, because the turbulent and aggressive forOegn policy of tho Government might render such a description of tax necessry. What he has said reminds one of what fT ,;ve been told of a gentleman who was appointed
Justice of Canada, and who was not very learned in the law. He asked a friend what he should do, when the reply was, " Give your decisons; you are a man of good senee, and they will be right, but take care not to give your ?easons, for they will probably be wrong." (LAnghter,) I nek the right hon. gentleman what he means exactly by the " turbulent and aggressive" foreign policy of the Gover6nt ? Does he moan that the war in which re were lately engaged with many allies ageinst lZussa, and whioh was sanctioned and borne out b3y the deliberate opmioaL of the whole natlon, wI an
instance of "turbulent and aggressive" policy on the part of the Government? (Hear.) Does he mean that the peace which was conoluded at the termination'of that war wasan irshtance of " turbulent and aggressive" policy? (Hear.) Does he mean that the present state of our relatiomns,ly vhich we axe on, friendly footing with France, with Aus tri, with Sardirda, and with the United States, area proof ofthe "turbulent andaggressive" policyof theGovernment? (gear.) Does he mean that the treaty which we have concluded withthe United States,and which Itrnst will settle all points of difference between the two countries, is a proof of our "turbulent and aggressive" policy? The right hon. gentlemau reforred to the war with Persia, and declared that it arose from what he called contemptible and shameful Causes. Why, Sir, that war arose from the " turbulent and aggresiv" policy of Persia, which invaded Herat in violation of a distinct engagement which had been made with England at a former period; and every one who knows anything of our Indian empire and its inteiests must be aware that it was a matter of great importance to us to prevent Persia from acquiring dominion over Herat and the surrounding country. (Hear, hear.) I suppose, then, that the " turbulent and aggressive " policy of Her Majesty's Government rests entirely upon what has been passing in China. Itis the " turbulent and aggressive " policy of Her Majesty!s Government which bas been exemplified by the burnings, the poisonings, the assassinations, and all those crimes that havebeencom mitted by the Chinese against British residents. (Cheers.) The right hon. gentleman told us that we were about to meet our constituents, and no doubt his reference to the ' turbulent and aggressive " policy of Her Majesty's Goverrment was made with a view to the hustings. (A laugh.) But I beg to warn the right hon. gentleman that the " turbulent and aggressive" policy of Her Majesty's Governanent will not be a convenient or successful election-cry for him or his friends. (Cheers.) The people of England are too clear-sighted and to6 straightforward to be led away by any such declamation as that. (Cheers.) They know wihat are the gzounds upon which it will be their duty to exercise their franchis, and.I 'have no doubt in my own mind that they wifl give an answer to the questions put to them which will not be altogether areeable to the right hon. gentleman and his friends. (Chers.)
Mr. GLADSTONE.-I was not aware, Sir, that the discussion on the second reading of the Income-tax Bill was likely to ombrace so wide a range. (A laugh.) Subjects of great importance have been introduced into it, and the noble viscount at the head of the Government, while replying to the right hon. gentleman the member for Buokinghamshire, has addressed something like a general challenge to the House. I do not think it is the wish of any portion of the House that we should now enter upon the consideration of the foreign policy of Her Majesty's Government, nor do I desire to lead to a renewal of those warm and keen debates in which we have been recently engaged. (Hear, hear.) At the same time, as a chaUenge has been thrown out to the House, I cannot refrain from stating my own opinion that there is a very material connexion be. tween the foreign policy of Her Majestys Government and the excessive taxation and high expenditure of the country. (Cheers.) The noble viscount has referred to different branches of our foreign poHcy, and has triumphantly an. ticipated the favourable judgment of the peopie upon them. He told us that the speech of the right hon. gentleman opposite had evidently been made with reference to the hustings, and I suppose it would not be a cruol, or an unwarrantablo charge, to say that the reply of the noble viscount had a similar object in view. (A laugh.) With regard to Persia,: am extremely sorry, for the sake of fairness to Her Mfajesty's Goverment, and for the sake of the interests of the country, that Ministers bave not shown a greater disposition for the thorough sifting and ventilation of that question in this House upon a proper opportunity. The noble viscount, it is true, assures us that the war has arisen from the "turbulent and aggressive" policy of Persia, but he is aware that a very differeant opinion prevails among a great portion, if not a large majority, of this House. M1y firm belief is that a very different sentiment as to the Persian war prevails among a large majority of the people of Eng. land, and I think it is to be regretted, for the sake of justice, that the question has not been discussed in the House of Commons. (Hear, hear.) I am bound, also, to say that the course which has beenpursuedbyHerMajesty's Government, especially the withholding the estimates for the charge of the Persian war, involves a very great derogation from the rights and privileges of this House. (Cleers.) To pass to another pomt, the hon. member for Lanarkshire has expressed a great anxiety that there should be a speedy renewal of diplomatic relations with Naples. Considering the state of ignorance in which we remain after the production of what are called " Neapolitan papr s,"ignoranee not much less than that which existedefore the papers were produced,-I do not undertake to maka any recommendation, or to join in any recommendation, upon that subject. For all the proceedings with respect to Naples Her Majesty's Goverment are responsible. I have not the smallest doubt of the humanity of the motives which have prompted their course, and regret very much the miscarriage of their measures. I am afraid they, were founded upon an inadequate consideration of the diffie,ulties with which they had to deal, and I have the deepest conviction, Springing from authentic and most painful evidence, that these measures have led to no mitigation of the severest evils endured by sufferers in the kingdom of Naples. (Hear, hear.) Perhaps there never was a moment when we had more cause to deplore, in the interests alike of humanity, of liberty, and of order, the undue and miserable affictions that are endured by innocent persons in the dungeons of Naples. (Hear, hear.) I deeply regret the failure of the efforts which have been made to lighten those afflictions. I think, acknowledging the goodness of the motives which prompted them, that they wero undertaken with inadequate means and upon an ill-defined basis. There was apparently a want of adequato knowledge, on the part of those who interfered, of their own intentions, and of the length to which they were prepared to carry their interference; so that, in point of fact, as was stated by the noble lord the member for the city, either too muich was done, or too little,-too little in order to make success in the partioular instance certain; too much if we desired to guard against the great danger that attends all such acts of intervention, and that consequently affords the strongest of reasons against attempting them anlesswhen the end is evident and its attainment can reasonably be expected. (Hear.) It is not my intention, Sir, to refer to China, bat when the noble viscount makes an ironical reference to the treaty recently concluded with America, as if its wisdom and moderation vindicated the conduct of Her Majesty's Government in its American policy, I am bound respectfully to demur to the conclusion whieh he draws. I read that treaty when it appeared in the nevspapers with the greatest satisfaction. I learnt that it had been rejected in Ainerica-or, at least, that assent had been withheld from it-with the deepest regret. At the same time I cannot say that the previous proceedings of Her Majesty's Government with respect to the Central American question were such as mightbe supposed by those who derived from the treaty their -whole acuiaintanee with the subject. In my opn'ion, notbing could more unwise than the manner in wniehthe whole controversywith re ard to Ruatan and several other points was conducted. he treaty I heartily approve, because it gives up the matter in dispute by making over the island of Ruatan to Honduras but the treaty and the previous policy of Her Maicaty's Go vernment aro inconsistent with each ether, (Hra hear.) Havingthus referred to the pointsuponwhichthenoble viscount challenged the approbation of the House, I refrain from introducng aggressive matter into this discussion. We shall soon have opportunities of defending the part we have taken in the deliberations of this House, and I trust that we shall be Prepared to perform that duty without shrinking from responsibility either for our words or for our acts. (Cheers.) Let me now, Sir, make a few observations upon the Bill before the House. It was with satisfaction that I heard the right hon. gentleman the member for Buckinghamshire say that he did not intend to make any motion for the purpose of obstructing the progress of this Bill. My own view is that which was stated on a former eveningby the hon. and learned member for Wallingford. The hon. and learned gentleman, addressing the Government, said, " All we p rotest against is your standing upon your legal advantage; don't levy a 1d. income-tax because theAct happensto beso worded; telluswhattheneccs. sities of the public service are, and then we shall vote whatever taxes you may require." I think the hon. and learned genUeman put the question upon the only true, solid, and substantial ground. (Hear, hear.) I aim sorry to say that neither Her Majesty's Government nor the House have taken his advice. w e have not considered the wants of the country. They have been stated to us by the Government, but we hAve given no judgment upon them, and we are nov -I know not for what reason or with what view of public convenience-certainly in opposition to all those rules and usages of Parliament upon which you, Sir, in your address from the chair this evening, havejusdly laid so much stressaboutto votethe Ways and feausfor the year before we havo
taen into our con'sideration any portion of tho publio expenditure. My own ideas on financial matters are entirely
at variancoe with the present ourse of proedure, and are, in fact, contradictory upon almost every point to those which seem now to be in vogue. I have no wish, however, to declaim against the views or decisions of the House, but merely desire to record the sentiments I entertain, and to
rotest if I may use that term in an informal eense,' on behalf of what I regard as sound, straightforward, and, if I
may venture the expression without offence, honest mode3 of dealing with taxation and expenditure. (Hear, hear.) The hon. and learmed member for Newcastle says that we keep the income-tax under control when we vote it every
year. I differ from him. I believe that the practice of voting it from year to year is the sign of another transition, namely, a transition from solid and steady to vacillating and merely provisional finance. When did we take to this? In 1852, because we felt that we were justified by the circum. stances, for it was eminently unsatisfactory to the country. (lear, hear.) And so far from finding that the control of the eHouse of Commons was increased by the method of vot. ing the income-tax from year to year, on the contrary, that
control was diminished; and the result was this-when you voted the income-tax in 1842 for three years, and again in 1845 for three years, you voted it for three years in order that it might be made the instrument of great wise, and beneficial changes. When you took to voting the income-tax for one year you entirely dissociated
it from any such public improvementsz and you treated it merely as one of the ordinary means of meeting the regular and standing necessities'of the country. On both those grounds-becaum the annual voting of tho income-tax tends to take away the solidity and stability of our finance, and because it cripples and maims the income-tax with reference to those most useful tempo.
rary purposies for which itas-riginally propozed-I deepy regret that it should be proposed for one ningle year only
The bill which we have before ias I sa a bill pronosd entirely and exlusively apon the ruyponsblf bH I Majesty's Government, It is quite tree igthe fit isio.
gentIesai3tfie men Ber for BdeldnggamsIi&e gavi iiotioe't. the commencemeent of 'the iession. that he'would msove She repeal of the-"wr income-taxj but that notice of course, does not remove the responsibibty of Her Majests Government. And this Bill is not in point of fact a repeal of the war indome-tax; We are going to repeal, from the 5th of April onwirds, a sum of 9d. out of 16d., but thewar incometax from the 5th of Apri onwards is *Ild., aud not 9d. I am not fiuding fault with the Government for not repelaing more than 9d. On the contray, when I remember that they have made inadequate provision for tho publc service, I hold myself free to blame them hereafter for that which they have now repealed. We are nowToting ways and means before' the House has given judgment upon the subject of supplies, and it h perfectlyimpoible for independent nembers of Parliament to say what amonat they onght to vote, becanuse they have not attained a knowled2e of the standard by thich that amount ought to be adjusted'. The hon. member for Birmingham bas adverted to a matter in which I know he takes a deep interesut
namely, the reconstruction of the income-tate. Bver since mhe has been in Parlament I think he has held the same dcctrines. Ever since he has been ia Parliament those doctrines have beeni most popular. The people, if I may'say so, Dave been tickled and amused with the notion that some day or othertheinoome-tax vouldbe reconstructeda Now, what I wantto suboittothehon. fntlemasibteis,tatthnaespeeches made in popular assemblages in favour of a reconstruction of the income-tx, and of varying the rate acording to the nature of the source from which the income proceeds, abhd made as I bedeve by him as well as by many others with perfectly honest intentions, have p praotole operated as a ituswon upon the country (hear, ear); bcause wle' go on voting the income-ax from year to year, or from thtee yeas sto three years. No Government can be found that will propose its reconstruction; nor is there any memberof Parlament suficiently confident in any plan that he may have to submit it to Parliament and bring the qUeStiOn to a positive issue. Or, if there has been ny such member possessed of that estraordiary degree of onfidence inahis own tlan, ho has not received adequate encouragement tham the Honse of Commons, becsaus the Honse has alwras declined to entertain that question end has given an unfavourable reception to the proposaL I thin it would be well if, besides followinc this willo'-the-wisp proposition for a reconstruction of the income-tax, the people of this coumtry would take another question into
thear hands. I don't want them to give up its ro rcontrctionif itecnbe efftected, thoughIbeliev itanmnot; but I wnsh them to consider whetherxthey wih to haveaperpetusl uniform income-tax or nome whether reconstructed or pressingalikeuponil incomes. I mt confess that is e to
consammationth thi as t esrito me, we are rtapidly approaching. In 1853 it appeared to beperfeotly practicable to bring the income-tax to a close. In 1857, although the circumstances have altered and are more uavounrable than in 186S, yet I, in my place in Parliament, declare that I am convinced that it is still practiable to bring the income-tan to a close. (Hear, he r.) But if we are realy to bring the income-tax to a closewhich I presume is the wish of many on general grounds, and of many others who presume that it cannot be reconstructed-if we re to contemplate the attainment of that end at all, it is necessary undonbtedly that we should adopt newr rules of proeeig-that we should enter upon a consideration of the public expenditure, and of the purposes to which it has for some years been applied. I on't enter uponaconsideration of that subjectnow, bat I ventore to say that-with the state of the estimates that re before the House, and above al githa t endences of those estiinates and of the House, the Government, and the country with respect to expenditure, although it still remaius peesssible-the moment at which the bringing of the income-tax to a termination may be Tegarded as practicable is ye ryapidly psig away, andw that, u3iless we sethink and bestir ourselves, in the course of two or three years it will bhemuch too late and asheer asteof time to entertain that question, because the relation betwreen the demands of the public service and every provision for meeting them independently of the income-tax, will leave no room for maintainng the public credit and satisfying the wants oi the country except through the means which that tax provides.
Mr. MAtINS was glad that his right hon. friend the member for Buckinghamshire did not intend to offer any oppositon to the Bt, because, anxious as he wasnto reduce taxation, he was wiUing to vote any supplies vhich might be deemed necessary for the defence of the honour and interests Of the country. He wished it to b disinctly understood that, although for the purposes of defraylng the war expenditure he consented to the second readinr, he had not in the slightest degree ch nged his opinion with respect to this tax, which he regarded as an improper impost, and which ho hoped would shortlyfbealtogetherannilated It pressed meet severely upon the great bulk of the people, and eas detrimena to the heneral interests of the country He believed that it would be impossible by any legislation to meet the inequalities of the income-tax, and he did not think that it tould be desirable, even if it could be accomplished, to make the distincUton between permanent and precantous incomes which many people recommended. Hfis income, for example, derived from a precarious scource might be five times as great as that of his neighbour derived from a permanent sIutce, and he did not see, in such an event, what 3ustice there tould be in calling upon the man with the smaller income to contribute in a larger proportion than the other. Again, the income-tax yieded about onetenth of therevenue of the country, andif the principle were good for anything it ought to be applied to all branches of taxation, so that the man with a precarious income should pay a less proportion to the tea duty, the house duty, and all other species of taxation than the mal with a fixed income. The truthewas that they never could find any system of taxation which would adapt itself to the means of every person, and he had come to the conclusion that it wvas absolutey impossible by any sagacity to remove that which was termed the injustice of the tax. e agreed with the hon. batronet the member for Preston that the principle of the otax was so inquisitorial and it was atogether so inconvenient and burdensome that the middle classes could receive no greater boon than would be conferredby itsuremoval and he looked forwyard woith hope, therefore, to the period when the income-tax should be abolished. If there were not an absolute compact between Parliament and the nation in 1853 when the right hen, gentleman the member for the University of Oxford was Chancellor of the sxchequer, yet there were such expeoctations held out at that time-in considera-. tion Of the House submitting to the imposition of the succession duty-that the income-tax should cease in 1860, that he thought Parliament was bound to make every effort to fufil those expectations Still, desirable as it bmght be to remove the income-tax, he would be no party to impairing the efficiency of the public service, and he should deeply regret any economy which, in the event of our being engaged in war, would interfere with ourentering upon military and naval operations wdith a proper amount of ener y and spirit. The Bill which was at plresent before the ouse was only proposed for one year, and he felt therefore constrained, though very reluctantly to support the levying of the tax upon icomes belowv 15O. a-year, but after the present year he trusted that incomes underthat amountwould he spared from taXation. One word with regard to Naples. Last year his right hon. friend the member for Buckiaahamehire pressed upon the House the ime when of their m etmering i the affairs of inaples or of the Italian th es gener y, bness they were preared to interfere effectualy, and he stated that if they held out expectations which they would breuable to realize, they vould do the Italians the greatest possible injury. Nlow, he (Zr. Malins) was enabled to give personaltestimony to the soundness of the opinion then expressed by his right hon friend He happened to boone of the very few English in iaples in October last. He was at Sorrento on the Lst of the month, 'when he read in GcsiaZni that in a fewv days there would be in the Bay of Nap los an English and irnob squadron, and he asred the House that it was impossible to give an idea of the hope and expectation which wete raised rn that city by the anticipated arrival of that squadron. The people were on the tiptoe of expectation, and joyr glaiddened every countenance. He remained in Naples eight days, and in the interval it transpired that the hopes of the people were not to be realized. He witnessed then the extraordlinary revulsion of feeling whEich took place, and he saw what injury had been done to the people by exciting anticipations which could not be carried out. He thought it only just that he should bear this testimony to the soundness of the views which were expressed at the time upon this subject by his right hon. friend the memnber for Buckiughamabire, and he hoped, whatever Administration govetned this country In future, that it would be a part of their policy either not to interfere at all in the affairs of other nations, or to interfere effectually. (Hiear, hear.)
Mr. V. SMIITH agreed with the right hon. gentleman the member for the UJniversity for Oxford that it wras very inconvenient that such subjects as the foreign policy oE the Government should be intreduced into tile discussion upon the second reading of an Income-tax BDIl, more especially at a time when some hon. members made speeches in the hope that they might he sent back to that House, and others who did not expect to return made speeches in the nature of valedictory addresses.
MIr. MlAtINS said, that neither of those deosripEionswould apply to hini.
Mr. V. SMITH had risen to reply to the statement made by the right hon. gentleman ( Mr. Gladstone) with regard to the Persian war. That right hon. gentlemnu had
rather unfairly attacked his noble friend at the head of the Government for throwing out what he called a general challenge to the House to discuss his foreign policy. The right hon. gentleman must have known that his noble friend was but answering a challenge which had been given bythe right hon. gentleman the member for Buckingbamshire (Mr. Disraeli), who had spoken of the foreign policy of the Government as being "turbulent and aggressive." Were those epithets which it would become a Prime Minister to listen to without repudiating them? The right hon. gentleman (3Ir. Disraeli) also said that the Persian war had been undertaken for a shameful cause. Was not the noblelord justified in getting up and asserting that this " shamef£e" cause was the turbulent and aggressive march of the Persians upon Herat? A juster cause of war he (Mir. V. Smith) believed had never existed; and he should not scruple to submit to any Oriental authority who might be named the queston whether we could with safety or propriety hava permitted the Persians to mach upn and occupy Herat in defi mce of a specific treaty by wv hch they engaged to abstain from any such proceedings. The right hon. gentleman (Mr. Gladstone) had also asserted or insinuated that the Government had in some manner shrank from the discusiont of this question. This was not the case. On the contrary, so far as he (Mr. V. Smith) was concerned, he was most anxious and most desirous that the question should be diuwed. When Parliament met it was intended that these papers should be presented, and they were mentioned in the Queenrs Speeqh. wBe were beng prepared when agotiations commenea t ariR ad erMajiestys Government then wisely and pruldently, as had been shown by the saction which that oourse had received from the Hone, abstned from their prodiulest le3$-it hould interfere with the u -egt-
t16f~lo ' When kthe! ho1 member for Aylesbury (Mr.
S aa) had last asked' a question 13pon this subject, he (3Mr. Smith) had informed, him that, acting upon the ordinary, usual, and, he belioved, constant practice of Parliament the papers woula not be produced until tho treaty had DQeer ratified. It was clear that it would be imnoesible io discuss this subject without going into detalls which might lead to charges and criminations against Persia, the result of which might be to irritate the Persian Government and prevent the ratificationx of tho treaty; and it would, therefore, be most unwise to raise such a dis6lssion so long as there was any possibility of the negotiations being broken oflE The right hon. gentleman (Mr. Gladstone) had also repeated, what had frequently been asserted, that in the declaration of this war the Government haa not shown due deference to Parliament. He did not know at what moment the right hon. gentleman would have had Parliament consulted, but he (Mr. V. Smith) had already stated that the orders for the Persian expedition were not sent out until the 26th of September, at which time Parliamaent vas not sitting, and that the declaration of war wam not published in India until the 1st of October, and was not receiveda in this country until tho middle of December, at which time Parhament had already been summoned for a particular day in February. To have called it together earler would have been most inexDedient, because such a caurse would have produced great alarm. The funds would probably have fallen, and there would have been much more excitement in the countrv than could have been justfied by such an event as a war with Persia. Neither dd he believe that there was on record any inseance inwhich, in the case of a war undertaken by armies oent exrusively from India, Parliament had been caUed together for the purose of itsdeclaration The adoption of such a course VoTuld be most prejudicial to the public service. Had it been adopted in this instance the Persians would have obtained telegraphic information of the declaration of war Ion before we could have sent any expedition against them. the other eveting the hon. member for EnniiURllen (Ur. Whiteside), after he (Mr. V. Smith) had replied to a question, and therefore could not speak agasin, said that he was surprised at his answer, becanse in the course of the debate upon the capture of Xars he had said that Persia was not in a state of commotion, andthat there wasnoide0of anattackuponEerat. He(Mr.V.Smith)shook his head In denial; but, to his surprise, the hon. gentleman said that it was in vain to deny it, because it was recorded in- the pages of Hansard. He (Mr. V. Smith) was at first dumbfounded by this assertion, but he had since referred to Hansard and had found that he had stated no such thing. le had stated, and to that he sprepared to adhere, that he did not believe the Russians could be successful in an ex-
editionagainst Asia,and thatIndiahadnothingtDfoarfrom ussian agressions. At the same time he added, with a caution with which he had since had reason to be wels utisfied, that they should he watched with the greatest visilance. That was anything but what had been stated by the hon. member for Enniskillen. As regarded the discussion of this question of the Persian war, he for one should have been most glad that it should have taken place. He did not believe that a majority of that House would have declared that it had arisen from a "shameful" cause, or that a majority of the people of England would have considered it an unjst, a turbulent, and an aggressive war. On the contrary, he believed that when the circumstances were known, it would be seen that it was as just and as defensible a war as was ever undertaken by this country. He rejoieed at the eoDclUsion of peace, but at tho same time he was not sorrv tbat this demonstration had been made, because it had shown to Persa how rapidly we could plan and execute an expedition of this kind, and had, he believed, added very much to our prdetige in the East. So far bad the Government been from shirking from the discussion of this questlon that they had gone fnrther than any former Government, and had volunteered to ask Parliament to pay a portion of the expenses-the manner in wbich one could most certainly invite the attention of Parliament to any subject. The production of papers was by no means sure to lead to a disenssion, for,although the papers relating to our difference with Naples had been laid upon the table, no hon. member had taken up the subject, and there had been no debate upon it.
Lord J. RUSSELL-I do not know that it is the most convenient course to discuss the state of foreign politics upon the second reading of the Income-tax Bill; but the House has now entered far into that discussion, and I shall therefore not refrain from making the observations which occur to me. Pirst, with regard to the proposal to vote the ways and means of the year beforo the supplies. I quite agree that, as a general rule, it is contrary to practice and to what ought to be our mode of proceeding; but I think that in the present year the public would, if left for six weeks in doubt with regard to the settlement of the income-tax, have been so andious, that it was unavoidable that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should immediately bring forward his proposals with regard to it. (Hear, hear.) I believe that there will, of course, in a new Parliament, be other opportunities of discussing the finances for the three years, and I therefore think it quito unnecessary to follow the hon. member for Wallingford-(Mr. hlins) through the statements which he has made upon that subject. With regard to foreign politics, I would first say a few words upon the question of Naples. We have heard from the hon. and learned gentleman another testimony as to the inconvenienoe of the course which has been pursued. I think it is certainly more and more proved that it is not desirable, in dealing with a peopl° who are suffering, who are impatient, and wlho look to foreign assistance, to raise hopes and then not to fulfil them (hear, hear); and I therefore regret that those two great ships, the Wellington and the Cressy, names which are redolent of ancient and modern glory, should have been sent to the Mediterranean merely, to go to Malta and then back to IIsbon, 'without doing anything more. But to the proposal of an hon. gentleman that we should now resume our diplomatic relations with Naples I think there is this obvious objection, that the interruption of those coiununica. tions is the only measure which has beentaken bythe Government, anditisunderstoodasatleastamora1 protest againstthe conduct of the Kingof Naples withregardto his ownssubjects. The reason for renewing diplomatic relations ought to be that the King of Naples has changed his system of administration, and that, either by granting an amnesty, or by an exercise of clemency, he bas indicated that there is an alteration in his course of proceeding. Now, there has been no such indication. The King of Naples has byno amnesty or acts of clemenev shown a desire to improve his mode of government. The act for transporting a certain number of his political prisoners to Buenos Ayres is anything but an act of mercy. It is an act evincing, as I think, a determination to continue in the same policy; therefore I should be very sorry to see a Minister sent to Naples in order to give the appearance of a sanction on the part of Her Majestys Government to the course which has been pursued there. I do not say whether or not you were right in withdrawing your Minister; but, having so withdrawn him, it is quite a different thing to send your :Minister there again when the special ground of his withdrawal has not yet been removed by a change in the policy of the King. As to the other subjects which have been touched upon, what happened last year and in the present one has conffrmed me in the belief that no advantage to the public is to bo derived from the discussion of matters which are still tho subject of negotiation between our Government and the Governments of other countries. Iast year there was something to be said both as to the proceedings of our Minister in America under the Foreign Enlistment Act, and with regard to the island of Ruatan, and I took the libertv of advising this House, if Mr.Dallas were not sentaway fromLondon whenMr.Crampton was sent away from Washington, not to express any opinion on that subject. The House entirely refrained from any expression of its opinion, the irritation consequent on angry discusuons was avoided, and we have seen a treaty signed which we shall no doubt be ready to ratify, and which I think will be mutually advantageous to the two countries. This year, again, I ventured to recommend that we should abstain from discussng our relations with Persia while negotiations were going on on that question; and we have seen that, without any interruption on our part, those negotiations have resulted in the conclusion of a treaty between Her Majesty and the Shah. We have here another instance of the wisdom of this House in refraining from discussions on matters stiU the subject of negotiation. With respect to the merits of that war-while I do not implicitly subscribe to the opinion of the right hon. member for Buckinghamshir, I beg equally to withhold my assent from the assertions made from the Treasury bench. I donot think it sufficient to say that Herat was attacked, becauseto justify theconduct of our authorities it would also be necessarytoprovethattherulers of Herat did not give the Persian Government provocation which it was impossible to overlook; that those rulers did not without excuse assassinate the Persian Envoy - and, likewise, that no means short of hostilities, short of sending an expedition to the Persian Gulf, would have induced the Sbah to agree to terms, so far as the city of Herat was concerned, which would have been, or ought to have been, satisfactory to our Government. Whenever the papers areproduced these two points should be borne in mmd, because, I repent, it iS not enough to say that the city of Her at was assailed by the Persians. I am happy to find that one article
given Oub by a penrodical of presumed authority (the EdinBburg Revew), as necessary for the restoration of peaceful relations with Persia-via., the dismisl of the Shah's Prime Minister, has not been insisted tponOear, hear), and that, on the contrary, there are terms which, while they secure the chief objects which we sought, at the same time tend to satisfy the Persian Government that we have no
wish to interfere with their internal affairs. In regard to another question which has been adverted to, we are not at all in the same position. I have said, that while negotiations are pending it is not exedient for this House
to interfere. But wien those negotiations, such as they ma7 be, have been carried to the point of hostilities, and when the papers giving an account of those hostilities are laid upon the table, I think it is impoesible for this House not to signify bv its silence that it approves the course which has been adopted, or, if it disapproves that course
not to express its disapproval (Hear, hewr.) This House would abandon its functions if, wlhen papers were laid before it showing that hostilities had occurred such as those which lately took place in Chiaa, and when it wa unfavourable to those hostilities, itwere to shrink fron declaring ihato inion because HEer e%sty's Government had given a difrent opinion, (Hear.) hat was pro , and in very courteous terms, by the hon. member for theWest Hiding, ardvwas now adopted as the deliberate judgment of this lIouse is thbithat our authoritis at Canton were not jusffied in the operations they undertook. The decision was not, s it hs been attempted to represent it here, that Her Majesty's Governmeut have been wrong in ordering hostilitie of which they knew nothing. (Hear, hear.) It was a decision of this House that those hostilities were not justified The opinion of Her Majesty's Goyernmeut hd been eressed, indeed, in a different sense, but there was a to end of
the independence of this House (chers), an entire end of our right of judgment, if it were to be said that anv measuren, even involving hoetilities, involving the lcive of many thousands of persons, having beeapprovedby Her
Majesty's Government, this House was for ever precldeda
from giving an adverse opinion upon them (Renewod chocrs4 ) I ave no wishl to discuss the merits of this q ess tion now, but I think t'e House vwas fully justified, in the course it pursued. I certavinly understood. throughout the lae debate that the despatch of the 10th of Jarnuarv docLaring that the proceedings of Sir J. Bowring aDa our other authorities at Hongkong and Canton rrere entirely approved contained the tinal decision of Her )fajesty's
Goveranment. When pressed the other day with respDect to hissintentions, my noble friend at the head of tho Govern ment stated that tho intention of tbe Government was to send out a person not, indeed, to mupersede the authority of Sir J. Bowring, but certainly to have superior and, in fact, the chief authority at Canton, ndi to be intrusted with icertain powvers for
entsring into negotiations. Sir, I deem that a declaration of the utmost importance. (Rear, hear.) I understood my noble friend to state that this person, being, of course, a man of rank, character, and consideration, would havo first to determine wvhat orders shonld bo given for the prot4ction of the lires and property of Britilsh subjects. Any Government that possessed *he confidence of Her Majesty wrould, no doubt, give such directions, The next pnrpose waS to obtain the fulfillment of rights wvhich I we have acquired. by treaty. On that point I have only to repeat w1iat I said in the formner debate-that if it is the OpiDlOn of Her Majesty's Government that it is necessary to our relations with China that stipulations to which the Emperor gave his assent should he fulfiled, they have a fair right to pursue that objct. But they ought to do so in the usual diplomatic manner by communication-not with the Commnnsioner of Can. ton, bnt with the Supreme Governmeont at Pekin. (Hear, bear.) There is, howecver, a matter that should not
beomittd. Treaties, like property, have their duties as wellaJs their rights. If we insist that stipulations likely to be advantageous to ujs shalt be executed, wve ought at the same time to be readv to concede that the stipulations favourable to China and conformable writh her policy shall lbe executed with reciprocal fidelity. (Hear, hear.) That seems to me nothing bet plain justice. I ax sorry to refer again to the word prest ic, wich has been used to-night by mny right hon. friend (31r. V. Smith); but I hold all pras tige to be of no account which is not founuded on truth and
justice. (Cheers.) I cannot conceive that it wrould be right
to insist rngorously on treaty stipulations which you thinkc useful and favourable to yourselves, and not to agree to the enforcement of stipulations favourable to others.
Thn there is the question of the improvement of our commercial relations with China by siegotia-
tion. My noble friend laid great stress npon *t, nnd I was gclad to hear it. Nothing can be fairer or more desiable than much a proceeding. I heve no doubt that nro-
posals might be made that would be mutnaly beneflcia I greatly question whether tbe stipulations with regard to the opium trade are really advantageous to China. W^e are hound to carry them into effect if they are so;' bnt other advantages might, perhaps, be given to China in llcu of these. it is a very great inconvenience that wve should have to carry out a sort of custom-house police for other nations; and therefore I should be happy to see attemjts made by a person of character-by a dispassionate man, who should arrve out there without having hadanypartinthe ill-
blood anddissensionswqhich have unfortaatelyaxisn-pon fair and moderate terms to improve our commercial relaionawitbOhina. Thatthisshould bedonein concert with the
Government of the Emnperor of the French and with the Government ofthelUnitedStates w rouldbesomuchtis emore advantageous. (Hear, hear E I have another word to offerto the committee If Sir 3. Bowcing's despatchL of the 3d of
January had received from Her Majesty's Government a full and fair consideration, and if their answer, instead of saying that everything wvhich had been done was approved, had been this,-" No doubt you have cte wovith the intenton to defend the interests of Great Britain;* bet the matter iS of so grave a nature that wre desire v'on to suspend all further operations, and a person of eminence and character will be sent out immediately with a viewv to negotiation." If that had been done, and *adespatehto that effect had been written with the usual ability of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and had, been laa upon the table at the commencement of the
session, I believe there would not have been much differenc of opinion in this House. (Cheers.) I can only hope, whatever dissensions may have arisen-whatever difterences of opinion among parties may have been occasioned-whatever accusations those wvho gave a conscientious vote in favour of the motion of the hon. member for thc West Riding ray be liable to-that the result of all these ~prcceedings may be that, instead of carrying on a aisgrase!qul waad disagreeable kind of hostiltes in Chins, using our great power as a civilized State on the one side, and the Chinese resorting to the
modSt barbarous modes of assassination and poisoning on tbe other, the questions in dispute will be taken up in a different tone and spirnt and by a different person, and that the country w,ill have no reason to regret the debates wzhich have occurred, or that the hoe, member was successful in carrying his resolution (lIesr, hear.) Before I sit down I wish to say a few words on a subject which, though it bears on our foreign relation, is more especially connected wvith the affairs of our navy. The House is axware that the naval superiority of this country has rested in a great degree upon a certain powver which we mnade use of, in entire conformity, I believe, with the lawv of nations (hear), upon wrhich was based what was called in the last century thc rule of 1-36, and also during our tremendous contest v,ith Napoleon those Orders in Council which, however severe upon neutrals, were absolutely destructive to the commerce of belligerents. (Hiear.) During the
late war, acting inconnexionwith France, which had always taken a different viewr of these subjects, we were naturally obliged to adopt the maxtims of France,;and the principles upon which wre had usually acted were for a timne, aban-
doned. Her Majesty's Government, however, thought proper at the Conferences of Paris to enter into a general engagement, by wvhich the viewss of France and Rnssia and the neutral Powers sharing in that conferecne were confirmed and the adverse views on w hich we had always atdwere
given up. That convention was not the subject of any discussion in this House. If there had-been any such discussion I dare say the Government would have been able to showv that the state of things was such that they had no
other course than to agree to the proposal made to-them;but, however that may be, it is to be observed that in all books upon this subject it is stated that the rules- " Free
bottomsmake free goods,"and "The goods of a bell geent are sa,'e in neutral vessels, and the goods of a ncitral safe
in belligerent vessels," have always been regarded as injurnons to the supremacy of maritime countries, and espe-
ciaUly to the martiime power of England. Every one who has looked at the arguments on this subject will see that the rnles! were laid down as a blow to the mtritime supremacy of this country. Since that time the Secretary of State of the IJnited States has proposed to go a step further than this treaty-that Great Britain should agree that all merchant vessels should be free from capture during
time of wvar. It appears to me, I owvn, that, although this proposal carres with it an air of philanthropy, it is one which would not tend to prevent war. and which, if it did not tend to prevent war, would greatly cripple the energies of this country in time of war. (Hear, hear.) It is ohvious, in the first place, that one reason w hy foreign nations are unwilling to go to wr wgith this country is that they feel that their commerce is sure
toese sized, and that all the valuable proDerty which they
may have at sea is sure to fall into the hns of our ornisers as soon as ever war is declared. If, on the contrary, theyv were sure that all their merchant vessels would be aUoweed to p ass in safety one great reason for remaining at peace
would be taken away. But look also at the difference there would be in carrying on a w;ar. Suppose the United States wvere to go to war with us, There would be no impediment in the way of their marching an army into Canada, but we
should have no means of carrying on offensive operations against them. They would have no fleet to send out, they would not attempt to send one out, and there would
be no w.ar, therefore, upon the high seas. Wec should have no means of hurting our enemy. Bnt more than this-the Powecr which can send out
a large commerdial navy to sea must always have a great number of men fitted for the purposes of waor, and ready to take their places in vessels of war. It is said that we should stiUl retain the powver of blockadee, but that powver of blockAade has been limited and restricted by the
CJonvention of Paris. It must beaaneffective blockade,-
that is to .say it must be such a blockade that no merchant vessels could with safety attempt to pass through. This is so
diflicolt to attain that during the late war we were for some months withontta blockade in the Black Seam cnonsequence of the necessity of conforming to the French rule. The effect, therefore, of gour maritime law is to bloc!iade one port and to leave othorrports rmhblockdd,-that is to say. you might do great injury to New York or Boston, but all
the other ports along the coast would beablel to carry on their commercial opertifons as usual. (Hear, be.ar.) I have thought it necessary to mention this subject for mere
reasons thaAn one. I nave heard that severall nersons, some of
highs authority, and among them, I believe, the hon. member
for the West Riding, were disposed to receive this proposal with favour, and I have also read a report, it masy be an erroneous one, of aspeecli of mynoble friend at the head
of the Government, at Liverpool, in which he seemedjto lean to these viewis. My opinion is that if wve were to agree to that proposal our being a Kreat naval Power would be of no use to us in time of war. A stipulation not to use our naval
force against a commercial vessel would be a great provoca.
tion to war. (Hiear, bear.) You wounld be exposed to more
frequ ent w rs,ardt, cAudtease of humanity,wul would rot.opo meted, and in ease of wrar you would be almost helless6 upon
the seas, so that tho pourer of Great Britain weuld be verg~
much wealened. I hopo no Mnmister w ill set-his-seat htoa treaty containing any stipulations of this kind without the
most cautious deliberation, and after consulting , with naval officers and others who have had practical experince inthesematters. (Hearhear.)
Mr. DtUMMOND rose to confirm the statement of the noble lord who had just sat down as to the great advantage which this country had derived from the exercise of our
old maritime rights during the French war. It was by the. seizure of some very rich vessels which wero on their way
to Spain, either by Sir John Duckworth or Sir J. WarrVn, that Spain had been completely prevented from
putting foth her strength against this country. 'If the otrine that the commercial ships of b elligerents must not be touched during time of war were carried to its legitimate consequence a besieging army must not stopsapplies going into a besieged town, for b oth case stood exactly on the same footing. (ear, hear.)
Mr. J. G. P HILLIMORE sald the abandon ment of o ur maritime rights was the abandonment of that which continental nations must always posess-the levying of contri-
butions from an enemy's country. That was Napoleoons mode of carrying on war. That great man always maintained that the most deadly blow which oould he struck at England's power was to force her to give up these maitime rights. No better means of protracting a war could be devised than for a belligerent to deprive itself of tte power of crippling an enemy at once. (Hear, boar.)
Sir C. NAPIER expressed his hope that this country would net a hAndon her maritime rights by allowing other niontocarryoncomm ere without restion durin a
period of war. W hat w ould the consequenes of oue c a system be, sup ppg a war o ccurred betw een this countr

I
nation was simply absurd. The last war had proved what all practical seamen would toU them, -that it was impDssible to maintain an effiective blockade in tho winter season. Steamers could leave ports when they pleased theo could get to seu on dark nirhts, and thus trade might be extenxirely carried on by our enemy, 'hilo it would be ncessary for this country to keep up an immense mavy to ittempt the maintenance of an inefficient blockade. It *as the dread of the British navy which mainly deterred other nations from going to war with us, but if tho efficiency of that safeguard were diminisbed foreigners would rather be at war than at peace with this country.
Mr. COBDEN thought it would be generally admitted thLat it was somewhat inconvenient to launch into the discussion of such an important question without provious notice. He had supposed they were about to consider the income-tax, but the noble lord had introduced a very wide question (a laugb), which would engage tho attentioni of the House on a future occasion. Ho (Mr. Cobden) altogether differed in opinion from the noble lord, and he merely rose to saa so, that it might not be supposed there was a'general acquiescence in the noble lord's viows. He thought tho hon. and learned gentleman (Mr. Phillimore) had treated the question on a ground which was altogether fallacions, becauso this country had already abandoned its belligerent nghts at the treaty of Paris. Tho question they would hereafter have to discuss was whether, having taken that irrevocable step, it would be advisable to go a step further in the direction indicated by Mr. Mrcy, and altogetber to exempt private property from capture at sea in time of war. He did not intend toro into the auestion on that occasion, but he thought e. would be ablo to urgo arguments, based upon our present position, that were calculited to chango the noble lord's opinion. The bon. member for Tynemouth had given notice o his intenhon to move for the papers relating to the treaty of£Paris, and for Mr. Marcy's letter, and h gthe tMrCbeaty
ke(h!r. Cobden) hoped that when those papers woere laid offcially before the House the hon. gentleman would found a motioh upon thein,which wrouldafford an opportunity of fairly discussing
th question.
Mr. NEWDEGATE expressed his deep rogret that the articls of the treaty of Paris purported to debar this;country from exercising the powers it had hitherto exercisod bv menns of privateering and letters of mark. He hadexaLminecd the returns laid upon the table, and he found that, far from those powers baving been misused, there was most direct evidence that they had been exercised in the most legitimate manner. Parliament had revived the militia and ahad thus rendered unnecssry the mainlonance3 of Ia enormous standing army, and if they meant to relieve tho country from the necessty of maintaining at enormous 4expense a le otUdsr. portioned to the requitremoents of p they ought not abandon the right this country had so longexercised of arming her naval militia for the prosecution of any war i which she might b n ed e entered his protesagst thoe provisions of the treat of Paris whichprotdt,erv tho country of that right.
Mr. ILNES thought it would be convenient to proceed as soon as possible to the motion "that this Bill be commnitted" in order that an opportunity might be afforded to the nole lord (Palmerston) of explaining the statements he was alleged to have made atLiverpool. The foreign Policy of this coountry would be brought prommnentl~' before the peo le at the approaching elections, and it sWas the policy of the opponet othe Government to encou~rage the idea that the no0bl lord was the reAl disturber of the peace Of Europe. (A laugh.) Hitherto it had been leftt to low journals on the continent and to persons ignorant of tho
real Om ofaffairs to attack the motives and piinciples whie'h animated the noble lorad's continental Policy' hut it now seemed that hon. gentlemen opposite thou!iit they could in that policy find a useful weapon against the Government. Be(hlr. Milnes) was sure the good sense of the English people would prevent them froma beingdeluded in suca a manner. The country would see that the noble lord had followed on this occason the course he had always pursued-that, while maintainzng the prescriptive rights of England, he had endeavoured by all just and honourable means to promote the cause of liberty throughout the world. (Hear, hear.) It appeared a somewhat difficult matter to pleasethe right hon. gentleman (Mr. Gladstone) with regard to the affairs of Italy. The right hon. gentleman. had, iu the first instance, by bis admirable pamphlet, excited the public interest on that subject and the good that had been effected was mLinly attributable to his exertions. Be (Mr. Milnes) thought, therefore, it was scarcely fair on the part
of the right hon. gentleman to turn upon the Government
because, in prosecuting the same policy as he had virtuay recomrnmended-inpearrying out the same principles of justice andhumanity-they had not always been successfuL It ws no fault to have failed of succss in dealing with Buqh a man as the King of Naples; but he believed the people of Englaun were of opinion that the Governments of France and Englind bad been right in declaring that the cdmnduct of that mbnarch excluded him from European comity, and that, without pDroceeding to actual hostilities, they were justified in saying to him, "We wil not hold intercourse with you on common grounds, becanse we regard you as a disturber of the peace of nations."
Mr. WHITE1SIDE could not listen in silence to vwhat had been said with regard to the foreign policy of tho noble lord. Was it possible to reconcile the policy adopted at the Paris conferences in relation to Belgium with the policy pursued towards tho King of Naples? He spent some time in Belgium last autumn, and he there loarned with what surprise the course adopted by tho Ministers of England w,th reference to the freedom of the press in Belgium was regarded. He found that a speech delivered by the right hon. member for Oxford University upon thakt subject had teen translated and was generalUy read and uniTersallyadmired. He (Mr. Whiteside) must confess that the polioy of interfering with a free country because it was free, and with a despotic country because it vas despotic, was to him utterly incomprehensible. He would like to hear the hon. member for eontefract (Mr. Milnes) reconcile his general observations upon foreign policy with the events that had occurred. If they had a right to interfere with a bad Government at Naples, what were they to do with the Pope of Rome? Naples did not interfere with ether States, but the Pope of Romo did. There were other States in Europe that might be interfered with on the same ground; but of course it was not the intention of the Government to do so. He did not believo that the noblo lord had anY desire to make his policy triumphant in Europe, but that hlis object was to make
liticalcaital in this country. (Hear, hear.) Did any-
ym spposo that if the Americans were to attempt to reVIve the slave trade they would be seriously interfered with by the British Government2 (HEar, hear.) No * they would be perfectly civil to them; but they interfed with Naples on the simple ground that it had a bad Government. It might be the object of the noble lord to establsh the govermment of justice and rational freedom aU over the world; but what would he do with the friendly Bmperor of Austria? (Hear, hear.) What with the Emneror of Russa? (Bear, hear.) The noble lordmust ab3tathese nuisances of despotic Governments wherever they were to be found, and then, but not till the, would he be en3titled to the panegyric of tehn gentlemanL opeosite. (Hear, hear.) The poli tof th noble lord in mterfering with foreign States was incomprehelisible and impracticable, and it was a pohly which hc had no intention of carrying out, for if he meant to fight the battle of freedom in Italy the only sensible course would be to land 20,000 men on its shores. (Hear, hear.) He thought the despotic nations of tho world should be loft to the slow operation of events; and much as he objected to arbitrary power, his decided conviction was that any English Minister who attempted by direct means to limit it would not diminish, but only aggravate the eviL (Hear, hear.)
Sir F. KELLY expressed his surprise that no member of the Government had risen to address the House on the subject to which its attention had been drawn by the noble lord the member for London,-viz., the question of our maritime supremacy. He trusted that no Minister of the Crown would ever be induced to enter into a treaty with any State in the world with the view of carrying into effect those viiews that were said to have been developed by the noble lord at the he.ad of the Government in a speech delivered by bim at Liverpool, and thus to strike a blow at the naval supremacy of this country. (Hear, hear.) The noble lord, he hoped, would takc the earliest opportunity afforded him of addressing the House on this subject, and, if necessary, he would move the adjournment of the debate to enable him to do so, for he considered it of cssential importance that the Hlouse should know what were the intentions of the Government on this question before any step was taken that, like the convention of Paris or the late proceedings in China, would be foxnd to be irrevocable. (Hear, hear.) As to the Bil before the House relating to the income-tax, he would not resist the socond reading, because if they did not assent to some Bil the war tax ofls. 4d. in the pound would be continued. but before the BiU passed Ike would take the sense of the Hfouse on the question whether or not the understanding come to between the Government and the country by the Act of 1853 was to be deemed a permanent arrangement or contract? The whole time of the debates in 183, wlhen the Act was passed, showed that the arrangement was of the nature of a contract. If the Government were able to sh
from the estimates that there realy existed an. absolute necessity for the proposed increase of the income.tax from 5d. to 7d. in the pound, he, for one, would be satisfied, but if theyjpersisted in going into committee on this Bill before the Estimates had been before the Honso he would most certainly take the sense of the House on the question that the income-tax be 5d. in the pound, according to the terms of the Act of 1853.
The CHANCELLOR of tho EXCHEQUER.:-..Before referring to what the hon. and learned gentleman has said on the subject of the income-tax I will answer his question with respect to tho point which has been raised by the noblo lord the member for the city of London., In consequence of tho convention that was entered into at Paris with regard to maritime rights a communication was made to the Govornment of tho United States
asIcing them to aocedo to the convention. The ansirer mado by that Government was that, provided a certain ulterior change was added, thoy would be prepared to becomes party to the arrangement. That ulterior change consisted in malking the goods of an enemy carried in merchant vessels free from seizure in time of war. (Hear, hear.) &o answer bas been made to this proposition. It is under the serious
considerWtion,ef the Government, who are folly. awar oE its importance, and they wil not como to any eonolusion on the matter without a full consideration of all the interests involved in it. (Hear, hear.) The hon. and
learned gentleman mado some remarks on the subjet of the income-tax, and aid be would takethe sense
of the committee as to the fulfilment of a conirtct which hle sayS waS entered into by the Act of 1853. I am not quito sure that I understand what is the nature of the contract that that Act is supposed to have established; but if there was a contract the first departure from that contract took place in 1854. when the income-tax of 7d. in iho poand vas doubled on the proposition of the rigt hon. Kentleman the member for tho University of Oxft .d; and therefore if any alteration of the original terms of theAct is to be
counted as a dviation from the contract he 'must be considered as hang been thefiratto pull thekeystone from his own arch. (XIear, hear,) Bct I cannot consider that we in any wy volted the ontaot whe lMNNdiesoe
to the necessities of the thne we made an alteration which was demed. to be advantageous, and,n&deed, necessary for the conduct of pubUc afir. (Hear, her.) In the present
ear the Act, if enforced, would enable the Goyemment to levy an income-tax of Is. 4d. in the pound, and that part of the Act of Parliament ia violated, accordin$ to the hon, and leaned gentleman. But that is a violatioui which will take place by Act of Parliament, for it seems to me that one Act of Parliamont cau constitute just as valid a contract aus a previous one. I cannot distinguish between the validity of the two Acts. (Hear.) AU I ask is that we repeal so much of the existing Act as relates to the current year. For the ensuing year I propose no alteration, but leave the matter entry open to the consideration of another Parliament. (ear, hear.)
Sir F. KELLY did not consider it any departure from the contract to increwe the income-tax for the purposes of a war. It was only now that the war was over that he considered there was a breach of contract.
Lord H. VANE ws always disinclined to increase the burdens necessarily imposed upon the people, but at the close of a great war it was, perhaps, too much to expect that the expenditure should immediately return to ita former comparatively restricted amount. He hoped, however, that in future tears endeavours would be made to bring the expenditure within the compass of the ordinary revenue.
The motion was then agreed to, and the Bill was read a second time.
SUPPLY.
JUpon the motion of Sir C. WOOD, the House resolved itsel into Committee of Supply.
Sir C. WOOD waa about to address the committee, when MbIr. GLA.STONE observed that he had accidentally allowed the question that the Speaker do leave the chair to escape him. He wished to know whether it was competent for himn to ke the motion of which he had given notice for a revision and further reduction of the expenditure of the State ?
Sir 0. WOOD said, the right hon. gentleman's notice was upon goin intoCommitteeof Supply. Thatqueetionhadbeen put, nd the louse had gone into committee. It would be better, therefore, to prooeed with the business of the cominittee.
Mr. FITZROY remarked that the resolution of the right Ion. gentleman the member for the University of Oxford was one that could not be proposed in Committee of Supply.
Sir C. WOOD said, he had given notice of his intention to move a Committoe of Snpply and he had done so, and was, he believed, entitled to proceed.
Mr. GLADSTONE explained that he had omitted to zuove his resolution at the proper moment in consequence of his attention having been engaged by an hon. member. Three motions which stood before his own had been withdrawn, He hoped, therefore, the right hon. baronet would waive his privilege and allow the House to resume, in order that he (Mr. Gladstone) might make his statement. He had no disposition to interfere unneoessarily with the progress of pubUc business, and therefore trusted that his request would he acceded to; but if the right hon. geutleran stood upon his privilege it could not be helped.
Sir C. WOOD was sorry to stand in the way of the ght hon. gentleman, but did not think it was desirable to delay the progress of public business. The right hon. gentleman had already that evening addressed the Eouse at some length, and he (Sir C. Wood) hoped he should not be considered discourteous in proceedmng with his statement.
Lord J. RUSSELL bore witness that it was by no fault of the right hon. member for the University that he had allowed the motion for going Into committee to escape him. Ile (Lord J. Russell) had gone to the right hon. gentleman to inquire whether it was his intention to bring forward his mnotion, and it was while his right hon. friend was replping to that inquiry that the motion for going into committee was made. Under those circumstances the First Lord of the Admiralty could, of course, take his own course, but as a matter of courtesy, perhaps, he would give way to the right hon. gentleman's requegL (Hear.)
Sir C. WOOD imputed no blame to the right hon. gentle. man for not making his motion at the proper time, but thought it for the convenienoe of the House and the pubhc that he should proceed with his own statement.
NAVY ESTIMATES.
Sir C. WOOD then proceeded to say,-Sir,-I do not propose to detain the House at any length upon the present occasion. I believe It is the wish of the House to grant votes on accoumt and no more, therefore any lengthened statement from me at present is unnecessary. When the rhole votes are taken and the whole estimates are before the new Parliament wll be the proper time for a fuU and complete statement. I propose now only to take sums on account of each vote, equal to about one-third of the whole amount of each item. That will cover a sufficient time after the probable meeting of the new Parliament to allow ample and complete discussion of the whole estimates. If the House wishes me now to make any lengthened statement I will do so, but otherwise I will proceed at once to the various items. There is only one point which I wish to mention specifioally, and that is in regard to the number of men required for the public service. I have not been able to reduce the number of men employed to as great an extent as I desired; but that has mainly arisen from indisposition of the seamen to leave the serviee. (Hear, hear.) A large proportion of men in our navy consiSts of continuous service men, and, although we have paid off every ship which has served her time, the number of men is still higher thn I had wished it to be. Only the other day the Dauntless (as we understood) was paid of; and every man on board was a continuous service man, and, although the whole ship's company waS paid off, not a man left the service. (Hear, hear.) More than that, the old seamen when their ships are paid off, before taking the leave to which they are entitled, enter their names upon the books of the flagship, and still continue in the servioe. Censidering that these are old men-of-war's men, I think that the House wiU agree that we did right in not turning them adrift when they desired stiU to remaln in their ountry's service. (Hear.) This must be a gratifying tirounmtance to the nation; but, at the same time, it Will explain why so large a reduction as was intended bsA not been made. No ships have been commissioned except for the necessary relief of others whose time of service has expired, andevery means has been takento reduce thonumber of men employed as fr as practicable, having due regard to the valuable old seamen whom I have mentioned. I have no other point to mention now, but am ready to answer any questions which hon. members may wish to put to me.
Upon the vote that for the four months after the 1st of April next the number of men and boys employed in Her Majesys naval and Coastguard services should be 53,700, including 15,000 Royal Marines,
Mr. W. WILLIAMS had intended to move that the army and navy estimates should be referred to a committee, but, under present circumstances, he would not do so. He stiUl believed, however, that great advantage would result from the adoption of such a measr It was not uncommon, for example, for several items to be lumped together in the estimates, and one vote to be taken for the whole. A committee of the whole House could not scertain whether al the items were correct or not; but that duty could be efflicently performed by a select committee. In the course of one year, as stated by an auditor, 32S,0001. had been expended in excess of the sum voted. That also indicated a state of things which ought to he inquired into by a committee, There were several votes in the present estimates which he thought extravagaut. The marine force15,000 men-was too large as compared with the number of seamen; and he saw no reason why there should be 32 gonerals of marines, seeing that they had no duties to perform either on land or on board ship. He did not deny that the marines had been a useful body; but they were not now so efficient as they once were, in consequence of the introduction into the fleet of long-range guns. Formerly there were only two geneTals-one a naval, the other a military officer, He objected also to the large amounts required for stores and new works in the naval yards. During the last four years 9,800,000. had been expended for stores, and the committee was now asked to vote 1,395,0001 8ince the termination of the French war nearly 12,000,0001. had been expended on the naval yards, and here was an additional demand of upwards of 500,0001. The sum paid to the labourers in the same establishments was quite disproprtioned to the mounts asked for stores and neow works. He thought the number of admirals should be redluced as soon1 as POssible. We hAd an admiral for every ehip in the service.
Sir H. WILLOUrGHBY was not prepared to say that the estimates, with one exception, were extravagant, or could he much reduced. He wished to know, however, what was to become of theexcessof 2n,0001.inthe lstyear? No 1ss a sum than 828,0001. had been expended without the authority of a vote of that House, but solely on the authoxity of the treasuer under the Atpropiation Act. That was a variation which surely oug t to have received the confirmation of the House. It was true a larger aum was taken for men than wasspent in the wares of men. and
vas a saving in that and other respects There was,
in point of fact, 620.0001. whioh hadzi not been spent as ap-
propriated by the House. The authority of the House would be oompletely set addse in these matters unless some
change took place. He trusted the Government would see the necessity of placing such enormous departures from the votes of the couse as he had mentioned under sonie proper chek, fo* otherwise it was perfectly idle to
vote estimates in the ordinary way. Then, with respect to the audit of these aoounts, how did the House stand? The auditor explined the authority he had over the
accounts, and in so doing made a most remarkable declara tion. He stated that, supposing he found that a sum of mnoney had been spent againet the provisions of an Act of
Parlament, or agadi3t an order of te TreasTy or an order
or supposing he discovered t asum of money dbeen expendea twice, no error of that kind, however palpable, came within the scope of his powers The supposed audit would, in point o fact, appear to be no audit

Sir C. NAPIER said, he did not think consgidering we w rere likelyto have a Chinese war, that 53,700 was an extn.vagant number of men to vote. On the contrary, he should bavie been glad to wee the vote a little larger, because 5,700 of thoee aen were to be employed in the
Coastguard service, and oould net therefore be axid to increase the efficiency of the na'7.. He should like toknow,
however, how many of the remaiing 33,0D0 men were whLat was ealled "continuous service men," and how many were

at the present moment, for iu times of peace they would f.,rm efficient garrisons in seaport towns, and in the event of war nmight e ularched ou board ship, while the militia might be *ait to replae them in garrin., T hon.member
for Larubeth had complained that there were so many generals of marines, not one of whom was eamployed. He (Sir C. Napier) regretted It wau not the custom to employ them, as some of: them were young enough for service, and they mi*bt be usefully employed in commanding garrisons in saports manned by marines. With regard to the continuous service uen, he understood thoy were not always quite so fit for service as they ought to be. They were entered for 10 years, and it was proper the Government should keep faith with them; but it often bappened that they were not a good class of men, snd not likely to be useful to the service hereafter. He should therefore suggest that before a man was entered for 10 years he xhould be submitted to a probationary service for one year. It was of the utmost importance that some regular system shoald ba established of manning the navy, and.if they wished to have that great branch of the public service efficient when war broke out they must commence in time of peace, In Russia, France, Holland, and other countries there were well-organized methods of manning the navy, and unless England also adopted something like a system In the matter the day would come when xhe would reap the evil consequences of her negleot. They might depend upon it that we were not safe in leaving so important a subject to chance, and he urged upon the Government that, taking warining by what occurred during the last war, they should adopt measures which would enable them to fit out a fleet wit the greatest alacrity; and he should be very happy to
ve al the assistance in his power towards carrying out so tairablc an object. (Hear, hear.) He had given notice of his intention to bring under the notice of the House the speeches of the hon, member for Tamworth at Stafford and elsewhere relative to Cronstadt ; but, as he believed that it was the general desire that a disolution should take place with as little delay as possible, he would not occupy the House with matters personal to himself, and would leave the hon. baronet to play out his vagaries before his constituents. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. W. S. LINDSAY complained of the large amount which appeared in the estimates under the head of new wvorks; bUt he said that the fact was that every succeeding Board of Admiralty had notions of its own to cary out, and that what one Board recommended another countermanded. He had met with a ludicrous example of this the other day at one of Her Majesty's dockyards, wbere he saw some men engaged in pulling down a magnificent pile of buildings He inquired of a person who appeared to be the head of a department what was the meaning of the proceeding, and the man's reply was, that he didn't exactly know, unless it was that the last lords liked the Elizabetbau style, and the present preferred the Corintbian. The man might have intended this for a joke, but there was a good deal of truth in the observation, for it set forth the system to which he had alluded. He hoped that next year a committee would be appointed to inquire into the whole subject of the navy, and that the result would be the appointment of one responsible, permanent head, in lieu of boards changing with the Administration. Manning the navy was undoubtedly an important and a difficult question, but he was persuaded t.hat they must never depirt from the voluntary system.
Sir G3. TYLER agreed with the gallant admiral opposite, that unless some thorough system were established for the future marning of the navy, we should always in an emergency be deficment of seamen. He recommended that a force should be established of coast volunteers, paraking of the nature of a marine militia force, from which the navy might be recruited. Last year there was provision for 5,000 naval coast volunteers in the estimates, but they had disappeared from the present vote and altogether there was a great reduction in the efficiency of the naval force. If economy were to be practised it ought to be inx uome other branch of the service otherwise the navy would never be in an effective state wehen it was required. We could not agin recur to the sstem of impressment, butsome means should be adopted by w^rhich men could be obtained whenever they were wanted. He wrould receive boys inalsost any number, and he regretted that there should be any reduction in the estimkates for the na-ral coast volunteers.
Sir C. WOOD, in reply, said, his hon. friend the member for Lambeth (Mr. W. Williams) had adverted to the number of maines kept up. The answer of the hon. and gallant admiral (Sir C. Napier) to these remarks was just that which he should be inclined to give. The Admiralty hoped to establish before long a large reserve of good and trained seamen, and there must at the same time be a eorresponding number of marines ready to serve afloat. When this system was brought into full operation they would be prepared, at any emergency, to man a larger number of men-of. war than they had at any time heretofore been enabled to do. As to the Generals of Maines, their retirement was settled by an order in Council some time ago, and it Ws not a m:tter over which the Board of Admiralty had any authority, Then the hon. gentleman complained that the vote of stores was very large. So it was, in oonsequenoe of one or two Items only introduced into the estimates of late years. For example, the substitutIon of steam for a sailing nary had entailed an enormous expenditure (200,000.) for coals. Another large item was the purchase of steam machinery. Hon. gentlemen were hardly aware of the enormous inreas of expenditure entaUed on these and other heads. We were, in point of fact creating a steam navy, and he hoped before long England would be in the same relative position with regard to her steam navy as she had always been heretofore with regard to her sailing navy. (Hear.) At the present uzoment we were not in that position, though he would not now go into details on the subject. We did not possessthat superiority which as the first maritime nation in the worldwe ought to have nd therefore a considerable expenditure mnust be looked for for some time to come under the head he badlastamentioned. Sowithregardtoworks. Thegreater sise of ships at present created the necessity for considerable alterations in our docks. Thus, there not being a dock in the Queen's yards vwhich would take in the Hminal
one of the finest vessels in the service for the transportof troo it was found necessary, in the course of last summer, tota . dowuthe head of the newest dock they had in order to prepare ccommodation for this vesseL A large American frigte, the Merrimac, came to this country the other dav, and had doubtless been seen by many hon. members. Wenl, there waa only one dock in the kingdom which could take in that vessel. His hon. friend would see that, if the nary were to be maintained Inu n efficient state, they must have the power of docking ships of this class. Hear, hear.) Theohon, and gallant admiral (Sir C. Napler) had asked how many continuous service men there were, and how many "novices " The number of continuous service men was, in round numbers, 2500. As to the other class alluded to, although the men were entered as novices, and were regarded as such as long as they were kept in the trainIng ships, they were not sent alioat until they could be rated as ordinary seamen. There was no intention to diminish the number of bows; on the contrary, the Admiralty felt itmost desirable to reep up a fnUl number of youths, whoseearly training afloat rendered them afterwards highly efficient and valuable. (Hear, hear.) The hon. andgallant admiral had alluded to the compulsory service. No doubt, the French and Russans in this respect possessed means of sending men afloat which we did not possess. He believed, however, that, with the reserve of seamen and marines, combined with the number of men to be drawn from the merchant service, they would be able in future in time of war to man a larger number of vessels than they had ever been able to send outheretofore. (Hear.) HEe should be very sorry to be driven to impressment; nothing but extreme necessity and danger would justify resort to such a system; but it must be remembered tbat, if compulsory service were surrendered, a substitute must be provided, which would naturally be attended with expense.
her.) The country must pay for giving up the rorce setvice, and the system of reserves now adoated Ws he believed as cheap a one as could be devised, while at the samne time it would place this country on such a footing that we need not be afraid of being caught nprepared on the breaking out of a war. The hon. and gallant officer (Sir G. Tyler) appeared to think that the efflciency of the naval coast volunteers was diminished in consequence of someproposal made by the Admiralty. He (Sir C. Wood) was not aware to what the hon. and gallant officer alluded, because, so far from doing anything to diminish, they were taking measures which would increaso that efficiency. He quite agreed with the hon. and gallant officer that the stationing of sps of war at different parts of the coast would be conducive to the popularity of the service. Instead of distributing the naval coast volunteers among six districts, the Admiralt7r now proposed to divide the coast into as many districts as there were coast-guard dIsticts and to take the naval coast volunteers to those stations for the purpose of being drilled. The largest number of naval ooast volunteers raised was on the east coast of Scotland. Preparations had been made, and orders issued for drilling them, for the first time in the course of next month, and Captain Fraser, who had been on that station for two years expressed the greatest confidence In the success of that ex riment. As to the story related by the hon. member for Tynemouth (Mr. Lindsay) he agreed With him that is must be a joke. Where the ococrrence happened he did not know; he was not aware that any great building ad been pulled down tor the purpose of substituting one stle of architecture for another; and, forhis own part he certanly bad not the slightest preference for the Ccci ov
Elizabethan order. (laLugh.)ha oe h
Mr. COWAN observea that a considerable sum of money was asked for slips at Bermuda, Pembroke, and Davonport, and he should like to be informed what principle those slips were to bebuiltnupon ?
Sir G. PECHELL complained of the inefficlenoy of the naval squadron on the coast of Cuba as compared with what it would appear to be from the eatimates. The slave trade bad been repressed on the coast of Africa, and also on the coast of the Brazils, ind there was no reazon, now that the war was ternuated, why a sufficient force should not be employed to suppress that traffic on the coast of Cuba.
Mr. BOWYER, as a memborof the committee that gatlast session on Pablic Ioneys, testified that the system of auditng the public accounts was very inefficient. The Board of Audit couldmerely take cognizance of the fact of certidn payments having been made - but they ought to have the
wer of investigating their leegality. He hoped thatthe First Lord of the Admiralty wold give an answer to a question which the Liverpool Financial Reform Association had requested him to nt with regard to the shi called the Royal Frederick, which was a three-docket, and kad been on the stocks at Portsmouth for 20years That ship, which was kept on the stocks 10 years after it was ready for lannching, was about to be converted into a 130-gun steamsbip. The comsnittee eught to have some satisfactory explanation of the detention of a ship of that size so long in a state of idlenes. He wished to know what was the total cost of the vesel, and also whether, when her keel was laid, petty offlcers were appointed to her in the usual manner, and had boc kept on pay from that time till now.
Admiral WALCOTT observed that as the navy estimates had been reduced to the extent of 3,000,000W. It bec,me the du of the Admiralty to take especial care that the number
ofships in commission should be sicletly lage to enable us8to maintan our position in the event of an outbreak, Effciet oficrs ugh tob eletedforthoese ships; and evey econa,~men gvenso he eamn.He was glad to hear fromthe r@s;tLbord of° the Admiralty that the naval serviGe was at present in so much favour, for he (Admiral
Waloott) had endeaowred all his lie so to improve the condition of the seama as to make the servie attactive. He suggested the dedrabloneg of providing the navy with some sort of wniform-the more simple the better, and of extending to the rnaval cadets a ystem of training similar to that which w rci on board the ship Industry with the most beneficregstforyoungboyx destined for the navy. He had been on board that hip -for th t of wbich for the purpoaes of tralnin the First Lord of the Admiralty deserved the gratitude oR tbo country-and was highly gratified wi the system. He trusted that the Admiralty would speedily adopt a training system for the better instruction oS naal cadets in their profession.
Admiral BERKELEY said, that there wa a general uniform throughout the service, and naal cadets would be tained in ships such as the Illustrious before they were sent to sea. It was true that in the system of continual service rnen there had been, as tbere would be in all new systems, some difficulty. Some of those whowere enterod as boys did not grow up sufficiently robust to make able seamen, and were complained of by ome captains The Admiralty were now endeavouring to devise a pa by which such boys should be got rid of. Had the committe gone into these estimates, and had any attempt been made to reduce the number of men, he should have felt it his duty to state in the mnost distine. terms that the reduction of the number of men now voted would be the piratest blow that could possibly be given to the British navy. (Hear, hear.) He had taken the greatest possible pans to rke bimself acquanted with all the details of the manning of the navy, na he could assure the committee that owing to the change of our mantime laws, and to there being another nation seaking the same lnguage as ourselves, without any distncte mark, it was and would always be difficult to man the nav properly. The right hon baronet the member for Carlisle (Sir J Graham) paid great attention to this subject, and many of his plans for manning the navy were now oelng acted upon. At ona time be (Admira Berkel6y) fancied that the coast volunteer scheme, a child of his own, would be a failure; but he was happy to be able to tell the committee that he now had reason to believe that in any futuroe war we should be able to draw a large body of men from the navalcoast volunteers. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. P. W. MARTIN expressed an opinion that the labourers in the dockyards were too highly paid.
Mr. BENTINCK asked whether it was intended to mako Any improvement ir the arrangements for the coaling of ships in Plymouth Sound?
Admiral DUNCOMBE recommended the enforcement of a regulation to prevent the use of steam by auxillary steam vessels except in cases of necessity. Captains were generally too much disposed to use steam and neglect their sails.
Admiral PECHELL concurred with the hon. and llant admiral that economry would be gratly promoted by the enforcement of a regulation restricting the use of steam to cases of urgency. He bore teetimony to the activity and eal displayed by the First Naval Lord of the Admiralty (Admira Berkeley) in manning the navy, and expressed his opinion that the crews of Her Majesty's ships were now so wall off as to par, provisions, and treatment (in dl of which respects their condition had been much improved dnce he was on active'service), that there was now no danger of their deserting to foreign ships. (Hear, hear.)
Sir C. WOOD gnite agreed with all the observations which had beenm e as to the necessity of reducing to a minimum the use of steam in the navy. It was a source of get expen e, and might be the means of deterio. rating te eskill of our officers The subject had for some months engaged the attention of the Bord of Admiralty, and very stringent orders had been sent to the commanders on foreign stations, reqing them to limit the use of team to casesof necessity an emergency. (Hear, hear.) In addition to this all officers in oommand of vessels Wore required to state in their logs, not only every occasionin which steam was got up, but the reasons for Its use. As to the coaling in Plymouth harbour, and also in that of Portsmouth, nothing but the expense had prevented his asking tho Houseto snction some additional provision for that purpose. In Portland Poads some such provision had been made; but In the other cass hehad
en obligedto postpone til anotheryearasldag the House tovoteanJyroneyforthispurpo". Astothowagesofthe labourers in the dockyards he had to state that when the war began the artificers, such as ship. wrights, &c., were put upon task and job work instead of daywork. The result of this wms greatly to increase the amount of work which they performed and the efficiency of the yard. In order to enable the labourers to keep pace with the artificers and to remunerate them for their exta exertions, there was at the same time given to them a sum of money per week which was called " exertion money.
The reduction in the dockyards would be effected by reducing the artificers from task and job work to day. work which would take effect on the 31st of March; and then, as a result of that, the "exertion money " of the labourers vould ceasec The rat item [of the excems to which the hon. member for Ev am had alluded-vir., botween 500,0001. and 600,000. was almost entirely owing to the lae number of gunboats which the Government had thought itnecesBary to construct inthe previous year. He thought the Government wereruati. fied by the circumstances of the time in incurring this expenditure, and he threw himself with the greatest confidence on the judgment of the Hous.
Sir H. WILLOUGHBY had no doubt that this outlay wa very judicious, but it was the constitutional question it involved that demanded attention. A sm of 691,0001 having been expended as excess under one head alone, he contended that it ought to be brought consitutionally before the House for its sanction and authority.
In reply to Sir G. Pxcsr.,
SirC. WOOD aid, that steam vessels carrying a verysmall quantity of coals were not well adapted for the blockade service on the coast of Cuba. The squadron on the coast of Afica had been considerably strengthened, and there was nio reason to believe that it had not acted effectually as a check upon the shve trade.
The vote was then agreed to; as wa also a vote of 800,0001 for the wages of seamen and marines.

London, Tuesday, March 10, 1857.
I LONVDOR, TURSSDAY, MZARCH 10, 1S57.
In the House of Lordx last night,
The Earl of SHAiESDUiY, in movng a question to be referred to the consideration of the Judges, as to whether the revenue at present derived by the East India Company from the opium trade with China was in legal accordance with an Act passed in the 3d and 4th years of the reign of His late Mfjesty Wxmrx IV., said his first object was to asoertain whether or not the trade was one recognized by our laws, and then to proceed, with the assistance of their Lordships, to devise some means for its total abolition. He believed it was illegal not only as inconsistent with the spirit of our las, but in direct contravention to many of them. He had been taunted with having brought the subject before the notice of their Lordships in order to embarrass the Government and take advantage of the present state of feeling among parties with re-
rdto the affairs of China. But he denied that imputation on the honour of a gentleman. His simple object wvs to obtain an answer to his ques. tion. If the Judges declared the trade illegal, then it was for the Government to put an end to it at once and for ever. rf, on the contrary, they declared it legal he would then start from a new point, and appeal to the moral feelings of the people of this country to put an end to a traffie which had nothing to supporb it either in a commercial or a financial point of view. He then proceeded to recapitulate the provWions of the various Acts which bad been pamed from time to time regulating the Tndian trade, butnone of which, he contended, recognized the trade in opium, though, as their Lordships were aware, some of the latter entirely prohibited the East India Company from engaging in commercial transactions of any kind whatever. He begged, therefore, to press his motion upon the attention of their Lordships, and to entreat in its behalf the grave considerationwhich was demanded by the importance of the subject.
The LORD CHANrILoR submitted that Lord SHArFnmuweY's question was one which from its peculiar nature could not fairly be referred to the consideration of the Judges, who would in that case be called upon to try the whole Government of India unheard, and, if the trade was thought to be illegal, to condemn them and leave them open at a day's notice to the penalties of indictments for having systematically violated the lawsof therealm. It was impossible to ask the Government to take such a caurse, and that too, npon entirely ex pare statements. The quesilon as to the legality of the trade, however, might be subnutted privately for the opinion of the law officers of the Onowbo.
The Earl of SHArESBURY had no wish to expose any parties to the penalties of indictments, and he was willing to withdraw his motion, on the understanding that his question asto the legality of the traffic was so submitted to the Judges.
EarlGnsv thought that Lord SHAYMSBUrY had exercised a wise discretion in withdrawing his motion, though he attached no value to the opinion of the law officers of the CROwN based upon the legil technicalities of an Act of Parliament, as he believed the question of the legality of the traffic should be tried by far higher considerations. Ho believed no legal en-
.ctment would check the abuse of opium, as when once it went into the market it was imposible afterwards to regulate the proportions in which it should be used by pri-ate individuals. He had hoped that this motion would have included a question as to whether the Government had ever directly or indirectly connived at the praotice of smuggling opium into China, for that was the main point at i3sue. He then reviewed at length the present state of our relations with China, condemning in the strongest terms the conduct of the English Government, and referring to the objects with which it was intended to send out an envoy to Canton.
The Earl of ALsBrARxL begged to recall the attention of their lordships to the question before them. Much misapprehension existed in this country as to the smuggling of opitim. Legaliy in Chinam the trade in opium was prohibited, but practically it was free. To a certain extent the Chinese were dram-drinkers, though whenever they could got opium they preferred it. But if they had not the latter they would resort to the former, and there could be no doubt but that opium eating wras a mnuch muilder form of vioe than dramdrinking, and he believed that when not carried to excess it was less deleterious in its effects upon the humuan frame. He quoted varions medical and scientific authorities to show that the effect of opium when eaten or smoked in moderation was not so hurtful as it was generally reported to be. The destructive effects of ardent spirits they all knew, and knew that the records of their abuse filled half the criminal statistics of the United Kingdom. If the motion was premed to a division he should vote against it.
Earl GruANIviu, in replying to the remarks made by Earl GRYY, denied most distinctly that thee was any ground for supposing that the smuggling of opiun into China waa encouraged or connived at by the colonial authorities. It was the intention of the Government to de3patch an envoy to Canton 'In
order to place our relations with the Chineseemmpire on a satifctory basis, having, at the same We, due regard to the real interes of this Wingdom.
After a few remarks from the EArs of Mr.x?3U;y and SnAmuTsRy,
The Earl of ELLZNnoaoUGH said he feard.the raorlqu oretionof the traffic wouldbequitelost sIght of in solving the legal doubt. He, however, wouldrbe glad to leoan from the Loire OHACzLLonR what oonelusion had been como to with regard to the way in which the motion should be finally disposed of.
The LORD CHAzrIOR explained that the nobla earlr question would be submitted, though not by a vote of their Lordships' House, to the opinion of the judgos and law officers of the Onowx.
Thir replyled to a brie! conversation acto whether their Lordships' House would be in any way oomnitted or bound by the legal opinions, in which the Earl of DanY and the Duke oE AnmYLL took part. It was terminated by
Earl GurnVLr, who explained that the motion was withdrawn on the understanding that the qlsetior should be submitted to the opinion of tiL !MAjs's law officers. Their Lordsinps,l1owever wero not bound by that decision, whatoTer it mignt be.
The motion was then withdrawn, and their Lorddsips adjourned.
In the House of Commons several Bills were withdrawn.
Before the orders of the day were read,
The SrPzxxnR aid, after the statement made by Lord PAXIunusreo on Thursday, annoci an approching dimolution of Parliament, he Flt that it would be inconsistent with the respect due from him to the House if he did not announce his intention to retire from Parliament, and if he did not offer to the House his sincero and grateful acknowledgments for the uniform oDnfidence and support he had received not only from all parties, but-from every individua} member of the House.
Lord PALMERSTOx, addresing the SPrxx, said he was sure he was a faithful organ of the feelings of every member of the House when he assured him that it was with the deepest regret they had heard this announcement. He believed that no mans had ever sat in that chair who united ina eater dee al the qualities required in their Speakler, and their regret was minglld with feeling of the deepest gratitude, lie gave notice that this dayrhe sould move an expreusion of thanks on the part of the Hiouse to the Srxsxx.
The Commissioners of Supply (Scotlsnd) Act Aimendmnent Bill was read a third tine and passed.
The Report of the Committee of Ways and hIeans was brought np and agreed to.
On the orderfor the secondreading of the'lncometax Bill,
Mr. DmSE"AzL, with reference to the dispute with Persia observed that reasonable terma had been offerd at Constantinople, which had been rejected ; this rejection could not have cost the country less than 500,0001. ; and he wanted to know, if half a dozen of these difficulties occurred every year, costing upon an average 500,0001. each, how, under this turbulent aud aggressive system of diplomacy, the Income-tax even of Td. could be taken off I He did not feel justified in opposing the Bil, or any measure calculated to increase our resources, but he advised a more conciliatory foreign policy.
After a somewhat discursive debate, in which Mr. CoomucE, Mr. W. W uLsIANIS, SirR. WXLLOUOHBy, Mr. MTrz, and other members took part,
Lord PALNnRSTON vindicated the foreign policy of the Government from the charge of being turbutenf and aggressive, suggesting to Mr. DisRiur that the "turbulent and aggressive policy of HnA lAStTy's Government" would not be a successfiul electioncry for him and his friends.
Mr. GLADSTONE, considering that Lord PAL-nsrom had challenged the approbation of the House of the foreign policy of the Govermment, byway of protest briefly reviewed that policy as respected Persia, Naples (where, he thought, we had done either too much or too little), China, and America.
Mr. MILnis made some observations upon the Income-tax in the abstract, and upon otur interference in Neapolitan affairs.
Mr. V. SsITH defended the course taken by the Government in the Persian dispute.
Lord J. RUSSELL observed that the result of our proceedings at Naples had shown the inconvenience of the course which the Government had pursued; but he dissented from the proposal to resume our diplomatic relations with the King of the Two SiciLiES, who had shown no desire to change his mode of government. After some remarks upon the inexpediency of producing papers while negotiations were going on Lord Jons- suggested what he considered should be the principles by which our negotiations withChinaoughttoberegulated. Hothen proceeded to discuss the question as to the maritime rights of neutrals in time of war, and the proposition of the United States to exempt the ships and goods of private merchants and of belligerents from captore. If we were to agree to this proposition, he said, our being a great naval Power would be of no advantage to us; we should be exposed more frequently to war, and in war we should be almost helpless at sea.
After a few words from Mr. DFauNmoND, Mr. J. P1nmLrionE, and Sir C. NArIBB,
Mr. CoiaDZh said he totally differed from Lord J. RUSEL upon the subject of the Unlited States' proposition, and that at the proper moment he would offer arguments which, he thought, might change Lord Jom-'s opinion.
This desultory discussion was continued by Mr. NEWDEGATE, Mr. MiLNs, Mr. WnrTv;IDZ, and Sir F. KELLY.
The CHAucELLoua of the EXCHEQUER, in the course of a reply to objections regarding the Income-tax, stated that no answer had been made to the proposition of the United States, which was under the serious consideration of HER MAJESTY'S Governmeant, who would not come to a hasty conclusion upon the subject.
After some words from Lord H. VANn, the bill ws read a second time.
The House having resolved itself into a Committee of Supply on the Navy Estimates,
Sir C. WooD said, as he proposed to talke votes on account, he did not think it necessary to go at length into the different items; he gave, therefore, only one explanation, of the reasons why he had been unable to make a reduction of the number of men to the extent he had expected. He should move a vote for the number of men (38,700 seamen and 15,000 Marines) for four months only, and the money votes he should ask were one-third of the estimates, amounting in the aggregate to 2,700,0001.
The several votes were agreed to, after discussion. MIr. MAssEY obtained leave to bring in certain BiDs.
Mr. BouvERsE obtained leave to bring in a Bill to oontinue the Act for eharging the maintenanee of oertain paupers upon the union funds.
The ATrorNEY-GENERAL had leave to introduce a Bill to make fraudulent breaches of trust and duty b trustees, directors, and agents criminaly punishable.
After some further business, the House adjourned, at a quarter-past 10 o'clock.
"A moribund Parliament" is an expression for
" A moribund Parliament" is an expression for a mental as well as a chronological fact. Itineans a Parliament actuaUy in its death throes, feeble, agonized,wandering, delirious, anxious, oonsoienceumitten, and yielding all the more to high and supernatural impressions, inasmuch as they no longer conflict with the exigencies of the hour and the attractions of this outer world. Had thero not been a single word about the approaching dissolution, ono might havo known the days of Parliament were nurabered from the tone and topics, or rather the want of tone and the flying off from all topics, in the Commons last night. In the Lords the spectacle of s.yble philanthropist making a clean breast of hinbW was at least in keeping with the restlessness and flutter of the other House. Lord SHLAFTEsuuRY has no constituency to make his peace with, but has friends not less arbitrary and impracticable, whose highest ideal of life is a succession of unavailing protests. The Commons, however, were undisguisedty electioneering. How could they help it 7 No doubt, every one of them spvnt all Saturday and yesterday, not to speak of the intervening sday, ih casting about for the first idea of an address to his electors. At tlho very moderate computation of
ten watchwords, all stamped -with origina!ity, yet to find a free passage into the popular apprehension, there are no les than 6,000 varieties of this coinage now struggling f( r utterance. "No Reform," " War Taxes," " l3owRING 44 and Bloodshed," have already b-le daubed vith no friendly hand on the Ministerial banmer. Last night Mr. DIsRAELI could iiot allow the War Ninepence to be taken off without She remark that 'we should never get lid of the remaining sevenpence under "the tuibulent and 9' aggressive diplomacy" of Governwent; and no idoulbt half the " Conservative" addresses coming Dout this 'week will ring the changes oni that just -and simnple expression. For the mor- calculating clas of electors Mr. DIsRAXLI has himself provided a little sum they can do in their heads. What will six difficulties a-year, costing each ZOO,0001., come to in three years ? Lord PAL1tBnSTON having replied to the "turbulent and " aggressive policy," Mr. GLADsToNE regarded that *defence in the light of a general challenge, which he wccepted in all its generality. The result isthat we are mow in posisession of the principal figures of rhetoric which 'will be practised on the University of Oxford in the course of a month. The first of them is, " Excessive taxation and high expenditure," which Mill be highly appreciated by such country curates as stil keep their names on the books. / "A derogation from the rights and pri"vileg a of the House of Commons in 'with'holding the estimates for the Persian war" -h a view addressed to those who aspire to a knowledge of the British Constitution. " Too little or " too much" in the matter of Naples is condeseendingly borrowed from Lord JOBN RuSSELL, and is, at least, a safe criticism on every policy -which does not accomplish everything that might have been hoped for. For himself Mr. GLADSTONE -claims, as distinguished from other financiers, " a
sound, straightforward, and honest mode of "dealing with taxation and expenditure," and the -claim will, of course, be admitted by those who see in modesty the best guarantee for truth.
Lord JoHN RusssEL followed the lead in this -cross-country discussion, and went into Naples, China, and, among other topics, the proposition of -the Iuited States' Government for securing the -immunity of merchant ships and goods in time of ivar. Re made a very sensible speech, all ithe more sensible, perhaps, because he had apparently lost sight of the question before the Rouse, and was giving vent to the free -suggestions of his native good sense. Mr. 'COBDEN totally differed from his Lordship on -tho American question, and promises his reazons, whether in this or the next Parliament -will doubtless depend upon circumstances. Such -vere some of the topics woven into this very multifarious debate. Every night till the fatal 25th the circle -will widen, the range will become longer, freeer utterance will be given to spontaneous -convictions and desultory ideas, and al attempt at deliberative unity and continuity will be lost in the tatruggle of everybody and everything to be heard. 'The sooner the House is put out of its pain the better. It is responsible to the people ; that re-sponsibility, however, is not to be discharged by a few phrases falling from the lips in articulo mon-ie, but by a long course of action. For our part, therefore, we beg to suggest to the public not to rest on a few claptrap sentences, carefully -adapted to the taste of this or that class; nor yet -to wait for the dexterous appeals which it will shortly read in many a provincial column and on -many a borough walL We advise it to take a -wide and practical view of the conduct of parties and of statesmen; to consider what they have done, what they have not done; what they have obstructed, or attempted to obstruct; what -ar the results of their measures; what good the nation has got by them, and what it has got in spite of their endeavours to prevent it. All this is -ow a matter of history; it has not to be spoken -or written, and it cannot be unsaid or unwritten.
As for Lord SnAFTESBnU-RY'S attempt to deliver his soul from the national traffic in opium, if his lordship reaUy wishes for satisfaction on this point he need only listen to a few biunple facts and a little plain common sense. Opium is quite as lawful a thing, quite as beneficial, or rather medicinal, for -certain states of the body and for occasionaljpurposes, as any other sedative or stimulant. There is no .civilized, or semi-dvilized nation, and hardly a barbarous one, that does not use stimulants, regularly, abundantly, and so habitually that the habit becomes second nature. They either drink, or eat, or chew, or smoke, or snuff up something or other. For example, to take the most respectable -classes under the sun, the nobility, gentry, and -clergy of tlis country, they drink wines, spirits,
3malt liquors, tea and coffee; they smoke cigars and take snuff. There are very few of them that do not use one or more of these stimulants, sometimes to an excessive and injurious extent. That is -all the case with regard to the use; of opium,
itself so medicinal that eminent physicians have declared it to be the one drug they would keep if obliged to sacrifice all the rest of the pharmacoptaia. The East India Company, then, -Tnay undoubtedly produce such a drug, and make vhat terms it pleases with its tenants on its own soil for its cultivation, taxation, and sale. With the purchaser they have nothing to do, and, even if they had, it matters not if they know the purchase is made for one country rather than another. Opium is not mentioned -in the Chinese Treaty of 1842. In that Treaty
'we only engaged not to connive at smuggling, and it is no connivance to sell the drug to a man who comes with his vessel, his money, his proper papers and takes the cargo out of sight. It is for the 'Chinese to stop smugglng if they wish or can; but they do not reaUy 'wish it, or make the poorest -attempt. The cause of the evil is their own exclusive system, which prevents the introduction of European knowledge, habits, and commodities. 'The reaoons for that exclusion are of the most selfish and mercenary character. Were it given up, our traders would enter China and push their goods into the interior of that vast population. That would lead to the Chinese taking something else in -return for their tea besides silver and opium; and
'we have a right to demand such a course, if only because it is the only way to stop the opium traffic -and the smuggling which excite Lord SUAFrZsaBURX' virtuous indignation.

By the last steamer from America we learn that
By tho last steamer from America we learn that the new President, Mr. BUCHANAN, had appointed General L};is OASs, of Michigan, to be Seceretary -of State-that is, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Chief of the Cabinet. There wras a time wheu -such an act would have been received in England as a most serious demonstration. General OAsS is as well known to us by reputation as one of our own politicians. From a time beyond -the memory of most of us he has been in Eag-
isih eyes the representative of the great Western Democracy, with all its prejudices and animosities. 7he General is said to be 75 years old, and during Nhe term of his political life he has been a Minister at
lome, a representative in Europe, and for a nurmber of years senator from the State of Michigan. But whetber at a bureau in Washington, at a levee at the Tnileries, or amid the cleaings of his Western home, he has ever been the vehement denouncer of England, her ambition, her hatred of liberty, her designs to thwart the development and diaturb the peace of the United States. The lifo of General CASs has been nearry co4temp6raneous with the acknowledged independence of his country; he remembers America
thinly populated and a second-rate Power; the struggle of 1812 found him a young mau; the long war of abuse between Tory England and the touchy young Democracy of America is still fresh in his recollection; and, like many a man of strong feelings and deeply-rooted prejudices, he has carried the traditions of one age into another which has little in common with it. In the series of disputes regarding the Maine boundary, Oregon, and Texas, the voice of General CAss was ever violent, and his prophecies of inevitable war went near to cause their own fulfilment. At that tine there existed a kind of international soreness, which seems now to have passed away. Scarcely a copy of any Opposition paper inParis was published without a tirade against " perfidious Albion," and the American press was not behindhand in accusations and invectives. Ireland was mad with misery and sedition; Canada was just becoming tranquillized after a long fever of discontent. Consequently General CASs and his speeches excited no little curiosity. le was supposed to express the feelings of the majority of his countrymen, and to indicate the likelihood of a new alliance of France and America against the mother country. But those days have passed away. The British Empire has seen discontent and disorder vanish from its bounds. All important points of difference between England and the United States have been settled; the communications between the two nations have increased so wonderfully as to make them for all commercial purposes a single country; a better feeling has come into existence, founded on a clearer understanding of each other's circumstances and institutions. Our ovn relations with our nearest European neighbour are of the most cordial hind. The speeches of General CAss and his school have therefore lost most of their importance. We feel that much of such language is mere popular oratory, much of it the promptings of a reatless and suspicious temper. The warlike tone is, we believe, not one to which any large section of politicians in any country now responds, and those who still adopt it run the chance of being looked upon as crotchetty or antiquated.
Yet, as General CAss is known throughout the world for his Anglophobia, and known for little else, it may be thought that Mr. BucEANA, in selecting him for the highest office next to his own,
does not give hopes of an Administration friendly to this country. On this point we can hardly pronounce an opinion. It would certainly seem that the new President is desirous to inaugurate a very national and independent policy in respect to American affairs, or, at least, to have the credit of the intention. But there are, we believe, domestic reasons for the President's choice, with which foreign relations have nothing to do. Mr. BucuAiAN represents the double Democracy of the North and the South, and both these have to be conciliated. The South, which has for years openly preached the doctrines of nullification and separation, wished to force on the President a man representing its most extreme views, M. WAx;EB, in preference to his own choice, Mr. HowELi CoBs, a politician well spoken of for ability and moderation, but too conservative and too little disposed to espouse a restless and violent policy to meet the approval of the Southern disunionists. The President did not wish to give up Mr. CoBs, and was determined not to have Mr. WAincnn, but he was equally unwilling to commence his career by offending a large part of his supporters. He has therefore conferred the office on General CAsS, a man popular with the Democracy of both sections, but too experienced and too patriotic to give any encouragement to exclusively Southern views. Mr. COBB, we are told, is appointed Secretary to the Treasury, with the intention that he shaU succeed General CAss as Secretary of State. General CAss is of an age when the duties of office are likely to be felt as a hea-vy burden, and it is anticipated that when the Cabinet has been brought into working order,
and the demands of party gratified, he will leave his post for the retirement of private life. The internal policy to which tne President has given his adbesion by this double appointment is that which the late Dm&i=. W BBsTER established
by the measure of 1850. Both General CAss and Mr. COBB are stanch partisans of the slavery compromise of that year. They wiU sternly reprobate any tendency in the South to set up the standard of disunion, or to place their own interests above those of the whole Republic, while, on the other hand, they wi give no encouragement to the Abolitionists, and will oppose any attempt to limit the number of slave States. Thus Mr. BucHANAN hopes to satisfy the desires of his complex party, and gain for his Administration a popularity to which his predecessor could not attain.
Such is the explanation giveli by those who do not see, or do not wish to see, in the appointment of General CAss an act of hostility to this country. We believe there is much truth in it, simply because in the present state of our relations any attempt to kindle discord between the two nations would only damage its author. Mr. Buecmn?
is too experienced a politician, and too well acquainted with this country, to bring voluntarily on his own head trouble and difficulty by a gratuitous challenge. After all, M inisterial human nature is the same all over the world. We find at home that every Government is obliged to foUlow pretty much the same course of policy: the Conservative confesses that the time has come for change; the Radical, that circumstances do not admit of sweeping reform; and the result is a pretty even rate of progress, founded on compromise, and open to the charge of what is calUed inconsistency. So we suspect it wi be found at Washington. Mr. BucHs"AN willimit the application of the theory promulgated at Ostend, General CASS will discover that the British Government, with which he wil at one enter into correspondence, is not a mere grasping heartless despotism. At the age of To even the most fervid spirit is
somewhat disposed to tranquillity, and we cnn well imagine that after having made war speeches to two generations of his country. tbe new Secretary of State will settle down into a sufficiently peaceful and reasonable man of business.
Perhaps we shaU be suspected of wishing to make the best of a bad business, but we cannot
refrain from saying that in dealing with a Democratic eommunity like the United States it may, perhaps, be as well to treat through Ministers who have a reputation for a strong national and antiEnglish spirit. It is quite possible that men like Mr. BucnEiAw and General CAss can afford to be more conciliatory in action than others, simply
because in profemsion they have always been diitrustful and hostile. A President who bas his reputation for spirit to make may not unrnaturally shrink from concluding a treaty or joining in diplomatic action with this country, well knowing that he is likely to be represented in
hundreds of newspapers as having been intimidated or overreached. But a ma n who can point to his former speeches, and ask if it is likely that he would do an aet derogatory to his country's dignity may be able to conduct international business in a friendly spirit. Such, we trust, will be the case with Mr. Buc ArA - and his Lieutenant.
IThey will have it in their power to remove the only cause of difference between the two countries I by the ratification of the Central Anmeriea Treaty;
and we do not think that they will lose the opportunity. ,

The interests of society and the claims of the
The interests of society and the claimns of the press were brought once more under the conaidera-
tion of a court of justice on Friday.last in th6 now well-known case of "DvIsowr v. DuroAx
ancd ANOTHRB." We do not desire to enter into details which have attracted our notice olely on account of the public interests incidentally involved, but the leading facts of the case may be recapitulated in a very few words. The defendants were the publishers of the Durham Advertiser, in which journal there appeared a report of the proceedings at a certain meeting of the West Hartlepool Improvement Conmission. This report contained matter reflecting on the conduct of the plaintiff, who thereupon bronght an aotion for libel against the paper, and the question raised concerns the freedom of the prems in publishing fair, true, and correct reports of publieproceedings without responsibility for the statements which they may contain. It has been recently held that the press is not entitled to any such liberty, and that it is liable to account for any actionable matter contained in a speech reported, although such speech may have been publicly delivered, correctly and without malice taken down, and printed in the simple discharge of that duty which every reader of a newspaper expects to see performed. As far as regards the trial which appeared yesterday in our columns, the result was not unsatisfactory, for while, on the one hand, the imputations of which the plaintiff complained were disproved, on the other the jury awarded only a farthing damages on the first two issues, and found for the defendants on the, last and important plea, "being of opinion that the " report was correct, and published without " malice." To the several points, however, affecting the great principle at stake as they were brought out by the arguments t-e now very earnestly invite the attention of the publiec.
It was not denied for a moment that the meeting in question was -a public meeting, and such a meeting, in every sense, as caUed for the publication of its proceedings. The Clerk to the Commissioners deposed, that " their meetings were held "every other week, and for the last year and a "half had been attended by the reporters for the "public press, and the proceedings reported." It is also perfectly manifest that the passage on which the action was founded amounted simply to a report, and nothing beyond, being a plain matter-of-fact representation of words spoken and proceedings taken. It is trne that the plaintiff's counsel impeached the accuracy of the report in one particular point, but, as 31r. Justice CROsiProw very fairly remarked, "the report gave the " purport" of the matter, "and a newspaper does " not always profess to give every word " of a document." In short, it appeared from the evidence, beyond aU question, that the Durham Advertiser did truly per-. form the part of a public journal, and did nothing more. Now, on the face of such substantiation, we affirm that no liability on account of any matter contained in the report ought to attach to a paper, which is merely a vehicle of information, and the functions of which, in such capacity, are univesally recognized and turned to use.
Against such a view of the case -we have the learned Judge's observation in his charge to the jury, that " there is no obligation on the "press to publish matters of this kind, so as "to protect them in the way that a man is "protected in giving what he believes to be a "true character of a servant." As a declaration of the existing law, this coincides, no doubt, with what has been laid down elsewhere, nor do we desire to argue the legal point afresh; but we do affirm that, morally and in fact, this obligation has a real existence, and that, if a corresponding protection is not extended to those who act honestly under it to the best of their power, there is an end to the freedom of the press, and to all the public benefits which that freedom conveys. The free press of this country is a fact; that press discharges certain notorious functions, and among these one of the most notorious is that of reporting public proceedings. We say that we, and not we only, but al the journals of the kingdom, stand bound by the very terms of our existence to furnish our readers with such reports, and that if we failed to do so in any case of public interest or importance we should be justly held defaulters as regards a known obligation. We say further, and without fear of denial, that this system of reporting is confessedly to the advantage of the country. There is not a speaker at any meeting, whatever may be his politics, his objects, or his views, who does not wish that weight and effect may be given to his arguments through that publicity with which the prees provides them; and it is but common justice that in discharging such a function we should enjoy protection, so long as we dlischarge it honestly. " Publishers of news"papers," said Mr. Justice CROMPTON, " have "no more right than other people to prhnt "matter injurious to the character of others." Of course not; but when they print such matter not with the intent or purpose of injuring others-not as the authors or even the endorsers of the statement, but simply in the exercise of a known and a beneficial profession, and as repeating for the benefit of many what W2S designed for all, but could only be addressed to a few,-then, we say, they do possess more rightn than other people, and that such rights ought in justice to be embodied in law.
Asecond objection tothe%eviewa is alsoto befolnd in Mr. JusticeCnoprrToN's charge, whereheintimrates that, but for the existing state of the law, a suferer under the circulation given to a calnmny by a printed report might lose his opporH .nity of ,e dress. To this we reply that redre's sJ ul,' ce claimed at the hands of those -ho e;d ". w ,,g. We abstain from entering into the parti-ar case which happened to be tried, * t we affirm, as the plain and obvious dictate of reason and justice, that if the report of a speech carries injury to any one, the speaker, and not the reporter, should be accountable for it-exactly as in the case of a threatening letter the writer, and not the Postoffice, is chargeable with the offence. A public speaker addresses his audience with all the liabilities attending publication. He knows that he will be reported; he intends to be reported; if he were not reported he would think himself ill-
used, and he should be prepared therefore to take the consequences of the position he aesumes. We admit entirely that for wrong there should be remedy, but we say that this remedy should be sought from the wrongdoer hinmelf.
A -third argument agaiXit the freedom thus claimed for the press is occasionally brought forward,.. and seemed. to be indirectly alluded to in the speech of the plaintiff's counsel. It implies that there is some discrimination incumbent upon journalists-that they ought to report some speeches or parts of speeches or proceedings, and not others, and that, while professing to give an account of what actually took place, they should subject this account to certain modifications at their 'own proper discretion. We make bold to assert that this ground will not be found tenable for a moment. It stands to reason that a report, if it is to I
worth anything at all, should be a full report and a true one. If it were otherwise, no superatrseture could be raised upon it, as nobody coild tell whether some suppression or omissi,n Diight not change the import. of -what was left. In;2Iplain truth; it- is- -'tU An` ih tWAt inaeditor oauld apply such juidgmoet to Al he reports coming
before him, and, even if the nature of things did. admit it, who, we aak, would recommend or tolerate for one moment a system under which irn what Purported to be a full report of some public meeting any apeech might be omitted altogether or garbled at the publisher's discretion? We cannot affect to consider such a point as admitting of argument at alL Gross violations of public decency we csn, of course, exclude from our columns, but, with such rare exceptions, a report should necessarily reflect the proceedings in question with all the simplicity and truthfulness of a mirror.
And now we will state in plain language, and in half-a-dozen words, what is the real difficulty at the bottom of all this question. It is this:-
That those duties of the press which everybody recognizes in practice are not recognized in law. There is not a man who would not say that newspapers " ought" to report the proceedings of public meetings ; in fact, this very function follows in the shape of an absolate obligation upon the existence of a free press at all. When, however, the matter is brought to the test of law, the professional functions of a journalist are ignored, and the circulation which in the performance of a well-known duty he has mechanically given to an injurious speech is represented as making him the responsible author of the injury. It is true that he may be sometimes-we trust very often-protectea by the manly justice of such a jury as sat at Durham, but we look to Lord CAaIPBELU and the Committee of Lords for such an assimilation of law and reason as may give-us a final and comprehensive security.
That one half of the world is ignorant of how
that one half of the world is ignorant of how the other half lives is an old enough Saying, which would appear to be Singularly illustrated by the case of " Coor" v. La MxRT," which was tried on Saturday last before Mr. Justice WnI.ES at Oxford. In this proceeding were involved the son of an English nobleman, a quack doctor, an Irishman in an indescribable position, and a horse formerly the property of that respectable member of Society, WLiim PAraizR of Rugeley. The action was in the nature of an interpleader to try in whom lay the right of property in the horse, which was caled Gemma Di Vergy. We need not, however, trouble our readers with technicalities, as they have nothing to do with that with which we alone are concerned-namely, the picture of modem manners which is presented to us in this report. The two principals in tbe transaction were ths plaintiff COGL., a defaulter on the Turf, and JoiupH L.a MEBT, who is described as a quack doctor. The history of COoLAN appears to have been somewhat as followsv:-He began life as apprentice to a merchant at Dublin, but the tedium which attends the operations of legitimate commerce was not to his mind, for in the year 1835 he became affiliated to the Turf. We cannot suppose that during the first five years of his career in this speculative profession COoLAG very msterially improved his fortune, for in the year 1840 we find him engaged at the Wellington Arms, at Strathfieldsaye, in a serious game of " Blind Hookey" with a young gentleman named STRATZORD. From this deluded individual he won a sum of 10,0001., for which he obtained bills, which he endorsed away to another dape, from whom he received as value 4,0001. or 5,0001. in cash. The eudorsee sued the young champion of "Blind Hookey" on the bills, failed in the action, and lost his money. This transaction, as COGLAi said, proved to him a "great '"moral lesson." It is to be regretted that during the next six years materials fail us for an exact biography of Mr. COGL . In the year 1851 he became insolvent, but mcst unfortunately, as he said, "through a technical objection "-the man is an Irishman,-his petition was dismissed. He happened to be dowh at a steeplechase at Liverpool in the year 1855, and there he was arrested. When questioned by the Court he was unable to give any idea of the amount of his debts. They might reach the sum of 20,0001. ; or, agin, they might not-he was entirely uninformed-or perhaps, m%nas infter opes inops, he was too well informed upon the subject. He was a defaulter on the Turf; had he not so far back as the year 1850, as he informed the jury at Oxford with tears in his eyes, sustained heavy losses on that debatable ground ? Despite of this series of adventures in the year 1856, by some miracle of good luck or good management, he had a credit in the hands of his bankers, Messrs. HRRRM., FARQUHfAR, and Co., to the extent of 1,8001., and in that year paid 6501. as the price of the horse Gemma di Vergy to the Hon. Mr. LAWLEY. Mr. LAwLaY, as is sufficiently notorious, subsequently got into difficulties. The horse was seized, as his property, by the Sheriff of Berkshire under an execution, and the question before the Court was whether the sale from LAwixy to COGLAiy was a bond fid proceeding, or whether it was a mere pretended sale, set up in order to protect from wL.iY's creditors a horse which had so increased in value as to be estimated at 2,0001.? Mr. IAWL3Y's connexion with the case is somewhat more strange.
This gentleman, the son of Lord WaiiLocx, was compelled through untoward circumstances not long since to quit the country. Before the occurrence of this event, however, the Turf, like misery, hWd made the hon. gentleman acquainted with strange bedfellows. On Saturday last there was placed in the witness-box, as a person who had acted in the character of MIr. LAwxays confidential agent, a street-sweeper named HA.-irm. This exhilition will, we fear, prove a heavy blow to the " crossing interest." Mysterious tales have ever been rife as to the luxurious manner in whicha the ladies and gentlemen who devote themselves to this somewhat unpretending profession pass their hours of retirement. If we remember right, the tenant of the Bank crossing is generally supposed to have married a lady of great personal attractions and considerable fortune, and to have resided in a genteel villa residence in one of the more polite suburbs. Even the less fortunate members of the profession are said to meet at luxurious supper tables, and to laugh over their savoury rashers and Steaming punch at the credulity of the public. Elderly street-sweepers of the gentler sex have died upon mattresses stuffed with golden sovereigns. Their outward povertyhas been but as the ugly wall of the Alhambra, erected by the cautios Moor to disarm the NmEzsis of his creed, and conceal the internal splendour, which might provoke the envy of mankind. Mr. HaHrL., however; tho streetsweeper, the cenfidential ager* of ME. Lwagy, regardless of the traditions of his school, made ostentatious display of his weth. He carefully inspected the. cheek which was submitted to-his notice with. a gold eyegisse, for he had been caUed by the plaintiff to prove that the amount of one of; the checks had been paid to M1r. LAWLI.- It s a somewhat novel feature in London life to. find a street-sweeper engaged in Turf trauaaetiw, acting as confidential agent to a nobleam s son, and comrnug forward to give. his Gidensie in a court of justice with a gold eye* glass Time was when the betting-ring was filled with gentlemen of high character; but those days seem to have departed.

SOUTHA~WTOIY.
Both the sitting member for- this b s, Mr. G Villoox nd Mr. C. M. Weguelin, have suaed their addreses, offsring themselves for re-election when the a
proaching distolution takes plae. The first-named gentlemxn says he has been mainly induced t* come forward gain by the hope thati it may tend to the resoration of ha-rmony in the Liberal ranks, an strongly reeommends to the constituency his colleague, Mr. Wegaein, 1ho 8ince his eletion he hasfound "to be a sound iJberal, a man of ability, anda gentleman." IlEeepotig himself the hon. member says:
"Havin rcepented You in the House of enoeous for fys mTyMaharlnente2y conduct iabefeora yo; I concelve.z tesetrre, no pledge arenoWneessaryformetoMAke Iamcotentto stado, fall by your Opinion of it."
Mr. Weguelin, in his address, says
" An i-mediate appeal is to be made to the county in cOneqoenoe of an adve yotoe In the nouse of Common upon the subject ot the wr In Cina. As one ot your representatives In Parliament I supporte Lord P&Imerson's Govemment upon that qneetionbolierlin that tbo Gorernment wa not responible for the cemmenomment of that wr, sau did Its duty no bl and gonrously in retu,gnr to acfice tothe cry or facUon the public servants of this country in China witbonttfrtherinquiry and witbout Sn accrte knowledgo of tZe. trying clrcumlaftces under wb!hc they acted.

If you do me the honour of again cboosing me am your repeentative Pupoe affording the Gornmment an independent, but not an indiscriminate support."
After declaring himself in favour of extension of the franchise, the baUot, unsectarian education, law reform, abolition of church.rates, and other measures of political advancement, Mr. Weguelin observes:
It is a matter of inere eongratulatiou to mo that Ihaveacted in allmstten connecdA with your representation In pfect Xaco4 with your exoeDlint member Mr. Willoox. I tetthat the ties which nowrOlment us strengthened by mutual confidence and esteeommay b rattfied by our naltedreturz to Parliament ayour reeresen:atiTes,
Of this hope being roalized there is little or no doubt. The feeling in favour of a thorough reunion of the great Liberal party in this borough is so strong lr and so generally entertained that their United support Will oubtless be given to the two sitting members In that case any opposition from the Conservatives, whose only chance of success lies in division in the Libeira anks, and who could not return their candidate at the recent election, even whcn two powerful sections of the Liberal party were arraigned against each other, i! entirely out of the question. Messrs. Wolicox and Weguelin's re-election, unopposed, is therefore confidently anticipated.
GREAT YAR1OUTHI.
On Saturday Mr. W. T. MSCul1agh and Ifr. E. W. Watkln, the Liberal candidates for this borough, appeared before a public meeting at the Star Hotel. 1M. J. W. Shelley, one of the magistrates of the toWn, was called to the chair.
Mr. MrCULLAGH, who first addressed the meeting, said, he regretted that the issue which the country would have to try was so peculiar and exceptional. He shouId have preferred that the country should have been caUed upon to choose a new Parliament upon some broader snd more general basis than that of confidence in aparticular lnis+er upon a Paticular question; but he did not despair of things dv ncing a little, and he thought that, as the opinion of the public was thoroughly developed, both parties would be seen in * different attitude from that in which they had been for the last few days. It would be for the interest ot both parties that this should be the caso, because, however pressing the present exigency nmght be, it would pass wawy, and an interest wouid be felt in other great questions. For his own part, he would give no pledge that he would support any Minister; he wouid be the ervant of his constituents, but he would not vote in mute and doltish obedience to them, nor would he pledge himself to be the servant of any other man because it was impossible to say what was before them. Situated, however, as the Liberal partr was at present-rent, as he was sorry to say it was, by divisions neither new nor few-they ought to learn something from experience, and for the oommon interests and for the sake of common progress give lp someting of their own individual opinions in a conciliatory spirit. Ii stating his political sentiments, Mr. 3rCollagh expressed himself against a wasteful public expenditure, alt ough he at the same time considered it necessary to establish an efficient system of defences, as England's greatness rendered her a constant object of envy to the despotic Governmentg of the continent. He also stated that every day deepened his convictiou that the country was too much centralized, and that the localism of England was the life of England. Mr. 1I'Culah also declared himself in favour of an extension of the saf-age, and of affording some legislative protection to the poor voter In the exercise of the franchiEe.
Mr. WATERT expressed his intention, if returned, to support an extension of the saffrage, vote by ballot, and educational and other raform.
On the motion of Mr. J. CLOWB, seconded by Mr. T. LETTIS, Mr. PCollagh and Mr. Watkin were formally recognised as the candidates of the Liberal party in the borough.
B,RMURY.-Mr. H. W. Tancred, sLP. or this borough for many years, has issued an address to the electors in Which he remarks:-
"I returnito your handatbegretttrust hlchyou have upo. ix diferent occasious committed to me. and solicit to be again picdin he position of being your repreientatlve in Parnament. I mention the lengthened D enod of my serrice, bcause during that tlme my PrDindpls rmugt have bean zacert.lned by my conduec Iam unchanged, and prepared to give my independent gupocrt to any Gors,nme,t tbst wil upholdthe trueinterest of thopeople. I cn only promito purBsu the Same course of public action which hu hitherto secured me the inestimable adrantage of your oontinued favour."
Other gentlemen, it is said, intend offering themselves to represent this borough. Mr. Tancred's last vote, in favour of Government, on Mr. Cohden's resolutions, gave general satisfaction.
CtE TBXLHM.-A very strong feeling has been created in this town by the defeat of the Ministry on the China question, and a determination is expre among men of all shades of olitics to uphold the Plremier in the course he has adPtd -of appealing to the country. The name of our own representative, Captain Berkeley, appears in the minority, and the gallant Captain's vote on this occasion Will, it is thought, secure his re-election by a triumphant majority. On Saturday afternIoon a fewt inibseatial gentlemen (including several military een of Censervative politics) issued handbills writh an address of confidenee in Lord Pal. merston and his foreign policy, it being felt that in the present*a3pect of affairs the noble Lord is "the right man in the right place."
Du,gxR.-Mr. George VDncan, the m.ember for Dundee, in a letter to the town-councilof that borough, says it iS not his intention to ask a renewal of tho trust reposed in him for so many years by his fellow-townsmenf Mr. A. M. Dunlop, in a letter to Mr. Hunter, Provost o. Greenoc}r, in which he defends the recent vote against Ministers, intimates that he will not present himself for re-election.
HALiPAX-Yesterday, at a meeting of the united Liberal party held attho Old Cock Hotel, Ealif6x, it was unanimosl0yresolvedtosupport the present representatives of the borongh the Right Hon. Sir Charles Wood and lMr. I? kCrosse, at the coming election. A requisition to Major Edwards the defeated Conservative candidate at the last election, is in courseof signatur; butit is not expected that he will come forward, as his supporters are not suffi. ciently numerous to insure his returrn.
HAMiiL rJ.-There has been some talk of opposition to Lord Henry Cholmondeley for the southern division, of the county, but his Lordship's recent votes in support of the Govornment are presumed to, have strengthened his posi-
tion, and the noble Lord will most probably resme his. duties in the new Parliament. In thozorthern divisiox Mr. Beach of Oakley-hal, near Basingstoko, is narmed as a candidate, should MIr. Shaw Leifev vacate the Speakershp, and go to the Upper House.
LAICCASntz (NORTJ¶),-mr. Heyvood retiras, but Colonel Pasten will again.come forward for this ulkision-of LAncashire. It is rumoure& that Lord Stanley will be invted to ofr himself for the vacancy.
L12COr1rSRMX.-For the northern division of bhe county our present members are the Rist Bon. Robeb A. C. . HIamilton, and Mr. JalmeBaaiStanhope. Mr. . Hamilton baa. announced his inteistijes, ot retiring. aad it is believed that he will be re d for one o the Seote0

porter by the retrn of Sb Xotcague John Cholmeley, of

Henea It ha betn said that Vissctt Godrich -would contest the city, but he has declined to do so-ans also has Maj%r Weston Ameotts, of ac Mhorne .

Dot unlirely thah h, will again contest Newport. At

Menego,the roter f th meberfor Linoln. For F amfr 8 ir F , Thesiger and Lord B obert T. G. Ceoil will bo returne&'isnoppoeod.

Norwrr-3Smarn (NORTn -In many districb of this division there is a strong feeling in favour of irddP&l.- merston, and towards the coalition which caused ~Is recent defeat there is a marked dislike.

?AXJ, SUyDAY, MAIU 8, 6 P.X.
The sensation produced in every political cirole in this city by the defeat of Lord Palmerston has not yet subsided. All manifested their surprise, and for a time their incredulity, and some tleir joy. The most painful part of the affair was &he satisfaction of those who dislike England for her liberal institutions or her power still more even than they hate Ierd Palmerston. They pointed to the division of Wednesday night as a proof that, even in the classicland of Parliamentary gverrnent, a spirit of faction may prevail, as in other countries, and they scoffingly reminded us of our proud boast that there, at an ovents, by the representatives of a free people, when the honour and nights of Great Jritain are at stake, mere personal considerations are flung aside, men forget their dissensions, and in tho hour of peril sacrifice their political hatreds and their ambition on the common altar of their country. The division of Wednesday has, they say, proclaimed the hollowness of that boast, for the very "atoms" shose "fortuitous concourse" produced that check could not but be aware of the embarrassment that would follow, not merely to those who forme& the Government, but to the interest of the country at large. The organs of the press, I can hardly say of public opinion, expressed their exultation or their regret in characteristic fashion. The Journal des Dlbats almost forgot its habitual caution and the placidity of its dislikes, and expressed with unwonted energy its satisfaction at the event. The Assemb1e Naile, on whom the very names of Lord Palmerston and of England pres like a nightmare, uttered a yell of delight, and seemed to anticipate with joy the decay of a Power that has recogmzed the present Government of France, that has dared to censure the stupid cruelty of the Royal bigot of Naples, that has presumed to arrest the career of aggresaion of Russia, and that will lot take steps to plant the fusionedEoulrhons on the French throne, and will not join in a second Holy Alliance against revolutionists all over the world. The Ministerial journals were more reserved, and speculated rather on the consequences of the dissolution of Parliament than indulged in hostility to the Premier. It is said, I trust without foundation, that some satisfaction was manifested in high quarters, but of that felt by the Russian section of the Court retainers, and by those whose ambition depends on a Russian aUiance, there is little doubt. The Patrie, under its new direction, strongly advocates the prosecution of the war, and predicts that, whatever be the shortcomings of Sir John Bowring, they wiU all be forgotten in the glory of success. The Univers and the Silde, certainly from different motives, uphold the policy of EnglandtowardsChina; and the lattereulogizes ord Palmerston, whose triumph it anticipates when he makes an appeal from party animosities " to the electors of free England." Lord Derby, Mr. Dlsraeli, and Mr. Gladstone may rejoice, if it indeed be a cause of congratulation and of pride that they are admired and applauded by some who have never concealed their hatred of England and Englishmen.
A private letter from St. Petersburg speaks of the little chance of Paris enjoying for some time to come the advantage of M. de Moray's presence. The letter emanates from a Russian source, and the writer speaks of his Excellency having grown more Russian even than the subjects of the Autocrat himself - and it hints at the likelihood of that eminent diplomatist becoming a naturalized Russian, and fixing his abode, once for al, on the banks of the Neva. This is, perhaps, going a little too far; but it is certain that rumours, well or il-founded, have recently circulated in certain Parisian salons touching purchases of estates in Russia, not in the name, but, it is suspected, for the account of M. de Moray Circumstauces to which I have not hitherto alluded, in consequence of their purely personal character, though theyhave been discussedwithas little restraint as any fact of public notoriety, would, it is said, render his presence here just now, and for some time to come, rather inconvenient and unpleasant The Emperor happily makes the public good square 'with private convenience, and considerately keeps M. de Morny at his post as representative of the chivalrous French nation. The rumours of the purchases are, however, said to have reached the Imperial ear, and not tohaveproducedthe bestimpression. People at Court look at each other, and ask whether these acquiisitions (if acquisitions there be) are in anticipation of further chauves, or more unpleasant contin gencies, or do they indicate an incipient scepticism in the stability of the French Empire ? The letter I allude to further states that I!. de Morny continues to give assurances of his unceasing efforts in favour of an alliance between France and Russia; there are still difficulties in the way, but he hopes to overcome them all. Notwithstanding so many reasons for the contrary I stiU doubt whether M. de Moray expresses the real wishes of the Emperor in this respect, and I also doubt whether he enjoys his unlimited confidence so much as he and others suppose.
If I am to credit what I hear in one or two quarters, we are pretty certain to have French cooperation in our proceedings in Ohina. A convention is spoken of as likely to be concluded, after some negotiation between the two Governments, with the view of acting together and enforcing the execution of existing treaties. The French Government would naturaly wish to introduce a cause with reference to the Catholic missionaries. It is probable that a French Envoy, furnished with fresh instructions, will leave for China at the same time as the Envoy from England. A propos of the Chincse, and their reputation for humanity and gentleness of character, I find in the Moniteur de la FloUe the following proclamation from the Mandarin Governor of w halnpoa:-~
" Infamous foreigners have presumed to raise the standard of revolt against the sublime and venorated authority of the Emperor. They have attacked the city of Canton in order to burn it, and already have they received the punishment they merited, for our invincible troops have repulsed them, and killed a great number of them. Let them be attacked from every part of the empire. Let every inhabitant of China who shall meet an Englishman inflict on him the fate ho merits. Already do our innumorable fleets and our
iighty armies, which are dreaded by the whole world, ad. vance to drive them away. Lot everybody unite with that army-le' every one take part in the war, and teach foreigners to tremble before the will and before the anger of our Sovereign, whose gaze is as burning as the rays of the sun, and whose power is immeasurable.
"1 He who shall not act in conformity with these orders shall be considered as a traitor, and may expect from us a chastisement as prompt as terrible.
"You hear! Obey.
" The Mandarin Governor, TCHYN-TOO. "Done at Whampoa, the 9th day of the 12th Moon."
The Mtniteu,r de la Flote adds that on the publication of the preceding document, which is one of the least viotlent published by the Chinese authorities, the foreign ships anchored in the roads or in the Tchou-Kiang sailed away, taking with them the few Europeans in the town. The utmnost excitement prevailed.

cosequence of the difficulties attending the question befdore it a speial ominilon ishotWfbe named to prepare a definitive project for a tax oh2 personal property, of which the basis should be an impost on the profits of all joint-stock companies. The design of a duty on the tranifer of shAres. has been abandoned, as also the proposed measure of preventing all Bourse operations by cou2issiers or out-door stockbrokers. In the course of the discussion on these pointg several memberg of the Council gave proof of much talent, and, stll Inore strange, of some independence. Among these exceptional characters M. do Parrieu andM. de Vutry are montioned. The War Estimates were also discussed at the same sitting, and the Council succeeded in introducing a saving of 10,000,000f. in addition to the reductions previously effected in the same department.
There are symptoms of a strong opposition in the Senate on the Malakhoff pension. The objections, as I stated on a former occasion, are not to the grant of money, which amounts to 100,000f., bat to its transmission to the male descendants. This transmission is looked upon by the Senate as the establishment of a majorat2 and consequently as an infraction of the Constitution, which recognizes the equality of citizens before the law. It is very doubtful whether the Senate wil eventually throw out the bill, but, as it did on some former occasions show some little animation, much a result is not impossible. As to the grant itself to the Duke de
Uainkhoff (Marshal Pelisier), the Senators are unanimous.
The Police-court of Paris gave judgment yesterday in the case of the Directors of the Company of the Docks Napoleon! and M.

MARSE=LLES, MARCH 7.
A wealthy Greek shipowner lias been tried before the Police-court of this city on a charge of swindling. It appears that some short time since the accused insured one of his ships called the Trois Sceurs, said to be on her way from Scala Nova to Marseilles, for a sum of 230,000f. A few days subsequently it was announced that the Trois Sceurs had gone ashore at Tchesm6. The underwriters having conceived some supicion made further inquiries, and discovered that the owner had received a telegraphic despatch previous to his having effected the insurance announcing the loss of the Trois Scoeurs. The Court sentenced the accused to imprisonment for three years and a fine of 3,000f., and interdiction from civil rights for 10 years.
ITALY.
(FRO?I OUR OWN COBRR ONDETT.)
TURIN, MARCH 5.
The notes of Counts Buol and Cavour have been eagerlyrepublished and criticized by the Piedmon. tese papers. It was reported here last night that a reply had been received by the Minister for Foreign A ffairs from Vienna, but this is not the case, and I have reason to believe that when the Marquis Cantono read Count Cavour's despatch to Count Buol he said he would give an answerwhen the Emperor returned to Vienna. Of the criticis of the press here on the note of Count Buol it is unnecessary to remark, as they are in general only an echo of what has been already said by the journals of other countries, which are naturally less liable to the suspicion of pique or prejudice than those of Piedmont, and even those on Count Cavour's answer are much more moderate than might have been expected from the disappointed tone of private conversation. Nevertheless, the Sardinian Minister does not escape scathless even from those papers which are habitually his firmest supporters. All agree in thinking that had he written less he might have written better and the moderate and Radical journals are tolerabiy agreed as to what they find objectionable.
The Opini,ne which is the organ of the Ministerial majority in the Chambers, asks, what need was tkere for giving explanations regarding the sentence on journals that attack foreign princes? It says:-
"The law is there, but its application belongs to the Tribunals, which are independent of the Government and are inaffected by politics. We do not comprehend either why the note should strive to weaken the influence of the journals in the interior, an influence which is incontestable, and to which even the Ministers must bend whether they Will or not. The passage regarding the monuaent offered to the Municipality of Turin requires explanation to those who have the right to demand it, and it would be desirable that it should not over-abound in promises. With the exceptior of these criticismns which we give as the echo of publio opinion, the Government is praised for having nobly attested its faith in our free institutions."
The Diritto, a Radical paper, laments that Count Cavour should have thought it necessary at the commencement of his note to make the uncalled-for and unfounded confession of the excesses of the Piedmontese press. It says -
" We have no need to render account to the Austrian Government, and still less aro we obliged to deplore to it our faults. Count Cavour may speak according to his convictions on his own account, but he should not speak so on account of the nation as the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Neither is it prettier or more becoming to quote the comparison of the Belgian and English journals. If the repartee given to Austria is clever in reference to the renewedfidend. ship, it is not well to mix with it excuses that others have done worse in his opinion. We may pass over the case of the English, who have nothing to do but to laugh at it; but the Belgians,-what will they think of our Government r"
The Gazzetta del Popolo, another Radical paper, thinks the phraseology diffuse and excessively dipfomatic in both notes, but, seeing that the object of Austria was to represent the Sardinian Government as the accomplice of agitators, and thereby discredit it, the Gaz=etta del Popolo acknowledges that the aim of Count Cavour's answer was directed to Paris and London and St. Petersburg, and therefore it was little energetic, and gave useless particulars on the journalism here.
The Armenia, as the representative of the clerical party, expresses itself satisfied that Count Cavour nas declared himself in unison with the Austrian Minister on the desirableness of preserving peace, and, finding that Count Cavour has promised three things in the name of his Government,-viz., 1st, that if any journal offend Austria, and that Power will have the goodness to make a complaint of it, the jourual shall be immediately prosecuted, and punished by the tribunals; 2d, that this punishment shall not be a simple ceremony, like that inflicted on the Espero, but solemn, severe, and proportionate to the offence; 3d, that the monument to be erected in a " place of Turin, and accepted by the Municipality,' shall not have anything offensive either to Austia or the Austrian army,the Armwnia thinks the Austrian Government onght to be satisfied also. I wil conclude these quotations with a few words from the Cattolico of Genoa on the note. I have no need to doscribe the poitics of this paper, as its own expressions render any classification of that kdnd perfectly unne. cemary-
" Count Cavour writes a verylong note," says the Cato. 1ico, "1 which we will insert impartially, but he may writs volumnes -without bing able to exonerate tho Ministry ovor which he presides from the accusation of having excit, fomaested, and paid, the most sarilegious exceses of th prek,onlyooindAus but against everything thuis

The temporary suspetison of the official organ of' the great apostle of Italian Republicanism deprives us of the satisfaction of learning his opinions or those ol his friends on this affair. But this silence cannot last long. The Italia e Popo, it id announced, will reappear in a day or two, and M. Mazzini Will, no doubt, take an early opportunity of explaining to his followers how they are to think on the matter on the tapis. Whether there in but one indivisible spirit between the ItaZia e Po1polo and the Italia del Popolo (which sprang 'into life immediately on the decease of its dster),
and that the resuscitation of the one must I entail the death of the other, or whether they are two distinct creations, each having an existence separate from the other, is a mystery which can only be solved on the resurrection now so anxiously looked for by the Mazzinian sect.
On the whole, Count Cavour's note has not pleased here, for the reasons adduced in the papers above quoted; but public opinion privately, expressed is far stronger on the saubject than that printed. It will, however, be more apprectkted abroad than at home, perhaps; and indeed it is understood to have been very much approved by the Cabinets of London and Paris, by whom the remonstrances of Count Buol were thought to betray an inconvenient and uncalled-for amount of susceptibility.
SPAIN.
(nRoN oUR owN OORR;s?oxD,A r.)
_ADRI1), MAIRO 3.
The Queen is said to have lately taken opportunities of assuring various persons (among others Senor Rios Rosas, who returned last week to Madrid) of her determination to govern constitutionally. Unfortunately no weight can be attached to such assurances, proceding from that quarter. The conviction of this was never more general, and Royalty is just now in very bad odour in the once loyal capital of Spain. As of old, innumerable scandalous stories are circulated concerning the private life of the Court, but toihe little attention is paid, the subject having become stale. In Espartero's time the popularity of hi, Government was in some degree reflected on the Palace; when the Queen went abroad she was respectfully received and even cheered. Now it is rare indeed that a hand or hat moves on her appearance. When she goes to the
theatre the performance is no longer suspended A that the Royal March may be played upon her entrance, the orchestra having been once or twice checked when commencing it by the disapprobation and hissing of the audience. And it is quite startling to hear the cool and confident manner in -which her abdication or depositioxi is spokenr of, as an event that must come to pan, and which is only a question of time. The fruit is ripe, people say, and although it still hangs in apparent security on the itree, any day may witness its falL This might be produced by a single act of imprudence. Had the much talked of journey to the south taken place, many believe that the Queen would never have returned to Madrid. They think that the coup d'Ztat would have been attempted, would have failed, and that she Wrould have embarked at Valencia, or some other pwrt. Such is the contempt and odium into which the present dynasty has fallen that, if its regniig representative onceeleft Spain, there would be little chance of her recall. Foreign interference or militry force, might ag,ain place her on the throne,' but the national voice would assuredly never be raised either to invite or to welcome her back to the country that has suffered so much for her sake and under her reign. This state of public feeling is to be attributed mainly to the profound and general conviction of the insinerity and perfidy of all that proceeds from the Palace, and of the ntter incompatibility of the order of things now existim' there with any good and settied Government. "here is scarcely a statesman of mark in Spain who has held office for any 'time' who has not had reason to complain of Royal dissimulation and treachery; who has not had Ihis plans thwarted, and his honour, and perhaps his safety, jeopardized, by thte manceuvres of Royal camarillas. The system is not new; einamples of it have been continual; from Olozaga to Espartero and O'Donnell how many might there not be enumerated ! By this unworthy course Royalty has alieuated its best friends and steadiest supporters, converting some of them into downright enemies, others into indifferent wad contemptuous observers of the course of events; who wvould not stir hand or foot to save the throne 6t Queen Isabella if to-morrowv it tottered. In s,hort, thingsZ have comne to such a pass that the question in moat people's, minds seems to be, not wvhether the present Sovereign is to be retained, but wihat is to be, put in her place. Could a satisfactory answer be given to this last inquiry, it would probably soon appear that with respect to the previous one men's minds are fully made up.
'or some days past the offiial Gaze has contained nothing of the slightest interest, and the papers have been entirely barren of news. There is talk of sending an expedition to St. Domingo to
xact satisfaction for the recent outrag,e on the Spanish Consul there. Rather le6s confidence seems to be felt with respect to the anticipated result of the Mexican expedition. If the President declines the responsibility of Alvarez's barbarities, and bids Spain go and punish him as she pleases, the expediton wiU be in what Is commonly caled a fix. Neither 10,000 nor 60,000 men could follow up that savage chief into his strongholdinthe tierra caliesite wiith any chance of success. The expense of the expedition would be great, and the results probably dsastroups.
Senor Mon is expected to leave for Rome towards the end of this week. Senor Isturitz still staves off his journey to St. Petersburg. It is thought probable he will be President of the Senate, General O'Donnell being resollute in refusing that post, as well as every other that would bring him into association with Narvaez, for whom he seems to cherish, at least in his political capacity, an intense antipathy. It is said to be in contemplation to purchase an hotel at Paris for the Spanish Embassy. The present house, in the Rue de Courcelles, is only rented, and is considered too smalL With a fine hotel, and an increase of the Ambassador's salary to 40,000 dollars a-year (some reports say even more), the representation of Spain at the Court of the Tuileries would be a snug retreat for Don Ramon Narvaez, who is said to look forward to it. Unfortunately, in Spain there is no security for the Minister who makes these calculations. He gives up his premiership with the understanding that his successor shall maintain him in the chosen embassy, and has scarcely reached his post when his recall arrives. Marshal Narvaez can hardly have forgotten one or two cases of this kind, and well-founded apprehensions of the Zm talionis will doubtless make him cautious.

The firm of Messrs. Dodge, Bacon and Co., merchants, and patentees of indiarabber cloth, have suspended in consequence of the non-receipt of remittahces expected to-day by the American mail.

The house have an establishment in America, t Newark, New Jersey.
The I,7d4endanCe Bedge of yesterday publishes the details of the intendedconstitution of the new International Bank at Paris. It is to be called the International Society of Commercial Credit, and the founders are Mr. Willian Gladstone, Mr. Weguelin, Governor of the Bank of England; and Mr. Charles Bell, all of the house of Thomson, Bonar, and Co., of London and St. Petersburg; Mr. Alderman Salomons, Mr. Charles Mforrison, of the firn of Morrison Dillon, and Co.; Mr. Arthur ELankey, Mr. S. H. J. Goldschmidt, and Mr. Ptobert Campbell; the Discount Society of Berlin, through its g&rant, M. David Haunsman, formerly Prussian Finance Minister; the Northern Bank of Germany, at Hamburg, represented by Senator Goddefroy and Ernest Merck, Consul-General - the Lpeipsic Credit Bank, represented byM.Albertbdufour Feronce; and finaUy, Messrs. L. R. Bischoffsheim, banker, and Armand Donon, of the firm of Donon, Aubry, Gautier, andCo., bankers, both of Paris. The Company are to discount commercial paper, to issue letters of credit, to make advances on public funds or on shares or obligations of railways and other industrial undertakings, to receive deposit accounts to be paid against checks and at interest or otherwise, according to the plan of the English banks; to participate in the issue of national loans, and to subscribe thereto with the express authority of the Government; to receive the cestody of securities of all descriptions; to make loans and advances on warrants and bills of lading and to transact every kind of ordinary banking operations. They are also to be empowered to establish agencies or branches abroad to carry on the same business, and to make advances on French securities, or to paythedividends on them. They may likewise, with the authority of the Government, establish branches in France. The capital is to be 4,800,0001., in shares of 2001. each, of which only half are to be issued in the first instance. One-third of the amount is to be subscribed in London, one-third in Germany, Belgium, and Holland, and one-third in France. 401. per share is to be paid on subscribing, and 401. within a month after the date of decree of authori7ation. The remaining 1201. will be called up at the discretion of the directors, but not until after the issue of the entire capital. The Board of Directors is to consist of 25 members, to be chosen by the shareholders at a general meeting, and they are annually to nominate a president, subject to the approval of the Government. The shares of the Company will be to bearer. According to the Inrkpenda7we BeZge the projected arrangements have experienced some check during the past few days, owing to the desire of the French Government to introduce a stronger French element, and several names had been reported as about to be added to the list, among which was that of M. Vandal, Administrator of the Direct Taxes.
The advices from Hamburg state that the rate of discount has risen to 5 per cent.
The commercial letters from New York to-day report a continued tendency to reaction in the stock-market, although some descriptions had improved. Erie Railway was quoted 56i to 57; Reading, 80 to i; New York Central, 89; and Illinois Central, 134* to 135. The effect of the violent article in the Union the organ of the Government at Washington, on the Central American question had been mitigated by a statement that it had been prompted by some of the discontented members of the outgoing Cabinet, and that the journal in question, although lately purchased by Mr. Appleton, who intended it to be the organ of Mr. Buchanan, had not yet passed into its new bands. The particulars of the new Mexican treaty had not yet been received, and its details were looked for with interest, as it had been negotiated without special instructions. Although the present packet has brought no gold remittances were expected to be shortly resumed, and in some quarters there was an impression that, owing to the extent of the recent importations of European goods, they will be unusually heavy.
The trade reports from the manufacturing towns for the past week present no new features. At Manchester there has been a fair extent of business, the demand for India having improved since the arrival of the last mail. The Birmingham advices describe steadiness in the iron-market, although the American orders have not been so large as was anticipated. At Nottingham the lace-market has been very active, the previous animation having been further stimulated by a demand from India, while for hosiery the home purchases have been on a good scale. But for the prospect of trade being affected by the general election there would, it is said, be no doubt that as regards the manufactures of that town the present would prove one of the most prosperous years ever known. In the woollen districts and the Irish linen-markets there has been no alteration.
A meeting of the creditors of Messrs. Swayne and Bovill, merchants and engineers, who failed on the 3d inst., was held to-day, when it was agreed to wind up the estate under inspection, the following gentlemen being selected to superintend the process:-Mr. Lockett, Mr. J. Cary, Mr. Rix, Mr. T. Freestiaa, and Mr. F. Bramwell. The whole of the discussion was in relation to the prospects of dividend,andthemeasuresto be adopted for completing the works in progress, since the results of these, to-
getner wth the proceeds of various patents, 'will greatly assist to increase the total assets. The annexed figures represent the principal items in the approximate statement submitted by Mr. Turquand, the accountant:

At a meeting to-day of the British Colonial Bank and Loan Company the report of thdirectors was unanimously adOpted. It Wa stated that close at-

" Following up the statement made at the annual meR. ing in March lait, the directors desire to remind the share. holders that in addition to the return of the wholo of the original capital, and thepayment of 6L per shire out of the ,nrplus funds of the compan, they wero enabled, in NSovember last, to distribute a lurther sum of 21 10,s. per share. Though these disbursements havo not wholly exhausted the funds in their custody, the directors aro of pinien, that, in accoding to the urgent instances of tho shareholders for the payment of the last instalment, they have for the present reached the verge of prudence. Tho result of the sale of the remaining properties of the oompany, and the proect of contingent liabilities, will of courso guide any further recommendations on this head. A small portion of the properties in question has been advantageously sold by auction; but the residue, consisting urn. cnar af storesinSydney nd Port acqanes andland ne'ar Uia ahd Port , were wit drawn, no reasanable offer having been mado for themL"
In the general business of the port of j London during the past week there has been little change. The number of ships reported inward was 122, beigr 22 less than in the previous week. These included 31 with cargoea of grain, &c., 7 with cargoes of sugar, 5 with cargoes of dried fruit, and 2 with cargoes of tea; thelatterincluding31,170 pack-aes, 21,399 of which were brought by the Earl of Eghi
ton, 12,545 of her cargo being chests. The number of ships cleared outward was U7, including 12 in ballast, showing a decrease of 14.
The departures from the port of London for the Australian colonies during the past week have com. prised four veFsels to Sydney and ono to Hobart Tovn., with au aggregate capacity of 3,656 tons. The rates of freight continue to exhibit heaviness.
The last papers from Sydney call attention to a matter of great impottaneo to English underwriters. It is stated to bo a frequent practice on the part of some consignees to get perfectly sound goods oondemned as " damaged by sea water." Honest im. porters are, of course, unable to compete with these fr=audulent persons, and a number of respectable Sydney firms have appealed by an advertisement in the Sydney fferaldto theLondon insurers to appoint some perwn in the oolony to protet their interests.
Some swindlers, pretending to b a a mercantile firm, have been engaged lately in Scotland, Ireland, and other parts in endeavoring to obtain goods by giving reference to various banks as to their respectability. Of course, upon reference being made, the imposition is detected; but such is occasionally the want of caution among tradesmen, that in som cases the goods have been furnished before the receipt of the answer to the inquiry.
The Primula has arrived from Sydney, but h not believed to have brought any gold.
The Nelous has arrived from Foo-chow-Foo with 3047,8001b. of tea The Arctic, from Canton, is also reported, but her cargo is understood to consist of drugs.
The amount paid into the treasury of the East India Holse for biUls on India from the 25th of February to the 9th of March was 82,6281.
An address from a large number of the prineipal persons engaged in the colonial produe ttrade was p resented to-day to Lord Palmnerston by MIr. James Cook and Mr. F raser, requesting him to become a candidate for the city.

Mr. E. Denison's Lecture At The Royal Institution.
MR. B. DEXISOI LECTUBBE AT THE .ROYAL
INSTITUTION.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMS.
Sir,-There is an error in the data for the production of certain tones from bells as given by lfr. E. Denison in hia lecture at the Royal Institution, and reported in your journalof to-day, which otght not to pass uncorrected
Mr. Denison's statement is, that " if a bel were made of 30 inches diameter, and it had a certain tone, then that a bel of 60 inches diameter would be a tone lower, provided the shape and thicmkness of both were relative."
Now, nature's law, which is immutable, is that a colamn of confined air double the length of another makes half the number of vibrations in the same time- it follows, therefore, that in a bell, where the length oi the column of air is controlled by the diameter, a diameter of 60 Inches wil produce a sound an octave, or six tones, lower than that ala diameter of 30 inches, and not one tone, as aserted.
Mr. Denison also states that " by some accident the weight of his great bel was increased two tons, and its thickness three-quarters of an inch, which raised the tone from E fiat to ." The true theory of this is that the extra metal in this case lessened the diameter of the beU instead of increarin; it, vhich is the usual effect of adding moro metal to a desDgn.
I am glad to find nison bas riven ut the idea of trying to do away with the " harmonics" of Ids bells, for if he bad come to the conclusion of its desirability ho never could have succeeded; the laws of " harmonics,'l bein
founded on nature, are true and unalterable, and to get rig of the harmonies of a vibrating instrament is to destroy the instrument itself.
I am no practical authority on the art of " boU founding," and I make these remarks in the interest only of the science connected with it. I have bcfore expressed my admiration of the result of Mr. Denison's exertions ; my desire now is that such good practical results may be shown to bo the con. sequence of having followed the true laws of harmony and sound.
I am, Sir, your obedlient servant.

Ife arrimAs last wek lwere improved but itil only moderate, with no Aenorlun four. The exportk were 3,339 quarters of wheat, 700!quarters of barley, 150 quArters of oats, 126 quarters of bean4 369 quarters of maize, and 4,996 sacks of flour. I
The receipts in wheat were-in home-grown, 7,927 quarters; foreign, 7,040 quarters.
The supply from the near counties s only roderate, and still mostly in poor condition; the ale was corlseiqently very heavy, except for the finest parcels, at eroniousrateg. The retail consumption of foreign continued at qtito as much money.
In flour tho arriVals were 16,061 sacks from the cotutrsy and 539 sacks from Bremen. The absonco of an AMOnca
supply did not affect prices which continued unaltered for all descrptions. I
The barley supply consisted of 4,298 'qrters native and 1,554 quarters foreign. The continued arcity of fine malting samples somewhat enhanced prices for euchlqualj ties, but other sorts only sold slowly at unchanged rates
In malt there was a fair trade at Is. per quarter adTAnce Oats wero more plentiful than of late, being ,In all 24,773 quarters, of which 17,500 were forelig (principally from the near ports), 2,400 Irihl, 2,377 Soteh, and the remainder English. Fine oat maintained their vYlUt, but dealers were still reserved in their purchses of inferior, which wero difficult to place.
Of beans there were 3,420 quarters foregn and 1,186 English; of poas, only 45 quarters foreign and 287 Eng. lisb. Teither of these pulse were altered in vlup, the tendency of prices being firm.
Without any arrival of linmod, and an export oi 1,610 quarters, the trade remained dull, but p of cak wrewo naintuined.
A good inquiry obtained for red clo seed, foreig
samples being 2a. per cwt. dearer. Whit seed and trefoil were as last quoted. Tarem fully as dear. Cauary and bempseed a slow sae, and, with other descriptions of ds, unchAnged.

The AssINTAWr-J ui briefly addressed the grand jury.
William Davenport, 18, sddler, was Indicted for felo. sously brealdng and entering a workshop, and stealing wo brass taps, value 8&
It appeared from the evidence that on the night of the Gth of February a lad named Stockings. who was in the service of the prosecutor, at 25, Wilson-street, having poticed three men lurking about bis master's shop-door, and having communicated to his mistress that he suspected they meant to commit a robbery if they could, hid him. oself and watched their proceedings. One of them opened the shop-door, -which just before had been secured by a 1~Alock; two went in, ard the third ke watch outside. Stockings wenit to a publiehouseocloseby, and toldt a man Damned Berry what he had seen, and they returned to the shop, where thoy-heard a sort of scudling nois inside. They held the chain to which the padlock had been attached, to prevent those who were incoming ont. Finding theirege
obstructed, the two who were inside pulled with all their
miht to get thedoor open, and they succeeded,but Berry glcolred one of them-thle prisoner-and held him until a 'ppliceman camae usp, notwithstanding that his corapanionL
icked hitm brutallyin a struggle that took place. Seing the neelessness of attempting to rescueLthe prisoner, the others escaped, and on an examination of the shop it was found that a glass show case hd been broken open, adn some brasgtapetaken away. The prisoner's cap wast ound on the counter.
Thoprisoner olemnlym asrtedohis iocence, and said h had been in the Crimea, where he had worked at his trade. On the night in testhon he and another o roung mran had been to a place about getting into the milita, and when ner the prosetor's promises a man asked them to help him to move a few thi5 away from a shop3, as be ws in arreaxs of renit, and wantedto cbeat thelandlord. They agreed to do so, and went to the shop, as they thought, for that pur. pose, when they, were interrupted by the witnesses, who chared'hima with committing a robbery.
Witnesses to character were called. They stated that the prisoner's father was a master saddler, and the prisoner bad been Working for him since he returned from the Crimea.
The jury foundhlm Guilty.
The AssMATr-JUDGE sentenced him to 12 months' hard labour, and ordered a reward of 5a to the witnesi Stocldngs and L. to Berry for their praiseworthy co9dtct.

To The Editor Of The Times.
TO THE XDITOR Op THE TIATES.
Sir,-In he Emcs of Yesterday an article appeared which, underthe title of "Liberty of the Press in Glasgow," has been copied into one of the Glasgow papers of to-day. It seems, with deference, to have been written under a complete misapprehension of tho actual circumances of the CaS; and as it contains a hope that " there may be some error in the report of the transaction," I beg to put you in possession of the fats, which will satify you that in this matter Scotland has " a good judge and a good law, aLnd that law properly appHed.
In the AVorth British DaiylaiZ of the 2d current there appeared a rbled and incorrect statement of what had ta en lace in the case of "Scotlandv. Gunn," wherein Ihad acted or the defender; and I immediately sent to the Aril the explanatory letter which appeared in its columns of the 3d current. As that letter contains the facts, and had apvarently not been. brought iander your notice when
rnting the article of yesterday, I think my shortest method is to enclose a copy of it. I also send exact copies of the warrauts granted, but not executed, against Mr. Wilson. I directyour specialattention to their dates, as proving the time which the gentlemen connected with the Herald had allowed them for consideration and consultationYiZ, from the 29th of December to the 18th of Febrary last. I also enclose the original article as it appeared in the Mail of the 2d of March.
You will specially note that it was not " idle curiosity" that prom,pted the question which was refused to be answered. That answer was absolutely necessary to ascertain the fact of the alleged authorship of the paragraph in question, in order to etabllsh my chent's special defence.
There was no qugetion affecting the liability or non. lability of the press. It was strictly a matter of evidence, which *very good citizen is bound to give. lad it been a mere matter of impertinent curiosity, no court of law in either England or Scotland would have alowed it to be gratified Mr. Sheriff Steele put no question whatever in tho matter. He interrogated no one, and would not havo issaod any wrrant unless ho had been speciall ked. Had he refused to do se he would ave failed in performing his duty. So far from being an
"inquisition," r. Steele positively refused to aUow his court, when requesed by the Herald, to be turned into a court of secret inquiry.
It ha3 been very much the fashion throughout the North to accuse l;~e Tic rs of railing at everything Scotch. I do notagree with that charge brought against your paper. I thkmy countymen should be much obliged to those who point out their faults and deficiencies ifi any); but there is certainly no excuse for ianofactunng subjects of complaint; and it is only when that is done that serious excetion should be taken to our articles.
enclose my card and s rnh 1

MELANCHOLY ACCIDENT.-An accident occurred
MEIWA&wCoLy AccmnIr.-An accident occurred on Sunday morning by which four men lost their lives by the sinking of an oyster.harge in the east arm of the Shorec hm harbour, between the canal and the beob. It appears that the Pearl oyster-smack came into hatbour that morning, and the barge in quesion was engaged to take tho oysters from the vessel to the oyster-pond, and about 10 "oICe, being laden with 80 tubs, tho bargo started from the vessel's side for that purpose, four men being oel board. It had ot to its destination, and the men had commenoed esting the oysters, when a squall from the north-west sprang pc, accompanied with rain. It is supposed that tho men took shelter under the cuddy in the foro part of the barge, and the ebb tide just cominencing caused the sea to rise and, unperceived by them, flled the barg's stern it water, and she foun. dared ahtuot in y. The barge ws not seen to go down, but being missed, search s made, and eventually a man'a hand a discovered outofthewater, and 'which led to the fol dislosure of the sad eabstrophe. What renders the affair the uore singalar is thit the barge within about 6 feet of the sbore, and that, with ordinaryexer tions, the men could hAve reached it in safet. They were discovered clasped to each other, and their odies were conveyed to a neighbouring pubichou60, awaiting a ooroner's inquest

EXTRAORDINARY CASE.-Dr. Charles Sumner, of
EXTRAORDINARY CASE,-Dr. Charles Sumner, of 31ochester, communicates the foliowing particulars of a case which caame under his practice to the Daily Unum of that -city:-" The subject was a young lady, 19 years of age, of ncervous temperament, very healthy, and the daughter of a resctable farmer in L-tternuts, Oteego county, NewYork. Sho first came to my office on the 28th of April 1853, to have a needle extracted from her left arm, which she said ' got in accidentally as she was moving a bundle of carpetdig.' This, a medium-sized sewing aeedle, was soon found aa extracted from the interior side of the forearm, about midway between the wrist and the elbow. In les than a reek she called again, saying she had another needle in her anm. I examined and found deep in the bend of the arm a hard substance, which proved to be a needle similar to the first, and accounted for in a similar manner. One week after this aix needles were found, deep in the flesh, about three inches from the elbow. On May 2,14 were taken out, higher and more on the posterior side of the arm. 30th, 17 -were taken fromthe arm and shoulders. Sr,ete of these were superficiaL lying just under the skin, bui. roost of them lay .deep in the 'lesh, and a number entirely under the biceps mnwcle. One oE large size lay with two-thirds its length imbedded in the brachial artery. Oae large darning needle was found lying directly on the bone at the intersection of *the deltoid muscle; this caused some inflammation and sup,puration, which led to its detection.

The whole number extracted durin2ithseonth of Jthe was 87; Setember, 10, Ootober,n , mosthy from the left breast andleft side of the abdomen. Aliot the last of November, 1853, she was at tackedwith violent spasms; these continued about three weeks, and subsequently a large number of needles were luonndin all paUts of her left side, from the shoulder to the kmee. When apparently asleep she would converse with her mother and.tell her where the needles might be found, but when awake she could seldom be induced to speak of them. Also, when in this eleepin; or romnambulic state she was -entirely unconscious of pain. While cutting through deep *nuscle, or in the moost seosit&ve parts, we never could perceive a motion indicative of feeling (a number were extacted in this sleeping state); on the contrary, when awake she -experienced acute pain, even from the least uinsion. rrom JaLnuary, 1854, no needles were found until the naiddle of the foUowing-summer, vwben she resorted to pins, - cutting -off 'the -heads antd thrusting them inato the flesh. Subsequently she used hairpinse, either straightened and put arin whoue, or the brokenx hlves. These were found deep in the large muscleAs of the thigh. Several pieees of wire and parts of the lArgest-sian of knitting needles, nearly bin in lengtbh, wrre found.lying directly-on the bone of thethigh on the' *anterior side. The whole number extracted was-of sewing aeedles, 297, andthese weresf all ises - pins, 67; darning ;aeedles, 2; hairpins, 5; knitting needles and wire, each S

She has a shipl ktter mail, 16 pasengers for Southampton, and seven for Hamburg, besides having landed 150 at Lisbon. The Teutonia brings xo cargo for this port, but has 1,200 tons for Hamburg, consisting of 11,090 bags of coffee, 1,700 bales of tobacco, *nd a quantity of ivory and other goods
Thero is no political news by this arrivaL
Commercial advices from lPio are to the 31st of January. In coffee limited supplies had kept the stock continually at alow fg*re, buing b-rely sufficient to meet the demand, and prices had in consequence slightly improved. Washed, 5,500 to 6,200 refs per arr.; superior, 4,900 to 5,100; good first, 4,600 to 4,800; regular, 4,400 to 4,500. The quantity in stock as reduced to 40,000 bags. In 'lour the stock had increased to 33,000 barrels in first hands, and the second was estimated to hold atout as much. Exports had been confined to a few cargoes for the Cape, and sales could under these circumstances only be effected at lower rates. Exchage operations had been of some importance for this conveyance-LonDonchiefly at from 27id. to28d; Hamburg, 650 reis; Parls, 343 to 345. In freights a large number of vessels in port, combined with a small stock of produce in hand, had kept the market in a depressed state. The rate for small vegsels for the Channel was 45s. to 47. 6d, miostly at the former rate; for the United States vesels had been taken up at 40c. for the North and 50O. for the South.
We extract the following from the Bahia PHixe Curvw of the 7th of February:-
" Sugar.-Transactions have been oa a limited scale at former prices of 3,200 reis per arroba for browns, and 4,200 reis for whites, with abatements * the hourly expected arrival of the Southampton steamer, the non-appearance of which is beginning to cause uneasiness, has in a great measure prevented both purchasers and sellers from coming into the market. Sales of browns in bags have also been effected at 3,200 reis for good quality; brown Nazareths are offering at 3,050 reis and 3,000 reis per arroba. At 5,200 reis and 4,200 reis per arroba, exchange 28id., sugar costs 30s; 4d. and 39s. 8d. per owt., free on board, exclusive of freight.
" Cotton.-Salos have been effected at 6,200reis per arroba for Mamcios, which at the exchange of 283L is equal to 6.31d. per lb. free on board, freight excluded.
" Coffee.-Supplies from the interior have considerably fallen off, and prices remain unaltered, at 4,300 reis to 4,400 reis per arroba. Exchange 28id., it stands in 43s. 9d. to 44s. 9d. per owt. free on board, freight excluded.
"Cocom-Unimportant lots which appeared in the market were eagerly purchased at 4,900 reis and 5,000 reis per arroba, according to quality, which, at the exchange of 28id., costs 49s. 7d. to bOs 6d. per cwt. free on board, without freight.
"Hides continue firm at our former quotations of 330 reis to 540 reis for dry salted, and 360 reis per lb. for dry, equal to about 1.Old. to 11.34d. per lb. for the former, and 12.19d. for the latter.
" Rum,-Sales continue to be effected at 1,100 reis per canada.
I Tapioca.-Prices of mandioca flour are still too high to encourage the manufacture of this article; the little brought to market finds purchasers at quotations.
"T Tobacco.-The market has been quietfor sometime, owing probably to the non-arrival of the Southampton steamer; supplies are coming in regularly, and holders demand 5,20l0 rein per arroba, for closed leaf seconds, and 6,200 rein for firsts, equal to about 51s. 5d. and 60s. 6d. per cwt. free on board, without freight, and at the current exchange of 231d."
rn freights no charters had been effected, and quotations were nominal and flat. Exohange transactions were
effected latterly at 284d. for 90 days' sight, and 28id. 60 | days'. Bills were offering at 28d.

Between 2 and 3 o'clock on the morning of Saturday last in the Bay of Biscay the schooner Smuggler, of 47 tons, Captain Young, of Cardiff, bound to Corunna wiith a cargo of coals, came in collision with the Teutonia, and went down directly. The steamer's boats were instantly lowered, but could only succecd in saving the captain, who was in the water three quarters of an hour. Three men and a boy were drowned. TXhe mate was William Stephens, of Plymouth, who has left a wife and family in Jersey; one of the sailors was Robert Jerrim, of Southampton ; the other's name we could not ascertain; the boy was James Downham, of Aberdeen. The captain, who came here in the Teutonia, lost everything he had on board. The schooner belonged to Mr. F. P. Carrel, of Cardiff.

WEAKNESS OF THE OPPOSITION.-In the days when
WlAXNESS OF THlE OrrosmoN.-In the days when the whole political world was divided into two great Btanding armies, to one or the other of which svery prominent man belonged, and between which the great body of the people fuctuated, it was beyond a doubt that the Government never could be beaten in debate, unless the feelng of the country was decidedly against them. A Parliamentary defeat then indicated a transference, more or less perma. nent, of the preponderance of numbers from their side to that of their opponents; and there could therefore be no question tnat an Administration formed by the latter wvould be able, at least for a time, to command a majority which would enable them to carry on the Government, But at present, though a defeated Ministry still, for the most part, thinks it necessary to resign, it is by no means so certain that its discomfiture indicates a preponderance of political power or popularity on the side of the Opposition, It is quite as likely thatthe victory has been gained by a temporary co-operation of parties disagreeing from one another as widely, or more widely than from the Government, but which 'happen to coincide in opinion, or can agree to vote together, on some partiolar point. Of this the division of Tuesday night afforded a remarkable example, and in such a case the resignation of the existing Government would simply throw the reins of power into the hands of a party habitually far weaker than themselves. The Ministry were not defeated by the Tories nor by the Peace pary; stil less by the Peelites or Lord John Russell. Neither of these partiee, if left to itself, could have commanded more than a tolerable minority. All united were able to obtain a bare success. Unquestienabl Lord Palmerstonis the head of bv farthelargest, thoughthe leastcompaot and disciplined, party in the EHoase of Commons. He can commanda tar greater support than any other poaible Mfinister could do. On most subjects he could insure a majority; but this especial topic was aptly selected to give the best possible chance to all factiously disposed enemies of the Government. The topic was one on which it was easy to make excuses for intripue and ambition, in the names of honesty, humanity, and independence; on whichat was easy to get up a strong prim4 fac6e case to attractpopularsympathy,to enticeunwary members, and on which, moreover, a certan number of members -not perhaps many, but enough to turn the scale-were certain tojomin a vote of censure which their principles would have directed them4do make far more severe. The ground was well chosen, and the generalship of the Oppoei. tion has won the day, but hevw to follow up a victory ganed by -such a motley force must prove a very perplexing question. in the meantime Lord Palmerston has expressed his determination to appeal to the country against the verdict of the Houseof Commons; and, as the constituencies are not quite as much asu fal of partys soves and coalition as their representatives, and inclined to look thereon with no friendly eye, we hope &nd believe that public opinion wil reverse the decision of Tuesday .night.-iMeudui.lr Guardian.

Ntotes of preparation for the coming truggle of paxtiessre sounding from all qtuarters of the country, and, although the result ntsy show that in Ireland the chauges in the representation vill be but fewr and unimportant, stil there is reason to believe that, few as they may be, they wiU at least indicate that the reign of delusion is fast drawing to a close. The time for the experiment is auspiciouz. There is no Titles Act, no Stockport riot, no bitter sectarian question-the Maynooth grant being disposed ofto influence the passions of the people, and constituencies are perfectly free to make an impartial selection of the candidates best qualified to guard their interests in the Legislature. Neither in Dublin city nor in the University is there any probability of a contest, and although the Liberal party in the former boats of a workng majority, no faith is to be placed in the asertion. The two Tories are therefore quite safe. In Dubhn county, however, there is a fair chance of displacing one of the sitting members, and should one of the Domville family he induced to taL-e the field there would be a sharp contest for the seat nowv filled by Colonel Taylor.. Mr. James Hans Hamilton is comnparatively popular with all parties, and it is sur-
undisturbed possession. Major Gavin, high sheriff of Limerick, and who saw some service in India while in the 16th Lancers, has been actively engaged for some davs in canvassing the city of Limerick, and it is stated that his address to the electors will be issued early this week. Sir Vere de Vere will offer his services if called upon by the Liberals, but not otherwise. The present members, MIr. F. W. Russell and Serieant O'Brien, will of course present themselves for reelection. NWo Conservative candidate is even hinted at. Belfast, the commercial capital of Ulster-perhaps of Ireland-has awoke from a long lethargy, and an effort will be made to return one supporter of the Palmerston policy.
A letter from Tralee speaks of the intention of the extreme Radical party to bring forward Mr. Alexander M'Carthy, formerly M.P. for Cork, inopposition to Colonel Herbert, one of the countymembers. Mr. M'Carthy has already had bitter experience of the cost of contested elections, and, as the burnt child dreads the fire, he will probably think twice before making, the attempt to displace one of the most respectable of the whole batch of Irish county representatives. There will be a run made by the Conservatives of Sligo county against the re-election of Mr. Richard Swift ; but the man for the situation is still wanted. Mr. Cooper, of Mckree, who would prove a most formidLble antagonist for Mr. Swift to cope with, has declined the honour, and an appeal is to be made to Major Ormsby Gore, who was ejected from the repretsentation in 1852 but as yet nothing decisive is known.o A Galway paper of Saturday produces the following full crop of rumouris respecting a host of candidates amxbitious to figure in the new Parliament:
"For the town of Gslway Lord Dunkellin and Colonel French are positively mentioned by their friends. Mr. Gregory is mentioned for the county. For Athlone we have the names of Mr. Edward Irwin, the owner of Faugha-Ballagh; Mr. O'Dowd, of Dablin, a member of the leal profession, and frierd of Judge Keogh; and Mr. Joh
Ennais, Chairman of the Midland Company. For Mayo Alexander Clendining Lambert, treasurer of the county, is named, as well as the Hon. Osoiry Brown. For Sligo Mr. Kelly, barrister, is put fonrard by his friends. In fact, the number of candidates we have heard of as having Galway town in contemplation exceeds by one the number of the Tribes-being actually 14!"t
The Nore Whig has some excellent remarks upon the state of the Irish constituencies, showing that they have got the best chance they ever yet had of securing a good representation in Parliament:-
" O'Connelism (rays the Whip), the dreariest of impostures, is quite dead, and with O'Connellism has almost totally disappeared that nasty animal which, in English apprehension, was ' The Irish Member,' a pauper fed by the whipper-in, at home a hanger-on of the priests, and in London a resident of the night saloons. Sadleirism, that acceededto O'Connellism, is dead too, and no constituenoy is novw to be wron by a mercantile or legal gentlemia ooming forward and declaning, in the name of God, that his patriotism is a passion, and that he will never take place. Independent partyism is not altogether defunct, but it is a secional affair, for not more than half a dozen counties and boroughs can be brought to believe that their Parliamentary interests are best served by their deleate consigning himself to utter impotencein London, and te delusion, such as it is, would be exploded altogether but that Mr. Moore unaccountably sinks all his talents as leader, and debater, and journalist, in recommending a chimera to simple peasants and pious young Dublin journalists. On the other side, the violent Orangeman candidate no longer answers in the market. Irish Toryism, like French Red Republcanism, has become tempered by civilization- and we trust to see the vices of long ascendancy stiUl further alleviated. Well, this absence or modification of isms is a great advan-
tage to electors really intent upon getting at a fair repre. sentative body. There is not an agitator in the country to distract or deceive. The Catholic hierarchy is quiescent from prevalent taste and a new policy. The Lord-Lieutenant cares a good deal more for his dignity than for his party, and we really look for a blessed minimum of Govern. ment jobbing. Now, all this is new in Ireland. It is the first time we have been out of a fever when caught by a dissolution of Parliament. They talk of a 'good cry' in England; but the word is too mild for us. We have gene. raUyhad a 'good roar' togotothecountryw.ith. One9twenty. At the last general election the Ecclesiastical Titles BiU was in men's minds, and with the Liberals it was all denunciation of the Whigs. Lord Derby was in ; and his friends on this side of the Channel made the utmost fuss about Protestantism. Mr. Deffy, and Mr. Lucas, and Mr. Keogh-all three now removed from the arena-were powers in the land, and frightful personal controversies ragedonal sides, and the general result was sending to Parliament, as an independent parts, a collecton of the gretever imposed on abpeople. All that rpesry years ago, andthebitter lesson cannot !be quite forgotten."s
SNOWSTORMA.
A fortnight's run of seasonable weather was interrupted on Saturday evening by a sudden fall in the mercury and an immediate change in the state of the atmosphere. All at once the cold became intense, and in the course of the night several heavy showers of snow fell. In the morning the whole face of the country was covered, and throughout yesterday shower rapidly followed shower, each being accompanied byaflerce squall of wind from the w estward. Altogether the day was one of the most inclement of the new year-.

CONrrENECE IN LORD PALXEgRSTON?
Belfast, like Manchester and like Liverpool, has pronounced for Lord Palmerston unequivocally and emphatically. A great meeting of the Liberal party was held on Saturday, at which the following resolution was enthusiastically carried:-
" That we regret that, by an unnatural coalition of discordant parties, the Government has sustained a defeat which compels an immediate dissolution of Parliament by a decision which we look on with great alarm, as fraught with immiuent danger to our fellow-subjects and embarrassments to the eervants of the Crown in our distant colonies, and we therefore feel it our duty to declare our entire confidence in Lord Palmerston's Government, and our determination to assist in returning to tbe House of Commons for this borough two members who will support his Administration so long as it is conducted on the principles which bave hitherto been his guide."

Mr. Wlliam Henn, one of the four Mfasters in Chancery, expired suddenly this morning at his residence in Merrion-square. It is said that the vacant mastership will not be fZn:ed up, as the office has been so recently as Wednestlay last declared by the Attorney-General to be univesally condemned.

The Central American Treaty.
THE CNZAP: iMErUCN TREATY.
(From the UV .-, n Jior7 Feb. 2L)
The neoes ty of Srmly rediting all attempts to inveigle the United Stateg intO ant Prership or oo-operatio with Great Briain in i their poiy wih regard to ths tihnent, anjioet uspecialyto the States of Cetlo Anmerica, is deily more empUaticall; denocatraeL The United Sttta a
rant no such paerp, to ch co operation. Tne right
asserted by~ Great Bditain to an interference with the ffairs1 of Central Amerca either bse on heer tsunyon or on pretenceB having TO oendatioyn whatever,or at least none that can suti claim. of ich magnitude, and so vitally Injrious to the United States The acanowleda ent on the pa2t oitetheetion of th athat Great Britain had a night to becomue a party in regukating their policy in relation to Central America, which ws virtually done by the Clayton-Boiwer Treaty, has been one great source of all the accumlakting difficulties in that quarter. By ber own interpretation of that treaty Great Britain is abeolutely guaranteed in her right to the protectorate of the Mosquito., whil, the United States are restrained in all future time, and under all circumstances, from making any acquisitions by purchase, cession, or conquest in Central America, however necessary they may be to counteract the eneroar,ents of Great Britain in that quarter. The United States have tied themselves hand annd foot, while Great Britain is left free to pursue a sys. tem of intrigue, buUlyig, and encroachment, the inevitable consequence of which must be either the possesdon, or at least absolute control, of a region of more vital consequence to the United Stateg than half the world besides. And why was inch a treaty made ? The ostensible object Wa to associate Great Britain s a guarantee of the freedoa of the conternplated ahical to connect the Pacific and AtlanticOceans. And why was such a guarantee xequired? The only parties to this great undertaking were the United States and the State of Nicaragua, both equally independent, and equally entitled to make such an arrangement without the assent or co-operation of any other Power whatever. Yet Great Britain was invited to co-operate. She condescended to accept the invitation, and her co-operation bas hitherto consisted in. throwing every obsacle in thewa of the ssibility of the completion of this greatundartaking, both now and for ever. The United States have reognie her asapartnerin the bnsiness, and
yven a right, or atleetapret, to interfere. The Clayton.tulwer Tatylias createan indissoluble entanglement, and so long as Great Britain continues to act on its own interpretation of that instrument, and the United States content themselves with "argafying' the question, the one is free to purse its insdious PolicY in Central America, and the other is in duty bound, according to the L-ondon Tima, to pasnutrality laws which effectually arrest all efTorts to corret althe blunders of forimer Administrations. By making a catapaw of Costa Rica, which she has taken under her " protection," and incited to lay claim to one bank of the river San Jusn which the had formally- relinquished by treaty, and by extending her Mosquito protectorate to the Fopther bank, she is inis fair 'way of attaning the entire command of the great, the only connecting link of navigation between the Atlantic and Pacific, and with it the entire control of Central America That she will do so, and that General Walker is now almost the only obstacle to the success of the plot, s we think, becoming every day more evident.
hile the United States sleeps, Great Britain ig wide awake; while one is triumphant in argument, the other is at work in constant action, and it may be taken for granted that Great Britain will be always willing to ne. gotiate, while the United States continue in the mneantime to acquiesce in her doing jwt as she pleaFes, and content themselves with proving that she is in the wrong. The policy of Great Bntain, though it may not amount toaetual war, is direcftly hostile to the interests and honour of the United States, and is the more insidious and insulting from being perpetually woupled with professions of cordial amity and friendship. If resistnce or counteraction should produce wvar, open wr is better than secret hostility, and the nation which shrlnks from that alternative from apprehension of its consequences must make up its mind to submit to everything. surely, some decisive stand should be taken to counteract or; if necessary, resist this dangerous underhand policy in Central America.
(From the Few York Couricr and Enquirer.)
An article from the Union has excited much attention in poltical circles, as being, perhaps, an index of the policy of the incoming Administration towards England. If it really is such, there is, indeed, reason for a sensation. Its spirit is hostile; its cnarges untrue; its demands unjust; its sentiments insulting and unwarrantable. The Administrationwhich should shape its practicd action in a way at all corresponding would inevitably involve the country in dificulties with England from which' there would be no escape but either concession on our part or actual war.
The special aim of the article in the Union is to defeat the treaty lately negotiated at London by Mr. Dallas and now before the Senate; but in doing this it takes ground upon which no treaty of any kind with England respectinCentral America would be possible. It is denied that 1Englandhss any rghtfulvoice whatever upon the affairs of Central America. It is claimed that the United States has a natural right to regulate its policy towards Central America in accordance with its own interests without interference from any other nation on earth The Clayton-Bulwer Treaty is denounced foi ,ving recognized that England had an interest and voi.iIn its subjectmatthr. Itis charged that the English Governmentis using this treaty as a cover under which, by plausible interpretations of its own, to push its hidden encroachments, and obtain the entire control of Central America, and that it has so far succeeded that General Walker is now " almost the only obstacle" it has in the way of attaining the full command of the great link of navigation between the Atlantic and Pacific. The organ winds up by declaring that open war is preferable to continued sufferance of this policy.
It will strike every reader that these imputations upon England re in singular contrast with the language held by the Foreign Secretary in the debate at the late opening of Parliament. Said the Earl of Clarendon, in answer to the Earl of Derby, " I agree with the noble lord opposite that we have no interest whatever in Central Amenca beyond that of possegsing a free transit across the Isthmus, and I cannot see why upon that question there should in future arise any difficulty between us and the United States " Here we find the head of the Foreign Department expressing his entire concurrence with the avowal of the leader of the Opposition, that England has no objectto secure in Centra America beyondafree transit in common with othernations. This explicit declaration, however, will be styled by the Union as sheer hypocrsy It affects to put no faith in professions. It finds its account simply in putting down the English Government as a thing with wFhich deception is systematic, and utterly unfit to be trusted. It is unnecessary to say that if that feeling ever extends from the newspaper organ to the American Administration itself there must be an end to the friendly relations between the two Governments. When one party in any affair of liBe has fully worked himsef into the belief that the other party is a liar and a scoundrel it is idle to calculate upon a continuance of concord.
But there is nothing whatever that can justify or excuse these coarse imputations of the Union upon the good faith of England. Through all of the late negotiations the British Government, instead of evincingany disposition tooverreach, has acted with great Uberality. Wbethertheword "occupy" in the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty was prospective imnply in its application was a question fairly admitting doubt. The two Governments could honestly differ. The offer of England to leave the proper construction to the arbitration of any third power indicated anything but a dihbonest, exacting, rapacious spirit. Its prompt acceptance of the proposal of Mri Marcy to reopen negotiations upon the subject on the very heels of the dismissal of Mr. Crampton, and the concessions which it made in its negotiations with Mr Dallas, giving uxp the exclusive protectorate of the Mosquitoes, and relinquishing the Bay Islands to Honduras,
show a liberaL not to say a magnanimous disposition, which would be a world's blessing if brought to bear upon all international disputes. What was the condition of the two parties at the outset? The United States had not a title, nor the colour of a title, to the possession or the jurisdiction of a single square inch of ground in all Central America. So far as respects legal rights and interests, it had just as much claim upon the county of Elants, or upon the province of Silessa, as upon any portion of America between the Rio Grande and Cape Horn. It was not so with England. That nation did have claims, which were based upon ancient usge and pest treaty stipulations with Spain, obligatory upon the successors to the S nish torritory, and also upon a dc facto occupation and colonization by British subjects. It has been a question whether these claims are valid or not
but,. though their validity be disputed, yet England, in the eye of the impartial world, with her colour of
liim, stood better in Central America before the Clayton-BulVer Treaty than car own country, with no Claim at all, or any pretenoe to a claim. Before that treaty we had no legal part in the business at aU ; it w&q a matter which England, had she been tenacious of her extreme rights, might have claimed should be settled between herEelf alone an the States directly interested. But she consented to recognize our indirect interest, entered into argument with us in vindication of her claims, made a treaty with us, by which she relinquished all hold upon Greytown, the most import^antpoint in the whole region, and took us into partnership as a o- guarantor of the freedom of a shipcanal to unite the two oceans; and by the treaty now under consideration in the Senate she practicalAy -re
lnqubsnes alu clatus whatever upon any portion of Central America. And yet, in the face of all this, the Union taxes England with rapacity and perfidy in all her dealing with this business, and proclaims its readiness to resort to war rather than continue to submit.
It is not very difficult to discover the real source of the
Union's dissatisfaction The obnoxions treaties, garanteeing the independence of the Isthmus and preparing it to
become the great free highway of nations, do not taUy weU with the schemes of slavery propagandists and annexationists; and, should Walker once establish himself, there is no saying how much they might embarrass his subsequent operations. England must not only relinquish every claim of her own in Central America, hut mnust agree to igive us fxul
swing there to do as we please, and every treaty which does not accord this must be torn in piees The United States is henceforth and for ever to be everything in that part of the world, and England nothing; otherwise there is to be no peace. We not readily believe that the Union here foretokens the-policy of the new Administration, thongh we cannot deny that the Ostend Circular, the Cincinnati resolutions, an the appointment of the England-hater General Cass to be Secreta-ry of State, are not very cheering precursors We still prefer to think that the Dallas Treaty vil yet be ratified ay the Senate, and that the liberal and
paciic spiritinwhichthat treaty was nceived wil inSDirethe whole pEolicy of our Governmenttoewards England or the next four years. To bnUly Engand aA drive her to

Joseph Swift,ofLmndhill, mlner.-Ihave been employed at the Lundhill pit for 17 3month. I was working night hift dung tlhweek of the exploion, andfton the morn-
ing of the 19th of Febmary some hours before the explo- I son. I worked on the fith boerd on the soth fide. I eft i the pit about half-pest 2 o'lock on the morning of the exrploiono. Iha no reaon to complain of the ste of the pit-
it was in a good stte Tlhem wa plent of entilation.{ have no complaintto make a st the nIerirordsteward or anybody elsm connected with the pit. tI hink the explosion must have arisen by some fall of roof, driving gas out ofthe aves; I cannot think of any other oase
By Mr. orton.-M work-place was the leading, not the following vp, bank. * kave worked in that bank sinto a fortnight befora Christmas, and have never seen any gas tcere. I have een the firemen try the goof behind me, who said they found noAgas as far as they eould get into it. They could seldom et more than two yards into it, because itf so close up. shave always worked with candles in the pit. I have ometimes seen a Ettle gu in boardgates. .I hive seen a little in the first boardgate on the!north side, where I formerly worked. I did not work with ams at that time, but had brattioe boards about four yardsrom the face. In my bank there hxve several times been great aud sudden fills of roof. Never saw any gas after the fall, and I generally stoppedwitl my candle to ee whether there Ws any gaK
Whit has been the custom with regard to trap-doors in your part of the pit ?-They were kept shut, except when the boys d to open them for the corves to pss. I don't know that they hive been left open at any time in any pae. of the pit. The ventilating furnace, so far as I know, was all right on the night before the explodon; but I did not see itmyself. There are men to attend tothe furnae.
By the Foreman.-I never knew the lads leave the trapdoors open after the corves had ped throug.
George Burrows, miner, LundhilL-I woried in the dip boards at the Lndhillu oolery. I was on the night shift, and left at 4 30 on the morning of the explosion. Whero I worked, wlhich was a long way from anybody else, there was no gas. I have no complaint to make about there being gas anywhere. I have no complaint at all to mal-e about the workings.
The Coroner.-Canyouform any opinion as to the cause ofthe explosion?-My opiniox is that it has ariset from a fall of the roof in the goaves (old workings), and was beyond the control of the steawards or anybody eke. 1 cannot, however, give any correct opinion upon it. I think the gas in the goaves was out of the reach of the fire-triers
By Mr. Morton.-I think the fall of the roof was on the north side, but I cannot say whereabouts. I worked in the third boxrdgate for a weec seven or eight months ago. From there I went to the fourth bo.rdgate, andworked there for sixweeks, afterwhich I worked in the fifth board. I afterwards worked 10 days in a alit in the fifth boardgate, and then went to the dip workings.
Hive you seen any gas in any of these places -There were several little b lowers " of a whie I was Inthe fourth board, but nothing to do any harm. We always had brattice boards, about 15 or 20 feet from the face. I also saw blowers in the fifth board-not anywhere else.
Have you worked with candles or lamps when there have beenblowers ?-When there was a bit of gas in the " hole " in a morning I used to take lamaps for myself or hurrier. I had orders to do so from Warhurst and Corbridge the firemen. They had found the fire on examining in tihe morning, and gave me the orders to take the lamps when I went to work. I always took lampe when told to do so, and used them until the gas was worked out of the " hole " (workplace).
Who decided when yon should put out the lamp and light the candle ?-We used our own judgment about that.
Is that really so ?-Yes.
Rule 18 says when men are ordered to use lamps they shall do so until they receive counter orders fom the firemen or underground steward. Did you follow that 7-No; I have never seen that followed since I have been there. We used the lamps until we thought it ufe to work with candles, and then put our lamps out. The firemen seldom came to us after giving us orders to work with lampg.
Did you ever see other miners besides yourself act in opposition to the 18th rulo ?-No.
By the Foreman.-I have never-heard any of the workmen complin of a deficiency of air. I have not heard of any complAint from any one. When the firemen gpve me a lamp they used to tell me to use it until the gaa was worked out of the place. They only sometimes came to see me after giving me lamp. I carefully ascertained that the hole was ree rom gas before I used a candle after a lamp had been given to me.
John Thompson, miner, West Melton.-I havo worked at the Lundhill C olliery 11 months. I ws on the nightahift during the week of the explosion. I wvorked on the left-hand leaing bank on the south side. I have not seen any gas in my bank. There were no brattlce boards there. The air is good. I have always worked with candles. Never saw any gas in that bank, and have worked in it six months. Imhave not seen the firemen try the goaves; they did that before I went down. I cannot sav what wsthe causeofthe explosion. I have never mae any complaints as to the state of the pit. It has always been in good order when I have worked.
By Mr. Morton.-The boy at my trap-door was fetched away during the last night e fore the explosion, I being the only person who had to pass through it. The trappers left the doors at dinner and gapper time. I have knovwn them do so, and be awvay nearly half-an-hour at dinner-time and an hour in the night time. It was only occasionally they left the trap-doors in the day time, bnt it was a regular custom for them to leave at supper time during the night I have not complained of this, but the firemen have known of it, for I have seen them at the cupola at the same time that the boys (trappers) were there. I had not seen this for some weeks before the explosion. Never heard the firemon reprimand the boys for leavinz the trap-doors. The firemen have visited me during thoe hift in addition to examining the workings before I went to work. Fire signals have never been placed in mT hole. The firemen always visited me during the day shift. I hivo not always seen them during the night shift, having been occasionally absent. I have not seen the firemen try the goaves lately. They may have tried them when I have not been there. I have not tried them myself. There was a fall of roof in my bank on the Monday before the explosion. We have not been subject to great and sudden falls; they have been
cradnal. Have not observed gas exude when there have been Halls. Have not seen gas explode in the pit for a long time. The blowers generaUy oocnrred In the board. They were not frequent. Have not known anybody burnt by them. I have seen them blaze when a candle has been near in the fourth board on the south side. The brattices were wel up and there has been a strong ind at the face when the blowers have blazed We have kept on working with candles after the blowers have blazed and the blaze has been put out.
By the Foreman.-The miners have continued working durng the night shift when the trappers have been away at supper. We have not got our suppers at the same time. I have never heard the fremen find fault with the trappers for leaving the doors. I have been near enough at times to hear if they had done so.
By a Juryman.-Where I have worked the pit was well ventilated. I had to tram for myself, and it was when I went wth my corves during supper time that I found the trappers aw ay from the doors.
By Mr. Peacocl-There would be coals hurried through the doors when the trappers were arayfrom them at supper and dinner time.
John Robinson, miner, Wembwell.-I have worked at the Lundhili Colliery nearly ever since it began. On the night before the explosion I worked on the lef-hand bank in the
econd boardgate on the south side. I left the pit at 3 o'clock on the morning of the explosion. My ank appeared as safe thenasI had ever seen it. I had no complaint to make about the management of the pit, except that there was so mnch air that I could scircel,y keep my candle in.
By Mr. Morton.-I know that it duty to complain to the fireman or steward when I see r7es broken. I aon't know that I have seen any rules broLen. I havo never seen any gas in my bank. I have worked a deal in gas, and know when there is any. The fireman alwayg tried the goaves. When I was at work I saw him do so. The fireman went round the works before we began, and nearly always aain before we left. I have worked in all parts ef the pit. I have seen Is in the boardgtes, more particularly in Nos. 2 and 3, on t e north dde. The coal makes a little gas in all the boards, but when the brattioes are kept well up it is caried away as It is emittedL At every boardgate face there has been a little gas made. I have been working in mybank only for the last three months, and can't say whether my boardgates have made more gas than usual during that time.
By the Coroner.-I cannot form any opinion as to the cause of the explosion.
By the Foreman.-The gas in the boardgates exudes szwe work the coaL It wasnot more than is usual in pits.
By a Juryiman.-Did not Tunnercliffe tell you he had heard a great noise, as of a fall of roof, on the night before the explosion, which so alrmed him that he advised his father not to2° to work next day 9-No. There isa Tannercliffo in the pit, and one is not killed.
Edward Simmonds, miner, LundhilL-I was working in dipbo eto the east, 140 yards from the drawing ; bottom, at the time of the explosion. John Elis and
Thnomas Bellwere working wit me, and both escaped. After the explosion I ran towards the pit bottom. I met the after damp, which nearly choked me. After lying until the fresh air came, I proceeded to the pit bottom. ,I cannot say whether it was before or after half-past 12 at noon vwhen the explosion occurred. Thomas Hammerton, his son, and Thomas Hitching were working in the straight boardgate at the time of the explosion an escaped. We worked with candles. I could not see ay difference in the state of the piton the day of the explosion as compared with other days. I have no complaint to make as to the management of the pit. I cannot form any opinion 'as to the cause of the explosion. I have anephew among the kIlled. I cannot blame any one for the explosion. I cannot form any opinion as to where the explosion originated.
By Mr. Mortone-I heve worked in the pit three months; I have been employed in the dip boardgate all the time. Do not know the stato of the pit, except in that part where I worked. Have been a miner all my life, and been used to work in fiery pits in Cumberland. Never heard of any complaint as to the state of the pit. The brattice boards are required to be within three la from the face. There were brattie boards at the end ot the slits, but they were 20 or 30 yArds from the face of the boardgates. There were no trapdoors in my boardgate.
By Mr. W. Johnson.-I think the Lundhill pit as safe as any I ever worked in.
By Mr. Morton.- Ihave worked in the Oaks pit, where a serious explosion occurred some years ago.
Dand Xollngs, miner, of WombwelL-I was working in the first boardgate on the north aide of the Lundhill pit on the day of the explosion. I was driving the left-hand boardgate. I left the pit a fewf minutes before the explosion oc-
urred along with lAohard Thornton, George Blackburn, Chasrles Marison, and three others, whose names I do tot knovr. I came out of the pit because I bad no picks to, work 8:th-not bqo I apprqhonded any danger, I hiA

It was the duty of the fire. mnen, William Illingworth, Willim Beovers, Joespb.

I did not, before ooming out of thepit on. the day of the explosion, bea the noise of any fall of the, roof. Have not beard of anybody else hearing such a nouse.
By Mr. W. Johnson.-When the brattice-hoards wereseven yards from the facing I bad plenty of air, and appre-. bended uo danger.
By Mr. Mortou.-I have not worked an hour with lmp-. since I entered the pie. I bave never been ordered to do.
By the Coroner.-I cannot torm any opinion as to the, canse of the explosion.
William Hubbershaw, of Wombwell, miner.-Iwasworking 200 yards from the shaft, on the north Aide of the. pit,
when the explosion took place, I wag on the low aidoof the level, between the second and third boad-gate.
William aud John Dondkin and Joseph Simmionds. were working with me. Simmonds left us when the, explosion occurred and went towards the sft. Heperished. We lay four hours in our hole. kept pI n up my hands, and found the air so hot that Io gnot th

WMere I was working the pit wua In a good tte but it. wasin abad stateelsewhere. Theprincipalaiwybetween the third and fourth boardp-gat h been down for th
months. The rubbish in the aurate hx6 boen as high as thecoal ever sunce I have worked there. It wa atolowing np board.gato It had fallen in togucha degree that they could not hurry down it, aud could only just creep over t I worked in that place six weeks or inore, end twsi ht. state the 'whole of the time, end I left it intat sftate some weeks ago. I do not know the name of the men who wasworking in the night shift up to the time of the exlolon.
Thea man on the day shift is still in the pit. It is lweek, sinee I left it. TIhey started a two yards wide following-np board-gate to get to the face, but that feU inalso. The airway had fallen in for a length of 20 or 3Dyards. The airway was not entirely destroyed, but wan. much sm1aler than it ought to be. Another war was made
for the air to take. I have en Mr. Coe at the place, andseen him turn back in preference to creeping over the fallen rabbish. He knew xll about it, The last the I was in I saw Mr. Coe go over it to measure the workings of the nen. I have made no complaint to Mr. Coe or the firemen about this airway having allen inr, because I knevr that they fre-
quently went tbere and knew all about it. I knew that theectonal area ought to hvI been 30 feet, but never oemplauned that the rule in that respect wsbein7 rkr
What weould be the effect of the tumbngbrikn.O hsar
way as regards the men at the hank faces 5-Not half tho" fuUlquaufity of air would go ap there. I have never seen the asr measured.
By the Coroner.-Six weeks or two months ago there wasa dexl of packing behind, and I complained to young Mr. Coe and Warhurst. They said there were plenty-
worse off than I was. was in the followig-upo bank, and was 20 yards without a single pak.
The packing was 20 yards bebind, when six yardEr, were put up one day and four the next. The anking -. never 9uite completed white I remained there, but I understand it is well packed nowv. It is not safe for the packing. to be more than thom four to six yards behind. The packwalls ae to keep the roofs up and the air in its proper course, and there is great danger of falls when it is farbehind. The reason the packing got behind wa, that Mr. Coe, when be came to the pit, reduced the wcs of the packers as much as Is. a-day, and the good packes left us. Farm labourers and other men came In their places, who know nothing about it. Only about four orfive out of the 13 or 14 packers know anything about a pit. The packerg sometimes worked with a large oil lamp, and'
sometimes a Davy lamp. Have see ithem r ul thegauze off their Davy-lamps, and work without it. The - packers had safety-lamps, but stripped off the gauze to work with, and put it on again on going out. The lamps were not locked, or they could not have done so. I he
seen Warhurst, the fireman, and young hr. Coo go tothe packers when they were working with oil lamps, and Davy lamps without gauze. It was afe where they were working. It was right enough to haveean oil lamp in some, places; but they ought to have a safety lamp in the goaves.
hese ignorant persons would not know how to put their lights out or their gauzes on it fire came, and it mnight ie, safe at one moment and very dangerous the next, as, forinstance, in the case of a fall I have not complained to - Mr. Coo about this. He genelly told us to speak toWarhurst or his son if we id anything to him. I got ab copy of the rules three weeks before the explosios; for the
first time. I have seen the trapsers go intothLgoaves - with their Davy lamps, and then, when they found no ga, take the gauzes off:
By Mr. Morton.-I have worked at the Lundhill pit for
nine months, and never had a copy of the rules until three, weeks before the explosion. Some few had them before. A great many copies of the rules were given out three weeks before tho explosion, thoemen being told that they must either take them or leave. I did not hear o anybodyob'Lecting to take tb em.
The Foreman.-Were there no ways for the air to go0which was impeded by the stoppage in the airway yoe
have mentioned ?-Yes. (Witness pointed out the direction in which the impeded air woul o.)
By Mr. Morton.-Both in the bae and goat, which this. impeded airway was intended to venileate, there would bedlanger of ga accumulating.
Byv the Foreman.-The sir which oould not get through. the obstructed airwvay, and went in the direction I havo pointed out, would not get to the bank face which the obrtructed ainrway was intended to ventilate,
The inquiry was proceeding when our despatch lef.
Water continues to be poured into the pit, and it is expected that more than a week will yet elapse before it will have risen to the height necessary to extinguish the fire. It
will require several weeks to get the water out again, so thatt. a month orsix weeks will probably elapse before any of thoebodies can bo recovered, and no hope is entertained thatany of the bodies wil be recovered in suchh a state as to be capable of identification.

The New American Cabinet.-The appoint-
TEE NEW AmRICAN CAB132T.-The appointment of General Cass to the inportant office of Premier to the incoming Administration appears to have been partly an act of necessity and partly a stroke of policy. Our latest special despatch from Lancaster gives some of the reasons for the reconsideration of the case of General Cass, and for tho final resolution to give him a trial. But there are still other reasons which have had their due influence over the mind of Mr. Buchanan, and which are worthy of consideration. As our Lancaster correspondent informs us, Mr. Buchanan had concluded to dispense with General Cass, and mainly on account of hisage, the venerable Senatorhaving passed the boundary lineof three score years and ten.
Next, thePresidentelecthadalmostdecidedtomakeMr. Cobbthe head of the State Department from his sound Conservative antecedents and from his vigorous qualifications for the laborious duties of the office, when this Walker orSouthern ultra conspiracy in the camp was organized at.. Washington to break down Cobb. and to give a Southern fire-eating aspect to the new Administration in the appointment of Walker. But Cobb, it appeara, would not oonsent. to play second fiddle to the fire-eaters, nor was Mr_ Buchanan inclned to surrender, while tbev were willing upon a pinch, to accept anything exceptCobb, fortheycould not forget the battles n mwhich he had beaten them. In this. dilemma of the family Mr. Buchanan has simply split the difference by giving the State Department to General Case ancl, the Treasury tolr. Cobb, leaving Mr. Walker out altogether.
General Cass is old. He is hardly equal to the laborious. requirements of from 12 to 14 hourse hard official work, upon which Marcy appears to have fattened considerably.. But General Cass has had a vast amount of diplomatic ex-
perience as Senator, as Foreign Minister, and as a Cabinet; member heretofore. lis knowledge and experience thusacquired will be valuable to Mr. Buchanan at the outset of his administration, and very sful in puttin the new, machinery into motion. Wen this haLU ave beea accomphihed, should General Casm find the active, demands of his office suporior to his trength he. will retire, and Mr. Cob b wi, by right of pro. motion, sucooed him. Thus General CaBS and his friends, wil be atisfied, and in due season the fulfilment of the original design of Mr. Buchanan will be quietly brouht about. -ut the most imaportant signfcation of this app t.. went of General Came this ap lutment of Howell Cohbb, and't this setting aside of Mr. Wa er, lies i the fact that itisa shot betweeR wind and water to the fire-eating, disunion agitIL seessionists of the Souith. General Case, sideby side with Clay and Webster, was the Democratic leader in the Senate in behalf of the peat compromise moasures of 1850; Mrz. Cobb was the most conspicuous Southern Democratic advocato of those measures in the House
Their appointment, therefore, to the two most important positions in Mr. Buchanan's Cabinet is e quivalent to the positive and emphatic restoration of the Union Conservative poUcy comprehended in those healing measures of 185O ;and it isea declaration of war against all fire-eating disunionists of the Southern Jefferson Davis school on theone hand, and against all seditious agitators of ' no morm Slave States," of the school of the VanL Buren democracy, the Seward Republicans, and the Abolitionists of the North, on the other hand. These appointments of Cass and Cobb are thus a proclamation from the President elect of a return to that Union policy upoin which Percoe was elected, but which in the very act of appointing his Cabinetpoor Pierce deserted and betrayed. Thus xIr. Buchanan. heedful of the eloquent warning of poor Pierce's melan-
ate, has tken care to avoid the rocks and! boh. upon which this outgoing dynay has beea"= ked,
and to start in the safe and clearly marked channer-of theUnion and the Union sentiment of the eountrv. The secessionists will doubtless rebel and show fight. They will, conspire to coatrol or to harm and to cripple the new Adminustration in every possible way and at every asaable point. Mr. Buchanan is doubtless prepared for all1 this; and let him only stick to the course vhich hle haadopted, and all the little defections, and plots, and tricks,. and outbreaks of rebellious cliques within the church Wi
be tenfold compensated in sunport of the Union-loving an-& CEonservative people, not only of the Democratic party,. but of I parthes and all sections of the Union.-NeWo York, Ecrc2d~, F'eb 24.
