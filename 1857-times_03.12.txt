TIhis Comnpsny is formned wgith limited liability, under the provisions of the"Joiut-Stoel;Com1,anies' AO lsS6,"forthe purpoes of bringing into general use BtydeLps Patent Traction Engine and Endless Rail-
Fior this object conditional arrangemente (whbich may be ascertained wpon applicaton to the Secretory have been entered into for thegpsdr.hate of the patent right for Great Britain ard Ireland and the Chamnei Islands, which, vhile advantageous to the s arebolders, witl mrae tho remoneramyt n for Is in a great measure dependent on the suoenes of the undertaking.
This invention is of national importance, as it removes the only difficulty hitherto experiencved to making ates;n trsetion profitablyavail. able, beth upon common roads and for agricultral purposes.
The wrorking and the powver of the Tracdion Engine and Endless RaUlway on common roads have been folly and satisfactorily teeted t oeoomich before a Commit ee appointed by tbe Govemuorpt, and aelo at oilier places,and the foiltowng Important results5 obtained-viz that, en the beetuordinry roads, the heavient loeds can be drawin with greater economy than by homepo aer; aud that, in ascendine or descending the steepest hil, or on pasbsing over soft and marsay ground, where nO rodsd exist, thim Engine and bRaila bhave been foand to overeome dingtoltIes dewich no available amount of hO O poer ounld
For arivultual operations the experiments have proved Li pOEslbles oven more tisctory, inemuch as land plotghed at ferent lace in the dreaene of a very larb e number of practical aricmlt dbts, has been a rcom ntleh by tbem to have been bettor e ooe nt an by horses,
-TUeShe L otUdi of cost hl a been wariously estmted b o om 40 tO 70 per eent., accordin to the desripbton of the work dns, and osse uing this
sreat advantage, that, in ploughteg ol soft or bet grbound, the Endleds ailway drawgne do iinitely less harm to thesLandhu n the horses' feetInudrwig the Dlouilmr- Ploughinz to a depth ltmost imposible to ascomplish by horses, has been both efciendtly and eoonomlcali performed by means of this invention.
The Endlces Ralwtay, when worked by hor, is sacelr of less Imeortanse s the dower v enulsote to drawl aggons aln carts fitted with itover io tgroul and troads will In all eases be Immensely diminished, ad they can be taken over land where, without SI, it would he imDOhisl to drawr them by horse- wer. On aeCount of thetr sinking up to the axter, ralmes would s be able to cathoverntheirneoftedt Do worked bytit. As nithout doing Liutf to It.
The T actiou zmothl or Dtted l l the Ery
is bet a engine,yan when r ndea to anee prtailway peeg esses al the advantages of the Portable orStionary Engine, wIth the great additieona one, that it can transport ibtelf where required witaout the aid of heoese, nd drar with it threshng machines, corn mills, scutching mills, ploughs, or any other implements intended to he worked by It, Anothervey implnortant feature of it is, that the enin passing so zroothlr, over she Endless Railway, the machinery Is liable tofar less injury ndwer andtear than a portable engine draw oaordLns wheels.
A s afeeder to tne god'taffic of rallws, by sopeseding the neseestb ot short and expesie branch lines, espcisiixa thbinypoDnlated diabtic4a, the advantages of the Tracon adndles Railway can scarcely be overrated.
Traction engines, wish such improvements ag haye been uggeed in the varous experimenta recently made, are in coume of costruction tor the British Government, and others re nerly ompleted for r- vite lndividazls, whiclh wll afford additfonal opportunities of Juing of the ecldncy and economy with which theymay be xsed.

This Company rests its claims to public support on two plain considerations--1st, that the steam comparies alreadynavigpting the rivers of India re realirng large profits; and 2nd, that tbe veSels of this Company will, by the aid of improvements to which it has the exclusive right, be able to carry three or four times the quantity of cargo that can be carried by the vesels at prewent employed. Cheap conveyanoe is necessary to India to enable the produce of the interior to reach tse coa Of all knowu means of conveyance, the cheapest is conveyanceby water; and raiways, even when nade, cannot supersede tho necessity of navigating the grea: rivers whclh will stfU remain the great arteries of comrmerce, s has been found. to be the cae in America, and where experience bas shown that railways sndl river conTeyanoe assist instead of oppoSiDng one another. The rivers of India are of t extent; they flow through the bichest parta of thecountry; and they only require that vewsels should be established upon tltem whbir shal be capable of carrying a large cargo on a light draugbt of water to ensure results moreremunerative than isusual in commercialunxdertakingL

I accept that invitation In the conviction that my political opionion amO three of a large majority of the electors. and because Ifeel the force of the desir so generally expressed, that the commaercia interets of this great community should berepresented in Parliament by those whose life has been Paesed and whose occupations are still centred uLmong yoareelves, in the pursulto of commerce.

GnlmnToteEETRofF SUY. ,
FTER noh cosideration, I have come to the resolutin nt t apearbefore you assa candidate for the representationof te Broug ofFiosbury at the ensuinig election. In the satici. potion(whic I sh redith meet) thLat the present Parliament would havecontnue thrughthis session, I had hoped to perform the duties devovinguponme a yoreroprseutative, with the esergy of renewed healh ae wit theinc eafedeiciency acquired by my short experleno~ nd,eve intheevent of a new election, Were I so fortunate as to etinyop cnfdece,I holdhave indulge the sae hope in conAna Unexpected. defeat ha,however. tinduced Her Majestys Mlnisters to resolve on a Suddendsouin of PaErliament; and at the eame time I Aind that ancther candidate offers himself for your suifrages. Prom my knOwledge of that gentleman's ulfctosdeid from an acquaintance with his efforts and poalifctionsIn another snd a far more limited sphere than tha P-to which henowhe
asie,and from the maultitude of t-estimaonials I have recently receive of the kind esteem aod continued confidence of my friends, I should not for a moment have hesitated to place mysef in comPetitionk with him; nor could 1 have for one moment doubted the result. But, acontestonceebegun, Ihad reasonto believethat,ethers Offering far nifferent claims to Your support, would have been attrate
to the arena, and I might be cemamutted to a strife, to the toll and excitement of which my health and strength are qunite unequal. The expetience of one contest which, by Your kindness and favour, was rendered a triumpbant success convinces me that I dare not under. take it. I cannot, however, help the expression of my surprise and mnortification on perceiving that Major Rteed has thought hiessoll justi:fied, by a few undecided words which passed between us in a private con1versation, to maske a puiblic announcement of my Intenlinto retire fron the representation of the berough, ateonw ich I a zDot resolved at the timue of my communication awit that whuiehmIn and which I had not cert,Atljy authorized him to pablish.
In the discharge of my duties as your reprsesstative durn h
present Parliamnent, I have faithfauly adheredcto ths grn pr tcpes oDn which I solicited and received your support. I have on every occasotn given my vote in support of Parliamentary Reform by an exten-
sin of the suifrage and by the vote by ballot. I h.ve ever sought to vuphold and support the principles o1 civil and religious ireedeni. I have consistently0 O=Posed the ensdowment of bMaynooth. The welfare of all classes, eapcslIt the labouring elsaaes of the people, Is, in my judgment, closely connected with the preservation of a weekly day of rest. I have, therefore, invariable opposedany propssIltolegalI.e the desecration of tho Chiristian Sabbath on the plea of providing amuse-

?Mdlis'heswhiCh Yet dIsfigure ouir electoral system, and the steady and regular develspment of that political liberty for which we have as yet only prepared the way, foremost among which I place vote by ballot and a large exten8oion f the franchise.
X think that the fearful errors which have been committed in all do. yartmunte of our Administratlos, the abipw-reck: of the oldest secula -tins deontrae,Inthe clearest manner, the urgent necessity fra well-considered hut eweeping measure of Admninisorative reform carried Into every section of our Government departments, but more especaiuLy those which have shown themselves hopelessy tainted with the sin of lavish exiravagance, glaring Incapacity, and the grossedt nepotism.
I need haraly say that I stouild not venlture to solicit Your eudrages were I not in tee fullest msexe an advocate for the freeset and most sun. fettered development of the great principles of Free Trade. which have receved so brilliant a confirmation, &an which have principally contribute to maintain our commaercial position as first amo=g the nations of_5he earth.
I hae dvotd alare sare of time end attention to the study of

NEo an would.I feel euro, dare to appeal to the electors of Lambeth who had not nalled to the mast the standard of reigious liberty; I in therefore opposed on principle to every form of rant of public money for religious purpoees. and should eaerestly advocate an iminediate

on theIvexed questions of our foreign relations, I most vehemently condemn the anti-national polcly of te unnatura coaltion which has recny disgaed ouregiature-a policy Idemtical with that which
eceived the Russians ito a beief of our weaknes, and led to the disastrous contest fromQ which It cost us so heavy an expenditure of blood and treasure bonourably to emierge.

Genetlew5,
ADissolution haisben rather more bastily resolved Aon. Intenmldstof the nesionandaesasn than lum,humble opinion thereallntereseof the courtry required. Aa,bhowever. Itook no part whatever in isgseupposed cause, It is not perhap- for sue to offer ophinons on the subject.
But a few bhief exprewlotnefromn on e or two of the most distinguished supporters of Goferunrent may posibly bB alluded to. Illustrative 0f the extrmork~nsry eivmretlea Of opinonL on this mee~t vexed question. The Right,on. Edwrard EUllce, addressng his os,s~titueuts, asYs that he does " not apDrove and sincerely laments" the extra me mnea.ures resorted to in China,; that reprisals should LA the first instance have been taken, and the ulterior course reserved for the determination of *tho Government in England: that the ,eueAtlon of general hoetlilties should have beeni meerved for higher as-thorlty It would seem (he says) ful time that tbis practlce of involvinge the ceautry in wara in the Eat,except under the pressing necesirtIes of self-defence, shoald be brought more diretly under the control of Parliaioent."
And who is Mr. RUoe, who gives these formidable reawson against his own vote? Undoubtedly one of the ablest, muot useful, and I would almost add, most ilustrious of the Wlvg party-an ex-WbAg Miniser.
But, however I ay admire him, you know very well that I have n'~t the hOnoear of being Considered a Whig, and that I am certainly neither an ex nor a future AMinister.
Again, Sir WHilamx Clay, also on this occasion on* the side of Ministers, sys to hrs immenre constituency, whioh he so ably reproseats:-" Tho question whence has ari'en the suppoEed njecessity for as disslution was one of the moat dreflcult X hiave ever knaown submitted to the decison of the House of Commons.. one on which it was imarelble to give any vote witbout anxiety and doubt."
lint slug myself imprewsed with a stroog feeling on the matter, believing that a mistaken opinion had arisen upon It, what must my doubts and perplexities have beena-earnestly urged, as I eventually was, by three sete of old and 'valued friends, of veheacertly different views-the one requesting noy aporoval, the 'ither my disapproval. of the Cbinese pieceediugs-the third party that I should abstain altogether from interfering on mu questionable ani affair ? I had siready reslved on the latter couree; thus. at least, avoiding a violittion of mny own convictions, and I shal never regret having done so.
But two things must now inevitably be done-the lives and properties of Beitish and foreign mnerchiants must he pliced in security-the pretige and ascendeney orthe British armsertatord orestabli.shed. It is most satisfactor therefore to hear that a superior Government authority and some six thousand troops are about to be despatebed to the soeneofosoodifct. Had this beenaun~ur-ced during tbee snaes, or better still, two monthm ago, when the first intelligence of tslis affsir airrived we might have beenk spared a premature dolusition and an enormous quantity of oratory.
It Is true that on my last return from the field my health was much shattered. I was emabled, nevertheless, in that ession, while the war still continued, repeatedly to take as vigorous and efficent a part as any other man in Parliament (rerhan' more go) in promsoting the great ationl objct ofthat eriod th enocment bysall possible

I 1 claimn for every manu the eight of private judgment, and of exemption from 3at paIns penalties, and disabilities in the Connscientrous exercise of that rlghL.
I am a sftrenuous advocate for purity of election and I rejoice in be. loving that on that subject your views are equally decided.
I1 advocate the strIctest economory in the national expenditer whioh Is compatible with the due efficiency of the various departments of the public service. l believethat judicious retrenchment maybe applied espcal to the superilnous expenses of our naval and nilitary establIhents without imparing that effective strength of either which is not less essntial to the maintenance of the honour and security, or the nation than to the preservation of peace by due preparutlon for the sad alternative of war.
It has been my endeavour as a private eitizen to elevate the position of the industrious labourer to mainister to the privations of the deserving and necessitoas, ana to promote the usefulness of our local Institutions.
I have viewed with regret and anxiety that estrangement of classes in the econiomy of modern society, which too often has its origin in a neglect of those duties of kindly neighbourhood, in the discharge of which is bound up the safety of the rch and the elevation and onus. fort of the poor. It will be my endeavour if elected to Impress upo the Legislture the spiri which has dictated there viewe of social obi
tion, and to the best of my ability to serve you dilgently, and to eg.islate with a sing(le eye to the true interest of our common country.
As1 have no personal Interest to.ame. and no unworthy ambition to gratify, in responding to your requisition, it will be my endeavour so to repressut you asto justify_your confidence. A retired British merchant, and one of yourselTes, Ishball esteem It no less an honour than a duty faithfully to discharge the high trest should your choice devolve upon me. Ior am, Gentlemen,

THE STATE OF CHINA.
tz SI J.- B0WRDNG.
The. following letter, addressed to the RegiatrarGeneral, London, by Sir John Bowring, has been published iutheJournlac of the Statistical Society:-
"Govenrenmdt house, Hongkcong, July 13, 1855.
Sir,-I wish it were possible to give 1 satisfactory reply to your inquries as to the real population of China.
There has been no offidal census taken since the time of ia" ing, 43 years ago. lIuch doubt has been tbrown upon the accuracy of these returnsl, which gave 362,447,18 *s the total number of the inhabitants of
a. I think our greater knowledge of the country increases the evidenco in favoar of the approximate correctIeEB of the official document, and that we may with tolerablesafety estimate the present population of the Chinese empre as beten 350,000,000 and 400,000,000 of human
bemngs. The penal lawrsof Chinamake provisonfor a general stem of registration; and corporal punishments, goneally amounting tol10 blows of the bamboo, are to be infficted on those who neglect tom the proper returns. Tbe machinery is confided to the elders of the district, and the census is required to be annually taken; but I have no
easoen to believe that the law is obeyed or the neglect of it punished.
" In the English translation of Father Alvares Semedo's Histo-y of China, published in London, A.D. 1655, is the followiing pas go:
*-' This ydon is so exceedingly populous that, having ived there 22 ears,I was in no less amazement at my coming away than in the beginning at the multitude of the people. Certainly the truth exceedeth all hsyperboles ; not only in the cities, towns, and public places, but also in the
ighw;ay there is as great a concourse as is usual in Europe on some great festivaL And if we will refer ourselves to the general register-book wherein onlv the common men hre eurolled, leaving out women, children, eunuchs, proessors of letters and arms, there re reckoned of them to be fifty-eight millions fifty-five thousmd one hundred and four score.' The minuteness of the enumeration would seem to show that the father quoted some official doou-
"Iforward herewith two tabular statementswhich Iha-ra copied from Dr. Williams's Mfiddte Kingdom, one of the best books on China. The firTt (No. 1) gives a list of the various estimates from A.4D, 1393 to 1812, with the authorities quoted. The second is a rearranged statement of oensus taken at different periods (No. 2).
" As there are few men in China more diligent or better instructed than Dr. Williams, I thought it desirable to communicate with him in order to scertain his present views as to the credit which may properly be attached to She official statistics of China I send a copy of his letter (No. 3).
" I do not know that there is any safer course than to reason from details to generals, from the known to tho unknown; and I have taken every opportunity which my intercourse with the Chinese has afforJed me, to obtain, if not correct, at least approximative, information as to the true statistics of the country. It may be affirmed without any hesitation that, as regards the Five Ports and the adjacent districts to which we have access, the population is so numerous as to furnish argaments that the number of inhabitants of the entire empire is very much greater than is represented by the officialireturne. These localities cannot be taken as fair aveirges; for, naturally enough, increased commercial activity has brought with it a flow of new settlers, and there can be no doubt that some of the ancient seats of commerce have lost much of their population in losing their trade; but whether all the causes of decline in particular spots have much counteracted the fecundity of the Chinese races, considered as a whole, may well be questioned.
"' Some years ago I had an opportunity of discussing the subject of Chinese population with the mandarin at Ningpo, who was charged with making the returns for that district. Ningpo can scarcely be called a progressive place-it is decidedly the least so of the five treaty ports; but I found, generally speaking, that the real returns were considerably in excess of the offcial estimates.
" And I would remark that, in taking the area of the 18 provinces of China at 1,348,870 square miles, the census of 1812 would give 268 persons to a square mile, which is considerably less than the population of the densely peopled countries of Europe.
" According to ancient usage the population in China is groupedunderfourheads,-1, Scholars; 2, llusbandmen; 3, Mlechanics; 4, Merchants There is a numerous class who are considered almost as social outcasts, such as stageplaers-professionalgamblers-beggars-convicts-outlaws,
dothers; and these probably form no part of the population returns. In the more remote rural districts, on the other hand, the returning officer most probably contents hinself with giving the average of more accessible and better peopled localities.
" I have no means of obtaining any satisfactory tables to ehow the proportions which different ages bear to one another in China, or the average mortality at different periods of hum&u life; yet to every decade of life the Chinese apply swme special designation:-the age of 10 is called 'the OpeningDegree; 20, 'Youth Expired;' 30 'Strength and Miarriage;' 40, 'OfficiaUy Apt;' 50, 'Error-knowing;' 60, 'Cycle-closing;' 70, 'Rare Bird of Age ;' 80, 'Rusty-visaged ;' 90, 'Delayed;' 100, " Age's Extremity.' Among the Chinese the amount of reverence grows with the number of years I made, some years ago, the acquaintance of a Buddhist priest living in the convent of Tuen Tung, near Ningpo, who was more than a century old, and whom people of rank were in the habit of visiting, in order to show their respect and to obtain his autograph. He had the cvility to give me a fair specimen of his handvriting. There are not only many establishments for the reception of the aged, but the penal code provides severe punishments for those who refuse to relievo the poor m their dechning years. Age may also be pleaded in extennation of cnme and in mitigation of punishment. Imperal decrees sometimes order presents to be given to all indigent old people in the empire. I am not aware of any detailed statistics giving the number of auch recipients since a return published in the time of Ksnghi (1657). Kienlung (1785)
irected that all those claimants whose age exceeded 60 should receive 5 bushels of rice and a piece of linen; those above 80, 10 bushels of rice and two pieces of linen; those above 90, 30 bushels of rice and two pieces of common silkl; and those above 100, 50 bushels of rice and two pieces, one of fine and one of common silk. He ordered all the elders to he enumerated who were at the head of five generations, of whom there were 192, and, 'in gratitude to heaven,' summoned 3,000 of the oldest men of the empire to receive Imperial presents which consisted principally of embroidered purses, and badges bearing the character shau, meaning 'longevity.'
" The Kanghi tables show the numbers of those who enjoyed the benefit of the edict; but as the returns bear no proportion to the general population of the country or to the relative extent of the various provinces, many 'fortuitous and local circumstances must have caused the obvious incongruities For example, in theadjacentprovincesof Kwangtung and Kwangse, in which the whole mass of population is in the proportion of two to one, the recipients are as 46 to 1 ai nd as regards age, while the proportion of those above 80 is represented at 19 to 1, those above 90 are only a little more than 6 to L In all these matters the greater or less co-operation of the local authorities is one of the most important elements in producing a result. Kwangse is extremely mountainous and bordered on the north-west by the country of the hdeaou-tsz, or aborigines, the districts adjoining which are but in a half-reclaimed state, and governed by officers of a #-lharacte-r and denomination distinct from those of the provinces. But it is inexplicable that the province of Pechile, in which Pekin is situated, should exhibit but a smal
proportional return, especially as compared with the adjacent province of Shantung. Hookwang, with a populatitn of 26,250,000, bas 37,354 indigent nersons above 70, vhbile Szechuen, the population of which is 21,500,000, presents only 176 persons in that category.
" I thimk there is abundant evidence of redundant population pressing more and more heavily upon, and suffering more and more severely from, an inadequate supply of food. Though there are periods when extraordinary harvests enable the Chinese to transport rice, the principal food of the people, from one province to another, and sometimes even to foreign countries, yet of late the importations from foreign countries have been enormous, and China has drawn largely on the Straits, the Philippines, Siam, and other places, to fill up a vast deficiency in supply. Famine has, notwithstanding, committed dreadful ravage, and the provisions of the Imperial granaries have been wholly inadeq;Qate to provide for the public wauts It is true that cultivationasbeen greatly interfered with by intestinal disorders, and that there has been much destruction by inundations, incendiarism, and other accidental or transitory causes - but witbout reference to these, I am disposed to beliee tniat there is a greater increase in the numbers of the population than in the homueproduction of food for their use. It must be remembered, too that while the race is thus augmenting, the causes which iead tothe destruction of food,-such as the overfowof rivers, fires, ravages of locusts, bad seasons, and other calamities-are to a great extent beyond the control of human prudence or human exertion. It would be difficult to show what new element could be introduced which would raise up the native supply of food beyond its present productiveness, considering that hand husbandry as given to cultivation more of a horticultural
thn an agricultural character.
" The constant fow of emigration from Chins, contrasted with the complete absence of emigration into China, is striking evidence of the redundancy of the population; for
hounh that emigration is almost wholly confined to two provinces, namely, K vantung and Pookien, representing t
fiether * popu4bgin of probably from 34,000,000 to w~~,uv, amdispsed o tink hat nun oenawo
3,000,000 than 2,0o0,000, from these provinces alone, are located in foreign countries. In the kingdom of Siam it is estimated that there are at leat 1,500,OOD Chinese, of which 200,000 are in the capital (BangkoJ). They crowd all the islands of the Indian Arcbipeloag,, In Java, we
know by a correct census there are 136,00. Cochin China teems with Chinese In this colony we are seldom without one, two, or three vessels taking Chinese emigrants to California and other places, Multitudes go to Australia, to the Philippines to the Sandwich Islands, to the western coast of Central ana Southern America; some have made their way lo British India. The emigration to the British West Indies has been considerale-to the Havannah greater stilL The annual avrivas in Singapore akre estimated at an average of 10,0 h, and 2,000 is the number that are sid annually to return. to ChinL ,
"1There is not only this enormous maritime emigration, but a considerable inland efflx of Chminese towArds Mantchouri and Thibet; and it my be added that thelarge and fertile islands of Formosa and Hainan bare been to a great extent won from the aborigines by successive inroads of Chinese settler Now, these ara all nales; there is not a woman to 10,000 men; hence, perhaps, the small socia -vlue of the female infant.

"Th9Le ulttudea of persons whs liro Xq 'e fsJseri in
China afford evidenceo not only that the land is cultivated to the rtest ponibleextent,but thatit i6 insufficient to supply the necesdties ofthe overflowing population for ag iulture i eld in high houour in China aSn the husiandman stands nsext in rank to the sage or literary man in the social lierarchy. It has been upposed thatnearly a tenth of the Mpolation derive their means of SUpport from fisherles. Hundreds and thouands of boats crowd the whole coast of China-sometimes acting in commninties, sosnetimes independent and isolated. Thero is no species of craft by which a fish can be inveigled which is noS practnse with success in China-every variety of net, from vast seines embracing miles, to the smaUest bandfilet in the care of a child. Fishing by night and fishing by day,-fishing in moonlight5by torchlight, an din utter daarkness,-fishing in boats of all sizes,-fishing by those who are stationary on the rock by the seaside, aud by those who are absent for weeks on the wildest of seas,- fishing by ormiorants,-fishinglydivers,-fishing with lines, with baskets, -by every imaginable decoy and device. Thero is no river which ig not staked to assist the fisherman in his craft. There is no lake, no pond, which is not crowded with fish. A piece of water is nearly as valuable as a field of fertile land. At daybreak every city is crowded with sellers of live fish, who carry their commodity in buckets of water, saing all they do not sell to be returned to the pond or kept for another day's service. And the lakes and ponds of China not only supply large provisions of fish-they produce conaiderable quantities of edible roots and seeds, which are largely consumed by the people. Among these the eseolent arum, the water-chestnut (scicpus tuberosus) and the lotus (n7dumbhum) Lre the most remarkable.
" The enormous river population of China, who live only in boats, who are born and educated, who miarry, rear their families, and die-who, in a word, begin and end their existence on the water, and never have or dream of any shelter other than the roof, and who seldom tread except on the deck or boards of their sampans-show to what an extent the land is crowded, and how inadequate it is to maintain the cunberers of the soiL In the city of Canton alone it is estimated that 300,000 persons dwell upon the surface of the river; the boats, sometimes 20 or 30 deep, cover somne miles, and have their wants supplied by ambulatory salesmen, who wend their way through every accessible passage Of this vast population some dwell in decorated river boatsusedforevery purpose of licenseandfestivity-fortheatres-foroncertso_forfeasts-forgambling- forlost-forsolitary andsocialrecreations; some craftareemployed in conveying goods and passengers, and are in a state of constant activity; others are moored, and their owners are engaged as servants or labourers on shore. Indeed, their pursaits are probably nearly as various as those of the land population. The immense variety of boats which are found an Chinese waters has never been adequately described. Some are of enormous size, and are used as magazines for salt or rice-others have all domestic acconmmodations, and are employed for the transfer of whole families, with aU their domestic attendants and accommodations, from one place to another,-some, called Ccntipedcs, from their being supposed to have 100 rowers, convey with extraordinary rapidity the snore valuable cargoes from tho inner warehouses to the foreign shipping in the ports-all these from the huge and cumbrous junks, which remind one of Noahs ark, and which represent the rude and coarso constructions of the remotest ages, to the fragile planks upon which a solitary leper hangs upon the outskirts of society-boats of every form and applied to every purpose-exhibit an incaleclable amount of population, which may be caUed amphibious, if not aquatic.
"Not only are land and water crowded with Chinese, but many dweeU on artificial islands which float upon the lakes -islands with gardens and houses raised upon the rafters which the occupiers have bound together, and on which they cultivate what is needful for the sunply of life's daily wants. They have their poultry and their vegetables for use, their flowers and their scrolls for ornament, their household gods for protection and worship.
" In all parts of Chinato which we have access wo find not only that every foot of ground is cultivated which is capable of producing anything, but that, from the value of land and the surplus of labour, cultivation is rather that of gardeners than of husbandmen. The sides of hills, in their natural declivity often unavailable, are, by a succession of artificial terraces, turned to profitable account. Every little bit of soil, though it be only a few feet in length and breadth, is turned to account; and not only is the surface of the land thus cared for, but every device is employed for the gathering together of every article that can serve for manure. Scavengers are constantly clearing the streets of the stercoraceous flth; the clocam are farmed by speculators in human ordures; the most populous places are often made offensive by the means taken to prevent the precious deposits from being lost. The fields in China have almost always large earthenware vesseLs for the reception of the contributions of the peasant or the traveller. You cannot enter any of their great cities without m?eting multitudes of men, women, and children conveying Lquid manure into the fields and gardens around. The stimulants to production areapplhed with most untiring industry. In this colonyof Efongkong I scarcely ever ride out without finding some little bit of ground either newly cultivated or clearing for cultivation.
Attention to the soil-not only to mako it productive, but as much productive as possible-is inculcated as a poLl. tical and social duty. One of the most admired sages of China (Yung-chin) says:-' Let there be no uncultivated spot in the country-no unemployed person in the city;' and the fourth maxim of the sacred edict of Kang-hi, which is required to be read through the empire on the 1st and 15th day of every moon, in the presence of all the officers of State, is to the folowing effect :-'Let husbandry occupy the principal place, and the culture of the mulberry-tree, so that there may be sufficient supply of food and clothing.' Shin Nung, the name of one of the most ancient and honoured of the Chinese Emperors, means 'the Divine Husbandman.'
"The arts of draining and irrigating-of preserving, pre. paring, anapplying manure in a great variety of shapes, of ferti g seeds, indeed, all the details of Chinese agriculture, are well deserving of note, and all display evidence of the inadequate proportion which the produce of the soil bears to the demands for the consumption of the people.*
" The Chinese, again, have no prejudice whatever as regards food; they eat anything and everything from which they can derive nutrition. Dogs, especially puppies, are habitually sold for food; and 1 have seen in the butchers' shops, large dogs skinned and hanging with their viscera by the side of pigs and goats. Even to rats andrmicethe Chinese have no objection-neither to the flesh of monkevs and snakes ; the sea slug is an aristocratical and costly delicacy which is never waanting, any more than the edible birds' nests, at a feast where honour is intended to be done tothe guests. Unhatched ducks and chickens are a favourite dish.
or do the early stages of putrefaction create any diFgust; rotten eggs are by no means condemned to perdition; fish is the more acceptable when it has a strong fragrance and flavour to give more gusto to the rice.
"As the food the Chinese eat is for the most part hard, coarse,andof littlecost, so their beverages are singularly economical. Drunkenness isa rare vice in China, and fermented spirits or strong drinks are seldom used. Tea may be said to be the national, the universal beverage; and thongh that employed by the mnltitude does not coEt moro tban from 3d. to 6d. per lb., an infusion of less costly leaves is commonly employed, especialy in localities remote from the tea districts. Both in eating and drinking the Chinese are temperate,and are satisfied with two daily meals-'the morning rice' at about 10 &m., and 'the evening rice' at 61p.m. The only repugnance I have observed in China is to the use of milk-an extraordinary prejudice, especially considering the Tartar influences which have boen long dominant in the land; but I never saw or heard of butter, cream, milk, or whey being introduced at any native Chinese table.
' While so many elements of vitality are in a state of activity for the reproduction and sustenance of the human race, there is probably no part of the world in which the harvests of mortality are more sweeping and destructive than in China roducing voids which require no ordinary applances to xl up. Multitudes perish abrolately from want of the means of existence-inundations destroy towns and villages and all their inhabitants ; it would not be easy to calculate the loss of life by the typhoons or hurricanes which visit the coasts of China, in which boats and junks are sometimes sacrificed by hundreds and by thousands. The late civil wars in China must have led to the loss of millions of lives. The sacrifices of human beings by executions alone are frightfuL At the moment at which I ,write it is believed that from 400 to 500 victims fall daily by the hands of the headsman in the province of Kwangtung alone. Reverence for life there is none, as life exists in superfluous abundance. A dead body is an object of so little concern that it is sometimes not thought worth while to remove it from the spot where it putrefies on the surfaco of the earth. Often have I seen a corpse under the table of gamblers; often have I trod over a putrid body at the threshold of a door. In many parts of China there are towers of brick or stone where toothless-principaUy female -chidren are thrown by their parents into a hole made in the side of the wall. There are various opinions as to the extent of infanticide in China, but that it isra common practice in many provinces admits of no dloubt. One of the most eloquent Chinese writers against infanticide, Kwei Chung Pn, professes to have been specially inspired by ' the God of literature ' to call upon the Chinese people to refrain from the inhumau practice, and declares that 'the God' had fiUed his house with honours, and given him literary descendents as the recompense for his exertions. Yet bis denumniations scarcely go further than to pronounce it wicked inthose to destroytheirfemalechildrenvwho have the means of bringing them vp ; and some of his arguments are strange enough:-'To destroydaughters,'he says, 'isto make war upon Heaven's harmony ' (in the equal number of the sexes); 't e,more daughters yoa drowin, the more daughters von
wL nave; and never was it known that the drowning of daughters led to the birth of sons.' He recommends babndonng children to their f&te 'on the wayside' as preferable to drowning them, and then says, ' There are instances of children so exposed having been nursed and reared by tigers.' 'Where should we have been,' he asks, ' ir ourandmothers and mothers had bin ther infancy t And he quotes two instances of tho punishment of mothers who bad destroyed their infants, one of wFhom had a blood-red serpent fastened to her thigh, and the other her fonr- e.xtremities turned into cow's feet,+- Father Ripa mentions that of abandoned

It isby no meang unusual to carry persons in a state of exhaustion a little distance from the cities, to give them a pOt of rice, and to leave them to perih of starvation when the little store is exhausted. Ile and death in China, be. Mond any other region, seem in a State of perpetual activity. lhe habits of the people, their traditions, the teachings of 4he ages-all give a wonderful impulse to the nrocreative affections. Achildlessperson iB deemed an unhappy, not to say a degraded, man The Chinese moralists set it down
a lawr that i a wife give no children to her husband sho s bound by every teo of duty to encourage and to patronize a concubine, through whom his name may be preserved, nd provision made that when he leaves the world honours ill be done to his manes. One of the most popular of Chinese wnters says, ' There are in the world wives who, never having borne boys, nor nourished girls, even when the husband has reached the age of 40, prohibit hi. bringing home a concubine or entertaining a handmaid for the purpose of continuing his pogterity -they look upon Zuch a person with jealous hatred and malignant ill-l. AlasI do you not know how fleet istime? Sttetch sa you may your months and your yehs, thoy fly like arrows; and when your husband's animal spirits and vigorous blood shall be exhausted,-then
indeed, he can never beget chDdren, and you, his wife, wilt have stopped the ancestral sacrifices, and you will have cut off his generation-then repentance, though you may exhibit it in A hundred ways, will indeed come too late-his mortal body will die-his property, which you, husband and wife, have sought to keep together, Will not descend to his chidren, but be fought for bv mul titudes of kindred and relations; and you will have injured not one person-not your husband only-but even yourself
for who shall take charge of your coffin and your tombs Who shall bury you or offer sacrifices? Alas I your orphaned sirit shall pmss nights in tears. It is sorrowful to think of. There are some wives who do control their jealousies, and allow their husbands to take concubines to thomselves; but thoy do so (ungenerously) s if they were drinking vnegar, and eating acids-they beat Bety.by way of scold-
gBelnda'-there is no peace in the innerhouse But I beseech you to att as a pIrudent and vituous woman.' If you have no children, provide with openness and honesty s concubinet for your husband. If he, bea him children, to you ho will owe that the arteries and veins, of his ancestra line are continued; his children will honour you as your mother, and wiJl not this comfort yon I Give not way to the malignant jealousy of a wicked woman I Prepare not a bitterness which you yourself must swanow.-,
GeneraUly, however, tho wife WlUingly coincides with the husband in introducing into the household any number of concubines whom he is ablo to mLintain, since she exercises over them an undoubted authority, and the child of a cnonubine is bound to pay higher respect to the first wife than to its own mother. The Chinese illustrate all tho
dometic relations byimiagery, and are wont to say that, as the husband is the sun, and the wife the moon, so tho oncubinets are the planets and the stars of the domestic
"And it has been often truly observed that, though the Chinese may be called sensualists1 there is no deificAtion of tho grosser sensualities such as is found in the classical pantheons, and in many of the oriental forms of faith. Tales of teaznmours of their god and heroes seldom figure in their historical books or traditional legends The dresses and external habits of the women in China are invariably nodest, and on the whole the social arrangements must be considered friendly to an augmentation of the human race. The domestic affections are strong. Parents are generaUy fond and proud of their children, and children obedient to their parents. Order is, indeed, the first law of Confuciusauthority and submission the apex and basis of the social pyramid.
" The sentiment of dishonour attached to the extinction of a raco by the want of descendants through whom tho vvhol
line of reverential services (which some have called religious worship) rendered to ancestors is to bo perpetual is by no means confined to the privileged classes m China. One of our female servants-a nominal Christian-expressed her earnest desire that her husband should have another Wife in her absence, and seemed quite surprised that any one should suppose such an arrangement to be in any respect unmproper.
" The marriage of children is one of the great concerns of amilies. Scarcely is a child born in the higher rauks of life ero thequestionof its futureespousalbecomes a frequent opic of discussion. There is a. large body of professional natchimakers, whEose business it is to put all the preliminary arrangements in train, to settle questions of dowry, to accommodate differences, to report on the pros and cons of suggested alliances There being no hereditary honours in China-except those which reckon upwards from the distinguished son to the father, the grandfather, and the whole line of ancestry, which may be ennobled by the literary or martial genius of a descendant-the distinctions of caste are unknown, and a successful student even of the lowest origin would be deemed a fit match for the most opulent and distinguisbedfemale inthecommunity Thesevere laws which prohibit marriages within certain degrees of affinity (they do notk however, interdict it with a deceased wife's sister) tend to make marriages more prolific, and to produce a healthierrace of children. So strong is the objection to the marriage of blood relations that a man and woman of tho same Sing or family namo cannot lawfully wed.
" Soldiers and sailors are in no respect prevented from marrying. I expect there is, from the number of male emigrants- rom the greater loss of men by the various accidents of life,Land their abstraction in many circumstances from intercourse with women-a great disproportion between the sexes, tending naturally enough to the lower appreciation of woman; hut correct Statistics are wanting in this, as indeed in every other part of the field of inquiry
The proporton of unmarried to married people is (as would be dednced from the foregoing observations) exceedingly I malL To promote marriages seems everybody's
nair. Matches and betrothings naturally enough occupy the attention of the young, but not less that of the middleaged and the old. A marriage is the great event in the life or man or woman, and in China is associated with more of preliminary negotiations, ceremonials at different steps of the negotiations, written correspondence, visitings, protocols, and conventions, than in any other part of the world."

TIME MURDER OF MRS. SARAH KELLY.
The memory of this almost forgotten butchery was revived at the close of the Westmeath Assizes yesterday, when application was made to Chief Justice Monahan on behalf of Mr. George Strevens to discharge him fromn his recognizance, into which he entered last assizes, to attend at the present assizes to answer the charge of having been concerned in the murder of Mrs. Sarah Kelly on the 5th of April 1856 No bill had been found, and nuder the liabeas Corpus Act Mr. Strevens was entitled to his discharge after two assizes, unless good reason were shown upon affidavit. The motion was opposed on the ground that the Habeas Corpus Act did not apply to a case of bail; and the Chief Justice said he was of opinion that he ought not to interfere in this case. He would therefore lease Mr. Strevens to apply to $he Court of Queen's Bench, if he thought fit so to do. He abstained advisedly from stating his reason, but, knowing the nature of the case and the difficulty on the part of the Crown of obtaining information, he was of opinion that he shouald not interfere. It might be different if the party were in custody, but the gentleman was not t custody, and he could only say that he would not advise him to surrender and go to prison, as possibly, if he did, he might feel it to be his duty to keep him there.

ECCLESIASTICAL CORPOR&TION BILL.
The Marquis of BLANDFORD, in moving that the order for the second reading of this bill be discharged, wished to say a few words with reference to the objects of the measuro His great aim in this and similar Bills which he had in. troduced to the House was to secure an adequate provision for the paroohial wants of tho country. Parliament had on various occasions directed Its attention to this subject, and he could conceive none of greater imuportance to the conntry. Withoat claiming anything exelusive for the established church, it was impossible not to recognize the fact that the established church was the great engine, the mechanism by which the vital truths of the Christian religion were propagted and supported in this country, and they could not, therefore, exaggerate the importance of making adequate provision for the maintenance of z e paroch'ial system. In order to make an adequate provision for that system endowments were required, and it was to promote that object that he had on various occasions introduced meaures to the House. The common fund of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had been created from time to time, by Acts passed for the purpose, from the property of ecclesiastical corporations aggregate and sole; and, follow. ing out that object, the present Bill, which had a double purpose, had been introduced. One of its objects was to transfer the property of ecclesiastical corporations to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and the second was that when that property bad been so transferred the commissioners should have the power to make the ulterior arrangements to which it should be subjected. If that transfer could be facilitated means would belfound for promoting,a very large increase of funds for parochial purposes. Cossiderable objections were entertained to that part of the proposal which would leave the management of estates in the hands of the Eccleslastical Commissioners; but provided the first important step of the transference to the commissioners could be gained he would be willing, as far as possible, to meet the views of those who objected to leaving the management of the estates in their hands. If by any modification of this part of the Bil a satisfactory conclusion could be arrived at upon the question he would consider himself amply rewarded. In conclusion he moved that the order for the second reading of the Bill be discharged.
MIr. B. DENISON reminded the noble lord that a committee sat last year to inquire into the system of management of the estates pursued by the Ecclesiastical Commistioners and he believed that it would be necessary to introduce a Bill on the subject of the Ecclesiastical Commission. Be put it to the noble lord, therefore, whether it would not be necessary that that Bill should be carried before they could come to any aatisfactory conclusion as to transferring further estates to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. (Hear, hear.)
hrr. WALPOLE agreed with his hon. friend who had just spoken. The committee of last year made several important recommendations affecting the Ecclesiastical Commissioners and the manva-ement of the estates, andhe thought the House ought to seeAhow far the Government was prepared to carry out those recommendations by the introduction of a BiU before they adopted the proposition of his noble friend. (Hear.) The Bill of his noble friend embraced I two points-one the transfer of the estates of ecclesiasticalcorporations totheEcclesiastical Commissioners, and the other to vest these estates in the hands of the commhisioners without a retransfer to episcopal and capitular bodies of those properties which Parliament had already sanctioned for their use. All the evidence taken before the committee showed the disadvantage of a compulsory transfer, and the great superiority of a voluntary system of transfer. Already five or six chapters had made transfers voluntarily, and others were preparing to foUow, so that the expediency of this Part of the Bill might be strongly questioned. He would press upon his noble friend not to throw too much upon the Ecclesiastical Commissioners at once, before they could have power properly to regulate the property committed to their charge. He found from the Ninth Report of the Church Estte Commissioners that between 1851 and 1856 the transactions in which they were engaged were 827 in number, and that the value of the estates connected with these transactions was 3,300 000L In 1855 the number of transactions were 225, ana the value of the fee of the estates not less than 900,0001. The aggregate number of transactions was 1,0S2, and the value of the property concerned 4,200,0001. He could never agree to a proposal for vesting the estates of bishops aud chapters in the commissioners without a retransfer of those estates which Parliament had already appropriated for the support of those charters. He thought that bishops and chapters should have the power of employing the Ecclesiastical Commissioners and their agents in the management of their estates, in order that all these purely secular matters might be withdravn from their consideration. Considering the vast extent of the real property belonging to the Church of England, and considering that they could have all the advantage of management without placing the whole property of that church under one metropolitan board, he
oped his noble friend would pause before he pressed such a acheme upon the consideration of the House.
The order was then discharged.
IMPIRISONh,ENT FOR DEBT BILL.
Mr. PELLATT moved the second reading of this Bill, the object of which was to relieve from the punishment of imprisonment persons who became involved in debt through misforttme or from unavoidable causes.
Sir G-. GREY said it wras quite hopeless to expect that the Bill could pass during the present session, and he thought therefore tt w as most inex;pedient to go into a debate wvhich could have no practical result.
Mlr. COBB E:TT expressed his approval of the principle of
After a few words from 31r. WHerrswI,
The second reading was negatived without a division.
GRAND JURIES (IRELAND) BILL.
On the motion of Colonel GunV1Lnn the order of the day for the second reading of this Bill was discharged.
SUPPLY.
The House then went into Committee of Supply, Mr. Fitzroy in the chair.
A vote for discharging Exchequer-bills was agreed to.
On the vote of 1,553,2001. on account to defray the charge of certain civil services to the 31st of March, 1858,
Sir J. PAKINGTON said,-I am not quite clearwhether lam right in apprehending that the vote on account for education is included in this sum. If that is the case, I am desirous of maklng a few remarks in consequence of what fell, in my absence, from my right hon. friend the member for the University of Oxford, in his address on the expenditure of tho country Lat night. Iunderstand that he expressed very considerable dislike of the growing amount of these annual votes for the purposes of education. Tow, perbhps, it might be some surprise to that right hon. gentleman if he were prseent, and it may be a surprise to many of those who hear me, vhen I say that I entirely concur in the opinonhe expressed, and, if a discussion had taken place upon the Bill which I introduced it was certainly msy inten. tion tc state my very strong objection to the growing anount of these annual votes for education, and mor, especially with respect to the manner in which they are applied. It was truly said last night that this is a very popular question, and it is considered a very popular thing for the House of Commons to vote large sums for education. In some respects, no doubt, that is a very desirable course It is a course very acceptable to many hon. gentlemen in this House, because it affords a very easy retreat from the difficulties of the subject, and it is very satisfactory to those -who I believe are more numerous than they profess to bhwho do not wish to see any progress in the education of the people. But I hold that the House of Commons has a duty beyond that of voting large sums for any object, Ihowever desirable in itself. It is our duty to take care that when thee sums are granted they are wisely and benefidally expended. 5Hear, ihear.) If I have the
tonour of a seat in the next Marliarment, when these ,rant.
comeundr te cnsieraionof he oweO, I think I shall be able to show thiat these annual and growing grants for educationL involve a wasteful and extravagant expenditure of public money, without any adequate benetit to the country. I should, therefore, have been prepared, had I been in Tny place lst nght, to exPress, to that extent, my concurrenc in the views of the right hon. mnember for the
snovteto of fOormd. fliIgm correctlY inf Ormed with reIseeryw l tatffrommy rthInv thon friend lunderstand that lie went on to my that whle he would check these annual grants by Parliament he would not provide any equivao lent In pabn other way, but that e -would trust the education o the anPele solely and exclusively to voltm. tary exertions. Now, to any such Ian as that, from, whatever quarter it migt proced,I shiould entertan the
greate objection, and I wish to take this opportlnity of I stating that I cannot protest in terms to-o strong oar too ema. phatic against a cours which, in mY humble judgmenit, would be an abandonment of one of the first duties of this House, and a neglect of the highest interests of the people'
The House may depend upon it that what was stated by the. right hon. gtU.u entleman is perfectly true-namely, that, as the* Maae fCuncil tow Oxists, thes grants, large as they we, wMdl goont graduaUll increasIng - and I believe tho timeo Is not very distant when-they wil amount to a, Mmilon, instead of half;&-million A.s at present. I trust I may sue. ceem hereafter in convincing the House that if they are pledged to thee greatB and I g they are no less
pledged by public duty and prudence to take far greater
securities than any we0nowposseassto Insurews,puet ancd beneficial expenditure 'of such considealsus
deeply regret that ths~course of public affaish&sprene me from raising the discsson. Ihdhpdwudhv taken PI'av upon the Bill which I itope.Udrpe
sent circumstances it is imposible t prceed with,that Bill but I wll express my earnest and sanguine bQpe that the aiscussions which have taken place on this subject ins the present Parliament will not be without their fruits, and thit the Parliament about to assemble will be prepare4 to bestow that earnest said anxious attention upon this iimpoitaut question to wvhiob, from its bearing upon the interests . and wielfare of tho people, it is eminently entitled. (Cheegs.)
Sir G. GREY.-I fully agree with the right hon. baronet that this subject is one which cannot be adequately and properly discussed at the present time; and I regret therefore that he has taken this opportunity of expressing so decided and so unfavourable an opinion with regard to that system which has hitherto received the sanction of Parlament, under which, from the grants placed at the disposal of the Executive Government, extensive and useful assistance is afforded to existing schools, without anyinterference in the management of such schools, or with the religious creeds taught in them. The real question at issue between the right hon. gentleman, and I may almost say-jadging from the expression of opinion last session-the majority of this House, is whether the system of assisting existing schools by grants placed by Parliament at the disposal of the Executive Governmient should be continued, or whether a general nationalsystem of education, s pported by local taxation, or by othermeans, shoaldbeestablished. Ihaveonformer occasions expressed my sense of the valuable exertions of the right hon. baronet in the cause of education, but I think, judging from the feeling expressed in the country and in this House, Her Majesty's Government would not have acted wisely 'or judiciously in propsing to Parliament, during the present session, anyBill for the establishment of what is called a general system of national education, superseding the system now in force. In the Bili which the right hon. baronet intimates his intention of proposing to the next Parliament-
Sir J. PAXINGTONL-No; I did not express such an intention.
Sir G. GREY.-Well, the right hon. gentleman propes to bring the subject under the consideration of the House next session, and we shall then have to decide between the two systems. I differ from him in thinking that the Parliamentary grants have been administered in a mauner which has not tended to promote education. I beheve they have given a great stimnulus to education throughout the country, and that it can be demonstrated that very great advantage has resulted from the system at present in operation. I hop,e that in the next Parliament there willIbe a general desire to promote the extension of education, whatever difference of opinion may exist as to the means to be employed for that purpose.
Mr. HENLEY expressed his cononrrence in the observations of the right hon. Home Secretary. Although he admitted Parliament should take care that the country, to use a common p hrase, should have its sixpennyworth for its sixpence (" Hear, hear," and a laugh), he believed the Parliamentary grants had acted as a strong stimulus to education, and he did not think there had been any abuse in their administration. It seemed Impossible, owing to the religious differences that prevailed, to establish any general system of education whic4 would not be confned to secular teaching; but the great advantage of the present st'stem was that it afforded assistance to persons of all regious creeds to train up childr in their own tenets. He would always oppose any measure which tended to endanger that principle.
Mr. E. DENISON agreed with the right hon. member for Droitwich, that it would be one of the first duties of the new Parliament to consider the question of education, which excited profound interest throughout the country. Concurring with the Home Secretary that they must look rather to the extension audimprovement of the existing system than to the establishment of anygeneral and comprehensive scheme of education, he thought the Government ought to take an eaTly opportunity of explaining to the next Parliament their views and intentions on the subject, in order that Parliament might know, beforo various measures were subnitted to them, what couzso the Government intended themselves to pursue.
Mfr. W. E WART areed with the right hon. baronet (Sir G. Grey) that the present system of grants afforded a stimulus to education, but he regarded that system as a temporary expedient which could not be long continued. He believed they would nltimately have to adopt a system of education similar to that vwhich existed in the United States and in Scotlaud-namely, a national system, supported by voluntary rates. (Hear, hear.) He would suggest to the Govern ment whether, without in any degree interfering with the existing scheme, they might not, by a short Bill, establish an educational test by requiring that a certificate of pro. gress in educatton should be obtained from a proper authority before children under a certain age were auowed to be employed in labour.
Sir 3. PAINGTON wished to explain that he had not intended to imply for a moment that the annual grants had not tended to a great extent to promote education. It would be presumptuous in any one to assume that he wouli be sure to be returned to the next Parlament. He hoped, howvever, that in the next ParLanient the subject would receive early attention.
Mr. A. PELLATT preferred, on pecuniary considerations, the present system of Parliamentary grants, increasing about 10,001. a-year, to the plan of the nght hon. gentleman the member for Droitwich.
Sir H. WILLOUGHBY suggested that the right hon. gentleman (Sir J. Pakington) should consider the amount of charge upon the local rates, and the difficulty of distributing the money so raised.
Mr. WILSON, in reply to the previous speaker, said the priciple by which the Government were guided in these votes on amount was to ask only for money absolutely necessary for the public service in the next three months,
Mr. SPOONER asked whether any expenditurc con. nected with the Kensington Gore estate was included in the vote.
Mr. WILSON said the Government had followed the rule of not introducing anythingnew into the estimates upon which votes on account were taken. There was no sunm included connected with the Kensington Gore estate.
The vote was then agreed to.
Upon a vote of 1,510,003L on account of the Revenus Department,
Sir H. WILLOUGHBY remarked upon the increase of salaries, which, though small in detail, amounted to 15,0004. in the aggregate.
Mr. WILSON said they must make up their minds to a gradual and considerable annual increase in the Customs' Department. The shipping having doubled in 10 years the services of a greater number of officers were required, and by recent regulations the officers In all the departments receved salaries upon arising scale which necessaril caused an increase of expense. When it was remembered that in three years 1,700 rural pest-offices had been established, in order to give greatr facilities to the public, he did not think the extra expense of the Post-office Department would be grudged.
The vote was then agreed to.
INCOME-TAX BILL.
On the order of the day for the consideration of this Bill beuig read,
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEcQUER said lie wished to give an explanation as to what passed last evening with respect to the supposed inadvertent omission of the word "property." He stated at the time his opinion that the Bill as drawn was sufficient, but he did not object to the introduction of the word, sad, accordingly, the Bill was recommitted, and the word " property' introduced. He had since referred to the Chairman of Inland Revenue and the solicitor of that department, and they assured him that the Bill was drawn with perfect correctness, that the income-tax was not charged on property, but on rents issuing out of property, that in the lAnguage of the law rents were called " profits," and, therefore, that the words " profits and gains" as in the Act of 1853 were amply sufficient. He thought it right to give the explanation in order to satisfy the House that there had been no want of care in the preparation of the Bill. The word " property" was quite innoctuous. It did not in any way alter the sense, and the Bill would stand as amended. There was another point which he wished to explain. The right hon. gentleman the member for the University of Oxford made some remarks last night with reference to the succession duty, stating there was ddicultv in collecting it in consequenoe of the want of adequate strength in the department. He was aware that measures had been taken to remedy the evil of which the right hon. gentleman complained, but he did not like to give an answer without reference to documents, lestklis explanation should be imperfect. He could now stato exactly what had taken place. A short time ago Mr. Pressly, chairman of the board of inland revenue, complained of want of strength in the legacy branch of his office, and he told that gentleman
he would receive authority to increase the stAff on application to the Treasury if such an increase were shown to be necessary. The commissioners of inland revenue on the 28th of Febr.^n^ry made a report, setting forth the circumstances of the c*ase, and recominandingv certain additions. They said,-" Having conferred with the
controller of lesacy duties oii the whole sabject, we have natisfied ourselves that, for the combined objects referred to in this report it will be necessary to increase the Succession and Legacy Duty Department, and this increase is not more than the circumstances fully justfy." They recommended the addition of one exammer, with a salary of 3201., rising by 101. a-year to 3704* three assistint examiners, with saaries of 2504 a-year, rising to 3001; one clerk, with a salary of 150. a-year, rising to 2001; and four clerks with salaries of 901 a-year, rising to 140L The report was received on the 2d of March, ad on the 4th of March the Treasurry athorized the additions to be made. Most of the appointments had already been sanctioned, and Mr. Pressly informed him that two rooms had been prepared at the Inland Revenue offico for the accommodation of these additional exminers and clerks. Ho believed he might aso add that any application made by the department for additional strength m the Legacy Duty branch would always be attended to by the Treasury, He thought this statement would satisfy the House there had been no remissness on the part of the Government in giving the department what was necessary for the collection of the succession duty. He might ad that there were cerain questions now pending before-the courts on which the collection of that duty t a certain extent depaended, and until those questions received Sudicla decision the collection of the duty must, to a. ;cerhain extent, be impeded.;
'Mr. IENIEY expressed a hope that pD the Income-tax ill the Chancollor of the Exchequer would continue the Phraselogy of the present law, as the, introduction of a new woring*ht lead ttosdeoutbt and difficuelty.ouffno

"In the month of October, when hostilities commenced at Canton, the missionsaies were goon obliged to take refuge either here or at MIacao. The Germans on the main land were also driven from their stations, and now we are al waiting anxiously to see the issue to which Providence will bring theso disastrous events. Things look very dark at present. The Chinese are for nothing but war, and they wil get it tll they em ore than satisfied,there is no doubt. The spirit of hatred to foreigners which prevails in this province is most bitter, and the exertions of missionaries for all these years that they have been labouring for the spiritual good of these people seem to have done almost nothing towarlds overcomnng it. We have been shut out from the countr7 by treaty stipulations, and the massl of the people are as ignorant of the real character and power of foreign nations as they were 50 yearsago-i.&,they look upon us as a race of barbarous freebooters, who come to their shores simply to make gain of them,-the peaceful and enlightened citi2ens of the only civilized country in the world. Tract distribution and missionary labours have told upon individuals. Small Christian societies have been formed, and the Gospel has asserted its power over the hearts of Chinese as well as over men of othernations; but the obstacles up to this time have been very great, even much greater than we who are living here had anticipated. The real feeling of the people is showing itself now as it never did before. Even inHongkong it isalmost useless to attempt missionary work at thepresent time. We need a double supply of that wisdom which isfrom Above; and the churches at home mnust pray for the poor benighted Chinese, and for us who are sent to them, with special earnestness at this crisis, that It may turn out to the glory of God and the furtherance of the Gospel."

"I write you a few lines, and forward you the Trat account, under greater feeling of adness and discouragement than I have ever written to the Parent Society before. Hostilities and trouble, long threatening, have at last come upon the Canton people in a severe manner, and but only just commencing. AProud sense of independence and a uniform discourteous bearing have brought them into collision with Her MaJesty's naval forces, and so great have been the consequences that large additions of troops arerequired from India or England before submision can be obtained and peace and order secured.
" All the foreign residences, except ave7 few in the suburban parts, have been wholl destro ed by fire A sare mount of prop has b lt, satisfaction for which wll greatly comp ceate the settlement of the question. In the meantime aU missonary operations at Canton are at a standstill, and it is impossible to say, with any certaint, when they can be resnmed.
"Up to the week when the mpture took lace between our authorities and the Chinese Government Mr. Cox and I were conducting in a very satisfactory manner a weekly
eeting, at which reports of the co&porteurs both of the Bible and Tract Soieties were heard, the amount of distribution, and everything Interesting connected with it recorded, always followed up with exhortation and prayer. This record of the week, month, and years labours Xr. Cor has with him, probably at SingaPOre, or the book ma;yhave been forgotten m the harry of leaving our houses, and left in Canton i but, though I cannot refer to it to give, as uLsual, statistical data of the work accomplished, yet the enclosed paper wTill show that 37,000 tracts were distributed up to the middle of October, which does-not include sheet tracts, or tracts or books provided for in other ways by lr. Pidiery and other members of the misson. Most of the blocks were, I am sorry to say, in the printer's hands within the city when these troubles suddenly and unexpectedly commenced. They will moat probably be taken care of by the printer, and returned to n3 at acme future day, unless destroyed by fire. It was uot possible to let the man know that we desired them back, as the manager fcaped among thefirst into thecountry, to be out ot danger of being seized from lilaconnexion with usY

India Stock left off at 221 to 223; Exchequer-bonds, 98i to :t; India Bonds, 3s. discount to par; and Exchequerbills, par to 3s. premium.
Thfe demand for money to-day was increased by the preparationrs for the purchase of the newly arrived Australian gold.
Foreign securities were dealt in only to a limited extent, but prices were rather firmer towards the close of business. In Turkish Six per Cents.. the transactions for the account were at 96i, g, and J. The Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account, were negotiated at 101 and 100I. The other operations comprised-Brazlian, for account, 102i; Mexican, for account, 22k and J; Peruvian, for account, 78k, i, and i; Sardinian Five per Cents., for account, 90X; Spanish New Deferred, for account, 24a, 1, and 25; Spanish Certificates, 6k; Dutch Two-and-a-Ealf per Cents., 65i and i; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 99.
The corn-market this morning was without aiteralion.
The closing quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 70f. 90c. for money and 71f. 30c. for the end of the month, showing an improvement of an eighth'
A fther sum of 40,0001. in gold was taken from the 4Ank to-day for exportation.
The Blackwall has arrived from Melbourne with S1,000 ounces of gold, valued at 324,0001. A large proportion of it is expected to be sent to the continent.
It appears that the proposition xientioned yesterday, of the local Govermnent of 4ictoria to establish a national bank of issue in that colony is likely to meet with powerful opposition from the body of persons intereated in the existing joint-stock banks. On the other hand, the scheme promises to be popular with the people at large, the majority of whom are easily led away by the fallacy that by taking the circulation into its own haands the Government ,would bring down the high rates of interest at prefent charged. The arguments for the principle of establishing a national bank with functions strictly limited, by which entire security would be given to the paper issues while the country at large would obtain the profits of them, may be generally admitted, but it would be an unjusifiable measure if the Government, after the existing institutions by their enterprise and good mnanagement have farniliarized the countrywith the advantages of a note currency, and established general confidence in its negotiability and valae, ,were suddenly and without compensation of any kind to, seek to seize the business that has thus been created. Yet, according to a description of the plan of the Colonial Treasurer, given by Mr. Westgarth in an address to the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce, something of this kind is contemplated. A certain day is to be named on which the banks at present issuing are to be obliged to confine their issues to the extent of t7reir then circulation. Another day is to be named on which they are to cease re-issuing any notes that may be paid in, and, finally, a day is to be notified when their notes shall sno. longer be receivable at the Treasury. The intervals at which these arrangements are contemplated do not seem yet to have been mentioned, but it is to be assumed that they are short. Mr. Westgarth, in the interest of the banks, denounces the proposition as an attack upon vested rights, and, within certain limits, his view is palpably correct. In England, when Sir Robert Peel resolved to interfere with the issuing powers of the private banks, he confined himself to restricting them to their then amount, and fixed ten years as the period before any steps could be taken for the extinction of their privileges. A similar grace should at least be accorded to establishments like bthose in Victoria, which have contended creditably with all the trials and risks of the most anxious epoch in the history of the colony. Should a less considerate course be pursued, it will probably prove less profitable than its originators imagine. The local Government announce that they are desirous of carrying on the principal railway and other works of' the colony by debenture loans, and the rate at -which these may be negotiable wil not be unaffected tby thc tone that may be manifested by the Legislature in dealing with existing rights, actual or implied.
it is understood with regard to the new International Bank about to be established in Paris, that the board of directors is to consist of 25 members. Of these 15 are to be French, 6 English, and 4 German. The French list is not yet completed, bat the names thus far selected are-MM. Vandal, Donon, Jayr, Montan6, Arles-Dufour, and Bisehoffsheim.
A meeting of the creditors of Messrs. C. Frangbiadi Sons, Greek merchants, who failed on the 20th of February, was held to-day, Mr. Diggles presiding, when the following statement was presented by :llr. J. E3. Coleman, the accountant:

There are three houses in addition to the London establishment,-one at Galatz (presumed to be solvent), a second at Alexandria, and a third at
rIeste. The house at Trieste has stopped, and the liabilities will be increased through this event -about 9;000., makdng a total of 126,0001. Against this amount the assets in London are taken at 15,5501., and at Tdeste at 3,5001., while Mr. Colemnan has thought itprudent, in consequence of
the Trieste house being creditors for` 32,0001 1 to take the Alexandria balance at 29,0001, instead of 61,2711., as it stands in the took.. In this ahape the accounts will show 48,0601. to meet 125,0001.; and if the house of Fran-
,hiadi and Yalenti, of Alexandria, is on a rsettlement liable for, or in a position to pay, a
reter amount, the excess wtill increase the general dividend. Since the London house stopped 6,8501. has been received, prinoipally from Alexandria, and thi, together with the 15,5001., makes 22,3001., which it is thought may be safely realized,-allowing a distribution,Mif the creditors concur, of 2 m. in the pound at no distant period. As some of the ,claimants have conmmeneedproceedingsinbankmuptcy it was suggested that it would be desirable to ascertaJin what steps thQy intend to pursue, and Mr. Lave, supported by the majority, explained that recourse to that tribunal will not improve the assets or facilitaf the adiiatrtion of the estate. A lo1g d on e% w with regard to the manner in wnich on 'or two transactions had been con'ducted, and the parties opposing said they could not. pledge theelves. to accede to the mode of liquidation suggested. In answrer to questions ib
a atMed that: the firm commen¢ed 7rwith a capital of 12,5oot, and that the losses and expenses lavrinOluWded from ,5 001M to 60'00W. 2410001; of which are t tgh FUioliuiea onlillN A bi

Franghiadi (Fianghiadi and Rodoeanichi), and Mr. LBzard-do form a committee, with aut ority either to select aomo competont person to go out to Alexandria, or to forward instructions to some house at Alexandria with a view to ascertain the true position of the firm there, and to obtain the remittance of funds to the commitee as quickly as possible. In the meantime the assets are to be realiaed, uder the direcion of the committee, with a view to an early dividend, and all funds to be deposited at the Bank of Englod in thXe joint names of Mr. G.

It is believed that the next Indian mail will take out about 600,0001. in silver.

IN RE THE ROYAL BRITISH BAYK.
(Before Mr. Commi*sion& HOLXOYD.--
This was a meeting for the examination of .Mr. Edward Esile, the Governor oF the Bank.
MIr. LuIMATER appeared for the assignees and exAmined Mr. Esdaile as follows :.-
What is your Christian name ?-Edward.
Where do you reside ?-At the present moment7
Yes.-I am residing now in London at my father's house at Bedford-place.
What is your present occupation ?-Nothing.
Were yoa formerly a director and also governor of the Royal British Bank ?-Yes.
When did you first become a director of that bank ?-I was on its provisional committee, and have been connected with itas £Mirector since.
When did you first become a director of the banklc-I think it was in the early part of 1849; the exact month I do not recollect-Jnuary or February, I dare say.
When did you become a governor of the baxk?-Tn February, 1855.
Did you continue to act as a director of the bank from the time it commenced business in 1849 down to its close in Sepember, 1856 ?-Yes.
You vrere at no period during that time out of the direc. tion i-No.
Then, did you continue governor from - ?-From Mr. Walton's retirement from the chair.
When w.S that?2-In February, 1855.
You continued governor down to the time of the closing of the bank7.-Yis.
When did the bank commence business7?-The latter part of 1849-October or November.
Was it on the 19th of November, 1849.?-Yes.
What was the amount of saubscribed capital with which the bank started?-50,0001.
Subscribed capital?-100,000L.
Be kdnd enough to pause a little before you answer the next queetion; how much of thatcapital waad up wheu the bank commenced busines 7.-50 OOO
Do I understand you to say thit the whole Hum of 50,0001. had been actually paid up in cash before the bank commenced business7.-Cash, or the representative of cash. Will you teU me how much had been paid up in cash?I do not exactly recollect within a few thousands, the balance being represented by notes of hand, which were deemed to be equivalent to cash.
That account produced is one that has been prepared by Mr. Coleman [handing an account to the witness]. Will you be kind enough to look at it to see whether its representation is correct, that the actual amount subscribed in cash up to the time when the bank commenced business was 42,7651. 6s. 5d., and no more ?-I believe that is the fact; I cannot say, but I believe it to be so.
Was the remainder of the 50,0002. made up of the promis. sory notes of the several debts named in that account7To the best of my belief. I was then a junior director and of course these things were m ged then by the governor, deputy-governor, general manager, and solicitor.
Were you aware that before commencing the businees of the bank the Act of Parliament required that the whole sum of 50,000l. should have been actually paid up?-Yes, in one wy or the other, essentially paid Up
Do I understand you to represent that you believe the directors bad complied with the requirements of the Act of Parliament ?-In spit.
But not in fact .?-Not in fact, if it is to be assunmed that the 50,0001. were intended to be in sovereigns or banknotes.
Wil you tell me how much cash the bank had actually at its disposal when it commenced business on the 19th of November, 1849?-I cannot charge myrecollection with the sum.
Just look at that (handing the book to the witness).-I have no doubt that is correct.
I umnderstand you to say that you have no doubt the bank. book is correct ?-I can have no doubt of that
Then, you mean that the cash actually standing to the credit of the bank in the Bank of England was 20,20., and no more ?-Yes ; I presume that is correct.
I observe that on the 20th and 21st of November there are two sums of 5,6851. and 3,1101. placed to the credit of the account with the Bank of England, will you tell me from wnat source those two rums came 7-I cannot; I have no recollection at all.
Have you any means of ascertaining ?-No doubt I should refer to the accountant of the bank for that information. I have none at all.
I find on the same days, namely, on the 20th and 21st of November, two checks are drawn in favour of Mr. James, which are signed by R. Hartley Kennedy, Edward Esdaile, and Hugh unes Cameron. Are those two checks signed by you, Mr. Alderman Kennedy, and Mr. Cameron?They are certainly signed by myself. I believe, also, by Mr. Kiennedy, and that is MIr. Cameron's signature.
Can yoa tellume for what purpose those two checks were drawn 7.-I cannot. I have no recollection of the circumstance.
Have you any means of obtaining information upon that subject ?-Not that I know of, except with reference to the account-books at that time.
Who is Mr. James,. in whose favour the checks are drawn ?-I do not at aU remember. I cannot bring the cir. cmnstance to my recollection at all.
Do you know whetber any loan bad been obtained by the directors of the Royal British Bank for the purpose of making it appear that the account in the Bank of England was larger thanit actually was ?-Not to myrecollection.
It is a matter of considerable importance, and about which one would think your memory would enable you to answer with certainty. I ask you again, ar you not aware that the directors of the Royal British Bank borrowed money for the purpose of pay6 gin to the credit of their account with the Bank of England, in order to swell up the amount standing to their credit at the time they conmenced business?-Speaking from my recollection at the moment, I cannot say that I do recollect the circumstance.
Is that the only answer you give to that question ?-That is my answer.
Can you pledge your word that no such loans wera obtained ?I s1hodugld think not, from the imperfeot recollection of the circumstance on that day. I should not like to pledge myself to any statement that was not coincident exactly with my recollection. If it had been so, I should have no motive in concealing it, 3r. Linklater; at least, I should give you my most straightforward impression.
Do yon believe it to be trao that loans wero obtained on behal of the directors for the purpose to which I have alluded ?-I do not recollect the circumstance.
Do you believe it to be true ?-I cannot give an answer satisfactory to myself to that question.
Again I mus ask you, do you believe it to be true? Pray attend to the question. Do you believe it to be true? I do not wish to attribute your hesitation to any unwilling. ness to answer.-Not at al. I am only considering what answer I can give truLthfully.
I must bave an answer to that queetion 2-I have no recol. lection of the fact.
That is no answer.
The CocscrsisosIc&.-What is your belief upon the subject? If you have no belief one way or the other, of course yon wIl say so.-To be very candid with you, I have no relief upon the subject. hmymind is a blank upon the sub. ect entrely; I have no belief.
Having your attention drawn to the circumstance of the two checks, which you say you signed7.-Most clearly. I have signed those checks, but the name of Mr. James-
I Tthe CO lS.SIONEx.-Does that bring it to your recol-
wit te bnk ittoyour recollection as being connected D-I not know whether any of my brother
d arepresent, but it does not occur to my own recollection,.I it did I would say so without scruple and without hesitation.
Mr. lNKLATM-I.t us bave no mistake as to your meaning. What I ask you is this,-Do you or do you not believe that the directors borrowed money before the opening of the bank for the purpose of having it phlced to the credit of the account, and drew out that money immediately afftersafrds ?-I have no belief founded upon a recollection
I thought we were likely to have some mistake upon your former answer. I therefore must repeat it. With or without a recollection of the fact, do you believe that such a loan was obtained ?
The CoznnssmiNER.-If you recollected the fact you could state It. If not, you are asked whether there is any. thing which enables you to have a belief upon the subject one way or the other. Your maind may preponderate one way so as to induce a belief that it was so; or it may preponderate the other way so as to induce a belief that it was not so; or it may be a perfect blank-total ignorance, and no belief at all. But it can hardly be supposed. you cannot have abelief one way orthe other. You are asked as tothe fact of what is your beief.
Mr. ITNKLATEn.-It is by no means an unimportant question. I suppose you have heard it stated as a fact that such loans were obtained ?-No, I have not.
I will ask you again. Do you believe that there were such loans ?-I can giv no furthe answer than I have.
30r. VxNNING.-Would it notebeobetter to ask the witnes whether be was an actor in the transaction. It is one thin tosigna ceck ogeher ithtwobrother directors, adt isanothertehing toebte arnacttohr alone inthe matter.

Mr. Lirxr,.&ATm-We Will take your answer as such. I obwerve it is stated in the account to hich you have reerred, and which we will mark "A," 'that there were 86 shares allotted to Mr. Cameron, upon which the first and second instalments would be 4,300l.'.-.I dare say there
Did the directors receive fromMr. Cameron his promissory note for that amount ?-I have no doubt they did.
Did Mr. Cameron ever pay one farthing on those shares' -In inoney?
Did he ever pay one farthing on those shares?-I cannot Lay that be did, but we held him strictly responsible, belevig that he was able to assume the responsibility of them. Mr. Cameron ws then looked upon as a man of means quite equal to that obligation,
Then, was Mr. Cameron's promissory note for 4,300W., a portion of what the directors represented as the paid-u capital ?-I presume It was so. It states the fact he m I have no doubt that is correct.

Weoe YOU present at the mieting on the 13th of July, 1349?-~Yef.
Were you present when the riepresentation to' er Ma. es nConIl 'was laid on the ta'ble, engrosse andt signea byiif.M'Gregos., Mt. Kenney, Mr- Cameron Mr. G nne, ?sir. Hertz, Mr. 0Owen, and Mr. Apsley Pzljtt?...Unoi should say I was not, or my name would be included. I should sayI must have been absent from the room at tbat time. I cannot say so bhut it is natural to infer that, or wby should ay name he left out ?
Were you present at the meeting on the 20th of Jnly, when the minutes of the meeting of the 13th of July, 1849, vere readl nad confirmed ?-I have no doubt of it. My name is hare reported.
Before the 19th of November had the dirctors of the bank made a loan to Sir James VKenzie of 7,5001 ?-They did, to the best of my recollection. Icannot speak to the date, but my impression is that they did.
Will you refer to the ninute of the 29th of October, 1819, made at the meeting of directors on that day, and say whether you were present at that meeting when the loan was authorized ?-I wa§ present at that meeting.
You say you were present at that meeting?7-Yes.
Can you tell me how much had been expended in prelimnary expenses before the l9th of November, 1849 1-I have not got that in my recollection. It is stated here as 9,5231, and, as it is the reult of Mr. Coleman's figares, I presume it is correct.
Was any portion of that amount of 9,523& lls. lOd divided amon5 the diretors ?-A sum for their ervioes for tbe year 184 was divided among them ; but really I cannot say whether it was included in the 9,5231
I must now ask you distinctly, was not a sam of 1,000k, which was represented as having been made for preliminary expenses, divnded among ome of the directors r-I beleve a sum about that amount ws dinided among the directors, but whether they included it in that 9,523 I do not
Have you any means of ascertaining whether the 1,OOt so divided was included or not ?-The hooks must show that.
Then, before your next examination you. wil be able to ascertain that fact ?-I have no doubt I can.
Does your memory enable you to say whether that sum of 1,000t was divided among the directors for their aervices in 1849 ?-I presume not long before the bank commenced operations; a yesr must have expifed before the division was made.
Younpresunme not long before the bank oommenoed ?-I should think not
But does your memory enable you to say it vas thst 1000' ?-This hook via give us the fact of the date of the diviion.
Perhaps you will be kdnd enough to find it-I am not contesting the fact of the division, ar. Linklater. I quite admit the division was among us, if that is what yoa are aiming at.
I am aiming at nothing beyond eiciting the truth, and I am not here contesting with you or any one. I am only desirous of ascertaining the fact whether or not before the bank commenced businesa a sum of 1,0001. was divided by the directors among themselves for their services prior to that time ?-That a sum was divided of about that amount I have fully in my recollection, but whether it was in October, November, or in the month subsequent to the opening of the bank I do not now remember. Whether it was includedin that amount for preliminy expense I do not kDow. It might be.
The CoM2nssio.N xP.-Does it not appear in the minate. book?
Mr. L1ENxLrTrF-No. I am entitled to answer your question, otherwise I should nothave been at liberty to make the suggestion. 9,5231 lls lOdw was said tohhave been expended in preliminay expenses, and thesuggestion is, that 1,0001 of that was, in trath, not a preliminr expense, but was a sum which the directors took for themslves, without letting it appear in the books at all, and that they divided it among themselves.-If that vas done it was done by a resolution of the board.
How much of that l0 did you receive t-What my proportion was I do not know. We paid a much larger proportion to our governor of the day, Mr. 3PGrezor, hut whether my proportion was 1001., 1201., or 150L, I do not know.
Have you no recollection about the amount ?-No, I have not indeed. Tothe best of my recollection a larger sum was appropriated to the governor for his expenditure, his time, and other considerations, and the balance was divided in equal proportions among the men who had worked through the year of the establishing of the bank.
I think if you refer to the minute of the 19th of NoTember, 1849, you will find that a sum of 500. wa3s awarded to the governor and Mr. WGr or as a remuneration, though an inadequate one, it is said, for his important services Mn the formation of the bank, and that a sum of 600 was also awarded out of the fund of the bank to the rest of the directors, in the proportion of their respective attendances, as a remuneration for their services in the formation of the bank.-Without reference to the books, I have no doubt that it is correct.
You have no doubt that is correct ?-Not at all.
YorU erepresent at that meeting on the 19th of Novem. ber, 18497.-Yes.
The Co3niimIIoNxl.-That is the sum you spoke of.
Mr. LniAyxst.-I presume that would be it-1,1001. I thought it bad been 1,001.
The petition for the original charter, I think, was presented in June, 18491-I dare say it was, or about that time.
You have told us that the bank commenced business on the 19th of November in that year ?-That is the date, I believe.
The capital consisted of 1,000 shares of 1001. each?-Ye. Upon which 50,000L had been paid?-Paid, orrepresented as paid.
Paid, or represented as paid in the bank, you have already stated '-Yes
Mr. Mullens, I think, was one of the solicitors to the bankz ?-Yes.
And he died in 1537'-Yes.
In what amount was Mr. Mullens indebted to the bank at the time of his death?-I cannot say. The books will declare that.
Abont?-Some thousands, upon which certain securities of policies were held of his.
Can you tell me what is the total amount of the loss by the bank through MEr. ulleues ?-I dare say it was about
13,000L, w;as it not'.-I do not know. I cannot say.
At a1l events, whatever the lees was, It was known to the directors before the end of the year 1853 ?-Not known before his death.
Not known before his death, but was known to the directors before the end of the year 1853 7-I presume so; it must have transpired soon after his decease.
Were you present at the meeting of the directors on the 13th of December, 1853 ?-Yes.
And were you one of those who voted in favour of the resolution that the Court was desirous to record their regard for the memory of Mr. Mullens, and their lively recoUection of his socialandmany amiablo qualities ?-So perfectlywere we impressed with the integrity of his character up to that time.
Do you remember a claim being made by *Mr Goodrich to some titledeeds which had been lodged with the bank by 'Mr. Mulens as security for an advance to himself ?-Yes.
The bank afterwards gave up those deeds to Mrs. Goodrich without a payment of any sum whatever ?-I am not quite sure as tothe fact.
Refer, if you please, to the minute of the meeting of the directors of the 18th of April,18541-That there was a point i dispute about these securities Iam perfectly well awvare.
Were you present at the meeting on the 18th of April, 1854'.-No, ie appears not by the record.
Were you aware of the minute of the resolution passed by the directors at t-hat meeting on the 18th of April,
The Co3nm9sloli.-PerhaPs it was at a subsequent meeting?
Mr. Letin xTs.-It does not appear that Mr. Badaile was present for two or three meetings after that,
The Witness.-I do not see the particulars,
You will find it there (pointing to a book). Do you find on that day a resolution to the effect that the committee reported to the Court that they could not find any evidence that Mr.Goodrich had given MSr. Mullens an authority to deposit the deeds, and they were accordingly direct"ed to be given up to her .'-Yes, I have no doubt that is correct.
Mfr. Cameron wvas the general manager of the bank at the
We have heard of what has been called a small private ledger.-Yes.
This large green volume,-is this the ledger?-That is the pocket ledger.
That is called the pocket ledger?-Yes.
Had you access from time to time to that book ?-I never opened it until after I assamed the chair.
But didyou when you became governor, inFebruary,1855? -Yes.
Had you not prior to that time seen this greeu book?I do not think it had ever come under my hands. Perhaps I should hardly say that. I could hardly have been in Mr. Carneron!s private room without having seen it upon his table, hut 1 never investigated its contents.
Was it a book which was accessble to any director who chose to look at it, in Mr. Cameron's room or elsewhere ?- It might have been aocessible, but it ws not the practice of the directors to refer to it.
Have yen any doubt. thatyou have sen it from time to time in Mr. Camneron's roomi?-No, I can h-ardyhave much doubt about that, I think,
Mrt. LINRx.rr.n (to the Co missioner).-Sir, Mr. Noyes is attending from the Privy Council-office with some of the original papers. We shallhave to go back for one moment toone or two questions to Mr. Ridaile. A certificate is pro. duced, dated the 16th of Novembr, 1849, addressed from the Royal British Bank, No. 16 Tokenhouse.yard, Lotlibury, London, "Tothe Right B5on. the President of the Committee of Her Majesty' Pivy Ceunel for Trade and Plantations.'
Is that certificate signed by yourself ?-Yes. By Mr. r regor, the overnor7-Yes.
By Mr. Owen, M1r. AliFerman Kennedy. deputy-governor; by Wilfliam Daniel Owen, a director; Cha5rles Walton, a director; James Gwynne, a director; yurself; Mr. Hertz, 4 director; and r. Apsley Pelltt, a director ?-Yes;
Is not the representation, in that certificate untrue, that one-half of the amount of eah share had been paid up in respect of all such abares?-It is not untrue, according to ouri mode of viewing the fulfilment of the s-Pirit of theAct.
But in fact it is incorrect?-As far as the 50,0001. is not in sovereigns or bank-notes, incorrs6t.

The 00 xSSIONR..-YeS
Mn r1cLnArTgn.-1 believe that the directors had many promises from persons resident in and near Newcastle to take shares in the Royal Brittsh Bnk -Yes, I believe they bad.
And that deposits were pLid to some considerable amount from persons resident there ?-Yes, I believe so.
Do you rememnber that Mr. Alderman Kennedy and Mr. Cameron thenmselves canvassbd Newcastle for the par-
pse Of getting Sharesl-1 am aware that Mr. Aldermnau Kennedy visited Newcastle with that view.
Were yout preent at the court of directors on the 23i of October, 1849?-Yes.
Is it correct that on that day it was resolved that Ur. Mullens should be instructed to go to Newcastle for the purpose of completing a negotiation with the subscriboers thece who had not paid their instalments for the transfer of their respective shares, and that a check should be drawn and placed irn the hands of Mr. MUnUens for 6201., to be re'nrned if necessary to the subscribers on their completing the transfer of such shares?-No doabt that resolution wag Passed.
Then, were yon present at tho meeting of the court of directors on the 29th of October, 1849'-1 have no doubt of it, if my nfame is there.
You have no doubt you ware ?-I have no doubt of it
Is it correct, then, that Mr. MuBens reported at that meeting the result of his pronal application to the subscribers at Newcastle who had not paid up their instalments. and it appeared that 64 of those persons had transferred their shares back to the general manager on receipt from the bank of their respective deposits, and 127 of the subscribers were likely to retain their shares, some of thenm having already pid their instalments to Mr. Hullens, and otbers of them having promised either to pay or secure the same ?-I cannot dispute the correctness of that.
Then, were the shares held by those 64 persons transferred into the name of Mr. Cameron, the general manager ?-That I cannot say from recollection.
I should have said 61 shares, and not 61 persons Do you find by the register of transfers that on the 26th of October, 1849, there wareo 49 shares transferred by several persons at Newcastle into the name of Cameron ?-I have no doubt of the fact.
And the deposits paid upon those shares were returned to the persona to whon they were originally allottod ?-I suppose so. I believe so.
Were you resnt at the meoting of the court of directors of the 24th of August, 1849 ?-Yes.
Do you find that by a resolution of the court on that day it was resolved that a check be drawn on the Bank of England for 6101., in order to pay the following sums-namely. James Dixon, 4001.; Archibald W. Blane, 1001.; John Fleming 501.; William P1 Warwick, 204- WlViam D Hayr, 404-total, 6101. the above being the deposits which haa been resolved to be returnd to the depositors wsho had refused to sign the deed of constitution?1-That is the fact. I must admit it.
And that money was returned accordingly?-I believe it was. I had no reason to suppose otherise, our efforts to strengthen the preliminary formation of the bank through Newcastle having failed.
Mr. LrNrLATZP. (to the Commissioner).-In reference to the Act of Parliament, your Honour will find, it being importantthatthe object of my question shouldboundertoodbythe 7th and8th ofVictoria, chap. 13, sec. 5, your Honour wilU find it is distinctly stated that it shall not be lawful for companies to repay any part of the sums so paia up without leave of the Lords of the Committee.
The Coms1ONZR.-Yes.
Mr. LILXLATEiL-To return again to this green poocketledger.
3Ler. VxN soG.-I think it is very important that that part of the answer should appear. It was a mere substitution, as I understand the witness to state, of the share3 from parties who would not pay up to others who did; let that appear.
The Co.Nmissio'xn-It may appear upon a further question, but at present I have only got it that they were transferred to Cameron.
lr. VE\y.sG.-And from him afterwards to other persons, who became the owners.
MIr. LmN-cLATm.-Perhaps I had better state what the facts are, and, if MIr. Eadaile has any explanation to give upon it he will boe kind enough to correct me if I am wrong. Several shareholders at Newcastle having refused to pay the caUs made upon their shares, although they had already paid the 10L deposit, the company, or rather the court of directors, resolved that those shareholders should receive bhck their deposits from the company, and it then became necessary that the transfer should be executed to their own nominee, and Mr. Cameron's name was used for that purpose. Afterwards the company were successul in finding purchasers for some of those shares, and, from time to time, as purchasers were found, those shares wero transferred to anyoneowhe was unluckyenough to takethem.
The Witness.-May I be allowed to make an observation? You are not exactly cony - g the whole truth with regard to our communication withnewcastle. It was an understandingthere tbatif a considerable capital couldbe obtained from Newcastle the Newcastle shareholders should be considered to be part and parcel of the corporation of the bank. If we failed in making a great impression upon Newcastle, such as had come into the negotiation should not be damnified by any payment which they had made. It might have been strictly illegal, but it was fair in spirit I think.
Mr. I\KLATMT-IS there any explanation you desire to give in referenee to those shares ?-No.
I think ou have told me that your attention was first called to the cotents of that green ledger in the month of February, 1855 ?-Yes.
Were you the governor of the bank at that time ?-After the yearly meeting.
After the yearly moeting held in what month'.-Febru-
ot would be convenient for us to know on what day of the month that meeting was held ?-The first Friday, whatever that day is. The reports will show.
We will put in the date presently. Was Mr. Cameron ill at the time of that meeting ?-I think ho was not present at the meeting.
He was absent from the bank for some time?-No, he was not permanently absent from the bank until, I think, fter the meeting; he was not at the meeting, and for some months afterwards he was detained by very serious iness.
ie wsnot at the general meeting at which you were appointed governor, and he did not come to the bank for a considerable timne afterwards7-1 was not a ppointed governor at the meeting; it was not necessary, I was appointed governor by the court.
After you were appointed governor, I think your attendance was more frequent than it had previously been i
Mr. PADDISOy'.-lt was the 1st of February, 1855. Mr. VESNNIso.-Only convening a meeting.
Mr. PADDISON.-It was in February, and the minute of the 31st of January says :-' The court having been summoned to reconsider the resolution passed on Tuesday lest respecting the directors to retire in rotation at the annual meeting of shareholders to-morrow"-that is, the 31st.
Mr. LLUKLATEP-YOU find now you were appointed governor on the 1st of February, 1855 I-Yes.
I think for many months after your appointment you were, I may say, umemitting in your attendance at the bank ?-I was there very considerably.
Had you occasion to refer to the several accounts contained In-that green ledger?-Very shortly after my appointment as governor.
Had you occasion to refer to the accounts in the green ledger ?-Yes.
When you say very shortly, do you mean almost immediately afterwards ?-Almost immediately afterwards.
Afew days ?-May I explain?
If you please.-Very shortly after I came to the chair it occurred to my knowledge that advances hadbeen made, unknown to myself, upon a class of secrities which had not been hitherto repored as proper securitis for the bank -namely, shipping securities, wrhich led me to investigate the accounts of certain debtors to the bank, and I was desermined that no accounts should exist which werenot under my rigid control, and that led me to an investigation of the accounts.
And that led to the investigation of the accounts throughout the entire book ?-Of this house-ledger,
Can you give me the name of the person to whose account your attention was first dtrected 7-I have no objection-it was Mr. Hunmphrey Brown.
And it was in consequence of information that you obtained with reference to that account which led you to examine the contents of that geen ledger ?-In consequence of certain facts having transpired which nocessarily case before me s governor.
Did yotl find, on looking at that green ledger that several of the directors had accounts opened in the b,ooks of the bank ?-Yes.
Give me the names of the directors, if you please, with whom you found accounts hadbeen opened.-NEr. M'Gregor, Mr. Gwynne, r. Cameron, myself, lr. [Humphrey Brown, and Mr. Coppin. I believe there are no others.
Mtr. Walton s-Yes, Mr. George Walton. He was a director at that time 1-Yes.
Did you refer to the minutes of the finance committee for the purpooe of seeing whether those accounts had boea cpened by their authority?-No; I did not think it necessary to do so.
Was it not one of the reguLlations of the bank that no aCcount should be opened except under the precise sanction of the finance committee 1-That was a rnle of the bank, that no bills ahould be discounted except by their sanction.
-Do_you happen to knowv it as a fact 7.-I do not know that
that rule was strictly observed upon the opening of drawlng and discount accounts of the directors themselves; they would not probably have gone through that same routine; for instance, some of the directors' acconnts were alwayS largely incredit, andothers had aperfectlylegitimate discount

whs were connected with that direction I believe tlreo or our, at thp outside, are now obligants.
Did you find Mr. Cameron was at that time largely indebted to the bank ?-Then I found it for the firsttim e.
Did yoit find then jthat he owed the bank upwards of 15,0001. upon his discount account?-Yes, I remember the sum.
Wil you tell me what is the meaning of this entry"To the credit of the acconnt of Hugh Innes Cameron, Ea. ward Esdaile, M 0ay 6,500"-n nder the head of " discount?" -A sum of money I took for him upon my own note and retired at maturity-that is, the sum of 6001
I do not quite understan d that. Does not this * ntry represents discoun t by the bank on May the 6th for a bil accepted by you for 500L ?-Yes.

The balance of profitwvhich you representbythat account as to be divided amongst your shareholders is no more and not so much, as the interest which ii included in the 800,0001. for interest aCCrunig upon your owuWekhvrks ? -But this is only the balance.
Yes, but of 15,0001. for interest, that is calculated upon these works more against the net ptofit, when you made no profit, I apprehend ?-That would be so.
I am proposing at a future stage to direct Mr. Eadaile's attention to the details of many of the debts.-I am bound to tell you I did not know the mode in which the interest was calculated until after I came to the chair.
Now, I ask you whether tho bad and doubtful debts included in that item of 810,0001. did not exceed bad and doubtful debts 150,0001. ?-Bad and doubtful together, I suppose it must have been.
And yoa knew that on the Ist of August, 1856!-Yes
Does not the same observation apply, though not quite to so great an extent, to the half.year]y account endmg in December, 1855, and June, 1855?-Partially.
Did you not know that the accounts submitted to the shareholders for the half-year ending 30th December, 1854, were unttue? -Subject to the same explanation.
Did you not know that the accounts submitted to the shareholders for the half-year ending 30th of June, 1855, for the half-year ending December, 1855, also were nmtrne?Subject to the eame explanation.
You did subject tothe same explanation ?-That is to say, we knew we had doubtful figures, which we hoped that future prosperity would have enabled us to cover up.
You knew that in the three accounts ending Decembor, 1854, June, 1855, and December, 1855, there was a large amount represented as an asset which in truth consisted of
bad aDddoubtful debts ?-Yes, I dare sayrwe did in the same way, whi we reserved for a strong state of the bank to
Then did you not know that there ouzht to have been no division as of profit in the years 1854,1855, and 1855 ?-Of course, if we had been governed by -
Bythe truth?-By the principle of valuing every obligation contained in the books of the bank at its exact value.
Did you not know in December, 1854, in June and December, 1855,and in June, 1856-at each of those periods, that if you had taken off from the assets of the bank those debts that were bad, and only those that were bad, you ought not to have divided one shilling of prefit among the share. holders?-Yes, if we had deemod it under the circum. stances of the bank politic to act in that rigorous way.
Were not the same circumstances known to your fellow. directors ?-I presume the same impressions were present to their minds. I do not like to spea for others.
I ask you whether, before the completion of the accounts ending the 30th of June, 1856, there were not frequent coi.sultations betveen yourself and your fellow-directors, whether you ought or ought not to misrepresent the affairs of the bank;-Whether we ought or not to make a dividend there was.
I ask you whether there were aet discussions ameng your body, before the accounts were closed up to the end of Jume, 1856, as to. the propriety of setting forth the bad and doubtful debts in a different manner '.-Ne, Ihave to recollection of it at all
I observe that your signature is attached to the certificate presented to the Lords of the Committee of Her Majests 2rivy Council on tho 19th of June, 1855 ?-Yes.
That certificate is signed by yourself, Mr. Valliant, Mr. Owen, Mr. MCleod, Mr. Humphrey Brown, Mr. Cochrane, and Mr. Alderman Kennedy ?-Yes.
I will read it. (Read.)
This letter is in the handwriting of Mr. Paddison, is it not ?-Yes.
It is a letter dated Royal British Bank, Tokenhouse-yard, the 20th of June, 1855. (Read.)
Now, I will ask you whether, at the time you sent that certificate to the Board of Trade, you did not well know that the bank was in a state of hopeless insolvency ?-No, not of hopeless insolvency.
Or a state of insolvency '-In a state of difficulty, which we hoped to recover.
In a state of insolvency ?-We required more strength. In a state of insolvency?
The ComnIussioNxsR.-You just said with marked emphasis not in a state of hopeless insolvency, which seemed rather to lead to the inference that it was insolvent, and that it wanted an increase of capital to enable it to go on? -Well that must be implied.
Mr. LINKLATER..-We will have no implication. Is it not a fact that you knew the bank to be then in a state of insolvency?-We knew it, of course, to bo in a state of embarrassment.
Again, the word, I repeat to you is insolvenoy.
The Comnossro.N-m-You could not have paid your way, except through the medium of some new capital ?- NO.
Then it is like being insolvent.
Mr. LD ;LATLR.-Are we to take it that it was in a state of insolvency ?-Yes, I suppose so.
Did you not know it 7--Though at the same time tho circumstances-
Did you not know that it had lost all the capital that wras paid up, and was still in a state of insolvency ?-I repeat again, I told you by what motives we were actuated.
The CoosnssioNM-We will first get at the facts, and then you may explain the motives. You may have done a very bad action from a good motive, or you may havo done a bad action from a bad motive. You seem to introduce the motive into the fact .-Will you repeat the question ?
Mr. LIvrLAT .-Yes, I will. Were you not satisfied that in June, 1855, the bank had lost all its paid-up capital and was in a state of insolvency ?-The state of the capital then vas 50,0001., was it not?
Yes.-I do not think I can say that, Mr. Linklater. In June, 1855, we were prepared to say that the whole of the paid-up capital was lost. At that time we had a certain reserve.
You stated in the account up to 30th of June, 1855, that your assets consisted of loans on convertible securities for short periods, advances on cash credit accounts, bills depo. sited, &c., 898,7131. 4s. lid. I ask you again the question, having regard to the bad debts that had been made and the doubtful debts which existed then, whether lyou did not know at that time that the capital which had be U had been lost, and that the bank wps in a state o f
vency ?-Certainly our iwplication was that much of the paid-up capital was compromised. You asked me to say whether the whole was lost * I am not prepared to say that of my own knowledge. We had reason to fear that a consirable part of the capital was swrallowed up.
h Do you mean to tell me that you did not believe, in June 1855, all the paid-up capital had gone '.-I do not think f am repredto ay,fro myowuknolede,as much as You became governor in February, 1855. You had aocess to that green ledger in February, 1855, and I ask you whether in June, 1855, you did not know that all the paidup capital was lost ?-You must not refer too much to this book. You must remember, while we believed that we should recover from Mr. Cameron, we believed that Mr. Humnphrey Browvn's ecurities would have paid 20s. in the pound, and, while we had no reason to fear there woald be any lees upon Mr. Charles Walton's account, we had none. You nmust not lay too much stress upon my knowledge as drawnufrom this book.
You may bring your mind to a conclusion by any means you like, but I am asking you only a plain question-whether, having become governor in February, 1855, and having access t the green book in February, 1855, you did not know that up to the month of June, i155, all the paid-up capital had been made ?; That is my question to you ?-You are referring to thed because there wca more capital paid up in 1tb h w
Not till after February, 1855 .-You say June, 1855.
But not till after Jene, 1855 ?-Yes, in the beginning of You are not looking to the first item under the head of liabilities. In June, 1855, the paid-up capital was 100.0Du., because you have gone in anticipation of sasuin your new sbares, receiving an amount of 601. per share from several persons to whom shares were subsequently issued ?-I mean to say it hid not been declared.
At all events, even with the increase of paid-up capital which your supplemental charter gave you the power to raise, makig the paid-up capital 10,0001. I ha& that in mind when I asked the question, and which ques;ion I repeat. Did you not know in June, 1855, that the whole 100,0001. was lost? That is my question to you, and I will prove it?-I was not prepared to aJy that before Mr. Colemau'sstatemens were, in their minutisT, placed beforeauts.
Did you believe that the bank was solvent then ?-No. I have aIready admitted, subject to my own explanation, that wre did not atihat time regard it as solvent.
Do I nowv understand you to say that you belecved the original paid-up ca,pital of S0,v0vl. had been lost, and that
the bank was iusolvent in June, 1855 ?-I thinkImust admit as much as that.
Then, do I understand you to say that, including the ac. count of June, 1855, and from that time down to the closing
of the bank, ion went on dividing the dividends in the shape
of profits, aIthough you belielved the whole first paid-up
capiltal had gone ?-Yes.
IYott wen on denlring a dividend in the shape of profit
to the shareholders, altlhough you knew the whole of the original paid-up capital of 50,0001. had been lost?-We surmised it.
When did you first cpntomplate the iSsuing of the second thousand shares t-We contemplated it a long time before it took place, but certainly more than a year.
When did yo firzt obtain any deposit from any shareholder in respect of those thousand shares ?-I cannot say exactly. I should say balf a year previous.
June, 18-5 ?-Oh, yes!
It was not until after you became governor that it was resolved to issue these 1,000 shares ?-Oh, yes I
Finally contemplated s -YES iin fact, eertain instalments had been amid in before I became governor. I think so. I think letters of application had been received before December. I
Refer, if you please. You attended the meeting of the Court of Directors, at which you presided as governor, on the 27th of February, 1S5,.-1855
Yes ?-No.

Did you, on the 1Ith of August, owe Mr. Caoeo a'" monoyt-He advanced me 5 upon my note. I h;A never a drawing account with the bank. That wiU explan It.
Did Mfr. Cameron lend you 500X before yom pgae him your promissory note ?-No; not before.
Did you apply to hMr. Cameron in the month of August, 1854, for aloan of 5001 7Yea.
Mr. Catneron consentod, as I understood you, to miako the
For that amount -you gavo him a promissory noto payable in his favour 7-Yes.
And that note he disoonnted with the Etoyal Briti* Bank ?-Yes.
That promissory note was plaoed to tho debit of his discount account, and yon roceived the money by a check drawn by him upon the bank t-I presueo so
At that time I find by this discount account that he owed the bank upwards of 15,0001.?-It appears to be so. Of the account at that time I know nothing.
Did you know that Mr. Cameron was going to geot that 5001. from the mones of they bank !-Most clearly it was a discount. I never had an account with the bank.
Did you not consider it worth your while to inquire what. was the state of Cameron's account at that time 7-No.
Did you know that he had a discount account with the bankt-I must have presumed that ho had, because there were notes pasing continually through tho bank.
I ask you, did Tom or did you not know that Mr. Cameron bxd a discount account with the bank?-I think I may fairly gay at that time I did not.
Will you undertake to pledge your word that you did not know that Mr. Cameron bad a discount account with the bank t-Yes, I may truthfully axy so; at the sameotime he must neoessarilv have ha accounts with the bank because he was passing large sums of money from Scotland and d2ef where.
Did you not know he intended to discount that SoOL promisory note with the bankt-Yee, I presme that I did.
Did you take any pains to scertain whether he had applied to the finanoe oommitteo for authority to have the discount 7-No.
Ought not application to the finance ommittee to have been made biy aperson ror discount ho had previously no account opent7-If the thing had been rigorously treated perhapsl it ouht to have been made; but that rulo never applied to a director's account.
Mr. Cameron was no diretor 7-He rwas our genoral manager.
He seoms to have managod here pretty well. I Ask whether, according to the regulations of the bank, it would not have been necessary in tho ordinary course of business for Mr. Cameron, if h. had no dscount account with the bank, to apply to tho finance oommitteo for liberty to havo your promissory note discounted ?-By thr rule of the bank it would haLve been neeeasary in all ordinaryrea30 - but as he knew that I, as a direotor of the bank, had -no obligations of any kind with the bank, he presumed for a transaction of that trivial naturo it was not neoesrs . That is the only interpretation that I can give of it, nor was it necessary in *act.
The CoNirssioxNE.-It was not adbanokd t trust to bank, hut through Mr. Camerona,sageont t-Because f haa no account at the bank of any ldnd. -I did not even hare a drawing account at the bank, mush loss a dbscountso conat.
The Cosrsnssxo?xER.-I mean the hank did not trust to you-they trusted Cameron 7-Yes, therefore it was a private transaction betwoen himself and me-a purely private transacion.
Mr. LuiLATxzt.-You knew that CLmoron had got that note discounted by the bank ?-I did not know it, but I pra-
sume that he did. I hav no objection to say that.
Did you oommunioate to any of your fellow-dirctors that that transaction had taken plaeo botween Tou ?-I do not know that I did at the time, bat they knew it afterwards.
How soon after tho 16th of Angust did iny of your foeowdirectors knowr that you had obtained that 5001. of Cameron t-Not pobably until I was examining the accounts with them,
In the month of February, 18557-Probably.
That promissory note of 5001. beeame due on November tho 6th -And then it was renowea.
'Was it paid by you at maturity 7-No because it waS a current noto -it was a note on demand I Welieve.
That is not so. Did not that note for 6001 become due on the 6th of November ?-The accountant through whoni the transaetion went chose to make the advance in this form as a renewable obligation until it was paid. I took it up originally. It was a six months' transaction.
Do I understand you to represent that that promissornote WAS payable on demand ?-My impression is that it was so.
And the entry in this book, that it was-to become duo on November 6, is incorrect?-That is from Mr. Crawford'a treatment.
And did not appear upon the face of the note 7-I think not. You will find it so-the same obligation.
Did you on November 7 or November 6 give to Mr. Cameron a promissorynote for5001 ?-No I knew nothing aboutit until I paid my check for 500.
You gavo him no such promissory note ?-No, not apin. Then this check incorrectly represents the transaction when it says that on November the 7th the bank disconnted for Mr. Cameron yourpromissory note which became due on February the 6th, for 500L?-1I shouldsay that it does. If yonwill allow me to say so at the timo I passad mycheek in I said to Lr. Crawford, VWhat is your objoet in maslng aL these renowals in this way, when It Is one obligation r "This is the promissory note,' I said, whon I passed my check to take up the note, which I did at what I supposod to be proper maturity. In turning up this account I observed the same transaction appoared to be repeated over and over again. I sid to our accountant, I What is the object of treating it in this way, when it is a simple obligtion upon a promissory noter and he said, "Oh, that is our custom."
Do I understand you to say that in the month of August 1854, Mr. Cameron promised to lend you for six months the 5001. and that you paid it at the expiration of that time?I will not say it was exactly at the expiration of six months. When did you pay itt?- do not know it is clumped together with the 1,600L in a very foolisi vway. I have never paid more than 5001.
When did yon pay it-on the 28th of February ?-On the 28th of February.
Did you pay any interest to Mr. Cameron on that advance s-I presume I did; 6 percent. I believe it was.
Presumeol Did you 7-Yes; I paid interest for the note. You say it is 1,600c; it is incorrect. It is the same as three renewrals.
Then it is three times 5004; but as three times 5001. ae debited to the account it became necessary to put the figures to tho credit of the same account ?-I disputed with him the form of tho transaction.
But you did not pay your 5004 until after it became known to you and your fellow-directors that Mir. Cameron was so largely indebted to the bankt-No, in point of fact I did not.
What do you mean by a " in point of fact?"
Mr. VBSISG.-It appears to me that that is a proper answer.
I mean to say, in point of fact, because I always intended to take up my note when it became due. It is a most unfair imputation. It is making a great deal of fuss aboutnothing. It was a simplo transaction.
Mr. LuzKL&TXz.-It will be for others to judgo of that transaction. Is that the first and only transaction you had with Mr. Cameron ?-Yes.
Was ho in the habit of accommodating other directors in the same way ?-I do not know; I suppose he ws. I think therevwere discount accounts underl the names of Walton and Humpbrey Brown. The books will of course show it.
Do you find that the acceptanoes or notes of Mr. X'Leod, Mr. Owen, Mr. Humphrey Drown, and Mr. Hurlstonrwere from time to timo passed through tho account of Mr. Cameron ?-It appears that they were.
Mr. VEmuwG.-Wili you ask the witness what his object in borrowing the 500. was? It wil bo but fair to the witness that it should appear.
Mr. LuixLART.-I shaU bo most happy to attend to any suggestion that comes from you on the part of Mr. Easdaile, and -I am sure the Court will let Mr. Fsdaie explain anything he likes upon the sublect. I shall be glad to have any explanation he chooses to gnve of the objeet he had in view in entering into that transaction.
The Witness.-It was resolved that the directors of the da;y should double their qualification at the ban It did not suit me at the time to devoto e00. from my own resouros to the bank, and I said to Mr. Cameron, " Would it be coneniernt to ou. to lend me that upon my promissory note for the time ?" and he said, " Certainly ;" and then it was merely a question of interest between us. The application of the 500. was to take up my 10 now shares.
Mr. VENKnuG.-To doubleoyour stake in the bank, in fact 7
The Witness.-That is the history of the transaction.
Mr. LiDKLATER-Did you apply that 500c for the pay. raent upon ten now shares to be allotted to you in the
Mr. VxN-NG.-Ithink you will agree with me that it is but fair that it should come out.
Mr. LxsIsA7%-I am not now dealing with the efrbctI am only now dealing with the fact.
Independently of being indebted in upr ards of 15,O004 upon his discount account, did you find, in the month of February, that Mr. Cameron was also indebted upon his drawing account in upwards of 2,0001. ?-If that is the figure representing the date, yes.
You had better look7-Yeg. Upwards of 2,0001 7-Yes.
I fndI have been rather misleading you and myself by refering to February, 185 inteadof ebruary,1855, as to the amount of the overdrawn account. The drawing a- count of February, 1855, was under L,OOM, and not as I stated upwards of 2,O00.7 -Yes.
I find that Mr. Cameron, upon his drawiig'account, was indebted to the bank min the early part of February, 115, in about 8001.?-More than that; he was very heavy in credit.
I am showing you, notwithstanding Mr. Cameron was indebted uponhis drawing account inthe earlypertofSebruary, 1855, to the bink in about 8001., thathe wasso upon his discount account to the amount of 15,0001. Does this book correctly repsent that, although you were governor from Febru mary, loS 5, do-v n to and after J une, 18%, you allowed Mr. Cameron to overdraw his account.t the amount of 3,9570-I dare ay.it does. t
DMes it?- From these 6fiures it appears so.
And although yout find, har the early part of Feb.ar
1855,. be lwas indebted to the Bank, on his deunt account 15,0001., -you' allowed t'hat discount account, to be Increased so as. torleave hinmindebtod4*oAIke ban&k, tge end of .the yeaijI8SS -19,14614 ?-I dare say,that mstd hATe

Did you, as governor, or did the Court of Directors, take say teps from the month of February, 1855, down to the tin2e of the closng of the bank, to effect the reduction of Camercn's account ?-Xepeatodly
The CONrcxSSIOieXx.-I want to know whether that 19,0001 and was advanced upon Cameron's personal
Mr.iL-KATM-Ycs.
The CoD0usnsosx. R-Was there no other ?-The trans. action came over again repeatedly.
Mr. LiwKLATRR.-But still the balance remains now. Toll us who is liable for any portion of that 19 1461 except MIr. Cameron, and what securities do the bank hold, if any, against the 19,1461. ?-Mr. Cameron is certainly solely obligant for that amount.
Will you tell me what securities, if any, you obtained from Mr. Cameron for the bank as Against any portion of that account ?-At that time, you must remember, the bank held shares of Cameron's in the bank itself, which before the failure of the bank were looked upon as good, as so mach security, but to what extent I do not quite know without knowing what number of shares the bank held of Mr. Cameron's, which must have amounted to some large amount. There was a policy of assurance.
Then upon the strength of the shares in the bank and other securities Mr. Cameron was allowed to go on increasing his discount account ?-Not so. There is the fact of the 14,OOOZ.
Were you not aware that by law the bank was restricted? The CoNusriomIu.-I was going to observe that the Oth article of the deed of settlement provides for that.
Mr. LtNKLATXR.-Were you not aware that by the law the bank had no right whatever to advance one shilling upon the security of its own shares 2-It was not done so. The advances were not made upon that security, but, inasmuch as Mr. Cameron held the shares, of course the bank was perfectly light in insisting upon having them paid over to them.
Is that how you run a coach-and-four through an Act of Parliament 7-Not so.
It was advanced without any seCurity at all ?-Made by hLim without my cognizance or of the directors.
With every means of cognizance, if it was not with your actual cognizance 7-That is where the laches has been, no doubt. X dmit that.
lr. LINKLATER.-Were you aware that one of the stipulations of the deed of settlement was for preventing the company from purchasing any shares, or making advances of money, or securities for money, to any person as security for shares in the partnership business ; and, notwithstanding that, were you a consenting party to receiving, as security in respect of Cameron's account, shares standing in the name of the company ?-No; not as security for any distinct advance.
I did not ask yoa that 2-Finding the shares, we held them as property.
Finding the shares, you held them as property ?-Of course.
Then, if among the documents found in the vaults of the bank there appears this-" Hugh Innes Cameron, Esq., 19 Royal British bank shares, deposited by Thomas Chandler for a loan of 8501., 11th February, 1854," it would not be correct, would it, to say that a loan of 8501. had been made upon such shares ?-There is one instance in which Mr. Cameron seems to have advanced upon shares. You were talking just now of his own advances.
I have something else to ask you presently.
The Co'suuIssoIxN-When you say Mr. Cameron knew, you mean the bank, I suppose .7-No, I do not. I mean tr. Cameron, acting for the bank.
Mr. Cameron acting for the hank is the bank. What I ean is was it not your loan, with Mr. Cameron ?-It was not with the cognizance of the court. When I make a distinction between Cameron-
The Co5iissioNERh.-What I want to know is, whether it was not done by Mr. Cameron in some way-if Mr. Cameron lent you 5001 ?-No, certainly not.
Mfr. IiN;KsATrR.-We will see in one moment how that ls.-I think you will find it there,-" Cash credit of Mr. Came ron."
Not Cameron, but Mr. Chaudler. Just refer to this ascount of Thomas Chandler. Do you find that the bank discounted for Thomas Chandler on the 11th of Febraary, 3854, Mr. Hugh Innes Cameron's promissory-note for 850?. ?-It appears to be so, but I was not aware of it.
Do you fin by the memorandum in this bundle containing shares of the bank that for securing the repayment of that 8501. Thomas Chandler deposited 19 shares in the Royal British Bank ?-Yes. It appears that was a transaction between Chandler and Cameron.
Then, I suppose, you are now aware that was an exceedngly irregular transaction, accordingto the charter of the bank 2-Yres, according to the charter,
Was Thomas Chandler one of the auditors of the bank ?
When did you first learn, if you ever did learn befoze this moment, that Mr. Chandler had obtained from the bank a loan of 8501. upon the shares of the bank 7-I sappose the knowledge must have come to me about the time I looked through this book.
In February, 1855 ?-I supposo so,
Did you get the money from Mr. Chandler ?-No. I think, Mr. Linklater, these shares must be looked upon simply as a collateral security; the promissory note to Chandler was a siuple matter of discount.
And that is a collateral security, you say 2-Yes.
That is one way of getting out of the requirements of the charter. Perhaps you will refer again to the account of Cameron-the discount account of the 3d of Augast, 1.85421
The CoDmnSwONmB.-Could there be a discount without any other name .7
AIr. LusZKLATlt.-It would be a promissory note payable to Mr. Cameron, endorsed by Mr. Chandler to the bank. That, I suppose, would be the transation ?-Let me look again at Mr. Chandler's account. I do not see now Mr. Cameron's promissory note. Mr. Chandler held the promissory note, which was discounted upon the faith, I presume, of Mlr. Cameron. We believed him to be a man possessed of freehold property to some extent.
So, that it would appear that Mr. Chandler, the auditor, being indebted to Mr. Cameron, the manager, gave Mr. Cameron, the manager, a promissory note for 8501., which would necessarily be by Mr. Cameron, the manager, and that would be discounted by the bank and debited to Mr. Chandler, who deposited his security for shares in the bank, -that is the transaction 1-No; 1 presume not; you are -ather mystifying it. Mr. Chandler required 8502. He comes to Mr. Cameron as the actuary of the bank, and says, wvll you advance mo that money upon my promissory note ? I can put into your hands as collateral security shares whioh I hold in tnis corporation.
Bat, as the bank were restricted by the terms of their charter from advancing money to any person upon the deposit of their shares, Mr. Cameron was the man who advanced his money and deposited the shares upon Mr. Chandler's promissory note and got that discounted with the bank ?-Yes; that is how he seems to have managed it. You are examining me upon questions which are purely of an executive character, which iwould not necessarily come before me as a director.
I am quite aware that details would not come before you as a director but the general result would, though ?-Yes, it nnfortunateiy has.
Now, referring to r. Camneron's account of the 3d of August, 1854, do you find also that the bank discounted for MIr. Cameron ?
Witneas.-For Mr. Brown, do you mean ?
For MIr. Cameron, in the month of Jaly, 1854, Mr. HEumphrey Brown's promissory note for 1,0002. ?-It appears to be so.
And does it also appear that MIr. Humphrey Brown lodged with Mr. Cameron shares belonging to Mr. Humphrey Brown in the Royal British Bank as securities for the 3.000. 7.-It says so here, but it is the first time I have seen this pasa-book.
Is it the first time the existence of that deposit as security has become known to you ?-Certainly not. I must have seen it from my examination of the account originally. I am talking now of thoese shares as security.
Seeing that you permitted the account of Mr. Cameron to increase from the month of February, 1855, to the time wzhen the bank closed, both in the discount andinthe drawing accounts, and no security against it, I ask you, have you any explanation to give .-Nxo, I have not; in fact, I was not aware of the increment in the accounts until r. Cameron finally left the bank. When Mr. Cameron resumed his duties my attention was then not so pointedly directed to this account, inasmuch as I laid down a rule in which I was corroboratedlby the directors, that these accounts should not be increased. You will find, if you look at the other side in the accoant that I was instrumental in working down these accounts-Mr. Walton's especially.
Do I understand you to represent that from the month ,when Mr. Cameron returned, after February, 1855, down to the time he left in August, 1856, you did not once refer to the state of MIr. Cameron's account in that ledger ? -I do not think I did. It was a question of sLx weeks.
From May, 1855, to July, 1856 ?-I must recall my observation. I do not mean to say that. HEo mnst have been there 18 months, upon the accounts.
Then, how ofton between the month of May, 1855, and July, 1856, did you refer to Mr. Cameroa's account ?-How often I camtot say, but very repeatedly to himself, calling his attention to the state of the account, both myself individually and the committee apDointed for the purpose.
Did you not find the aecount increasing from time to
time?'-'o, decreasing. You will find, if you look to the account, that the 15,0001 was reduced down to 12,000L, and then it went up to 13,0001., and then it went down to 12,0001., and so on.
Excuse me. In May he comes back ?-In May, 1855. it -ws 1,20001. reduced from 15,000C.; and this was an obligationt running at the time whic had to be renewed, which of course raised it to 13,000L2
Then it was not reduced ?-No; but there is some explanation with regard to that.
I suppose you became aware before the month of May, 1855, that te hank had lost by Mr. Cameron upwards of 15,0002 ?-That it had advanced to Mr. Cameron-not lost.-
I say lost by Cameron ?-No; certainly not.
Do6 understand you to represent that you had re-son to beieve in the month of May, 1855, when Cameron returned to the hank, that he could pay that money when called nposr ?-No, not when called upon; but that he had power amply to cover the bank for his obligations, and we believed to a recent period that we had it in our hands, from interest that he had in land and stock in England. We did not knowv till subsequently that that interest was mortgaged to
otherdpartes.
Did you betwean May, 1855, and the 1st of January, 1856, endeavour without ucceas to get security from Mr. Cameron 1-Yes.
In the general accounts laid before the shareholders at the general meeting in the month of February, 1856, was tho amonnt owing from Mr Cameron to the bank stated to be a good± asee of tha bank ?-It was a good asset.
I take it for granted that you knewthat fact i-Yet a nd I will go further and s that up to June, 1856, our solcitor, was awre that the Imnpression npon our mnuds wra that tho loa¶ through Mr. Cameron, fromtn he securities which we believed ha had, Sould be but tritiul. We had the policies our hands, andth baek shkres, and wevhtew we had the intreetin stock and land, and we likewise belieed tbAt be had.
tJ AQtak ryot whaSt scuritiss aid thoe Uaui hold aglaint
that sum of 19,0001. ?-There is a list of thhom somewhere. I cannot now tell them over my fingers. There were four or five securities of 1,0001°, 2,0001., or 3,0001. each.
Tel me what they were. Or would you rather defer annwerqing that qestion, so auto have the opportODity of inswering than the subject ?-Yes.aeeoprniyf
Jdo not want unfairly to ask you questions which you can scarecly be expected to have come prepared to answer. -No. We were told there was a 3 0001. policy which was to be redeemed from the National Bank of Scotland, and some other securities, but it was afterwards discovered that there were credits upon them.
In the half-yearly account in June, 1856, was not the debt owing from Mlr. Cameron to the bank also taken as a good asset ?-I have no doubt it was.
Have you any doubt that you knew at that time it was so taken and so treatedin the accounts of the bank ?-I have no doubt that it was so treated.
My question is, have you any doubt that you knew it was so treated at the time ?-No; I think not. I think there can he no doubt about that.
No doubt that you did know it ?-No.
And that at the end of the month of June, 1856, or the beginning of July in that year ?-1856; yes
Now, 1 will caU l our attention to the account connected with the Welsh works. The bank has lost, I believe, by the Welsh works, sulbject to what may be realized fr n them something like 120,0001. ?-I am afraid so; subje- to what is to be recovered, you say.
Subject to what is to be recovered from them. In the accounts for the half-year ending the 30th of June, 1856, were not thoseWelsls works taken asan asset of 120,000t.7They were taken at what already had been expended upon them.
120,0001. ?-Not in June, 1856.
1856 ?-No; I think not ; it was only that in 1857.
We are not there yet.-I say there must have been a considerable sum less than 120,0001. at that date. I should think so. That is a year ago, before the failure of the bank.
No ; Jume, 1856-last year-we are now in 1857 ?-I was so confused.
Then, in the half-yearly account presented by the Court of Directors, and sent to the shareholders by them for the half-year terminating on that day, as I understand you, the Welsh works were taken as a good asset for the full amount which they cost the bank, about 120,0001. ?-I believe they were. We were in strong hopes of raising a company, under the Limited Liability Act, for taking these securities off the bank.
Let us see how that is. When did the bank first obtain security over these mines in Wales ?-It must be as far back, I think, as 1850. Perhaps my solicitor wiUl correct me if I~ amwOng.
Had not the bank i the early part of 1853, made great efforts through Mr. Pinniger, their solicitor, to dispose of the mines 9.-Through Mr. Pinniger. No ; I think not.
Just refer to the minutes, if you please, for the month of March, 1853. Do not you remember the fact that Mr. Pinniger had been employed by the direotors for the purpose of getting u p a public company to take these mines ?-
And that he failed to do so ?-I recollect now what you mnean.
He did not succeed t-Xo.
I believe he was employed because the bank thought, if they employed their own solicitor, it probably might become known, and be detriniental to their interest. Was that considered so?-I should think it was a wise consider. ation.
But, withouLt now questioning its wisdom, was it the fact? -I should think it was.
Is it so ?-Yes.
Now, havin failed in that, they made arrangements, I believe, with a W. Clark to work these mines ?- Yes.
I tinkhe emanedin ossssin fr smemonths, and they were then thrown back again upon the hands of the ban 1Finin heha no eoug cpitl,hethrew them however, they vrere thrown back again upon the hands of
No,in the year 1854, I believe you instructed Mr. Fuller tos these mines?-He had instructions, but whether in 1854 I do not know.
Now, refer to the minute of the 27th of June, 1854, and see whether at that time the directors came to a resolution with reference to the reserved price of the mines. Were you present at the meeting ?-No, I was not.
Bat you were aware of it ?-Yes.
You find on the 27th of June, 1854, at the meeting of the Court of Directors "the Court having considered the question as to the amnounit of the reserved bidding to be put upon the Welih Works at the Auction Mart to-morrow, and as to the amount of the purchase money which might be left as a security for the property, and having conferred thereon, it was resolved that the reserved bidding on the Park property sghould be 40,0001., and the reserved bidding on the Works 30,0001., and that half of the purchase money might, if required, remain on security of the property." At that time the directors, I assume, believed that 40,0001. and 30,0001., making together 70,0001., was aU that they would be lkely to get for the mines by sale ?-That is so.
There was no bidder, I believe, at that sale ?-No open bidder.
That is very much like no bidder at al ?-That was the result.
I believe the security given to the bank was to a limit of 50,0001. -I believe it was originally.
Can you tell me whether it is or not correct that at that time the bank had advanced upwards of 75,0001. upon the property?-No, certainly not. I should think it is incorrect.
Now, tell me, did not Mr. Apeley Pellatt and Mr. Pearce retire from the direction of the bank in consequence of what they considered the irregularity of the transactions with reference to the mines ?-Not to my knowledge. The grounds of their retirement were quite different.
Perhaps you will favour us with those grounds7?-hr. Apsley Pellatt had acted as a member of the London Life Assurance-office, to which he gave a good deal of time. Mr. Pearce was actively engaged at Iloyd's, and they found their engagements were incompatible with the duties which the bankdemanded.
I need scarcely ask you again whether, in the month of May, 1855, you had not yourself come to the conclusion that there would be a very large loss about the Welsh mines ?-We were sanguine that we should be successful in forming a company to take them off the hands of the bank upon the principle of deferred payment, by issuing to any public body who would be disposed to take the securities.
Tell me what means you had taken for the purpose of gettingupany such limited liability company?-We had been in communication with a professional man, who said he thought he could manage it for us.
Give me his name, if you please.-Mr. Walker. He osaid he thought he had connexions of suffioient power to enable him to construct it.
Wbat Mr. Walker was that 7-A lawyer. Where does he live 9-I do not know.
Is he in London?-He[was quite a young professional mnan.
Does he reside in London ?-I believe so.
Where is he to be found ?-He was originally connected with our solicitor.
Where ishbe to be founad-At the present moment I do not know. You will find aminute upon the subject.
Mr. LnxLATER.-ir. Paddison can help us. Is he tobe got at, Mr. Paddison 9
Mr. PADDisoN.-Oh, yes.
Witness.-He thought he had access to a number of wealthy persons of position-I do not feel at liberty to name them-whom he thought migbt be disposed to take up the whole thing through the strength of their own con. nexions.
I am afraid we must trouble you for their names, as we may hereafter have to test, not the accuracy of what you are now saying, but your memory.-I do not think it would be right for me to give the names to be brought before a public meeting, nor do I see the importance of it.
Mr. IJNLATXR (to the Commissioner).-I am quite in the judgmenr of the Court upon the subject.
The CoiMissioNER.-It is not very materiaL Witness.-With due deference, I think not.
Mr. LrLAvIntdt.-It had been put up to auction in 1854 ?-When I stated that we were m hopes of-
The ComnisSsioNzEn-. suppose there were some subseuent endeavoursalso-I did not absolutely dive into that. We thought that, though that particular iustrumentalt
maight fail, others would turn up advantageously, which would enable us to carry out our view, because a time might come more favourably for the constrmction of a company upon this principle. I did not place such faith upon his particular instrumentality. He said, "I know So-and-so and So-and-so, and I c-an get acces's to parties who, I think, wil be likely menuto take the thing up." w
Mr. LlNl;LATEsa.-When was that ?-Some time, Isuppose, before 1856.
Mr. PADDnssoN.-As you have applied to me upon the subject, and as Mr. Esdaile has himself stated thateMr. Walker was, he believed, connected with the bank solicitors, just permit me to state all that I know upon the subject. Mr. Walker was a clerk of mine inthe year 1854, for nine months. He left me at the end of thosemnine months, and from that time afterwards to July or August, 1856, I never saw or heard of Mr. Walker, but in either July or August, 1856, or some day which can be got at through a minute you will find in the minute-book of the proceedings of the directors, it was sated to me incidentally that Mr. Walker had been employed by the directors for the purpose of getting up a company to purchase thtose Welsh works; but as to the negotiations with Mr. Walker, as to the peculiar i-u-entaL;t through which he was employed, as to any interviel wit
him upon the subject, I know nothing.
Witness.-He was introduced to me by Mr. Crawford our new manager.
Mr. PDDInSON.-[Ee heard of the employment of Mr. Walker from information which had been given to him.
Mfr. IArNLATER.-I must ask you when was it that you had communication with Mr. Walker upon the subject of, this company ?-Juno or July.
June or July ?-Quite a late period.
Perhaps at the same moment at which the bank closed ? -No, I should think not.
Had not a Mr. Thomson been employed by the directors ? -Yes, he was a civil-engineer.
A civil engineer. He was, and had been employed for what purpose ?-The management.
Had not he given it up as a hopeless task ?-No; he gave it up because it did not afford-I believe those were his words-sufficent scope for his enterprise, I believe he wanted to go into the iron trade and the coal trade.
When did he give it up?-I do not know-1854, I suppose. His letter exists, which will give you these paticulars.
Just see, Mr. Esdaile, whether this minute of the 29th of August, 1856, will refresh your memory as to the time when you had communication with Mr Walker. I find by the minute of that day, the 29th of August, that the solicitor sted he only heard yesterday that Mr. Francis Walker had been instructed by the Court to form a compauy for taking the Welsh works, and obeerved that this had been done without hbis privity, and without asking his advice upon the subject, contrary to the conduot of the Court upon the two former inatancew ihr which Mr. Punnager in 1853 and Mr. Venunig rcntly in 1856 had been employed for some purps. Tle pngra i7ef ager stated-that the dispol of the r Works bnead san fr thee -srsPaddixonjs hand, andit waitim&
to try some one else. The soliCitor denido the truth of the general manager's atatement, and asserted tilat it was well.
nown to all but the new 'directors that it bad been the policy of the bank up to that time to avoid putting forward their own solicitor in any attempt so form a company, in order that the bank connexion with the works might not be cnown. Now, that minute is igned by yourself, as governor ?-Yes.
And it correctly reports what took place ?-Yes.
Now, does that enable you to say whether or not your communication with Mr. Walker took place at the end of the month of August last year ?-I should think probably at the end of July. There were one or two other negotia. tions pending at that time.
Do I understand you now to say that you represented that which you believed to be true when, in the accounts ending Juno, 1856, you stated the Welsh works to be a good asset to the amount of 120,0001. ?-Weilt we did feel and we were prepared to say that the eventualities would be such as to produce a loss to the bank upon that.
I do not want to interfere with the exercise of all the eloquence of your voabulary, but I want an answer " Yes" or ' No." Do I understand you to represent that yoa believed youwere stating the truth when in theaccounts ending the 30th of June, 1856, you represented to the shaTeholders that the Welsh mines constituted an available asset of the value of 120,0001.? It is a plain question, and let me have an answer, yes or no 7-It is not a question that I can give a plain answerto. We mayhave, and mubt havehad of course, certain anxious feelings with regard to what the future would bring about as to that property, but we were not prepared to say that there would be a loss before that loss was proved. Ithereforecannotgiveyoua yesornoanswer. I can only give you such an answer as is present to my own mind.
I must ask you, Mr. Wsdaile, upon the obligation of the oLth you have taken, whether on the 30th of June, 1856, you believed the Welsh mines to be of the value of 120,0001. ? Do not hesitate so long.-I am obliged to hesitate because at that time we were in confident hopes that we might make arrangements by which the property would be redeemed-that those advances would be redeemed.
Had not Mr. Donally been in communication with the bank with reference to the sale of these mines?-Years before.
What do you call years before-1855 ?-No; 1852. Mr. PADnisoN.-1852 or 1853.
Witness.-The mines had not been developeed at all, because we had not laid our railway down. We had not opened our slips, or extanded our cutting and other things. Tne property was in a very indifferent state.
MIr. LnMKs.%Tm-I will ask you until I get an answer. Doyou or do you not believe that you were makidn a honest representation to the shareholders in teling them that the Velsh mines were an available asset to the amount of 120,000L .-I can only make the same answer that I miade before.
With that answer I arm not satisfied ?-I cannot give you any other. I can only say that at that time we did not believe among ourselves that there would be a loss upon that property. There is no question as to its lost power of developement.
The Co2rnuissxoNBR.-You would have sold it for 53,000!. if you could ?-But since that time we have done a good deal. We made a very large extra outlay upon it.
After 1854 ?-In fact, the principal outlay was subsequent to that period.
Subsequent to the expected sale by Messrs. Fuller ?
-Yes. ?erhaps while we are upon that property it may be considered germane to the question to say that the value of the mineral property depended almost entirely upon the railway communication we could make to it. Had we succeeded, which we fully anticipated doing, in introducing our coke fairly to some of the lea4ing railways, I think that there were the elements of redemption on that account, and, indeed, it is that feeling, Mr. Linklater which makes me hesitate to give you a straightforward answe r,which you think I am shirking, which is no suc h g. I repeat it, the coal was of great value for railway purposes, and, had we been in a position to havo opened a free access to the Great Western, the South Devon, or to the South Wales, or even to run up to the Midland, such a new and important feature would have been impressed upon the wholo thing that I do believe, and we beheved up to that very time, within a week of our stop. page, that there would be the chance of ultimate realization, and therefore you must not press me to say whether I am prepared to admit that. We were making an honest stat-ement.
I shall be happy to give you every opportunity for explanation, but must again put the question to youa ?-I cannot give it to you otherwise than that I believed, as an honest man, there were chances upon the cards for us. You must remember, Mr. Linklater, it was only owing to the attacks of certain members of the press upon the bank subsequent to that half-yearly meeting that the confidence of our shareholders was seriously impaired, and through them the confidence of our public depositors. Up to the period of that half-yearly meeting we were in hopes-and I wish this to go forth most distinctly,-we were In hopes, with ournew management, with our new position, with the vastly improved scale of business, and with improved con. fidence, that we might have worked through our difficulties, knowing what other institutions have done. We are not the only ones who have had ye serious blots to face in the early stages of their existence, but we are the onlyones that thathas en fatened upon. 1 will not give you the name; it is at my tongue's end.
I am not quite sure that the thanks of the community are not due to the caue of the stoppage of the bank ?-That may be so in the result. It might have created great mischief otherwise.
I wil ask you again, and I will have an answer to my question-I ask you, when you calculated the assets of the bank, and included in the welsh mines that 120,0001., whether you believed you were making an honest representation to the shareholders in this bank ?-We made the only representation we could make under the circumstances.
Id you believe that you were making an honest representation to the shareholders of the bank.9-We believed that, as holders of security of that description, we were saying
what the management o any other similar institution under the same circumstances would have done.
Did you believe you were making an honest representation to the shareholders of the bank 7-I can put my auswer in no other form.
The ConaDssiowi-You. could not have believed it to be an available asset at the time?-Certainly not. If Mr. Linldater wishes me to confine myself to that form I meet him at once and say it could not be an available amst.
Mr. LiNKLATER.-No, you may attempt to escape me vith that form of answer. I have now the report before me vhich staes the assets thus :-Assets by loans on convertible securities for short periods advanced on cash credit accounts, balance, discount, &c.; included in that item were the Welsh works, at 120,0001. I repeat my question
ThReu. Co3rIssioNxR-That comes under the &c.
Mr. IANKLiTEP.-Yes. I repeat my question to you, and I ask whether, including the Welsh mines in that item of 120,0001., you believe you were makmng an honest representation to the sbareholdersl-I can say no more than Ihbave.
Until I am told that I am not entitled to an answer I will repeat the question to you. I ask you as an honest man, now answering upon your oath ?
The COMassiOx -Was it true that you had assets to that amount for money advanced on those different securities-that you had asseis to that large amount?We had assets to that amount of various kinds. Many of them, of course, were not available.
The Com3iminoxic .-Those Welsh works-could only have been available by some very fortunate and lucky circumstance happening afterwards; at some futume period lt would have taken some time to develone the thing. I presume yoa could not have got 120,0001. for it ?
IMr. Ln,LATMx-I will ask you the question in another form. Did you not, on the 20th of June, 1856, fear that the bank would lose upwards of 50,0001. by these means ?-Fear that they might?
Yes ?-Yes, we did. We might have thought if our after exertious were not sa-ceessful that serious loss would result. We had had that bafore us for a long time.
Did not you fear that the bank would loa, upwards of 70,0001. by those means ?-Certainly not.
But between 50,0001. and 70,0001. ?-Yes ; there is no use mentionigmany particular sum. I believed that if we did not succeed under the altered state of the money-market in carrying forward a negotiation which would relieve the bank of these securities a very serious loss would be involved. There could be no question about that, and I think that is the only way I can put my answer to that broad question.
While we are upon that question I will ask you another question. The balance-sheet Up to the 30th of June, 1856, submitted by the Court of Directors to the proprietors of the general meeting assembled on Friday, the Ist of August, 1856, represented that the bank was solvent did it not? Is not that so?7-Yes. I presnme you will say that was the inference to be drawn from the statement.
I I6ask} ytou whether you did not know on the 30th of June, 16, that thebankwasna state of hopeless insolvency?
Yes,ouqknew ?-I decline to give you yes or no to that
parti question.~ ~ ~~~~aten Letme, before you answer that question, recall your atten
tion to some of the accounts of this bauk.-No; I knowr
Then I need not do more than this. I will call your attention to the Welsh Works, to Mr. Mullen's account, to Mr. Cameron's account, to the Islington Cattle Market account, to Mr. Humphrey Brown's account, to Mr. Gwynn's account, and overdue bills acoount. And, now, I ask you upon the oath you have taken whether you did not know on the 30th of June, 1856, tha& this bank was in a state of hopeless insolvency?-Of course
it is mpossible to say that it Was not insolvent to our own conceptions. Are you going to draw this conclusion, that a public meeting or a corporation are to place no reliance at all upon future efforts to redeem their position when it is or might become an unsound one? It was that which buoyed us up for a long time. We felt
whethnr right or wrong, justffied or not, with this impressmin, that on one side we had a burden intolerable to bear, as you may suppose, the shareholders' interesi
weighing upon the action oft he directors; and on the other hand we were, perhaps, too greatly sangtine in relying upon the redeemint cirCumstance of the future and the enlargement of our DusineSS, the augmentation of capital, and the greater strength of the indtitution to PUt us into a position which should have prevented t e frightful ruin which has been percipitated upon us; and it wasunder those most painful and narrowing circumstaaiw that we have done what we have.
I ask you whether you were not well aware, on the 30th of June, 1856, that the whole of the subscribed capital, o- rather of the paid-up cpital, had been lost ?-I eannot deny but that we had tho belief that it was in jeopardy, but at the same tihe we lent up the future.
My qUestion is not " in jeopardy," but lost.-No, I think youmustnotsayso. Jeannotsky so ihil *ebelievedw5 had the ahauce of, redeeming out Welsh property, and while we

Did M[r. Harriaon succeed in France against the proceed ings of the ba:k?-Yes, in the French courts, but he is amenable to us in England.
I intend to ak you another question, and I warn you that I will folowr you through ewah detail of tbat item, amounting to 810,2041, and as:k you now, whether you wiiU pledge your oath that you believed that item represented value exceeding 600,000L ?-I am not able to say to what extent I believe that had exceeded the amount which we might beheve would be reaized.
Am I far out when I say that it ought to beles thmn
,C00L as a fair representation to the shareholders?Well, I think youa*re wrong in that. I think not.
How much out ?-It so entirety depended upon our estimate at the time of what weo were going to reaLize upon these large securities. Of course, the deficiency now comes upon us in a very aggravated form, because all hope of recovr is gone.
You have told me that you knew the various accounts. Do you know the details comprising that large item of 810,000w ?-No, I do not say that I do.
To a great extent do you?7-Yes.
I ask you whether, as between the directors and the sharebolders, it was fair to represent that as an item to the amount of 600,0001. 9-Yes, we believei in the result that it certainly was, but to what extent I am not prepared to say.
You became governor in February, 1855. 1 ask you vwhether the statement contained in the accounts laid before the general meeting of shareholders in Februsry, 1856, was true or false?-Of course it is no use my saying that it did not give an impression which, in point of fact, was erroneoas. That is not saying bat that we as a managing body were buoyed up by hopes of our own.
I ask you whether you, as governor, did not sanction these accounts knowing them to be false? Out with it. I must have your answer, yes or no, to that question * it is a very pLain one to a man intending to answer honestly. I will repeat it if you do not understand it. I ask you whether you did not know that the accounts preaented to the shareholders in February, 1856, were false 9-I cannot answer the question in that decided way.
It may be unpleasant to you, but an answer I must have. -I mnow that many figures were open to a great deal of doubt.
The question is still unanswered.-I should like to guard my answer to that with a great deal of caution. I cannot give a "Yes" or "No" answer. In fact, we may have mnown that the figures bore a wrong imnpression, but in spirit, with our intentious towards the bank, we might have been perfectly honest inputting that statement before the public.
Such refinement I confess I am unable to comprehend. I must ask you again the question whether the accounts rendered to the shareholders in February, 1856, were not to your knowledge false?
The CoairissioNXE-The figures in that account are not represented as being matter of doubt at all, are they ?
air. LmmLATms.-No, Sir.
The ComsasioN-m-f you knew they were matter of doubt, why did you not represent them as beiDg matter of doubt?
Mr. LrNLATT-On the contrary, the language of the report holds out the prospects of the bank as improving and thriving. Most miserable I-Only from that most difflcalt position in which we found ourselves, with heavy responsibilities hanging upon us on the one side, and, I say again, buoyed up by hopes upon the other, we were, therefore, not prepared at once to realize the ruin which a more explicit statementwouldhave immediatelybrought downupon nS; and surely much allowance is to be made for theposition of men with very proper and honourable intention to those whose intctest they had at heart. The difficulty was thiswere we now at once to realize this to our shareholders, or verewe still to givethe bank-the corporationwhich we were managmg-the chance of a aore favourable future. With our mmds poised between those two conflicting classes of meotives, we hesitated certainly to show all our debts upon that statement, and our anxiety and fears, knowing that we should bring down upon us the very evil that we were so anxious and desirous to stave off.
Do I understand you by that lengthened explanation to mean this-that, in your desire?
Witness-Pardon me, it is a gross way of putting it It is chargmg me as a gentleman with wilfully telling an untruth. I wlll not and I cannot subscribe to it. MY natmue tells me it is foreign to that intention, and therefore I will not subscribe to it.
Your answer is almost lost in the many words you use to express this. Do I understand rightly that, by your lengthened explanation, you intand to convey to the Court that your anxiety to protect the interest of the shareholders led you to send forth accounts which werefalse v-They were not strictly to be justified by fact,
They were not truel-Put it in another way.
Mr. ComiurssioNxs-Are you not justified by fact? Put it in another way.
Mr. Lzi.ATLrmi.-I would rather, and I think the creditors would rather, that Mr. Esdaile should be called upon to answer yes or no. Do I understand you to say that, in vour anxiety to protect the interests of the shareholders, yousent forth, in the month of February, 1856, accounts that were false? That is my question.-Mr. Commissioner Holroyd, is that a fair question to be put to me without my tolicitor being at my eloow 2 It is a painful question to put to a man, As you know.
The Co5anssio-Nm-It is the same thing as you have already said. You say the accounts which were submitted to the shareholders were not justified by the fact. If they were not justified by the fact they were not true. If they were =ot true they were false. He is only putting it in di!ferent words. It might have been done through what you bave stated-over-anxiety, and underthe burden of the difficult position that you were in, in the hope of retrieving yourself.
The Witness-If you wilallowv me to put an answer in that form I have no objection to its being so recorded.
The CoNr3nmIoNxR.-You may give any explanation, of course. If you say the accounts represented to the shareholders were not justified bythe fact-that is, they were not in fact true, but the reason that operated upon your mind in giving those accounts to the shareholders were so and so; that is, that you were induced to do so in the hope of retrieving yourself, and this mine becoming more advantageous.
Mr. LUMLATI -Do you adopt the languago of the Court as your answer ?-Yes, I do.
Mr. LmxLTEBx-Then I will not pres it further. I find that the account presented on the 1st of Augus', 1856, and terminating on the 39th of June, 1856, states that the gross balance-that would be a profit of the half-year ending the 30th of June, 1856, after making provision for had debts and paying interest on 14,856 ls, lLd. on deposits and promissory notes-the balance was 15,0691.i15s. 6d. Was It true or not that there was any profit made upon the trading of that bank during the year over which that account extended ?-We believed so upon the statement of our accountant.
Did you believe it? I ask you, do you believe it, having regard to the fact that it is after making provision for had debts 9-Makin guch previsions as we deemed under the circumstances of the bank were advisable.
Did you not know that debts to the amount of upwards of 100,0001. were utterly bad that were taken in that account as good assets?-You mean to say, including advances to
diectors?
Did you not know that debts to the amount of 100,0001 hat were utterly bad were included in that account as good assets ?-I am not prepared to say what amount was included.
Very well, near it ?-You see we believed that, whilo we were adding certain sums to the reserved fund and a moderate amount to the bad debt fund, after having increased our capital and taken advantage of the larger margin of loss which under the cbarter the increasd capital allowed, yet by degrees we should raise such a hedge s would absorb those losses, but which we were not prepared immediately to realize.
But, with reference to the representation in the report, it was untrne?-Well, it certainly would not be borne out by an analysis of the past due paper of the bank.
Did you believe you had made a sufficient deduction for bad debts when you rendered that account ?-No; but we believed that we were making such a deduction as in the course of years would accumulate, At this moment I should make this remark-we did not conceive it fair that, for a young bank upon very limited capital, exposed as we were to be placed in that way-we did not think it fair that the early years of this bank should be known-I mean in commercial fairness, in banking fairness that it should be loaded with a loss under the head of past due obligations that came upon it, and therefore we believed we were justified in easing the burdens while the bank was in its younDg state.
The CoarazxSSroixss.-Tat is, you wanted to throw the present lOSF upon a future generation 7-Yes, that was our
Mr. LINKLATER.-That is to say, it was robbing Peter to pay Paul 9-It would not have been so if there had been no robbery in the end, as unfortunately there was.
Now, I ask you again whether there are any in that item of 810,0001. debts incleded as good assets which to a very large amount had been bad for years a-Begarded as doubtful. We only recovered 1o,0001. of those within the last
I ask you whether there is not a large amount of debts included in that item of 810,0001 as good debts which were hopelessly irrecoverable and bad?-A large amount there was certainly, but they will be subject to my previous remarks with regard to the insertion of the clause having reference'to the provision for bad debts 4 we left them there in the hope of gradually covering them up
Do I understand you to say that, knowing them to be bad, rou put them there as good, intending to e_tend them over.future accounts?-Yes At all events, that is the way that our acountant treated them.
Aye, ae; and whtch you adopted?-Yes.
Now, I will ask you whether many of those debts had not been bad for years? Mind, I have them all in the books.-MAny of them would go against oar reserved fend, many of those that were bad.
Will you or will you not answer me this ? that sum is not included in the sum of 810,0001. Here you see, after deducting your bad debts you make your allowance for bad debts. That has nothing todo with your reserved fund?We never stated we had made a provision for bad debts deuate to cover al that were bad upon the books of the b%rc
No, you would not do such a thing; but what I ask you Is this again. Were not many of the debts which in that itemu of 810,000l are represented as good-were not those debts which hadhbeen bad and were known to be bad of course iacluded ? I will have an answrer to that qu,estion.- I am bound to admit that, *aubject to the same explantion, it must have been so as * matter of fact.
I ask you whether there are not Included in that item of 810,0001. large sums for interest calculated upon thos debta that were paid ?-No; I tlink not.
Will you swear it?-In that slnthem wa interesteal
eulhted upon advances upon our Welsh nines, but I thintk ttot pon pat duehbills that were caleuateds Irrecoverable. I Ihk that if Mr. Crawford is here he willtellyouthst Yohutr interet up of demarWetionhe wmade.- t h a - ha Your iutmt uponL your Welsh works during tbat lul
liev the bank to be in a shta of insolvency?-! hav e. already said with what rostrictions and qualifioatlons I admit that. We had great responsibilities and angUina hopes; between the two you asy suppose wo weao in a most panful position. I
Do I underatind yota to say that the other directors hoA the same apprehensions with reference to the position of the bank at that time ?-I do not knowr howr far I *m prepare
to ay that; I d- not knowr that Mr. Alderman Kennedr hind -perhaps he had. I think he bad. I do not thin1 the xame amount of apprehension n3 in my mind existod in Mr. Alderman Kepnedy's.
Do I understand you to say you believed Mr. Alderma Kennedy h.d not the extent of information-with reforenoe to tho alaira of the bank that you had yourself ?-Yes, I think so; at all events he bad not tho same apprehensions.
Do you believe bMr. Alderman lKennedy did not &ppre. bend in the month of February, 1855, that the bank was in astato of insolvency ?-I do not know that I can go so f a that.
Your means of knowledge will be the next question. Who wus the deputy-governor in March, 1855?-Mr. Osborne Spens,
I ask you, had you or had you not in MEarch, 1855, hewad from Mr. Spens that he, like yourself, was doubtful of the '.'mtmou of theba " S a have th. tie of that bank.-I think Mr. Spens may havo bs-
Icannot say that I recollet the circumstance. It is not improbable he may have expressed his doubts
Before the Ist of January, 1856, had you any conversation ith Er. Sp,ens, Mr. Cochranoe r. Alderman Kenned-, Mr. Humpnroy Brown, Mr. it'Cieod, Mr. Owen, and hlr 'Vallant with reference to the solvency of the bank'?-I dare say I had constantly indulged in an expression of anxiety with regard to the poition of affalr3,-it is very likel.
Was it in conversation betwoen you and any of those gentlemen suggested that the bank was in a state og ia. solvency .-Suggested'? I do not know that l can say ss.
Was it not before January, 1856, a frequent subject oc conversation at tmetings of directors that the bank was in a state of insolvency?-No, I should say not; although as you may suppose, with a large investment of Inueral property hang'ng over us, non which we wei- ancertain whether there would la a large loss oXnot
what could have been more natural than for us h e:res oar apprehensions to one another ? Again, Vhen we found khat Mr. Humphrey Brown's shipping securities wera not coming up to the valaes placed upon them by our, own broker, we became, of course, anxious upon that sabject and I have no ubt from time to time we expre3sea those anxieties. You may take that for granted. So agair as to Mir. Cameton; when wo found a difficalty in extract. mngadequate securities for those advances.
I-era not the new shares issued at a premium '-I think they were-the first of them. Yes.
And that by direction of the Court of Directors s-Yes,
Mr. LINKLATER.-I believe that 3fr. Eidaile will require to look into some of the details of these accounts in order to enable him to answer the questions which I shall now have to put to him with reference to that large item, and it might be unfair to him withoat having notice of that previously. I shall therefore ask your Honour to be kind enough to djourn for the present.
The case was then adjourned till Wednesday next at 11 o'clock.
(Bcfore Mr. Comsn sioncr Gouu1uTmB.) IN RE SYEss, WALKER, AND SYERS.
A dividend ineeting was held under the estate of these bankrupts described as of Great Ball Alley, Lombard-street.
Mr Lawrence, Mr. Chidley, and other gentlemen an. peared for creditors; Mr. Linklater represented tfie assignees
]Ur. GREEN, on behalf of the assignees of W. 0. Tucker, a bankrapt, sought to enter a claim for 5,1181.. aghinst the estate.
Mr. LAWRVRErNCE opposed the admission of the claim.
It appeasing that the account would require examination. by the official amsignee, it was arranged that the claim should ho admitted nunC pro tuinc, gr. Nicholson to go through the matter, and to report as to the correctness of the figures.
In answer to his Honour Mr. NicnoissoNz stated that the fund available for division among the creditors was now about 8,0001.
W RE sHARTZ.
This was a certificate meeting. The bankrupt was described as a merchant, &c., of Mark-lane, also trading as Crews and Co.
Mr. George appeared for the assignees.
Mr. LAWvRENxCE supported, and said that certain of his client's creditors were so far pleased with his conduct as to intmst him with the dividend warrants they had received, for the purpose of enabling him to recommence trade. The amnount thus relinqubhed exceeded 3,0001., only one creditor retaining the dividend.
His HONOUR, in giving judgment, said that he never remembered a case during the whole titme he had sat at that court where the creditors of a bankrupt had come forward as Mr. Lawrence had mentioned. He had much pleasure in accedig to their wishes by granting a first-class certificate to which be thought the bankrupt was well entitled.
First-class certificate accordingly.
(Beforc Mr. C rmmissioner FONBLANQUE.)
IN RE GEORGE DASBY.
The bankrupt was described a3 a wine merchant of Watford. He now applied for a certificate.
Mr. Chidley appeared for the assignees and did not oppose.
A common certificate was granted.
Great Fire In Fleet-Street.
GBREAT FIRE IN FLEET STREET.
Iast night, shortly before 9 o'clock, a fire, attended with a loss of property roughly estimated at nearly 30,0001.
took place in the premises belongung to Messrs. Perkins, Bacon, and Bache, steel plate engravers to the Government and manufacturers of the postage and receipt stamps' situate in Whitefriars-street, and extending in one direction to the back of the buildings in Fleet-street, while others in Hanging-sword-alley and Crown-court abutted. The factory was at the least 120 feet wide and from 60 to 70 feet high. The upper floors contained a great number of heavy machines and dies of great value, as weU as a miscellaneous stock of costly papers. Without a moment's delay the poHoe on duty gave an alarm and sent off for the services of the Royal Society's escapes and the engines. With as little delay as possible the engines of the parish and several of the London Brigade, together with that of the West of England Insurance-office, came uin rapid succemsion, and a bonntiful supply of the New River Company's water having been procured, the whole of the engines were called into operation; but in spite of the exertions of the firemen present, and the many tons' weight of water thrown by the land engines upon the conflagration, it continued its ravages, and, in order to save the housep in Hanging-sword-alley, Crown-court, and the adjoining presmises, Mr. Braidvood ordered the large steam floating engine to be bronght to the water's edge, and by setting bothengines into fulloperationtremendous streams were cast upon and into the blazing premises, but even that had yer htleeffect in subduing the fire.
Shortly after 12 o'clock the air vessel of the steam-float gave way, owing to the back pressure of the valves, and threw the cap and vessel of copper which covered it upon the deck, whence, rebounding, it feU into the river. This of course prevented the engine from being of any further asistance.
By half-past 12 at midnight the land engines managed to get the fire under their command, but not until the premises and all they contained were for the most part destroycd, it is understood that the principal sufferers were nsured. The police, under Inspectors Mitchell and Shelfo'd, rendered great assistance to the firemen by keeping the crowd out of danger.

DBFINmON OF A "BONA FIDE" TiRAVELLER.- An interlocutor and note have been pronounced by the learned Sheriff Substitute of Argyllshire, Mr. John Idaolaurin, in the actions of damages at theinstance of two spirit dealers in Glasgow, travellers by the Emperor steamer on Sunday, against twlo hotel keepers in Dunoon, for refusing admitandce to their hotels on Sunday, in consequence,Was the inukeepers stated, of their being ordered by the local justices to refuse admitance to al travellers by the Xmperor steamner on Sunday, ander pain of losing their licensse The case came before tha Small Debts Court at D)unoon in October last, and wvas remitted to the ordinary tosrt 1te damages and expenset wseremno awarded. The interlocutor finds thst the defender, by refusing accommod dation and refreshment to the pursuer, acted illegally and nwavrrantably, and to the injury and damae of the pursuer and that the pursner is entitled to reparation on account of the aid act of refusal on the part of the defeuder. In his note the Sheriff says,-" Assuming that all travellers by this conYeyance avere solely bent on amusement, a publicas
would nevertheless be bound to afford eacommodation
ind rfrefshment to any passenger therein tho had trave,ied 30 miles It is, impossible, however, to hold that all the parties wgho travel by the public conveyance heocrredto travel exclusively for amusement or pleasure. They may have urgea t and necessitou8 reasons for isitinrt ftiends and relatives at the different towens on the irtho
wlide, either arisiub at the moment, or thom they could not possibly see duoring other days of the week. They may have occasion fth necessity to *rave1 On Sunday for the benefit of health, which various circumstances may prevent the possibility oF their doing on any other day. lt consist
w vith the Sheriff*snbstitute's knowledge that the superintendent of police, several criminal offlcers, andotherofficiala connected with the c ounty, have in cases of urgent public duty availed thewselves of a conveyance by the Emperor steamer on more occasions than one upon a Sunday. In these circumstancesN aud while no objection has ever beem raised against the thourands. of trAvellers who convey them. Felvea on Sunday by means of carriages and saddl, horses, thereby keeping a host of servants occupiedand from church, it is difEcult to see any grounds for fastening exclasively upon the Emperor steamer, the owners of which, so far as th demploynient of servants is concerned, are guilty of nlneh les desecration then those who practlie land travelfing. The defender, however, in arguing the point of d:cr:in, hi
cited the old Scotch Act, 1579, chap. 70, as _ at the eonduct of the pursuer, and entitling the defend( to act *A he did. This statute, like many others on Sabbth desecm, tion, etiaeted in the same century, has long sine. pmbed in'o desuitude, and cib hav, no, force in tw19th cent¶ry/'-. Dafly ZcoWaan,

LONDON, THURSDAY, MARCH 12, 1857.
In the House of Commons yesterday on the *order for the second reading of the Ecclesiastical Corporations Bill,
The Marquis of BLANDFORD, in announcing his intention to withdraw the Bill, explained briefly its general objects-namely, first, to vest the property -of Ecclesiastical C.)rporations in the bands of the Eoclesiastical Commissioners; secondly, to make mIlterior arrangements for the application of the pro , when so transferred, to the providing and lncre endowments. As objections were entertained,' Ze, aid, to leaving the property in the bands. oE the Commissioners, he was ready to reonsider the mesure, aDd see whether he could mneet the views oftho,ewho objected so to leave the property.
After some remarks by Mr. E. DEiNsoN and Mr. WAtP6Lt on the subject of the Eccleaiastical C3om
;isAon theord6r"As discharg6d.
Th.e ddWfor't ie secoid reading of the Imprison mnet for Debt, &c., Bill was moved by Mr. P:-
i.ATr, but after a short disc'si6n the motion was negatived.
The order for the second reading of the Grand Juries (Ireland) Act Amendmen t Bill was discharged.
The House then went into a Committee of Supply on the Civil S-rvice and Revenue Estimates, when certain votes (including a grant for education), were taken on account, after discussion.
On the report upon the Income-ta. Bill,
The CHANCELLoR of the EXcn}QuER gave explanations, first, as to the reasons for the omission of tha word " property" in the original draught of the Bill, which, ho said, was perfectly correct; and se ond, as to the dlifficulttes, suggested by Mr. GLADST.)N'E oni the preceding evening, in the colleetion of the succession duty.
The Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Bill, the Customs Duties Bill, the Indemnity Bill, and the Copyhold and Enclosure Commiissions, &c., Bill passed through committee.
Obher bills were read a second time, and at a quarter past 2 o'clock the House adjourned.
The right hon. member for the University of
The right hon. member for the University of Oxford is in one respect not well suited to his constituency. That which greatly enhances its value in the eyes of ordinary men is a considerable drawback in bis particular instance. Ordinary men would give anything for a seat in which the election costs something under ten guineas a-time, in which you are forbidden to canvass, are not allowed to mal;e a speech, have only to leave your card at the Common Rooms at your leisure, and go to as many dinners, breakfasts, and lunches as you have appetite or time for. Among these recommendations, however, the imposition of silence is a great denial to a gentleman who for volubility of utterance, memory, and calculatinig powers has hardly hiis equal on this side the Alps. Mr. GLADSTO.xE may not address his long-robed electors from a platform of newly-sawn deals, surrounded by a familiar troop of clatee7urs, with rosy D.C.L.'s for his fuglemen, and right hon. baronets to smile blandly on his more sentimental touches. He is denied the auxiliaries of brass bands and strong ale, of processions and banners, and all the vulgar resources on which common men rely, and has not even their chances for displaying his unsurpassed fecundity of political expression. So there was no resource but to do it all in the Commons; and, as far as language could supply the place of hustings, banners, trombones, drums, and ale, Mr. GLADSTONE did on Tuesday evening all that was necessary to secure his election. It is well known that the first thing done by a candidate of the least ingenuity and by his faithful Committee is to appropriate or forestall those war cries that both or all parties might lay equal claim to. In the spirit of the well-known precept, pro2nie communia dicere, you must say what your opponent or anybody ele has as much right to say as yourself in such a way that it shall seem your own. So, wlhen ATHiELSTAN the UNixEADY comes down in the shape of some honest merchant or country gentleman and delivers his sentiments, he finds you in possession of what he thought his strongest points. Accordingly, Mr. GLADSToNE has lost no time,-or, if he has lost twenty-four hours through an imprudent interruption of the First Lord of the Admiralty, he boasts that he has made it up with good interest,-in appropriating for himself and his friends some of the points most likely to tell at the forthcoming election. He has taken the bread out of the mouth of the C m nELLoi of the EXCOEQUER and the whole Administration by claimilg not only the most economical intentions, whiclh everybody claims, but by giving the credulous world to understand that he and his friends have been no party to the increasing expenditure he denounces, and have neither directly nor indirectly contributed to it. This required ingenuity as well as courage, but Mr. GL.DSTONn lacks neither.
The electioneering license of the address which, for want of hustings or the balcony of the Blue Boar, Mr. GLADSTONE has published through the vehicle of Parliament, may be seen from a few specimens. In the first place, he proposes to a House which is only to last a fortnight, and which is only asked to grant some money on account-just enough to last till May,-to pronounce that "it is necessary
to revise and further reduce the expenditure of the State;" tliis, too, without even the intention of going to a division, or so producing any public result. Then, he is urged, he says, to this fruitless course by the deep regret and the conviction he feels that we are entering on a mischievous course, of which before long we shall regret the consequences. The mischievous course he proves abundantly, but he omits to inform the mob below that his proof ex tends over a period of at least four years, during two of which Mr. GLADsToNEs himself was Chancellor of the Exchequer; that during the last two years the Opposition, and even some of his own friends, have connived at this extravagant tendency; and that some of his own most elaborate attempts at economy have not had the happiest results. Apnpos of one of these failures, the proposition to appropriateaspecific portion of the Income-tax to the purpose of redeeming Mr. GLADSTONE'S 6,000,0001. Exchequer-bonds is evidently addressed to the "groundlings," and comes with singular propriety from a financier who the other day called Sir G. C. Lvwis all the names he could think of for keeping the income-tax at 7d. instead of lowering it to 5d. But nothing drowns memory so much as noise, and a man of Mr. GLADSTONE'S eloquence can always make one nail drive out another by what may be called oratorical percussion. The CHANcELoR of the ExoHEQOER, he then says, has left the country in the lurch; he has not made adequate provision for the necessities of the year, still less for the next year. As matters now stand, no increase of the Sugar and Tea Duties or of the Income-tax is proposed for the year after next, or the year after that, up to 1860. As Mr. GLADSTONE penetrates into the future he is startled and amazed. He can hardly believe his eyes as he computes our growing insolvency, and is not surprised to find the CHANCca.aon of the EXOnEQUER providing a retreat by postponing a sinlking fund till there is money for it. As far as this horror and amazement bear on the taxes adopted or proposed, they are about as gratuitous as the dismay a madman might possibly feel at not seeing on the dinner-table enough to last him for the rest of his life. Lord PALm.ERSTON, having been thrown into a minority, consulted his own feelings of honour and constitutional usage by announcing a dissolution at the shortest possible date. It became necesary then to confine financial propositions not only to one year, but, as far as possible, to the period sufficient for the assembling of a new Parliament. Sir G. C. LEawis has made ample provision for that period, and, as far as the House of Commons was lkely to permit him, for the whole year beginning next month. So far from Mr. GLADSTONE being able to deny this, in every single instance in which he has a difference with Sir G. a. L}wsIs his complaint is that the latter is raising too muchmaking too ample provision. Yet partly by putting out of sight for the moment the exigencies of the political crisis, which Mr. GLADSTONE himself has helped to create, and partly by harping with something Tery like. mono-
I ania u-pon future years, i6Wi bcyond Sir G. a I LEpwS', control, he producexs An imentary Miltion
I-hothing in the world but an illtison of tho most
fluih, peophow chamter,-that the CHEA nBLLOR
of the EXoHEQuER is committing us irretrievably to a career of insolvency. The inference whiclt the less informed and less observant portion of the public are to draw from these feats of rhetorical legerdemain is, that the right hon. member for the University of Oxford is the only man to supply the gaps in the present avowedly and inevitably provisional Budget.
It is, however, in Mr. GLADsToNE's remarks upon expenditure that the spirit of appropriation chiefly shows itself. So far from disputing the truth of much that he laments, we have re-. peatedly lamented it before, and Sir G. C. LEwIs made the same laments in his financial statement. It is too true that " the expenditure of
the country has not of late been kept under due "control." That "it has increased to a point "which has become embarrassing, and which "threatens to become, if due control is not ap"plied, even alarming," is either a truism or an exaggeration of the fact; but no doubt we have " of late," that is, for several years past, been very ready to add to the national burdens. It is, however, necessary on a question of moral and political responsibility to be rather more exact than suited Mr. GLADSTONE'Si electioneering purposes. "I believe," he says, " there is only a net increase of 750,0001. "in the charges of the funded and unftmded "debt, taken together, since 1853 ; and therefore " about 5,500,0001. of the total increase is repre"sented by sheer augmentation of expendi"ture independently of the war,-nearly five "millions and a half in four years !" The phrase, " independently of the war," is an equivocation. It is meant to produce a popular idea that the augmentation has arisen from other causes than the war, and is not likely to be counteracted by the cessation of the war. The fact is, by far the greater part has arisen from the alterations and imtprovements found necessary in our naval and military establishments, and is likely to subside gradually, and indeed rapidly, in a state of peace. The experience of the past war shows that the worst economy is not to be prepared, and that it costs more than double to make up for a bad beginning. Then comes another statement not only uncandid but absolutely untruie. "For "fifteen months, practically, we have been aware "that the war is at an end." Peace was not concluded even twelve months ago, and till it was concluded it would have been madness to reduce our Army and Navy at the seat of war, or otherwise act as if all was over. As to the declaration that we cau now do with less Army and Na'ry than we had before the war, that may do very well for the hustings, but every considerable reduction of the national defences has only led to increased expense in the day of need, and no one knows better than Mr. GLADsTON-E, if he only chose to confess it, the result of entering on a great war without an adequate idea of its difficulties and demands.
As to our civil and miscellaneous expenditure, Mr. GLADsroNE would be more entitled to the credit of his very just remarks if he could also show that he and his friends had duly protested on the several occasions of extravagant expenditure. Much of it-nay, most of it-arises from that unhappy division of parties and that utter factiousness which paralyze and degrade the British Legislature. Parties will not unite to defeat a preconcerted attack on the public purse, because they are more jealous of one another than concerned for the common weal. Why did not 3Ir. GLADSTONrE discover in time that the monstrous Ordnance Survey would cost four or five millions, and do little more than provide proprietors with maps of their estates at the public expense? Why do not MIr. GLADSTONE and the other chiefs of factions abate somewlhat from the rigour of their demands, and agree on some plan of National Education that will put an end to the existing substitute, a fast increasing grant-already near a millionunder a comparatively irresponsible system, in aid of all sorts of schools, helping everybody but those who cannot help themselves ? We have done our best, years ago, to press some really general and national system upon Parliament, and that on the very ground, among other grounds, that the present practice led to a formidable expenditure. So it is in the other extravagances alluded to. The House of Commons has of late years been acting with more money than wit, throwing hundreds of thousands broadcast over the country to get over trifling difficulties, always because there is not sufficient patriotism in the House to rally round the Treasury against the provincial or professional marauders who are for ever scheming against it. The Oppositions-and there are half-a-dozen of them-leave Government to protect the public purse, and, as in the present instance, are only too happy to have totrumpet itsweaknessesorits defeats. No doubt this has been the fashion of politicians in all places and times. The noble science of politics would not otherwise be in such iU favour. But is5 Mr. GLADSTONE, then, only a politician? He would not have us think so; but his conduct lately, and not least the speech before us, belie his former professions.
In another part of our impression this morning
In another part of our impression this morning will be found a document commending itself to the reader's notice by a variety of attractions not often combined in a single production of the kind. It offers an insight into the customs and character of one of the most mysterious empires on the face of the globe; it contributes evidence towards the authentication of some most remarkable facts, and, while the subject itself is nothing less than that very population of China with which we are now brought into collision, the writer is none other than that very Sir JoN BownINCG the spirit and policy of whose administration have so recently and so eagerly been discussed. Above all, the information thus conveyed is entirely unconnected with the late rupture or the present situation of our authorities, although the actual date of the document is so recent that its evidence is fresh andcto the point. It is, in fact, a communication made on the 13th of July, 1855-15 months only before the outbreak at Canton-from Sir Jons BOWNING to our REGISTrAu-GENIRAz, in answer to some inquiries respecting the population statistics of the Chinese empire, and is written not in tho tone of an official despatch, but with all the well-known characteristics of free scientific correspondence. It was first published in the Trcaiisactions of tlte China Branwc of the Royal Asiatic Society, and again appears in the Journal of the Statistical Society for the present month. From this periodical we now extract it, with the view of improving our political knowledge by the undesigned testimony of a literary communication.
If the subject of these speculations were any other country than China it is hardly probable that a mere statistical estimate of the numbers of the population could comprise so much general information or open such extraordinary views, but it really seems as if the institutions of the Chinese Empire at the present stage of its existence were determined in a greati measure by the marvellous multiplication of its inhabitants. What has sometimes been predicted of the old kingdoma of Europe appears actually coming to pam in Chim33. Owing to a variety o causesthe fecundity of z the race, the habits pre'ailing, and, perhaps, the unexampled longevity of the State as a political creation-the population
has outgrown the resources of the soiL It has occupied and fertilized every nook and crevice of territory, and has then swarmed from the land to the water, till its ways may be truly defined as amphibious. lfElions of Chinese-more millions, in fact, than were counted in the last census of Great Britain, either derive their support from the water or even pass their lives upon it, insomuch that at Canton alone some 300,000 persons are supposed to dwellwholy upon the river's surface, from sheer inability to find standing-room on the drY ground. The immensity of the demands thus created has carried the common practice of husbandry up to the height and dignity of horticultural science, and caused such an economy of every species of resource as even in these denselypeopled islands we should find it hard to conceive. At the same time, and as if by the operation of the same natural laws which check increase in races below the rank of humanity, the elements of death and destruction assume in China the most terrible power. Infanticide is practised with a shocking kind of system, that tells volumes of the sentiments prevailing. In an old country, said a* political writer, the agriculturist plants trees, in a new one he cuts them down; and by a horrible inversion of custom the Chinese seem to make arrangements for the death of children as other nations do for their lives. We have aU heard of Foundling Hospitals, and of those apertures in the doors where an infant may be deposited when its parents dicharge themselves of its care, but from the receptacles provided for discarded infants in China there is no return. In many parts of the empire, we are told, " there are towers of brick and stone, where "toothless-principaly female-children are "thrown by their parents into a hole made in the "side of the wall." MIore formidable agencies of mortality, however, are described to be at work. Famines destroy whole multitudes, inundations carry away towns with all their inhabitants, hurricanes send the water population to the bottom of the deep, and civil wars cost millions of lives. What is very remarkable is that in this estimate of destructive elements no mention seems to be made or account taken of epidemic disease. We are told of the visitations of HEAVEN, the convulsions of nature, and of the far more deadly work of man himself, but of the ordinary scourges of humanity we hear nothing at all.
It is not, however, alone to these extraordinary features of national physiology that we invite the attention of the reader. It is but just that a public servant whose acts have been called in question should obtain the benefit of such incidental conclusions as a perusal of his own descriptions may carry, nor do we think that the inferences suggested by the paper in question wil be either insignificant or few. We do not stop to point out the acute observation and special inteligence which are evident in every passage of this document, or to insist on the aptitude which such qualifications must necessarily carry with them. What we wish to remark upon is the entire absence of any feeling towards the Chinese which can be thought to partake of hostility or contempt. The tone of thought pervading the communication is rather that of an antiquary or a scholar imbued, perhaps, with more than a due estimate of his subject, and while in no instance is the case against the Chinese aggravated by comment, in many it is mitigated by explanation or argument. Sir Josi relates, with all the minute circumstantiality of professional interest, the laborious exertions of the Chinaman in quest of subsistence, the marvellous irdustry of the fisherman and the husbandman, and the unparalleled economy which hoards every scrap of fertilizing material, and deals with the very fish of the stream in a living state, lest any should remain unsold and be wasted. He adverts with calculating attention to the stream of emigration, and states how two large and productive islands of the Chinese Sea have been won from the aboriginal possessors by the adventurous inhabitants of the main. In describing social customs and institutions diverging from our own he talks of the absence, not of civilization, but of prejudice. He remarks that in marriages, though the disparity of mere social rank is not recoganied, the forbidden degrees of affinity are rigorously observed, and even in the extreme case of infanticide he quotes at length the decrees of the Government and the arguments of philosophers which have been directed against popular depravity. The disregard of life, so revolting to European ideas, provokes nothing from him beyond a bare statement of facts.
Often," says he, " have I seen a corpse under "the table of gamblers-often have I trod over a "putrid body at the threshold of a door ," but he is betrayed into no feeling of indignation. Twice only do any strong expressions escape him-once when speaking of the casualties awaiting Chinese emigrants, and again when referring to the sanguiinary punishments inflicted on offenders. " The "sacrifices of human beings," he says, " by execu"tions alone are frightful. At the moment in "which write it is believed that from 400 to 500 "victims fal daily by the hands of the headsman "in the province of Kwang-tung alone." The province of Kwang-tung is that of which Canton is the capital, and the headsanan in question was provided with his occupation by Commissioner Yxn. It would be strange indeed if the contrast thus afforded should not suggest some presumptions as to the relative culpabilities of the two officers concerned.
We are not surprised that the mass of destitu-
We are not surprised that the mass of destitution which now presses on the metropolis should drive some persons, and our correspondent, "As"; Essr-B- ThCusrnEr," among the number, to complain of the great inequality involved in our swystem of parish Poor-rates. It is, undoubtedly, the fact that the Eastetn parishes of London are overladen with poor, while many of the Western parishes are comparatively without poor. It is, therefore, not surprising if some persons argue that the London Poor-rates ought to be metropolitan, not parochial, on the ground that it is unfair that one palish should be taxed so much more than another for what is a cotmmon burden and should be shared alike by al. This is the proposal of " A-N " EAST-EWD INOUMENT'," though with a qualification appended to it. He says, " Let all the "London Unions be formed into one district for "rating purposes . . . Let the amount be paid to "a treasurer, and let each parish draw for its "relief upon that treasurer." The qualification is, that the amount which a parish draws from the general fund should be limited to so much per head of poor, allowing a margin of 20 per cent. for moro liberal assistance.
The first remark which such a plan suggests is, that it could not possibly be applied to the metropolis without being applied very soon to the whole country. We must be prepared, if we adopt it, to give up our present system of parish Poorrates altogether, and throw the whole poor of England upon a central fund. But are we prepared to do this ? There is, undoubtedly, a good deal to be said for it on the score of abstract justice. To whom do the poor of Liverpool, Manchester, Binningham, or any other overburdened town or district belong? Who owns tl%-.ir a commercial sense-very undesirable piece of property? Is it local property, or is it; fiationat property? tDo the poor of t-he parish of Manchester and the parish of Birmingham belong ia right and equity to those parishes,
or to the whole cuatry? t Of course, a great deal may be laid to show that they belong to the whole country. The whole country benefits by their labour, and therefore it may be argued with great force that their indigence should not be thrown entirely upon the particular place which happens, by the merest chance, to be the place in which this labour resides and in which the manufacture is carried on. The argument which Manchester or Birmingham or any crowded district has against the rest of England is exactly the argument which a parish in the East of London has against a parish in the West of London. If you admit the claim, then, of East as against Wes'b in the metropolis, you must be prepared to admit the claim of the poor-ridden districts of England generally against the more fortunate ones; or, in a word, you must have a national rate.
The great argument against such a rate has been the clear and strong necessity there is for economy in the administration of the Poor Law, while the only motivo for economy on which yon can rely with perfect confidence is the selfish one--L e., people's natural and laudable desire to save their own pockets. Allow the parish to draw its relief-money from a national fund, and you diminish the motivc for economy in exact proportion that you diminish the loss there will be from want of economy; and you diminish this loss in exact proportion to the addition of area over which you spread it, which is in the present instance the whole of England as compared with one parish ; so that what would be a very great loss, were the parish to bear it singly, becomes hardly felt when the parish takes its share of it with the rest of the country. To allow local authoribies, then, to spend national money would be evidently a disastrous course, leading to infinite and boundless waste. Are you to take the administration of the Poor Law, then, out of local hands and transfer it to central 7 lVhat can a Central Board know about local cases and the justice of the claims of parish widows? We do not say that some extension of the area of rating throughout the country might not be substituted with advantage for the present system. There is much to be said in far our of the plan, which has often been suggested, of an unional instead of a parochial rate. There seems to be no reason a priori why the area of rating and of settlement should not be coextensive with the area of management. But this is widely different from the principle of a national rate, or of a metropolitan one, such as we are now discussing. Here is the dilemma, then, which the nation is in, and we hardly think "Ax EAST-END " LEcUr3xsvrT" has yet solved it, though he thinks he has hit on a plan which " would be " an effective check to extravagance, and would " not take the management out of the hands of "the local authorities, wlio are the best judges of "local claims." What is his check? That the amount which the parish draws from the central fund should be limited to so much per 7eId of paupers, allowing a margin. Such a rate, however, though it is a check upon the expenses of the paupers when you have admitted them, is no check at aU upon the number of the paupers you admit. You get so much per head of paupers whether you have few or whether you have many. However inconsiderate and indiscriminate you may be, then, in admitting persons to relief, you arc no loser singly by it, but throw your loss on that account upontbe central fund, and only take your share of it with the country at large.
But, whatever may be said of the argument, it is evident that the country is not yet prepared for such a complete and fundamental change in the system of Poor-rates as the " EASTEX-D LNctl" Bnx&' proposes; for, though he only proposes it in the case of the metropolis, the change there must inevitably only forestall a general measure. Such a change would, in fact, be a revolution in the world of property; it would raise rents in some quarters and lower them in others so enormously that the value of the estates would be wholly changed. Mr. BuTrr-nwonrn, the wellknown bookseler, has, however, puiblished a scheme for " centrically situated Casual Wards or Hos"pices for the reception of the houseless and "vagrant poor of London," to be supported "by an annual quota from each 3Metropolitan "Union," which is not open to these objections, involving as it does no interference with the principle of parochial rating. Such a plan would, doubtless, prevent a great deal of misery, aud this more effective and more systematic relief would also have the very good result of taking the assistance of the vagrant class still more out of private hands and transferring it to the public. The reason why charitable persons pass by street beggars without any scruple of conscience is, because they ;now that every man and woman in this country can obtain relief in the proper quarter if they apply and are found to want it. That knowledge fortifies and checks private elbality, and prevents it succumbing to the mere sight of squalor and rags. But throw any doubt upon this fact, and private charity immedi.itely falls back again on its o'wn indiscriminate ways. It is deprived of its confidence in the oDeration of the law, which alone justified to itself its refusal of casual aid. How far the late discovery in the Casual Ward of the West London Union may have had this bad effect we cannot say, but certainly its tendency was to destroy people's confidence in the worlking of the law, and deprive them of the certainty that real distress had always its remedy under our system. We are ready to welcome, tben, any proposal for a more effective relief of the vagrant class, both on account of the real charity which it would give and the false charity which it would prevent.

There was no Neuchftel Conference to-day, and I behove no day is fixed for the next meeting. It is much to be feared that the King of Prussia is a8ain suffering under an attack of his old malady of vacillation. M. de Hatzfeldt says he is waiting for instruc. tions or for an answer to his despatch communicatig the fact of the Plenipotentiaries having proposed the renunciation of the sovereignty in leuchatel as the base of negotiatio1s. M. de Hatzfeldt teemed as if that fact was then for the fast time inown to him, whereas from the long correspondence that had previously taken place he, as well as everybody else, had long been aware of it. An understanding was originally come to that aU differences should be previously arranged by means of diplomacy, so that when the Plenipotentiaries met it should beoa a matter of form, and merely to sign conventions or protocols. Since then new difficulties have arisen which rendered so speedy a solution impossible; and, though an arrangement without an appeal to arms is still very probable, yet I fear much more time will be consumed In effecting it than was supposed.
With respect to the terms of our treaty with Persia it was said, erroneously as I am given to understand, that Persia recognized purely and simply the independence of Herat. What Persia agreed to do was to restore HYerat to the reigning Prince on condition of his executing in future the conditions on which his ancestors obtained the sovereignty of it. The city of Herat and its territory were given to the family of Suddokzyes in 1741 by Nadir Shah in recompense for the great services rendered by the chief of that family to him during his campaign in India. Among the conditions imiposed at that period on the Suddokzyes, andwhich are binding on their successors, is that of recognizing the Shah of Persia as spiritual protector of the Muesulmans of the sect of All, and the late wr is attributed to the persecution by the Prince of Herat of those sectarians. But the Shah of Persia will have no right or power in the government or the administration of Herat; he will merely pro. serve his character of religious protector of the D)issenting Musaulmam of Herat, and whatever infuence he may retain is exclusively in that capacity.
It appears that the Sultan, who had already made a present to the Emperor Napoleon of the Church of the Nativity at Jerusalem, has, in order to render the gift complete, also given him the old palace of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, which is annexed to St. Peter's Prison. The Greeks had long solicited the same building. These ruins hare been surrendered to France on the ground of her considering herself as the representative of Catholic interests in the East.

(I:OM OUR OWNr ConmxSro"rnxr.)
MADBID, M&ano 6.
The slight attention paid by the public to so important a subject as that of the Estimates may, perhaps, be partly attributed to a prevalent feeling that the present order of things in Spain is of a transitory nature. It is as well, however, to be on one's guard against irmpressions of this kind, which have their origin in the impatient hopes of defeated political parties, and frequently prove unfounded. After Espartero's first deplorable overthrow, in1843, the Progresistas were just as sanguine as at present that the new regime could not possibly last. Nevertheless, it did last, with some changes of men, but with little variation in policy, for 11 years. It is true that the present Government is not strong, and that various parties are conspiring; but how many conspiracies were there not betWeen 1843 and 1854, and how fruitless they all proved until the insupportable tyranny of the Sartorius Cabinet and a military insurrection paved the way for a popular rising ! The Narvaez Government may be shortlived, but at p.esent there seems little pror.pect of its being replaced by one that would adopt a totally different system. For the moment, and notwithstanding the aggravating circumstance of dear bread, the country is quiet. The return to constitutional forms by the convocation of the Corte3 (howeverlittle freedom there may be in the electionof the members)has calmedthe popular mind for a timne; and there are not wanting persons who predict that this calm will continue, and that the nation will sink into that apathy which it has already repeatedly evinced during long periods of misgovernment.
As regards the Budget, among those who take the trouble to examnine into it the general feeling seem to be that it is not the amount of the sum to be expended, but the manner of its expenditure, that should excite regret and even alarm. It is said, and vwith much truth, that the excess of expenditure
over income, even were it larger than it is, should not be deplored were the money applied in a manner to benefit the country and to yield satisfac
tory returns-to public works,to roads and railways,
instead of to the payment of an enormous pension list, of a host of unnecessary employ6s, and to the support of a far larger miitary force than Spain at all requires. Instead of this we find that while the suns allotted to useful purposes-to roads, ports, &a., are reduced, a great increase is provided for in the cost of the army, in the collection of the revenue, in the allowances to thQieoyal family, aud in the interest on the public debt-the last hrising chiefly from the Mir4s loan, the whole
capital-of which is swallowed up by the deficiency of the year. The revenue is swollen by a very large
upped increase in Customs'. duties and in the prolitis4 the Government monopolies-an increase

The preparations for an expedition against MZexico continue, but the nal decision of the Government on this subject has not transpired. It is thought probable that the operations ill be limited to a blockade, and to the bombardment of Vera Cruz, and will not extend to the landing of a mnilitary. force, w;hich would involve great expense, and which the difficulties of the country and the dangers of the climate would render a hazardous and possibly a disastrous measure.

I would confidently ask if there ever was a case in which all those who are rost competent to form an opinion on a disputed question of policy were more absolutely unanimous in their opinion on it?
It is clear to every impartial observer of history that it is a great Providential law tbat, where civilization and barbarism come in contact, barbarism must give way to the onward pressure of civilization. It is equally clear that this law holds good where civilization comes in contact with that sort of semi-barbarism or semi-civilization which prevaiLs in China. No vote of the House of Commons, factious or honest, can stop or even stay the execution of the decrees of this law.
The Anglo-Saxon race will and must subdue China, and the inevitable confliot between the two raoes is a matter whoUy beyond the sphere of Parliamentary control.

ROYAL LITERARY FUND.-Yesterday afternoon
R:oYAL LrTERABy FuND.-Yesterday afternoon the annual general meeting of the members of this fund was held at the house of the association, Great Russell-steet
Earl Stanhope took the chair, and there were lo present Sir B. B. Cabbell, M.P., the Bishop of Oxford, M1r. Monckton Milnes, M.P., Mr. T. Foster, MIr. Charles Dickens, Mr. Wentworth Dilke, Mr. Dickenson, &c. The usual formal business was disposed of, and the finaneial report read, which gave a good acunt of the progres of the society, and showed that its in. come exceeded its expenditure by a small balance, which was added to the funded stock o the association. On the motion that the report be received and adopted, Mr. C. W. Dilke, sen., moved a resolution which, under a number of heads, condemned the entire management of the fundfirst, because, acrding to its last report, it e nded 574 18 Is. 3d. in relieving 53 cases; while the Artists Ge. neral Benevolent Fund, In relieving 68 cases, only expended 85&.; and,secondly,because the Literary Fund exnded2001. per annum on the maintenance of a house and allowed 2001. er annum to its secretary, and beuse ite accounts of the
iterary Fmud were not in a satisfactory state, as evidenced by their stating that the house fund, amounting to 6,540, was stiAl in existence s a eparate amount of the society's credit, whereas the books of the society showed that that fund never had been in existence at all; and, lastly, beca
the Literary Fund on an average, not givin away more than 1,5001. per annum, yet ap eed to the public for new subscriptions and donations while possessed of funded pro. perty o the amount of 30,0001. and of landed estates yield. ing 01. per annum. Mr. Dike supported his motion in a long and rather irrelevant speech, which was frequently Interrupted by cries of " Time !I and ' Question PI andwhich at length drew from the noble chairman a request that the speaker would consider the time of the mneeting and come at once to the xuion at issue. Mr. E. Bell replied at some length for tne management of the fund, contending that neither the resolution nor speech of Mr. Dilke was founded on fact. Ile had prominently put forward the number of cases relieved by the fund, but overlooked the immense number investigated at its cost. The office of seeretarT had been crated In 1836, on the motion of Mr. Dilke himself, and his salary had been gradually raised to 2001. per annum, in consequence of the really valuable services rendered by that officer. The error with regard tothe house fund had originated in the fund crediting itself with the 2001. per annum grantd in 1805 by the Prince of Wales towards a permanent fund for maintaining a house, and not counting the annual rent wLich had since been paid from that income. In fact, the house fund had been involved in the general funded accounts, and the permanent fumd was then debtor to the house fund the 6,0001. meationed by Mr. Dilke. Mr. Bell then -went into the question of general expenditure, and showed, from the accounts, that the society hiad been greatly the gainer since their present secretary bad been permanently engged, the average annual increase of income during that timenbng no lees than 5751. Referrin to an,article which had appeared In theAthm mu, and which charged t' - fund with not affording adequate assistance to the widow and children of the late Mr. Hadyn, the speaker went on to say that in six years Mr. Hadyn had received no less than 2001 from the funds of the society; that one of the three children of his widow had been provided for through the kindness of the Earl of Shaftesbury, another through the kindness of a member of the committee of the Literaru Fund, and the third and last had been got into the St. Ann's Asylum entirely through the exertions of the fund committee, who spent 671. in the purchase of votes to secure its election. Mr. Charles Dickens replied to Mir. Bell in a brief speech of much force and humour, supporting the resolution of Mr. Dilke. Alog and at ties rather acrimonious discussion followed,inwhich Mfr. John Foster, theBishop of Oxford, Mr. Monckton Mlnes, and Mrti. Due,se, tokpr,bttIatrgn Leas

RESUSAT OF BISuops TO CoNSZa:RG E CEMnTzx s. -A correspondence with the Secretary of State for the Home Department, as to the refusal of the Bishop of St. David'ls to consecrate the new cemetery for t'he borough of Swansea. South Wales, has been aid before Parliament and printed. It hence appears that the Lord Bishop of St. David's declined to consecrata or to license the new burial. ground or cembterybecause no conveyance for* the clergyman who was toofficate in the consecrted portion of th
cemetery was provided by the Bural Committee Board of Swansea The B3urial Committee unanimously decided that the Burial Board had not the power under the Act of Par.
amnent to provide any conveyanoe for the cld en officials, and also expresed an opinion that, even they had such power, it ought not to be executed, The Bishop having refused to consecrate or Ecense the ecmetery (on the 24th of December last), and, the case beingveryurgent, an appeal was made to the Home-office by the vicar and churchwardens of Swansea, representing the perplexity, difflculty, and eoense that would arise if the old burialgrounds of the parish were closed (as ordered by the Home-office) before a Ftting place was provided for the reception of the corpses of the parishioners, and asking for a delay of the order to close them. Secretary Sir George Grey, in reply, refused to grant any extendon of the time for closing the existing burnalgrounds attached tothe parish church (as requested by the vcar), wthout some sesurance that the difference between the Bishop and the Burial Board wais likely to be settled by some early and definite ime. Sir George observed at the samue time, that "the object of the Act of Parliament would be defeated if the mere refusal of a bishop to consecrate a burial-ground til
some condition on which he felt it rght to insist was complied with were held to be sufficient to postpone the operation of an order in Council founded on considerations of public health." It was intimated to the Home-office by the Buxial Board of Swansea (on the 30th of December) that the vicar had had nine brick vaults made " on speculation" at a new church at the Cocict, lately opened- "and as long," adds the writer of the letter, " a he (the vicar) can persuade the Bishop not to consecrate or grant a license to bury in the new ground, thoe more money he will be enabled to exact from the friendsef persons reuiring the same.

"As an instance of the character of the place, we may mention that, a few days since, on the admision of a poor fellow stabbed in two places the wounds opened afresh, and he must inevitably have bled to death had it not been for the promptness of a fellow-seaman, the master and assistant of the lazarette being helplesaly drunk.
" Those gr vely sick are dependent for nursng and attenton on their fellow-patients, the master rarely being present unles at some operation or tho doctor's rounds.
"There is no restraint upon the inmates, who go in and out at pleasure, some not unfrequently passing whole nights away from the establishment- visitors are allowed at all timesn which increases the disorder and produoes much positive mischief.
"We can only characterize the present house as a filthy and sickening substitute for that which humanity and morality alike demand.
" The medical men are unanimous in their condemnation of the present system, and the only excuse we can make is that no better arrangements can be made under the circumztanees.
"It is proposed that there shall be beds for 20 patients, with apartments for a superintendent, and necessary offSices. As regards the maintenance of the hospital, wvhen erected, it may be mentioned that the sick from Danish P russian, Norwegian, and Swfedish vessels are attendedi ana lodged, though very inadequately, by the toll of 3 copecks
"If a toll were allowed by British shipowncrs, It would keep the projected establishment in an efficient state, and that at a cnarge which would scarcely be felt, at the same time providing that steamers be only charged for the same number of voyages per season as those made by sailing vessels (viz., three voyages), otherwise their frequent visits to this port would cause the hospital charge to press too unequally upon them.
" Such charges are not questioned at Alexandria, Quebec, and many other ports which are frequented by our shipping, and it is hoped the suggestion will be approved.
" It is confidently and proudly felt that an appeal to our country wil be gladly and promptly attended to, and that those who assisted our soldiers and men-of-warsmen so generously and efficiently will not neglect those merchant seamen who risk the dangers of the intricate Baltic and the rigours of its climate to carry on the commerce of England but owill evince the same tenderness for thefever-racLed and suffering seamen at Cronstadt that they manifested towards their heroic countrymen at Scutari and Smyrna.

Gzx-AU L HosprrAn.-Yesterday evening the 12th anniversary festival of this useful charity was celebrated at theLondonTavemnwithrmarkedsuccess. HisRoyalHih ness the Duke of Cambridge presided, suported by his Serene Highness Prince Edwardof Saxe-Weunar, his Excellency the Prussian Minister, his Excellency the Hanoverian Minister, his Excellency the Minister for Saxony, Baron Knesebeck, hL E. Bunsen, Frederlik Hutt, Dr. Sutro, Dr. Barth, the well known traveller, &c. About 160 gentlemen sat down to an excellent dinner, which was served in the customary style of the London Tavern. The usual formal toasts having been liven, the Prussian M1linister returning thanks for the foreign Sovereigns patrons of the Hospital and Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar for the army, his Eighness gave the toast of the evening. To do so properly, he said, he must lay aside his military capacity and appear as a Chanoellor of the Exchequer providing a budget for the ensuing year. In this, however, he had a comDaratively easy task, for they all knewr how necessary an establishment the German Hosital had ben, and they must feel that nowr it wa,s established its maintenance was stUil more necessary to meet the calls of both German and English wfho depended upon its relief. The v,hole institution was conducted wfith a praisewvorthy economy, though at the same time with adue regardto the comfort and convence of the oor individuas who sought its fostering care. The working expenses of the hospital during the past year were only 2,850L, exclusve of repaiTs, and the receipts from all sources during the same period were 3,6171., of which sum 1,9991. 19s. Uid. were collected at the anniversary dinner, and 9771. from annual subscriptions, being 801. more than the subseriptions for the previous year. From these various channels the debt of 1.5001. with which the year commenced had been reduced to 1,0001., and an addition of 1,0001. had been made to the funded
perty, which now amounted to 3, 355 N No less than 91°in patients had been in the hospital during the past year and among these vwere 124 cases of accidents, 108 of them being English. The out-patients for the same period were 11,006, of which number more than 4,000 were natives of this country. Since the opening of the hospital the in-patients amounted to 6,697, and the out-patients to 52,890, makIng a grand total of 59,587 who had sought the benefit of its relief. His Highness, in conclusion, warmly advocated the claims of the charitv in forcible and moving terms and the toast was moet enthusiastically responded to, as, indeed, were all which be gave in the course of the evening. A practical proof of the favour with which his Hlighness's speech vas received may be found in the fact that nearly 1,9001. was immediately subscribed to the charity. Other complimentary toasts followed, and %ere replied to with warmth and humour, and the proceedings terminated with much MeI . The mnsical arrangements were most excellent, and Herr Wilhelm Ganz and Herr Deichmann, who volunteered their services, performed some exquisite solos and duets on the piano and violin.
THE CHZS]B DoNs Y.-Abb6 Hue, in the excellent -work that chronicles his experiences in China, introduces a donkey that, in the present state of political affaits, affords an instructive moral Oddly as it may sound, the Coalition andE the donkoy, philosephically considered, bave a relation with each other. Well, the adventurous Abbe relates that, journeying with other missionary conpanions in the interior of wia there was-it will happen m the very best society-a monstrous donkey in the company. Notwithstanding the downward influence of philosophers before the time of Mr. Cobden's favourite Aristotle, China, it seems, is rather famous for its monstrous donkeys The travellers sought what shelter they could every nI ht, and every night addressed themselves to sleep. But seep was not permitted to descend upon them. The donkey would not allow the travelle the luxury of hall-an-hour's repose. All the live-long night did this monster bray and bray, revealing to his hearers-as will happen with certain speakers-what a remarkably great ass he was. The poor Abbe and his brother missionaries never closed their eyelids. StiUl the jackass awoke the echoes and still their very brains were jadecd by
* The long, Iry ee.aw of his bonible bamy"
Christian flesh and blood of the very meekest could not endure the torment, and at lenth the Abbe commanded one of the Chinese, who travelli with the pilgrims to enforce thu donkey to silence. Anywai, and at any cost, that jackass must be dumfounded. The Chinaman, in his manuer, promised after his fashion, to bind the donkey over to keep the peace ; and-deliciouawas thesple, abounding the comfort-the Abb6 and his companionsslept soundly as babes. In the mornig, the Abb with a glow of gratitude in his bradt, dernandecd of the Chinaman the M'eanLs by which he had silenced the ass-by what power was the donkey dumnfoundedl "Come here," aild John Chinaman, and he lad the wayto an adoining shed, where stood the am.

",N mu was neca Dy a person who since 1854 had been in possession (a mortgagee) of certain leasehold houses at IKentish-town, but was turned out by the sberiff in consequence of a verdict bAving been obtained by the original landlord for broaches of covenant in the lease. The defendant Fish was the original lessee, but had assigned his interest subject to the maortaes. The suit was oriiinally for a foreclomur, but the plantif as he alleged, having suffered damage by reason of the non-fulfilment ox the covenants to drain, make a roadway, &l., had by agreement with the defendant. changed the object of ihe bill so far as to make it sek relef by such decree as the Court thought just in respect of such damage.
frw. Glasse and M1r. Cottrell appeared for the plaintiffs;M a. Bily, Mr. Greene, Mr. Leonard, and Mr. Griffiths (of the common law bar) appeared for the defendants.
Mr. GLASS= was heard in reply
The VIC HmC,CLLOn thought that this was a very unfortunatelitigation. Theplaintiffs' contentlonwas that at law the assignee of the lease would be liable to him (Nokes) for damages, and, that being so, this Court would make the cestuigawe trust pay those damages, which might be re covered against the assignee; but that appeared to his Honour not to be so, and no anthority had been found to Support such a proposition. The person against whom the Elaintiff, if hebad angremedy, must go was the sub-lessee - to
oldotherwssewoul beraisig a new equity and precedent the establishment of which would be productive of great in convenience to the public. The allegations contained in the bil, givng the plaintiff erery benefit to be derived from the agreement to change its object, were not such as supported the case made at the bar; but, auming that they did, the plantif,forth resos bfoe satd, oud have no relief. enbili'must be dismissed, with cosctsfrom the time of the eviction.

PURCELL V rAX-NG.
This was a bill for the purpose of obtsining a direction bLthe Court for the defendant to recoup and pay to the
wintiffl2991. which the latter alleged ad been receivedl by the defendant in excess of his share of the residuary personal estate of the late Edward Stephen Mannig, the testa. tor in the cause of " Manning v. Purcell." The usual aecounts in an administrtion suit had been directed in that cause, and in the proceedings before the Chief Clerk certain
ccomunts had been admitted by the consent of the present plaintiff and defendant to be correct, and upon the basis of that admission a division of the residuary personal estate of the testator, Edward S. Manning, had taken place between the plaintiffand defendant in what the plaintiff alleged was supposed to be equal moieties. The plaintiff's case was I that he had recently and subsequently to such divi-
sion discovered that the admission so made was founded in a mistake, the recult of which was that the defendant had received 1,2991. more than he was entitled to receive, and the plaintiff now sought to have that mistake rectified. The defendant contended that the bill in the present suit was in the nature of a bill of review, and, as the leave of the Court to file it had not been obtained, the case could not be heard i that the plaintiff was bound and concluded by the admiasion which he ,had made by consent in the former suit of "Mabnning v. Purcell," and that the defendant could discover no such mistake as that alleged by the plaintit The case was not concluded wEen the Court rose.
Mr. MaIains and Mr. Martndale appeared for the plaiintiff, and Mr. Bacon and Mr. Renshaw for the defendant.
(Before Vicc-Chancellor Sir W. P. WOOD.)
SmImm V. HAREISo?.
The object of this suit was to set aside a sale of the interest (if any) of Francis Norton in certain leasehold premises, which were put up for sale under the order of the sheriff, and of which the plaintiff was declared the purchaser for the sum of 15L. Theproperty was decribed in the particulars of sale as "the chattel interest (if any) of Frarcis Norton in the lease of the premises, No. 1, Yorkstreet, St. James's." It was stated in the particulars that the sheriff was informed that there was a lien on lease for 1001. The plaintiff by his bill alleged that he bid for the property put up for sale, believing that it was a bond Jidc transaction, but after the sle discovered the following circumstances:-That the firm of Frost and Norton, to whioh Francis Norton formerly belonged, had become insolTent, and F. Norton was of unsound mind - that his son who was one of the partners, had been adjudged bankrupt
and that Frederick Bargoyne Harrison, the defendant to the present suit, who was a creditor of the firm, had been appointed his trade assignee, and had since the bankruptcy been carrying on the buiness- that Harrison had bro ht an acton against F. Norton, the elder, and obtained g *ment against him for 2,0051. 14s. ; that a writ of fieri fcciacs had been issued, under which the sheriff had received instructions to sell the chattel Interest of P. Norton, the defendant to the action at law, though Harrison, as the bill alleged, knew that no beneficial interest could pass. The bill further alleged that a clerk of Harrison's attended the sale, and ran up the biddings to loOZ. The bill prayed that the pretended sale might be declared fraudulent and void as against the plaintiff. and that the money and interest might bo refunded. The defendant, by his answer, denied the charge of fraud, and it was contended on his behalf that the plaintif had full opportunity of ascertaining the value of the property, and that there was no irreriarity either in the action at law, in the judgment, or in te le, which proceedings were necessa to establsh Harrison's right to the separato property of F. Norton the elder.
Mr. Rolt Q.C., and Mr.G. 1L Giffard appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Cairns, Q.C., and Mr. S. B. Toller for the defendant.
Ihe VIo-CHGocErxon said that he did not consider there was any fraudulent intention on the part of Harrison, but it would be a fraud to retain the money paid by the plaintiff. After stating the facts of the case his Honour said that he considered the action at law and the judgment to have been quite regular. The defendant had admitted in his answer that the interest of Francis Norton which was put up for sale was of no intrinsic value, and there was no doubt of the defendant's agency in the sale as he bad instructed his soUcitor who prepared the pariculars and conditions of sale for the sheriff. The purchaser might have been informed by the particulars of sale that the property was subject to the debts of the partnership, and a purchase under such circumstances wa quito a speculation - buta pur chaser could not suppose that property to be sold under a sheriff's order was a mere nonentity; nor was he bound to look intotha partnership accounts. He did not say that there was any misrepresentation onthepart ofthedefendant, but there was a concealnient by him of that which he knew and of which a purchaser oould not bo informed. If the ircumfistances under which the Sale was effected had been stated, the defendant's object would have been accomplished, and there would, of course, have been no biddings. Then it was unfortunate thatthe defendant, who knew the Property to be worth nothing, had employed his clerk to bid up to a high price. Under these circumstances it was impossible on the prnciples of this Court to say that the sale could stand. He did not impute any intentiGnal fraud to the defendant; but there would be fraud in keep[ iDg the purchase.money for that wvhich was of no value. [The only fault that could be imputed to the purchaser was
I an intemperate letter written by him after the sale,
charging the defendant with fraudulent conduct. The decree would be that the sale would be declared void as against the purcnaser, that the purchase-money be refunded, and that the defendant pay the costs of the suit.

AYLiESBURY, MARCII 11.
URROWN COuRT.-
(Before the CHIEF BRoN.)
t'hilp White, aged 45, the bill against whom for murder. ilg Mary White, his wife, was yesterday thrown out by tho trand jury, was arraigned this morning on another charge - of an almost equally atrocious character- that, namely, of
edmanistering a noxious drug called hicr&a pickra to Ann Seaward, on the 3d and 7th of December last, with intent to procure a miscarriage. As this charge arose out of the inquiry into the cause of Mary White's death, and bat for that 'would, in all human probability, never have been brought to light, it may be desirable that the whole history of the prisoner shoald be disclosed. It appears that Philip White, who was a shoeraaker by trade, lived in Chesham, where, having married in early life, he brought up a large family. Unfortunately his wife died,and, at the invitation of his eldest daughter, Ann Seaward, a girl of 20, was induced to take up her residence in his house, in order that she might discharge the household duties in the intervals of her attendance at the silk mill in the town. - This took place about 16 months back, and in a very short
time after the prisoner seduced his housekeeper. Indeed, report said that he had made improper attempts on the bonour of his own child. Be that as it may, he succeeded but too well with the prosecutrix, and continued his connexion until he took a second wife at Whitsuntide, 1856, the woman selected for that honour being the mother of three ilegitimate children by other men, the youngest being a mere infant and out at nurse, all w.hich facts were well known to the prisoner, who undertook to support this burden. He seems, however, as might well be expected, to have grown tired of this charge and Of his poor wie also, for he was often heard to wish himself unmarnied, and as he was a year ago. About October or &overtber lst his wife went out to nurse at Chesham Bois Comx*n, in order to gain the means of supporting her child ; and during her absence the prisoner induced Ann Seaward, with whom he had not ceased to carry on his illicit intercouse, and even with the knowledge of hiswife,tocome againaudtakecareof things. Duringthis visit the wifeusedto come home on Sundays and once in the week, and on the 3d of December, being at home, she bought a quantity of arsenic mixed with soot, alleging that she wanted it to poison mice. What became of that poison is not known, except by inference ; no trace of the packet or of its contents was ever disdovered; and it was clear that OMr. White that day returned to the common, where she remained till the 14th of Decembei, when her husband came and fetched her home, saying he could not get on without her, Ann Seaward's attendance being uncertain, and her presence not always pleasurable. The prisoner evinced feelings of jealousy, and about this time he asked Ann Seaward to marr him, saying that his wifo had told himi she should shortly die. When his wife came home she was suffering from erysipelas in her face, and after a few days growing 'worse she took to her bed, and ultimately expired on the 28th of December, The absence of any doctor till the last moment, when the poor woman's mother cailed in one, and some suspicious symptoms which gradually became known led to a coroner's inquest. Previous to this the prisoner bad stated confidentially to his sister and a woman named Mitchell that his wife had been accustomed to take arsenic, in order to procure a miscarriage, and when the coroner ordered a post mortem examination the prisoner frantically rushed out of the room and threatened to blow out his brains, saying he knew they would find arsenic, as his wife used to take it for the cause above stated, and that they would bring it in manslaughter. During the inquest Ann Seaward was an important witness, and in the course of her evidence detailing her intimaoy with the prisoner and attendance on his wife during her last illness, she stated that, having informed the prisoner of her apprehension that she was in the familyway by him, he said he could give her something - to " set her right," and on the following day, December 3,
he gave her 3d. with directions to buy .,ot. of what he termed "hicra picra." The girl obeyed his directions, and having procured the drug (which was stated to be in common use among women as a cordial aperient, a dose being about 10 grains) placed it in the bands of the prisoner, who mixed a portion of it in gin and something else, and gave it to her to drink, saying that it would make her poorly and sick, but would set her right. The coroner's jury having returned a verdict of "Wilful murder" against the prisoner, the
resent charge was also gone into, and he was committed s take his trial on both ; but, as has been already stated, therand jury ignored the bill for the capital offence.
DASENT now in opening the present case, entreated the 3ury to discard irom their minds all that they might have heard prejudicial to the prisoner in reference to his wife, and to confine their attention exclusively to the evidence wvhich he would adduce in reference to the charge . now immediately before them. The learned counsel then
Ann Seaward, who repeated her former statement, and added that, by the directions of the prisoner, she hRd taken tWo doses of the same mixture on the 3d and 7th of December, and that on both occasions she was sick at the stomach and rendered incapable of work during the day; but experienced no further inconvenience. She also stated that, though she believed herself to have been in the familyway when she took the drug, she wee now satisfied that she never had been in that situation.
A medical man proved that the excessive quantity administered to the gIrl was her safety, as she had evidently trown it all up On each occasion, and, in order to show that the prisoner knew-the natureof thedrug, the keeper of the Chesham lock-up stated that after the inquest the prisoner, among other statements relative to his wife's case, said-" I suppose Ann Seaward is the cause of my being here ;" and afterwards added, " If I had a fast breeder i would give her some hicra picra if it -would not -hurt her."
Mr. 1L iLLas having addressed the jury for the prisoner, His LoRDsiw p left it to them, after having gone over the evidence in detail, to say whether they attached credit to the evidence of the prosecutrix, confirmed as it was in a strong point by that of the keeper of the lock-up.
The iury having without any hesitation returned a verdict 'Of Guitty,,
The CO: BABON proceeded to pass sentence. In so doing he enlarged upon the conduct of the prisoner, stating that, in his opinion, this Was the most aggravated case under the act which he had ever met with. Without importing into it the recollection of the other and more serious charge *now henging over his head, but the bill for which had been thrown out, he thought the Present case was one so serious as to call for the infliction of the utmost sentence sanctIoned by the law, and, in accordance with that opinion, the sentence of the Court was that the prisoner should be transported for the term of his natural life.
The prisoner was then arraigned on, and pleaded "TNot Gnilty to, the ooroner's inquisition.
Mx. DASMT, with whomn was Mr. Keane, stated that, as the grand jury had in their discretion thought proper to throw out the bi which had been presented to them in suPpoxt of the capital charge against the prisoner, he did not think it right, as representmg the Attorney-General, that any evidence should be offered in support of the inquistion. In his opinion such a course would be both unusual and disrespc tfu to the grand jury, and therefore, subject to the sanction of the learned Chief Baron, he -would withdraw from the present charge.
The CEFBARON, havng expressed his concurrence in the course proposed by the learned counsel on behalf of the Crown, as one which was both usual and correct, directed the iury to acquit the prisoner.
The jury thereupon returned a verdict of Not Guilty on the coroner's inquisition, and the prisoner was at once removed from the dock.
George Dixon, aged 22, and George Hcarn, aged 21, were indice for night poaching at EUesborougb, and also for feloniously assaulting the keepers of Lady Frankland Rusell on the 8th of Dctember last.
Mr. STEPHEINSON was counsel for the prosecution, and: Called the two keepers, who stated that on the nigut in question, boing out watching with a large mnuzzled mastiff, -near a wood in which was great store of " long tails," they distinctly heard the report of three guns discharged inrapid succession. On entering the wood they saw some men running down a glade, and, unlooing their friend the dog, they set off in pursuit. The dog soon overtook the poachers who were four in number, and knocked over three of them, one after the other, by jumping upon them, but without injuring them, being still muzzled. By the time the keepers came up the poachers had recovered their legs and then a " battle royal" ensued, which resulted in divers iroken heads and guns. The odds being so decidedly in favour of the poachers, the keepers, after sustaining an unequal contest for some minutes, at last cried, "Hold, enough !" and the poachers, taking them at their .wod, ceased from futther molestation, and all marched out* of the wood, while the keepers and their quadrupedal ally I w wended homewards with their respective tails betweea their: legs. The question, under those circumstances, was whethler the pnsoners weore elearly identified as having partici.pated in this affair. On this theme
MIr. MLL;s addressed the jury, w ho, after a brief deliborahion returned a verdict of ZNot Guily.

PRAiT V. WRIGHT Ahn1) OTHBS.
This was an action of ejectment to recover possession of a mnall piece of land at Worth Woolwich.
1Mr. lush was for the plaintiff; and Mx. E. James, Q.C., and Mr. Hawkins were counsel-for the defendants.
It appeared that the land in question waz a portion of an estate that had been purcha8ed by the Kent Freehold Land 15ociety, end which had been divided into a number of ilotmente, one of which had been purchased by the plaintiff in 1852 from a person named Brown, who had Dased it Oe!gn&Uy from the society, and another by the
defendant Wright in the following.year. Both uartie eiaimedto Wake purchased tho same piece of land; antthe t>2aintiff m*ad*4it bJ his conveyance that the land clearly
don ed to hltr and was tht portion of the estate thati he lid~purchased from thie land society.
'Jfr* JRx~s intlmated that he could not dispute the title jo the Land t'cat had been established by the pLaintiff, but he said the defendant had paid his honey for a pieoe of land and ether by mistake or wilfuly the same piece had been cornveyed to him, and it was a very areat hardship upeon *him,p2rticulauly as 'he bad built three houses upon thle land in qnestion.'.---
Mr. 1;USII aaid.- it was entirely the defendant's owunfa'i1
that he was placed in his present situation. The moment he commenced- his building operations notice *was given to bim that the land belonged to-the ptaintiff, and his legal ad. viser was allowed to seethe plaintiff's conveyance, ut notwithstanding this he obstinately persisted in going on 'with the houses, and the plaintiff had no -alternative but to bringthe present action.
* Mr. JAms said that his client was willing to purcbase the land or to sell the houses in the condition they were atthe present moment to. the plaintiff.
Mr. Lvsn having stated the price that would be required. for thon land,
Mr. JKAs said he was instructed that this was a great deal more than its value, and the defendant could not consent to the arrangement.
Mr. Justice CBswESLL observed that the defendant had got himself into his present position by his own obstinacy, and he had better make the best terms that he could with the plaintiff, but he said that the latter ought not to press u-pon him too hardly.
Some further consultation then took place between the leazned counsel on both sides, and at length it was announced thattt the parties had agreed upon terms to settle the
A verdict wias consequently takea for the plaintiff.
Mr. JAi^5E observed that there was very lhttle doubt that these unfortunate mistakes arose through the estremely m0icnutte subdivision of property that was made by the land
hMr. Justice CRXSSwLL remarked that they would no doubt be productive of a very good crop by and by. (A laugh.)
Mr. Lrusm said he knew of one instance where the auctioneer of the society disposed of a number of lots without any plan whatever, and merely by stating the number of feet of land that were sold to each purchaser.
WICKRAn V. THE GUARDI4'S OF THE ROO UNON.
This was an action to recover 601. for six years' use of a room for the safe custodyof the registerof births, marriages, and deaths for the above union.
Serjeant Shee and Mr. Prentis were for the plaintiff; and Mr. M. Chambers, Q.C., and MIr. Ogle appeared for the defendants.
The plaintiff, it appeared, was a solicitor at Strood, and also formerly held the office of lerk to the board of guardians of the Eootrnion, and was likewise superlntendinrgistrar of births, deaths, and marriages. In the year 1850 hc reoigned the office of clerk to the board, but continued to hold the other appointment, and the present action was brought to recover the sum of 601. for the use of a room in his office as a place of deposit for the registers and books containing the entries of thebirths, deaths, and marriages of theunion for six years. In 1851 the plaintiff made a claim upon the guar. dians for a SmUI of 51. for the use of his office in the way referred to for one year, but the board of guardians refused to pay the amount, and a correspondence took place with the board in London, and it appeared that the Registrar. General expressed an opinion that the plaintiff was entitled to be paid, but it seemed that the board of guardias still refused to settle the claim, and the plaintiff was at length compelled to bring the present ction to enforce it. In order to support the case of the plain. tiff a great mass of correspondence that bad passed between him and the board of guardians and the head office in London was put in, the effect of which was to show that a portion of the office he occupied was sanctioned as a receptacle for the registers of the union, and that the secretary to the general board in London had authorized the y- ment of the claim of the plaintiff, and had also expressedan opinion that 101. per annum was a very fair sum to be paid for such a place of deposit, and that from 101. to 301. a-year was the usual mum paid throughout the country for this purpse.
The action was brought upon the 9th section of theRegistration Act, 'which directs boards of guardians to take the necessary proceedings for the preservation and preparation of the registers, and empowers them to pay the necessary expenses out of the funds of the union.
Mr. CHLAErsdi, on the part of the defendants, said that the board of guardians, as the trustees of the ratepayers, felt it their duty to defend the present action, and their defence was founded justly upon the fact that the charge that was made was exorbitant, and that, at all events, the plaintiff was not entitled to more than the snum of 51. per annum, which he had originally demanded; and, secondly, that the existing board of guardians were not liable under the 9th section to be proceeded aga:inst under the present form of action.
Mr. Justice CBESswzrL said he should reserve the ques. tion of law, and he then addressed the jury, and sad he should have thought that after the superintending-zegistrar in loundon had given an o,nion that the plantiff was en. titled to l l. a-year for taing charge of the registers the board of guardians need not have objected to paying that amount. The only question for the jury, however, was whether he was entitled to that or a less sum, and the ques. tion of law as to whether the board of guardians was hlable under this form of return would be reserved for after consideration.
The jury retuwned a verdict for the plaintiff for 301
that being at the rate of 51. a-year, and a verdict was accordingly entered for that amount subject to the question Of laIw.
CROWN SIDE.-(Before Afr. Baron CHAr1NEL.)
John M'Carthy, 17, waschargedwith feloniously throwing a tone at a railway train, and thereby endangering the safety of the passengers.
Mr. Woolett rosecuted.
It appeared that the prisoner and another boy were at work in a field adjoining the Northflect cutting upon the North Kenit Raiway on the 6th inst., land just as a train was passing along the prisoner threw a large stone at it, and, upon the arrival-ot the train at Greenhithe, the guard discovered that one of the windows of a first-class carrig
had been broken, and a flint stone was found inide the carriage.
The defence set up by the prisoner was that he did not intend to throw the stone at the train, but that it was thrown at the other boy.
The jury found the prisoner Guilty.
Mr. WOOLLLTT stated that the practice of throwing stones at the trains while passinn through the Northfleet cutting was so frequent that the dlrectors were compelled to institute the present prosecution for the protection of the pubhic against such proceedings in future.
The prisoner was sentenced to three month5' imprison. msent, with hard labour.

aIr. Wheelhouse prosecuted, and Mr. Maule defended the prisoner.
The prosecutor, Thomas Atkinson, had been to leeds. and was returning to his own house, a plaee called Mill Shaw, about three miles off, on foot. When about 500 yards from his own house, in a very lonely part of the road, the prisoner and amother man came up to him from the roadside, and, after walking about 40 Tards by the aide of him, the prisoner seized him from behind by the throat, pressed him down backwArds until he nearly broke his spine over a roughcast stone wall, and so kept him till the other man had thoroughly riaed his pockets. The prisoner told his comrade to take his watch, but it so happened that the prosecutor had not taken it with him on the occasion. This, and the fact of the prosecutor having, as he said, known the prisoner all his life, at once made the prosecutor recognize him as one of his assailants. Next morning he was apprehended, and then sald he had not seen the pro. aecutor for two months.
Mr. Mlurz contended that the identityswas not suffi. ciently rnade out, nd called a witness to show that the pri. soner was not present at the robbery.p

1URMNAL COUIRT.--(BeforC Mr. Justice CROWDEX.)
Thomas Williams, ged 29, lathe-fitter, W. Eden, aced 28, labourer, George Mason, aged 42, were charged with uttering a forged 51. Bank of England note, knowing it to be forged.
Mr. Whateley, Q.C., and Mr. V. Richards appeared for the prosecution- Mr. K Kettle defended Williams, and Mr. Powell defendea the other two prisoners.
It appeared that on the 9th of January last the prisoner Mason was in Kidderminster, and at between 5and 6 o'clock
p.m. he went into the shop of a batcher named Webster and bought a shoulder of mutton for 4s. 6d. He tendered what purported to be a 51. Bank of England note in payment. Webster said he thought the note was a bad one, and told Mason so. The note, which had the name
"Badger" on it, was returned to Mason, and he went away, saying that he would return for the mutton.
W .zitt, another butcher at Kidderminster, stated that near 6 o'clock on the same evening, the prisoner Eden came into his shop, and said he wanted a leg of mutton, if he could change a 5L-note. The witness said he could change it, if it was one of Turner's. The prisoner said it was a U1. Bank of England note, and produced a note like the one now in question, which the witness told the prisoner was a bad one. The prisoner then took up the note, and walked away.
J. Toon, a third butcher, said, Eden came into his shop at half-past 6 o'clock the same evening, and asked for a leg of mutton, but as he had none, he bought a loin, and tendered a 51.-note, which the butcher said he could not change. The prisoner went away to get change, but never returned. At half -ast 9 o'clock the same evening the three prisoners were all found at the railway station, and taken into custody on a charge of uttering base coin. The prisoner Williams threw away some. thing on to the rail. They were all searched. OnWIlliams was found a good 5. Bank of EnRland note and 8da in cop. per; on Mason a halfcrown; and on Eden a balfcrown and a halfsovereign in a purse. 'The officer then returned and starched on the rail where Wiliams had thrown something, and found two notes which purported to be of the a of England. One of these notes had the word " Badger" on the back, and was identified as the one tendered by Mason to the butcher Webster. Both were bad. While the prisoners were at the station, Eden was seen to take something from his purse and pass it to Wiliams before the party was taken Into custody.
Several witnesses were examined to show that the prisoners had all been together in the afternoon, and that they went down to the railway station in company

Mr. Spooner appe-ared for the preoeution, 3Mr. Huddleston defended the prisoner.
In this case the prisoner had been admitted to bal by order of the Court of Queen's Bench, and now surrendered to take his trial on the charge of having caused the death of his wife in a stragle which took place between the parties at the Stoke En.t Works on the 8th of September last. It appeared that on the day in question the prisoner was at work, and between 12 and 1 o'clock the deoeased came to the works and brought the prisoner his dinner. She went away, and in 5 or 10 minutes returned, in what the witness called a most " r ting state," and in an "awful predicament," bywbichihe witness meant she was ins areat passion, but what was the cause of her anger did not learly appear. The prisoner was very gentle with her, and endeavoured to sootheher, and advised her to go home. She would not do so, andcontinued her abuse for some time-till the prisoner went out of the shor where he was into a room where there were some iron saltpans. They were there seen styruggling together. The prisoner was standing ver his Wife, and they were both pulling each other's E. e was then seen to lift his wife up, and in a xhort time after she died, as thedoctor said, of ooncussion of the brain. The prisoner was seen with a door key in his hand and on the woman's right temple there was a wound which might have been produced by the end of the key; but there was no corresponding Nury onthe brain.

ZASION.HOu.-A1en Bemnish the boy who a few days ago was charged with having obtained money from a fish saesman in Bngsgate-market upon a forged order, was brought before Alderman fALz upon other charges of a more senous nAture
lr. Frederick J. Padley, mining broker, of No. 4, Unioncourt, Old Broad-street, said,-The prisoner was employed by me as clerk and errand boy, Se was in the habitof going to my bankers for me with checks for payment. OnI the 4th of February I gave him a check for 5l., upon the
ondok and Westminster Bank. Be was to bring me beck the amount, and on his return he brought me 51., I think in gold. The check produced is that which I gave bim, but since that time the word "ten," and the figure " 1 " have been added to the check, thus maldug it appear to be a check for EL IOs instead of 5l. On the 23d of FebruarylI sent him to the bank for my passbook with a written order, and on examining the book I found in it entries of payments for 31
41., 41., and 3. but there were no checks m the book to correspond with tiose entries, and no such cbecks were drawn by me. The prisoner brought the passbook back, and it contained the check for 5. which had been altered. I asked him if he knew anything about the checks, and he said " No," and I sent for bis father and a policeman I then locked the door of the room in which the prisoner was and went to the bank to make inquiries. Some time after I found that the room I had locked was open, and that the boy was gone, and on the pad on his desk I found the words, in his writing, " I am gone, and yoau'll hear of me no more." When I asked the prisoner if the word "ten" in the check was my writing he said, " No, but it was something like his own." Upon examining bis pad I found my name written in imitation of my writing in three places, and also the word "1ten." A few days after he left me I received fromx Mr. Frentzel 41 19& 6d. The check produced, dated the 23d of February, for 41., and purporting to be signed by me, is not in my handwriting, nor was it written bymy authority. I have no doubt it is the prisoner's. On examining my checkbook I findit apparent that several checks have been abstracted. I keep it locked up in a drawer, the lock of which has been tampered with.
Mr. T. Waran, cashier at the London and Westminster Bank-, nsid,-Mr. FP J. Padley keeps an account at our bank. On the 23dof February I paid the check produced for 41. to a boy, but I cannot say whether it was to the prisoner Ipa it. Foon after I paid the check Ireceived some directions about Mr. Padley's checks, and I was directed to send the check I had just paid to Mr. Padley.
Mr. Rudolph Frentzel, clerk to Mr. Holdforth, 5, Unioncourt, Old Broad-street, mercbant, said,-Oar office is next door to Mr. Pdley's. A wall separates the yards. On the 23d of February, between half-past 4 and 6 o'clockl I saw the prisoner get over the wall from No. 4. Before he got over I heard some money thrown over into the yard, and I went and picked it up, and then some more money fell onto a skylight, and I picked that up also. The whole gum I picked up was 41. l9s. 6d. The prsoner said that Mr. Padley had dropped the money out of his pocket, and I inferred that the boy had got over the wall to get the money; and I told him if Mr. Padley badlost ithe would, no doubt, come himself for it- and the boy went out of our house to fetch, as I supposed Mr. Padley. I kept the money for a few days, and from what I heard I afterwards went and gave it to Mr. Padley.
Mr. A. laines, clerk in the London and Westminster Bank,* sid,-It is my duty to make up the passbooks from the checks, and when the amounts are entered I put the checks into the pockets of the books, to be returned to the customers. The entries, on the 12th of February 31, on the 14th 51. 10s, on the 16th 41., on the 19th 41P, and on the 21st 31., were made by me from checks corresponding with those amounts, and I p laced the checks, as usual, in tho pocket of Mr. Padley's passbook. I delivered, by Mr. Padley's written order, the psbook to the risoner I beheve the checks were in the book when I delvered it.
Mr. J. Rugg, cashier to the London and Westminster Bank, dd,-The checkproduced for 51. lOs was presented to me in e usual manner over the counter, and I paid to the person who brought it that sum.
Joseph Brown (584) aid,-On the 5th of March I took the prisoner into custody upon another charge. On our way to the station-house I told him that he had assed a check of Mr. Padley's for 41. He said that Mr. Padley had no occasion to holob about it, s that gentleman had got 4. ls. 6d., instead of 41. ; that he (the prisoner) had tbrown the money out of the window into a dustbin in the adjoining yard, and afterwards made his escape from the window, and that the money had been picked up by a entleman in theaocing house, and returned to Mr. Fadley ILaskedhim how he could think of forging his master's name, and he said "Oh anybody can do tbat, s he joined it altogether, and I canyit a great deal better than he can." aughter.) c Telasgredeatter

The prlsoner's father here walked into the witness hbo
and saidit had been Insinuated that he had encouraged his child to commit these offences, and he begged that the alderman would hear what he had to say.
Alderman HyL-Not one word has been uttered to your prejudice in this room.
The prisoner was then committed for trial upon two charges of forgery, and Mr. Foxall, the fish salesman, who bad brought the charge against the prisoner some days ago of having obtained money from him upon a forged order in the name of ColonelfHughes, was told that the offence committed by the prisoner in that case came under the head of " misdemeanonr," and that the prisoner might be indicted for it at the Central Criminal Court.
The LoRD MAYop requested that the Press wouldac. knowledge his receipt of a sovereign from 'A LAdy," lOs. of which were to be given to George Harmsworth, the fire man who saved some lives at the fire at the Essex Taverni in Aldgate, and the remaining 10s. to be put in tho poor-box.

From the evidence already given in this case it appeared that the prisoner had been about a month in the employ of Mr, Castor, of Old Jewry-chambers, when he was detained at the money order-ofce upon presenting the order for 31. 10s. It was then found that tho prisoner had arrived early st his master's office, and, having obtained the letters from the porter, be opened them, and having abstracted the mponey orders he resealed some of the letters and destroyed others. When taken into custody a letter addressed to his master was found upon hin, containing an order for 21. 9s. and the halves of two 101.-notes.
Mr. Henry Perkiss aid,-I live at Southampton. On the 3d of March I wrote to Mfr. Castor, enclosing him the post. office order for 21. 9Os, which is now produced. The receipt was not signed at that time. I also enclosed the halves of two 10-notes. I posted the letter myself.

WoRsnrp.smr.-Mr. John Jay, a builder and conractor in extensive busine5sin Finsbury, appeared on an adjourned summons before Mr. D'EYNCOImT, to show cause why he had unlawfuly neglected to serve the surveyor of the district with certain prescribed statutory notices in reference to alarge building he had contracted to erect hi Artillery-place North, Finsbury-square, for the accommnodation of the Royal London MIitia, nd by which, under the Metropolitan Building Act (18th and 19th VIctoria,
ap, 122, he hadincurred a penaltyof 201.
The case has exdted a great deal of interest, though so apparently devoid of any, and has occupied the magistrate's unflagging attention fora good length of time. but the substance of it may be stated in this way:-Mr. Hammon, the district surveyor for St Luke's parish, on finding that the defendant h d pulled down numerous large houses In the Cityroad forthep of erecting an extensive building adjoining the Ar ery-ground, for the object before'
specified, without serving him with the usual formal notioes | vrenderedcompulsorybytheBuildingAct, calledat Mr. ay'sl house for an explanation. The defendant in the course of it aid he was erecting the buildings for the Commnissoners of Lieutenancy of the city, and that he had direct0ons to. proceedwith the work without reference to the district surveyor. On this Mr. Hamimon communicated with the solicitor of the IAeutenancy Commissioners, but without any result, and as the defendant was manifestl, as he thought, going in direct opposition to the Act of Parliament, he adopted the present proceedings to determine the question.
Mr. Smith, treasurer and solicitor to the Lientenancy, contendedit was notat all necessary to servenoticesupon the ditzict surveyor, whoever he might happen to be, as the bulding wasfor the use andaservice of Her Majesty, and therefore exempt from the usnul restrictions, it bemng in tended a a depot for the arms, accoutrements, and other clothing of the city militia, as well as the personal acoormnodation of the officers and men on the Dermanent staff of the regiment. The Commissioners of Lientenancy derived their authority by commission from the Crown under the get seal, and were wholly distinct as a body from the cor-
Eration o London. The whole expenses would he den-
yad out of a rate for such purpose established in the ign of Charles IL, calledthe Trophy Tax, but which rate as also rised under the Queen's igin manual, and the oyal rrant for the last levy of thatind was now proMr. Norton, for the complainant, contended that this 'Was no answer. The defendant's own contract contined the usualbuilding clause, bywhirh he was bound to give the notices, and such would not havo been inserted if Be had been exempt from the operationof the Building Act. The exempted buildings, too, were specifically set forth in the schedule totheAct, and such *abuilding as this was not in. tluded in he exennptions. There was edno to show that the building wa uder the Crown, or that the expenses of the armns and accoutremnents were defrayed by Gevernmnent.
Mrt. Smith on this demanded to be sworn, and, having de' Sfmtohbis superintending all the disbursements under the WophyT for 35 yeas, stated that no demand had ever been iadeupon him for the pay, arms, or acomutrements of the London lti durng the whole time, and that he lad been In frequent communication with Lord Panmnre nd Colonel 1Ppon in thematter, and been directd to hasten the completion of the bsiiiding,a; thepresent he&d-quarterswre' wholl in dequato for their purmpos
* Mr. D'2NsoloUT, at the conclusion of these sttements,: adjourned the "ase for a fortnight, and now, in an elaborate and very careflly considered judgment, in which he reviewed allthe Acts referrea to, laid it appeared to hinmthat tme Crown neither provided nor exercised any control Ioer adch bNildings, but that they were expressly vested in the Commissioners of iaeutenancy, who were not the agents but quite independent of the Crown, and in the same position
as county Minsles empowered to purchae land and erect buildp out of the county-rats, to which tbe Trophy Tax bore a strong resembUance. He conceived, therefore, that thi l bnildingcame xtrietly within the nurview of the Buad. ing-Act, and that the defendant was oaound to give the pre-
scribd noices but,as h badbad ome difficulty in. aCivldngttthisoonclttion andthea poinightbereasonably held to be in some doubt, he shouldonlyiiposthe nominal penalty of ls, together with the costs, which were assesised

AN IMPARTIAL TRIBUTE.-Believing as we do that
Ax IXPATIAL TRIsM .-Believing as we do that the bosties at Canton was pn imolitic and rash proceeding, we cannot but approTe tho deciion of Parliament. The Premier has resolvod to appeal to the oonntry forthwith, so that a new Parliament may re-assemble in May. He puts the qtaestion to the country-WIl2 you let a bagtard Coalition, a Derby.Disraeli-Gladstone-rahmite Govqr,nent
ersome? You may not feel satisfied with the Chinese
may think I sn not sufficiently liberal, suffiiently go*-nead in home politics; but-.we imagine the Premier calmly arguig-I have already done, and yet may do, the State some servle. Which w1i you take-mo or the hybrid Coalition? Grateful for past services, and ad. mring the pluck, the energy, and thorough nationaty of this man, wrho, with all his faults, has, we believe, the dignity and welfare of England aincerely at heart, we can imagine our countrymen replying-"We havenot forgotten yourservices, an we agan frely acept yov. You are thei bestm we can find at preent. We prefer you to the nondescript conglomeration which we shall most surely be, saddled with if wo don't send up really and truly liberal' men to your support; and though we should lko you to show more generous predilections on home question still,
on the grounds statod and on the gounds of admiration and generosity towards a 'great man, who stuck by us at a time of great dnger, when so many public men foully deserted us, and when so many were bespattering praises on or showing a truculent sympathy for our late enemyDisrei an Gladstone amoug the rest-on these rounds we wil give you our hand." This no donbt will be the repl
of the oountfy, and we don't pretend to spak in a spirit of propbecy when we say that the "ins" wlbe " in aain, and the " oute wl be " oout' gin. Withall his failigs -and although grieved. and very unfortunate it is for him at a time like the present that he should hve opposed Mr. Locke King's excoedingly moderato measure of Earliamentary reform in the nonchalant manner which he did-still we canot butconfess to an admiration of the man; and we should not at all regret if the electors of the West Bidin
imitating the electors of London, were to invite hbi Lrdship to receive the honour of which even the greatest states. man Would have a right to feel proud-that of representing the lrgest division In this the largest county in the kingdom a oonstituency not only the most numerous but the wedthiest and moct influentlal in Great Britain.

ELECTION INTELLIGENCE.
MARYLEBOINE.
last evening e. meeting of electors of the borough of arylehone resident in Camden-town and its vicinity was held at the Eagle Tavern, for the purpose of taking steps foI eecuring the re-election of Sir.B. Haal; Mr. Thomas Smina, of Haveretoclk-hill, inthe chair.
Mr. FuRmafi proposed the iirst resolution,-
hat, takig into coiderationthe trield and faithfl - vioes of alr B. Hall dwurg the 50 yeast hehs Wepresented the boroun u rarliament, tbi meeting of electra hereby expresea itt coati aued ODnfigwoo in the right hon. baronet, and Pledges Itself to ate it best en-
saeours to cue his triumphant re-election."
Mr. MORGAN seonded the resolution, aIel, on its being 1p4t, it was carried unanimously amid loud applause.
Sir B. UXL, prese himself, wi received with loud aheering. He roceded to explain his Parliamentary 'endfact. we cod assuw them that the position of a topresentative of Marylebone wss ate sinecure. (Hear.) wVen first elected for that boroug. the constituency of 1darylebone was but 8i30, it now 'tinbored something like =2,'000 electors. He believed that Vheir local interests had uever been negledted' y him (seer, Ihear), and no man in the 'borough wbe aad evee written alleTOer to him could say that ihe had it left for 48 tours unnwered. Afterreferringto the -communications Oiur'ing him support, even from opponents, irom every part df'lhe borough, vie said he felt it his daty to wead 4-letter he hod receivedlifom Mr. Jacob Bell, which -did honour and credit to him. [Mr. Bell's letter stated that ihe had received a letter fomu lord Fortesue acknowledging ,his forbearance in not oppoui2g his son's re-election. It was ;:not'his (Mr. Bell's) intediion to become bis Lordship's oppo. nent again, more espeoiae;ir to take advantage of the present
nstate or his iLordship's henith. He therefore hoped for the -unopposed retara of S0i. Hall and the noble Lord; but if .at the lost nionent, -oz after the election, his Lordship's .-state of health should oblige him to retire, then he should be prepared at any tihn to come forward as a supporter of the Liberal principleeof Lord Palmerston's Administration.] He (Sir B. Hal thought it, in justice to Mr. Bell, 'his duty to read hf letter. (Hear.) After giving his 'reasons for supporting Lord Palmerston on the latevote on
the Chinese question, Sir B. Hnal concluded by stating 'tbat when he found his position as a Minister incompatible -with-his duty as a representative he would retire from that
otion. The right hon. baronet resumed his seat amid ondd plause.
* M r.THO`PER made some observations on behalf of Lord i:brington, and moved the appointment of a committee to "co-operate in securing the return of Sir B. Hall.
Mr. W.;C. MARLEY seconded the resolution, and Sir B. dAll -having explained his opinions with reference to 'he Sunday bands, in answer to a question put to him -upon the subject, which were received in a satisfactory -amanner,
The resolution was carried, and, a committee having been appointed, thanks to the chairman terminated the proceed-
last evening a special general meeting of the Political and Parochial Associption of the borough of Marylebone was -held at the Colosseum Hotel, Portland-road, for the purpose of considering the best means of securing a proper representation of the borough of Marylebone in Parlia- 'lnent.
Mr. Field, the president of the Borough Association, was "calledLto the chair.
*Mr. BRs.smEsAD, in moving the first resolution, said that one of-the first objects which the electors of that borouLgh ought to look to was their own happiness and rights in the maintenance of the principles of local self-government. They ought to vote for no man who would not pledge him,If,to maintain the right of the ratepayers and pooplo to govern themselves. (Hear.) Lord Ebrington had plainly ,told them that he was opposed to the right of the people to -manage their own affiirs; that, on the contrary, he admired
the Toor Law Board, and wished for its extension. Such a *man, he had no hesitation in declaring, was wholly unfitted
to represent the borough of Marylebone. (Hear, hear.) With Sir B. HaU the case was different; he had ever been -a friend of those principles which he believed the electors of
'that borough had so mrch at heart. (Hear, hear.) Mr. Brinsmead then moved the following resolution *-
" That this meeting considers Lord Ebriugton unfit to represent the borough of Marylebone In Pariiament, he being opposed to local selfgovernLment, and pledges itelf to use au its infiuence to prevent his Lordship beingagainreturnel to Parlaneent; ad, farther, wil support sthOse candidates onlY who lvil pledge themeilves to Issen, if possible, the powers of the Poor Law Board."
Mr. Ross seconded this resolution.
A long discussion ensued respecting the resolution, and tItimately the proceedings were adjourned,
LAMBETI.
last evening a crowded meeting was held at the Horns 'Tavern, Kennington, for the purpose of hearing an address 'from ir. W. Wilhams, M.P. forLambeth. Mr. F. Doulton -cocupied the chair.
Mr. W. WILLIAMS rose amid cheers mingled with hisses, :and, after thanking the electors for coming forward in such large numbers to meet him, gave a history of his psst poll,tical career, and said that the most important point was relative to his vote upon the question of the Chinese war. ("Hear, hear," and hisses.) Much had been said about a 'coalition, but he could honestly say that he never told any -man how he intended to vote. If by the vote he had recorded upon that important question he had given offence to any one of his supporters, he could only say that it was -n error of the head, and not of the heart. When he gave his vote he did not think anything about Lord Palmerston or any one else, but merely gave it according to his 4con. *-viction. (Cheers and uproar.)
Several gentlemen having addressed some questions to Mr. Willams relative to his vote upon the Chinese war,
Mr. B. GRovEs moved the following resolution .-
* This meeting, having heard the statements of Mr. W. Williams ,*especting his political conduct during the present session of Parsla.
m3nt. are of opinion that his indefatigable and faithful services in -the Oommons' House of Parlisment eminently merit the thanks of *this meeting, which are hereby most eordiiay tendered, and at the same time express their determination to retmn him to the new Tarliament."
Mr. ELLINoToir seconded the resolution.
Mr. W, aD, amid great uproar, moved an amendment to the effect that the explanations given by the hon. member 'srelative to his vote on the Chinese war were unsatisfactory,
and had deprived him of the confidence of the electors.
Mr. BEERD seconded the amendment.

(Applause.)
' The CHAIRMIAN read the following extract from a letter written by Mr. Bright to his -brother-in-law Mr. Vaughan, -'of the Oxford Circuit, dated Roqie,'Feb. 22 -
A And now about my health. Nbbody supposes that anything is the matter 'vith me, I seem co well; anrd I can do generauy what other Veople do when they are doing nothing but to armuse themselves. I .soa, however, rauch better', reading, nriting, or talking do not hirm me now; end withsome interuptions I feel I better spirits, andas lf time, and not a long time perbas, woUd restore the tone of the ay
*tem. It has been a serrible disappointment to betotns exiled, and at
sucha tine, and vhen questiens of such.interedt are being discursed at home. But I try, not alwayc with succes, to resign myself to what I cannot escape from."
The Right Fron. T. K. GmsoiL then rose, amid loud cheering. In the course of his address, he saud that we wereo.upon the pohnt of a dissolution, said to have been brought about by a resolution moved by his hon. Irtsnd, MIr. Colden (enthusiastic cheers) and .eeconded-.hyimself. (Renewed'cheevs.) But, to clear the ground with reference to rthose charges of conspiracy *Tlaughter) aml of " secrekt-treaty" (hear, hear) witb poitical oppoRents thatl had kseen brought against them, he tegged to asaer*, from his own positive -knowledge, that tnc person in the 13use of Commons knew of that resolutior until it had rmadc its appearancoe.on the books of the House, But why was-iS necessar to submit this resolutior tc .the House of -'Ccssmons? He ;thoughthe could expgair
the matter clearly. The Government informed Parliament ,in the theSpeech om the Throrathat±they ,vould lay onthe table. papers convei6ng full information as to the hostilitiei zwith Chins, ther&-y inviting a .doliberate opinion as tc
*ne course whnch.Lod been pursued. The Government said, " Look atourwsse, and tell es-what vou,think of it.' Xr. Cobdqn and himclf had carefully looked at the case, ,and replied tlhat it was a bad one. i(Cheers..) He wished to be.informedif, havizg come to ihe oonclusien that the 4asewas&-bad.otae,thej had failed .to stake.proceedin -in *ho HouSe of 'CoMmons,otey would have diseharged t ei

When heaiing of "peace at qny price," it sometimes occurred to leins that ihere might lIe a party who were probably tie advocates of "Palmnerston at any priee." (Laughter and cheers-) He had 50 personal anmmoeity to Lord PalLerston ; he would as

UJpon the vhe le, and t the *est, it was a very doubtful case for the Grvernr.sent to have Iren parties to such tremendous bostilities As, had been

He should like to see the Chinese j Government in frequent and amicable tommunication with ! our own. He should like to the rejudicesof the Chinese overcome, and EnglWlhmea permiete3 I hr they pleaed in China; but he very much doubtedj whether these desirable objects were to be attained by such acts as
the bombardment of Canton, which would leave behind I them permanent feelings of hatred and hostility (hear, hear) that years of intercourso would not wipe out. He
was also astonished, if the Government of the day were so I anxious to extend our commercial relations with China, I that they should at the same time be increasing the duties on tea (" hear, hear," and laughter); for, if thvre was one thing more than another calculated to extend our commercial relations with China, it would be to extend the consumption of tea among the great masses of the people of this eountry. If we did not buy the Chinaman's tea he could not buy the produce of our industry. He must pay for it in what he produces; and, at the present moment, with all our grumbling about Chinese duties and restrictions, we had put upon the great staple article of Chinese Produce a duty of something like lla to 120 per cent. (Hear, hear.) He was not afraid of coalition when coaltion was to effect a most beneficial object for the country. (Hear.) He never knewany good thing got without some sort of a coalition. He brought forward a motion for the total abolition of the duty on paper. (Hear.) Where would all great measures be if their advocates were never to accept the support of political opponents? Where would free trado be? (Hear.) What was the use of making speeches in Parliament, or addressing argumentstothe House, if nobodywaseverto be convinced, orif, assoonassamanrwas convinced and was going to votewithyou, that was to be a reason why you ehould abandon your motion? (Laughten) He would says one word about the Budget. He voted against it because the Government proposed to add 4,000,0001. per annum to the expenditure upon the military and naval establishments of the country over and above -what those establishments cost previous to the Russian war. It was his belief that that addition was unnecessary (hear, hear)-that what was adequate to the security of this country previous to the war would be found to be adequate now. It could not be. a desirable thing that a constituency like Manchester should be represented by men pledged to vote black white to keep in or to turn out a party. (Hear, hear.) Measures of reform, of commercial or of religious freedom, would never be obtained excePtbv steady exertions and independence (hear, hear), and if he had the honour of again being returned to Parliament it should be his desire to support measures and not men, as in so doing he believed he should most truly consult the interest, not only of this great constituency, but of the whole country. (Loud cheers, followed by " Three cheers for Bright.")
The meeting was also addressed by Mr. T. Bazley, Lr. H. Rnwson g Mr. W. B. Watldns, Sir E. Armitage, Mr. W. Morris, and Mr. J. Fildes; and it was resolved, that Mr. Cobden be invited to address the electors in the Freetradehall in Mr. Bright's absence.
PORTSMOUTH.
Yesterday Viscount Monck arrived in this borough and issued the following address to the electors:-
"Gentlemen, -The disolution of Parliament will, within a few days, place in your hands the power of selecting membcrs to represent your interests in the House of Commous, and I beg leave to place my bumble services at your disposal. It is now nearly five years since you first did me the honour to elect me unanimously as your represen tativo. During that period I have been a constant and regular al. tendant on my duties as a member of the Legislature, and there bavs been few subjects brought before the House upon which my opinion does not stand recorded In the vote To a comparison of these records with a statement of the Dolitical principles which
made at the beginning of our connexion, and on which that connexion was baseL I fearlessdy appeaL If that comparison does not induce you to think that I am entitled to a renewal of your confidence, no professions that I could now make ought to bave any weight with you. I appear before you as a member of Lord Palmerston's Govenment, and I ask you, by returning me again as your reprerentative, to evince your confidence inthe statesmanwhose appreciation of the blesings of peace has been sbown by bis terminating, immediately that fair terms could be obtained, the great Esropean war in wbich we were lately engaged, while his long and honourable political career is a sadicient guarantee that while he continues mnister ot England Briti.h honour will be vindicated aud British interests WM be protected in every part of the world."
(BY ELECTRIC TELBGRtAPH.)
In the evening Lord honok presented himself at a public meeting at the aliof the Beneficial Society. After the meetng had been addressed by the hon. member and several other gentlemen, the chairman put the following resolution, Dmoved by M. Alderman George Sheppard, and seconded by
'That, in the opinion of this meetlng, Her ?ajesty Governmeat has merited.the entire confidenoe ofithe country, and Lord Monck, as a member of that Government, and as one of the representatives of the borough in Parliament, is worthy of the continued support of the electors.
There were about 150 hands held up in favour of the resolution, and about 1,000 against it. There were from 1,200 to 1,500 persons present. Great cheering and uproar followed this result.
Mr. HOWVELL HOWELL then moved, and Mr. Alderman WI1}TB seconded,-
" That, in the opinion of this meeting, it is not judicious to retmu Viscount Mouck to Parliament, unlees he Pledges bimself to support the extension of the suffrage and vote by ballot."
This motion was carried by about the same number of hands as ignored the first,
AsINGIDOW.-Major Reed, our present member, goes, it is understood, to seek the suffrages of the larger constituency of Finsbury, and the choice of the electors is at present between Mr. J. T. Norris, of Sutton Courtney, and Air. D. H. D. Burr, of Aldermaston-park, Berks, and late High Sheriff for the county. The former seeks the support of the Liberal interest. He was rejected at the last election, when Major Reed defeated him by a narrow majority. The latter was rejected in 1852, when Lord Abingdon, then Viscount Norreys, was returned by a majority of 2L. Mr. Burr then declared himself a firm supporter of Lord Derby. On this occasion he expresses regret at the decision of the House on the China question, and wouild, if elected, take his seat with no hostile feelings to Lord Palmerston, but would be ready to support him when the measures which he or his colleaguesbring forward are such as will maintain the honour and welfare of England.
BATII.-Captain Scobell does not intend offering himself for re-election, in consequence of advancing years and declining health. As soon as his determination was known a requisition was presented to Mr. William Hunt, one of the Liberal aldermei of the town council, requesting him to come forward as a candidate: but at a meetin of the Liberal association held yesterday morning an answer was received from that gentleman declining the proffered honour. The names of Admiral Duff, Mr. Kingslake, author of o2his, and Sir Arthur Hallam Elton were then canvassed; end a deputation was nominated to wait upon the latter gentleman. As yet no Conservative candidate has been named.
BoDAsIM.-Mr. James Wyld has issued an address to the electors of Bodmin, He says:-
"The dissolution of Parliament has bcen haitened by a vote of the House of Commons adversely to Her Majesty's Government, achieved by a strange combination of individuals, who have used the difficulties with the Chinese people as a pretext for endeavouring to supplant the Administration of Lord Pabnerston, and for obtaining the control of the Governnact of the country. The poUtical, personal, and com. miecal relatfona of the English nation exist with every people and in OverY clime, and a bold butjust poucy is necessa for Great Britain, to preserve her world*encircUng Possessions from menace her citizens from insuit, and her commerce from interruption; and while Jam opposed to the unnecesary employment of naval or military force, I would not permit any nation or people upon the face of the earth to offer an insult to our national fag."
MIr. Wyld then states that he is prepared to support many important questions which the late conflict with Russia delayed. Mr. W. Michell and M1r. C. B. Graves Sawle the sitting members, offer themselves for re-election, anu another candidate is spoken of in the person of Mr. Cape Whitehurat.

A canvass of the electors is now being vigorously pro3ecated, both by the Liberals and the supporters of Major Edwards. The Conservatives have been losmg ground on the register for some time past.
HEBEFORDSHIRL-The Liberal interest are determinea to get one Liberal member in if they can, and there is every reasonable chance of success. The feeling is slmost 1unversally in favour of Lord Palmerston throughout the county, and the fact of Mr. Hanbury, the junior member, having voted against the Government on r. Cobden's motion, is expected to tell against him in the contest. Sir Henry Geers Cotterell, of Garnons (a large estate near Weobley), has been rcquested to come forward for the county, and has consented to do so.
KEN'DAL.-Mr. Glyn, the sitting member, has accpted an invitation to become a candidate for re-election, and there is lttle probability of any opposition being made to
hsreturn.
KmDE3n;EsTx-Mr. Lowe has issued the following address
"The Government of Lord Palmerstou has appealed from the cenure of the House of Commons to tbe people, from whom that House derives its autbority. As a candidate for re-election, I look forward with no unreasouable confdence to the results of that aDpeaL It Is msde by a Stateeman who, deserted by many ot his coUeagnes, carried us triumphantly through the lati Russian war, whose frmness secured us an honourable peace and whose iglanoe prevented our losing by artDce wbat we had acquired by arms. That appeal is made against as incongrnous union of the Conervative party with gentlemen who. having faied to drive this country into capitulation with RuBia ro nov seeldg to humble her in the dust before the barbaroos Insolence of the Viceroy of Canton. Having lived mtuch in the foreign dominions of Her Malesty, I feel very strongly the absolute necesity of extendmg a generous support to those whem we inst in remote
countries with British Interegtg and honour. If we do this they wilserve us zealously and ably; but if they feel that their actionsi Will be scanned with hostile ingenuity, and their ungnarded expredons critidzed and analyzed for mere party purposes, they vill become timid and indecisive, and their efficiencsy wlt be Parzed by the dread of unfair and uncandid censure. Whether you approve of every act of our agent, in China or no, I am sure you fVrll feel that they have done nothing which ought to depriTe them of the support of thetr feUow subject, here, and that Lord Palmerston did no more than his duty in striving to shiea them and those committed to their charge from being sacriised to a combination such as we have jest witnessd For myse. I wi only say that I am proua of being connected with a Government which has conisrred so may benefits on the country.
KIN GS LYI.c-Lord Stanley haseissued an address, in which he again offers himself as a candidate. Lord Stanley says:-
" Nearly five yers have elapsed since you lint Invested me with that important trust of which I amnow about to ask a renewal. MypubUc conduct doztig that term is before you: I cannot hope that it has been reefrom error; but I can safely mairm thatl have never given a taotinus or an Interested vote, and that so far as health and stength allowed. I have not neglected the duties of a representative of the people."
There are rumours of an opposition. It is saidl that a gentleman will come forward on "sound Conservative principles."
LANCASTER.-Two candidates are already in the field, Mr. William James Garnett and Mr. Robert Gladstone. The former of these gentlemen announced his intention some time ago of offering himself as a candidate when a vacancy occurred. Mr. Gladstone, in his address, says, speaking of Lord Palmerston and his colleagues.-
I do not think they should ke compelled to abdisate the reins or Government. I approve of the appeal whih Her Majestf's Ministers Intend making to the country, and I feel ostisaed that it wl give an energetic expression of approval to Lord Palmerston's polcy, feelng, as I believe ft does, a deep debt of gratitude to his Lord3hip for past servics, and of confidence in him for the future."
L:xDS.-The only new facts connected with the forthcoming election in this boroagh since the last notice in Vie Times are these :- Sir George Goodman, one of the present representatives, has issued an address to the electors announcing that, on account of the state of his health, it is not his intention to longer represent the borough in Parlia. ment than to the close of the present session. Placards havo been issuned announcing that Mr. W. E. Forster, of Burley, near Otley, and of Bradford, a gentleman of Liberal political principles, will offer himself and the address of the Conservative candidato, M-. Robert HaOl, Recorder of Doncaster and Deputy Recorder of Leeds, has also been published. Mr. HaU declares himself in favour of the hostilities with China being carried on with vigour and effect, but he dechnes, or rather avoids, giving an opinion on the point involved in the recent motion by Mr. Cobden. A general meeting of the electors is to be held on Friday night, to determine who shall be the Liberal candidate to be put in nomination wilh the Hon. M. T. Baines. As has already been mentioned in Ti*e Times, tho Reform Registration intend to propose Mr. F. Carbutt, but it is expected that the extreme section of the Liberals will propose Mr. Forster.
LIzvERPooi.-Mr, T. B. Horsfall, M.P., and Mr. C. Turner, the Conservative candidates, have issued their addresses to the electors and burgesses. Mr. Horsfall says he opposed in Parliament Mr. Cobden's resolution on the Canton proceedings, because he conceived it to be a censure on Her Majesty's Government for adopting measures which he believes to have been necessary for " the defence of the honour of our national flag, and of the lives and property of our fellow-countrymen abroad." Upon local matters he alludes almost exclusively to his past, and promises a future opposition " to the determined and unjust attempt made to deprive Liverpool of the town dues." Mr. Turner, in his address, " sincerely regrets the vote of the House of Commons with reference to the late unfortunate occurrences at Canton;" states that his opinions upon the commercial polcy by-which the trade of the country ought to be rngulated are identical with his opinions in 1852 (whatever they may have been), and records his intention to continue to resist " the attempted spoliation in reference to the town dues." Wixth the sentiments of Mr. J. C. Ewart, MP., the Liberal candidate, the readers of Mie Times are already acquainted. The first public meeting in connexion with the election will be held at the Amphitheatre on Monday.
LonbON.-We are requested to publish the following letter, addressed to the electors of the city of London:
" Gentlemen,-I observe from a report of proceedings of the Liberal Registration Association that after my nomination had been carried some quwetlon was raised byMr. Alderman fslomons (without the courtesy of noticel as tomy declining to vote at the late election for East Sussex.

EIackblock, one of the directors of the City Bank, who is a resident and a well-known and indedependent Libceral, supporting Lord Palmerston on his foreign policy, and Colonel Parratt, who contested the borough at the last general election.
SALISBURY.-It is not likely there wiU be any opposition for this city. General Backley, in his address, says .-
" I lament moet sincerely the ocaurrences which have lately taken place fn China, and could have wished that the Insult offered to the British flag might have been nettled without havsng recoorse to any warlike demonstration; but seeing that all the authorltles on the spot agreed upon one system of action.

DUD .-Sir John Ogilvie, who opposed Mr. Baxter at the last Montrose election, is to be nominated for Dundee, in the room of Mr. G. Duncan, who, as has already been stated, retires.
DUMPRI3s BURGHES.-Mr. W. Bwart has again offered himself for these burghs. His address has been rather coldly received, and opposition is looked for.
EDINnURGH.-Mr. Black, who was elected for Edinburgh about a year ago, on the retirement of the Right Hon. T. B
Iacaulay, again offers himself as a csndidata for tho city, Gith every prosect of his being returned. Mr. Codan who ousted hr. vacaulay in 1847, and weho stil represents the city, has also intimated his intentions again to otnd. VaoS other candidates have been named as likely to come forwvard, but no one has yet taken the field.
GLRSoow.-Mr. Buchanan, the ientleman elected la3t week to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Mfr. John Macgregor, has announced his intention of offering himsself at the a,pproaching general election. There is much difference of opi as to he second set. It is pretty generally desired that Mr. Alexander Hostie, the sitting member should retire, and various local names have been mentioned from whom a successor my be chosen, but as yet nothing has assumed a definite form.
GcoetoCte-Mr. h. Dunlop has intimated his retirem ment from this burgh on account of his vote aainst the. sMiistry, which is elistasteful to the grat majority of the constituency. Admiral Sir lIouston Stewart, Sir HIenmy Eawlinson, Lord Melgund, and several local gentlemen have been spoken of for the seat, hut nothing in as yet decided.
KItwALuv BURGHS.-Colonel Fergnson, who has repro. sented these burghs for 16 years, has announced his intention once mnore to tender his services. He avow s himself a firm .supporter of a Liberal Government, and an opponent of all such unworthy coalitions as that which lately attempted to throw out Lord Paimerston. No opposition has yet been intimated.
KzRKcI)mIGUTrsHIEs.-Mr. Mackie has intimated his intention of retiring, on account of bad health. No successor has yet been named.
LAM.ARRSHRE.-Mr. A. Baillie Cochrane has again offered himself for this county, for which he was elected about three months ago, on the death of Mr. William Lockhart. Mr. Cochrane is generally unpopular, especially for his Neapolitan predilections, and his chief strength Iies in the disorganized state of the election register, and in the favour of the Duke of Hamilton and Lord"Douglas. There is little doubt, however, that he will be opposed. In his address Mr. B. Cochrane says-
"Among the assciations connected with the representation of the county to which I shall ever occr with meot satisfaction is the vote
vhich I recorded on the war in Chins. I humbly and conrelentioua
feel that It was a vote demanded by tvery principle of justios ad bumanity - and while I refrain froraureflecting on th. conduct of others I rejoice that a British Honse of Commons bas ritdicased our national character for mercy and troth. I wil not uphold tyranny or injustic, whether Dractised by our own or by foreign Governments. I hv meeot unfair] been stled an advocate of the. coessee of the Kiog oc the TwoSiciles. On the contrary, so deeply do I lament them that one of my chief regrets at the premature disoiution of this Parliament aries from the clrcumetanco that it must postpone the discusion on Italy; for then I should have demonstratod tat, It I repudiat the ot licay OfHer Mnesl s Gorvernment, It is because I am ssa3ible that itagaae,insta of alleviating. the miseres of those poor pmisonra whose sufferings this nation so jintly deploresp.
Lx' BUrGss.-The Lord-Advocate addressed meetings of his supporters at PortobeUo and Musselburgh on Tuesday, and at both places resolutions were passed unanimously expressing confidence in Lord Palmerston's Government. Mr. Miler. of Liverpool, has been mentioned as a probable candidate to contest these burghs with the Lord-Advocate.
Rs'REwsHIRE.-The vote of Sir Michael Shaw Stewart, in opposition to the Ministry, on the Chinese question, has given much dissatisfaction in this county, which embraces a - strong Liberal element. It is understood that Mr. Cunning-
ham, of Craigends, will start on the latter interest, in oppositihon to Sir ichael.
ST. ANDREW's B1JBGB-Mr. Edward EUice, jun., has again offered his services to the St. Andrew's Bnrghs. He states in his address that he should have been wanting in gratitude to Lord Palmerston for his eminent services to the country if he had, npon insufficient grousls, withheld from him his vote against the parties associated upon Mr. Cobden's motion. He was not altogether satisfied that the extreme measures adopted by our civil and naval authorities at Canton without direct instructions from this country might not have been in excess of thestrict necessities of the case. It was not fair, however, to judge men acting with better means of information than we possessed, and, perhaps, actingunder different impresssons. Bnt the Government had only one course to pursue in the dilemma, itbeing impossible to recede without danger to the lives of our countrymen and destrnction to our trade. Mr. EUice renewis his avowal of liberal and progressive princiDles.
London Destitution.
ZOArDON DBS1'ITUToA.
TO THE EDITOROF THE TIMES.
Sir,-The more fully pubUc attention is directed to this subject the more evident will appear the inequality and injustice of the manner In which the metropolitan poor are dealt with by the existing law.
The case is this:-Every winter a vast amount of destitution is found to prevail in certain districts, particularlythose which are situated on the banks of the river, as Limehouse, Ratcliff, St. George's East, Whitechapel, and Blackfriars, and those the staple manufacture of which draws together a large number of workpeople, as Bethnal-green and Spitalfields. The destitute flock at once to the reElving officersm the oHice magistrates, the clergy, or any charitable persons
el h lend them a helping hand. The ratepayers are taxe to the very utmost to meet the preseing emergency, in some.parishes the rates being over 5s. in the pound, and yet, notwithstanding every effort, a vast amount of poverty is left unreUeved. Last week no fewer than three deaths from starvation took piace in the east end of London, and cases have come under my own knowledge this very winter of persons who have been without food for two days, and in one case for four days together. This has forced the people to go about in crowds and demand relief. Some cases of violence have lately occurred, but in tho winter of 1854-55 many bakers' shops were broken open and robbed of their contents. So great was the destitution at that time that my house was made a soup kitchen for several weeks, and hundreds of quarts of soup given away to save the poor from starvation. and yet at the very time this was occuring the close city parishes and the rich ones at the West-end were free from pauperism and exempted by law from contributing to the relief of their poorer brethren.
Now, the only remedy is to make aLl contribute equaUy to the support of those poor persons who labour equally for the benefit of all. lTh tea, the silk, the sugar, the tobacco, most of the coal, the corn, the wine, and the oiL which all, more or less, use in the enjoyment of life, are -brought to the whole of London throneh the various docks, and pass through the hands of these labourers who are so often destitate. Why should not all contribute their quota to their relief ? There cannot be two opinions as to the rinht answer to this important question.
ut it has been said that there are insaperable difficulties in the way, that it wil lead to ex.travaance, prodigality, centralization, and a host of other evils it the poor-rates bo equalized throughout the metropolis. That must boa weak Government which has not in it sufficient administrative ability to deal with the details of a question of this kind. It is not the duty of a clergyman resident in the thickest locality of destitntion to formr, ' such details; it is surely ^enoug for him to uggest the remedy. The physician sees
the patient, writes out his prescription, and leaves the apo. thecary and the nurse to do the rest.
And yet it would not be very difficult to arrange tbese details. The total net rental of the metropolis is about 32,000,000. per annum. The total expenditure forthe poor last 2ear was about 630,0001. If this sum were laid equaly over the rental the result would give ls. ld. in the pound for the poor-rate annually. But with a more liberal amount of relief, and an annual sum foremieration, tho whole expensewouldnotbe more thanls. 6d. inthepound. There are 36unonsiinLondon, some payingabout3d. and others between 5s. and 6g. a-year poor-rate, tet all these be formed -into one district for rating purpoms; let a correct account of the expenditurefor each7ear b sentintothePoor.Law~Board
ad arate saffieient to meet the amount be laid in equAl portions over the whole area, and be colected by the present
1-cletors ; let the amount be paid in to a treasurer appointedfor the purpose, and let eacn parish draw for its reihef upon that treasure linting the amount of relief to so much per hea of thea&PPlicants, taking the average of the pest *-ei',and allowimgamari of 20 per cent, for more liberal
issiaoe. Thswudb nef ctivececk to extrava. cano, anwoud no tals te maageent out of the hands of te lcalautorites,whoarethebest judges of local clams.If he mout o reiefsholdbe exceeded by any parih, lt te raepayrs f tht paishbe liable for the But if the principle of equalization be onoo adopted, itwil not be a ver a-rduous task to arrange the details. The "rate in a!id" which was levied in Ireland during the famine will ford soime guide;- it answered its purpose, and is in itself a,precedent for equaliztion.
I.All those wise are anxious; for the prosperit of this gret city will do well to weigh this matter carefully before they tejeet it, for a staivin popuation is sutre to be a discontented one, and wide geapred discntent, such as that which now peevails both aemo~m the por and the poorer classes of hatep:Ayers, is Otnrd~tv of th mosat lamentable consequence, a-, Sir. yours &C..

Death Of The Earl Of Fife.-We have to an-
DZK&7 O op E Rum OF F .-We have to announce that this nobleman died at his residence, Duff-house, last night at five mninutes past 11. He is succeeded in his estates and his Irish titles by Mr. James DufT, MLP. for Banffshire. The deceased James Dnff, Earl of Fife, Viscount Macduff and Baron Braco of Kilbryde, county Cavan, in tho Peerago of Ireland ; also Baron Fife in that of the United Kingdom, was eldest son of Alexander, third earl, and was born on the 6th of October, 1776. He married on the 9th of September, 1799, Maria Caroline, second daughter of Louis Countess of Dysart, and Mr. John Manners. By that ady, who died m 1805, he had no issue. The late peer distinguished himself in the Spanish army during the war in Spain and Portugal previously to 1814, holding the rank of Ka'jorGeneral in that servico. He was wounded at the battl of Talavera in 1809, and again, more severely, at the attack of Fort Matagorda, near Cadiz, in the following year. At the conclusion of the war in the Peninsula he returned to his native country to enjoj the large patrimonial estates ho inherited on the dath or his fatherinApril, 1811. Ilis Lordship was for many carsaLordofthoBedchambertothelato Kin Willim IV.
late Erl was, with tho exception of the arl of Aberdeen, the senior Knight of the Order of the Thistle, having had that honour conferred on him by George IV. in 1827. He was nominated a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Guelphs of Hanover in 1823, and was also a Knight of tho Spanish Order of St. Ferdinand and of the Swedish Order of the Sword. His Lordship was LordLieutenant of Banffshire and Vico-President of the Anti. quarian Society of Scotland. The deceased Earl is suoceeded in the family honours and estates in the counties of Banffshire,Aberdeenshire, and Forfarshiro by his nephew, Mr. James Daff, M.P., eldest son of the late General the Hon. Sir Alexander Duff, G.C.H. He was born in 1814, and married in 1846 Lady Agnes Georgiana Hay, second daughter of the late Earl of Erroll, by wvhom he has a youthful family. The present Earl has represented Banffshiro in the HIouse of Commons since 1837, and which boecomes vaat by his succession to the peera¢e.
T~ CoTToN SUPPLY.-IDVXRIOOL,, Irh1.
This afternoon Mr. J. B. Smith, MLP. for Stockport, at. tended at the Cotton Sale-rooms for the purpose of ,expound. ing his vies wvith respect to the cultivation of cotton in Idia,w whence, he argued, we might dlerive unlimited supplies of the raw material of as good a quality and at as cheap a rate as from the United States To effect this there were wanted works of irrigation, rends and means of internal communication, a fixed tenure of uand or leases for long terms or in perpetuity, just laws, and an efficient police. These oobjects might be deinanded of Government, which, in ico to India wau bound to orry them out. hile conferring a benefit upon the country, such a polcy would be the means of filnk the Treasury the return for the outlay being tertain to be twofold. Mr. Booker, a member of the West India Association, subsequently volunteered a few observations on the advantages afforded by other British oolonies, especially by British Guiana. One island (Demerara) was capable of supplying as much cotton as England would require. It was not more than 25 days' sail to England; the cotton-producing district was immediately doining the sea-board; there would, therefore, be no expense for land transport, while the freights would average one-third lass than those from India. At the conclusion of the ad. dremes votes of thanks were accorded to Mr. Smith and Mr. Booker for the information with which they had favoured the mneetin. There was a con4derable attendazce of mer. chants, brokers, and others, and the chair was occupied by Mr. -. Torr, cbairman of the liverAwol ChAmber of Coi.
