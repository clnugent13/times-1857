The house -was uneiceptionable," the ste, as a focus for aristocratic gatheri was not to be, watched, and sO lon as ths ' known doors 'were kept close in . the height of the season one could not help thinkin- there'ivassomething wrong in the aspect of themetropolis. Hence,'whenth long-locked portals were thewn -o,pen it was a natural consequence that the public rushed into boxes, stalls, pit, and gallery, just as air rushes into a vacuum. The delightful singing of Madalwe 'Alboni in Ccnreintote and the successful c6teb of four new danscsucs caused an audience that had come to bo pleased to depart in high satisfaction. The season had started Well. How. ever, old institutions with all their age upon them will not always coimmand enduring respect, and the fact that the herald's tabard; venerable and rnedieval as'it' is* does not necessarily occasion universal idolatry must be fresh in the mind of many of our readers. An old institution may, like an old joke; prove to bea horrid bore. But in the case of Her -Vajesty's The'tre .the affection for the old institution was still in fall glow when a new phenomenon appeared in the presence of MidemolsellePiccolomini. The composition 2nwiuich she: made' her dbfibst was little worth, and the libretto with whichit wa connected was almost repulsive from the physical and phtbisical nature of 'the woes 'vhich it illustrated. This did not matter a jot. The appearance of a young, fresh talent, adorned with innate grace, and free from everything like convention, at once vanquished every heart. without an effort on the part of' the fair'v iarx. :Wo 'vocal actress ever succeeded, more perfectly in~ making her, song go to the hearts of her hearers than ademoiselle Piccolomaini. The song belonged not only to the voice,, but to the face, to the manner, to the gesticulation. The little artist dashed off -her reckless champagne-lyric, and aoccupnts of the stalls wagged their heads in accordance wlit the time; she gave a heart.- broken shriek when parting from her lover, and, lo ! the hearts of forty old hartucis were rent in twain * she coughed herself to death before their eyes, and nothing was so fasinating as the last agony. "Como in aniddie, Ralph I" says the old citizen's wife in Beauniont and Fletcher's njiiit o f the Burning Peatle, when she wiants to see the apprentice act the closiDg scene of a tragedy. " Come in and die, Pic. coloinTwasthe mentalejac ationof many astahchbitus but it -was that he might revive her with potent lunigs and a 'ponderous bouquet. Never was so complete a sympathy established between artist and audience. We could speak very strongly on the subject of this same Traoriatab,ut in some cases figures of speechmust succumb to figures of arithmetic; and it can, we believe, be proved by statistical returns that this particular opera, thank- to M'ademoiselle Piccolomini, has been played for a greater number of nights than any other mnodern work within the same period. La Piflia del Begginiento followed La Traaviata, end was succeeded in its turn by Don Paqasole, and stiRl the Piceolomiii sentiment went on augmenting. Those who had seen her laugh for a very little while in Verdi's lugubrious pro. duction loved to see her smile more permanently as the playful Maria or the arch Norina; and all the terms of praise that were invented for her special account had in them something of affection.' She was called the "lpet of tihe publiec," the "spoilt child," and the "caoa baembina;" and, like a little despot, she ruled the entire season. The dloflt of Mademoiselle Wagner as Romeo in I Montecchiicdi Ca(,utetiw was another grand event. The lady had caused such a deal of talk that everybody was anxious to see ler, and when she first came forward, vith her noddin? plume and glittering armour, great was the effect producea bVy the largeness of her acting and the power and compass of her voice. But still we must consider that MademoiseLle Wagner rather gave evidence of her genius than thoroughly exhibited it inthe course of the present season, and certainly she never became so prominent a figure in the minds of the habiN6ul3 as the younger debutante. The reopening of Her Majesty's Theatre would not have bean complete without the revival of ballet on that large scale which used to delight the patrons of former times. Not only, therefore, did Mademoiselle MarieTa-lionicomingasan addition to the four younger danscuses, raise the'direraiisscaienta to a high degree of' brilliancy, but Le Corsairc, the great Terpsihorean novelty of Pauis, w;as brought out with the same prc1nzfsbe and the ensue scenic effects that had .caused sueh a lasting impres.ion in Paris. The graces of Rosati and the grandeur of the concluding'tablau must still be fresh ini the minds of all vho wiitnessed thern. To note the lustre of the season iu terms composed of its brightest elements, we should set down in chronological order the names of Alboni, Piccolomini, Wagner, and Rosati; but it would be wrong to pass over such excellent and well established artists as I B.- Beletti, Peichardt, and Calzolari, the favourable impression left by. Iadame Albertini, the respectable performance of hIL Beneventauno the highly ~creditable d.blt of M. Rossi, and the universat esteem gained by the conductor, .)L Bonetti. In fact, the whole season has been a "lucky"' season in the fullest sense of the vword. No accident arose to hinder the promises of the programme from being fulfilled to the letter, nor did any intrusive sore throat or sprained aucle ever cause the programme of the evening to be changed. August found that the promises of May wore true, and each night showed that the announcement of the morning was correct. On the " extra nights," 'which will commence to-morrow (Tuesday), Mademoiselle Piccolomini will go once more through lier series of characters, and when these are over the nublic will be left to speculate on the 'fortunes of AL Giabigni, the celebrated tenor, whose engagement for the season of 1857 is already announced,.in addition to that of the present favourite artists.
BOYAL ITALIMAZ OPRPA. The tenth season of the Rloyal Italian Opera came to a termination on Saturday night with a very fine performance of Donizetti's Favorita, the principal characters being sues tained, as before, by hMadamo Grsi, Signors 'ario, Graziani, Soldi,.and Zelger. The opera was followed by "God save the QCueen," in which the solo verses were de-' liveredwith great warmth and earnestness of manner -by Madame Grisi. There was a crowded and fashionaeole st - tendance. - This season has been the biiefest on record, hut, as our readers are aware, there were reasons for its brevity. On the morning of the 5th of March Covent-garden Theatre, till then the home of the Royal Italian Opera, was nearly destroyed by a conflagration, the circumstances connected with which, and the controversies ta which they gave rise,' it isunnecessary to recall. The scenery, costumes, arnd properties, the scores of operas and theparts for the orchestra-aU were lost in the flames. Thus in a few hours the work of nine yearss was demolished; the cumbrous and expensive mitse en scenc of between 40 and 50 operas -was now repre-i sented by heaps of dust and ashes. The engagements and requisite preliminaries' for the forthcoming campaign had been completed, and the theatre wvas to have opened on the' 15th of Aiarch. Such a terrbibe calamity was enough to drive into despair a man of more than common nervej But it failed to discourage Mr. Gye, who, as the sequel showed, was equal to his misfortune. True he encountered sympathy on every side, and in a quarter, -too, where it wasI most needed. The destruction of Covent-garden Theatre had; released the company of singers and.playersfrom their obli- gations; and they were free to carry their servies to ann? other establishment in Europe it might please thein to select. Moreover, had the case been otherwise, MÂ£r. Gye could not possiblyhave fulfilled his stipulations to the letter. It is, then, much to their credit:that a. simple-application ehould have induced one and all of theml to modify terms so as to suit the -emergency, and maInaimouslyzdhere to the fortunes of their burnt-out cirector. One month b Afti the catastrophetho annual prospectus. of the Royal Italians Opera wav issued, and ten days later, on the 15th of. April, to the suiprise of alargenmajorityof themusicalpubliEc, who were not nnnatumally increduoGs, the season began at .the Iyceum Theatre-which had been tastefully dceorated for the occasion-w7ith a capital perform%nce of Verdi's onera . Troratore, i tpresence of Herieety the Qaeen.. It will not be expected, nderthe circumstances, tat the observations we have to make can occupy the space hitherto * devoted to our yearly retrospect. Tlhe programe was'inevitably a modest one, .including chiedy the names ot faniliar works, dispensing altogetler with the rand-and costly operas by Meyerbeer and the French school of lyrio melodrama, and only lolding out the nronisa of a- sinte hovelt;. But, on the other hand, it. must be hcne"i nnnd that everything bead .v be done afresh, anid th~i the productioni of eaeh suceessive open ra otled the united and unreniittag labour of scene-painters coaiumniem, decorator, machinist, man music=-copyist It wiw then am, wonded 1bAt so many oE: thi w,orkis 'anionneed were actuallypreaerted; - and on this heidie think subscribers. have no very strwin ,ccuse for -ompi r t -Out- D *- it of 17, 10 were fort& eo'mink-"z- I 2:zSort S420,-It Se2'saators, R Barqi- d r .Sitlglik, TI .'uritani,-2 Arnna, Dan Giovann4i VF'l.!d'WA6ocr, l.ucrezia3 :B 2r,-igolefto,-and La Farorit_ll of which were pliced upon the stage in a style of eleg,pce amd completeness the more 5raisesworthy when the peculiadifficulties of the situitioi are considered.

Just now we should be a littl&>charitable; , If- sevin out of 17 operae' ;were stponed until' a noz favourable occasion, one onlywas-nssingfromn the promised list, ofaits. w-ate,nevertheless, was almost equal to seven o ordisiina-.weight;'re suean Iablache. " v' e Lablache2" might form theppropriate burden of a covatina; so oftenshas the question been Wsed during the last -three months within the precincts of theRoyal Italiin Opera; Iablache,' hoivever, kibe the rest of us, rnust submit to his sbhre of the iDs that flesh- is heir to; and if we -have been rightly vnformcd the great basso has been sufferng from a malady which deprived him for a time of the aiie of his legs, and rendered a season 6f. repose absolutely indispensable. That he maysoonbe onhisfeet aeam is the genuine lash of.every lover of Itlian Opera. In this dearth of great talents such aenan can ill be spared. On the whole, a reconsidiration of the efforts of the principal singers during this short and -by no.means uninteresting campaign is accom panied by reflections in-txhe highest degree satisfactory.- Their devotiontothe theatre was not merely evinced in the sacrifice of a part of their -emolmments, but in the -manifesiation of unusual industry aid. zeal Thus, while we have no newr fact upon which to d tell,no nlea opera, successful or unsuccessful, to refer to it IS at leasb pleasant to be able to bestow a few words of well-merited compliment upDn artistsewho, having long enjoyed public favour to the, fullest extent% never perhaps before proved themselves sc. entirely worthy of it. Without being invidious, we may at once name Signor Mario as an honourable instance. Mario's singing this year hasu surprised and delighted subscribers ailmost in an equal measure. His first appearance-when his voice failed him after-the prologue of Lucrezim Bogiaj,and dispelled the expectations raised by his exqusite. delivery of "1 Di pescatore - ignobile "--was ominous - of, future disasters. Bat thoomen proved deludve; from that night to the end of the season xario was never once found wanting. As the'Barbiere, I tagoktto, and the 'arorifa were alternately zroduced, be sng better and better, maintaining besides his reputation as one of the most consanm - mate actors thatItsly has-sent to En"land. Ile further did good servicein assumini the -part of Manrico, when, after the departure for RioZ aneiro of the popular Signor Tamberlik, at an early part of the season, it Troratorc, bat for Mario, must have been vwithdrawn from the biLs-to the detriment of the treasury. Of this impersonation we need not recapitulate our opinion^; Manrico has been universally .pronounced oae of Ins most admirable performances. We must not separate from Mario the ever eager and indomitable Grisi, who came out as Norma with renewed energv and vigour, appeared frequently as Leonora (La Parorita) and Lucre;riaBorgia, in both of hirvch she is still incomparable, andresumedher famous part of Elvira (I.Puritani) with eminent success. It i-as a pity that tothese could not have been added Semiramnide, Deademona, and AnnaBolenasince, as was hinted last year. to conEne her eternally to "the sickle, the cloister, and the cun of poison," is as unkid to Grisi as it is unfair to her adimirers. It is scarcelypolite, and, indeed, not exactly just, to alulde to the continued " improveneut" of Madame Bosio, who at the present time is neither more nor less than one of the most accomplished vocalists living, second alone in the execation of florid music of the Italian school to Alboni,-and enjoyingat the same time the evident advantage of asoprano voice-wrnch is queen to the regal tenor. Nevertheless, Madame Bosio .iss improved since last season, and the mere fact that she is always progressing leads to the conviction that she is always studying-a practice from wlhich no honest counsellor would endeavour to dissuade her. Madame Ecsio has sUng this season with unvarying success in six operas-.Rigoleeto (Gilda), the Barbiere (Resins), Donz Giora7nnf (Zerlina), the Corste Ory (Countess), the Riisir (Adina), and ni Trovatoe-e The part of Leonora in the lsst--Verdi's best-was allotted to her after the enpiration of M3adame Jenny liey's engzagement. - That Madfame Bosio would execute the music brilliantly no one doubted for a noment; but few anticipated that in the dramatie realization she was not merely to eqo but to e-lipse her.Teutonic predecessor. The passingilusion to Don Giovanni brings Signor Ilonconi to mind, and while we finano reason to change our opinion of his unfitness for the represent-ation of' Mozart's profligate hero we have only to record his legitimate triumph in every otner character he attempted. A bare catalogue of his assumptions wi3l suffice to conjure up their surpassinig merit to the minds of those among our readers who are in the habit of <attending the Italizn Opera: -R5g letto, Figaro, Dnule Alphonso, Dulcamara. Extremes meet here, and no mistake; but Ronconi's aptitude to represent high tragedy and low comedy, or fare, -with equal felicity, is notorious, and a proof of the-versatility of his genius, In the prosperous season of 1855 Ronconi did not join the company of the RoylItalian Opera; his appearance in a time of uncertainty and gloom was therefore the more propitious, and happily-illustrated the adage of " A friend in need." Signor Gardonm, an escellent artist, and a favourite in the bargain, has proved himself this year estremely useful, since, in addition to his admired performance in thte Con's Ory, be lightened the resporsibiLities of Signor Tario by assuming with great talent thalt gentleman's favourite part3 of Arturo in the Pue-jtani, and -atoned for the loss of Signor Tamberlik bym dertaingthat of Don Ottavio, in wvhich he acquitted himself scarcely less to the satisfaction of subscribers. Signor Graziani, the barytone, confirmedthe goodcimpressien produced last season, and his beautiful voice always conferredpleasure in the air, "Ilbalen." of the Tr-oratore, and the romance of the Elug of Castille, -"A. tanto nmor," in La- F,noi-iIr. Madame Xantier Dieidee by the united force of ability and perseverance has rendered herself invaluable to this establishment, and so won upon the good graces of the public that it soolbs dangerofs to think of replacing her by any other contraito. Her performances ass Ragonda in the Cemle Ory, oragdalen in RieletIo, ero., need only to be mentioned; butherhighly successful portraiture of the Gipsy Aoucena brought her at once inecontact with the Visrdots and Albonis, and matedially enhanced her reputaition as an artist of h iher pretensons. Madame Didi6e, although she has acquired great professional experience, has, moreover, the sdnent -advantage of being young; a flattering prospact therefore lies before eiar. Mademoiselle srai. a cAmpsaimeraies "n,o lrigne,"tadmirablemin Adalgisahand characters still more difoicult frTh m ap muasic point of view -like Isoliero, the page in the Conbc Ory-is also quite equalto undrtake "irt businss" on anemergency, ith credit to herself and satisfaction to the audience. Thois was placed beyond a doubt-eu the first night of L'Elisfr d' A 7orc, when, MNadame Bosio being ill, MIademoiselle Mraral played Adina with remaerable talent and success. Sach- a sncanda donnia is precious. The appearances of Herr iFormes owing to sthe operas of cr cyrieer being unavoidably laid aside for a period, have been rare.- is s pOarts fo Oroveso and Baldassare (in w ieha e and tr d waroritn) were transferred-wmhy we are anable to explain -tor h Zclger. The Peutmrii, Don pa ionani, and s adeoierc, if we e are not mistaken, are the only operas in which the German iasso nles sung tcie year. ts Bastito can never fail to stril;e as a characteristi piece of dry humour, while his LeooreUlo forhistrienit conceptionhasyettore surpassed. Of Signora TagiaÂ£co Tand folonini we have o Sny to record what hams been rerorded season aftervseasoninitheanal iceasradi. -whatever these gent.lemen have to do, be it smaU or great, they take the tmost pains if th, anthis, added to their thorough competence, makes their value to the theatre inestimable. In certaln par , too, it is probable that they could not be replaced ithout loss; and among these it is suficient to cite the Cotmendatore and Spawafucst of Signor TgEiafico, the Masetto of Sitnor Polonini. Two new comers Madsmoiselle prosa aevlles and Signor Ntaioaoaldi-wern -both favourably received, but we must hear more than the DonnatAnn of the soprano and the If morino of the tenor to enalle us to judge of their respective mnerits as dlramatic singers. The band and chorus, thoughb reduced to meet the proportions of the Lyceum, have been in no wray less^ effective than. what we have been accustom-sd to at the Royal Italian Opera; bmtothiswss pretta sureto be the ase with Mr. Costa as musical director, and therefore astonished nobody. Besides, there was in these departments a wel-earned repu tation to maintaf-n reputation not to be trHifed with, indeed, on any consideration. The ballet, but for the admirable dancing of Mademoiselle Cer-ito, might be dismissed -with a word. EWthl such a talent at disposal not a single noveltywas produced-the, ballet of Esfu, revived on the opening night of tlie season, retaining its place in the bills to the end, -with- the variation of an occasional direrisscecnten for the clever MIademoiselle Esper. -This-was neither fair to - Mademoiselle Cerito, nor judicious as a matter of policy. There was lL Desplaces to compose a, scenario; Mr. A. Harris to put it in action; Signor Panizzn (composer of i-a), or Mr. Alfred Mellon (condictor of the ballet), to write the music; and one uf the most popular of dunnuses to assume the principal part. We cannot, therefore, i d any excuse for such indifference. The subscribers must have had enough of Eri and to spare -if -not of Ccrito, wrho ws c-orcaplled. mdgra elk, to perform, night after- night;-theself-same evolutions for their entertinment. :-_ - we have reason o believe tbat this short season has boen successful beyond auticipation,and that the concerts at the Palacs'of Crystal, as weRl as tlie performances of- MaK me Ristori-wbich, thocgh tunconee with thesulscrip6on forme parts of theoginal scheme-have done mni to 'help the -manageme t out of' its unforeseen dituittiesm Where the perforces of theRoyal Italian Opera ara destined to be resweed next seaso w are unableX o ixform onr readers ; all we em state with oertainty is t.aat, one or two excepted, the artists have already renewed tieir engaments, and thatthe theatre oftheir next exploi will notbe tbeyvceum.

THEATRICAL XO 'A=IESs.-I- l has never bee6 thooght nnfair to apply to the tasto and morals of a people the touchstone of their publie amusements. These formtlie sphere in which a nation is least controlled by circumstances independent of its choice, and in which its real synmpathies and tendencies may be expected most freely to s-how. theniselves. Eovw happens it, if this is t,rue, that the class of 3amusements which ought most vividly to redlect national character, and which at other periods of our social develojpmnent has done so, should be gradually nsaunmsng-among tes here in London a mere e-otic and certainly-more~immoal. tone ? Thle favourite opera of the season has been La li-- viala, the favourite play has been. Risribaiion. The highest soCiety in England has thronged the operahonseaght after night, to see a very young and innocent-looking ady per senate theheroine of an infamous modern French -novel, who varies her prostitution by n frsntid ptassion suddenly conceived for one of her numerous lovers, and is breught np to the modern standard of intense interest by dying of consumption on th'e stage. -If the music had been instinct w;ith genius, soehn iht have boeen said on the score of artistic heasaty, thougla morality would h-r.e barred the appeal.

LOYZDOIY, MONDAY, AUGUST 4, 1856. It seems strange enough that in this free country, famous chiefly for skill in polities and for sucoess in plantirg its race and institutions throughout the globe, the service of Government should enter so little into men's thoughts vhen, at the outset of life, they look about them for a career. Hrow seldom do parents or fiiends in their advice to the schoolboy hold out to him the honours andpromotions of a public departmcnt as an incentive to exertion ! For the great inultitude of the active and energetic there is business in its -nmany forms, the prospect oI gaining a con petence or amassing wealth in tho ivalks. of private life, without anyr her interference with national affairs than is involved in sitting on a jury: or administering primary justice as a town magiatrate. Then there aro professons, more or less well paid, for the ambitious who will take their chance. Considering that the b'r, as a body, probably spends more than it earns-that the ihurch, without some 'private fortune or positive assumrance of preEerment, holds out but a hard lot-that in medicine the extensive practice, 'vith its rewazds and fame, is a rare prize, it is wonderful with what an unThiling stream the educated middle lasM swell the old legitimate professions. For them the publie school, the tutor, the university give their instruction; through hope of success in these men of genius, education, and energy are content to pass the flower of their youth in severe toil andl stll more wearTr waiting,-.with what -results of disappointment and bittemnems is. too well known. Yet, whether the EngILshman looks to business or professional life, he still thinls only of a private career. It is. not as. in some foreign, countries, where a man must form part -of. the niachine of State or be content with inferiorifty. Hlere p&ple by nillions are content to be among the governed, leaving public affairs to he administered by whoever may gain access to thenm and seize on those crumbs, of patronage which it is not allowed to everyone to reach. Such has been the state of things in England, and such it is even now; bat already there are symptoms of a great change. People begin to recognize both their rights and duties. In the first place, tho professions are overstocked, and there is a yealy increasing class of men issuing frnim our improved places of education, who are by culture and tone of mind averse from the pursuit of trade. The public service of the present day, requiring no mean powers of mind, and presenting, if. not the prospect of wealth, yet the certainty of a maintenance, the assurance of an honourable and perhaps a high position, together with the chanec of great influence for doing goad andu the gratification of a praiseworthy ambition, becomes more andmore " a greatfact"to the community at large; and not only are a more higahly endowed body of men anxious for admission into official life, but tho public, which cares only for the proper adminiistration of its affairs, is disposed to second their aspirations. The nation at large feel that they have stood too long apart from the proceedings of the official world. The inhabitants of a country like ours cannot safely look upon themselves merely as individuals thrown together by chance, and only concerned each man with his own pursuit of wealth or pleasure. They cannot be content with merely demanding security of life and property and the repeal of restrictive laws, leaving a limited class to carry on the business of State, and to preserve its power at the price of occasional concessions and the use of a conventional language of liberality. The country must be governed not onlyfor,but by thepublic; andthatnot merely at certaincrises,byoutbreaks ofnationalfeeling,havingthe character almost of an insurrection, but constantly, regularly, and in detaiL A great step towards such a resulb is the opening of the Government offices and the chances of a puiblic career to men recommended only by superior capacity and diligence. Whether we look on the change as affording fit employnaent to meritorious individuals or as insuring for the State a better discharge of necessary duties, we can hardly doubt the benefits it -will confer. One part of the reform may now be considered as achieved; the victory is half won; the service is, or will be, completely opened, and we doubt not that in a year or two the event will exercise much influence on the habits and education of the country. It remains to perfect what has been begun; the internal organization of the departments must be modified in accordance with the spirit of the new system. Attentive inspection of conduct, conscientious promotion of desert, selection of the beat men for important places without regard to age or connexions, are among the duties of the statesmen who will superintend the various departments. In no branch of the service will a deficiency in these duties fail to be hurtful; but we may cite the Colonial-office as a department where there is the widest field for a bold reformer. Hitherto it cannot be doubted that the distribution of the highest patronage has been distinguished neither by patriotism nor judgment. The frequent changes in the office of Colonial Secretary, coupled with many of the appointments made, would almost seem to intimate that each Misnister was only anxious to embarrass his successor by giving him the moat narrow and impraeticable men in the country to deal vwith. Lately the necessity of conciliating independent colonists has led to the substitution of better men in certain places; Canada, Jamaica, and lstly Victoria, have had good Governors, and now, we believe, Sir H. BARIKY is to be succeeded in Jamaica by Governor DAsRoG of Newfoundland, a gentleman who has acquitted himself ably at several posts, and who commenced his career in the colony he is now to govern. But still it cannot be said that the vast machine of colonial government has been worked on any sound and intelligent principle. The separation between the Administration at home and the Staffs of the various colonies seems to us to be prolific of the same evils as the analogous practice at the Foreign-office. Men who have worked in North America, the West Indies, and Australia, are never brought to London to assist the Secretary of State with their practical knowledge, 'while the officials at home seldom receive advancement to posts abroad which, from the insight they have gained in the administration of the colonial system as a whole, they could fill with a better directed energy and a larger breadth of view. In fact, the local and what we may call the Imperial administration have always been considered as two distinct careers, though it is evident that if we are to retain the idea of the British empire as a unity the relation of the colonies to the mother country and to each other must bo the highest and most necessary study of those who would administer the affairs of those dependencies. We cannot wonder that a race of men placed at a distance from the governing country, with no political responsibilities, and engaged chiefly on the material concerns of life, should often look at things with a narrow and somewhat selfish view. rTiough Canadians, and Australians, and Cape ColIonists are, we believe, soundly loyal, though they respect and love the mother country, as we have had good proof in the late war, though they fully appreciate the generous and self-denying iolicy of EngLand, at least in the present generation, it is no matter of surprise that they should sometimes forget their correlative duties, and look only. to the advantage of themselves and their own territory. The part, then, of the Britbh Governor and his subordinates, the sole reason why they should be Englishmen, and not natives of the colony,, is that they should intelligently ard effectively correct these aberrations, and impress on the colonists how far t4ey should sub-, ordinate their own impulses to a patriotic and largeminded Imperial policy. To do this fittingly what education is so neeessary as that of the Colonial- office at home, -where a man becomes acquainted with the, various characters and wants of many communities, and is able to show those whose way- wardness is only the result of their want of information how the - rights they demand may be wrongs to their countrymen in some other part of the globe, or inconsistent with the wellbeing of the mother country, which has created andwkhichdefends their society? Yet, how ofte'ii htherto hasa General or a Post-Captain been sant 'out, who hardlyjknovrz'a British colony when he SeeJ its name, -much-less .he relations of the 'arious, -derendencjes to the mother country andthe policy which it'bhs been the desire of the .most 'eminent tat;esn en to uphold !. Surely one of the men 'ho hlashelped o adminiister' from London the affairs of somIe50 of these comnmunities must have learnt- something' which. will make hii nmore6capable than a military or political partisan wlSo knows nothing of coonial or any other government? Ana surely when a governoror local- secretary, has been:, in a colony for years he must have somethingp to tell the department at home which is worth' listening"*-o, a-d miight be fairly purthased by an appointment on the central staff? Now that -we are really getting superior men in the public service, and testing them by severe examination and training, it is_ as `e11 to turntlieni to -taccoit n; 'for iaeither th6v nor thhe pubik wl long suffer that they should d- have' no better tortune than to labour in obscurity for 'the glory of their ffilcial 'chiefs.
- The last weel; has witnessed and the present week will witness again, banquets and ovations in honour of the troops who haye returned from the. Crimea. Al the great provincial garrison towns will have soon exhausted their gratulations to ihe soldiers who have resumed duty within their walls, and the series of hospitable greetings will, we believe, be crowned by a tribute from the metropolis to the Guards who have so long constii tuted its ordinary.garrison. All this is as it should be. The country is nt so munh discharging a duty as protecting its o-n interests when it does honour to the men who bravo the hardships and privations of war. Happily, free from the continental burden of the conscription, it recognizes the strong claim upon its gratitude of men whose voluntary and unforced devotion, blended with an admirable discipline, preserves the credit and character of a kingdom, the vast wealth and possessions of which are so signally contrasted with the slight material instruments of their protection. Rising from the torpid slumber, in which war was long dreamed an impossibility, and repelling that paradoxical fanaticism which denounced even self-defence as a sin, the towns and corporations of England attest at |once their ecognition of an obvious truth and their sense of high desert. They attest also something else. They demonstrate a change in popular sentiment and popular prejudices most strildng and most fortunate. Can any two phases of feeling stand out in more distinct contrast than that which greets the return of the British army jfrom the Crimea now, and that which greeted the return of the British army from the Peninsula in 1814? Yet what were the achievements of the two? The present army comes back- from a campaign of two years-two years fraught indeed with great toil, trias, sufferings, -and mortality, and eventually crowned by no unworthy consutmmation. The former returned from a cam,saign of sis; years, in which " they had won nineteen "pitched battles and innumerable combats; had made or sustained ten ,ieges, and taken four great "'fortresses; had twice expelied the French from " Portugal, once from Spain; had penetrated " France, and killed, wounded, or captured "200,000 enemies, leaving of their own nulaber "40,000 dead, whose bones whiten the plains "and mountains of the Peninsula." Yet the present army is cheered, flted, and embraced byaccompanying thousands,whMle their predecessors(with | some few exceptions) resumed their garrison duities wvithout show, pomp, or salutation. In the language of the historian whom we have ahready quoted, that " war terrminated, and with it all "remembrance of the veterans' services." Y Many reasons miight be alleged for this change. The army was unpopular because it had been employed as a police in times of civil commriotion. It was unpopular through the retention of some hazy, constitutional doctrines, about stauding armies. It was unpopular because certainly since the death of WoLFE, andcalmost since the time of A&ALBOROUGH till the beginning of this century, it had performed no brilliant achievement; and what it had done under WEX=GTOr in Spain was depreciated by faction, or misrepresented by ignorance. And W-XGTroN's domestic policy, founded upon that extreme caution which sometimes is as dangerous as temerity, perhaps tended to confirm this unnopularity. By keeping soldiers " out of sight of " the people" as much as possible he rather strengthened the suspicion that a soldier's calling was at once cheerless and disreputable. The popular notion of a soldier in England was for a long time that he was a sort of refuse man, kept in a fusty square, to be alternately drilled and flogged, and exhibited as little as possible, save for the suppression of riots. The identification of the whole ommunity with the military oalling was wholly abaent from a people who saw very little of soldiers Tuder arms, kmew little of the extent of empire committed to theircustody, and who associated their " trade " with the recuiting sergeant's blandishments, the drunien promise, the painful parting from laome, the canteen, and the cat-o'-nine tails. Cause and effect, as usual, reacted on each other. A bad name was given to the soldier; and it was too often from the worst men that soldiers were recruited. Decent labourers groaned over the son who enlisted, and a decent housemaid had rarely the moral courage to retain a " sogger"lover. But, as public attention became directed to the state of the army (which, of course, was done by civilians)-as India was twice seri ously threatened within three or four years, and saved mainly by those brave troops who carried the pluck and vigour of Englishmen to " the heig,hts of Can" dahar and the sands of the Punjab"-Ias the huge miLitary resources of Continental States forced upon the British intelligence their wonderful aptitude for foreign aggression or domestic subjugation-there came over then minds of the people a compunctious recollection of important services in war recommended by the most docile discipline in peace, aud the army gained in popularity. Then came the Russian war, and with it an innovation which starled - others beside military martineta-the aimost daily publication of every event thlat happened within the camp. The English public were Inade spectators of a siege 3,000 mniles away. They saw not only the salient and exceptional actions which lend life and briiancy to the monotony of a siege, but every incident of the soldiez's life-his toil in the trenches, his watches, his hlungers, his fastings, his iaIndness; his disease. They, apart and comfortably housed, saW their gallant countrymen enduring with heroic constancy work which required tllrice as nany hands as could bo spared to do it, and, irn the face of shot, shell, stinted rations, famine, and infection, maintaining an heroic devotion and a disciplined subordination worthy of the race whose sons had calmly mustered to parade on boarde the doomed and sinking Birkenhead. Every househo7ld in the kingdomn thus became, as it were, spectatrs of the sufferings aund the glories of the camp; and the enthusiasm which eachstag of the siege haa kindled burst into that flame which now greets the disembarking trooDpi in England. All these demonstrations are as wisc and politic as they are just and well-merited. The country is bound to recognize the fortitu(le, discipline, adll endurance of its soldiers. But we would fain ap pend to this admission one remnark, which we trust 'ill not be: iniiously i.terpreted.. No one can esstim!ate more$ihig,hly thanl ourselves' the courage and enIranoe oF B3ritish soldiers, or the pluck of the tygimentsloffieers2 WB - particl inp every.: aenuti:nerit expressed ,townrds WiN-DHA, SaraLay.,' 'Yz'EZ, and_" Redan LMassxy t zbutwe -would enind ithoce 'who are-'aboutt to entertaiu the 'returned regiments that there in such a tuing as discrimination iun praise. The other day, at Sieffield, a apea'ker. eulogized the 4th: Dragoon Guardcs for their - conduct in the trenche. This was, absurd ;- and <absurd or inappropriate laudatian is indirect ceihaure. Again, we would remind- these enthuiaatic hbsts that there is a continental as well as au English account of the campaign,. and that the contiental historymakes much lees of the English achievements and much momref the French than, we do.+ Perhaps3 'this, is partly qdue to a studied depreciation, of England;a bt it is also3, in part due to theactual state of thing. - Tho French -had during -the presures o,E the- siegea "ery much force than we d had, , - prOplaOger, a ver- much larger corps of Engineerx than we' had; midA the -two anagea threw upon their rhoulders a heavier- and more comprehensive utyu than our smaller amy' could' have been ex-- pected to perform. Again, we lost our best and oldest aoldiers in the fearful winter of 1854. The principal French losses were at a much later period. FinaUy, the crown3ing operation of the campaign -t_he taling' of the Malakhoff-was done by French, not by English, hands. All this may be palliated and e2plained, but the fact remains. It is true that our Engineers were set to work for which they were numerically disqualified. It is true that the men in -the trenches did double or treble daty. It is true that raw recruits at 'the Redan behaved with gallantry and courage; it is true that the conduct of Wm-rmx and EYRE was worthy of any army and any conflict; still the awkward fact remains that latterly the greater portico of the siege devolved on the French, and that the capture of the Malakhoff 'was a French achievement. We mention these things to put our civic rhetoricians on their guard against an exaggeration -vhich might provoke hostile or contemptuous criticism abroad; and there is no need of such rhetoric, for the true merit of the English soldiers consists in their having remained steadfastly at' thesir appointed workl when their numbers were awfully thinned byfamine, pestilence, and death, and in their having maintained against these unsparing foes the same determined aspect With which they met the Russians at the Alma and Inkermann.
The recent assizes have unfortunately abounded in cases of child-murder. Ucnder ordinary circuinstances it- is impossible not to feel the deepist commiseration in such cases for the prisoner--for the pcor distracted mother, who, in the midst of the direst agony to w.hich the humanframe is subject, finds herself tortured at the same time with shame and the dread agony of exposure. In by far the largest proportion of these cases the wretched creature is a young woman in service who has fallen a victim to the passions of some ruffian, and is left by him to her fate. Time creeps on, and the moment at length arrives which, with all its suffering, brings so manch of happimess to women more fortunately situated, but which almost of necessity seals the ruin of the poor seduced girl. She can look for littlo assistance or sympathy from her maistress or her fellow-servant they wll be the farst to turn against her, to spumn her from the door, to proclaim her disgrace. It is out of the question that she should reeeive medical aid at a tine when it is so needful, for that would be to court disclosure, when, as she conceives, she must conceal her fault or perish in the endeavour. Row terrible mnst those last hours be when she is staggering about the house, endeavouring to disch3rge her duties and to put off the evil momenit until all is quiet and the family have retired to rest ! She must stifle every groan and outward symptom of distress, lest the attention of others should be aroused, and -when the first faint cry of the new-born child which should bring joy to her heart breaks the stillness of the night it conveys to her nothing but fresh cause for alarm. What wonder is it if, either in the clumsy and agonized attempt to procure her own delivery, or afterwards, in the midst of her terror lest the wailing of the child be heard, she tak;es the quickest method of securing the silence on which, as she conceives, her safety depends ! GOD forbid that such pleading as this should be admitted in justification of so foul a crime as that of child-murder ; but the common sense of maunkind practically admits it in extenuation. Unless the case be deformed by unusuatl features of premeditation and atrocity, it is almost impossible to get a jury to bring in a severer verdict than that of " Guilty of cona"C ealing the birth."' All persons who have been so unfortunate as to be present at many trials of this description must have remarkeci that the judge, the counsel on both sides, and the jnry are, as it were, irt a conspiracy to procure the acquittal of the poor creature who stands sobbing at the bar. The puniehment which has faZlen upon her is already s& terrible that human justice can do nothing more. Whatever the cause may be, in ninety per cent. of such cases a conviction cannot be obtained, and the prisoner is dismissed with an almost iaominalpenalty. If merey be confined within the limits suggested in the above remarks society has no great reason to complain, but it should be -clearly understood that commiseration stops short with the mother. If she is not absolutel1y pardoned, she is at least not severely .punished, because it is admitted as a presumption that in her agony she was scarcely responsible for her own acts; but when any other hand than her own violates the I temple of life and deprives the helplem infant of its frh existence, then' wa ought unlsparingly to visit the murderer with the highest penalty Inown to the law. Now, a Cornish jury the other day-it was on Thursday of l3st week-most grossy failed in their duty to the public, and delivered one of the most sandalous verdicts on reord. At B3odmin on the ;day. nanmed Aw-N-MIr=aws, aged 32, JTAEs Gzono;, aged 19, ana R.1rIAD JosE, aged 35, were indicted for the wilful murder of an infant born of Arrimwssat Truro on the 27th of March last. This woman was a shoemalker by trade, and had' resided for many years in respectability at. Truro. Her husband died about four yeans ago, and about a twelvemonth ago, in a fatal hour for herself, she met with JOSE, who was a married man. A connexion ensued between Josz and M.aruRws, and she became pregnant by him.i JosE lodged at her Ifouse, and in the same house. lived the prisoner-Gzoaoa and a young womau: named EFm&z Burus, but1 19 years of age, who were also living together in a state of concubinage. iATTE2uWS had an allowance from the pariah, and she feared that- this allowance wouId be withdrawn if it were 3known that: she had: given birth to a natural, cid. About 4 o7clocl; on the morning. - of Tbursday, the 27th of March, 3&TM Ews was seized with the pains of labour, and she went down into the Idtclhen, where slehdelivered herself cf a female child. JOSE came down also to the kitchen,. -and he ca'led to the girl Brrus to come and assist Mm mws in her pain. After some little delay she was admittedI into the kitchen, where she found Mh&rnnws, Joss, and the necv-born babe. GEonlso came down, snd in at litle ihile h o leave the kiihen.-' Aihe going ihe called to Josz to stop tjhe xhild,s erng.. these-two persons hod left t'he kitien fosz lEa lhis finger down the bobes throat, and rtaie jt there for some time, but, A this: did int 'fficer destroylife, he fetched pan, towhich h epoured a quantity-of water, and in it he downed;ihe child. On the evening of the next ay Josx sIid GzoRoC took the ded body in a basket to ,a pod near TEuro. JosE attached a stone by a rccrd to it, andi threw it. irto the p,nd* Oia the 29th of the aame month the body w.ns discovered by a lad who was is in the pond, the. water being unusually 'ow .at.hte time. A coroners inquest was held, anda.verdict was returned of c Wilful; murder againt ome "person or persons unknown." The oame of X&TTsws soon becau-e involved in the -wossg; of t3he neighbourhood, and the end was that -he was examinedc3by a surgeon, and it was ascer tained that she had recently been diveredli In the end Bun--s was admitted as Q-s evadence, and upon her 1tetimony the jrisoncrs wviere convicted. Th s-trange partdof thesty is that the jury foundc JosE guilty, not of niudr4i, but of mauslaughter, GEOsGaw guilty as--an accessory after the fact, and hB ws guilty of concealing the birth. Of the verdicts in the last two caseswe see no great reason to complain. It does not appear that when T.~rEnxws de.sired JOSE to stop the child's crying she intended that he should commit murder-stl less can GEonaE be mixed up ith the more atrocious crime in any direct manner. It is of the verdiet in the case of Josx that we would Epeak with the greatest indignation. The jury had a perfect right to disbelieve the testimony of the girl Busies, and to acquit the prisoner. On the other hanld, upon her testimony they might have brought the mRan in gnilty of murder. The one thing, however, which they could not do without a -violation of every principle of justice and common sense was to believe the v7itness, and yet to deliver! against the prisoner a verdict of guilty of any lew crime than murder. Not only was the act of JOSE murder, but it was one of the foulest mirders upon record. It was perpetrated under every circumstance of maliee and deliberation-it w&z the murder of au infant child by a strong man. The evidence of the girl was so strongly corroborated by the medical witnesses andl by the general appearance of the body that it a is beyond any question that she was speaking the trath. The conduct of the jury should be visited with the strongest reprehension, for not only dcid they set aside the value of the evidence, but they did so in direct opposition to the directions of the judge. It is but fair to add that Mr. Baron MI= dia not shrink from his duty. No blame can rest -upon him if the ruffian Jose was not visited with the full penalty which the law attaches to his crime.

FRANCE. oim-rATP Onw CO ESPO!qflH"yNT. PARLS, FRmnAy, 6 Pa.-. Although the new Spanish Cabinet is sil sileAt as to its plans, the intelligence that reaches n s today witlh respect to them, through a semi-oEecial channel, is of a nature to inspire uneasiness as to t'he future tranquility of Spain. The Governmnent, we re told, considering that to eonvoke the existing Conmtituent Cortes, or a new Constuent Asserably, or the ordinary Cortes of the kingdom, would, mnder present circumstances,be productive of no good effect, biit rather of troublesome complications, will abstain irom any such .convocation, and think of pronlDgating a constitution put together by itself or under its own auspices, andwhiehisto beofanatureto satisfy 01l parties, from the upholders of monarchy and its prerogatives to the partisans of democracy. Such an assurance as this might mak e us believe that the Goddess of Wisdom herself had descended in the palace of Bneuavista to proside at the deliberations of Marshal O'Donnell and his coileagues. lVhia manner of constitution can it be that is thus im:measurably to surpass the results of the laboums of suecessive councils of the nation, comprising, it is sapposed, the ablest politicians in Spain? We may be permittcd to doubt-vrhether the masterpiece, wrhen produced, wrill justify the reputation given to it by anticipation, and its origin alone will render it unacceptable to the people for vrhom it is intended. WNhat matters, it is asÂ«ked, the origin of a constitution, so long as it is a good one? The reply is, that it matters a great deal, for there is nothing all shades of Spanish Liberals have a greater aversion to, and areless prepared to receive favoursbly, than a constitution ocfroye, or graciously granted by the Government, especially when that Government is of the character of the present one and ruling only by the bayonet. None will believe that~ the constitution will fulfil the conditions now predicated, but Vwill rather expect it to prove one of those mockeries of constitutions of which we have examples in Europe, and which are but flimsy veils for dGwnright despotism. But, supposing the promised of&spring of the O'Donnell-Rios Rosas Ministry to prove better than is hoped, it will still satisfy no one, because al will have in mind that what has been vouchsafed ta-day by an act of arbitrary will may, ina similar way,, be withdrawvn to-morrow. Such a constitution offers no security or guarautee whatever, and, as a shield to the national liberties, is the merest mockery. It might, perhaps, be forced upon and maintained for a while in Spain by a man of superior mind and iron hand, but it certainly would secure no permanent tranquillity, and probably its first introduction would be the signal for a struggle. Other announcements which come simultaneously with that of this masterpiece of constitutions plainly indicate the means by which its framers recko:n on being obliged to sustain andenforce it. The Government, we are told, talking into consideration the recent conduct of the National Guard throughout Spain, is indisposed to reorganize it, but talks of forming, by and by, at some remote and mndefined period, a sort of rosewater National Guard, consisting of persons who are qualified by paying a certain amount of taxes-such a force as would never dream of fighting or of giving trouble to any Goverment. COn the other hand, we hear that the army and the civil guardsthe latter a highly-paid corps, composed chiefly of old soldiers, and generally noted for its fidelity to the existing Government, whatever that inay be, are to be augmented. In the present state of Spain these are dangerous announcements, well adapted to revive the smouldering embers of reistance. If it be really intended to act up to them, it had been better to do so without saying anything about the projects beforehand. Perhaps they are put forward as a feeler, but one might almost suppose that it was the wish of the Government to provoke further insurrections, that it might gain strength by their energetic suppression, and by again lettinge loose the troops upon the peoole. 3Enough has surely been done in the way of a blo ady example. Al the details that reach us of the conflict at Barcelona concur as regards its desperate and sanguinary nature and the severe purushment inflicted on the insurgents. The ghtsneg at Madrid was trifling compared *with that in Catalonia; and even when resistance may be said to have ceased the exasperation of the troops seems not, to have subsided. Correspondence from Maadrid, received to-day, states that on the 24th (that is to say, three days after the fighting -was over in Barcelonia) two battalions of Nationals, coming down from the mountains to the assistance of the townspeople, were met in the plain by the Queen's cavalry, and sabred to the last man. It is lo be hoped there wiU prove to be exaggeration in tIhis account. One can hardly imagine anything more helpless than the position of the iU-trained National Guards, suddenly assailed on open ground by regular Dragoons, and doubtless, if the laf;ter wiere disposed to be merciless, few would escape. The 1oss of the army in the streets of Barcelona apnears to have been considerable, a great many oficers having been picked off, and this may have induced the savage retaliation above recounted. For some days past the weather here has been intensely hot, and in proportion as the thermometer rises publc interest in political affairs appears to fall, and is at present but a line above zero. Paris 1 is just now at its very worst, empty of everybody who can get away, and grumbled at by all who can- :ot. People gasp along the blazing Boulevards in vain pursuit of a mouthful of fresh air, and find in lieu of it a compound of tobacco smoke, coffee ume, and emanations from restaurants. 'The itheatres are steam-baths, and rn-attended. The Champs Elys4es, deserted by day, are thronged. by migh by deluded person, w;ho imagine that, beca use they are fields, they must be fresh. The Italian Boulevard is abandoned to boursiers and to desultory foreigners. It is too hot to read a newspaper, and everything one drinks is tepid if it be not iced. Fashionable Paris is out of town, and unfashnionable Paris is sulky at being obliged to remain in it. The Emperor's return is talked of for the 6th. On the 7th, so the gossips say, he is to be at the first repreaentation of a new hallet at the Opera, and on the 8th it is reported that he will again depart-some say for Biarritz, with the Empress and Prince We read in the Courrier de la Gtiroe:- "Bordeaux is about to witness the passage of a great anumber of regiments of infantry proceeding to the frontier of Spin.

SPAIN. Our accounts from Madrid are of the 29th ult. The Gazette contains tho following intalligence:- "The Captain-General of Navarre writes, under date 26th, that Jaca has recognized the authority of the Queen; that the governor has been dismissed and the garrmson relieved by other troops. Albarracin, whichhadpronounced, has likewise submitted to the Government. The junta of Teruel having sent commissioners to offer Brigadier Damato to capitulate on certain terms, the latter replied that he could accept no terms, and that the town must surrender at discretion. General Antonio Mario Blanco,Captain-Generalof Granada,who was I detained by the junta off Jaen, at present dissolved, haS recovered hic liberly. In the night of the 26th a strong column of troops marched out of Granada, in the direction of Malaga, to re-establish order in that town and chastise the insurgents. General Domingo Dalce, Captain-General of Arragon, was preparing on the 28th to operate against Saragossa." It appears beyond doubt that the Carlists have again made their appearance in the province of Burges. They have already stopped several mail and stage coaches, of which they carried away the horses, but they neither robbed nor illtreated the passengers. The band consists at this moment of 14 individuals, well dressed and armed. Another band of 150 men is said to havo taken the field in the Basque provinces, but the report is doubted, the Government having received no infor3mation on the subject. Several insurgents, captred at Barcelona behind the barricades, had been executed, and others sentenced to the presidios. Those who sought refuge in the mountains after the colLision had offiered the Captain-General to lay down their arstn on condition that they should not be molested. A mong those who contributed most to the rebellion at Malaga is Colonel Buceta, who, abandoning his pest of Military Governor of Melilla, came and placed himself at the head of the Malaga revolters. Letters from Barcelona of the 29th inst., received by the Spanish steamer CEl Barcino, announce the execution, on the afternoon of the 28th just, of 17 individuals engaged in the late insurrection. They were tried by court-martial on a charge of having asassinated Colonel Olviedo and six officers of the garrison, taken prisoners during the insurrection on the 19th inst. They were sentenced to death, and were shot three by three. B3arcelona continued to enjoy perfect tranquillity. The accounts received by El Barcino from Alicant, MIalaga, and Palencia are equally favourable. AVSTPJA (FROM OUR OWN CORBEsPONDXNT.) VIENNA, JuLY 29. We learn that the head-quarters of the Commander of the Austrian troops in Moldavia were removed from Jassy on the 1st of this month, and tne assurance has been givc l me here that the evacuation of the two Principalities will very soon be completed; but it will be seen that the Russians will take care to fumrnih the Austrians with a. good excuse for prolonging the occupation. Austria declares that her roops abll not entirely quit the Principalities until the Russians have left that part of Bessarabia which is to be ceded to Moldavia, and Russia expresses her resolve not to make a retrograde movement until the last Arntrian soldier has returned to his own country. Such is the present state of affairs, and such it is likely to remain if the 'Western Powers do not interfere in the matter.. The bad faith shown by Russia in respect to Ismail, Kilia, and Kars is perhaps a kind of justification for the conduct of Austria. The puiblic papers say not a word on the subject of the collision which took place some tirae since at Giurgevo, in Wallachia, but it is credibly stated that the lieutenant who commanded the Austrian baggage-train detachment has been cashiered, and condemned to imprisQnmnent'in a fortress for five years. The fate of the Austrian corporal who Idlled the French soldier will mainly depend on the Emperor Napoleon. The court-martial cannot but condemn the man to be shiot, but his life will probably be spared if the French DIonarch should intercede in his favour. For some time past no dredging has been done on the bar of the Sulina, as the small steamer which towed the machine is under repair. Orders have now been given by this Governient to the war steamer Adalbert, which is lying off the Sulina, to take the dredging machine in tow until the other steamer returns from Constantinople. The " Protectionists" are raising a tremendous clamour against Baron Bruck, who is accused of having recldessly sacrificed the native manufacturers by lowering the duties on woven goods, colonial sugar, and iron. That the inland i-on trad.e suffers from the privilege granted to the various railroad companies to introduce their rails, &c., bn payment of half the usual duty, is certain,but the Minister of Finance seems to be of opinion that the in:terests of the many ought not to be sacrificed to those of the few.- RUSSIA.. (PP.0o OUR BEBinL coDnsR iIMET.) BERLTN, JuLY 3L Count Chreptowitsch, the Russian MIinistor lately accredited to London, arrived at Stettin late on thei evening of ths&day before last-by-the VLadimir, ahd came on to this place the following day. . One of the first affairs of any importance that the new Russian Minister will have to enter upon in our 'capital will be the so-called conferences !ith reference to the affairs of Greece, and m-ore 'particularly to the question of.the succession to -t'ne throne. In the full consiciousness of the more than probable fruitlessness of any deliberations of the three protecting Powers on the subject, it has been decided that :these deliberatioas shall:not assume the appearance of solemn conferences, which so frequently entail embarrassing consequences on the States that take part in them, but shall be called aid 'looked upon as -unbindfiig deliberations, or conferences sans. gy9e. The embarrassment has become sensible at the very outset, when the Russian Government' requested to be informed of the precise object ancl intention of these " conferences sans ghne," in order that its linis ter might be'duly instructed; and the embarrassment was only enhanced when that object' was specified to be the settlement of the succession of the Greek throne, it being notorious.that tne great staumblingblock to the succession '.taking place in the order provided lbythe charter of 18434 is the necessity imposed on. the successor to the ~throne adoptng the Greek faith. For this proviso was not introduced by the three Drotecting Powers into the original constitution oftldngdom; but was enforced ;pon thie .ig by the people mn the revolntion of 1843. The- Ireek nvation, therefore will be one element that cannot be left out of all consideration at the -conferences, -although not represented there. . The Russian Government is not only naturally disposed on religious grounds to dive every apport to this already exiting clause of'the constitution, but -it has, very recently, distmintly intimated -to. the Bafarian Court its intentiori to stand~ by tEat provision. .I believe .this toolF .place on occasion of Prince Adalbert of Bavaria's applicaton forthe haiid of the Spanish ;nfanta. To our Government it mill not be amaater of indifference what the confession will be that -the ruling family in Greece will profess; the Greek will be.unweicome to them, not 5o mueh on account of the increase of inluenc that :Russia would napparently by that means attain in the south-east of Europe as on account of the increased danger; of inqiuetude to Turkey which would arise from the energetic prosecution of the'specific Greek aspirations as regards a Byzantine empire by a people' and Sovereign at unity on the main point of religion. Least of all can it be desirable for us, politically or confessionally, to see this clause of the Greek constitution set aside for the admission of a Bavarian King with a Spanish Queen to , the Greek throne, which is the object at ptesent ai'med at by the French- Government, 'which thinks to secure itself the goodwill of both Courts by striving to remove -this confessional obstacle 'and favouring the pretensions of Prince Adalbert of Bavaria and the Spanish Infanta. It must be borne in mind that Prince Luitpoid of Bavaria, although he has very distinctly and repeatedly refused to renounce-the Catholi faith, hasbyno means renounced the throne of Greece, provided he can retain the faith in which he has been brought up; he has this further advantage over his brother, that he has already several children who might succeed hima on the throne, while his brother, Prince Adalbert, is still unmarried, and,- fromn what careful observers relate of his future consort, his mariage with the Spanish Infanta and admission to the Greek throne:would only protract and not settle the existing difficulties as to the succession. The French policy in Greece is to consolidate the present overwhelming French influence there by setting a Catholic dynasty in its interest on the throne, and thus excludig the remains of the Russian interest, which was based on the Bavarian sympathies in its favour. The Catholic religioni has for alongtimnebeen in use as a means of turning even the Greek church to account in the East through the medium of the sect called United Greeks. Moreover, while France is absorbing- sll the commercial interests of Greece she is rapidly acquiring the upper hand along the whole seaboard of Turkey; England, in the meantime, isplaying a very subordinate part in the. latter empire, which, to judge by our actions, we regard with interest solely on account of its being the high road to our own possessions in India. Lord Granville is expected here to-morrow ;- Sir John Acten is here already as his precursor. *M. de Morny left here yesterday evening for' St. Petersburg, whither he is proceeding by land; his orininal intenton of staying here several days has been changed in consequence of finding that no members of the circles he desired to see here wero' now in town. As an instance of the splendour with which Prince Esterhazy intends to exhibit himself in Moscow, it may be mentioned that each of the six saddle horses that are reserved for his private use represents a value of from 8,000 to 10,000 gulden. The housings of the Prineo's own special charger are described as consisting of a splendid tiger skin edged throulghout with diamonds, wYith the coat of arms of the Prince embroidered also in diamonds. It is affirmed that the jewels and precious stones in the possession of Prince Esterhazy represent a higher value than all the estates and domains of the family put together. If this be true, the present dazzling display will not be so iucredible. ALl the members of the diplomatic corps of Russia seem just now to be absent from their posts; in most of the smaller States of Germany where Russian missions exist the cluanceleris are quite closed, and the business, if any such-the visg of passports-is referred to their Embassy in this capital, and this state of things is likely to last until September, when, the coronation being over, the whole diplomatic service will resume its wonted activity. There is hardly any mission in Berlin just' now that is represented by more than one attchg. The BMnisters are for the most part absent, and the official representative of most of the States of Europe has to be looked for in some humble retreat, consisting of furnished apartments up two or three pairs of stairs. The Emperor of Russia has aeceded to the recommendation of the Minister of Finance to reduce the import duty upon sugar. For the space of six years, starting from the 1st (13th) of Angust of this year, the duty on all sorts of raw sugar imported by way of sea is to be reduced to three roubles per poud. The Excise duty on beetroot sugar is, however, to remain unaltered during that same period. This reduction of duty is to be extended to all parcels of sugar imported since the opening of the navigation this year, but of which the duty shall not have been paid till after Augast 1. Those Custom-houses which formerly were only permitted to clear raw sugar are henceforth to admit refined sugar in loaves at a duty of five roieles silver per poud; this regulation to commence from August -1. The cause of this step being just now taken in the right way, without waiting for the general revision of the tariff that is to be published this aitumn, may perhaps be found in the results of a comparison between the imports of the first six months of 1855-the blockade year-and the first sx months of 1856-the peace vear. During the latter term there were 40,000 poud; imported less than during the former; of coffee, there was also a diminution of 20,000 pouds during the same period; it would seem as if our merchants at she commencement of this year had had sufficient conidence in the rstoration of peace to ihduce them to break off their dealings with'Russia over the Prussian frontier, but not sufficient to induce them to resume their imports by the way of St. Petersburg. Advices from St. Petersburg of the 24th inst. mention what will doubtless cause some considerable surprise--that the Emperor has commanded that the clergy of all the different confessions in the empire, not even excluding the non-Christians, Shall be invited offlcially to the coronation. The Emneror is representhd as having emphatically de-lsied that difference of relioion must not be perMnltted to form the ground of any difference of treatment and recognition to which all his subjects, without any exceptions, had aoquired a title. There wi, accordingly, be specis provision made for the representatives of all the different confessions and secta in Russia, who wi have a place asm'gned them in the procession to the Kemlin, as well as seata within the building. Agreat sensation was produced here yesterday by, the confiscation of that day's number of the Vossischie ZeUung in consequence of a cript issued direct from the Miniswry of the Interior. As this took place at half-past 9 o'clock n.m., it remains Almost without remlt, the whole edition having already passed into private hands; only the fewr numbers lying out at pLae of public resort thus fell into the hands of hie police. According to an explanation issued by the editorto-rdy, this severe measure, .so0.seldom. visited upon the most swidely-difused and influentihd journal of this place,, may be attributed to a leading article. regecting on the conduct of: Russia in destroying the fbrtitica,tions of Reni, and Ismait, -in. comnexion with the remarks lately. made,by Lord Clarendon -on this subject.

Sir- James Hudson, the English . Ninister at this Court, happened to be at' Spezzia at the timb, and I nderstand 'he speaks in ermis of the highest praise of the promptitude wit,h which the Sardinian authoritie3 acted. . The. instant they received notice'of the attempted outbreak every available man was despatched in support of the frontier posts vwithout- a moment of unnecessary delay, and it is.very much owing to this alaority that no resistance was made bytkn persons whom the Gendarmnes arrested afterwards with arms in their hands. The troops have now returnedto their quarters, with the exception of one eompany of Bersaglieri, which remains on the frontier near Ortonovo. The Sardinian Governmtut has received information from Massa and Carrara that tranquillity is perfectly re-establishei in the Modenese territory. * I lgear from Parma that' Count Crenneville was about to leave, for a time st least. BEi3 friends there said he was only going on leave to some watering-place, but, ,as the .-torriere ltalia?w and other German papers have already reported his approaching promotion and removal from his present command, it is very possible that his departure will be final-" for good," as they say-and that he has only been lbft so long in order not to give his removal the appearance of a recall on the demand of the Duchess.
GEBNRAL WINDHAM AT NOR WIGI. (F1OM OUF OWN i]tPORTER.) o NORWICH, SATURDtY. The roception of Major-GeneralVIndham in this city, of which I forwarded a brief notice yesterday, was of tre most enthusiastic description. Business was almost entirely suspended throughout the day, and the whole popilation of the city thronged 'he streets through which the procession was topass, to give n cordial welcome to the hero of the Redan. The most imposing feature of the cortegc was a body of 600 or 700 well-mounted tenant farmers, in some instanced accompanied by their landlords, who arrived in the course of the morning from all parts of thecounty, toform avoluntsry escort to the gallant officer who has so well sustained the honour of his county and of his name. On arrivingat the Guildhall, General Windham was con. ducted by the mayor (Mr. J. G. Johnson) to the old Council Chamber, where Lord Staiford, Lord Bury, many members of the corporation, and other gentlemen, including several Crimean officers, were in waiting to receive him. The gallant officer was greeted with reiterated cheers. The MsYOR, in presenting to General Windham the ad. dress from the Corporation of Norwich which appears in TVe Time-s of to-day (Saturday,) observed that it had beenunanimously agreed upon by-the Town-CounCil rearosenting the citizens. He (thoe b7yor) would make bold to say that no Englishman ever r-eceived. a more hearty and cordial welcome than that which he now offered to General - indham in the name of 70,000 citizens and inhabitants of Norwich. He would not attempt to recount the noble deed5 of General Wimdham, they would bo recorded in history (cheers); but he fervently prayed that that great God who had preserved the gallant officer unscathed in the midst of so many dangers would watch over him through every period of Hife, and bless him in every position in which he might be placed. (Hear.) General Windham would receive the rewards of a grateful country and sensible Government, and a Queen worthy of any people (cheers) ; and he trasted that he might long live to enjoy all the hap. piness which could be realized through the medium of a virtuous family. (Loud cheers.) The mayor then proceeded to read the address, which he handed to General Windham, amid a heArty burst of cheering. General WiN D AM said in reply,-As I shall probably have the honour of addressing a great number of those whom I see here after dinner this afternoon, and as this is the third occasion on which I have addreased public audiences since my arrival in Englana, I trust you will excuse my entering at any length into the topics alluded to in youraddress, forwhichI beg leave to thank yeu most sincerely and honestly. I have experienced in this county a more cordial reception even than elsewhere, although that was far beyond my merits. Since.Ilandedin Englandlhavo met, from tha Queen downwards, with such a reception as many bad half hours in the Redan would have been well passed to secure. (Cheers.) Onepassagein your addres3 particularly strack me,-"As Englishmen, we degred to see our brave soldiers maintain their ancient renown." I hope there is no one here who thinks they have not done so. (Loud cheering.) If you had landed, as I did, at Varns, and had seen the sickness and depression under which our soldiers were suffering, you never would have sapposed that -followed as they were bycholeratothe Crimea-those men, who were scarcely able to walk, would have plucked up their spirits sufficiently to settle the irst good affair between the Russians and ourselves in a couple of hour.s. (Cheers.) No one who saw the Britsh army mount the heights of Alma could doubt that they were worthy descendants of their ancestors who fought at Cressy and P'oictiers. (Hear, heor.) If, however, you think that victory was too easily won, take the battle of Inkermann, where our position was reversed, and where we were the attacked instead of the attackers. There, instead of being more numerous than the enemy, as was the case at Alma, we were not inore than one-sixth of their number;* but there the old British spirit was manifested, and our men resolutely ressted the enemy in a thick fog from the dawn of morning until late in the afteznoon. (Cheers.} Look too at wha the troops had to go through. ln the middle of tho winternd I see many officers here who can donfinr what I say-we had not more than 12,000 bayonets to do duty which rould properly have required-3e,00D. Why gentlemen, you meiht as well try in Norfolk to farm 1,000acres with capital for 300. (" Hear," and laughter.) Throughout the whole of the wintor, however, notwithstanding the hardship3 to which thev were exposed, the men discharged their duties without grumbhng, and with a cheerful reaiess which has Justly elicited the admiration of the country. (Cheers,) With regard to the attack on the Redan, in connexionwith which you have been pleased to speak so kindIy of me, I may say that I believe, m a military point of view, no one doubted that the distanco was too great; but Sir James Simpson had no pgotwer to alter the arrangements when it was decided that the French should attbck the Malakhoff, and variOus points of the town. We had, then, nothing to do but to attack the Redan. It was attacked with god spirit (cheers), butS from an immense distance. we hedd it for an* hour, hut we were ultimately repulsed. Surely, if we lost any prearge by having attckeod the Redan, and not having carried it, we- should have lost infinitely more if we had been cowards enough not to make the attack at all. ("Hear," and cheers.) We cannot blame our Commander-in.Chief for havigsaid, "Although we are not ready, and in proper postion to attack the Redan at the di-stance of 289 yar it shal never be said that the English army stood by with folded arms and allowed the French to take Sebsopoln (Loud -hoers) If we have lo-t 1n-rsagc as it is, wo should have lesS infinitely more if we had not made the attack- an.d, although I don't pretend to be theheroyouwonldm,ke me, I would rather have beenbusiedintbeditehof theo IRedan with the Second Division and the Light Division abovme, than that the British armyshould not have borne its fair share inthe assault onthat occasion. (Loudcheers.) I assure you, gentlemen, that I really feel overpowerd by the kidndessof the reception which hasbeenaccordedto me. Mfy feelings on returning to Norfolk are far different from I what they have been elsewhere ; for all that Imndtlovodi and admired in youth has been buried within tbe prcinct of the county, and I feel far more deeply the cordility with which my return here has been greeted than even the kind. news waw I lhare experienced in other parts of thbcountry. (Ltoud cheers.)I y Refreshments were provided in the Council-chamber by the Mayor, a nd after"* ' The heulth of the- Queen," followe by that of "General Windham, halud been drunk, the gallant officer was5 escorted by the -proc ession vrhich had attended him from the station to the residenceocf his friend, Mr. A.

(Loud cheers.) It is not merely to do honour to my gallant friend that we are met. We are met to celebrate an event that is essentially Norfolk. (Cheers.) The attack on the Redan wa one of those brief episodes in the history of the Crimean war that cannot well and properlybe celebrated except in the county ofNorfolk. (Uheers.) IT6 one can accuse me, an officer of 42 years' standing, os a wish to detract from the mierit of any officer inthe Queen's service; but this eveint of the Redan is peculiaryo rown. (Londcheesr.) Thepre stoldyonat t time wo bore prominent part in that conflict; indthe Commander-in-Chief selected 'the name of Vindham as the officerwbrthy of special notice in bis despatches. That notioe was responded to by the solc promotion for the deeds of the Redan. (Loul cheers.) A young officer, 200 below me 'on the list, was 3hade a major-general over my head. (Cheers and laughter.) My gallant friend was promoted to the command of a division, and immediately afterwards to the most responsible sitwltion of chief of the staff-an office. to which civilians may not be disposed to attach its full importance. It is one which involves the most; important dities and the most awful responsibility. To the chief of the staff is consigned All the important duties of equipping and of feeding an army and let me tel you, gentlemen, to illustrate the compliment which T consider was paid to our gallant guest's abilitiesbybding selected for this duty, the reply of the great DzIe of ellington to a question put to him by an indiscreet young officer, as to who would be placed in his stead were he to be Illd ? The Duke named an officer, and remarked that he was the best man, becausehe knew hoemto feed an army. We have had the Crimean army return from a country, not fatmus for its provislons-not like the field where I once servedBelgium-where everything came to your hands; and in what state did that army zeturn? In the finest and best state in every respect. (Cheers.) It was the best eq-upped army, and indeed, the bes. army in every respect, ch this country has been able to boast. (Cheers.) I don't wish to claim for my gallant friend more honour than is due, but will any man tell me that the army could have been in the magnificent state in which it has returned unless the chief of the staff had done its duty.. (Loud cheers.) I have now another duty toperform to my gallant friend. I have discharged my duty as a soldier, and now appea in the character of a country gentleman; and in that capacity it falls to my lot, as occupant of-the chair, to present to my gallant friend tliese tokens of the admirations the inhabitants of his nativo county entertain of hs gallantrv. I;Lord Albemarle here exhibited two swords wlhich had 'ben purchased by subscriptioi for presentatiorn to' "General Windham. One was a very hanudsome dress sword, in a crinmson velvet sheath, elegantly embossed; while the other was a servico sword, in the ordinary steel scabbard.1 The duty now devolves upon mae (continued Lord Albemarle of presenting to our gallant gnest the testimonial which has been subscribed for in the two articles I hold bef6re me. My gallant friend is not a coxcomb in anything, except it bo in his weapons; and I recoUect that previous to the purchase of the sword, on his beiag consulted, the only condi. tion he made was that the hilt sLould be weeU fitted to the hand, so that he could strike a go6d stroke with it. (Loud cheers.) Here (said the noble lord, exhibiting the weapon for service) is my gallant friend's fighting sword, and here (holding up the dress sword)ishisholyday sword. (Loud cheering.) With all my admiration of my gallant friend, and my wish for his advancement in the service, I do hoe for the progress of civilization, for the prosLerity of this country, and for the cause of humanity, that this sword (ths fighting one) may never be unsheathed. (Hear, hear.) But if Providence should order otherwise, and if the Queen should require the services of hier soldiers again, sure I am that this sword wil never be drawn in vain (cheers); but that it wil add fresh laurels to the wreath which already encircles his brow, and give us fresh cause of pride at having him for our countryman. (Cheers.) Lord Albemarle, amid loud and prolonged applause, handed the swords to General 'Windham, and then proposed the health of the gallant officer, which was received with reiterated bursts of cheering. General WINDAmr, who rras greeted with the most enthusiastic cheering, said.-Ladies and gentlemen,-I am proud to say that I was bora in the county of Norfolk ; many of the happiest days of my life have been passedin Norwich; and now I have the honour of receiving here the great crowning compliment of my manhood. (Cheers) I 5hall always keep and cherish the two sworcs you have this day presented to me, and when I am either too old to use them, or when I am dead and gone, I trust there will be found some descendant of my name who will gird them on his waist, and who will not disgrace that county which conferred them on his ancestor. (Lond and prolonged cheering.) I have received frem HerMajesty downwards the most extrordinary and cordial 'welcome that has, perhaps, been experienced' by any man who has arrived from the Crimea; but I tell youa honestly that the warmest welcome has been reserved for me in this my native county. (Loud cheers.) I assure you it has hai the greatest effect upon me, because when I came into this old county 'where many of those whom I loved moct lie buried, I felt more overpowrered by the warm reception with which I was greeted tha,n by that with which I was met by comparative strangers. (Cheers.) I am well aware it would be extremely absamrd to suppose that, at my timo of life, those who surrounded my cradle should now stand by my side; but on casting my eyes round this' table I am'happy to see many faces that I well rcmembar when I was a bcy. I have on my left Lord Albemarle who knew me in my boyhood. I see near me Lord Hastings, who has known me from my childhood; and I regret that indisposition has prevented my oldest, my best, and my dearest friend-the friend of my father too-fr6m being present on this occasion. It may perhaps be somewhat imbeconiing that,at a public meeting of this naturo, I should give expression to myfesaings of private andpersonal regard, I am aware that heroes are supposed to poeses hearts of adamaut, but as I don't set myself up as a grezs hero, I hope I may be allowed to have a little feeiing. (Cheers and laughter.) Basider, Norfolk men have always been famous for their attachnsent to their homesteads. I well remember one old man at Felbrigg who lived -to be npwards of 90, and who was only beyond tae hundred of Z''orth Erpingham three times in his lifetwice to come to Norwich, and on ce to go to Iynn (hughter), and when ho arrived at Lynn he was so rear the confines of the county that he at orce became ill. (Renewed laughter.) I well rememberthe first attack on the Rodan on the 18h of June, 1555. Iwaz j ot employed in that attaek. I was merely in reserre'and I in.' curred no more danger than any of my friends Whom 1 see around mUe. I happened to be sent by Sir L .Bentinckto find out what was going on, whenl saw a man two ortAhree yards a-heid of me walking alonig the trench. Aroundlshot flew over the rapet, and .lmost hid him in dust. I thought he was killed; but when the dust subdued I saw anindividuAl whose countenanc) presented a curious admix. tore of fright d joy. Scratching his head, he said tome, "'Why, dashny buttons, but thatwsmost amasn nigh. (Laughter.) The moment he opened his mouth I knew' froml what county he caine (a. laugh) andRIaid,2 "Aye, aye, my boy, we'd much better be diggig trenches at i a rod in Norfolk than fightiug here." (RenewedLaughter.) He was astonished that I had hit; upon his native o and his only reply wa "Wht are yetaw Ls from Norfolk?' (Laughter and cheer) But, gentlemer, let us dopjuti eto our own county.

(General Fwinadhm here turned round, and, amid loud cheering, pointed to ehe portrit of Lord NRelson, wahich hung inasediatey Iseland his chair.)

THE BELGIANFE7ES; BBJUSSELS, AUG. 2. Lord Westmorland left Brussels yesterday, after a most satisfactory mission. The relationship and friendship existing between the Sovereigns of Belgium and Great Britain secured for him a hearty reception, the warmth of which hIs personal position and kina manners naturafly increased. The Enligsh public nll begladtoknowthat the representativo of their Sovereign was honourably received by the Sovereign and people of a truly constitutional State. The spoech delivered to the Eing by Lord Westmorland at his firs audience has been printed in the oniteur Belge, and. hlss created a very favourable impression. I send you the temct of it, which appeared in the originalas -well as in a Irench translation. The day of its publication was that on-wrhieh the King arrivel at' Brages, and the effect are apparent when I tell you that at both the dinners given to the King at that place " God save The Queen" was played and received with the greatest enthusiasm. The following is Lord Westmorland's-address "Sire,-Iam commanded by-the Queen, my august mistrees, to present to your 'Majesty her congratulations apon the happy return of the 25th anniversary of your accession to the throne of the independent kingdom which has flourished under your able and successful government. "The tender attachment of the Queen to her beloved uncle and the high estimation in which your Majesty ha ever been held in England since your early connesion with my country must increase and enhance the admiration and satisfaction with which Her Britannic Majety and her subjects vew the results of vour Majesty's wise and benoflont course in the prosperity and independence of your kingdom, the contentment of your people, and the attachmenet unli-ersally shown to your person. - - "These blessings are justly diue to the monah wvho has, inperilous times, conducted in safety the country which, Uner a constitution securing freedom without liceneo and the well-regulated lhhert of aIl classes, is a pattern of good government, order, and loyalty. In charging me to convey to your Majesty these sentimerts in the name of the queen, Her Majesty has oonferred upon me not only a high honour, bxt a taskthe mnost gratify*ng to my personal feelings from the devoted and respectful attachment which I have, for a very great portion of mv life, entertained for your Majesty, aud which las caused me ever to folow with pride and happiness the steps of your Majesty's nol-le career. "May your Majesty long continue in -the erjoyment or heaIthto reap the fruits of your successful exertions in this favoured country." The fitcs aro by no means orer.

The report was then unanimously adopted. On the motion of the CiAU'rLuAs, suconded by MIr. L. SISrIPso, the directors were authorized to borrow any sumn' or eums not exceeding in the whole 25,0Q00. Resolutions were passed confirming the forfeiture of 447' sbarei and appointing Mr. C. Christian an auditor of ithe company. In reply to questions, il was stated that a large number of shares had been taken up hy one gentleman, who was unable to pay the calls, and that had caused a deficiency of about 20,0001. in the-ehare capital which would have to be made up. There was no doubt that the works would be completed within the original estimate; bat that in conseqhencc of the stations at Beckenham and Lesisham not beinc'iacluded in the original estimate the specified amount of S6,OOW. wouild he exceeded.

Baker in the chair. The report referred to the statement of accounts, which showed a balance applicable to dividend of a sum equal to 1s 3d. per share, free of income-tax, with a balance in hand of ll51. This showed an improvement of 3d. per share, last hadf-years dividend having been 12s. per share. Taldkg into"calculation the deduction for income-tax, this dividead was eqal to B5 per cent. per annum. The directors held the ha-yearly meeting on the earliest practicable day, in order that the shareholders might have the benefit of the di..iaend at the earliest moment. The CI.RAasLiN having briefly noticed the contents of the report, a short discussion took place, and in reply to 4uestions put hy a proprietor, The Secretary (Xr; Nash) said, there was no, preseat pr6spect of an increased dividend on account of the Hereford,Ross, and Glocester line (which company runs over th whole of the Glocester and Dean Fores' line between Glecester and tLe Grunge). The traffic of the Heref6nl, Ross, and GlocIster line was very good, but the capital had been incrased beyond-what it had been anticipated wouid be'required."- PMr.rPPrcx, M.P., stated, with reference to the expected competition between Hereford and London, by the construction of the Worcester and Hereford Railwav, that he did not anticipate the 'Vorcesterand Hereford line when opened wodad materially injure the traffic of the Hereford, Roes, and- Glocester, and Glocester and Dean Forest line. The lines would be to a certain extent competing lines-aB between Hereford and London-but the torcester route woould be abont 10 miles longer than the Glocester route to London, the Worcester route being on the narrow gauge, -i;l London and North Western line, and the Glocester on the, broad gauge.

'How ~en to nb _1-h rport of the Chelsea Commissioners is a Insnuol or guide-book to the scienc of t e in c ce fow not to doit." Let itbe reissued by some enterprising -oubli,her as The Oficer-hzis Dutis, and hose not to do thess. The directions are perfect. We had an army providedas far as appearances went, with every requisite for success and subsistonce. It had, besides the generals who were to letd itto victory, a host of other generals to tako care of it -adjutant-generals, qeartermaster-generals, commissarygeneraLs, with actsng-assistant sub-deputies, and other subordinates with half, the letters of the alphabet stuck after their names, to find it with stores, to clothe and pr ovision it. What more was wanting? Nothing. There were the executive officers, and there the troops requiring the stores, clothing and food. The only thing that remained was ingeniously to discover the way ' not to give them." That -was soon devised, and the Chelsea Commissioners have approved the device as in full accordance viith the rales of the service. The adjatant-general did not properly c65tle this army, the quarteniscter-general did not supply it-with suitable stores, and the commis-ar--general did not' sufficiently feed it; but each and afl caLled' upon somebody eEe to do something else, and the somebody in his turn shifted the responsibility, and the something was not done aftez- al. Nevertheless, the adjutant, quartermaster, and commisaaxY*general are admirable officers notwithstanding an;dmust not be blamed. The old woman in the nursery rhyme whose return home from market was delayed by the refusal of herpig toget over the style called upon the animal addvegetable kingdoms, and the elements to boot, to help her, just as the staff in the Crimea caUed upon heaven and earth to help them. The water would not uench the fire, and the frab would net bunm the stick, and the stick would not beat tha pg, and so on. - In like manner Airey could not- help wherzl,and-Vetherall could hot help Gordon, andGordbncould not helpFilder, and Eilder could not help himself. So they all came to a deadlock, till private charity stepped in to give them breathing time to recover from the panie theirownincapacity hd brought upon them. A quarternastar general is, we suppose, the only official extant who receives without examination materials upon the fitness or dimbility of which thousands of human lives under his charge may- depend. .According to the principles of "how not to- do- it:," he has merely to make requisitions. If. he asks for bread and receives a stone, or rice vend, that is ndthing to him. He may gravely serve out Mlacademi for rabdon;, and supply biscuit for making roads, and to him no- blame can -possibly attach. And so wvith eveiybody iipugned. Considering how admirably, indeed, the com-- mLsAinemt throughout - their repdrt tustain the rad principle of "how not to do it,"' we&must reallythink it-natatcr of some marvel that they should ever have LsOn--brouOht to make their report at all.

The facts, so far as they can be stated, shortly were, that 3Ir. Mint, being a director, and wishing, with other directors, to Ietire, made an agreement to relinquish his and their shares, rights, and interests in the association to the association, and in consideration thereof the remaining directors released him and them from all liability, and the shares were accordinly transferred to the association, the transfers duly registered, and the prospectuses of the association altered by the omiss.on of the names of Mr. MAunt and the retiring directors. They were, however, placed upon the list, .and the Master of the Rolls refused to remove them. hlr. Munt and his co-directors so rethina, considering this a hardship, for in effect it would be to sold that " once a director alwa director," appealed. Counsel contended that the appellnt had done all in his power to apprise the public of the change; that everything had been fair and noni ted4 and that therefore the decision of his Honour the Master of the Rolls could not stand.

The Cleopatra left vealta with troops, having- the sailing-transport Talatua f70tons hardlen, in tow, bounid to-Constantinople. Thea eaher was fine and calm. The Simla alleged Wthat she descried the Cleopatra distant about two miles, wlereIpon she ported her helm, and afterwards put it hard a- port and stopped her ellies. The Cleopatra continued to approach her rapidly, and o n coming -within hailin- distance 'ith her helm hard a-starboard she was londly hailed to port it, which she did at the last moment. The engines of the Simla were then turned a-head, in order that the Cleopatra, if she had answered her helm quickly, might have gone astern of the Simla; but the helm of the Cleopatra was shifted too late to make any sufficientalterationinher course, ind sho almost immediately ran stem on into the Simla, and I did her considerable damage. She attributed the collision to the Cleopatra on first coming in sight of the Snnla starboaraing instead of porting her helm. The Cleopatra pleadcd that she discovered the Simla distant from tbree.tofomumilesbearing aboutthreepointson her starboard bow, whereupon she first starboarded herhelm, and aftervwards put it hard astarboard for the -purpose of making the courses of the two vessels further diverse. The Sitnla aptroaching at the rate of nine knots an hour neared the Cleopatra's starboard bow in a direction to pass well clear cf her, and then suddenly, when too late, ported her helm and attempted to pass ahead of the: Cleopatra, thereby renhermg acollisfortinevitable.

SUMMER ASSIZES. SO0ME CjiRCUI. CBELMSFORD, AuOusT 2. (Before Aizr. JuStiCe BRLE cind a Special Jury.)' rLISTE -ANnD ANOTER V. LEATHER AS)D ANOTHER. This cause was further proceeded with to-day. Sir F. Thesiger (who came down on a special retainer), Mtr- Bovill, Q.C., Mr. Lush, and Mr. Webster were counsel for tbeolaintiffs; tha Attorney-General (also specially retained),7 Mr. Chambers, Q.C., Mr. Hindmarsb, and Mr.' Lloyd appe.red for the defendants. 1 It has been already stated that this action was broaght a'ainst the defendants for the alleged infringement of two patents obtained by the plaintiffs in 1850 and 1852 for imn proved woolcombing machinery. The plaintiffs carry on a veryextensive business as woolcombers at Bradford and Leeds, and the defendants are engaged in the same business at Bradford. Although it is said that a vast amount of pecaniary interest is involved in the inquiry, the case is mostly of importance to the parties concerned, the object of the plaintiih being to secure the use of the invention, which, it appears, effects a vast saving of manual labour, to themsalves, and it appears that they are receiving from many firms in Yorkshire so much as 3,0001. a-year for license to use the machinery in question. In consequence of the numbex of models that were exhibited in the-course of the case it was found impracticablo 't try the ciuse in the Nisi Prius Court, and the County Assembly-room was therefore appropriated to the purpose. A great number of Professional men were called as witnesses for the laintiff, and, aording to the testimony given by themo the niachinery made use of by the defendants was an infringement upon the plaintiff? patent, and any deviations that appeared in it were merely of a colourable nature. It also appeared that in 1846 the plaintiffs purchased the interest of a person named Heilianan in some Woolcombing machinery which he had, invented for asum of 30,0001., and themachinery now inquestion was said to hl-ve made great improvements upon that which was so pta-chased. 'The case for the defendants was-firstly, that the mac'uinery of the plaintiffs was merely a combination of several ijventions that had existed long before, and that it was bot entitled to protection on the ground of novelty; and they also said that the machinery made use of by themnwas of an original character, and was not a copy of the plaintiff's, at, in point of fact, differed frn it in many essential particulars.- A great number of witnesses were exammned with a view to make outthose facts, and at hall-past 4' o'clock the trial was ag,ain adjourned to Monday mornng, at 10 o'clock.

The calendar contains the names of only 10 prisoners. Of these 1 was charged w;.ith administering poison with intent to murder, 1 with rape, 2 with bigamy, 2 with cutting and wouniding, 2 with conspiracy to defraud, and the rest with ordinary larcen ies.

She used oxalic acid in her business for the purpose of stiffening the straw bonnets, and had some in a closet in her house. On the I 16th of April last she had been drining, and was the worse for liquor, and had a quarrel with her daughter, whom she beat and threw water upon. She then went to the closet, and, mixing something in a mug, took it to er aughter and told her to drink it. The girl took some, but it bu,nt her throat, and she refused to take any more, and pushed the pot from her, her mother insisting upon her arinking it, in the contest the contents were spilt over the girl's dress and took the colour out. The prosecutrix then became very sick anid ill, and went into the house of a neighbour named Dalton, to whom she toldwhat her mnother had done to her, and Miss Dalton sent for Mr. Broadbent, the doctor, and also for the girl's mother. The prisoner, on being accused of giving poison to her daughter, denied it, and said what she had taken she had tanken hercelf. The prisoner then left the house. and paid i*o more attention to her daughter, who remained at Miss Dalton's two davs very ill, attended by the doctor. M1r. Broadbent, on hearing thu girl's acco-unt of what had been done to her, gave her antidotes for the poison of oxalic, acid, and the girl gradually recovered. On testing what she had vomited ihe found the presence of oxalic acid, which was an irritant poison. Both the prosecutrix aud Mliss Dalton appeared unwilling witnesses, and the prosecutrix cried much, and suggested that she thought her mother intended to give her some Epso salts. IThe earned counsel for the defence urged that it was probable the prisoner had niade a mnistake between the oxalic acid and Epsom salts, seeing that, she had been drinking, as ir was not to be supposed that without motive she could be guilty of the shocking crime, of- attempting to poison her own daughter. His LoP.DSHIP having carefully summed up the evidence, suggesting the possibility of a mistake between the poison and salts, The jury consulted together for some time, when one of the jury wished to ask the prosecutrin if salts were kept in .the c-a b .-d ther. ou DDET, objected to the question being put) the case "being closed; and the jury then retired. }His Loraipss, in-their absence, then- called up the girl, and-put the question ; and she rephed that-salts were kept in the cupboard.. is Lordship then sentfor the jury, and told them he thought it right to inform-them of this answer of the prosecutrix. The jury, after a short furthe-r convitawion, AcqniUed Onthe trials for bigamy, which wereof the ordinary character of those tried at these assizes;-nassely, marriages over the border, proved by the tollgate keepers of Gretna. who p^rform the ceremony, hisLordship, after passing light sehtences because of the circunistances of the oases,- announced tbat, as in fature these.

Prom whatever cause wising, there. seems to be a Trowing impreion that the fugitive member for Tipper-.ry is, or has been of Lite, in the nseighbourhood -of his old haunts. Letters from Carrick-onSuir state that in the course of la5t week the police wenr engaged in active search about Coohsamuck Court, one of the may properties purchased by John Sadleir in the Encumxbered Estates Court. 'he game did not turn up, but circumstances were elicited which led the constabulary to the conclusion -most probably an erroneous one-that the delin-qaent had been there very recently. 3M.. GIVASN DUFSY flz T COI,o.Nsqs. The fiNation-speaking, no doubt, by book-is constained to confess that Er. Gavan Duffy has II broke with some of the foremost men in Sydney rather than permit the Governor (Sir WVillian Deiison) to be honoured as a toast at his (YMr. DuflWs) banquet." Mr. Duflf's candid, but illtimed declaration, upon the same occasion, that hei was " still a rebel to the backbone," has also severely injured his prospeet of speedy political advancement in the colony. Private letters say 'that the promised subtcriution which was raising in his beha'f hadgreatly disappointed the expectations of his admirers-in tact, that it would fall short by o0 per cent, of the amounlt anticipated on his first arrivl in Sydney, end before the delivery of his dinner speech. CONSERVATIE 'PBw08PECr, The County of Dowfn Protestant Association have just issued their second annual report, the tone of which is, upon the whole, rather dispiriting as regards its -present state and prospects. :For instance: "The treason of the leaders of the Derbyite party to the Protetnt cause, and the uselessness of expecting any Protestant political action from them, and fromn the present G overrnment, shows the necessity exiating mcore pressingly than ever of Protestants placdng their entire dependence on the Lord of HIosts wvho from apparent weanlnss of ten brings out victory. The state of the peolitical wvorld abroad as such .s to lead us to believe that Rome is preparing to make a deadly struggle to obtain everywhere com'Plete ascendancy. Under such circunmstsances, it is our dat7 to protest against every entanglement of the British nation in the web of the Papacy, and to claim for our fellow Protestants all the world over freedom to Worshi God. We desire that all our eforts should be1begunan continued in an humble and prayerful dependence on the -Zaptain of the od' Host.. Recognizing in Rome the doomed apostacy, we hold it a privilege to be enabled in any meafure to share in the great battle, and rejoice to be found on the side w-th the faithful and true in Rome's war with the Lamb. We call on all Protestants to come forward to share our privilege, and earnestly to contend for the faith once delivered to the saints against Babylon the great." TH HAlRVESTr The Cork-mxamin-er of yesterday states that the crops throughout that extensive district are advancIng towards maturity with a rapidity abnost unprecedented, and that a few weeks' continu ance of the present fine weather would see the farmer commencino his harvest operations - "A gentleman who is directly connected with the agriculnrs2 interest, and has an irtimate acquaintance with a vast portion of this and the adjoining county of Kerry, has informed us that, since Saturday last, the crops have progressed towards maturity at a rate that he believed vul4 under ordinary circumstances, reqe three weeks to accomplish. The corn croPs of every description contilnuwe to present the mclost healthy and, luxuriant appearance, nrm in stalk and full in ear- belt in some few instances we have heard of the partial appearance of blight among ths potatoes. In the neighbourhood of Xiaaale, and in Eome parts of the contiguous coast, it is stated to have made Its appear-ncne hut even in those o-ses the ground is expected to yield more than an average crop, owing to the abundance of the produce and the comgastively small extent to which the blight has appeared. urreports from the eastern part of the county, from pFrmoy, iore, Mallow, Kanturk, and the intermediate districts represent the plant as vigorous and healthy, free from a'ny appearance of disease, and promising at early and ab-undant supply. With the singular uncertainty that marks tho-progress of this mysterious disease, we understand that the potatoes at present grown on the Little Island, in the neighbourhood of this city, are perfectly free from disease, t.hou. h in formeryears they were the first that were attacked and among those that suffiered most severely. It may be reasonably anticipated that even a brief continuance of the present weatherwill pprove an efficient agent in arresting the progress of the disease, in the isolated localities in whicit haa appeared, by stimulating the plant into an early and vigorous maturity, that may defy the efforts of its adogus enemy."

LATE NAV,L REnvIW AT SPRsAM.-On Saturs day, in the Southwark County Court, an action %as brought by a gentleman named Horsey, against the South Eastern Railway Company, to recover the sum of eight guineas and 15s. from the defendants, they having committed a. breach of contract in neglecting to convey him and his friends to sce the naval review at Spithead. Mr. Robinson appeared for the plaintif and rL-. Poland for the railway company. The plointiff said that in the month of May last he saw advertisements in the newspapers offering to take passengers by rail and boat to witness the great naval reniew at Spithead. They were headed London and South-Eastern Railway, and signed " Eboralle, nianager." In consequence of that he went to the railway office, 147, Cheapside, and purcbased four tickets, fo- which he paid eight guineas. The tickets were like the one produced, which defendants admiatted to be a copy. Vhen they arrived on board the vessel they were known and ,recognized. He purchased them on. the 21st, having seen the advertisement on the Saturday previous When they got, to Portnmouth theirboat was lo and they were put on board the Princess Helena. She wsfitted up forthocac.Ter were four or five deal tables. The hold was lined vwith bunting, and about 12 mattresses were thrown down for them to sleep on; about one to three persons. Tallow candles hunby ropes, and there was not the least accommodation' While at PGotsmouth he asked leave to gon shore, when the capti said he did net know how long hle sihould ho there, but he allowedl thetm to go ashore, to return by 10 o'cloc.:, which they did. The review was to begin at 11 o'cock Aler he got bac'k to the vessel the dietos steamerpa,ssed with anxother boat, and they foll.owed the Q tueenahont till 12 o'clock. Witness asked to be allowed to-go on board the directors' boat, and hailed it, but they would not stop. They were left behind the last steamer and did not qu't Portsmouth harbiour until 21 o'clock. The captain told them he was advised to wait fot another train from London, and that was the reason he did not leave the harbour. The interesting part of the review was over when they got there. In the iaorning a placard was posted on the deck. It announced that, by ayig 1os., they might return by the Brighton Railway. RTha were not taken round the fleet, but of cotuse th saw some of the shi a comina into harbour. They no sofas-nothing but deal boards and forms. They followed the director? boat, and saw the gunboats in the attack, buttheydid not sea the Queen pass through the fleet M1r. Poland, on the part of the railway company, contended that they had performed their contract to the best of their ability, and the plaintiff had seen the review, although he did not see the Queen pass through the fret, and that he deemed quite sufficient for them. His Moncur said, assuming the delay of the steamer from the harbour to have been caused by some unavoidable accident, the companywould not have been liable, but it was pain that the vesselwas delayed forthe purpose of the company, from tieir not supplying two steamers, they supposing that one could dotbe work. The consequence was thit the seamer in question was delayed one hour, and that the most important h6nr of th-e day. The review meant the whole. reniew, or, at all events, the Queen's passage through the fleet, which tihe defendant and his friends did not see, therefore he must gi3Ve jadgmett forthe plaintiff, with costs. There were five ,ther actions of a similar nature against the railway eomray, in which the Judge also gave jadgment for the?nkin. tiZ considering that the defendants were gulDty ofgross mevilimneue. ?t&Y James Beeby is appointed Chief Clerk ; Mr. OUiver H.

7 I PENI.YSULAR M.AILS. I SO1THAMPTON, AIVG. 2. By the Peninsular and 0Oiental company's steamnship Maid, Captain Bradshaw, with the Peninsular mails, in cbaxge of Lieutenant Oxenham, RPN., Aniralty agent, wo have dates from Gibraltar, July 24; Caadiz, 25; Lisbon, 294 Oporto and Vigo, 30. The Madrid brings 40 passengers, and on freight 12 packages of specie, value 3,732g., and a cargo consisting of 2931roxes of lemons, 13b oxes of tom;atoes, 4 caslis e e, 90 elephants' tushs, and 27 packages of merchandise. On the 1st insh, in lat. 47.291N., long. 6 32 W., the Madrid passed the brig Muta, of Ipswich, steering S.W. The French ship Prince Jerome was the only foTeign yessel of war at Lisbon when the Mfadrid left. The steamer Italian amived on the 28th uL'. from Lverpool, with fire in the forehold. * The Lisbon exchanges were quoted, fX.three months', at 53Z on London; Paris, 524; Austerrdam, 434; Hamburg, 48 ; and Genoa, 522. The supply of bills still continued inadequate to the demand, consequent upnon the increased importations of grain, &c., and diminution of export, consequent Upon grape disease auad bad harvests of all kinds. Stocks continued to advance, and few holders would sell at 44* to 44i for Three per Cents.; Bank of PotAugal Shares, 490 to 495 mnilreis per share ex. dividend; Oporto Bank shae-s, 19 to 20 per cent. premium. The following is extracted from our Lisboii correspondent's letter of the 29th ult.:- "Immediately after elosing the Cortes the King, ing Rlegent, and. Royal family took up their abode at Cintra, which is justly considered the most delightful sunmmer residence m this neighbourhood. It is also comparatively healthy at this season of the year, and I am told by friends who came thence this morning that there is no truth in the reports which have led to the belief that cholera had been making great ravages there. "In Lisbon 414 cholera deaths are reported during the iast ten days, but I question whether ons-half were reajly cholera cases, and, from personal knowledge of the circumstances attendmsg the death of a numbtr or my own ae. quaintance I am convinced that all of them brought on the disease by inattention to diet, neglect of slight derangements of tho stomach, and by imprudent exposure to chill from draughts and cold baths. Mr. J. E. Borges doSouza, one of our most -espected Portuguese merchants, brought on his attack and sudden death by takiDng a cold bath while suffering from severe indigrstion. From all the isnormation I bave been able to collect it would appear that cholera has not here attacked houses which are regulated with prudence and immediate attention to complaints of the bowels, &c. "Since the approval of the arrangement for quoting Portuguese bands upon the London Stock-Exchange they have contiued to improve in price, and the Government finds additional facilities for its Treasury operations. At Oporto, also the Commercial Bank has agreed to lend the Minister of h?inance 200 eon'os, or about45,OOL, to be repaidby the Customs' revenue durig the year 1956-57. "The Government is busy prepainug the instructions for the electoral pzrecess, but has not yet given signs of any intention to take active measures in favour of any particular class of candidates. The Progresista partydone has appointed an electoral eommittee, composed of hL Fontes and other p artisans of the last and present Cabinets, and it is supposed the Government wvill nltimately favour many of the candidates p reposed by that committee, in which ease the new Chamber of Deputies 'will bear much the same character as the hast."' Our intelligence from Gibraltar is to the 24th nIt. The United States' steam-frigate Susquehanna arrived at that port on the 23d nit, in 16 days from Key WVest and sis from EayaL. This steamer 'was recently despatched from Phila. delphia to Central America to inquire into certain grievances alleged by the master of an Americans vessel to have been committed by Captain Tarleton, of Hter Britannic Majesty's frigate Eurydice, on the A merican mail steamer Orizab3. On proceeding to Greytown Commodore Paulding, of the Gulf Squadron, 'who was specially sent by the Secretary of the N~avy, became fully convinced that things had been misrepresented. The Commodore's fag was saluted by Captain Tarleton, and the k;indes feelings pre|vailed among the officers and men of both vessels. After exchanging the usual civilities the Susquehanna departed for Kiey West, whence, replenishing her stock of coal, she was ordered to proceedto the Mediterranean station, and is no'wundertbe orders of the Commander-in. Chief at Gibraltar. In a day or two the steam-frigate would leave for Spezzia (Sardinia), touching at seine of the ports on the eastern coast of Snain.
RAGGED OR RnroRrATouy SCosoLs.-Thoe Cormittee of Council on Education have cancelled all former minutes and agreed to grant substantial and permanent aid to reformatory and ragged schools. The unurite by which this resolution is made knovn to the rnanagers of these institutions provdes that no school shall be admissible to aid "- unless it be industrial in its character, and unless the scholars be taken exclusively from the criminal and abandoned classes." These conditions being complied with, the Council are-L To pay half of the rent. 2. To pay onethird of the annual cost of tools and of raw material for labour. 3. To make grants towards the cost of books, maps, and apparatus upon to samne terms as to other schools. 4. o pay 350h to the treasurers of any reformatory in respect of every person qualified to teach wvho shall have heen boarded, lodged~ and trained asa master for a year in the institution, and holding certificates of merit from HIer Majesty's inspectors of schools. 5. To grant haLf of the salary paid to the teacher, and half of his assistant's salary; no teacher to have more than 2a scholars for the master, and between 26 and 50 for each assistant. 6. " To grant as capitation on every child (according to the noumbr in average attendance diring the year preceding the annual inspection) who is not paid for by the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury under the act the 17th and 15th of Victoria, chap. S6, the sum of 50s. Per rannm, provided that such child be fed at the schooL' Reformatories and ragged schools coming within the operation of this act are to be under the special inspection of Her Majesty's inspetors of schools. The instructions to the inspectors are very minute. On the subject of appointing teachers, the minute of instructions says, "You will observe that the Government leaves the choice of teachers absolutely to the managers, interposing no test whatever except the inspectors' annaual reports upon certain specified points." The principal officer in each school must " in all cases be well enough instructed to be able to control and to be responsible for the work of the school-room." As regards the standard of education, it is provided that t'he literary ability of a teacher may be regarded as sufficient if the inspector is satisfied that the boys under his charge leamr to xead, write, and cipher in such a manner as to acquire the practical command of those arts in earninr their bread and making their way in the world. "g boy who reads with difficulty and without intelligence, who writes smperfectly and spells ill, who cannot readily a,ply the rules of arithmetic to a common transaction of the shop or of wages>" might, it is assumed, " as well, for most practical purposes, be unable to read, write, or cipher at allT and this test the inspectors are instructed rigorously to apply. "In the same way," says the minute, "as to religions knowledge, you should endeavour to ascertain that the doctrines and maims of Christianity are taught in such a manner as to be likely to become motives and rules of conductf' and, in respect of practical duties in the workshop, the inspectors are instructed to; see that the work of industrial schools is really properly done. "You are to bear in mind," says the Colmcil, " that nd oral delivery of moral lessons can be so effective as that which results from daily practice. You wil not, therefore, allow any general professions to weigh against the evidence which a school or workshop may present in itself of a want of order, obedience, anm cleanlness. A disobedient, dirty, illconditioned lad 'is not to be talked out of those habits,' but can only be cured by being obliged to live in daily and hourly contact with the p.uctical opposites of them." MURDER or Two r1nS-.--- double mnurder was committed on Saturday morning, about Jive miles from Dover, by a man namedl Sedea Redenies, a Neapolitan, in the 4-h company of the 2d battalion, 2d Regiment British Swiss Legion, uo6wstationed at Shorncliffe. Redenies, it appears, has for some timq been paying his addresses to a young girl of 1$, naimed Caroline Back On Saturday evening he called at the house of her parents, who are worldng people, residig i Albion-place, Dover, and stayedthereuntil S o'clock yesterday morning. The giri's sister, Maria Back, was present during the time. It appears that during the evenmg Redemies quarrelled with Caroline, nad accused her of carrying on a correspondence with a sergeant of the same regiment. He, however, prevailed upon her to consent to go with him to the casup to spend the day, accoman ied by her younger sisterMaria. The bodies of both the swere found yesterday-morning about 8 o'clock in ahollow close bya footpath leading to Folkstone. The elder sister had received fourstabsnear the heart and was quite dead. The youngergirl, Maria, appeared to have struggled hard with her assailant. Ssveral of her fingers were severely cut. The discovery was made by a farm servant who obtained medical assistance, but it was of no avaiL The supposed murderer was seen running through the viLage of Capel shortly after the occurrence. The Dover Police are in pursuit of him. According to the rather imperfect account which has reached us, the spot wtherehe bodies were foud is sitated about two miles from Folkestone, between the Beyal Oak publichouse and the Valiant Sailor publichouse at the top of Folkrtone-hild. *I-s-r OF' Wnn&cnA5 Oowmn .-.At a sale of nutogra hs, which took place at the auction rooms of Messrs.

AQUA TICS, A very exellent amateur pair-oared boatrace was rowed on Saturday evening, for a urize of the value of 10l The competitors were-C. Halei and J. Marriott (Times Unity Club), and W. WVhite (Queen's Printer's), and J. Perry (Messrs. Tyler's), and the distance rosed was from MIr. E. Godfrey's,the Queer's Head, Mortlake, down to Putneybridge. Haes and Marriott were the favourites, at G and 7 to 4, and in some instances 2 to L The Curledw steamer acconpanied the race with the frieods of the ties, and -was crowded with a respectable company. 'The start was anything but a, good one, inkes and Marriott being all abroad while White aud Perry wer3 as quick as Bightning; the latter consequentlyw entofwith a lead, and retained itwellfor some distance, but Hales andMarriott, on nearing Chiswick,began to improve their po3ition, andin the shoot near the Ferry overlapped their opponents, aud fairly shot aheaL The rowing of bothparties, especially of HEaes and Marriott,was worthy of proessed watermen, for they sat the beautiful outrigger in which thev rowedi, and which was far sunerior to their oppoents' bat, as though they had been brought np to the river. At Hammersmith.bridge Hales and Ariott were four or five lengths ahead; and, though a gallant spurt on the, pars of Whito and Perry at the Crabtree slightly diminshed the lead, Hales and MArriott afterwards went further in advance, and won by eight lengths. Never did men row a fner Etemn wager than the losers.
TBIAL FOR .X2DER. TO TE lEDITOBi OF THE ZTMES. Sir,-Being present at the recent important trial for murder at the Central Criminal Court, I was, as a novce, much struck with one Dortion of the proceedings. At that awful juncture when the foreman of the jury had just de-. livered a verdict of " Gnilty" to the silence-stricken Court, the Clerk of Arraigns forAlly announced the dictum of the jury to the prisoner, and as formally demanded of him if he had aught to say why sentence of deLth should not be passed upon him accordng to law ? Hardly had the la-st word been uttered by this official when Mr. Harker's stentorian voice commenced a set form of proclamation, which the prisoner, doubtless in common with the uninitiated part of the audience, deemed preparatory to any observations ho might choose to make; bLt no! it effectually precluded any attempt at remark on his part, and but claimed silence during the passing of sentence by the judge. This done, tne prisoner (in my bearing) applied through his counsel for leave to address the Court, to which Lord Campbell replied "It is too late now," when indeed no time had been allowed him to have uttered a word. I departed impressed with the idea that the fault lay with he crier of the court-his too hastily proceeding -with the proclamation of silence-a proclamation, by the way, always uncalled for at such a. moment of breathless attention; but, from the reports of the more recent trial at York, I perceive that the same plan was followed there, even to the cutting short of an observation commenced by the pri-- soner, who is reported to haive again made an unsuccessful attempt to speak after sentence had 1,een passed upon him. I enclose my authority for this. It may, of course, be said that ample opportunity is afforded the prisoner of clearing himself reviously to the retirement of the jury, and that nothing he might now say could or would serve him. Then why, I ask, mock a man standing in so awful a situation, by asking him to speak, and then sealing his mouth? In England the time has come for the I ;bolition of all unme.ng fors; and surely the judges have power either to abolssh this, or to make it available to the prisoner. We all knwo that, in the case of a female criminal, there is one plea which she 'would not urge in vain in bar of immediate execution, but I know not if this would be the stage at which she or her counsel would raise such plea;. There may, for aught I kno, be some admissible reason in the case of a man why sentence should not be passed; if so, in Heaven's name, give him time to offer it, or, if not, then refrain from so mocking his imisry as to ask |for that which he can by no possibility produce.

THE CAPrAL CNV1CmS.-In the cases of William Dove and James Murdoch, condernned to death for 3nvrder, etrong applieations have been made to the Secretary of State; but upnto this tne Sir George Grey l a seen ne ust grounds for interfering with the due course of law.

Dn&'ra OF' A CnnSAN SOI,DIEBi.ThC Yor.hshire papers record the sudden death of Sergeant Wa31is, a native of Barnsley or the neighbourhood, ander somewhatvpainfu circumstances. Sergeant Wallis, who was in the 2d hat' talion of the hifle Brigade, was ine the whole of the Crimean campsign, and he arrived at Aldershott on Friday week in the enjoyment of good health. On arriving at the cam,D he took off his kcnapsack and coat, and said, "ThasrM God I have arrived safely is. Old England again;* ru ncw have a *ood rest." As soon as he had uttered thtese words he fell down and died instantly upon his'knapsack. Hewas Iorn in t188, and was 20 years of age whea he entered the service. On the brealdng out of the late war his regiment was early under orders for the Crimea, and there he had mnny hair-breadth escapes. At the battle of the Alms, although in its midst saw his comrades fell thiecly around him, he escaped minjured. Ho was hotly engaged in the battle of Inlcermann, which he described as one of the bloodiest battles on record, and where, after firing away all their ammunition, they had to knock out the brains of the enemy with the butt-end of their rides and run them through with their bayonets. He performed trench wvork for n months, during which time he suffered severely, in common with the other troops, from exposure to the atmosphere during cold nights, and from want of food, covering, and other necessaries. While on duty one mighUt a shell from the enemy came over into the trenchandfel at his side, exploded, and smashed the stock of his ri'fe and cut the scabbard of his bayonet in two; but he miraculously escaped injury with the exception of a scratch on the bask of Mns ear. in the assault upon thoRedan, along with some others of his regiment, lhe was in a very dangerous Position being engagedin carrying scaling ladders and wool-bags for t.he assault5 during which time hoe was exposed to showers ogf grape and canister, which mowed dowvn large nuFmbers oÂ£ his comrades. SKmcH OF GaeiEN WAnxx.- At a first glancee General Walker appears a small man; but w.hen standing beside men of the average heighithe appearsatr3'de taller than they. He is very thin-not an ounce of superabundanltflesh upon his bones. The framewVork of his body is small, but he has avery tough aud sinewy appearance. His soldiers say (these who have been with him since the begmnning of Isis adventures) that be can endure more hardship than the stfrongest-looking man in the State. Ee is one of the most industrious of men, and supcervises the entiro affairs of the country. His ordinary dress consists of a p air of conmnon blae pantaloons5 a coarse bluo linen oversisirt, ulpon the shouldees of which two small piece of red flannel do the duty of epauwlettes, and a straw hat. When he sits hne sjettles down *in the most careless manner, his shioulders appearing to contract into a smell oemnass. His ungretnl posture while sitting, wvith his unpretenlding style of dress, is apt to disappoint those who expect to find in him physical dimensions proportionateoto the s tread of his fame.

The combination of Conservatives, Anti-Maynooth men, and Teetotallers arrayed against Mr. Black, a consuitent veteran of the dibeadl cause-and especial his de sr^tion by his old friend and feUow-worker in it, Mr. M'Lazen-naturally became the subject of pointed rearnzk bythe Scotsiw nl wluch, from the rest of the Edinburgh rMess beig either neutrag or actively rrlayed on the other side, hasd then to fighlt single-hanuded the keen but successful battle forMr. Black In theheatof the contest, however t.he &tot.saiesn undoulbtedly suffered itself to fall into, unduly strong langua ge, as the following pragraphs founded on at 7he trial'will*show:- " Mr. s'Laren's long and absolute rule over his followers is ani undeniable prod f of his powser of mind and will; but all things have thein limi s, and surely ba yesterday overs"epAd the hounds perontted to him even by the most eletr oand besotteh of hisfollovest.

The like of it, we venture to Eay, was never seen befora at any Edinburgh meeting, however low in character, and though presided over by the huzmblest man or the Leenest partisan. Every elector who rose to exerCise his right of speech or uation was received wzith a volley of taunt and insolence trom the chair; and, if he happened to have once been a member of the chairman's own committee (meaning the Liberal committee, t -which Mr. Mlenformerly belonged) so much the more wss he insulted and browbeaten. " There is no man of whom, though we would it had been otherwise, we haive had to say harder things than of Mr. Duncan :I'Laren. At this moment, not insidiously, but to his teeth, we c harge him with deserting principles and traducing friends and deceiving enemies, and acting only for his own purposes, and especially his own mnlignties."1 The firstof theseparagraph3 referred to a speech of Mr. !d?Laren, at Queen-street-hall, in which, among other ceiticisms on MDr. Blacs's qualifications, he adverted to his being shove 70, and t the probability of his not suriving a twelvemoth if he entered on committee vwork, The second alluded to a meeting at which Mr. h'Laren took an un. usually prominent part for a chairman, and in partieuLar received the questioners of the other party with emarks which had the effect of turning the laugh of one part of the meeting upon them, and Dro ducing a sympathetic irritation nmong the rest. Teere were also some metrical squibs and fictitious advertLisements founded upon, and the issue put to the u w "Whether the said articles, passages, verses, and fictitious advertisement, or any parts thereof, are of and concerning the pursuer; and whether the pursuer is thereby calumnniously ard injuriously held up to public hatred, cortempt, and ridi-ule, to his loss and damage " The damages were hsid at 1,0001. There were, also, references in several of the articles and, verses to an oppro. brions epithet applied, in 1852, to Mr. MÂ¶Laren, by Sir William John;ton, a former Lord Provost of the city, at which 3Mr. M%taren also felt aggrieved. Evidence was led for the pursuer, to the effect that the articles referring to the meetings were not justified by his conduct at them; that his remarks on M1r. Black at the first meeting were fair and even kind ; and that, as chair. zman of the second meeting, he gave both sides a fair hear- alg. The defenders sought, but were not allowed, to out in the articles of otber newspapers at the time, to sh6\ the heated language thatwas used on the other side of the contest; nor were they aloweed to refer to former speeches by Mfr. ?I.aren to prove thathe himself sometimes used strong language of others. They, however, were enabled to prove that Mr. M'Laaen had, in 1552, denouneed (though hypothetically) Mfr. Brown Denglas as a " calumniator," and that he had also described another parson, understood to be Sir W. Johnston, as having betrayedletvery friendhehadfor tlhelast 2O years. They brought evidence also to prove that Mr. M'Laren's first speech was a "cruel and unfeeling" one, and that his con uct in the chair at the second meeting was unfair. The DE i.r of FACrrTY, in his speech for the pursuer, contended that these articles were not only unjustifiable, but exceeded even the license that could be allowed at an election period. Eemsintaineathat they were a succession ! of calunmious attacks, most injurious to r. M'Laren's Dnublic and private character, and called for such a sum of aamages as would sufliciently express the jury's sense of the [injury he had received. The LORD AD'VOt'&on replied for the defenders, contending that Mr. lIPLarea was the lest man who should have come into court with such a case, he himself being generally regardiess as to his language respecting political opponents, and that the articles of the Scoisman, if not moderate and well founded, were certainly dithin the limit of electioneering debate, and only such las were used bythe press and even Parliament every day. lis Lordship war2mly appealed to the jury to protect the liberty of thr,press, whicahhelheld to be at stake in this triaL The LORn Jue=CE CLERK directed the jury that the casewas one eminently fortheir decision, and remarked that they need not be deterred from giving redresa if they thought it was due, by any fear of restricting the liberty of the press, as their verdict could oly affiect this articular ease, and the press was idways safe in a jury's hands. The jury, after 20 mnbtes' deliberati.on, returned a verdict for the pnsuser.-Damages 400!. The result was receivedwith considerable cheering inthecourt. It has, however, exdited considerable sensation and conflict of opinion out of doors.

I StICTh OF A YOUNG liafY Il? A 13AnG I cnCmv.-On Tuesa y last the visitors and inhabitants of Wal ton-on-the-lTaze ware greatly distressed by the circumstance of a young wioman, about 22 years of age, having committed suicide on Tuesday last in one of the bathig mnachines. Our correspondent states that the decease, whose reputed name was Snell, about three months since arrived at Walton from London; and, up to the time of her death, occupied apartments at 2fr. Shermarn's, orth-street. She had with her an infant si nmonths old, -whose guardian she represented herselfto be, and for some time past it had been observed that her spirits were greatlv denressed, neglecb and the scanty means at her command eiidently preying heavily on her mind. It had been noticed also that, since the arrival of visitors, shehas sought the ntmost seclusion, even to absenting herself from public -wor ship, and, nn Saturday lat, it appears, she -went to Col chester, wsnere she raised funds by iledging her watch, &c. On her return, alter disochrging some pressing claims, she intimateaher intention to leave for London on the morning ofthe catstrophe, She, however, instead of doing so, re- ,dre&tothe sans ascthigh tae and -ngaoed a nachine for the avowed purpose of bathing. The attendant suggeted that, as sie was a str.nger and alone, his daughter should accompany. her, but the offer was politely declined, and the machine wa at her re uest laceda out in deep water. After a lapse of about minutes, sose ladies bathing from the adjoin. ing machine observed some clothes floating under the curtains of that of the decemsed, and, their attendant failing to obtain a reply.from tht quarter, search was made, when the lifeless body of the young lady above alluded to was discovered, her head being flrmly.fixed downward under the bathing steps of the machine. Her shawl and bonnet enlyhad been removed].

This, added to her abandon. ment by most of her family, no doubt led to this da&w&. ing eveat, which has cast a gloom over the entire dietrict. SeverAl documents have ilso been discovered, wlich wre to 'ee prodod at the rnqXiest, and which may tend* to exphida the cause of so direfu a catastrophe.
