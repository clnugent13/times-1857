ILA TO THE XDITOH ON TEi HTIME. f , Sir,-Of the evila whic Xnom uamit of legli atesf,rgaje some may happily be ,edressea l ypublic opinion one of these I take tSe liberty of appeling to 'oa1or powerful interposition. Of- the mauy- travellers hio *vik.t this partkof Scolland some,_I think, muat hare bein#:i: by one remarkable feature. &long the conru of- the Dii ana its tributaries, from Aboyne to Blair Athol, there stretches for a length of upwards of 50 miles a range ot deer forest nearly unbroken on t;he south side of thie riwv and often diTerging from it, to sprted fir on the nortli: tif !nyone penetrates these tracts'of old primasvl firn, bircb, wood,andthe rangesofgranitehills,they will hardlyfLnd-any soene moreimpre,sive and yetnone more melancholy, for o,ti thisenormoustract,inglens oncebusywith hamlets, and oii the flauks of hils, once living with sheep, not a house iM be seen but the smart lodges of a few gamekeepers, and: :no a streak of smoke or sound of life through all these dreary solitudes. Bide forsmilesandyot-will not discover aUlini creature but the woowpigeon which rises out of the forest, and the roe deer, which hardly notices your approuch. The red deer, for whom this solitude is created, are during tlis season on the height, and not a step disturbs the silence to which, for their sakes, this tact has been consigned. Natives who knovw this country wel mark out to yos the places, now heaps of ruiasn where the farmhouses of a thriving tenantry once existed, and hard by the cottages of their labourers. Old men, mounming over the change and having seen their friends depart, tell you that you will find the inhabitants of Braemar no longer in their glens, but in Canada and the States; professional gentlemen, not much inclined to romance, tell you that these statements are not exaggerated, and that the change is as striking and mel ncholy to them as to the stranger. It is difficult for a politician to hear all this and not to feel that; these valleys were once the homes of a brave and active race, who supplied our armies during the Peninsular war, anc who would have supplied them again had we suffered them to remain. If this change affected only one part of Scot. land-if it wvas a belt of depopulation, drawn like a girdlq round its waist, we might be silent. But when we re;ect; that the same process of clearing is at work in Forfar, Ross and Inverness, when it is spreading rapidly through the Highlands, with the spread of fashion and of sport, it is time that we should ask for it the notice of the public. Let; it, however, be uxderstood to what part of Highland sport we objec'. They have been, till lat-ly, useful to both countries; attraci;ing wealth to the Highlands and supply. ing to Englishmen an active and exhilirating amusement. But tlhere is nothing-tusocial or mischievous in grouse. shooting. It does not interfere with industry. The sheepfarnerand thesportsmango handinhand. Deer-stalking isa sport of a diffierent kind; it belongs to a savage state, but it is incompatible with industry. The deer live alone ; their life and the life of man are at variance; where they exist the crops of the peasant are laid waste; the approsch even of the step of man is to them a terror. To provide, therefore, a home for them, man, and all his works must be banished. How niany thousand persons have. been driven out of the valleys of the Highlands in order to malke room for the deer would be weU worth your inquiry. Bat that, we shonld reduce a great part of a country to a savage solitude for the sake of sport seems to me indefensible. At all events, let the public understand what a deer forest is, and at what price it is bought, when they read, as they soon vill do in your paper, that Mr. A- and Colonel D- have had excellent sport in the forest, that Lord r?made a famous shot, right and left, at twvo stags. Lot it bet 'onderstood that, in order to enjoy a few weeks' diversion in the autmnn, to inEcueafew keepers and gilies to drive a berd of deer past the stands in which some English gentle. men are ensconced, hundreds of homesteadshave been pulled dlovn, scenes of active industry have been closed, homes oE humble comfort have been destroyed, and hundreds of families, who loved their Highland glens with the deep aittatchment of Highlanders; have been banished across the seas like felons, though without a crume. It is against this evil, which is now large and unhappily progressing that l venture to malce my appeal to you. I am satisfied that the evil has arisen carelessly, and from the attraction of Eport. I cannot but hope that reflection and discussion wvill put it down. There is no greater pleasure to a proprietor than to see a thriving tenantry improved by hi, core. The Highland proprietor, who is rewarded with a generous attachment, will not suffer himself to be a party driving out a noble race ofmen and supplanting them with red deer; and, whatever may he the delights of sport, I should blush for Englishmen if we consented to buy our amusements ati such a price as the depopulation of a part of Scotland, and the removal of some of its hardiest .nd mos'; industrious inhabitants. Allow me to commend this matter to your consideration, and to subscribe myse7l, Your oAM,eimnt --.r I A TRAVELLBR THROUGII BRAEMAR. I BraeiaT, Aug. 4*
PUBZItC WORKS IN IrDIA. TO THE EDITCO OF TEE TIMES. Sir,-I shall fecI obliged by your inserting in your colanis the following remaris, in answer to a paragraph contained in a letter published in Tkhe Times of last Thursday, and signed "W. F. Fergusson." The paragraph aludedto is as follows :-"I have no hesi. tation in saying, that a railway company starting without a guarantee would, notwithstanding any statement or declaration to the contrary, be considered as not countenanced or supported by Government, and that it would encoun*tr endless difficulties and obstacles, so that the enterprisa would very speedily be brought to a stop, if not ruined, by the acts of the persons who are now intrusted w ith virtualy uncontrolled power and authority throughovut the interior of the country." In ansver to the above gratuitous statement of Mr. W. F. Fergusson, I take leave to assert (and in this I am sure 7 shaL be confirmed by those who, from thleir personal experience, are well acquainted wvith the administration of the Iloc-d Government of India) that the Government of India exercises as perfect a control over all its civil and military servants as any Government in Europe does overthose whce are employed in the administration of its affairs; and its orders when given to its civil and mriiI tary servants ass as faithfully and effectually obeyed and carried into effect, as those of any European State. From my own experience, now of several years, as a director of an Indian Railway Company ithe Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railvway), I can affirm vith perfect truth, th;at so far as the conduct of the EBas India Company's servants who are intrusted vwith power and authority in the interior of India is concerned, our managers and agents in India have always cxperienced f:om them the most ready, cordial, and active co-operation in carrying out their 'eiews. So far from showing any disposition to exercise their authority to oppose or thwart, they have invariably been the foremost to do everything in their power to aid, promote, and facilitate t'he obiects of an undertalding. Why an unguaranteed railway, having tha express aud pu'blicly declared countenanme and support of the Indian Government, should be thwarted and opposed by the servants of the East India Company intrnsted with power and authority in the interior of the country, any more than a guaranteed railway is difficult to comprehend. Mr. W. F. Fergusson gives us no reason in support of his assertion, and we may fairly assame -that he has none toF give. In the next paragraph of his letter, however, Mr. W. F. Fergusson says that "any injurious pros ceedings of such a character would be corxected in time and in due and reglar course." Thisis some consolation, indeed, for undertalaings without a gaarantese But surely a Government which would " in time and in due and regular course" correct any injurious proreedings on the part of its servants is a Government 'Which, we may assume, would take care ab issti4 that th ose servauts only should be intrsl ed with power and authority Who were mo't only comnpetent to exercise, but would know that t was their duty to exercise, such power and authority in. fartherance of the public anid deelarcd orders o£ the Government. Bat, Sir, this alleged refrac-oriness on the part of the servants of the Government of India in opposing its express and pnblic decarationso£. their Government- in favour of a paricular undertaking, because not guaranteed is an unworthy calumny on that; Govermment and its servants, and quite inconsistent with the fact, that there are large and important undertakings in India (witness for example, among many others, the East; Indian Iron Compan:y and two coal comp?nies, of one of which, I believe, Mr. Feguson was limsolf a director) which have been brought out and carried t' a saccessfl,l resut vithout any Government gnarantee. - tARTTRM.T.

Er. REMUSAFS " ENGLAND 1 IN TH BIGfTBENBTH OENTURY."* Under the above title M. Charles de inmusat has republished, writh ctnsiderable additions, a series! of essays which had previously' appeared in thel '.Z.eares des Dtutx Mfosaic5, and has pre'aced them vrith 'an introductionl written in 1852, and w?hich is *equally characteristic of the distingushed constitutionalist and of the scenes of which he has been xecently a spectator. The times, as he ha experi- enced, have indeed vastly changed since first he' laboured at such congenial themes; but, like the Guizots, Villemains, and Montalemberts, his convictions have remaaned ucconquered by the urgency of events. the course of which he proudly declines to follow. His opinions, as he boast, are antiquated, but he recognizes the obligation to act as he thinks, and to write in accordance with his conffumed judgiment. It demands courage, as he con'ceives, to occupy the public at this moment with the history of the English Government, for the subject by means of the revulsion which constitutes fashion is passe de mode. F?rance and England are filmly allied, and he rejoices in their alliance, but the French partisans of the alliance are not the warmnest admirers of Eng,lish institutions, while the ancieut admirers of these institutions are cold supporters of the alliance. He writes, therefore, with a misgiving that he may please no one,but he writes sea onably, as he hopes, and we are witnesses that he writes well. HIe justifies himself, first of all, from the presumed reproach that he seeks a "ptVint d'aopj1s" for his 'political principles in the example of a foreign country, and quotes precedents, therefore, which may have weight with his compatriots. Fenelon, 3Ilademoiselle de rEspina=e, and Turgot are his chief examples. Of Mirabeau he cites a letter to Champfort in 1784-" Si le mieux peut trouver placecbezles Bretons, oe sera quand les autresnations :Euror,ennes seront arrivees i leur niveau. Is philosophe doittendre a- cette R6volution avant de desirer l'autre." But England has not rested at the level it had attained in the days of MIirabeaut; it has not mistaken immobility for perfection, but has entered energetically the path of refo.m. Hence the misgivings which have arisen in the minds of continental statesmen, including Talleyrand. Hence the dictum of the latter on the passing of otur Reform Bill-" Ce qui 6tait inebranlable ne rest plus; je me dis que cela, mais je dis cela." Hence those i- pressions of our insecurity which Montalembert also hias combated, and to which the events of the last eight or 10 years have contributed the doubts so recei.tly thrown upon points regarded as settled. These impressions M. de Remusat is studious to disclaim for the credit of those he has cited, for that of his own consisten,cy, and for the sake of that distinction between trie reforming and revolutionary tendencies with which England is familiar, but which France has for a time forgotten. The revolutionary spirit, he repeatedly contends, is not the noble spirit which animates the authors of revolutions 'which are really necessary; it is the love of revolutions for themselves. It is the continuous movement of masses without a standard, vhom imuagination governs in default of reason, and for whom novel ideas are alone true and extreme ideas alone logical. The revolutionary spirit is not the attachment of a Hollander to the Revolution of 159, of an Englishman to the Revolution of 1688, of an American to the Revolution of 1770, but of a :Frenchman to the Revolution of 1789. It is the love of revolutions 'without end. It forms no attachment to the advantages it has acquired; it knows not how to retain the conquests it has made. Its -course is easily depicted, and in a very short phrase -4ovt r6rer, touit tenter, mopess de tout perdre. In contradiAtinction froin this spirit, M. de R3musat dwells approvingly on the English type, and on those of his countrymen who have studied and imitated its nianifestatic.ns. After the Revolution of 1789 had given France equality, there remained the task to give liberty to the society thus constituted. It may have been a difficult, but it was not a desperate enterprise to seek to erect liberty -on such a novel foundation. At a'l events, liberty was only possibly attainable through the observation and study of existing facts, and it could not be -derived from any mere theory or conception. What, then, w%ere the prominent facts?f-that liberty in anodein civi]iza-ion had only two examplars, England and the United States, and that of these the circumstances of England bore the nearest resemblance to those of France. Hence it was that England, from 1815, occupied so large a space in the thoughts of all vho really reflected on political subjects. For 60 yeais they emp'oyed that constitutional language to which England had previously given a meaning, and for the same extended term, independently of expression.s, the paraLel developments of England were the profound study of theirlives. As for himself, AL. de Renusat declares that the dream of his existence was " LeGouvernementAnglais dans lasocietd Frangaise." He had contemplated it thus admirinaly under the Restoration, under the monarchy of 1830, and under the Republic ; and why, he asks, should he regard it otherwise now ? As for the objections,- "Qei ne les connait? Quand j'-tais A. l'cole on les imprimaitaanife teur. Iea de6fensearsde lancien r6gime les oat r6p6t6eo apres les Cerivains de 1'Empire. Personne ne dim mienx qu'ils n'ont dit. On devrait bien s'epargner les repetitions, et quand on vants Is force ne pas feindre .qu'on inroque la raison." This objection to repetitions may apply more impartially than AL de R1musat conceives, but, for our own part, we should be loth to sustain it at all if it could be held to imply that there was anything in the least superfluous in MI. de Wimusat's vindication of his own preference for Lberty. As for those who have left his side avowedly, and who claim to have changed their opinons on suffi-cieat grounds, his estimation of those grounds is JUSt, hut uncomplimentary. They are not, however, taunted with a change of opinion, but with deciining the change of position which is the proper atonement for a life of error. Those who now approve the confutation of their theories have, he says, but one course to take,-" La retraite dolt suivre Is conversion; vous vous repentez, allez a La Trappe. Mais ils 'entensdent aut-ement. La penitence les ranene du c6tS de la fortune. Ils expient leurs 4garements dans l'or et La soie; ils veulent faire de repentir profit." Thus the laughers are not exclusively those 'who win, so long' as M 1. de Remusat scan pursue the latter with such effective irony. For himself, he confesses to his deficiency in respect of the flexibility which is so fashionable, and he refers this last proof that he retains his ancient principles to the visit which he paid to England in -the latter days of Lou:s Philippe:- *' Je venais ici rendre un supreme hommage au passe. Le roi touchait 5 es derniers jours. 11 ne me pa-la que de la atrie. El je revois maintenant celtl terre, asile de tous. est ici le lieu, c'est le moment de revenir attentivement sur les peusEes et les evenements de notre vie, pour passer au feu de reanience les saintes verites qui charmaient la jeunmS e du siacle, et dont ss maturitd se lasse.

.FOGS ON THE NTORTHUMBRLAND COAST.-SI S. Angust 5.-On Sunday evnenin a dense fog came roling in from the sea, and speedily o%senred the Northumberland coast. In consequence of the previous three days having been unprecedentedly hot,on Sunday a great number of persons came down from Newcastle-on-.Tne and the other large towns to the sesaside villages. About 8 o'clock some scores of parties were off Tynemonth Point in small boats, enjoying the sea air, when they were all suddenly enveloped in the foz, without any object in sight to guide them to the shore. The cries of the women, heard through the mist, were very distressing, and several boatmen put off to their rescue. Bells were alo -rung in Prior's-haven, and other Lmethods were 'adopted to guide the lost voyagers towards the shore. There were, fortunately, several herring boats outside, fLshing, and the men belonging to them and some 'yne steamtugs managed to pick Un the majority of the lost landsmen- the last of them, however, were not rescued until about midnight. On Monday morning several, large steamtugs w6ith pleasure partes left the Tyne to proceed to different places along the coast, and in the afternoon the fog came on quite as dense as on Sunday svening. Great anxiety was expressed with regard to the retur of those boats, but a considerable number of the parties returned home by train. One large steamer, however, with a considerable party did not reach here until 6 o'clock this moring. Their friends, as:sniight have been expected, had spent the nirght upon the quay anxiously waiting their return. The Othello, of WhItby, got- on the Hurd Sand in the fog yesterday, but loated ff in the evening tide. In comir.g up Shields ha.-bour she ran upon the insand with k-er stern, and did considerable damage to a tier of vessels.

After regular hours there was a decline of an eighth. To-morrow is settling day in Consols, and the necessity for closing or carrying forward a number of specldative operations for a rise created general heaviness, the demand for money being at the same time extremely active.

The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 70f. 60c. for money, and 70f. 70c. for the end of the month, showing a recovery of between an eighth and a quarter per cent. The Committee of Spanish American Bondholders have published an opinion obtained from Dr. Robert Phillimore on the position of the debt of Venezuela. The case submitted recounted the terms of arrange. mnent between the Government of Venezuela and the bondholders in 1840, and the subsequent violation of the decrees which, in conformity therewith, set aside certain revenues for their benefit. It also stated that the amount of the revenues misappropriated is 583,9101., while the arrears due to-the bondholders are 586,9881., and concluded by requesting an opinion as to the best means of enforcing their rights. In reply, Dr. Phillimore points out that the question'is thus raised whether the interference of the British Government would be authorized by the principles of international law, and, after announcing that there cannot be the least doubt that such is the fact, and that reprisals might he resorted to, he advises the bondholders " to lay their case at once before the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and humbly to request the intervention of the Government on their behalf." It was stated yesterday that the prospect of obtaining a concise and unprejudiced exposition of the simple fact involved in the controversy between the members of the London Life Association seemed hopeless, and it was therefore contemplated not to continue the discussion. The following letter, however, since received, states the case of the parties who consider themselves aggrieved in a manner so sbort and clear that, if the advocates for the opposite view will imitate its brevity, the public will possibly be able to arrive at an impression as to the side which should prevail. The first letter of the writerhas been assailed because it was "anonymous," but this charge is rarely made except when there is a disposition to anger. It is enough that he is known to The Times to be respectable. Beyond that, the public can have no interest except in the force of his arguments, and it is hard, therefore, to conceive for what reason a name can be demanded, unless waith the idea that it may operate, as in France, to prevent the free expression of opinion under the dread of personal annoyance Many of the most influential and scrupulous members-of the commercial community are disposed to shim notoriety, although they court publicity for their views, and if the curiosity regarding individual names is at all times to be satisfied in cases where it can have no bearing on the point at issue the public will be deprived of much information and many valuable warnings:- " Sir,-In this age of sophistication, I am glad to find that there remains, at least, a sensitiveness to the charge of breach of engagement. With your usual perspicacity you have hit the nail on the head-' Wi the promises held out to the new members be in any way jeopardized by the con- templated act? I suppose even Mr. Robert Baxter wiU admit that the proposed division must prove injurious to the younger members. The question only then remains what were the promises held out ? The directors of a public body are usually considered in the city as the exponents of its acts, and in this case the directors publicly say that the proposed attempt of division wi involve a breach of engge. ments. In my own case, it may bh true, as Mr. Baxter alle-es, that no absolute pledge was given to me; but an impied pledge was. I received printed statements from the office, and also information from the gentlemen wvho are its officers, that on payment of the stipulated premiums I would have a reduction of 70 per cent. (subject, of course, in a mutual insurance to any unforeseeni calamity). Having then been admitted as a partner by the old. members, I am entitled to a foiU participation in the profits. If the old membors erred in admitting participators on too easy terms (as they think), let them folow the example of the "Old Equitable," and constitute distinct classes for new members. Let them also folow the example of the " Old Equitable," which, to its honour be it said, on a similar attempt utterly routed the parties. Can Mr. Baxter name any one office in which such conduct as he attempts has been sanctioned? "Permit me, Sir, this opportnDity to offer my humble tribute of thanks to the directors, who, under difficulties of no ordinary magnitude, have so manfully withstood these attempts. In so far Rs they are concerned, they have nobly upheld the mercantiie characterof the city; and it only now remains for the members on the ballot on the 13th inst. to do their duty. " I am, Sir, your obedient servant, "August 6. ".*' W." At a meeting -of the Mexican Bondholders held to-day, Mr. C. MI'Garel in the chair, the report of the committee (an abstract of which has appeared in The Times) was adopted, together with resolutions enforcing their claims upon the attention of the Mexican Government. A memorial was also agreed to, which is to be forwarded throug the Foreionofiice to President Comonfort, wfith the view of inducing him to consent to an arrangement for seculring the appropriation of the proportion of revenue set apart for the payment of thedividends. The interposition of Lovrd Glarendon continues to be sought in support of the claims of the bondholders, and it is contended that the remittances illegally detained and passed to the accounlt of the Government can be recovered, as, under the agreement with MIexico, they have virtually become the private revenue and property of B3ritish subjects. In the course of the discussion ib was suggested that if the Mexican Government persist in. the flagrant viola~tion of their solemn engagements it will be well for the creditors to fall back upon the terms of the original bond, and demand payment of the whole amount. The American authorities are, it is said, preparing to acquire further territorial influence in this direction, and if their citizens become interested in the debt they will be enabled to urge a more speedy settlement than any that can be hoped for through the interference of the E£nglis h Gaoverunment. It was, however, explained that the arrangement nder -which the last conversion was carried out precludes the bondholders from assuming their original position, although, at the time, endeavours were made to maintain that privi]ego. Thnis intimation led to a discussion respecting the inirolicyof consenting to conversions, and the losses which have accrued througzh the compromises effected wsith Spain, Portugal, Chiili, Venezuela, NBew Granada, EBcuador, and other States were traced to a too ready acquiescence in adopting the various proposals. It was admitted that, with the exception of Chill (whose subsequent financial conduct has been without blemish), the results of these operations have been most, disastrous, the respective Goveramnents (aiter having obtained the desired Iconcessions) having wholly neglected to provide the stipulated in terest, At the conclusion of the pro- ceeeings the committee tendered their resignation, but afterwards undertook to retain office for a short period longer. The duties will now be confided to a limited number, with Mfr. Robertson as chairman, Mr. M'Garel vacating that seat, but affording occasional services, while 3Mr. Moxon has been added to the committee. The directors of the Riga Railway Company have adopted the proper course of laying the whole of the documents and correspondence relating to the concession of that line before the Committee of the Stock-Exchange. Th e M ,aritime and Land Isurance Company of the Empire of Brazil, with a capital of about 1,800,0001., have established a branch agency in L ondon for insurances in connexion with the Brazil and River Plate trade. They. are represented by hMessrs. MIaud, M'Gregor, and Co. A difference of opinion in the Board of Directors of the Great Western Railway of Canada has led to the retirement of-Mr. J. B. Smith, MP. It is smid that the question at issue was the propriety of enitering into- engagements witl a now line in Canada which Mr. Smith thought -would be a valuable adjunct to the Greit W ternmRailway, 'while ois I colleagues-felt that, after the strong express on of opinion in the resolutions Ai, the late general meetingA of the shareholders in this country, they were precluded frox conmmitting fhe company to any new lines or branches -ithout the previous sanction of the proprietors. The following letter refers to the cireumstance, mentioned yesterday, of the ilames of Messrs. Gill, of Bath, having been inserted without authority in the prospectus of the South-Western Hotel Association. The explanation given is perfectly satisfactory, but in the absence of any knowledge of the accident by which the improper use of his name had occurred Mr. Gill performed a public duty in calling attention to it:- "2, Royal Exchange-building Aug 6. "Sir,-We can readily explait the blunder that s occurred respecting the appearance of Mr. Gill's name in a prospectus of tho 'SouthWestern Hotel Association.' A committeo of shareholders of the 'Ilaw Reversiony Interet Societv' had received authority from the Mr. Gills, of Bath, asndsix other gentlemen, to add their names to a list of 80 solicitors and others who had siAped an address to the directors of the 'Ilaw Reversionary !Society,' but by a blunder of the printer (who had also printed the prospectuses of tho 'South-Western Hotel Association') these eight names were appended to 12 prospectuses of that association, instead of to 2copies of the addess to the directors of the 'Law Reversionary Itterest Society;' and as copies of a correspondence on the subject of tbat society were being forwarded to the Mr. Gils and to the other six gentlemen, eopies of the hotel prospectus were at the same time forwarded, the interpolation of their names not having been discovered; so that the erroneoius prospectuses were forwarded solely to the members of the Law ReversionArylnterest Society, and, of course, none of those names have ever appeared in any advertissment whatever, nor in any other prospectuses, as 'will appear from the advertisements insertedt in he Times and other paperS list week.

IONDOA, THURSDAY, AUGCUST 7, 1856. We lhave recently felt it our duty to p-oteat against that recldess impatience wh'ch depreciates the utility and despises the privileges of a Legia3ative Assembly. We have denounced it as ,one of the most dangerous symptoms of our social politics; as evidencing a forgetfulness of the liberties -which are involved in Parliamentary free-. doci of speech and the price which was paid for their attainment; and as indicating a propensity wllich, under the influences of commercial prosperity or -nconstitutional despotism, might degen-erate into absolute servilify. We have proteded' alrinst it the more because the prezent age aIready sees too many examples of nations abandoning the love of freedom and barteringthe birthright of self-govermment for the questionable advantage of an energetic centralization; and we are convinced that from the moment the nations of Europa are- infected with this preference of " action"2 to discussion-of things done by a Government to debates raised by a Legislature-from that moment Wil be destroyed the strongest bulwarks of national dignity, greatness, and self-reliance. Nothing could be more appalling to all rational lovers of freedom than the universal spectacle of governmental machinery acting with such correctness, celerity, and aptitude as to dispense with the expression of national opinion and the collision of popular aiscussion. It was for this, among other reasons, that we especially deprecated a war with the people of the UJnited States of America, as being not only a kindred race with ourselves, but the only other nation in the -world whose representative institutions were based upon the same principles and enjoyed the same liberty as ouir own. To have pitted two such countries in a sanguinary contest against one another would have been to offer a holocaust of precious blood on the altarsof chuckling and derisive despotism throughout the world, to have armed tyranny with new weapons, and to have strangled the nament efforts of oppressed nations struggling to get free. The sympathy which thus attaches us to thne constitution of the United States is derived from those feelings which make us cherish our owvn-a love of country, a love of independence, a love of free speech. WVe believe that representative insti'utions never were and never could be enjoyed by a people who did not entertain these feelings. But, though these are indispensable to the creation, thev are not sufficient for the preservation, of such a constitution. There must be a respect for order to check the license, a reverence for authority tO restrain the turbtulence of popuxar assemblies. Without this restraint and cheek a convention of senators sinks to the level of a street mob or a beargarden. That it is easy-or, at any rate, not difficult-to reconcile the legitimate and necessary freedom of debate with that propriety and decorum without which the framers of our laws would inspire no respect, and our laws themselves obtain no obedience, is proved by the proceedings of our two Legislative Chambers. Discussions may be tedious-bores may too fiequently obtrude themselves-the forms of Parliament may be too often resorted to for the purpose of evading or postponing a diareeable question, but how rarely does either House present the spectacle of an indecorous fracas or a turbulent collision ! We believe that, excepting one case which happened in the House of Lords on the passing of the Reform Bill, and another in the House of Commons during the Irish debates, there is hardly a scene which could be cited as inconsistent with the dignity and selfrespect of a Legislative Assembly. Perhaps we are unable to estimate aright the value of such demeanour. We may approximate to it by reading the criticisms occasionaly put forth by continental i journalists on the personal hostilities of the senators and representatives of the American Congress. These censures are often suggested by rencontres, unseemly enough, in provincial Legislatures, and which the critics confound with the collective meeting of the States; and when the mischief occurs in a provincial Legislature it is not of very serious consequence; but it is a very different thing when it occurs in the great deliberative Parliament of the whole Union. Then, indeed, may those who hate free institutions chuckle, and those who love them grieve. Among the most shocking-to our notions, at least-was the assault recently committed by the representative of South Carolina, MIr. BRoors, on M§r. SUsmN, Senator of Massachusetts. The provocation was a speech delivered in the Senate by the latter on the side of the Abolitionists. The speech was elaborately strong, but not stronger than many delivered within the walls of our own Parliament during the discussion on the Reform and Emancipation Bills. But it was strong enough to excite Mr. BRooxs, a member of the Lower House, to the commission of what we should call a monstrous outrage. He assaulted MIr. SumxxP. while seated writing at a table in the Senate, strucl him severely with a cane over the head, and left him insensible. Great indignation was excited in the Eastern States and in Congress. A motion was made, on the requisition of the Senate, for the expulsion of Mr. BRnorS, which failed, not because it did not obtain an actual majority of votes, but because it did not obtain the legal majority required. Upon this MIr. BR0ooS resigned his seat, and took leave of the House of Representatives in a speech which not only did not contain any apology for the assault, but boldly justified it, and claimed the sympathies of the world. It is this conduct which strikes us with astonishment. We can understand that in the hot conflict of passions and interests between the Abolitionists and the Emancipationists one leg-islator might be so far carried away bv his impetuosity as to strike another. But we cannot figure to ourselves a legislator deliberately and premeditatedly watching his opportunity to assail a man sitting at his desk in another House of Legislation, striking him before he could rise, beating him in the presence of his colleagues, and finally justifying this sacrilege against the national dignity to the assembled delegates of the people. Where this can be done so coolly as it seems to have been done by Mr. BROOKS we are inclined to fear that the license of action and immunity from control among the members of the American Congress are tendirg towards that line whi,ch separates extreme liberty from reactionary and vindictive despotism. 3Mr. BRoors in his speech entirely ignores the principle that Congress has a national and collective character. In his eyes it is only a fortuitous conglomeration of individual atoms, each as good as its neighbour, and the whlole not a bit better than any one. Its right to regulate the conduct of members within its walls, to maintain order, to suppress violence, he regards as questionable or dangerous. "I dco not," says he, "believe that "the spirit of American freedom wourld tolerate "slander in high places, and permit a member of "Congress to publish and circulate a libel "on another, and then call upon either House "to protect him against the personal responsi"bilities which he had thus incurred." That is to say nobody had any right to say anything against slavery without being prepared to fight or be caned on the spot. A rational and effectual inducement to free discussion this! Of course, we do not enter into the niceties of the constitutional question whether MIr. BRoors committed a breach of Parliamentary privilege, inasmuch as his victim was a member of the other, and higher House, though it would be curious in this country to hear a member of the House of Commons deprecate a similar charge on the groand that he had r,nly assaulted a Peer in one of the committee-rooms. Nor do we very clearly see why Mr. BRooKs should have embarrassed himself with the constitutional argument at all, for he has a theory of his own which proudly overrides all constitutional and legal niceties whatever. It is simply to cane or send a challenge to any member of either House who denounces his attack on Mr. SuaRrx; and one of these challenges, sent to a Connecticut legislator, he actually read to the listening representatives. A gentleman so ready with his cartel need hardly descend to the trivialities of constitutional privilege. 'We are irl general averse from criticizing the peculiarities of foreign countries and Governments. re- know that much that seems to us strange and quizzical may proceed from ause3 with w:hich we are imperfectly acquainted, and be palliated by accompaniments which less forcibly attract our notice. We ]mow also how exaggerated and overcoloured is the converse criticism of our£elves by foreign hands. We ihould be particularly cautious in commenting upon the more strange anomalies in the political or social conditions of a new country like the United States, wvhich is still in its growth and immaturity. But community of feeling, constitutional sympathies, and the. knowledge that both we and they are jealously watched by the haters of free institutions prompt us to warn them that sceies like those which we have cited, and declarations like those made by Mr. BRooxs, are a discredit and a dishonour to free representative government. It is for the people and those whom they send to Congress to correct this unseemly defect, ere time, license, and toleration have made it irremediable.
We live in an age of revivals. Ancient rubrics are revived by one party, medi eval tournaments by another, old civic guilds by another. But who would have thought that our old friend Sylvanues UTrban would have started up at this time of day from his long antiquarian repose to assume the attitude of a political luminary, correct the errors of English statesmanship, and enlighten us on the subject of the Russian war ! This worthy old gentleman has long laboured in a department almost peculiar to himself, and we would not for a moment undervalue his services. Who can presume to pass over or depreciate the result of those long years of deep scholastic devotion to the profound mysteries of the treasurehouse of time-to questions topographical, heraldic, genealogical, sepulchral-to criticisms on ancient tumuli and urns, British helmets, Saxon tunics, Norwegian spears ; on old wood. carvings and old ironwork of all styles; Elizabethau wardrobes, chimney-pieces, and State chairs; on ancient door-handles, ancient bolts and bars, ancient kettles and saucepans, ancient harness, ancient wheels, ancient wheelbarro'ws? But, while we do not at all undervalue these researches,we must confess ourselves a little surprised at this sudden interruption to them. Who could expect to pass suddenly from a disquisition on a TuDo£t sidesaddle to a political manifesto of a leading member of the Eouse of Conmmons ? Poverty, however, makes strange bedfellows, and a party-if it is large enough to be called such-that has the House of Commons, public opinion, and the whole English political press, daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly, against it, must, we presume, fall back upon the Gentlemnim's 2aga-ize for a vehicle of communication with the public. Mr. GLADsTom, has, at any rate, selected this patriarchal journal for an essay on " The " War and the Peace." He has actually had the heart to tear poor old SylZens from his ancient inscriptions, Runic rhymes, and Roman milestones, to figure before the public as a political oracle. The old gentleman has indeed come out of the classical Medean process which Mr. GLADSTOism has applied to him a young man again and a Parliamentary spokesman; but the strange galvanic life hardly suits or becomes him, and the article on " Scandinavian Wash-leather," which was ousted in order to make room for the essay on " War " and Peace," -would have harmonized much better with the general scope of the journal and imparted a more solid dignity to the number than this pitfall plunge into the vulgar present and the politics of the prosaic living world. The general aim of Mr. GLA.DsToi-i's essay is to show how much deeper the " Peeite" wvar policy wvas than that vhich actually prevailed in Parliament and in English public opinion. To be sure, the war has been brought to a successfLl issue; that he cannot deny. He even attempts to gain credit for the Peelite section of the Cabinet for the original plan of invading the Criinea. " The great historical interest," he says, " which " must always attach to the invasion of the Crimea "has induced us thus briefly to discuss the ques"tion wvhetlher the chief autthors of if' (wve presume the Peelites) " deserve, on that score, the approval " or displeasure of their country." But, successful as the issue of the war has been, it would have been much more satisfactory if the means employed to gain this end had been more scientific and more in accordance with the deep and refined " Peelite" idea. The Peelite policy was to be satisfied with the basis of the Four Points, as laid down atthe Conferences of Vienna in the spring of 1855. But this was not enough for the coarse English mind, which had embraced the gross wish to take Sebastopol, and would be satisfied with nothing short. " We had already got our Helen; we had extorted from Russia at the sword's point the acceptance of the four base5 which expressed the demands of Europe upon the refractory empire . But the manifestation of feeling by popular England during the negotiations abundantly convinced diplomatic, or at least Ministerial England, that he who would be X inister must not upon any terms retire from before Sebastopol. Lord John, to his honour, recommended acceptance of the terms; but the rest of the Government, more adroitly guided, though they had originaly determined not to make the surrender of Sebastopol a sine pa non of peace, now trimmed their sails to the prevailing wind."1 Alas ! the " Peelite" policy was too refined for the coarse, valgar taste, of the British nation, which, like every barbarous and unenlightened section of mankind, has that rude desire to succeed in the thing it attempts, and when a place has been laid siege to to take it. This was, doubtless, a gross blunder on scientific principles, and we were bound to leave off the warwhenwe couldsecure the Four Points. Yet it may be doubted whether that coarse English sentiment did not, after all, contain a good deal of true common sense, and whetlher the recondite "Peelite" idea of "retiring from "before Sebastopol' would not practically have left us the worse off in position and prestige for the war, and the Russians much better off. We ought perhaps to have been satisfied even with this conclusion, if proved to be the proper offshoot of diplomatic science, and we ought to have esteemed it a privilege to be beaten upon mathematical principles and by such a refined and correct process as that of the " Peelite' policy. Yet the coarse appetite for success has, after all, something to say for itself, and the patient is apt to think it a poor consolation, when he has to die, that he dies upon the most orthodox principles and by the correctest rules of medicine. The writer of the article on "Peace and War' does not think that we have been too successful as it is; he rather takes pains to show how little we have got by the issue of the war, and triumphs in the still boundless and indomitable resources, as he thinlks them, of the Russian empire. " The war has repelled Russian aggression for the time, but. . . . it does not offer us a permanent and sufficient security. It has gained us breathing time, and breathing time may be all-importan." Well, but if with wore than sufficient success, as Mr. Gx.UDSTrNoX thinks we have got by the capture of Sebastopol, over and above the Four Points,-if even with this superfluity of success we have only gained "breathing time," surely we should not have been particularly well off without the capture of Sebastopol, and w-ith the Four Points only. And Mfr. GAnSTONXi'S general theory of belligerent ends is as little eiatisfactory as his theory of belligerent means. " It must be observed," he says, " that there is a mode7n fashion of eati"mating the wants of armies which not only "exceeds all former precedents, but which, if "c seriously put to the test of practice, bids fair to "render extended military operations in mo0t "countries impraeticable." The censure of the "modexn fashion of :eatimatiig t'he wants of "arimies" conesa miitably enough-from a astates.- man who intended to provide for the war o6ut of the income of the yesr. But we trust that thi British statesmen who may have to conduct our future wars will, instead of complaining of the "wants of armies," endeavour properly to supply them.
It is not very usual vwith us to discuss theatrical matters in a portion of ou r columnns devoted to graver subjects, nor should. we now violate our ordinary rnle but that a grave question of public morality is involved in one which is at first sight but a matter of dramatic propriety. WVe are no puritans on such points, and are perfectly willing to concede a large measure of license to the stage. It is obvious enough. that in the Greek tragedians, in Sliaklsieare, in GoetJe, in Aotieri-ay, even in Calderon and Corneille, there are to be found terrible examples of the aberrations of human passion. The murder of her husband, by BHsxxxf's mother and her subsequent union with -the brother of her murdered husband are not very edifying proceedings. The unconscious incest of (EDiPus with JocAsTA constitutes a tale which one would not willingly put into the hands of a young and uncontaminated girL The commoon sense of mankind, however, has long since determined that no evil can arise to morality from the manner in which these subjects are handled by the great masters of tragic emotion. Human nature may be stirred to its depths by the spectacle of such wickedness and euch grief, but the passions are purified, not roused into morbid action, by the display. There is a wide step from these representations to the impersonation of all that is most foul and hideous in human nature, and its exhibition upon the stage -with all the alluring additions of scenery and song. To come to the point, for some months past an opera bearing the name of La Trariata has been represented at Mmxn MAJZ_sr's Theatre, which, from its subject, should never have been exhibited on any stage. This opera is founded upon a tale as profoundly immoral as itself, called la Dame eaur Ca?nmeias, which was published not very long since in Paris. The subject is this :-A courtesan, unfortunate even among hler unfortuate sisterhood, plies her miserable trade with pre-eminent success, so singular are her charms and the fascination of her manner. At last, in the midst of her mercenary engagements, she herself conceives a passion for a young man, the hero of the book,-but she is afflicted with consumption. The excitement of the tale depends upon the play of passion between the two lovers-upon his jealousy, upon her devotion, checkered with relapses, while at the same time the dreadful disease which is to cut her existence short is every day aggravated by the throes and convulsions of her passion. She dies at last, and all the horrors of her death-agony are as minutely described in the novel as they are vividly represented upon the lyric stage. It is as unnecessary as it would be disgusting to enter here into minute particulars. Suffice it to say that all the interest is concentrated upon the death-struggles of this wretched girl. It is for her that pity is asked, and it is to her that pity is given. She is the erring, btit repentant sinner--the heroine for whom our sympathies are aroused. The novel is the apotheosis of prostitution, and upon the stage is practically added a clinical lecture upon consumption in its direst form. Now, we say that, morally speaking, this is most, hideous and abominable. If the novel or the opera be regaraed merely from the artistic point of view, each is founded upon essentially -wrong principles. It is a violation of the most obvious principles of taste and of the commonest inspirations of human feeling to exhibit mere disease upon the stage, or to rake up the dunghills of vice for the purpose of introducing us to the sons and daughters of obscenity. A vriter who signs himself " Aw AcORo, BUT NOT A SPEcTATOR," has addressed a letter to us upon this subject, which 'will be found in another portion of our columns this day. Although his object is to urge extenuating circumstances in palliation of the disgusting exhibition, the force of truth is so great that the writer commences by admitting " that it "was wrong to make a courtesan the interesting "heroine of a drama, and it was wrong of VEBDi "to choose such a subject for an opera." We talke note of the admission, and now for the points which can be urged in paliation of this great public scandal. Our correspondent triumphantly asks have we never heard of LAtcrezia Borgia, of Don Giovannli, of Bigoletto ? Of the last mentioned wvork we have nothing to say, never, in truth, having attended its representation; but if what the writer remarks of it be true we can only say that we are very sorry for it, and ara dealing with two abominations in place of one. To the instances of the Litcrtcia Borgia and of Don Giovanni we attach little importance, for certainly neither the spectacle of the poisoned l)?2sSALINA of medikeval Italy, nor of the perdition of the heartless seducer, is very likely to invite imitation, or to excite the pruriency of passion. LucRmaLk BoxGiA, besides, is an historical, as Don Ju-kw is a traditional character. Although we could have 'wished that both MIozART and his brilliant successor had chosen theraes less open to misconstruction, there is an enormous difference between their results and that at which VERDI, under the auspices of DuoAs the younger, has arrived. Lucszr,A BoRG.A and Don JuAN's victimrs were not at any rate paid strumpets, but by the younger artist attention is called to the brothels and abominations of modem Paris-of the Boulevards as they exist in the year 1856. It is all very well for our correspondent to assert that " the wretched "libretWo"-this is his own expression-is " but "an entangled travesty of the original story." This maybe true enough, but the one calls attention to the other, and even in itself, wvretched as the libretto undoubtedly is, it contains a tale which never should have been exliibited on any stage, or in the presence of decent womanhood. The last plea is that people go to the Opera not for the libretto, but for the music. If this be so, is it not a thousand times better to fall back upon an imitation of the trivialities of M3rAsTAsio than to outrage public feeling bythe public representation of prostitution? We meet the plea, however, with a direct denial. The interest derived from an exciting libretto adds greatly to the fortunes of an opera, and in few so much as in the case of the Travita. The music is most commonplace; it is the libretto and the acting which "draw." Now, if Jach 7Sheppard at the Adelphi made thieves, 'what are the suggestions to be derived -from the representation of La Traviata at Byan M&rEsr's Theatre in the Haymarket ? The subject is a most painful and a most dis- agreeable one. It is not the noveist and tne 1 composer, nor the manager, nor the actors,who are solely to blame. Deep anda unutigated censure should be the porLion of an audience Who could sit out such a spectacle, especially when that audience is for the most part composed of women. Surely, in order to entertain an English lady it is not necessary to take her for a saunter in the Haymarket at midnight, and to conduct her about 4 a.m. t, the consumptive ward of an hospital that she may aee a prostitute finish her career. A littlemore, and we shall have the obsceni- ties of XAvnwn 3*31o=rO in full voge upon. the English stage and in the hands of Englsh rexderj, and really -this is not desirable, eitheT from an I'atistic or a umoral pontD of view. We warn the ladies of England to taLe heed in this matter. Their own interests are most deeply involved in the decision of the question whether or not their lusabads sad sons shall be inoculated with the worst types of PariViau vice. If the process be sanctioned by their approval, there can be little doubt that the lesson taught in one place will be practised in another.

It was state! in court that the privato examintion ofEJames Sadluir hald been muchdisapprovedof, and the Court was pleased to add that it was sume I now regretted that sach examination had taken place. "It is to be e6bservad that none of the parties before the Cowt complained that James Sadleir had beem privately examused. They couldnot, because he was so examined at the direct instaince and request off the official manager and his solicitor, and with the full knowledge and concurrence of Messrs. Gibs:a and Adair, who had been appointed solicitors to the proceedings, and also of the eminent English solicitor -who represented the great massof the English alleged shareholdersn ' It was known that James Sadleir had in his poshession a most important deed, executed in the early part of the year 1855, by which John Sadleir had aRreed to convey his irish estates to trustees to ceive the very large balanoe then due by himl to the Tipperary aulr, and which deed was not then registerea, and of ivhich no copy c6uld. be procured. It Mas further knovn to us that he had in his possession and 'vithin his knowledge other documents and information cornected with.Tohn Sadleir and his own sub. sequent transactions with certain English banks, which WaS all important fcr us to be furnished with. It was also ascertained that he lad been recommended by one of his rofeusonal advisess to leave the country at once, and there was some reason to fear that he vould not submit himself to any examination. "The official manager and his solicitor 'were appointed on the 17th of hiar:h. On the same day they attended in chain. ber and represented the importance of M1. Sadleir being immediately exianined, under the foregoing ' cumstces, It was then suggested to me, Uostt properly, that the proceedings in this esse were analogous to those in banruptcy, in which, at the instance of the asignee, private examinations are constaetly had. Attheir instance, and upon full consideration, I assented to the private examination. I felt, and sostated at the time, thatlwas aware that in doingso Iwould subject myself to misrepresentation, but +ht it was my duty to disregardl, as I hope I alway s shall, any such consideration when thereal interest of any suitors of the court reouires it. 'A t sssprenaawas immediately issued, accompanied by an intimation from the solicitor that the examination would be private. " hr. Sadleiraceordingly attended on the 19th of Marchw flisperson even .vas then unknown to me. I never had any previous communication -with him directly or indirectly, and I saw him then forthe first time. "His examination occupied about five hours; it related to the matters above referred to. It had nothing whatever to do with the frauds afterwards ia quetion; and the dutv of cauitioning him, in case be was about to state anything which could subject him to criminal or other proceedings, 'was, as the Courb justly observed it ought to have been, always present to 3my mind; but it did not become necessary to act on it. "The examination resultedinJames Sadleirshandiag over tothe offlicialimanager the deed above referred to, adgiving otherusefulinformation. I should .dso add tLathe confirmed what we had heard, that he had been advised to leave the country; and he further stated that, from the manner he had been dealt with, he had given tentimes theinformation which could have been wurng from him by a public examination, and that he would now remain and give any further assistance and information in his power to the official manager towards the realization of the assets. 'I am therefore satisfied that this private examination was bondifidc, prudent, and useful, and that it would have been a weak and unworthy abandonment of my plain duty not to bave acceded to it. For these reasons Icannot and do. not regret it. "' 2. It has been also stated in court that the public were at a loss to understand the grounds upon which lexonerated James Sadleir from the frauds relating to the issue of the English shares, and it has been stated elsewhere that I acquitted James Sadleir and the other parties sought to be implicated. Y did not exonerate nor did I acquit James Sadleir; the case, as it camo Defore me, was, in fact, a case between the admitted and what have been calledinnocent shareholders and the alleged English shareholders. " To enable the latter to make their case their olicitors were af'orded inspection of every book and document, and ample time, and they had the ablest professional assistance. '"In not one lino of their .idavits produced before me did they o:ege that James Sadleir had been a party to the fraud. "When the matter subsequently came on appeal before the Master of the 31o01s this difficulty was felt; and in the exercise of the discretion which the law allows he permitted a further affidavit to be made. "This affidavit, which was sworn on the Gth of June, charges, on the belief of deponent, fraudulent concert and combination on the part of John and James Sadleir, as the managing director of the bank, ana concludes in these words :-' And deponent says that, if he had been as fuUl informed of the facts and circumstances of this transactiors when he made his former affidavit as he is now, he would have stated the belief therein expressed in his former affidavit.' " It was contended before me, on behalf of the official manager-lst. That no fraud on the part of James Sadleir had been alleged. ia. That ithad not been proved "UJpon a most careful consideration of this point of the case I arrived at tho conclusion (which I still consider to be correct) that althouigh there were against James Sadleir strong grounds for suspicion, there was not before me sudiicient legal evidence to sustain the charge, andI accordingly find that the terms of my original judgment, which is nowv before me, and from wvhich I copy thenm-- " 'On this point I am of opinion that, as b;etwveen the alleged and admitted contribvtories, the fraud, as imputed to James Sadleir, has not been suficiently esablished by strict legal proof so as to form a ground for legal decision.' "And ia the next passage I state- "'I decide the question before me independently of this point, to which I, however, consider it my duty to aavert.' "I uIsed these last words, as I observed at the time, in order that the parties might have it in their power to lay further evidence before the Master of the Rolls, "I should hero state that I have been informed by counsel that the case before the Master of the bolls assumed a very different aspect from that in which it was presented to me, and -that, moreover, the letter of John Sadleir, of December, 1855, was not discovered until Jume last, when, wvithout ever having read or even seen it, I directed it to be handed to bis Honour. My duty was merely ministerial-to decide the question between the parties ' pon the case and evidence adduced before me. Nothinog was further from my intention than to exonerate or acquit James Sadleir, and I consider it, with &al respect, to be a mistake to say that I did so. The ground upon Nvhich I conceived that the English shareholders had not made out their case, so far as it depended on the question of fraud, was insufficiency of strict legal proof, and this I endeavoured to state with what appeared to me sufficient precision.

VDowel, the official manager of the Tipperary Bank, w'ho was appointed by the Lord Chancellor receiver over the estate of Janmes Sadleir, in the case of " O'Flaherty petitioner, James Sadlleir respondent," has perfected his security, the amount being 3,7001. The Tipperary Free PrCSS of yesterday states that Clonacooty, the residence of James Sadleir, near Fethard, has been very recently visited by the authorities, wvho, on one occasion, were said to have been close upon the trail of the fugitive. The Free Press also states thatthe rumour of James (and even John) Sadleir being still in Ireland is daily gaining ground and becoming-raore generally credited. nlFAEIT IFLADE BRETUXS The Belfast Xermaaztile Journai publishles the trade returns of tlat port for the last half-year.

.BIETISH ASS'O lAZroY FOR THE ADVANTCE- MEN(T OF SCIENCE. CHELTENHAM, ArG. 6. Tho 26th annual meeting of this eminent body camnenced its sittiDgs this day at Cheltcisham, tnder the preuliency of Dr. Daubeny, .RRS. The meeting promises to ho one of the most successful mud interesting of any which tho assoiaztion las yet held, and it is indeed gratifying to fnd that every year brings with it an increased amount of ntrest in connexion with the objects anud movements of tho association. The directors of Cheltenham College have y1aced that building at the disposal of the officers of the D -oc ation, and the most active prenarations have, fcr some days past, been made to render the different schoolrooms saitable for the sittings of the various sections. The two largest of these rooms have been assigned to tnh Geological and Geographical Sections. Both these rooms have been lighted with gas, it being intended that the inaugaral meeting and the eveninglectures of Colonel Sir H. Rawlinson and Mr. Grove shaU be held there. Chelteaham College is admirably adapted for the purposes of the association, and the various class-rooms have been moat judiciously arranged and elegantly decorated under the direction of M1r. uIlgall, one of the local secretaries. The Duke and Duchess of Argyll arrived at Cheltenham this morning, and, although there is a large attendance of members of the association and a considerable influx of visitors, there is no lack of accommodation in the town, owing to the absence of so many of the residents, and the lodgings are better and cheaper than at any place the society has previously visited. The following are among the number of arrivals -Earl of Elleaborough, Earl Ducie, Sir I. J. Miurchison, Lord Wrottesley. Lord Stanley, Sir J. Kay Shuttlewortl, Sir H. Rawlinson, Professor J. D. Thomas, Dr. M'Adam, Mr. J. E. Appold, Dr. W. Gladstone, Mr. H. C. Sorhy, Professor Corbett, Professor Eamsey, ir. J. P. Gassiott, Professor Harkness, Dr. N. Shlhw, AIr. J. T. Dawson. Dr. W. N. Hancock, btr. IL Cull, P?rofessor Steveley, Dr. Lanlkester, Dr. Booth, Dr. lee, Dr. l)aubeny, Professor Sedgwrick, Professor Lloyd, Mr. T. Tooke, Dr. Anderson, Colonel Yorke, Mr. Tite, M.P., Professor Phillips, Mr. J. Yates, &c. The proceedings of the association commenced this morning by a meeting of the general committee in the College at 1 o'dclck, Dr. Daubeny in the chair.- Professor Pssnss, the assistant general secretary, read the minutes of the previous meetings..and the report of the eouwncil of the association, which was ordered to be printed. - Mr. J. P. GAsloS61 moved that the cordi.al thanks of the General Committee of the British Association be offered to Lord Wrottesley and the officers and council of the Royal Society, for the promptitude vwith which they have responded to the request of the Committee of the British Association, in granting the sum of 250' for the purpose of lighting the Newr Observatory with ga2s. The motion, havingl been seconded by MWr. J. T.AyLOR, was cried unanimously. Lord Wsorrrsrxy, on behalf of himself and the officers and council of the Royal Society, aclmowledged the vote of thanks.

R.WEMsU road the report of the Parliamentary Committee to the meeting cf the British As-ociation, which vwas as foUovws:- "'We have the pleasure of announcing that one&very in portant subject to which our laboura have been directed has bematriaUy advanced since the date of ourlastreport; we allude to the junta-position of the scientifi societies of Londonin a convenient and eentral locality. The main building at Burlington-house has been placed by the Go-vernment at the disposal of the Royal Society, on the understanding that they accommodate the Linnean and Chymical Societies, with rooms therein; and the west wing wil be converted into a capacious haLl, which is to be occupied by the Royal Society at aU times when it is not required for the -examinations and public meetings of the University of London. We truSt that the period is not far distant in which permanent accommodation will be afforded to all the principal scientific societies in buildings to be erected near the same site, and in pursuance of some general plan. Your committee, however, anticipate most important advantazes to science from the present partial adoption by the Government of the principle of junta-position; and our chairman has, in his address to tne Royal Society, on the occasion of their last anniversary, alluded to the benefits likely to accrue from this salutary measure. In the same address also will be found a summary of our labours since -our complete organization in 1851, a perusal of which will show to what extent the proceedings of our committee have jusified the anticipations of thoso who promoted its formation. During the past year two subjects have been referred to us., viz.,-firat, the question of the expenses incurred by scientific institutions not inrcorated in appoint-lug new trustees of thear property when vacanses occur; and, secondly, we were requested by your council, in January last, to support an application to Parliament an reference to lighting ow Observatory w;ith gas, when made by the Chief Commissioner of Woods. The first subject above adverted to has been considered by us, and we shall resume its discussion when an opportunity offers for remedying the evil. With respect to the second, we mnst refer to the report of the Kew Committee for an explanation of the reasons which have made it impossible for us to render that species of assistance which was con- emplated at the time when the reference was made to us. !fhe moat important eubject of our last report-viz., the Iluestion ' Whether any measures could be adopted by the 'Government or Parliament that would improve the position of science or its cultivators? has since its discussion at Glasgow been again considered by us, and durine the last session of Parliament it was brought before the house of - Commons by Mr. Heywood, as an individual member of the House, and not as representing your committee. The discussion of our report by the Committee of Recoinmnendations at Glasgow in September last, the result of the debate which took place in the House of Commons on the occasion last referred to, and subsequent communications with members of the LegIslature, have combined to convince us-lst., that men of scienco have as yet formed no definite opinion on the important auestion raised in the report; and, 2dly, that, until such a kIsaut be attained, it is improhable that any important improvement will bie effected in the position of ScienCe or its cultivators either through the agency of the Govern- ment or Parliament. It is desirable, therefore, that some measures should be adop ted which may be instrumental in induncing scion cty. men genery to apply their minds to the consideration of these questions, and to agree upon some definite proposas. We, therefore, recommend that the subject should be agai brought before the Committsee of Recommendations. Meanwhile the General Comnittee wille gratified on learning that the importance of the question has been recog-aized by the Council of the Royal Society, who havereferred its consideration to the Government Grant Committee. That committee have appointed a sub-committee, consisting of the President and officers of the Royal Society and seven other members, who will meet on the 7th of October for the purpose of discussing the subject prior to the reassembling of the society after the recess. Your committee recommend for the consideration of the General Committee, whether it would be expedient to relax the rule by which vacancies in our committee must be filed up exclusively from mem- bers of the British Association, so far as to admit members of either Hoouse of Parliament who have advanced the interests of science. Your committee also recomnmend that two vacancies in our body, caused by the non-attendance of the Earl Catlscart and Sir J3V. B. Jobsstoe, arb doingtwo consecutive yeas efldb the election of the Bail of Burlington ear, be filledby Mlember of Parliament for in and ord Stnley, " WRa T}EZ , Chairman," A vote of thanks having been given on the motion of Sir X. J. MuRcnSsos to Lord WrotteaIey and the members of the Parlamentar Committee for their unceasi:ng attetion to the interests of science in the Legislature, Lord WrromLEY, in acknowledging the compliment, stated that it was most desirable that the rule should be altered by which vacancies in the Parliamentary Committee were only allowed to be filled up by members of the associa tion, and concluded by a formal motion to tha' effect Professor PnmLiPs seconded the motion, which was adopted. On the motiorn of Lord WRoTor sa the Earl of Burlin5. ton and Lord Stanley were elected to fil the vacancies in the committe occasioned by the deaths of Earl Catheart and Sir John Johnstone.

The following letter. in explanation of a proposal to change the title of oine of the sections, addressed to the general secretarv by Mr. R. AL Milnes, hLP., D.C.L., president of the Statistical Section at Glasgow, 1855, was then readl by Professsor Pnillips:- " Dear General Satine,-At the last meeting of the British Association I gave notice of my intention to propose at the Cheltebhamn meeting, that the Section of 'Statistics'e hould in future be entitled the 'Section of Ecnoniic Sciience and Statistics.' ' I ai desirous that thiischange should beeffected. because I think it will bring the objects of the section more legitimately vithin the scope of the asociation. Political econoumy is nowv recmgenized as a science, not only by the establishmwent of chairs in the chief universities of Europe, bet£ also by the confirmation which experience has given to its principles anid deductionis. Atthesametime it is important that public attenti,on shou ld in. every way be attracted to its study at a timne when fits terminology, necessarily imnperfect froml the period of its formnation, Is undergoing considerable revi-ion, antd when the investigations, now in p ro. gress on the Continent and in the United States are subjectag the docstrines of the most distinguished British founders to a severe and often hostile sceatiny. "At the same time I do not wish to give up the word 'statistics.' because its retention enables the section usefuUy to entertain many subjects of general interest which the wholesoune abstinence of the association from olitical and moral questions must otherwise exclude. I bdieve the public has derived great advantage from the materials of social and economnical truths gatheredtogetherand presented at the meetings, and would see with regret any further limitation of its objects. " I shall be glad if the general committee of the association think fit to adopt the alteration which I Propose, and I remain, dear General Sabine, yours very sincarely, " Rsons MoNcTOsN MrsiIx "16, Upper Brook-street, July 16." After some conversation, the committee agreed to change the title of Section F from "Statistics" to "Economic Scieuce and Statistics," upon the motion of Mr. NEwIsAncHc, in the absence of Mr. PG M. Milnes. Mr. HOLLAND, dl P., on behalf of the inhabitants of Cirencester, invited the association to visit and examine the Roman remains in and near that town and also the Museum and Agricultural Coilege on Saturday next. The invitation was accepted, and the thanks of the committee were given to Mr. Holland and the inhabitants of Cirencester. The meeting then broke up, having sat one hour. THE PRESIDENT'S OPENNG ADDIES. S Dr. DAVnBers, the President, deliveredthe usual opening address, taking for his subject "The Progress of Physical Science within the last 20 years." After some introductory observations, the learned president commenced his review with the science of chymustry, the subject with which, he said, he was most familiar. He first reminded his auditory that at a period not much more remote than the date at which that association sat in the city of Bristol, 20 years ago, aU that could be quoted as really worthy the name of ,chymical science was comprehended within the limits of 'the mineral kingdom *- "There was a world almost as little k-nown to the chymists of that pceried as was the Western Hemisphere to the Macedonian Conqueror-a world comprising an infinite variety of important products, called into existence by the mysterious operation of the vital principle, and therefore* placed, as was imuagined, almost beyond the reach of experimental research. 'This was the new wrorld of chymistry, which the continental philosophers inthe iirst instance and subsequently those of our own country, had, during the last 20 years, been bhesy in exploring, and by so doing had not ony bridged over the gulf which had before separated by an impassable barrier the kingdoms of inorganic and of oranic nature, but also added provinces as extensive and as fertile as those we were in posssession of before to the patrimony of science .......... . And as the New World might never have been discovered, or, at al events, would not have been brought under our subjection, without those improvements in naval architecture wbich had taken place prior to the age of Columbus, so the secrets of organic chyinstry would have long remained unelicited but for the facilities in the methods of analysis which were introduced by Liebig. Before his time the determination of the component elements of an organic substance was a task of so much skil at well as labour tnat only the most accomplished analysts-such men, forinstance, as his lamented friend Dr. Prout in this country, or as the great Berzelius in Swveden-could be depended upon for such a work; and hence the data upon winch we could rely for deducing any general conclusions went on accumulating with extreme slowness. But the new methods of analysis invented by Liebig have so simplified and so facilitated the processes that a student after a few months' practical instruction in a iaboratory, can, in many instances, arrive at results sufficiently precise to be made the basis of calculation, and thus to enable the master mind, which is capable of availing itself of the facts before it, to breathe life into these dry numerical details-just as the sculptor, by a few finishing strokes, brings out the expression of the statue which has been prepared for him by the laborious chiselling of a number of subordinate worlken. . Formerly it had been the rule to set down the bodies which form the constituents of the substances we analyzed, and which had never yet under our hands undergone decomposition, as elementary, but the discovery of cyanogen in the first instance, and the recognitionof severalother compound radicals in organic chymistry more lately, naturally suggest the idea that many of the se-called elements of inorganic m.atter may likewise be compounds, differing from the organic radicals abeve mentioned merely in their constituents being bound together by a closer affinity. It is curious to reflect that while the hold speculationls of Democritus had been realized by the Manchester philosopher, the reveries of the alchemists derive something like solid support from the minute investigations of his successors. Indeed, it is not a little remarkable how frequently the discoveries of modern days have served to redeem the fancies of medieval times from the charge of absurdity. If the direction of a bit of steel suspended near the earth can, as General Sabine has proved, be influenced by the position of a body like the moon, situated at a distance from t of more than 200,000 miles, who shall say that there was anything preposterously extravagant in the conception, however little support it may derive from experience, that the stars might exert an influence over the destines of man?"' Passsing to the practical results bearing on the arts of life which have either been actually deduced, or might be anticlpated to accrne from chymical discovery, the president remarked:- "Of these, perhaps, the most important is the possibility of forming by art those compounds which had been formerly supposed to be only producible by natural processes, under the influence of the Vital principle. The last two years have added materialy to the catalogue of such bodies artificially produced, as in the formation of several specits of alchohol from coal gas by Berthelot, that of oil of mustard by the same chymist, and the generation of taurine, a principle elaborated in the liver by Strecker. And if the above discoveries should strike you at first sight rather as curious than practicaUy useful, I would remark that they afford reasonable ground for hope that the production of some of those principles of high medicinal or economical value which nature has sparingly provided, or at least limited to certain districts or climates, may lie within the compass of the chymist's skill. If quinine, for instance, to which the Peruvian bark owes its efficacy, be, as would appear from recenit researches, a modified condition of amosonia, why may not a Holmann be able to produce it for us from its elements, as he has already done so many other alkaloids of similar constitution ? And thus, while the progress of civilization and the development of the chymical arts are accelerating the consumption of those articles which kind nature has either been storing up for the uses of man during a vast succession of antecedent ages, or else is at present elaborating for us in that limited area within which alone the conditions would seem to be such as to admit of their production, we are encouraged to hope that science may make good the loss she has contributed to create, by hersel2 inventing artificial modes of obtaining these necessary maters In this case we need not so much regard the exhauston of our collieries, although nature appears to have provided no mean!s for replenishing them; nor even be concerned at the rapid destruction of the trees Which yield the Peravian bark, limited though they boe toa very narrow zone and to a certain definite elevation on either side of the equator. Already, indeed, chymistry has given token of her powers by threatening to alter the course of commerce, and to reverse the tide of human industry. Thus she has discovered, it is said, a substitute for the cochineal insect in a beautiful dye produrcible from guano. She has shown that onr supply of animal food might be obtained at a cheaper rate from the antipodes by simply boiling. down the juices of the flesh of cattle now wasted and thrown aside in those countries, and importing the extract in a state of concentration. She has pointea out that one of the earths which constitute the principal material of our globe contains a metal as lignt as glass, as malleable and ductile as copper, and as lltt'e liable to rust as silver; thus possessing properties so valuable that, when means have been found of separating it economically from its ore, it will be capable of supersedimg the metals in common use, and thus of rendering metallurgy an employment, not of certain districts only, but of every part of the earth to which science and civiiization have penetrated. And May I not also say that she has contributed materially towards the advancement of those arts in which An agriculfnal country like this is especially interested? It is not often that the same individual has reaped a high reputation at once by establishing general principles in science and by rendering ponular their application to practice.... But Baron tiebig stanlds equally distsnuished for his ingenuity in devising newv r.t.heds of anaTysis, for his origi- nalii tnhorpounding grat theoretical principles in science, and fo r nuhappPy. Ilent in applying these principles to pUrt-poe of prcia Utility.' Referring to the discuszions which have talken place for some time past between this diatingaiahed foreigner and certain experimental agaiculturistai England withregard to the principles that ought to regulate the manuring of lad, Dr. Daubeny proceeded:- "In so far as concerns Ishe relative advant en of mineral and &muoniacal manures, I presume there is ittle room. for controversy; for, although most soils may contain a sufficiency of the 3inorguac _ nistituents required by the crop, it by no maeans fovlows that the latter are always in an available condition; and hence it may well happen that in most cases in which land has been long under cultivation, the former class of manures becomes; as Baron Liebig asserts, amatter of paramnount necessity. Now, that the same necessity exists for the addition of amsoniacal manures can haardly be contended when we reflect that; at the first commencemenft of vegetable life, every existing species of plant must Shave obtained its nourishm6nt; solely f:om the Zaseous constituents of the atmosphere, and from the mineraw contents of the rock in whichit vegetatedA The only divergence of opinion, therefore, that can arise relates to the degree of their respective utility in the existing state of our agriculture, and to the soundness of Baron Liebig's nosition, that a plant rooted in a soil weU charged withall he requisite mineral ingredients, and in all other respects in a condition calculated to allow of healthy vegeta. tion, may sooner or Laterba able to draw from the atmosphere whatever else is required for its faU development. And does not, I would ask, this latter position derive some sapport from the luaxuriant vesgetation of the tropics, where art. certainly contr.butes nothimg towards the result 9 And is it not also favoured by such eLxperiments as those carriedA on a LoisWeedonin Northamptonshire, where the most luxuriant wheat crops have been obtained for a number of consecutive. years without manure of any Idnd, simply by following out the Tullian system of stirring up and pulverizing the soil ? How, too, are we to explain that capacity of subsisting. without any artificial supply of ammonia which Mr. Lawes is led bv his expesiments to attribute to turnips and other plants olf similar organization, unless we assume that tho power residing in the leaves of absorbing ammonia from tihe. air may resider' plants, in some cases -at least, independent of any extraneous aid?9 c. . atStili the practical question remLins whether, admitting the theoretical truth of Baron Liebig's position, a larger expern; diture of capital wil not be required for brmngcug a given farm into a condition to dispense with amnmoniaca manures than for procuring those materials which contain that ingredient ready for use. And here experimental researches, such as those conducted on so extended and liberal ascale by Mr. Lawes and Dr. Gilbert, come in aid of theory. They stand, as it were, midway between the abstract principles which science points out to the farmer and the traditional usages w.th respect to his art which have been handed. down to him from one generation to another. They bear the same relation to the farmer which the records of the clinical practice in a large infirmary do to the general principles of medicine expounded by the modern physiologist." rang awarded a meed of praise to the researches carried on in our own country, and especially those conducted under the auspices of the Highland Society by Dr. Anderson; at our own Agricultural College, by Professor Voeleker; and through the aid of the Royal Agricultural Society by their consulting chymist, Mr. Way, the President next approached the dsepartments of botany and vegetable physiology. In these branches of natural science he "It cannot, perhaps, be said that whole provinces have been added to the domain of the science since the period alluded to, as we have seen to be the case in our review of the p rogress of cbymnisthy. As long ago as the year 1832 the el der De Candolie who, if not the most original or the most profound of the botanists of his da>, was at least the most conspicuous for the wNide range of his information, and for his happy talent of inparting it to others, published that admirable work on vegetable physiology which, even at the present time, is capable of serving as a most useful guide in many branches of the subject. And yet what a mass of important information has been brought together since that period ! The improvements in the msioroscop,e which have since taken place render uLsfamfiliar withparticulars relating to the structure and functions of the vegetable creation which the ruder methods of investigation before resorted to would never have revealed to us. We owe to them the inte resting discoveries of Brov,n and Adolphe Brongniart as to the mode in which the pollen is brought into immediate contact with the ovuies, by means of the tubes which it protrudes by a prolongation of the innermost of its two investin- membranes. Whie the researc'Aes of Brown and others have showvn that there is no abrupt line of divisionin the vegetablekingdom, and that one common s ructure pervades the whole, the later inquiries of Suminskd, Hofrmeister, UJnger, Griffitb, and Heufre, have pointeed out several curious and unlookedfor analogies between plants and animals. I may mention in the first place, as an instance of this analogy between plants and animals, the existence of moving molecules or phytosperms in the Antheridia of ferns and other cryptogaxns, borne out as it has been in so remarkable a manner by the almost simultaneous observations of Bischoff and Meissner on the egg, confirmatory of those formerly announced by Barry aznd Newport, and by the researches orf ovule of plants. I may refer you also to a paper read at the last meeting of the association by Dr. Cohn, of Breslan who, in bringing this subject before the NEatural HRistor Section, addulced instances o:f a distinction of sexes w ^'hiobbe come under his observation in the lower Algies. In like manner a carious correspondence has been traced between the lower tribes of animils and plants in the circumstance of both being subjoct to the law of 'what is called alternate generation. To the elder De Candolle we are also indebted for some of our most Philosophical view;s with respect to the laws which regulate t e distribution of plants over the globe-viewvs which have been developed and extended, but by no means subverted, by the investigations of subsequent writers; among whom Sir Charles Lyell, in his Prinsciples of Gcology, and the younger De Candolle, a worthy inheritor of his father's reputation, in his recently published work on Botanical Geography, have especially signalized themselve,. Bnt it iS to ta.e late Professor EdwardForbes, and to Dr. Joseph Hooker, that we have principally to attribute the removal of those anomalies which threw a certain degree of doubt upon the principles laid down by De CandoLe in 1820, in his celebrated article on the Geography of Plan contained in the Dieeiotnmaire des Scences Naturcel7, where the derivation of each species from an individ?al, or a pair of individuals, created in one particular localty, was made the starting-point of all our inquirs. Geology, by pointing out the probabilityof the submergence of continents on the one haSd and the elevation of tracts of land on the other, enables us to explain the Gocarrence of the same plants in some islands or continents now wholly unconnected, and the existence of a distinct flora in others too isolated to obtain it under present circumstances from vwthout. . . . An inquiry has been carried on for the last 15 years under the auspices of and with the aid of funds supplied by this association, the results of which, it is but fair to say, by no means corroborate the reports that had been from time to time given us with respeot to the extreme longevity of certain seeds, exemplified, as it was said, inthe case of the mummy wheat and other somewhat dubious instances; inasmuch as they tend to showi that none of the seeds which were tested, although they had been placeduner themost favouricioabled rtifial, conditions that coulds be devisedbeeatnedw afthiertai perie f4 e ars;elmthat fa thipe larer nume hapdi lostm tergrminating poer inrs. asthReuse of thoen." ae ceto,en h oe o-l hving described some of the services rendered to botanical scienco by the late Professor Forbes, Dr. X. Hooker, and Dr. Thomson, the president continued:- "The Will which confines thd variations in the vegetable sthucture within a certain range, le nshe order of creation should be disturbed by the introduction of an indefinite number of intermediate forms, is apparently the same in its motive as that which brings hack the celestial luminaries to their original orbits after the completion of a cycle of changes induced by their mutual perturbations- it is the same winch says to the ocean, 'thus far shalt ii;ou go, and no further;'I and to the winds- 'your violence, however apparently capricious and abnormal, shal nevertheless be constrained within certain prescihbed limits'- :Ni faciat, maria et termas cmlumque profandum (Tuippe fernt rapidi lcum, verrantquo per auras.' The law, inaeed, seems to be nothing else than a direct consequence of that unity of design pervading the universe, which soo esp a ommon Creator-of the existence in the mindf th etof asort of archetype to which His varioma works have all to a certain extent been accommodated ; so that the earlier forms of Iffe may he regarded as types of those of later creation, and. the more coaple~x ones nut as developments of rudimentary parts existing in the more aim pIc. Hero, too, we may perhaps trace an analogv -with His dealings with mankind, as unfolded in Hlis revealed word ; from which we find that the earlier events recorded are often typica of those more modern, and that Christianity itself is n some sense a development of the Jewish dispensation which preceeded it." Turning his attention next to geology, Dr. Daubeny said,- "This science has duringm the last 20 year made such rapid strides that these wiseo endeavoured from an early period of life to follow at a humble distance the footsteps of te greatleadersans that science obeying the impulse of such ze-alous and ardent spirits as the one now, alas! by the inscrutable decrees of Providence, lost to his friends and to ciece,wh costiutd te hadof what was once lute a new and, to them, an almost unkn own reglon.- Thu the thorough exploration which has taken place of the Silurian and Camabrian systems, through the exertions of two of our oldest and most valued associates, has added a new province-ought I not rather to say, a new kingdom I -to the domain of geology, and has carried bsck the recor-ds of the creation to a period previously as much unknown to us as were the annals of the Assyrian dynasties before the discoveries of Sir Henr liawlinson."1 Among the principles recently regarded as axioms in geology none seemed so hittle likely to be disputedas this~ "That the classes of animals an?'vecgetables wich ps .sessed the mnost comnpliceted structure -were precededby othners of amoresipmple one - and tl'at when we tracedl back, the succssion of beings to t?e lowest and the earliest of the sedimentary formations, we arrived at length at a clAss of rocks the deposition of which must bea inferred, from the almost entire absence of organic remnains, to have followed very soon after the first dawnof cretion.

The important underWtaing set on foot in connbxion with this department of knowleage, andI the intereting discoveris nade in it arios -the list ineeting of the asociation, weerre thus briofly Ienmnerted: "L Dr. Kane has exteudad?l Arct'i discover throg Smith Strait,:at the bead of Baffin's BAy,to bout three degrees nearer the i'oIe. 2.

Whent Humboldt directed attention to this region 50 years since he bad only uncertain reports to guide his anticipations; aud these surves have bEien the first to throw actual light Wunon this region. 3. Au expedition has been despatched to N~orth Australia, for the purpose of exploringg the interior and tracing the extent of the northern watershed. Its nrrival at the month of the Victoria River has been announced. 4. It is proposed by the Geographical Society to despattch an expedition to Easter Africa, to explore the extent of the inland waters known to exist tbere, and if nossible to discover the long-songht sources of the Nile. 5. The explorations in the Rocky ountains,by several parties in South A merica, in the Pacific, and elsewhere, are far too numerous to be further alluded to." The president then referred to the change which the sentiments of the public have undergone in relation to the claims-of physical science-a change, he observed, that afforded equal ground for congratulation with the actual progress mnade mu those 1ursuits. It was gratifying to tnc that the attention of the Legislature had at length beent seriously called to the consideration of what measures of a public nature might ba adopted for improvng theposition of science and its cultivators. The Royal Socet hadap pointed a body of its members to receive suggestions on that subject, and to report upon it, in order that a matu plan tomeet thisobjectmightbe presented toParliament atits next session. He also cited the School of Mines, the Ipswich Museum, the Oxford Museum, the growing interest talcels in the proceedings of that association, together with the in. creasig recognition of the importance of science in the eduacat-ion of youth, as gratifying signsof'advanoesment. He looled forward, he said, with confidence to the day when the requirements at Oxford ia the department of physical science would become so general and io. pressing that .no instutitn wuich professed to prepare the ybuth'it instructed for academicalcompetition -would venture to risk its reputation by deoliing to admit those branches of study into its educational corrses. --Having eloquently combatted the pie. judice entertained against scientific studies on the ground that they are inimical to revealed religion, Dr. Daubeny concluded as follows:- " We are told that in a future and a highar state of existence the chief occupation of the blessed is that of praising andworshipping the Almighty. Butis not the contemolation of the works of the Creator, and the study of the ordinances of the GreatLawgiver of the universe, in itself an act of praise and adoration: and, if so, may not one at least of the sources of happiness which we ara promised in a fruture state of existance, one of the rewvards for a single-minded and reverential pursnuit after truth in our present state of trial, consist in a development of our faculties, and in the power of comprehending those laws and provisions of nature with which our finite reason does not enable us at present to become cognizant? Such are a few of the reflections which the study of physical science, cultivated in a right spirit, naturay suggests; and I ask you whether they are not more calculated to inspire humility than to induce conceit-to render us more deeply conscious how much of the vast field of knowledge must ever lie concealed from our view, how small a porhion of the veil of Isis it is given us toliftup -and therefore to dispose us to accept, with a more unhesitating faith, the know;ledge vouchsafed fom on high on subjects which our owvn unassisted reason is incapable of fathoming. 'Let us not then,' to use the words of allyingprelate 'thinkr scorn of the pleasant land. That land is the ield of ancient and modern literature, of philosophy in almost all its branches, of the arts of reasoning and persuasion. Every part of it may be cultivated with advantage, as the land of an when bestowed ipon God's peculiar people. They were not commanded to letitlie waste, as incurblypolluted by the abominations of its first inhabitants; but to cultivate it and dwell in it, living in obedience to the Divine law, andi dedicating its choicest fruits to the Lord, their God."' At a meeting of the Manchester Town-Council, held yesterday, it was agreed to repeat the invitation given to the British Association, a few years ago, to visit that city. The intention is to invite the association to hold its meeting in 1857 at Manchester, and a committee of the towncouncil was nominated for that purpose. The opportunity is understood to be favourable, because it has transpirea that at Dublin the magnificent hall in Trinity College, where the association were to meet in 1857 if they accepted the invitation from that city, wiU not be completed in time. This being the case, it will probably be more convenient to Dublin to postpone its claim, and as the exibition of art treasures at Manchester will then be open, the meeting there would afford the members of the British Association a favourable opportunity of visiting this collection of works of art at the same time. The literary and other societies of Manchester will join in the invitation.
RAruvAy COLMiSioN.-An accident, which caused serious injuries to several persons, but fortunately no loss of life, occurred about 2 oc ock yesterday afternoon, at the Albion station, Son the Stour Valley branch of the London and North-Western 1ailvway, near Birmingham, At the hour named, the third-class train from Liverpool ran into a goods train, and a fearful col3ision was the consequence. How the two trains were on the same line of rail or to whom the blame of the accident in broad daylight is to be attributed, are matters for frture investigation. The shock is described as beimn fearful. The passengers were forcibly thrown against eace other, and many suffered considerable personal injury. One lady had her legbroken, and from 25 to 30 of the humbler class of passengers, who usually travel by the cheap train, received violent contusions of the head, face, leg-, &c. As soon as the occurrence became known,Z r.Cooper,theactivesuperintendent of the Newstree' station, Birmingham, repaired to the spot, and rendered every possible assistance. The passengers most injured-about eight or nine in number-remained at Old. bury and the neighbourhood, while those able to travel were taken forward to Birningham. They were chiefly Irnsh reapers ontheir wayto the harvest in the midland counties. A t the Birminugham station MrL COOper provided themr with the necessary surgical attendance, Jlodgings for those who were disbled, and, to those capable or willing to proceed on their Journey, gratis railway conveyance w,as afforded totheonearest stations to their places of destination, Cousiderable damage was done to the engines and railway carriages of both trains. NEW atacey AoT.-The last act of the late session, 39th and 20th of Victoria, chap. 120, was to facilitate leases and sales of settled estates. The object of the act is to give the Court of C'nancery power, in certain cases, to authorize leases and sales of settled estates where it is deemed that such leases or sales would be proper and consistent with a due reeard for the interest ofall parties entitled under the settlement, which term is to mean acts of Parliament, deeds, &c. Further, the act is to empowerpersons in possession of land for certain limited interests to grant agricultural or occnpation leases thereof at rack-rent tor a asonable peniod. There are 46 sections in the act, whichwillcome into operation on the 1st of Nlovember next THE WTAi I1L&iNL,.-The idea of a war with England! Men in the country read about it, and, as in the columns of the newspapers, taLked about it - but the columns of the newspapers were the only ones that moved on the occasion. We were, in all the length and breadth of New York, like unto the party who buried Sir John Moore-" Not a drum was heard.' Over 200,000 or 350,000 of citizen soldiery never provided a cartridge. The fashionable and worthy gentlemen who are the aids to the Commander-in-Chief were not sent with any order. The Military Secretary never thought of his duties, and Inspector-General Bruce and Adjutant-General Proyn took no unusual cares upon themselves. The great State of the Union never swerveda hair'sbreadthfromitheline of active business because Marcy and Palmerston were flourishing the small sword of diplomacy in the air. Our peoule knew that there was no cause of war. Intelligently tSey knew that. They knew of public affairs just as accurately as did the men who kept the portfolios of the State, and hence the calm. The incident illustrates the difference in the people of the two countries. We are wont to speak of England as a nation whose people are one with us. It is not accurately so. We are one with their few-not their many. The Coommons of the empire reveal in debate and in interrogatory the intention and information of the rulers. It would have puzzled Mr. Buchanan or Mr. Marcy to reveal the vecand qUeStiOn to our peeoplo in any light in which it had not long before appeare to them. In our country few, people study, but almost every one Teads, and the newspaper is the book. The history of this century wvouldlose one of its meat ex;traordinary featuires if the record of this occurrence were not noted. In that Legislature, where undoubtedly are gathered more learned meu carefully prepared for their duties by education, by study of history, and by all that hereditary wealth and unequalled sohools could accomplish, the question of a war with the United States was the theme of intense interest while the people of the United States neverbestowedathought upon it. Our people never sent their war cry across the Atlantic but wheL such cause existed as roused every township, and the merit and purport of which were known in every school district. Four times has the sword been unsheathed, and although, in one of the instances, partially only, the nation stood ready to sustain the whole quarreL The rGvolutiot was a fight for life, the war of 1812 for rank in the family of nations, the war with Algiers for a free flag, and the quasi war with lrance was to mdiento that insolence might be nushed too far. On all these the nation reosoned, debated, conversed among themselves, from house to house, and the strong act followed the strong resolve; hut this last Parliamentary war-cry the people of America heeded as little as though it had been the green corn dance of the Camanches. Too busy with earnest questions at home to heed the alarm abroad, for whichthere was only breath and life enough to give imperfect utterance, the people of the Repubic forgot that diplomacy was in a knot. I write to record the fact of the utter indifference of the people of the country to all the seeming struggle of wors and despatches. We heard of the arrival of troops at Qaebee, and the only sensation was that of pleasure that there would be more of nageant at the citadel as our parties of pleasure traverse the queer highways of that quaint fortress city. M1r. CrauDpton left, followed, as the tail the comet, by the console; and the only curiosity manifested was to "guess'" who would fill their snug places, inasmuch as England's liberality towards its officials is widely known. Old citizens recollected that Copenhagen Jackson was turned off, and that the incident soon died out and waS of no moment. The country never stirred for this rumour of war. The peace addresses of the people of England do but liAd refined gold. The peace sentiment has not even had a smador p&ass before its brightness. Nothing but a great question can rive asunder these nations. lNo sudden chasm comes between England and the United States. It will slowly and solemnly open if it ever eidsts.

MADEMOISELLE PICCOLOMINL-THE TBA VIA TA. TO THE EDFITOR OF THEI TIMES. Sir,-In last Monday's eation of 2'he Tire there appeared an article copied from a weekly paper called the Spccinor. The writer of that article speak-s harshly of the Damc aec Cam,6lias, from which the subject of the Traviata is taken. He spealks harshly of Verdi, the composer of the opera, aud most harshly of Mademoiselle Ficcolomin,vwho has made the part of Violetta so famous. The virtuous anger of the writer is roused in consequence of the heroine of the story being a " lcrette," who falls into a decline and dies, because she is separated from her lover, and is, moreover, obliged to bear the insulting reproaches of the man forwhose welfare she sacrifices her life; and he isindignant, because " the female; - aristocracy " were invited to witness so immoral a drama. It is certany Wrong to make a courtezan the interesting heroine of a drama, and it was wrong of Verdi to choose. stckh a subject for his opera. But has the gifted writer and virtuous citizen who i& author of the article, and.who shows such praiseworthy anxiety about the morals of the "female aristocracy." never heard of an opera, called Lucrezia Bo,gia, or Doz. Gioranni, or Bigoitto I The subject of the first is incest anrd murder, of the second unbridled debauchery and in the third the public are all but mnade to witness the sequel of a rape, and through nearly an entire act they have revealed to them the lewd dalliance of an accrolicu,sc de la rue. The "female aristocracy" of Britain, and of many another country besides, havo season after season sat and witnessed these operas and. applauded ths performers. Why has not the virtuous defender of the morals of the "female aristocracy" attacked Grisi and Bosio and Nantier Didi6e for the parts they have taken in these operas? And why has he not condemned the first lady in this empire for having, with her Court, sat to witness such performances The writer in the Specator ought to klow that there is a great difference between dramas like those of Victor HEugo and Young Damas and the libretto of an opera, which is but an entangled travestie of the original story. It is for the music and not for the wnretched libretto that people go the opera. From the opera they bring away with them bitt the airs, as from the drama they bring the words and the story. The article in the Spectator would have had no importance had it not been copied into 2%c 11ines. I, in common With the majority of the millions througiout this empire who regalarly read 2Te Times, never see the S.pectalor, and most assmredly would have never heard of the eloquent reproach to the "female aristocracy" contained in last Saturday's number but that you, Sir, had thought it worthy of being copied into your columns. Thewriter of the articleremaTks that the young Countess Piccolomini, in the part of Violetta, was like those wretchecl girls who in the last century played parts of disgasting obscenity for the gratification of the profligates of those days. I refrain from commenting on the dastardly character of the person who could so write of an unoffending young lady; but I would advise him to take & dictionary and carefully translate the WibreUo of the Traviala, and, if he can point out a single impure expression in the whole opera, I wil then believe that he did not make this attack from personal motives, and that he is sincerely zealous for the morals of our "female aristocracy." I remain. Sir. Tour obedient servant. .AN ACTOR (NOT A SPECTATOR.) Londcon, Aunga 60.

Upon inquiry it was ascertained that he had arrived at Liverpoolon the previous day from Nlew York by the RoyLl mail steamer Africa, after a voyage of 10 days, havnmg travelled a distance of 3,000 miles, and afterwiy pro. ceeded toLondoii, where he remained afewhoums Should he reach his destination in the usual time occupied in the transmirsion of the mails by the ships of the Meninsulna and Oriental CompanT. he will have accompiished nearly 12,000 miles in 47 days, thereby showing an average of continuous travelling of nearly 11 miles per hour, or about 260 miles every 24 hours-in fact, a distance greater than half the circumference of the earth. It will be remembered, with the exception of about 500 miles, the entire distance has to be performed by water.

[A portlo2n of 'ho foUowivX a;pewed fi our aecond editloa of Teterdv:-- -PABLS, TuEsDAYS , P.6 The anxiety of the Moni6eu-r to justifythe present Spanish Government, and especially to prove -that there has been no coup cr'tat at Mladrid, induces it to publish to-day a letter dated from that capital; but which has hardly come from a greater distance than Plombiares. The letter is -an article recapitaMatirg recent events in Spain, with such variations and colouring as suit the purpose of thewriter. Everything, we are told, took place in a perfectly constitutional 3nanner, and those wvho acted unconstitu. tionallv were "the minority of the Cortes," vwho had the temerity to assemble and pass a vote of nonconfidence in the new vDMinistry. As, with very f4wf exceptions, the whole of the Paris press has afflirmed or impliedthat theC!orte3hadno riaht toassemble,that the deputies were not ia the nutuber or in the legal conditions requisite toforin a House, that they were not regularey convoked, and that their meeting was xather a factious assembly than a representation of the nation, I wvill briefly state the real circumstances I of that meeting. It is the practice of the Spanish Cortes, when they propose to suspend their sessioa for a time without being prorogued, for the President or Vice-President to say, at the close of a sitting, that notice wiiU be given to the deputies at their houses (se arisard a doenicilio) when the next s-to take place. This is what was done on the 1st of July, when the Chamber sat for the last time. By private understanding and agreement between the President and deputies it was not to be convoked again until the 1st of October, unless in case of something extraordinary occurring. On the 14th of July something very extraordinary did. occur. There was a nocturnal change of Ministry, and the first act of the new Government was to proclaim Spain under martial law. Thereupon the President of the Cortes, General Irifante, certainly not an Exaltado or an advanced Progresista, but, on the -contrary, a man of great moderation in his views, called the Chamber together. Ninetv-threedeputies were present; only 54) are required to constimitte a House. Eighty-one deputies, ineluding the fPresident, passed a vote of w;nt of confidence in -the Ministry; one deputy oppo.ed the measure, the remaining 11 writhdrewv or abstained from voting. It w;as then resolved that a Comission should be appointed to communicate to the Queen the decisicn come to. This step was strictly legal and in conformity with usage. It is known that the ,Commission was fired upon when on its way to the Palace, and forciblyprevented from fulfilling the mijesion intrusted to it by the Cortes. These are the exact circumstances of the affair, w hich has repeatedly been distorted and misrepresented, zither wilfully or through ignocan-ce. The illonitier insists very much utpon the right of -the Queen to change her Prine Minister if she thouglht proper so to do. Nobody calls this right in quest;on; but the French official journal woul have done well to limit itself to tbis indisputable proposition, instead of pathetically expatiating on .the fruitless efforts made by the Queen to retain both the Marshals in her Cabinet-on the entreaties of O'Donnell that she would preferEspartero to him -and on the attempts of both O'Donnell and the Queen to induce the President of the Council to recall his resignation and undertake the formation of the new Ministry. Thelon.iteutris assuredlytoo well informed not to be aware that all this was a mere comedy, and that everything had been pre-arranged. Her Catholic M3ajesty has a turn for irony, and 'would shine in such a situation. On the 10th of July she wrote to a near relative of hers, now in France, a letter in wvhich she said that O'Donnell had promised to rid her of Espartero. Nevertheless, on the night of the 13th we find her, according to the Moniteur, vainly endeavouring to retain the latter in her counsels. It is possible that Espartero -saw through the plot, as it is also possible that he refused in expectation of being pressed; but, instead of insisting, Isabella quietly remarked that if he would not do it O'DonnelU would, and, turning to the latter, ordered him to form a Government. Eince that nighst Espartero has had one more audience of the Queen (perhaps the last he will ever seek), to inform her of his desire to withdraw completely from public affairs. Since then he hias left for Logrono. That final interview between the Queen and her fallen Minister would have been curious to witness. There are those who imagine that she must at least have some personal atfec- tiou for the man who fought for her when she was in the cradle, watched over her in her childhood, and has repeatedly saved her throne. I believe this to be quite a mistake. The real services Espartero has rendered her are insufficient to counterbalance the recollection of the restrictions he has at times been compelled to impose upon her whims. A warm-hearted man, it is -well known that he is really attached to her, and, while deploring her errors, has always, when circumstances have given him control over her, carried indulgence to the utmost limit of duty. But she is not a person to appreciate his attachrnent or his zeal for her tree interests; she would have a better memory for certain mortifications and disappointments which her own conduct compelled him to occasion her than for the great services he has done her; and if she spared him, at their last interview, the sly shafts of her malicious wit, there can be no doubt that she witnessed his departure with satisfaction, anid congratulates herself on having got rid of a troublesome mentor and of a Minister whiose policy, although she was compelled for a while to adopt it, has always been diame*trically opposed to her own hereditary desire for aLsolute power. Let O'Donnell be on his guard, or his turn wili come next. He assuredly has no better hold on the Royal sympathies than his late colleague, whom he intrigued to displace; and if he be smiled upon for the moment, it is only because the pear is not yet ripe, and it might be unsafe to precipitate matters. Letters received to-day from Mdrid repeat the belief that Rios Rosas will prove dangerous to him, and will seek to betray him into a reactionary path, once launched on which he must fall if he strives to stop. The announcement in the Monsiteur that, although -the Emperor will be at St. Cloud on the 15th instant, there will be no official reception, excites surprise. It is not yet known whether the Court will go to Biarritz. Marshal Pelissier was to go direct from Marseilles tolPlombi6res. Count Walewski is expected here to-morrow night. M. de Mormy set out three days ago for St. Petersburg. The coronation of the Czar is postponed to the 7th of September. Bf. Thiers having left Paris some days ago for Germany, various reports have been current as to the motives o£ his journey, which has been sapposed to have connexion with the affairs of the exiled Royal famnily. It is impossible to say what rencont;res he may make in the course of his tour, which, however, I am assured has no political object. He has gone to visit various battle-fields, Lutzen, :1autzen, heipsic, &c., a personal knowiledge of which will be useful to him in the completion of that portion of his History of tlte mpire in which heis at present engaged. It is now some weeks since you were informed, from the Danubian Principalities, that the Croatian Ga-anzer Regiments were called under arms, and were said to be required for service in Italy. The order was very sudden, and there seemed a wish to keep it secret. I now learn that several battalions of these frontier troops, and nearly 100 guns, have been sent to reinforce the command of Marshal Radetzky, who applied some time back for an increase of strength, and especially for more artillery. All the mailitary precautions in the Italian provinces of Austria are continued, an(d this is considered to be, perhaps, a conse- quence of the threat implied in Count Cavours project of law for the fortification of Alessandria. TIhe late events in Spain are also supposed to have some influence in that respect. The success of the liberal party in Spain would have been encouraging -to the Italians, but -the triumph of O'Donnell must relieve Austria of all uneasinss. on that head. ha the Duchy of Parma, too- the causes of anxiety that exicted have disappeared, at least for tihe moment, if I may credit my latest information from that quartter. General Baumgarten replaces Count Oenneville as general coinmanding. -He is said to me q uan of decision, but at the same time one wh:o will make himself sgreeable to the Duchess Regent. Tho following is the DMadrid letter in the 7 nzc-rred to above:- "in order to appreciate exctly the events which have taken place in Madrid, the manner in which the last clange of Ministry occured must not be lost sight of, while the happy influnc=e emercised by this change can alone be un. derstood by a recollection of the state of anarchy which the renissula has escaped. Matters, as far as tha Crowan is con- corned, have followed a perfectly cons itutional course. The resolution which confided thecchsef power to the hinds,ofMarshal O'Donnell7 ws derived fronm the legal exercise of the prerogptive of the Throne. The Ministry having offere& its resignatiou, in consequence of internal dissensions, Her Majesty had at first boped to succeed in introducing the two Marshals into a new combination. Espartero ha4ing proposed conditions which could not be accepted by O'Donnell, this latter, before accepting the mission of forming a newAdministration, -considered it properto remind the Queen of the great political influence exercised by the Duke de la Victoria. The Count himself represented to his co!league the grave nature of the events which might accompany that statesmar's withdrawal, and employed sincere efforts in endeavouring to persuade him to keep the presidency of tho Council. The Qaeen took her decision only after having in vain endeavonued to maintain Espartero's presence in her council; and it is 7mdeniable that Marshal O'Donnell, on his side, so far front having wished to sup. plant a rival, neglected no measure which could insure his co-operation. Espartero positively refused, and then only did the Queen proceed, in virtue of her co nstitutioual functions, to form a new Ministry to replace that which had abandoned her amid the most complicated and serious difficulties. The accounts of certain foreign journals, according to which this change was accompanied by forms savouring of a. coup d'tltet are founded therefore on a completely erroneous appreciation of the facts of the crisis. Doubtless Marshal O'Donnell was compelled to recur to force in order to maintain the Royal authority; but his conduct in this circumstance in no way affected the lawvs of tne country. He only suppressed an in. surrection whicn no measure or word of the new Ministry could. explaun. Before having accomplished any act, the Minister was encountered by a vote of distrust on the part of a minority of the Cortes, and by musket shots which proceeded from the National Guard united with the rioters of the faubourgs, He was attacked instead of hav. ing been the aggressor; and if that struggle, which he had not sought, permitted him to substitute a conservative policy for a revolutionary one, he obtained 'hat position by an entirely legitimate defence. Those who, in reality, abandoned the constitutional path were they who failed to respect the decision of the Queen, and attempted to subvert by revolt a Ministry which was established in a regular manner, and of the programme of which they wera still ignorant. It is thus, we firmly believe, that history will judge the resptctive conduct of the two parties which found thems.elves in hostile presence in the streeb of Madrid and Barc6Iona. Itis, besides, fortunate for the Peninsula that the ultra fraction of the Progresista party should spontaneously have led to its own destraction, and afforded an opportunity of bringing to a close a system of disorganization and anarchy. It is impossible, in fact, not to admit the danger of a situation which the certain tolerance of the demecratical party had created in the provinces, even more perhaps than at Madrid itself. For two years, owing to the impotence of the Administration, subversive doctrines had been dissemir,ated without hindrance among the working classes. Last. year the evil effects of such doctrines had been seen at Barcelona, and in a -number of other localities of inferior importance. Independently of a^ts which did not cease to give proofs of a hotbed of Socialism in Catalonia, at the same period acts of violence of the same nature took place on a vast scale at Valladolid, Palencia, and Bioseco. Threats against property, cries of death against the rich in the most industrious provinces of the kingdom, are proofs not only of the progress of Socialism during the last sLx months, but of an organization becoming stronger and stronger of the juntas which directed that combined movement. It is certain that if the military force has put down these risings, the bad spirit of the civil administration was more calculated to encourage than to prevent them. And even had the civil administration been disposed to cause property and public order to be respected, it found itself paralyzed by the false ideas which prevailed in the Cortes and by the un. certaindirectionswhich were sent from Madrid. It was thrus that at Valladolid the persons most ardent after pillage were liberated convicts, who were allowed to be there by the fault of the police. Thus also the insurgents of Madrid forced the prisons to obtain additional assistance Recourse to such singular auxiliaries to defend a constitution which had not been violated, and to repel a COtp d'eta which had not been attempted, proves safficiently what suggestions the insurrection obeyed, what was its real object, and with what danger it would have menaced not only the Royal authority, but the whole range of social order, had it triumphed." The following private telegraphic despatches have been received:- " MARSEILLES, AUG. 4. "The arrivals of grain succeed each other. 10,00) hectolitres have been disembarked. " The latest intelligence from Constantinople is to the 28th ult. The evacuation by the allied troops will have Iterminated by the 15th, and the hospitals given up.

In consequence the Marshal left this morning at 9 o'clock by an express train for Lyons." 1" V.IEINTA, AurG. 5.

(r,comp osV' of P.th Egrof tDENr.) society, a.ARSEIcLES, AcuG. 4. bThe theatrical represenaion g,iven on Saturday ;in honour of MIarshal Pelissier passed offS extremely Iwell. The fasade of the theatre was brilliantly illemirated, and the interior- was tastefully deco- Irafed, On the entrance fd the Marshal, attendea I by thle Mayor of Marseilles, General Carondelet, (representing Genaela RostolanR) and his Staum, the audience, composed of the dhite of the Marseilles society, rose and loudly cheered the conqueror of ;hSebastopol. The vaudevilles represented, n By the, do throtpiersezad GhouePoach e, containsome episodes of- camp life, which caused the MIarshal to laugh heartily. After the conclusion of the fir.st piece, Madame Danbrun, attired in Roman costume, camne forward, and recited an ode in houzour of the Mar- Isb-aL. She then placed a gtold crown on his bust, *i which stood on the stage, and was followed by the. other actres ses, who each deposited a latuel crown at its feet. The orchestra was occupied by the band of a t I 9at, Recdiuimnt, lately P.tined' eoion the1 Crimea, which played slevera national airs during the afternoon. Yesterday morning - the Marshal visited the Zoological-gardens, where he was received by the - directors. - A collation was offered to him and his suite, after which he accepted the title- of honorary president of the Zoological Society of Marseilles, of which he was one of the original founders. The grand banquet took place in the afternoon. At the point where the Alles of MIeilhan and the Capucines meet a magnificent tent was erected, covered 'with a silk vehu-iuin, trimmed with velvet and gold lace. Under this tent was placed a table of horseshoe shape, sufficient to accommodate 200 guests. The outside, as well as the interior, of the tent vwas decorated most tastefully with statues, trophies, and various ornaments. Tables were placed on the Boulevards, extending from the tent to the extremities of the alleys. These tables, at which were seated the soldiers and seamen present at Marseiles who had served in the Crimea, wtre covered with a substantial supply of cold fowl, ham, and fruit, together with a suifficient quantity of wine. As. early as 4 o'clock persons provided with tickets permitting them to walk round the tables began to arrive. At half-past 5 tne soldiers and sailors took their seats. At half-past 6 the MIunicipal Council received the Marshal at the extremnity of the Boulevards. The Blarslhal, accompanied bythe Bishop of Mar-eisles, and followed by his suite, walked round the line of tables, and was loudly cheered by his companions in arms. He then took his seat under the tent opposite to the Mayor, having the Bishop of Marseiles on his right and General Carondelet on his left. The other places were filled by the judges, representatives of the bar, the administrative bodies, and the learned societies. The consular body was represented by Mr. Tambrull, the British Consul, and his collea_ue of Sardinia. The first toast proposed aft4rdinner was by General Carondelet, "To the Emperor, to worthy of governing our fine country." Due honour havingbeen done to the toast, the Mayor rose and proposed in a neat speech " Marshal Pelissiar and the army of the East." After the cheering which followed the toast bad subsiced the Mlarshal replied in the following terms "Monsieur le Maire,-I am profoundly affected by the f9attering sentiments you have expressed, and I am not less sensible of this vwarns and cordial reception given me by tha city of Marseilles. I further thank you, Sir, for the honours decreed to that brave army at whose head the Ermperor's confidence placed me, for to itmuch umore than to its General is due the success which you celebrate to day. Never in fact did an army give a finer example of courage constancy, self-denial, and devotion under such severe trials. It is to those soldiers, united with our brave and faithfELI allies, anLd guided by the Emperor, whose sagacious prepara tions insured the success, that France and Europe are in debted for that glorious peace of which you, Sir, have enumerated the fortunate consequences. I trust that the city of Marseiles will reap the first benefit, and that its industrial talent may find in it a new source of prosperity. Such, at least, is my most ardent wish. I give you, Sir'Prosperity to the city of Marseilles."' The Bishop of Marseilles, who, by the way, 'was gallant cavalry ofiicer before he entered the Church next proposed-" The Army, and the alliance of French valour with a Christian spirit." The Marshal replied briefly to the toast, aussing his Grace that the French truops had ever fought withlthe valour and faith of the Crusaders, united with the solidity of the soldiers of Austerlitz. The list of toasts having been exhausted, and Marshal Pelissier, finding that no allusion had been made to the allies who supported France with their blood and treasure duning the war, rose and said:- "'Gentlemen,-I did expect that somebody would have proposed a toast to our brave allies, but, nothing to that effect having been offered, I must say that we have acted | like egotists. Your silence compels me to recall to your recollection the firmness and the valour of the British armay, which showed 's how to conquer or to die, the constant spirit of concord and confraternity of which it gave us so mnany proofs, as well as the eagerness with which the Sardinian army, but recently created, joined our ranks, and the noble courage with which it fought. I am confident, gentlemen, that these observations will find an echo in your hearts, and I consequently propose to you ' the health i of the gracious Queen of Great Britain,' and another toast, 'the Sing of Sardinia."' The toasts having been enthusiastically honoured the Marshal rose, and, havig again walk-ed round thetables at which the soldiers and seameu were seated, drove home in M. Lucy's carriage, escorted by a troop of Lancers. I cannot omit an episode which occurred when the guests enitered the tent, and which, for a moment, menaced the harmony of the meeting, The Bishop took possession of the seat to the right of the Marshal. General Carondelet claimed the seat, his name having been affixed to it. The Bishop refused to abandoni it, and when the Miayor, on an appeal being made to him, requested his Grace to j take the seat to the left, the Bishop coolly replied, " It is my right and I will maintain it ;" and so he% did. After the company retired the houses on the Boulevards were brilliantly illuminated. There was a slight thunderstorm and some heavy rain between 8 and 9 o'clock, but it quickly passed away. Marshal Pelissier proposed to visit the Church of Notre Dame de la Garde to-day to return thauks for his safe return to France, but he received a telegraphic despatch during the nightfrom the Emperor, which compelled him to leave for Plombieres at 9 this morning. On the departure of tho train the Marshal was saluted by the guns of the forts. SPAIN. Our accounts from Madrid are of the 1st inst. An extraordi;.ary Gazette publishes the following:- " The President of the Council of Ministers and Minister of War has received the following telegraphic despatch from Saragossa, addressed to him to-day, at half-past 1 o'clock-, by the Captain-General of Arragon - " ' I have just entered the city, where I was received with the usual honours. The National Mitia is now surrendering its arms to the respective commanders, who are to deliver them to the competent authorities. The greatest tranquillity prevails in the city, and, if your Excellency think-s p.,-oper, the battering train ma,y be ordered back t, Madrid. The troops who had come from Catalonia and Valencia have returned to those provinces. I have appointed Brigadier Bmrnuaga Deputy Commander ad iJn taira. "' The official journal contains a Royal decree, appointing Al. Jose Maria Palavea Governor of thie Province of Navarre, and others accepting the resignations of the Governors of the provinces of Alicante, Alneria, Logrono, and Badajoz. The Basque provinces continue to enjoy the greatest tranquillity, although the entire military force has been withdrawn from them, and marched to Saragossa. The band of 14 individuals 'which had raised the standard in the mountains of Biscay, being closely pursued by the Miquelets, had made its submission. The accounts from Catalonia 'were likewise satisfactory. Barcelona and the other important towns of the province ws-ere tranquil. /The factiousbands which General Ruiz attempted to organize in the mountains had completely disappeared. The Marquis del Duero was believed to have accepted the post of Captain-General of the Halberdiers, vacant by the resignation of the Duke of San Miguel. The Queen had approved the ceremonial to be observed on the occasion of the celebration of the marriage of the Infanta, sister of the King, with the Princeof Bavaria. On the 3ist the editors of the journals Le Bst-elki and LD Begeveracion were set at liberty. I The Government was seriously preoccupied with the food question. The ayuntamiento of Madrid had for some weels paid out of the municipal funds 20,000 or- 30,000 reals daily, in order to prevent a rise of half a real in the price of bread. Still greater difficulties presented themselves in some towns of the province. At Vicalvaro, for instance, there was no bread to be had on the 31st. The aui thorities, on being apprised of the fact, immediately sent off to Vicalvaro the secretary of the Civil Governor, wvho, l-aving assembled the proprietors and farmers, insured the supply of the town, where a regiment of cavalry is quarlerad. : TURKE Y. (E203f OVR OWN, ConRarONDE-Ne.) CONSTAINOPLB, JULY 28. Redschid Paslha has arrived. He came in on Thursday morning, the 24th inst., on board the [Fgyptian frigate Faid Gihaad,- which Said Pasha had placed at the disposal of his guests from Stamboul. As lhe was expected on that day, the country house3 oni the Bosphor-a inhabited by Turkish officials and ! others seemed converted into so many look-out ata- -k - tions, and the news of his arivaLspread along. both shores with, the rapidity of a telegraph, ao that by the time, the steamer stopped at Emerghisz in face of Redachid Pasha's mew palace, a crowd of calques had collected at the quay bordering lit, and.a Ministers, ,pshas, officials and -non-officials, and a great nlamber 6o people from the inei8hbourhood, rwere there, to receive hWm.' This empresse"net to ,receive' a mau who is nlOt.ii oflice shows more than anything else the position' Redschid Pasha-occupies, and the ascendancy which he exercises overfriendand foe. He isthe onlyman in Turkey who by -his conduct has acquired a personal influence not due to the momentary occupation -of some .high offlice, vwile all other officials courted only asiong as they are in office sink b;ck into oblivion =hen they lose the place from which they derived their importance. As long as the Mistry was, if not united, at least undivided, and as long as they could pay off avery difficulty with promises, the members did not feel so mueh the necessity of leaning on this en- ceptional power; on the contrary, some of them, I flushed by a momentary success, thought to be able to set it aside, or even step into Redaschid's place; but now, when the Ministry itself is, as was sooner or later expected, divided in itself, now that notes of promise " won't do" any more, and acts are required, it is natural that all sbould be anxious to draw nearer to a man wno is sure to give the ascendancy to that of the nearly equally balanced parties to which he may ally himself, and who alone is able to extricate Turkey from the dilemma into which she has been driven of late. The Council of State, which, as I told you in my last, has taken up the subject of public instruction in the empire, made a few days ago some useful suggestions for the diffusion of knowledge and instruction. One of them has reference to the Imperial printing establishment, and the other has been made with the object of facilitating the purchase of printed books in the provinces. As regards the first, the Council of State is anxious to remove the anomaly which places the Imperial printing .establishment ander the control of theBMinistryof Finance, likemostotherestablishments paid by the Treasury. This could pass ai long as there wvas no special branch of the GoTernment to -whose sphere this establishment could be referred, but there exists now a Council of Public Instruction specially intrusted with everything connected with education and the propagation of knowledge, which must bc supposed to be more fit to saperintend this establishment than a committee of the linistry of Finance. The latter, however, adheres to its right of managing the printing department, and hitherto the Council of State could not carry out its views in this respect. I need not tell you that it is not so much a love of books or a mania for printing whiclh makes the Minister of F?inance obstinate as the ansiety to have the management of the capital of the Imperial printing establishment; and yet they cannot exactly boast of the results of their management, at any rate as far as the printing is concerned, for their activityis nearly at a standstilL The reason of this is, that a number of hMavy scientific works have been printed, which have scarcely any sale at all, and thus a considerable part of the capital is lying dead and profitless. The Council of State now proposes to make some alteration in this respect, to sell at any price those cumbrous folios, and print with the proceeds books more for the people than for the learned, giving thus a little life and activity to the establishment. The other suggestion, as I said, has for its object to facilitate the purchase of books in the provinces. This is nearly impossible under the present circumstances-first, because there are no booksellers, escept in the large towns, and they sell the books at three and four times their price, which in most cases amounts to a prohibition. The Councilof State proposes to have circulars issued to the Moodirs of every district, with a list of tho books which are sold at the printing establishment, and the prices. Every one who wants to get one of the books would have only to deposit the price with the Mal-Moodiri, or revenue collector, andc get the book sent by the post, which will carry books at a reduced rate, namely, at 5 piastres every package under I oke, or 2 lb. weight, for 40 hours, or 120 miles, while aU other articles have to pay double, or 10 piastres. The tribunal charged with the inquiry into the murder of the young Greek girl has had six sittings, under the presidency of Ahmed Vefik Effendi, but is yet far from having terminated its labours. The difficulty, as I told you before, is the non-appearance of the two principal witnesses, which it was th daty of those charged with the preliminary inquirv to find out, and for which they had from seven to eight months' time. As it is, however. the examination has already elicited an important fact, Jamely, the innocence of one of the corporals, whose ol seems proved clearly enough. At the same time no particle of evidence has appeared as yet vwhich wvould implicate Salik Pasha as the prime author of the crime. The second Secretary of the Russian Embassy has arrived, with the papers and archives of the Enbassy. PRUSSIA. (rnox oun oWN coxsPron-DMrT.) BERIN', Aurusr 4. The ocrasion which has brought back the Ring of Prussia, the Empress Dowagerof.Russia, and Prince Carl to Potsdam with such punctuality, at the cormmencement of this month, is the anniversary of the late King's (their father's) birtiday, which was yesterday spent by the Royal family in their usual quiet and domestic manner at Charlottenburg. In thegrounds of that Palace are still kept up the little gardens which the broticers and sisters in early childhood regarded and tendea as theirown; ad there also lie thg remains of the late Ring, their father, FriedriehWilhelmlll. side by side -with those of his Queen Louisa, in the mausoleum known to so many of your readers. The memory of the late Ring is cherished with particuilar affection by those wholived under his mildandbenevolent-reign, and themselves shared largely in the sorrows, indignities, and privations to 'which thewhole of Prussia, but more particularly its Royal family, were subjected by the French invasion and occupation; but one looks in vain into memoirs and biographies for any mention of brilliant shining qualities of genius or talent that might account for this warmth of kindly feeling with which his memory is still regarded. The annual recurrence of a festal address delivered in the university on the subject of the late King has long since exhausted all that can be said in his praise, while the time is still far distant when' an audience will be found here willig to listen to anything in his dispraise; and so it happened that Professor Ehrenberg's (the rector's) speech delivered in the auda yesterday was indebted for its interest not to the prescribed subject, but to his deviations from it, and, at the same time,to his deviations from the style, -tone, and nature of the learned discourses generally delivered there. I The palace in wvhich the late King lived so long and died so regretted is, as I mentioned in a recent letter, the destined residence of the Princess Victoria, as 'the future consort off Prince Friedrich Wilhelm of Prissia. This palace is replete with interesting historical recollections that reach back to a time antecedent even to theelevationof the electorate of Brandenbura into the kingdom of Prussia, and to the establishment.of the Hanoverian dynasty on the throne of Enigland; they are recollections which as sociate and intertwiine together the various incidents in subsequaent history that have led more or less directly to'the projected union of the two :Royal fariilies. This palace was originally built by the great Elbetor for Marshal Schomberg, Generalissimo of the military forces of Brandenburg, and whom, together'vithsundryregiments of Brandenburghers, he leLt 'to' William: m. of Orange to aid' him in . effecting the rescue of the people Of England from 'the' -Romish yoke. that threatened them under James II. The Duchess Sophia of Hanover, the mother -ofGeorge, the flist King of the HTanoverian line, was themotlher also of Sophia Charlotta, the consort of the-first Ring of Prussia, Friedrich I.; to her, therefore, the twoRoyal families, th eEnglishonthemale' and the Prussian on the female side, may be traced up:a's to their comrmon mnother. It was in honour of the- memory of Sophia Charlotta, the sister .of: i qeorge I. tiatthQ Royal. residence oi Liezenburtr rece;ved the name.of Charlottenburg, whicrh it still -bears, and .that: Leilinitz committed to paper his Thcocsce, the principles of which had so often formned the subject of coaversation with that most accomplished queen. A daughter of George I., and sister of George IT., Sophia Dorothea, became also tlha wife of Friedrch Wilhelm I., (the second Ring of Prussia), and' the mother' of Friedrichl. the Great, Iwho:. 'spent ia. large. portion of his life in the :palace. of . the late King, now MeIrrved 'for: the future' bridal coiiple; this -buildinghang-.beens et aside by his father as the residence of the Crown Princes of Prussa, and atiist.tlmearink.the inscription, "Padais d2s Prince R4Ijyalde. Prse." It was a favourite pln wvith Sophia Dorothea to unite her eldest on!z Friedrich, with the Pinncess Amalia, daughter of.. lGeorge II., and her elde1 t daughter with the Prince of Wales:;theinfluence of Austria, however, ind! the personal antipathy which FriedrichWilhelm _L entertained for his brother-in-law, George lI., prevented the plan attaining accomplishment. A sinilar plin, it isbelieved, had for many years occupied die mind and feelings of the present Princess of Prussia, whose whole heart and soul are devoted -to liberal views of governnment and a constitutional v-egirne, for the introduetion of waich into Prussia and their subsequentu development she fondly trusts to the seeds she has already inplanted deep in the heart of tbe young Prince her son, and which sesm at present to be prospering mnost auspiciously under the inflaence of his approaching inion with the Princess Victoria. Rrince Friedrich Wilhelm has this.great advantao;e over his great ancestor Frederick the Great, that with him the course of true love runs considerably smoother; no opposition to the match on the part of father or uncle has compelled him to fly his father's Court, has brought on hims personal1 chastisement and incarceration, or dloomed him +o see his favourite and the assistant in his flight led away to the scaffold without the power to save him; and, if, like Frederick the Great, he has even written, as is not improbable, to the Queen of Xngland to declare he " will never iarry any other -woman than her daughter," there is every reason for believing that the declaration has been perfectly borne out by free affection, and is not, as in the former case, mainly the result of the opposition exhibited byhlisfatherto the mother's favourite project. ITALY. (PROX OUR OWE- CoriroNDtNr.) TURIN, aUG 2. The comments of Republicen and reactionary journals during the last day or two on the recent affair in the SDuchy of Massa are much what might have been expected. They endeavour to cast all the blame of exciting and encouraging revolutionary movements on those whomthey feel tobe their worst enemies-theGovernment of Piedmont,supportedby its allies of France and England. The Italia e Popolo, Mazzini's organ, says the movement was organized by the friends of Piedmont, and the fact is proved by the presence of the French and English ilinisters at Spezzia at the ti'me it took place, and by the insurgents having crossed the frontier crying" 1Viva la Costit.aione !" "Viva i Carabinieni Belae!' The rioters having disarmled one post, andmade themselvesmasters of the ducal chest, announced themselves, says the It(lia C Popolo, as the advanced guard of the Piedmontese army, and the people of the Duchies of Massa and Carrara, although for many years conspicuous for constant opposition to the Princes of the House of Este (they have only been subject to them since December, 1847), and by conspiring in a national sense, have no sympatbies with monarchical institutions or Carabineers (Gendarnes), or the Piedmnontese army, and therefore they remained passive, and the attempt failed. The clerical Asrnonia says:- " See the effect of Count Cavour's condtxct at the Paris Conferences, of your speeches in Parliament, and diplomiatic notes, Here were neither Mazzinian agents nor Austrian agents, but Ministerial agents instead, and Mazzini really was most Ministerialist on this occasion. He sustained the verbal note and protect of Count Cavour in the Congress of Paris; he obeyed the word of order pronounced from the Piedmontese Tnbune; he laboured that the liniste3il prophecy of a revolution should be fulfilled. Behold, then, to what a charming Itall,n unity these new men. lead you I The Pope, the King of Xaples, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, and the Duke of Modena shake hands fraternally, being joined by a common idea, while Piedmont remains solitary on the Alps, esteemed not by foreigners alone, but also by enenmies." The Armonia adds in a correspondence from Sarzana that the Sardinian Government had offered to lend the Duke of Modena 2,000 men to suppress the revolutionary spirit, which was refused with thank3s by the latter, wrho said he had no need of assistance, being strong enough in his own government for the purpose. The story has not been repeated, however, by other papers, and rests entirely on the authority of the Arenonia. It is not very probable that the Sardiniau Government would volunteer such an offer at the present moment, though no doubt in the cause of order it would be ready to assist the Government of Modena at any time in maintaining its legitimate rights, but just now it is evidently the object of all Italian patriots to prove to Europe that the Governments of Italy are well able to maintain themselves, provided their administration is suited to the wants of their subjects, and I believe the reason why the Austrian I troops have not crossed the Po on this occasion is, that the GovermnentsoflFrance andEngland have expressed a desire to the ViennaCabinet that the experiment should be tried of allowing these States to set- tle their own differences in future. So sig-niicant a! hint might be expected to have great weight with our belligerent ally, but the effect must have been powerful indeed to have restrained her from her favourite policy of intervention under such tempting circumstances. A national subscription has been commenced in Piedmont, at the suggestion of the Gtazetta dclZ Popolo of Turin, for the purpose of presenting the Government with 100 g-ns for the new fortifications at Alessandria. The idea has been well received throughout the country except by the Romanist party, who of course are highly incensed at it, and no -doubt it will soon be taken up in other parts of Italy. The guns are each to be named after an Italian town. Mr. Brett is to commence laying down the su1bmarine telegraph cable from Cagliari to Cape 13oa on Monday next, the Datchman, with the cable on board, haing arrived at Cagliari, as also the Tartare FRrench Government steamer, ordered to assist in the operation. __ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

Sir,-In your article on the diplomatic service, of the 2d inDSt., Ifear you too truly complain of the want of advoc;acy of British principles in our representatives at foreign courts. Bnt I trust from your fairness, of which I have observed frequent evidence, that you will admit a correction of your attemeuits,where exception can be shown, and I asl for this in the instaace of our represeatative at the Diet of Frankfort, SirAlexander Malet. Ipass over the causes, frea from aU family inffueence, which obtained for him his L-st appointment (when beyond the usual age) under Mr. Canrning; but the qualities demandea in the above article were plainly displayed bv him when, aftersomeyeaTs, at the requisition of a numerousboay of constituents at Marlborongh (being a Wilts proprietor), he stood for that borough on "reform principles," though through the preponderating influence of tho House of Aylesbary he was successfully opposed by Lord ErneAst Bruce, the present member. When Lord Cowley was promoted from Franlfori to Paris he was succeeded by Sir A. :alet, and on the occasion of his leaving Studgart, he having been our Minister at the Court of wurtemburg. c., sever-7years, a public dinner (bynomeans a usual occurrenco) was given in his honour, the proceedlngs and speeches at which dinner, as published in the German and French papers, proving how successfully the true British principles had been advocated by him in those prTts; aAd, lastly, not long ago, as was shovn byan accountin l'ks Tises, ofas public dinner given at Homburg, near Frankfort, whidh Sir .A.

ThDere are, perhaps, other instances of which I am not aivare; but, this one, I hope and trust you will record (as founded on facts published, and as referring to a public serYant 'ent to you without his cognizance), of a diplomatist and foreiga 3Enister of our MOst gracious Sovereign, who is not " ignorant of-the feelings 2nd- pursuits of his counhymen," who has imbibed something more than "thesmali ideas and- petty jealousies of a limited service," who still retains " the public spirit and national vigour of thought which- distlnguish: even ordinary xnglishmen ;" and who, 'though employed at a distance from " this warm hearth of free: discusion .and political conffict," yet, through occasional v.s.ts to his "fatherland," and, doubtless in great mesu-re, through the bright rays of an. enlightened press informing the wninds of, our countrymen throughout the world. catcies sufficient of that warmth to niehe them feel and say, wherever he be stationed, " We have an E; nglihman among us VI Your humble servant.

It was not long since a nins -was obtained in West Corwavuw for a few hundred pounds. Through the medium of this "advice" the shares were disposed of for 18,OOOt. Througholut the districtthe opinion of every comipeter; authority is, that the prospects did not warrant their disposal for as many farthings. Among the duped, no doubt there were men of standing and ample meams, the very persons to ircar the risk of seeking for mineral wealth. Disgusted vith such jobbery,' they resign themslves to the loss, vowing never to give another opportunity of being so deceived. Others there are who never extricate themselves from the difficuIlty; com. promised by miafortnes, cf which they never had recog. nized the possibility even, they are afraid to acknowledgeheir losses to friends, and get more hopelessly involved. - It is no donbt wilul folly on the part of the public, bat t is a wealness of our national character, that the same oft-' repeated deception should always find victims.

A more inteligent class of men than the captains of mines can with difficulty be found.

Let these few remarks be attended to, and let shareholders keep a strict'watch upon the economy of management, and I believe that British mining wl be rescued from its present aDomalous position.

Sir,-There are many other hearts that wMil be gladdened besides my own by theletter publishedinyour journat of yesterday, thc 5'.h inst., and signed 3 Crimean Officer." It is a plea on behalf of abhodg of mennwho, in their own sphere, fall of hardship and danger, have eqoalywith others discharged their duty, and have deserved well of their country, and the allant officer most rnghtly complains that after all their sufferance and endurance there is before the majority of fthem nothing. but cold neglect and disappointmient. I must, however, correct the statement of the writer of this letter, wberein he seems to think that too great a distinction has been made betw-een the "Socieybs men" and those of the " Goverment." I believe I may safely state that the amount of pay on both sides was nearly equal, the Society's chap'lains eceiving frol their employers 1001. per annum, with an additiomnd part of another 1001. from Government, andrallowances amount. ing to Ss. per diem. The Government men receive 1Os. a-day, and tbe same allowances; so that the difference was about -01. or 80Z. per annum. Nor, again, to do justicetothe Chaplain-Generalwho recommended the Government appointments, or to Lord Panumure, who confirmed them, do I think that interest had much weight in this matter; as in my own case and that of others of my brother chapains, no influencewas used norrequired. A personal interview sas demanded by the Chaplain-Gneral, references given of iitness of character, and the signat of the iishop required to the testimonial of d hree beuefced clergymen ia the diocess to which the applcant belonged -a very fair and juot way of dealing.

The Commissioners state that,notwithanding the-. - nmania for emigration, the great body of farmers who reoairs appear steadily to exert them9elves.

He suffered from an attack of deliriusm tremens, and for a time partially abstained from the ase of spirituous liquors; hut on losing a second and only surniving child hle relapsed into his former habits, and On the day preceding the dateof the will experienced a second attck of del.is-oi trenscsis, from which he never recovered, and was whelly incompetent, from mental and bodily wrealeness and infimnity, to Bi*e instructions for and duly execute the Dr. SPLNXS, on behalf of Mr. Lambert, submitted that the evidence in the cas<e wias sufficient to show that the wfill eanated from the deceased; that, although it was appar ently inoff3ciouls, yet there was no great intimacy subsisting betwieen him and his relations; that the allegation given in by Mr. Thompson was w holly disproved bv the only witness called to support it, and, therefore, he ought to he condenned in the costs from the time of setting it Up. Dr. ADDAIinS, on behalf of MIr.

MIDDLESEX SESSIONS, Wednesday, Augttst 6. (Before Mr. PasnLEY, Q. C., Assistant-fudge.) Alfred May Grey was brought up for judgment. The charges against him were reported yesterday. He had carried on a regular course of swindling, and some years ago was sentenced at the Old Bailey, in the name of Cruse, to 12 monthbs' hard labour for cospiring vith another man to obtain money by preferring indictments before the grand iury at this court against persons for keeping brothels. The AsisTsA-T-JvDGE said, it was stated that there were other charges against the prisoner, but none were proved. If any other charge had been proved before the Court the o aild have been severely dealt with. As it was, e dshold sentence him to 12 months for the felony of the lead, and to six months for the fraud-one sentence to commence at the expiration of the other. Caroline Bowxman, 20, and Louisa Clark, 18. were indicted for stealing two sovereigns and other moneys from the person of Arthur Power. The prosecutor was a sailor, having on his breast the Crimean medal, with the Sebastopol clasp, and he stated that on the 12th of July he was discharged from Her Mfajesty's ship Agamemnon, after which he began to enjoy himself on the arrears of pay he had received. He had served in that vessel three years. "Now, your Lordship," ho said, having been requested to give his evidence in his own -way, " on the 15th, you know, I was at the Sir Hugh Myddelton publichouse, by the Sadlers'-wells Theatre, when who should I fall in with but these two gals here, and they was very soon alongside of me; and says I to them, ' You can have a quartern of gin-and-cloves,' for them ere sort of gals is ven fond of gin-and-cloves, you know, my Lord.

S?UAMER ASSIZES. -C . HKOME CIRO. GUILDFORD. AUGvST 6. CROwx SrID.-4Before Mir. Justice BLr) Charles WilliUm Treagove Creuse, 40, a gentlemanlylooking man, who formerly was a captain in the Cape Mounted Rifles, was indicted for an assault upon a young girl named Sarah Marrion. When the prisoner was placed at the bar he appeared in a very excited state, and he insisted upon knowi&g, before the trial wvent on, w. hether any warrant had in the first instance been issued before ho wase taken into custody. He was at length psacified, and the case was Proceeded with. hir. Robinson conducted the prosecution; Mlr. Iilleyjwas eounsel for the defendant. The learned counsel for the prosecution having brifly opened the case, the prosecut-ris, a modest, respectablelooking girl, 18 years of age, wais examn ed, and deposced that she lived with her parents at Croydon, and the defendant and his wife resided at Woedside near that ton. On tho 24th of March, having heard that the defendant wanted a servant, she went to his xesidence to inquire about the place, she being at the time out of a situation. The defendant asked her to come in, and he then inquired bow old she was, and she told him her age, and he said that would just do; that he gave good wages, and she shonld have the place. The defendant then told her to go up stairsto speak to his wife, and she did so; hut, upon finding that there wvas no one in the room, she was about to return, when she observed the defendant close behind her, and w ithout sayling a wrord he took her in his srms, carried her into a bedroom, and threw her upon the bed. The witness then detailed the nature of the assault that was committed upon her, which was of a very aggravated cha,acter; and she said that she became insensible, and v hen she came to herself she proceeded down stairs, and found the defendant there. She immediately left the house and gave information of what had ocunrred, and on the same evening the defendant was taken into custody. The statement of the girl was corroborated by other witnesses5 who saw her after the transaction, and who said that she appeared in a most excited state, and, indeed, hardly to lknow bhat she was about from tenor and alarm. A policeconstable, who took the prisoner into custrdy, stated that v hen he told him what he was charged with he asked him who could prove it, and he afterwards said that his head was very bad. 4r. LmLEY, in his address to the jury for the defendant, said that the task that devolved upon him was, under any circumstances, a very painful and anxious one; but it was peculiarly so on the present occasion, because the unfortunate gentleman at the bar had formerly held Her Majesty's commission, and had for many years done his duty gal. lsntlv and faithfully to his country. He had served for 15 years at the Cape of Good Hope; and those who were acquaited with the climate of that region were aware what effect it had upon 'he constitution; and he believed he should have no difficulty in satisfying the jury that the hardships and service he had undergone had unsettled the mind of the unfortunate gentleman at the bar, and that he was therefore not responsible for the act he had committed. While the learned counsel was addressing the jury the defendant exclaimed with great vehemence that he objected to what he was stating, and declared that his reason was not in any way affected. He then proceeded in the most incoherent and violent strain, declaring that he bad seen all the wonders of the world, and that he had seen hell dragged up by the roots. The present charge, he said, was got up against him by the Ronman Catholies, because they knew that he was a Protestant, and that he was determined to support his religion. Mr. Justice EP.nE suggested that it would probably be the best course at once to proceed to lay some evidence before the jury as to tbe state of mind of the defendant Mtr. W. Baker, a medlei gentleman living at Norwood, was then examined, and he stated that he had known the defendant and his family for several years, and, from conversations he had had with him and other circumstances, he had formed the opinion that he was decidedly of unsound mind. Mr. John Keene, the governor of Horsemonger-lane Gaol, deposed that the defendant came into his custody on the 20th of March, and had been under his observation ever since. From what he had seen of him and his conduct since he had been inthe prison he had no hesitation in expressing his opinion that he was a madman. A certificate of Mr. Harris, the surgeon of the prison, to the same effect, was also put in. Mr. Justice ERnE then addressed the jury, and said that where an offence of this serious character had been commnitted, and the defence set up was that the party accused was not in such a state of mind as to be criminally responsible, it was very essential for the interest of the public that such a defence should be watched very narrowly. The jury, however, in the p resent case, had heard the evidence adduced in behalf of the defendant, and had had an opportunity also of observing the demeanour and conduct of the defendant himself while the tsial was going on; and, although, undoubtedly, it had happened that cunning persons had simulated madness, in order that they might escape the consequences of the acts they had committed, yet he must say that he could see no ground for supposing that that was the case in the present instance; but, on the contrary, it appeared to him that the defendant was clearly of unsound mind, and if the jury entertained the same opinion it would be their duty to acquit him on that ground. The jury at once returned a verdict of Yot Guilty, on the ground of insanity, and the prisoner was ordered to be detained during Her Majesty's pleasure. When this order had been given the prisoner became very violent, and declared he would not be locked up any longer, and it w as with some difficulty that he was removed from the dock. CrVIL SIDE. It has been arranged by the Lord Chief Baron that all the special jury cases are to be placed on the list in his court, and taken in their order on Thursday morning. The whole of the remaining common jury cases will be transferred to the Crown Court this (Thursday) morning, and a list will be made out for each day, in order to obviate the necessity of parties attending with their witnesses every day when there is no chance of their cases being reached.
OX-FORD CrRGMJ1 GLOCESTER AUGUST 6. VIL COURT.-(Before Mr. Baron ALDERSON ancd a Common Jury.) EFN-ERIS V. E'ranis. Mr. Powell andI Mr. Sawy7er appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Gray for the defendant. This was an action of ejectment brought to recover pos session of a sma31 cottage, valued at 401. The plaintiff and defendant were two brothers, Eons of James and Sarah Everis. The property originally belonged to the mother but, in the language of an old witness, she took the waggoner to the house, and married him. The old people remained in the occupation of the cottage till then- death, the father dying in 1851, and the mother in the present year. The two brothers then began to quarrel about the cottage, the plaintiff claiming it as heir-at-law, and the defendant asserting his right to it under a deed of gift executed by the father and mother. Of conrse the cae soon got into thehands of the lawyers, and as the title to the property was in question the decision was reserved for the honour, or disgrace, of sitar pirius t The p laintiff having proved his title as heir at ]aw, M9r. GRAY said the defendant wished him to state to the Court that he claimed the cottage under a deed executed by both the old people in the year 1848. The defendant had supported his parents when they were unable to do anything for themselves, and, with his wife, lved in the house with them for several years, and when they died he paid their funeral expenses. He had also paid some of their debts, and it was in consideration of his having agreed to do these things the deed was executed. Mr. Baron ArEDEpSON said the deed was not executed so as to pass a married woman's property. He was of opinion the deed was no defence. Mr. GRAY said he could not say that it was. The deed had notbeen prepared by an attorney, but by a village schoolmaster. The jury then found a verdict for the plaintiff. (Before a S'Pecial Jury.) DEGG (ADUSNm- ATmIX) V. THE MIIDLAND RAILWAY Co0PANY. Mr. Serjeant Pisott and Mr. Skinner appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Seating, Q.C., and mr. Dowdeswell for the defendants. The plaintiff in this action, Caroline Degg, was the admV nistratrix of her deceased husband, James Degg, and she sued the Midland ilnway Company to recover damages for the death of her husband, which took place on the 25th of October, 1855, by reason of the negligence of the defendants' servants in driving some carriages against a truck which killed the deceased. The action was tried at the last Glocester assizes, when the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff with 250?. damhages; but, as the- plaintiff in her eclaration had only claimed 2001., the verdict was entered for that amount. Subsequently a new trial was granted by the Court of Exchequer, on the terms that the plintiff should be allowed to amend her declaration, by raising her claim of dalnages to 250I., and that the defendants should he allowed to put anotherplea onthe record, to the effect that the deceased was volunatarily aistiaig t,he servants of the company in - moving a tuck on a turntable, anid that the servants of the company, by whose negligence the damago was aUeged to have accrue , were persons of ordinary care and sldll, and competent to move the trucks along the railway, and that tho negligence com lained of was wholly unauthorized -by the. company We do not thbik it necessary to. repeat the evidence,which was necessarilymuch the same as that given on the previous trial. It will be sufficient to state that on the day in question the deceased, who was in the employ of the Messrs. Pickford, was engaged in unloading a truck on a siding by the Midland Railway. Near him there was a turntable, where some men were engaged in moving'a truck. On the sidint 'there were some loaded waggons, and nlso soine empty waggons, with a small space- between them. When the men were moving the truck on thc turntable the deceased, thinking that the three men engaged in that operation wanted some. assistance, volunteered his aid and jumped down to lend a hand. While engaged in this operation an engine was brought into the siding by a man named Ashley. The eng-ine ran against the carriages, and, as there was no one to warn the men at the turntable, the engine drove the carages one against another until they knocked against the truck on the tunitable, and jambed the deceased between the buffer and the wall. He was kept in that frightful position for some little time, uintil the carriages could be removed; and when that was done the deceased was taken away to a hospital. and died the same night of the injuries which he had received. The negligenrerelied on by the plaintiff was that of the man Ahley. who was foreman of the porter;, but who was app)inted on the day in qaestion to act in the capacity of " sbunter," in the stead of the man who usually performed 'he duties of that office, but who was at the time in ihe hospital; and the main issue raised by the special plea was, whether Ashley was a man of ordinary care and skill and competent to nmove the trucks. ie 'was not a "shunter,"' though be had sometimes acted in that capacity, and it was stated that he did not give the usual signal by the whitle, though this was denied bi the defendants' witnesses. M£r. Baron ALDERxso sunmmed up the evidence, and leib it to the jury to say-first, whether the accident was caased by negligence on the part of any of the defendants' servants; and, secondly, whether the man Ashley and the engineer were persons of ordinary skill and care, and comptent to move the carriages on the line. Iis Lordsip told the jury that if they found the second question in the affirmative they ought to fnd for the defendants on the secondlissue, even though the defendant servants, on the particularoccasion, were guilty of negligence. The jury retired to consider their verdict, and were absent some tune; on their return into court they found the first question for the plaintiff, and the second for the defendants. Tne verdict was then entered for the plaintiff, with 2.01. damages, on the first issue, and conditionally on the second issue, there being a demurrer to the second plea to be determined. The learned B.ARwo also gave the defendants leave to move to enter the verdict in their favour on the first issue raised by "1 not guilty, " if the Court should be of opinion that the facts stated in the special plea constituted a good defence on " not guilty." CsEnNAAL CouRT.-(Before Ar. Ju.tice WriGoTn N.) Ann Alien, aged 46, and described as a nurse, was charged with the manslaughter of an infant child, named MaryEladlcy, at Berkeley, on the 80th of May last. Mr. Powell appeaTed for the prosecution; Mr. Serjeant Thomas defended the prisoner. F It appeared in evidence that a young girl, named Mary H3adley, who stated she was at the present time between 18 and 19 years of age, was in November last delivered of an illegitimate child. The child was born on the 28th of November. The apothecary who attended at the delivery was enable to travel to the assizes from illness, but his dewesition was read; and from that it appeared that the child was about a seven months' child. It was, however, a healthy one; and while it continued at the mothers breast it tbrived. After six weeks the mother wished to get a situation, and placed it with the prisoner, who was a nurse at Berkeley, to brng it up by hand, and engaged to pay her 3s. a-week. The child was fed on biscuits, &c., but it began to waste away, and on the 7th of Aprilthe prisoner sent for the apothecary who had attended the mother. The doctor found the child suffering from pain and constipation of the bowels, and severe indigestion. le prescribed anedicine, and directed the prisoner to change the food, but he did not continue his attendance after the 21st of April. From that time the child continued to got more emaciated until the 22d of May, w hen it was removed and placed under the care of another nurse. For a few days it seemed to take its food well, and to he improving, but on the 29th ef May it threw up its food, and died the next day. On a post nzostemn examination it ap,ceared that there was enlargement of the mesenterie glands, and other disease, which the docter who made the examination attributed to defeCtive nutrition, and in another part of his deposition to enlargement of the mesenterie glands, caused by cold. Similar evidence was given by a young surgeon who was examined as a witness, and who gave it as the result of his experience that a seven or eight months' child had nearly as good a chance of thriving as a nine months' child- and that children brought up by hand and fed on cows' milk thrive at Berkeley at least as well as those who enjoyed the food provided by nature at the mothers breast. The prisoner had alwaysappeared to be kind and attentive to the child. A witness was called to give hera good character, but the right witness did not answer. By some mistake the prisoner's daughter, a very healthy-looking young woman, stepped into the box, holdin a bounciag child in her arms. Shestated thatthe child hadbeen from itsbirthunderthe prisonor's care; and thus the child was inadvertently '- put in evidence." Mr. Serjeant Thozaas addressed the jury for the prisoner at someilength, andurged that there was no pretence for making the charge. MIr. Justice WGae1nwcAX, in summing up the evidence, observed that some of the statements made by the surgeon appeared rather strange to unprofessional people. He (the learned Judge) had always understood that children would sometimes die if brought up by hand; and that it was sometimes necessary, in order to save their lives, to obtain a wet nurse. The jury must exercise their common sense on the case, and not convict the prisoner unless they thought she had, by her gross negligence, caused the death of the child. The jury, without the least hesitation, found the prisoner RPot Guilty, and she was discharced.
POLICE. MIA2rSION-11OtSE.-John Campbell was charged by Mr. W. Foy, shipbroker of Crutchedfriars, with having been in his house with intent to commit a robbery. The complainant said,-I heard a noise in the house, and I saw the prisoner on the landing-place of the stairs vwith a beg in his hand. When I askced him what he wanted he said, in a very inmpudent manner, that e came to serve a writ upon Mrs. Robertson. He refused to show sie the <~f.t. Iloberts is the name of our housekeeper, and she p ent at the time, and told him her name, Wuon 'which he said that she was not the person he wanted. 'e positively refused afterwards to give us any account of himself whatever, except that he was a gardener, and that he had been living w,ith M1r. May, of Dulwich. Sir P. LunsiE (to the prisoner).-If you think you can impose upon us by s7nh a statement you ace mistaken. You must let us know 'who you are, and what business you had in this gentleman's house. The Prisoner.-I don't wish to say. I bave been living at Dulwich, and I have been lodging at the White llorse, in Fetter-lane, of late; and I pick up a shilling or two here and there, you see, Sir. Sir P. LAURiE having in vain given the prisoner an oppoxtunity of sbowing that he had some reasonable excuse for being in the house, into which he had walk-ed with a bag capable of containing a large amount of property, said the case should be disposed of without giving peopIe any more trouble about it, and sentenced him to imprisonment for 21 days as a rogue and vagabond. The Prisoner.-Well, I assure you that I am an honest man. Committed. Peter Theodore Gineson, a Swede, was charged with having stolen a watch and money the property of Mr. Zachari. The prisoner was remanded till Saturday. Mary Simmons, who was a few days ago charged vith having robbed IWr. Matthias, a merchant, of two ol. notes and other property, in Walbrook, 'was committed for triaL GusnnnALc.-George Thomas and Henry Hillyer, two respectably-dressed young men, described as clerks, but who refued to give their addresses, were chargedwith stealing a bundle of posted letters from the receiving-house for letters in King-street, Covent-garden, on the 21st of July, and also on suspicion of stealing a bundle of posted letters from the receivsng-house for letters, 107, Holborn-hill, on the 1st of October, 1855, the property of the Postmaster-General. Mr. Peacock, the solicitor to the Post-office, conducted the prosecution. Rrl Peacock said,-The prisoners are cha-rged with stealing letters from the Post-office, and the circumstances are of a peculiar character. We have had numerous complaints for some time past from our receiving-houses, that when the letters are done up and lying on the counter ready to be fetched away persons rush into the shop, seize the packets of posted letters, rush out again, and make off. The case that I shaU proceed with to-day is a robbery of ihis description, which was committed at the receiving-house in - King-street, Covent-garden, on the 21st of July last. The letters were made up to be despatched at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, when somo Derson rushed into the shop, and stole the whole of the letters. Among them was ono which contained a check drawn by Mr. John C. Stephenson on Messrs. Coutts for 70'. 17s. 6d., and as soon as the robbery was perpetrated the owner of the receiving-house gave notice to Mr. Stephenson, 'who stopped the payment of the check. On the following dav it was presented by a youth named Frederick i3avidson, but Messrs. Coutts gave it back to him, refusing-to cash it. He had met the prisoner Thomas, and received the cheek from him under tho promise of getting him a situation. On being refused cash for the check he went to Whitehall-place to meet Thormas by appointment, and was followed by Thaie, a detective officer. Thomas did not keep his appointment, and had not since been seen until yesterday afternoon, when Davidson and Thain met him in Fleetstreet, and took him into custody. It was his intention to ask for a remand, as he believed he had a clue to the other robberies that had been committed. Frederick Davidson said,- I live with my father at 8, York-terrace, Albany-road, CamberwelL On Tuesday, the 22d of Jil,-I.was walking down Charing-crors,¢and just as I reached Buckingham-court I saw the prisog'pr-Thomas. I knew him by sight, as I' had several- times seen him before in the Albany-road. He looked at me as I passed him, and -when I reached the Admiralty gates be touched me on the shoulder, and asked me if I wanted a situaticn. I said, yes, and he asked me if I had been out 'cefore. I said, yes, I had been at Kelly's,4 is-sBoswellccutt He askedineif be coudd trust meto ea eaclheOi' for him at Coutte's bank, and I said yes. BE' ten asked mieif-I-knew where Coutts's bank was, towbichl I replied& that I knew it very well. He then put the cbepk into my waistcoat-pocket, ad said, " Make haste, and s it sbort" He said "short" meant notes. He told mse when I re' turned I was to ake it over the wa and hepointed to tlhS second door in Whitehall-place. He lsda, if he wer not there his governor, Mr. obetso>n, would be there; He said if I wOuld makl haste he 'would get me a situation, and would speak to Mr. Robertson as if he had known me a long wlule. I then left him and went towards Coutt,'s bank. On the way I looked at.tho pa4cr he had put in mv pocket to see if it was a check, and found that it was, and Was drawn for 761. i7s. 6L on Coetts's. This produced is the same he gave me. I presented the check to one of the clerks, who questioned me, and then -wrote on the ahock that it would not be paid. I put the check intO my pocket and went to Whitehall-place, but the prisonor Thomas wavs not there. I then went to severil houses to find out Mr. Robertson, and while doing so I asked Thain if he knew where hEr. Robertson lived. We both made inquiry, and found he had beendead eight years. I had never spoken to the prisoner before, nor has he spoken to me. I know him only by sight, and do not know his name, nor where he lives. I gave the officer Thain a full description of the prisoner as far as I could recollect. I bave been for the last 10 or 11 days walking about London with the officer, trying to meet with this man, but saw nothing of him until yesteidaiy afteroon. Yesterday I was stan ing with Thain at the corner of Bridge-street and Fleet-street, when I saw the prisoners walk past together. They went into an ice-shop, and remained therefor a few' 3ninutes. ThomasLtlhen rame out, and walked towvards Termple-bar, wvhile Hillyer, who caine out directly after. went towards St. Paul's; but suddenly he turnea round and joined Thomas, anidwhile they were talking Thain took them into custody, When Thomas was walking towards me I think he knew me, because he stopped all at once, andthenw.as joinedbythe otherprisoner. have no doubt that he is the same person who gave me the check. Cross-examined by Thomas.-It is abont six months since I saw you in the Albany-road. I know you by your face, You came out of the shop first. I do not know where you were going to, for I was looling into the slop, as I was motioned to keep back. Alderman CIULaLs.- iMyer, do you wish to ask this wvitness any questions? Hillyer.-No, Sir; his evidence does not affect me ab all. Cbarles Thain, detective officer 19, corroborated the eater portion of the last witness's statement, and addedI have reason to believe that, if aremaud be granted, I shall be able to prove Hillyer to be implicated in these robbeiries. Michael Haydon, detective officer 21, said-I searched the prisoner HMllyer at the station, and found on him a pocke-book. a have been for some time engaged in malininquiries regarding the robberies that have been comniittea at the poat-offices, and in the book that I teok from Hiyer I foana entlea that relate to one of those robberies. He said that book was his, and contained only a few private memorandinna of his owln. On the application of Mr. Peacock, the prisoners were remanded. Bo-r.sTcer.-A cabman named Spencer -was summoned at the instance of the police for refusing to prodoce his badge. He was defended by Mr. Jesse, barrister. Policeman Davis, A 231, deposed, that at 11 o'clock in the forenoon of the '26th of July the defendant drove into the park by the Stable-yard-gate. Witness stopped him, and, as his badge was concealed by his coat, asked to see it. The prisoner suade no answer, but pointed to the gentleman us the cab. Thab gentleman said, "If you have anything to say, policeman, address yourself to me." Witness repled that the cab could not go that way unless the gentleman had a pass-ticket; they must go back. The gentleman desired defendant nob to mind the policeman, but to drive on, which he did. Cross e-aminied.-The first vords addressed by witness to the defendant wera, "Where is your metal ticket?" He was sure he used the word " metal." Norris, the gatekeeper, corroborated. Mr. Jesse said that in fact the occurence arose from a disputed right of way, and these proceedings were only taken to enforce the sight of the police to order a carriage back. He denied that right, and demanded proof of any instruetions to them to act as they had done. Mr. HEsnry said it was really not material. Defendant was summoned for refusing to show his badge, which he was bound to do whenever required, and which the police wvere enititled to require at any time or ulace. But, though it did not affect the case, he might snention that the right to exclude carriages from the park had been repeatedly settled, and the instructions to do so with aU hackney carriages had been proved in this court. Mr. Jesse bowed to the magistrate's opinion, based as it was on judicial knowledge. At all events, the gentleman, Captain Belson, had been under an inpression that the nolice were notjustified in excludinghimfrointhepark, andthat the park-keepers alone coald properly interfere. He was also under the impression that, as he hire.d the cab by t'he w.eek, it was a private carriage. HIe (MIr. Jesse) was aware, however, that to make it. a private carriage the plates oug ht to be taken off-a point which Captain Belson overlooked. Bnt the point on which he rested the defence was that therehadbeenno refusal to showthe ticket. When the polceman said "Show me your ticket," defendant understood him to mean the green pass ticket which entitles some rivileged persons to go that way in public carriages, and V.etlerefore referred the constable to the passeuger. In support of this he pointed ont that Norris, in corroborating Davis, did not use the same word, "metal ticket" but stated that Davis asked defendant for his "ticket." Mr. Jesse at first proposed to call Captain Belson, but evetntally decided on leaving the case to his wrorsihip as5 it stood. Inl reply to a suggestion fromn his worship the learned counsel admitted that virtually he appeared on the paLrt of Captain Belson. MIr. HENRY had no doubt that Davis asked for the "metal ticket.". At the same time it was not necessary, as the act spoke of a " ticket" only, and every cabman knew when lie was asked for " his" ticket that it meant the ticket ho wore round his neck, and not a paper ticket for some otherpurpose, in possession of his fare. It was clear that defendant acted under the impression that he would be indemniflied by Captain Belson. However, it was not a case for a heavy fine; he would mitigate the penalty to 10s. The fine was paid. Wonssisr-srsuE-r-Geore Fry, a tall, smart-looking young fellow, was charged %efore bmr. D'ElscousR with assault and highway robbery. M1r. Thomas Campion, an accountant, residing at Barcssaterrace. HIackney, was passing through Church-street, Shoreditch, at 9 o'dcck that morning, when he was alarmed by aloudexplosion close to him, proceedingfrom an adjoi2ing oilshop, where it appeared some gunpowder had taken fire. A large crowd almost instantly collected, and the writness stayed a short time to ascertainl whether any persons were injured, when a slight confusion suddenly occurred, and he missed his gold pin from his scarf. A porter named Good happened to be standing near the prosecutor at the time, and saw the prisoner walkup to him, coolly and cleverly take the pin out of the scarf, and walk awvy with it. He followed and caught him, and on taking him back to the prosecutor he was given in charge and conveyed to the station, on reaching which Good apprised the acting inspector of whathe had witnessed, and the instant the last word had escaped his lips the prisoner quietly moved up to hin and dealt hin such a heavy blow with his fist in the face that his right eye was cut open at the eyebrow, both eyes were thoroughly blackened, one of them so injured that he could not see with it, and he appeared in the witness-box, with his head in a bandage. The neckpin was produced by a gunmaLer named Lynch, who saw the prisoner fling it away; and Charles Ames, who was formesly in the police force, but has now left it, deposed to being present at the Central Criminal Court about five years ago, when he saw the prisoner tried and convicted for felony. The p-isoner declared he k-new nothing whatever of the stolen property, and had not the slightest recollection of the conviction deposed to; but he was fully committed for trial. SouTvsvARw.-Mr. Eleholas Rowe, an army and navy contractor, whose offices are at No. 51, Baukside, Southwark, was charged with the abduction of Eliza Bradshaw, 14years of age, the daughter of Williqm Bradshaw, beershop-keeper, No. 62, Red Cross-street, Boroung LHe was also charged with committing a criminal assault upon her, but that charge was abandoned. M1r. Solomon appeared for the prosecution, and Mr. Binns for the prisoner, who is a married man, about 353years of agze. Mgr. Solomon said that the charge was one of a very serious nature against the prisoner, the commiission of which had destroyed the happiness of a very respectable! family. For the last 12 snonths he had been in the habit of visiting r. Bradshaw's house, and, knowving him to be a person in a good station of life, he wras introduced to his! wife and family. On Saturday night he was at his client's house, as usual, when he sent the complainant to purchase something for him at a butcher's in the neighbourhood. Soon after she left her father's house the prisoner followsed her, and nothingmoro was heard of her until Sunday afternoon, wben sbe was foumd in the I,ambeth-road, and then it was discovered that the prisonerhad taken her awyfrom home, conveyed her to a brothel in Exeter-street end there slept with her until Sunday noon. Information was given to the police, and the prisoner was sought after, but it was not until Tuesday night that he could be found, when the father of the girl gave him into custody. The charge then made he (Mr. Solomon) did not think he could sustain; therefore he abandoned at, and charged him with abduction as he had taken her away from home without her fathers consent. Mr. ComBs asked Mr. Solomon under what act of Par- liament ne proceeded. Mr. Solomon replied.-The 9th George IV., cap. 31, sec. 20, which enacts that if any person shal unlawfully take, or cause to be tak-en, any unmarried girl, being under the age of 16 years, out oi the possession and ag,ainst the will of her fatherormother, or of any other person having the lawful care or charge of her, every such offender shall be guilty of a misfdemeanour, and, being convicted thereof, shall be liable to suffer such punishment, by fine or imprisonment, or by both, as the Court shall award. The mother was then called, and said,-I reside with my husband at 62, Red Cross-street, Borongh. We keep a beershop. My daughter; lhliza Bradshaw, will be 15 years of age on the 29th of next September. She has lived with us from. her birth, and was at hone up to Saturday night last. The prisoner was in the house on that night, and my husband was upstairs in the clubroom. Between 11. and 12 o'clock the prisoner sent my daughter to Beale's, the butcher's, in Queen-street, to purchase some meat for him. After she had gone a mirute ortwothe prisoner went out, and, having some suspicion, 1 sent out a young man to see whether she went to the buteher's. Finding she did not, and that neither of them returned, I -informed--my husband, who went in search of them, but could not flnTd them. On ;un. day aftersoon I discovered my daughter at the prisoner's house in Lambath, when she told me that the prisoner had seduced her, after giving her spirits and some wlie. My husband then went in ouest of the prisoner, whom he did not find until Tuesday,wwhen he was given into. custody.; My daughter never left our house before at ndght time. Mr. Solomwon.-Dlid she leave on Saturday night with your consent? Witness.-Certainly not, Sir. Mr. Binns.-HIavo you not allowed her to go out with the prisoner on several occasione? Witnezs,-I alowedher to go with bmnto the Cryatol Palace, when le seid that he-belonged to the treema,ons ahd odd Fellows, and he *as hound to Protect a feale. Besides, heis a married man.

I know him to ho a married man. On S.tur day night, about half.past 11 o'clock,-he aslked mne to go to the butcher's annd purhae him some nimat for his Sunday's dinner,as his wife asout of-town.

That was about three weeks ago, and the only time Mr. Co3fIE.-Where did that talke place ? Witness.-Iu my father's house. My father was not at home then, Mr. Bincs.-Have you not been with him in a tavern at Norwood until a late hour at night? Witness.-Yes, Sir. That was about four mnouths ago, and my father conEented. Nothing, improper took place then. Wlliam Bradshaw- sworn.-The last witness is my daughter, and she will be 15 years of age next month. The prisoner has visited my house about 12 mornths, and in consequence of our intimacy has taken advantage of my daughter and ruined her. - Mr. Solomon.-Has she ever gone out with him with your consent? Witness.-No, Sir; I have always objected toit, as he is a married man. I went with him and my daughter last IEpsom races. Ihave heard tha she went out with him and had her portrait taken. I was extremely angry with her when I heard of it. Mr. Solomon.-What do vou know of her leaving home on Saturday last ? Witnes.-I was upstairs whea she went out, and as soon as mv wife told me the prisoner hadfollowed her out, and that they had not returned, I went in search of her, but could gain no tidings of either. On the Sunday I fouud her at the prisoner's house, when she told me what had occurred. Mr. Binns.--Now, has not the prisoner given your daughter dresses, a bonnet, and some trinkets 7 Witness.-Yes, I believe he has; but I never wanted to see them. I have borrowed money from him, but it has been to pay bets of his contracting. Mr. Binms.-Now, has notyour daughter gone out several times with Mr. Rowe without your verbal consent ? Witness.-No, Sir. Mr. Binms.-Have you not made this charge against him to avoid a debt you owe him ? Witness.-No, Sir. If I owe him anything it is for bets he says he has made for me; but I don't acknowledge it. If I owe him anything I shall pay him soon. Mr. ComBaE.-Where does the prisoner live? Alr. Binns.-I am instructed to say that he resides at No. 10, lambeth-road, and that his counting-house is at No. 61, Bauk^side. He is a substantial person. Mr. COMrsE.-After what I have heard in this case I am of opinion that it is one for the sessions; consequently the prosecutrix must go there. Mr. Solomon.-If you intend sending the case to the sessions I shall ask your worshaip not to liberate him unless he puts in good baiL Mr. Coenu.-Certainly. He must be bound in the sum of SOI. and find two sureties in 401. each to appear at the next Old Bailey sessions. The prisoner was then removed by the gaoler, but just before the close of the court bail was put in, and he was liberated until the sessions, the 18tb of the present month.

-- C(AYLr3 1?BVOLUTIONS OF 184.- I~~~~~~~~~~~~ _ 1 th-Re two voluimcs were a mnire gr&usm of the 'ePeVzs of the last revolutionary epoch, they would be' uaeful andd welcome. It may even be considered ztranga that they were not forestalled by some publication of a similar nature. The sudden and all but universal overthrow of European Governments, the confusion which ensued, the rash experiments endin generaUy in the re-establishment of authority, th inal clearing of the political atmosphere by a great EuropeauNwr, the dramatic incidents and the unity of the theme combined, constitute a temptation most attraetive to the ambition of literary men. Mr. Cayley, however, is the first who, as far as we are aware, has perceived that so capital a subject was to let ; and accordingly he has produced a book which is in many respects good, which miight unnestionably have been betl;er, but whicb, so far from having been yet superseded, has not at present even a competitor. We have not undertaken to verify half the datfa Mr. Cayley has collected acd employed in the history of so many European convulsions; but as far as our examination has gone we have found his work generally accurate. Indepen dently of its accuracy, itis valuable for two qualities swhich are more pouvely personal,-the sturdy common sense and pleas<ant humour of the author. Hfe has preserved many good stories which raig'ht otherwise have been forgotten after they had once amused us, and has turned them to illustrative uses. He appears to have a talent for giving us the ridiculous aspect of historical facts-an aspect which is by no means the least interesting or the least instructive. In short, his book is useful because it is so amusing, because it has the rare distinction of being a lively abridgement of a history which people rill read before they place it upon their shelves. It is also in the main practical and sound; but we must qualify this last praise with considerable exceptions. - Mr. Cayley maintains the position admitted by most Englishmen, and, if not admitted, corroborated beyond doubt by the very examples he is discussing, -that an aristocracy is a main element of security in a State. It has sympathies with the throne and the people, and it stands between them as a mediator, favouring liberty yet maintaining order, and is therefore one of the best guarantees against revolution. So far we are agreed, as also that the class of squires, or smaller landed proprietors, is a main element of an aristocracy. But to rely, as Mxr. Cayley does, so mainly, if not exclusively, on his acred squadrons, to parade them so incessantly, to make them the turning force in nearly all questions, is not complimentary to law, letters, arts, commerce, and religion, and is not true, for it is the fraction or exaggeration of a truth. It militates against his book by attaching a party significance to facts which have wider bearings in a more comprehensive scheme of philosophy, and it excites the antagonism of the reader to much which he would otherwise assent to, by suggesting to his mind the impression that Mr. Cayley fights for a party victory. This is the common source from which Mlr. Cayley's errors spring, and therefore at the outset we mark it thus emphaticaUy. WVe ascribe to this source his undue disparagement of the material elements of civilization possessed by our continental neighbours, and of which he strangely underrates the value on page 19 of his second volume. To this, also, we refer his supercilious reflections on the capacities and stdf es of literary men a few pages further on. Hence his extravagant statement on page 269 that the Government clerks in the London offices have " fortunately not succeeded as yet in aggrandizing themselves on the entire ruin of ouir system, though they have made considerable approaches to it." Hence the exclusive spirit in which the middle classes are denounced by him on page 272. And hence the more conspicuous and discreditable imputation that " assassination is here recommended by unadorned eloquence." There can be no doubt as to the meanitg of this statement or as to its injustice; nor after the author of the imputation had himself advisedly withdrawn it had AMr. Cayley a right t6 utter it afresh. These are blemishes which we are compelled to point out as detracting from the value of his otherwise sensible observations. A better specimen of Mr. Cayley's philosophical mood is the following from his opening page:- "The first French revolution hasleft behind it in France, and in many parts of the continent, an unfortunate coincidence of circumstances and ideas, which renders and government difficult and all governments insecure. Mlan- awoke from the opinion which they had long practically entertained that they were the personal property of the pnnce on whose estates they happened to be born. They awoke from the delusion that they existed for his benefit alone; but they fell into the equally mistaken idea that oplular will was the safest guide for civil government. They forgot that the growth of a nation is slower than that of a man, that the ages in the life of a nation are of longer duration, that a course of policy must be longer persevered with innational than in individual existence to render it successful, and that popular will is more readily guided by immediate than by remote objects, and is consequently wanting in the consistency which is necessary to the prudent management of the interests of a State. From the one error, that these interests should be conducted alone at the dictation of the Sovereign, or a knot of confidential advisers by whom he is surrounded, the reaction has -un into the equal fallacy that they can be well administered according to the momentary popular opinion. The latter error appears to be quite as great, more dangerous, and much more trouablesome than the former; with the one there was occasional consistency in policy, with the latter fuUly carried out there could seldom be any. An indifferent scheme well acted on may be at least less hurtful than a series of policies good, bad, or indifferent, alternately adopted and rejected, as a succession of experiments. " The former error, however disastrous had been its con. sequences during that stormy period, was too flattering to the vanity of mankind to be easily eradicated. The common sense of the nation had under Napoleon submitted itself to a powerful and rigorous despotism, and after the peace to the restoration of theBourbon rule, to save it from anarchybut the people had been taught to imagine that they could think for themselves politicaly, and had not taken the trouble practically to learn how to do so." The estimate of the causes of the Ilst French revolution is clear and succinct. That consequence of the first revolution,the absence of an aristocracy, is in Mr. Cayley's eyes the first and paramount cause of the revolutions which have followed. There is no one to direct and combine the poorer proprietors and the peasantry of France, and the latter have therefore less than their share of political influence. Though " more numerous, more important, and really more powerful than the urban populace and the bourgeois class, from want of combination they have been of little weight in the political scale." The shopkeepers of the towns possess the influence of an aristocracy, and are in some senses its substitutes. " It is not surprising, therefore, that it should have been the object of the French Government to gain the confidence, to extend the influence of the botrgeoisie, and to place political power in their grasp; for, even though they hav7e in all ages and countries showvn themnselves to be unworthy of the charge" (thus summarily does Mr. Cayley dismiss the Flemish, German, and Italian municipalities) " yet from'the peculiar circumstances of France they were the only class who it was thought could be so intrusted." They failed, however, from whim and covwardice, of which they are now repentant and ashamed. The difficulty of governing France through them, or through any body, is, however, due partly to its moral laxity, to the vanity of its people, to the nmber of its liberated convicts and of its ille,itimate children. But the absence of a real aristocracy, w;hich casts on the bourgeois a duty he is unequal to perform, also leaves the functionaries of the State uncontrolled, supreme over all beneath them, yet slaves of the central power, which they follow in its vacillatiors as often as it changes hands. W7hoever gets possession of Paris, as Mr. Cayley says truly, gets possession of every functionary from one end of ance to the other; and thus the absence of an aristocracy renders a revolution an easy and simple transaction, whenever there is a sufficient accumulahion of combustible mnaterials in the metropolis. Iramce, as we understand Mr. Cayley, was predisposed to revolutions by this deficiency, and yet it undlerwent its greatest revohItion, according to his statement, before this deficiency was created. Here is the weak point of his position, which he will not be able to make good without correcting his nis- apprehension of facts by the recent work of De Tocqueville. As to the immediate inducements to the catastrophe of 1848, we believe, however, that he is right in ascribing- blt3mdre ntec o the seret societies. ut amoderateinfluence to "After all, however, the secret political societies were not really sO dangerous to the Government as might have been expected.

PerhrP3 a little temporary courage and inebriated, heroics might a the reset ; bat as th-se fumes evaporated before 3-, ' they were more fraught with leadache than t to the State. Nevertheless they were always 'onsp;, as it seemsn with the perfect acquiesence , the powers that were, iwho every now and then P teaed a eow ' pour en- COlR' (tux autrcs.' There Was always a sort of circulation of vinoon patrioti undergoing shorter or longer peMiods of imprisonment, whice came to be a regular change, and was perhaps regarded by them as a periodic relaxation. But, though these societies might have no very directly important effect, they could not be otherwise than hotbeds of sedition; and thouglh their regular members were only the idle and dissipated in times of public prosperity, yet the revolutionary traditions of 1789 were necessarily kept alive; and in periods of distress, theories which promised so much were naturally adopted by the workman, unemployed and hungry, though when he was full and occupied he might occasionally recollect that they had proved miserably deficient in performance. Nor was it republicanism and democracy alone that were hatched in these nests; Socialism and Communism-in short, whatever ended in -ism, provided it were of a Kind to overturn society, was equally acceptable." Mr. Cayley describes the relations of their chiefs and subordinates, the Caussidi&res, Chenus, and Delahoddes, &G., but concludes his account of them as foUlows *. t" Enough has been said to show that these secret societies were in no w-ay really formidable. Their numbers were about, Soei6t6 des Saissons, 600 ; Comamunistes d'Action and La Societe Dissidente, e00; and Icarians of M. Cabot, 400; nmaliig utp t-he Parisian COnspirators te the number of 1,500, or thereaboults. It is perfectly clear that this insinificant set of ragamnuffins, wvithout order or discpline, had little or nothing to do with the revolution of lFebruasry." There wvere not, according to the estimation of Delahodde, above 20,000 adherents of the Republican cause all over France, and not above 5,000 in Paris, when the revolution broke out. The real and proximate cause of the outbreak m-as hunger, caused, says Tr. Cayley, by the conunercoal crisis in England, the failure of crops, and the deficiency of employment, WVe can corroborate MIr. Cayley's view from the comparative tables of thepriceof bread in Paris from the yearl815, and which were published two or three years ago. These exhibit the attainmentof a price in 1847 higher than that in any year subsequent to the Cong,ress of Vienna, and only approached by the prices of 1829, which wve may fairly assumne helped to produce the revolution of 1830. If Louis Ehilippe came to the, throne by means of a dear loaf it was a natusral compensation that he should be ousted by a denrer. Mr. Cayley blames his MAinisters for not admitting the distress, and for not meeting it by palliatives, financial or other. They consulted their apparent and not their real interest in withholding this admission, and the event disappointed them. But it did not the less disappoint their party competitors. The Reformers wanted to turn out the Mlinistry, and they succeeded in overturning the monarchy. Louis Philippe was set aside like any other chef de bureau, and the demagogues who hoped to rule France by a Paris mob succeeded in getting themselves a moreresolute master. MIr. Cayley does not omit the more ludicrous or horrible incidents of the time. The simulation of a General officer of the National Guard by Dubourg, by means of the properties of a masquerade shop, the attempt of the young lady patriots to embrace Lamartine, the roasting of the soldiers at the Chateau d'Eau, and the thieves' saturnalia at the Tuileries, are commemorated in lively descriptions, and we are happy to find that credit is rendered to the splendid talents and indispensable exertions of Lamartine, vhose name and eloquence had effects " than which eloquence has produced none greater, in guiding men and pacifying multitudes." "X3. de Lamartine well deserved not only their gratitude, but that of all Europe. For though it iz possible that he might at an earlier period have suacceeded in preventing the revolution, as he himself appears to imagine, yet that is very doubtfuil; at any rate, ho had no direct reason to interfere. But when affairs had gone so far that there was imminent danger of utter destruction to the bulwarks of civilation; when the conflict of passions liad lashed to fury the souls of the combatants; wvhen terror and bloodshed appeared, arter half a centu!ry of intermission, about to reassuine their sway in the capital of France, he then accomplished that which no other man in Europe could have effected. e restrained the infuiated populace by the charm of his wondrous eloquence. He calmed the turbulent by flattering their vanity, their ruling passion. He prevented massacre at home and aggression abroad. "That the peace of Europe was not broken by France, and that the world was not plunged into a war of a quarter of a century's duration; is tobhe greatly attributed to his prutdence, his humlanity, his eloquence, his courage, and his patriotism. Had it been otherwisce; had France attacked urope ihad this country taken (as under the circumstances it would have done) the side against her, is it possilble that there could have been now- between the two coantries the cordial understanding which has sent their troops and fleets together to fight for the maintenance of the peace of Europe 9 Without ignoring the faults of M. de Lamartine, hadhis course been then less prudent, this is what neither the will nor the policy of Louis Napoleon could have subsequently accomplished; and Europe owes him a deep debt of gratitude; which it will forget-nay, has probably already forgotten." Mr. Cayley carries his narrative of events in France up to the date of the marriage of the Emperor, and includes the coup d'etat, which he justHies ably as,an infraction of the letter, but as an adherence to the spirit of the French Constitation. Ile then proceeds to Italy, sketches its politics from the peace-to the election of Pio Nono, narrates the Pope's refonrs, the revolutions in the Italian States, the campaigns of Charles Albert, and the subsequent events up to the date of the French intervention and the Pope's restoration. Then he proceeds to Germany and describes all the chief revolutions there, the proceedings of the Fraukfort Parliament, the Schleswig-Holstein war and the contest between Austria and Hungary, and, lastly, turns to the united kingdom, to the irish rebellion, and to the Englsh revolution (that was to have been), and adds achapter which is a corollar of all that has preceded on the reasons why the united kingdom was not revolutionized in 1848 and 1849. He concludes with the subsequent general history of Europe down to the breaking out of the Russian war; and his two volumes thus filled comprise together about 700 pages. One of the best portions of the -whole is his comparison of education in England and Germany, and his indication of the revolutionary tendencies of the latter. " Brought up to the same class of ideas by a single clique of professors, each individual is one of a class alike in views or in the absence of them. Government havo created a monopoly of education in 'he hands of functionaries, and themselves suffer from the consequent scarcity of sense. The body of functionaries is constantly renewed and replenished by undergraduates of the German nniversities, the 'Burschenschaft,' as thev are called. The opinions of this class have ever since the formation of the Tugenbund, in 1808, for the purpose of expeling the French, beeen the means of leading publc opinion in Germany. From this class come all newspaper editors, professors, Ministers of State, literary men, taxgatherers, &c. How it came that a ciass so smaUl in numbers, in proportion to the rest of the population, shoulsd have such an enormous influence on public opinion isa matter for serious reflection. The German Governments, in order to support themselves, established a Government monopoly of education, hoping thus to control public opinion to their own advantage. They succeeded L controlling public opinion, but much to their own inconvenience. The body of students at the German Universities is by no means as numerous in proportion to the population as the body of students at the Scotch Universities is to the people of Scotland; whence comes it that the one has scared7the potentates and princes of the earth from their propriety, the other has no political influence whatever s "In Germany the members of the Universities are made a distinct class, exempt from ordinary laws and police. They are subject to different tribunals ; their own professors are their judges, and can imprison and expel. From them alone can educated labour be supplied; they only are eligible for office; they have become an 'simperium in impaerio ' are imbued with a distinct ' esprit de co,ps;' and look down very naturally on all who are not students. The student is called from his college, and set over men whom he looks on as a class different from his own; to administer laws which he never obeyed; to meddle with interests he does not understand; in short, he is put in a place to exercise his inexperienced halucinations on the world, instead of being put in the world to gain experience, and have his crude ideas and childish conceits corrected by attrition against the real hard business of life. " In Scotland, on the other hand, the student belongs to no distinct class. Education is free; he is under no special code of laws; he is not taught to consider himself as different from his neighbours; he is often an apprentice or youlmg farmer, following a course of lectures likely to be useful to hi in his business. If he misconducts himself he finds his ardent aspirations checked by the unpoetic policeman; he may find himself next morasg at the bar of justice with a corpany of drunken tinkers, invaders of private property, pilferers of ducks and chickens,and a host of petty delinquents; his position of student in no way alleviates or aggravatess this offence. He merely goes to the Unliversity to learn, because he can there learn what he wants more conveniently than elsewhere;* but he is at per fect liberty to go elsewvhere for his learning, if he can. Education is a free trade. There in no stereotyped opinion ready made for all comers. He may hear many derent views, and has to use his owvn brains to ascertain the tuth. He learns to think for himself, and independence of thougha implies that he is capable of thinkdng and forming conelusioZs from practical facts brought under his notice. Such a man is incapable of becoming a mere visionary. Ile is, educated as a man of businness. Ho merely belongs to the University because t-here is a gced market for educated labour; and he purchases his education in the best market, thand ise v,ousdeafvulshopoy,cluetrkor apprentice, or farmer And further, as to the quality of the German's c-e tion compared vith that obtained by the RngliAhman - "Real education is the formation and training of the mind. To train the mind requires hard, patient, and independent thinldng and work; the mere crude teaching a youth a bundle of facts which he acquires with no labour, and only retaining, neither digests nor assimilates, is no training at all; they noway nourish hisamind, but deposited there, are utterly as raw and undigested as he swallowed tbem. Hemaybeafuliman, but it is the fulaess of a bottle, which will pour out what has been previously poured in, wvhether vinegar or claret; he may be a convenient depository of other men's thou hts,-he may have sufficient capacityfor holdingthem,-buttto callsuchamaueducatedis a misuse of terms, and to trust men to his superintendence is a misuse of humanity; he plunges into the arena of politics, the sea of literature, or the fury of a revolution, unchecked by any glimmering suspicion of his own folly, and hurls thrones to the ground, sees the people masacred, and Enrope in conflagration, without feelng compunction or remorse; he is as insensitive as a bottle or a bag; take away what it is filled vwith, and what remains? I Compare such a person with a ioan educated in England. Yo doubt the man to begin with is different in his habits and vitality. The athletic, active, and hearty young English gentleman, brought np rtly in a public school and partly in the country sports of L's native county, is hardy and robust, capable of great bodily exertion, his whole constitution glowing with healthy vigour, his form erect, his frame like iron, his hand like a lady's, and his arm like a crowbar. The German-lazy, deficient in muscular energy, his bloodvessels haLf empty, neither exercising nor washing himself-isa fit receptacle for vapoumish huinours. If the Englishman has learned nothing else at the University, he has learned to know men and things; he has met other men, brought up in their families in different habits and opinions from his own; he is called on to defend his own, or he attacks his neighbour's; he lears that upon most subjects there are two or more ways of thinking. This fact alone induces him to use his own head to a certain extent. If he is not much better for such a course, at all events he is not made dangerous to his country by it." These specimens will sufficiently indicate the merits of TEr. Cayley's work, and we have already remarked upon the character of its defects. As a comprehensive verdict on the entire case it has important pretensions, though with obvious abatements, One of the latter is a consequence of Mr. Cayley's anticipation of his competitors. His work has appeared too soon to enable him to do full justice to himself or hissubject by avoiding crude conclusions. What the revolutions of 1848 have left behind theA we have yet to see, and years hence we shall see much more clearly. It ma too early to form a final judgment, wvhile wre are swfeeping up the fragments. MIr. Cayley's judgment in the meantime is interlocutory and unau.thoritative, but it is always clever and in many respects sagacious,
M MILITARY AND 21A VAL INTELLIGENCB. Major-General Sir W. F. Williams, Commandant of Woolwich, having deferred his intended visit to Nova Scotia, yesterday morning reassumed the command of the gaDison, Some detachments of non-commissioned officers and gunners of the Royal Artillery are under orders to sail from head-quarters, Woolwich, for Gibraltar, to increase the strength of the companies stationed there. The 4-gan paddle-wheel steamvessel Medusa, 312 horsepower, lately arrived from the Mediterranean station, was yesterday morning tak-en into the fitting basin at Woolwich to be again prepared for commission. The sailing transport Ayrshire, No. 196, 750 tons burden, arrived at Woolwich yesterday morning to discharge Ordnance stores and light goods from Balaklava. Two more experimental lS-inch mortars have been received at Woolwich from Messrs. Forrester's, of Liverpool. The 17th Lancers are distributed in no less tharn six different places in Ireland-viz., Limerick, Clonmel, Nenagh, Cahir, Fethard, and Clogheen; but we understand the auxthorities are about to do away with this separation, as this regiment will march to Dublin about the 16th inst, The iron screw steam storeship Himalaya, Commander Benjamin B. Priest, from Spithead, arrived at Plymouth on Sunday. The screw steam-frigate Lifiby, 51, went outside Plymouth Sound on Monday, in charge of Mr. 3fadge, Master of Ordinary, and a party of riggers, for a cruise round the Eddy. stone, to try her engines, which are of 600-horse power, by Messrs. Penn and Son. Although not in perfect -rim, the Ecrew being at least IS inches out, she attainec a mean speed of 12 1-10 knots, with 58 revolutions, and no hot bearings. Her Majesty's ship Queen, 116, Captain Robert F. Stopford, was towed from Plymouth Sound on Tuesday into Hamoaze, where her crew unbent sails, struck topsail yards, and commenced taking out her guns. She is to be paid off. The crew of the screw steamship Exmouth, W0, Captain Harry Eyres, are appointed to be paid wages at Plymouth to-morrow, and to have 14 days leave of absence. The screw steamship Sanspareil, 70, Captain Astley C. Key, had her powdertaken out at Plymouthon Monday. The crew of the paddle wheel steam frigate Valorous, 16, Captain Claude H. M. Buckle, are appointed to be paid wvages at Plymouth on Monday. The steam yacht Osborne, from the Channel Islands, entered Plymouth Sound earlyyesterday morning, and, having coaled, sailed about 3 o'clock for Cork. Admiral Berkeley, Sir Charles Wood, and Sir George Grey were on board, and they were visited by Admiral Sir -Tames H. Plumridge, Admiral Superintendent of Devonport dockyard. The official inspection by their Lordships will commence on the 15th inst. A detachment of Dragoons (the 7th), consisting of two officers and 120 men, embarked yesterday at Liverpool for Dublin. Four batteries of artillery are to embark at the same port on the 8th, 12th, and 10th, and 19thinst. fo,. ireland. The whole of the militia have left the Cuiragh encampment, and the troops now doing duty there are brigaded as follows :-First Brigade, Lieutenant-Colonel Bridge commanding; Brigade Major Corigan, Major of Brigade.

ACCMDENT ON TE= NORTHI-WEST}BRN RALWAY.- An accident, happily unattended with any serious casualty, took place yesterday morning a few hundred yards north of the entrance to the Watford tunnel on this line of railway. The Worcester morning express, consisting of an engine and tender and two large composite carriages, due at Euston at 11.15 a.mn., had passed the Eing's Langley station aU safe, and was approaching the Watford tunnel, when, from some unexplained cause, the engine jumped, and, with the tender, left the rails, and took its course along what is technically called the " six feet" between the up and down lines. The carriages were pulled off the rails by the concussion, and the whole train ran fuly 200 yards along the permanent way before the coupli;g broke. The engine and tender then ran on alone about 200 yards further, but, most providentiaUy the whole train came to a stand-still without any person hav-ing received serious injury. One genitleman got a contusion on the arm, bat no bone was broken, and no other accident was reposted. The driver and stoker kept their posts manfully throughout the few terrible moments between the engino having left the rails and coming to a stand, and to their intrepidity, in all probnbillty, may the freedom from serioas disaster be attributed. The worst effect of the accident was the stoppage occasioned by it at a critical moment of the day to the enormous traffic now passing over this railway; for although engine and carriages were clear of the rails and tho latter uninjured, both the up and down lies were necessarily blocked until the engine could be retransferred to the metals. The telegraph at the north end of the tunnel was soon set to work, and r,r. Stubbs, the active and obliging stationmaiter at Watford; having been communicated with, instantly took the necessary precautions to insure the safety of all expected trains. Locomotive aid was soon summoned from Camden, and after about three hours' delay engine and carriages were again in condition for travelling, and the disabled train arlived in London at half-past 3 o'clock. Some idea of the enormous traffic just now passing over this line may be gathered from the fact that the trains out of London detained by this accident extended in one continuous line from the tunnel-to a point south of Bushey station, at least a m3ie and a-half, and the up-trains formed a line of nearly as great an extent. The traffic last week realized 71,0001., a larger sum than on any previous occasion since the opening of the railway. STBrmE OF STONMUSONS AT NEWCASTL--ONTYm.-The whole of the operative stonemasons employed in the various public and private buildings in Newcastle-onTyne left their work on Saturday, and have not since returned. The dispute has originated in the determination of the men to enjoy a weekly half.holyday at the expense of their employers. Delegates had previously waited upon the masters, who had declined to give the men a half-holyday upon the terms proposed by them; and upon the delegates reporting to the men the failure of their nnssion thay strc'k work on Saturday at noon, and in the evening claimed a full day's wage, which, with two exceptions, the masters refused to pay. This absurd and unfatr attempt to coerce the mnasters to give the men half a dayi the week moets with but little sympathy from the working men.

ENGLISH FARMING. - - - -- TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIlEES. Sir,-'When a person connected vwit agriculture inspects the systems of farming practised in other districts than his own he ought to make known whatever he has seen that may prove interesting and useful to agriculturists generally. I recently examined a number of very well managed farms in England, aud am induced to send yau some remarks on what I saw. For the present my. observations shall relate mainly to farms situated in Essex. Within a few miles of Witham is Dorward's-hall, the -'opertyof ir. HEenry Diclson. Though farm. ing 11s own land, M1r. Dickson may in many respects be taken as a good model for the tenant farmer to follow. His farm consists in part of a strong loam, and in part of a lig,ht shingly soil, the first, if properly aerated, being particularly adapted for the growth of wheat and mangold; and the other only so when heavily manured. The crops upon the farm this year are remarkably fine, being, if any-. thing, overluxurianti. Mr. DI)ckson, lik e every other farmerwho has studied the science of agriculture,depends much on the deep cultivation of his land. At intervals of a few years he has all his ground deeply forked, and, though this entails an expense of about 41. per acre, he finds it a most remunerative system in the end. After this operation-following deep thorongh drainage, of course-he can raisefirst-class crops with very ordinary treatment; and this comp]etely accords with the theory of vegetable nutrition. If plants are to be nourished by the soil they ought to have a suflcient depth of it to ramify in, while their leaves must be fully exposed to atmnospheric action. The soil requmres to be prepared for giving up its elemnents by the same agency. It is by the joint action of air audnoisture that the insoluble mineral matters of the ground are rendered soluble and become capable of taking part in the building up of vegetable structures. Old Jethro Tull's principles require to be applied to some extent on every cultivated farm in the kingdom. He knew, as it-were, by intuition, that a well-stirred soil was enriched by the action of the atnosphere npon it, and, catching at this great truth, he proved by practical demonstration that nature's storehouse of ingredients capable of fertilizing the soil is to be found in the air which invisibly floats around us. The fact is undeniable that up to a certain point in the production of crops of all kinds the yield is in proportion to the depth the soil is wrought and thoroughly aerated. It is quite an easy matter, even on a thinly-wrought soil, to raise a bulky crop by the use of stimulating manures; but it is only when the land is stirred to a good depth, and the various enriching substances appled to it are properly proportioned, that the crop can be in a really normal state. "Finger and toe" in turnips, and every other disease which the farmer has to contend wvith, are only the necessary results of shallow culture,'gross manuring, and carelessness inthe raising of seed. Let deep cultivation become more general than it is, and diseases of all sortswillbecomemuch lessviralentthan they commonly are; but, it may be asked, will the working of ordinary land to the depth of 18 or 20 inches prove remunerative ? Mr. Dickson, Mr. Fisher Hobbs, Mr. Smith of Lois-Weedon, and many others, find it very profitable, and so shall every one who tries it on right princiDles. To return from this dig,ression to hIr. Dickson's farm. Wvhile the fly has destroyed many fields of swedes this year, both in England and Scotland, he perfectly succeeded in saving his crop by a very simple dressing. He tooksome road-dust, some soot, and a little guano, and, mixing these together, sowed thlem along the rows in the middle of the day. In a short time he found that the crowds of flies had altogether disappeared. Mir. Fisher Hobbs has long used a mixture of a similar sort, only he employs a little sulphur instead of guano, and thinks it better to apply it in the night season, when dew has fallen, than in the daytime. Either system is likely to be effective, and it is well that farmers should know how simple a cure they have at their command for this pest. Mfr. Dickson grows annually a considerable quantity of mangold wirtzel and Swedish turnip seed from selected bulbs. Judging from his very superior mangold crops, his seed must be deserving of the attention of those root growers who do not usualyraise their ownseed. After the seed has been reaped he w.orks the soil, and, applying a smaU quantity of manure, sows it w ith rape, which, being fed off with sheep, is a suitable preparation for wheat. As illustrative of the good which a landlord may do in advancing the interests of deserving workmen employed under him it is worth while referring, to the case of a gardener who has been patronized by Ir. Dickson. Some years ago this man was a common journeyman gardener. MIr. Dickson gave him a piece of land to cultivate as a market garden, erected a house for him, and got him credit to a small amount at a Bank in the district. The gardener was most industrious, and now he is not only in prosperous circumstances, but, besides being one of the earliest suppliers of the London market with forced fruits, is engaged in raising seeds for several seedsmen, among others the well-known Mllessrs. Peter Lawson and Son. Such a case as this is as creditable to the assisted as to the assister, and shows how much industry will do if it is only judiciously helped at the right time. Another farm in the neighbourhood of *VithamMr. W. Hutley's, of Powershall-is well worth a visit. As MIr. Caird has ably described the system of farming adopted there (Eniglish Agricuiture, p. 138-ongmans) it is unnecessary to say much of it here. MIr. Hutley farms very highly, and aU his cereal crops afford good evidence of liberal treatment. But, however highly he farms, there is one thing which strikes the visitor as very objectionable in his management,-that is the careless way in which he treatshis manure heaps. They are allowed to lie exposed to atmospheric action, without the slightest covering of soil, and, though much rotted, were being turned when I visited the farm to prepare them for the fallow break. This course cannot be taken without a severe loss beimg entailed, particularly in such scorching weather as we have recently had. While too much cannot be said in praise of MIr. Hutley's superior crops, it would be wrong to give him unqualified conmendation. He has evidently strong prejudices, and on manv points in agriculture holds antiquated views. MIr. Mechi's farm, for example, he abominates, and from what he stated it seemed that he w ould .shut his eyes if one took him to look at the Tiptree-hall crops rather than be ocularly convinced that they were really good. He seems to think also that thrashing mills are of very littie advantage to the farmer, and consequently, though his farm extends to nearly 2,000 acres, the crop is all thrashed by hand flails. Notwithstandino, these and other little peculiarities and defects in hWs management, Mr. Hutley is reaUly a good farmer, and is doing much more to develop the resources of the soil than many even who have brought science to bear on the every-day business of the farm. A few miles from Colchester, in Essex, is situated the farm of Mr. W. Fisher Hobbs, of Boxtedlodge-a name well known both in this country and abroad in connexion wvith the breeding of firstclass stock. Mr. Caird gives a short description of this farm in the work already referred to; but, inasmuch as M1r. Hobbs had only been owner of the property a very few years when MIr. Caird saw it, and was then little more than beginning the improvemients which are now producing great results, it may be wvell to notice some important features in his system of management. The various3 parts of the iarm, as a whole, are a good deal scattered, and the working expenses are therefore considerably more than mirht otherwrise have been the case. -Some portions of it consist of a strong rich marl, but the larger part is naturally a poor, thin, gritty, eatingsoiL Though varying inthis way a good deal in quality, the farm is uniformly in a high state of cultivation. Besides being a liberal manurer, MIr. Hfobbs has a great abhorrenece of weeds-living robbers of the soil's feracity-and there aro very few to be seen on his farm. For some years past he has grown wheat on the same land every alternate season, and yet the whole of his cereals are most magnificent crops. By the feeding off of turnips and rape with sheep he keeps his land at all times in high condition. There is one peculiarity in his management which may be adopted with advantage on meditum and light soils in the south of England. On the crop of vinter tares being removed from the ground he applies a light dressing of faruiyard manure, and sows early dwarf or "ei,ght-weeks rape." About the middle of July the rape is usually folded with sheep, and the ground is thereafter wrought and put under yellow turnips. In this way M19r. Hobbs is able to growtree cropsannually, ;sn .at the same time, by aply!3~g suitl.nanure;he .keeps the aeTin any state f fertilty he may -choose.- - At no period during theo 'vegetative season has he any vacant land. As soon as one crop is reaped-whether it be turnip seed, early-cabbages, orpeas-another iust come after it. In these eases rape or coleseed is utsually grown, and eaten off on. the laud. Either in one part of the farm or another he succeeds under this system in supplying a large number of sheep with green food, and these he regards as his best makers and most equable distributors of manures. Firt-class farming does not consist merely in keeping the soil in very hight condition, regardless of the expense which may De icurred; bat it consists-rather in drawing the greatest possible amount of produce from the ground with the least necessary out]ay, while everything like deterioration of it is still scrapulously avoided. In the latter aspect Mr. Fisher Hobbs is unquestionably a first-class farmer. There iz no loss in the cropping of his ground, and he knows so' fully the value of farmyard manure that he is careful to keep it constantly covered with soil if he has occasion to store it inthe fields. On one of his farms he has a very good covered homestal], which, besides afording excellent accommodation for stock, is very valuaole in preserving the manure from rains and atmospheric agency. Every year he collects and prepares a large quantsity of fertilizino matter by chlarring, not burning, hedge clippings, wood, clay, and sisnilar substances, and for greeni crops finds this compound of great value. lake Mfr. Dickson, Mr. Hlobbs is an advocate for deep cultivation of the soil. By the use of Cotgreave's plo-ugh, drawn by four horses, he can easily till the land 14 or 15 inches deep, and for such crops as cabbage and mangold wurtzel he finds deep culture indispensably necessary, if a heavy crop is to be obtained. 0O cabbages he can grow a great weight per acre, considerably upwards of 40 tons being quite an ordinary yield. He manures liberally for this crop with farmyard dung, and sets the plants in equilateral triangles, three feet from each other in al directions. The cabbage delights in anmoniacal fertilizers, and these 'with a due proportion of yard manuro are sure, on a deeply cultivated soil of ordinary quality, to furnish an enormous quantity of food for feeding and dairy stock. iBotht Mvir. Hobbs and Mr. Dickson plant the early York and the London market cabbages for use in the end of June and begiing of July, and, for affording a supply of house food further on in the season the Diunhead is preferable to any other variety. The improvements made on Mr. Fisher Hobbs's property since Ir. Caird, as Tlte Tiimes' Commissioner, inspected it some years ago, are very great, and have only aithin the last year or two begun to showv what they are calculated to yield. By keeping a tip shovel drawn by two horses frequently at work eminences have been lowered and hollows filled up. Large quantities of clay have been carted over the poor thin parts of the farm, and, by thlis and a high system of farmin,the crops on the latter are not so much inferior to those on the good land as one might have expected from its original poverty. Altogether, Mr. HIobbs's farm is now assuming that richness and finishwhich greatimprovements and sldlful farmiLg alone can produce. 'hiswill be seen and judged of by the public on the occasion of the Royal Agricultural Society's trial of reaping machines, which is to take place in a week or two at iBonted.-lodg,e. In the newly-erected, compact, and well-designed little homestead contiguous to the Mansion-house, but so situated as to be completely invisible fromi it witvllhe observed that every coomfort and converience have been provided without anything like extravagance being fallen into; and, if there is nothin.g very grand in the suites of buildings wh}ich more properly belong to the farm, there is at least a fair amount of good accomnmodation. This is especially the case with the c-overed homestal1 connected wi th the furthest outlying farm. It is simple and inexpensive, and is as useful a homestead as could be desired for a farm of the kind. Within the last seven or eight years Mfr. Hobbs has torn out nearly all the old fences on his property, and in one case has thrown as many as 13 fields intto one, mtaking in this case, however, rather too large an enclosure. He has planted new thorn hedges, and,though he has not yet succeeded in getting his workmen to dress them in the wedge shape, he is aiming at t-his, and will no doubt in afew years have very superior fences. Mfr. Hobbs is in favour of deep under-drains, and in some expeiments he has made has found that a system of ventilation promotes the efficiency of the drainage works. He has a series of ventilating shafts branching off from the drains at each end of the field, and these are provided with rising pieces which are boxed in with boards perforated to admit the necessary amount of air. HSis experience in this matter is perfectly in accordance with the teachings of science. It Is not needful, certainly, to ventilate drains in order to make the water run, but it is necessary to promote a circulation of atmospheric air between the drain and the siurface of the soil, by producing as far as may be possible a current of air through the channels intended to convey away the water. Over a ventilated drain unstirred clay will crack far more readily than it will do over one for which no ventilating appliance has been provided. I have hitherto said nothing about the famed pigs -which are known over all the world as MIr. Fisher Hobbs's breed. In consequence of their having had an attack of distemper he was, unfortunately, not an exhibitor at Ohelnsford; but his stock is now, perhaps, better than it ever was at any previous period. Every animal has such fine symmetry, and is so adapted for the layingon of fat, that one cannot conceive any improvement that may be made in the breed. 'his has long been the opinion of those who have had experience of these pigs in their pure state, and have managed them properly. It has been alleged by some persons that the breed is delicate, but this is not the case when it is pure. W17hen injudicious crosses have been made this is often the result, but not otlherwise if the animals are only cared for as well-bred stoclk ought to be. The breeds of Leicester and Southdown sheep at Boxted-lodge Farm, are also very superior, being about the best bred flocks that can be seen in any part of the country. MIr. Fisher Hobbs's farm is in too many detached portions ever to become an example holding that may be examined in the course of an hour or tw o; 1 yet it is a farm which, if gone carefully over, will supply to the visitor acquainted -with agoicultural matters a large amount of useful information. He will there find everything judiciously managed and the most made out of the soil that it is possible to make. This is saying much, but not too much; those who doubt what I have stated should go on the occasion Eof the reaping machine trial and judge for themselves. I am, Sir, your most obedient servant. J.

THE CITY GAS WOBKS AND THB CITY COMMS- SION OF SEWEBS. TO THE DIM0E O;1 TE TIMS. Sir,-Of all the abominations of the city which afflict the Temple, there is none equal to the pestiferous stink from the City Gas Worls, and, with the south-easterly wind which has lately prevailed, the nuisance has been poisonous. Let ne appeal through your columns to the City Conmissioners of Sewers to put an end to this nuisance. When Mr. Simon was their Officer of Health they did a little talking on the subject, and it is said that he got a promise from the city gas people that they would do something good. Dr. Letheby probably kIows nothing of our sufferings. I can assure him that we in the Temple are at least as pitiable objects as any inmates of common lodginghouses. He would win as well as deserve our warmest gratitude if he were to set that judgment agoing and save us from being poisoned. The report is that the City Commissioners of Sewers are so accustomed to bad smells that they think nothing of what knocks down an ordinary man.
