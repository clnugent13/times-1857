TNDISPUTABILITYthe onlycomnpletc_ SECUnRIY JmL inT ASSURAIXCI-What is mieant by an Indshpntable Policy? Inthefiru. lac-eitisunike other policies, the adjectivebeinused to imply sometbing to mark and,disingah such a polirp'from a1 other policies In the second place it means muchl more, r t implies that the policy to which the epithet Indisputable in given cannot be disPuted, except upon grounds beynd the reach and powver of the contracting9pasties toecontrol. In other words thepolicy is represented as being an indisputable as man can make it. The Indisputable Life Policy Companmy undertookc thin task, andI in Order most effectually to make the palmier they issuedindisprrtable and certain documents of security, they insertedI the following clause in their Deed of Settlement, thereby creating an effective and Iealbli. gaton.nspmtie uon heComassto ulll, ndwhich it latheroight ance; and that, on the contrary, the an0uDt soassrcd saU be paid at the time sitipulated by the policy, an if no such error, mistake, or omission had been made or di=covered." W%e have said that the above clause forms a part of the Dced of Settlement of the Companyaandthatideed beingTegistredinterms of the Act 7tud8 Vlet., e. ld there is nothing wanting to give it the fullest effect. It appears to have been carefully and anxiously prepared for the pnrposM of cutting off eCery grOund and pretext of dispute as to the vabdityof the policy; and we confess that we cannot find any words or eroes of sentences more operative, effective, or compu3sory for that purpose. In order the more effecta3y to show this, we would invite our readers to compare the above clause with the lawr as laid down by Scricant MarshaI in the passages already quoted from that learned authority. The indisputable clause says, "Every poicy issued by the Company shallbe indefeasible and indisputable, and the factof issuing thesameshaba be conclusive evidence of the vaBdity of thepolcy." Mr. SerjcantMarsiall, speakdng of the clause ordinarily insertedul l.o0icIes. says, t Itsepte immaterial forwhat putrpose or with what view it (awarranty) is nmade; but, being once inscrtsd in the policy, it becomes a binding condition on the assured, and unless ho can show thatit hasbeen complied with, he can derivenobenefitfrom the policy." IB other words, an Indisputable policy, when once boned, declaes that, de facto, all precedent questions are held to have beentiallsett ed, vvhereasan ordYnarpolicY declares on the faoe of it that the Drectrretain the power to eep al these questions open to dispUte untfl they have actuallypaid the amount of the policy to tho executor The Indisputable policy settles All preoceent questions-an ordinary poicY leaves them allunsettled. An Indusputable policy delarts, by the mere fat of its issue that all queosns relating to the hesath, ,haabt, age, kcm, of the asunred are, as far as the Company i con. ceened, aet atrest for ever. - An ordina picy leavesaUthese= 9 open to diprute, until the claim has ctuai been discha poed.- m 1WNDON INDISPUTBL LE POLI,CY COmPANY, 7S ormbard-gtreet; 24, Counaught-te-race; 3A, Denbigh-street, Belgraveroad, London.

Qoount on: the 11th of MarId the concluding l',AMtn were at 914 to 4. The belief that the ext,ent cof purchases to be carried over at the apT,roa&ting settlement to the next account will be extre-mely heavy, and that the pressure for money in the Stock-Exchange may consequently be eVpected to continue, was the main cause of the detression in the morning. At the same time, ad'vantage was taken of the opportunity to endeavour to excite uneasiness on the alleged fact of the President of the United States having resolved that nothing shall prevent him from effecting a rupture of diplomatic relations with this country. So far, however, from the latter course being calculated to excite an unfavourable feeling in financial circles in London, it shouild be viewed as hkely to have little other result than that of opportunely checking, a renewal of the improvident outflow of British capital to America, which would otherwise probably be among the first consequences of a return to peace.

In the disount-market to-day the demand was active, and the applications at the Bank of England were numerous. Further fluctuations occurred in foreign securities, but the markets finally closed with greater firmness. During the settlement which took place to-day two failures were announced, but they were not of an important character. Turkish Six per Cents. were negotiated at 92R, 91, 024, and I for money, and 93A., i, 924, ^, 92, 934, and 92a for the account. In the Four per Cent. Guaranteed Stock the transactions were at 1024, -s, and 4, and the last quotation was 102$ to 103. The other business comprisedBraziliani Five per Cents., 1014 to 102; Rothschild's Four-and-a-Half per Cents., New, 924; Ecuador Provisional Land Warrant, 34; iGranada, NewActive, 20.; Mexican, for money, 204; for the account, 20j to .Q; Russian Five per Gents., 106; the Four-and-a- 'fperCents., 924; Sardinan Five per Cents., for money, 884 and 894; for the account, 89; Spanish Three per Cents., 42 and 414i; the New Deferred, 23; Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 044; and Peruvan Dollar-bonds, 634 and 6he closing quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this eveninmg were 70f. 70c. for money and 70f. 90c. for the account, showing an additional improvement of 1 per cent., although the pressure for money is extreme and the rate of continuation on Rentes is between 15 and 18 per cent. At Amsterdaam the stock-market has slightly receded. At Vienna there has been a fresh rise of more than 2 per cent. in the funds (making a total advance of 12 per cent. within the past fortnight), while the exchange on London has also experienced another favourable movement of 1 per cent., the quotation being 10'28. Businmess in the corn-market continues in a great degree suspended, owing to the inmreasing expectations of peace, and the rates this morning were nominally the samue as on MIonday. The amount of specie brought by the West India steamer to-day is 140,000l., of which 90,0001. is gold. The advices from Panama to-day again demonstrate the suiperiority of that route for communicationwith Australia, dates having been received from Melbourne to the 2d of November, or five days later than those by the Champion of the Seas. The new discoveries of gold quartz within 20 miles of Geelong are alleged to have yielded 880 ounces of gold to the ton. The Shalimax was to leave for Liverpool with the mail on the 9th of November. At Sydney many failures continued to take place, and others were expected, but it was hoped the worst had passed. Large arrivals of flour had taken place from Valparaiso, and the price was now 471. per ton. The quotations of gold were 75s. 3d. per ounce at Melbourne and 78s. at Sydney. The commercial advices by the overland mail today are not unfavourable, although the markets,both at Bombay and Calcutta, have been interfered with by an increase in the pressure for money. At Bombay the business in manufactured goods hacl been rather large, while at Calcutta, notwithstanding a suspension of activity, prices had been fairly maintained. From China the principal intelligence relates to the stoppage of Aspinall, Mackenzie, and Co., of Shanglhai, for 150,0001. They had been among the chief operators in the tea-market for the past three years, and it is expected their assets will prove small. Little of the loss will fall in London. This has been the first serious failure at Shanghai since the trade of that port grew into importance, and the absence'hitherto of any experience calculated to beget caution is believed to have induced among the Chinese dealers a too easy system of credit. The half-yearly meeting of the United Mexican Association took place to-day, Sir J. Easthope presiding, wvhen the report was received and approved. The works at Jesus Maria and La Trinidad mines are making progress ; but a farther outlay will be requ-ired to test their produce at a greater depth, and 8,0001. is estimated as the necessary amount. The assets in MIexico include 6,0001. cash and ores, and 10,0001. a claim on the Government; but, as regards the latter, the present condition of politics excludes the expectation of its immediate payment. It is thought, however, that sufficient can be provided from thlese sources to carry out operations, and the directorspronmise to exercise strict economy. The funds in London represent 10,8001., of which 5,0001. stands to the credit of unclaimed dividends, while 5,3001. will have to be appropriated to meet outstanding liabilities. If further capital should prove to be essential, the directors propose to avail themselves of the power to raise the remainder of the loan granted on a previous occasion. At a meeting of the Electric Telegraph Company held this afternoon, General Wylde in the chair, the dividend declared was at the rate of 6 per cent., free from income-tax, and the report and accounts were adopted. It was stated that business is progressing satisfactorily, and that the number of messages during the last six months was 384,000, against 372,000 in the previous period. With respect to the balance-sheet some explanations were afforded in connexion with general expenditure which elicited the approval of the great majority. Subjoined are the revenue and the profit and loss accounts. BEVEx%UE ACCUNr FOR 3a= =F-YUItR XN-Dxx DEC. 31.

It was stated that, although a sum exceeding 8,000!. had been lent to emigrants who had come to Victoria, all that had been received hack was 1,500l., and that the recovery even of this had cost nearly 50 per -cent. of the amount. I The meeting was numerously attendedt and a re- solution condemning such of their countrmen as i ewuld thus continue to disgrace themselves was ? I unanimously adopted. It was believed, however, that the result of legal proceedingp against some of thedefaylters would ,bemore elfectual than anything. else in leiding to further collections. At otherm eeting_of the- new amsociation of raiL-, way proprietors was held to-day at the London Tavern, to arrange for the organization of a council of 100 members, of whom 28, consisting of leading sliareh-olders, wore at once noniinated. * The following further communication has been received regardihng the Westinster Improvement Comnussuoll:_ -"Sir,-Myattention has been directed to a statement contained in The Timcs of the 24th inst., in reference to the afais -of the Westminster Improvement Commission. " It will be apparent to all business men that the objectof the eommission was analogous to that of a railway company, which can only prove remunerative when its work bas made considerable progress. At first all must be outlay-viz., in the purchase of land and property, rent, rates, and taxes in respect of property so purchased; Parliamentary and surveyors' fees, payments to Commissioners o#; Sewers; law, arbitration, audconveyancingexpenses; salari5,, wages, assurances, commissioners' fees, interest on bo-nds, loans, . So far the comalrison with a railway 'holds 'ood; but then comes a materal difference, for whexeas or- iaarzy shares pay no interest till a profitable tvAffichas arisen, the bonds and loans of the commission bore interest within a very short period of its outset, although up to this time no profit has arisen. j The first tangible date given in thestatements von refer to is 1852. Of the bonds issued prior to the 1st of April in that year, 200,6000. were then a charge on the COmnnssion, aIllothersof anterior date having been paid off. On the 31s of December, 1854, the total of bonds chargeable had increased to696,9701., being an augmentation of 486,370l. A further issue to the amount of 290,801. had, indeed, been made, but most of these bonds were lodged as collateral security only with mortgagees, who took them as well as property, so that when the property is realized the bonds are returnable to the commission. This last item (290,0S01.) must clearly be deducted from the 977,0501. quoted in your statement as the amount of bonds on the 31st of December, 1854, inasmuch as the commissioners had received no consideration for it, and no part of it had been publicly netotiated. Thus, against vour item of 1,030,5701., the ne increase between 1852 and 1854 was 486,3701., and the amonnt in actual circulation, instead of being 977,0501., was 686,W81. "The balanec-sliest laid before the bondholders at the meeting of the 26th of January, 1855 (quoted in 2T e inzes of the following day showed that if means could have been raised to get the ground covered the assets would have more than sufficed to meet all demands. The real cause of the deplorable stoppage v.as the impossibility of raising capital snffldent to proceed with the undertakirn to the point at w hich profit could be realised. "Thne statements you quote also refer to the extraordmnary issue of bends to Mr. Mackenzie, the builder, withont proper security. It is not for me to defend the act of the commissioners in this respect, further than to express my own conviction that it arose from an anxiety-I might say over anciety-to get the property built upon, and from a misplaced confidence in the value of the securities. 1now come to the question of expenses. Your items are 100,0821. from 1845 to 1852, and 14%58130. thence to Decamber, 1854-in all 248,8951.

Bridges, Mfason, and Bridges, for t e whole 10 years during which the firm had to transact the legal business connected with obtaining five acts of Parliament, to manage numerous conveyancing transactions, and generally to attend to the whole legal affairs of the commission. Their costs were 2S,16SI. Sr. 10d., of which, it will be self-evident to the profession, full one moiety con:sisted of fees, &-c., out of poCket. Moreover, a great deal of the business was transacted by agency, absorbing a stil fuartherproportion of the apparent remuneration. "I have rigidly confined myself to facts and figures brought out by my own investigation, the results of which were fully laid before the committee of bondholders immediately on their appointment in 1855. My balance-sheet, with a very detailed cash account, also drawn up by me, was placed by them in the hands of Quilter, Ball, and Co., the emineno accountants, who repeatedly attended at my offices to examine thebooks. Thus, instead of being altogether confused, and without verification of any kind,' as alleged by the complainants, the accounts were fuUy set forth, and everT facility was afforded for the most rigid investigation. "H. CROYSDILL, Accountart. 84, Basinghall-street." The annexed is from the Committee of LMexican Bondholders:- "The coleanittee have received advices from Mr. Whiteheid, dated Mfexico, the 2d1 inst. The president ad il1tCi'in, General Alvarez, had resigned in favour of General Comonfort. Don Manuel Payno had succeeded Don Guillermo Prieto in the MIinistry of Finance, and Mr. Whitehead had had asatisfactorYinterviewwiththe former gentleman. There were $45,000 in Vera Cruz, and also a certain amount in Tampico (perhaps some $15o,000), ready for shipment by the present packet, but the weather prevented her from embarking those funds. The committee have also a letter from their agents in Mazatlan, dated the 13th nlt., advising al additional shipment of $12,231 by Hrer MIajesty's steamer The subjoined sLatements are from South American mining companies:- MAtBIQUIT2.

The co,s at Purima includes the expense of putting up new stamping mills. Gold to the amonnt of $15,130 has been received by this packet," MExIcaN AIND SoUTH Amumcay. "The directors have received advices from their establshments in Chili by the Atrato. The advices from Henadora Smelting -Works are to the 15th of December. Mr. Barnes, the chief superintendent, had arrived on the 4th, and carried out the board's orders by dismissing Mr. L. E. Alison and Mr. Frederick Field. The Law Ogilby arrived on the 4th with bricks, furnace irons, clay, &c., and was to be laden with copper and regulus. The Isabella, with 350 tons of coal and a supply of acids, arrived on the 12th, and would load Nwith regulus. A large stock of ore and regulus was on hanld. The advices from Caldera Smelting Works are to the 17th of December, on which day Mr. Podbard, the superintendent, had arrived. Several vessels were discharging~ coaL. At large stock of regulus and silver regulus was waiting for shipment. Since the last advices the Nina and Fanny have arrived at Swansea with copper, copper regulus, and silver copper regulus, on account of the com- NEsV GItASADA. The directors have received, by the Atrato, golddust, the produce of their mines of Frontino and Bolivia, for the month of November last, valued at 9501." Ar. E. W. A. Tusoli, Chancellor of the Austrian Consulate-General in London, has just furnished a valuable contribution to commercial literature, under the title of the Britis& Constd's Manual. * A work of this description was greatly wanted, and much care and labour appear to have been exercised to make it as complete as possible. IIn addition to its general features it contains a most useful consolidation of the commercial treaties and conventions concluded between Great Britain and foreign countries, while there is likewise included in the appendix a vocabuLary of international and maritime la and insurance, and full tables of foreign I moneys, weights, and measures, with their eqtuva- Ilents in English. Its style is clear and concise, and, altogether, the book is likely to become a standard one, not only among Consuls, but also with merchants and shipowners. * Loagman.
RAILWAY INTRLrGENCE, RAT.lWAY REFORM The adjourned meeting of the Rag1>4y ghare-ilder,t Protection Association was held -erday at the London TavernMr. M alins in the cb.;ar The meeting ws very well attended. The following roport tt tt, cornnittee vas submitted:a "Since the last m.uets your committee have been; in commnunication -4th rW*y influential proprietors, and have obtained-much valukle information, many important offers of co-eperati,n, axtevery indication of liberal pecuniary Y' our. Qonnuittee purpose, with a view to a rapid and eficient ergaimtion of the association,.to obtain, with all eonverAent speed, lists of the shareholders in the various liner, when a direct application will be made to every indivien.ul to enrol himsef amember of your association, and tAey ate encouraged to believe that the result will be such a,eoncentration of the proprietary influence as must speedily mnake itself felt in the conduct of railway affiirs. "You comunittee have not thought it expedient to 'define with too rigid precision the objects or modes of action of the association, deeming it. nore desirable that these vital subjects should receive the deliberate consideration of the council when fully formed. " Your committee have had under their consideration the various suggestions brought before the mecting held on the 22d inst.; among others, the proposal that railway proprietors should be invited to enrol themselves es masse m the ranls of the association, and that the council might rely for funds on spontaneous contributions to be made from time to time; but your committee, being of opinion that the scale of the operations of the association can only 'be safely based on a reliable fund, have not deemed it advisable to adopt this suggestion; but desirous of excluding none by a high subscription, they reconmnend that an annual payment of half a guinea shall constitute membership. Pt will be obvious that even this arrangement will {at all events, for the present) necessitate the exercise of a jndicious liberality on the part of the more wealthy supporters of our objects. "Your committee have also considered the question of local associations, and are of opinion that their establishment will be eminently usefuL In accordance with this view the chairman attended an influential meeting at Liverpool on Monday last, and a powerful association is in process of organization in that town. Time did not ashint of his visiting Manchester, but the committee hope that a similar association will be forthwith formed there, which will be well supported; and they are glad to announce that they have good grounds for believing that powerful local associations wil be folmed without delay in most of the principal towvns of the united kingdom. " Your committee are fully sensible that they will have much to overcome in the inertness of many proprietors, and in that official hostility which ever mamiferts itself towards vigilant control; but, having no party battles to fight, no personal antipathies to serve, actuated solely by the single purpose of restoring prosperity to a depreciated property, they are encourag,ed to believe that at no dlistant day the association w;ill be potent for good, and conduce to making railway management as conspicuous for adherence to soumd comuercial principles as railway enterprise is for its pro-eminent m3agnitude.' The CaLs-naAN said-Gentlemen,-In my first address I endeavoured to state those leading facts which bear so preeminently and so forcibly upon the welfare of your property; and if I should repeat some of them to-day for the purpose of pressing them more strongly on the public mind, you will excuso me. It is only seven days since I first met you in this room; and therefore remember this association is only seven days old. (Hear, bear.) The question of railvay reform is one which I have entertained most carefully and most seriously for the last three years. I have been looking at it, so far as my limited ability enabled me, in every possible way, to see how the present course of ruin was to be averted and improvements effected. For that purpose I took the prominent measure of asling the london and North-Western Railway in August, 1854, to appoint a committee of investigation, stating that if they acceded to it I hould make the saise motion at the Great Western and the Great Northern, feeling satisfied that if in a spirit of peace and conciliation a committee should be appointed from each of those great concerns to consult for their matual benefit, the olive branch might prevail over those discords ald 'doubts whlich had existed so long, and that the greatest possible benefit might have resulted. (Applause.) But upon that occasion r was met by the late cllairman, Mr. Glyn, with many kind and conciliatory remarks, conclduing, however, with the observation thatthetimehadnotyet arrived for action, and requesting me to postpone my motion for a committee. In accordance with his wishes I did so, and, six montits more having elapsed, the directors of the North-Western Railway themselves appointed a committee at the meeting in-August last. Wehave not yethadany report fromthat committee, but I had the pleasure of seeing one of its members at Liverpool a day or two since, and he said, " The great thing we want is peace." I fully conenr in that observation; for I believe that, great as is the exhaustion of Russia from the contest which has been going on, it is not greater than the exhaustion of railway interests from the wars which they have been carrying on. (Cheers.) To remedy this state of things we ask concurrence, advice, information, and sugestions from every one of you, trusting that ve may b1e able to bring about that desirable end, and that we may make that magnificent property which we represent remunerative and advantageous to those who hold it. Since I saw you last I have had communications from every principal city, and from isolated shareholders aU over the country, all breatlhing the same spirit of ardent desire to see a restoration of peace and prosperity to our concerns. But among those letters is one which contains a most remarkable sentence; itisfromlEdinburgh; and,afterexpressing the fulest concurrence in our views, the writer says "I cannot recommend you to hold a public meeting in Edinburgh, for few people would attend it, because the very fast of attending a meeting, and being known as a railway shareholder, vwould cause a man to be Consideredwhat o you think ?-a gambler." (Cheersand laughter.) So, here is a property amounting to :300,000,001.-the largest aggregate of property which was ever contributed for any great coninercial object-and yet so low is the repute in which it is held that no man in the far-si_ted metropolis of the north can be known as a shareho der in railways without his character beig injured and his bemin pt down as a gambler. Now, I ask yon, is that right H ore is a property which has conferred the greatest possible benefit utpon society in every wvay-railways may, in fact, be called e very " legs" of society (hear), for every improvement, every convenience, every enjoyment that we have is more or loss connected with railvays and with the facilities which they give to intercourse; and yet such is the lamentable faet, althou"h our property comprises, I believe, six times as mue¶ capital as that which isembarkedinthegreateotton trade, 20 times the capital of the Bank of England,l preponderatingoverevery otherinterestwhichcanbementioned. Gentlemen, I have great faith in the stil small voice of truth, and I believe, though the first meeting was not a very large one, that we have only to place the truth before you an it will prevail and bring about the object which we have in view. (Cheers.) TWere were tvo or three leading reasons which induced us to fix upon this particular perioa for commencing the present movement-one of which was the great contest winch has been going on in the Eastern Counties Company; because I felt assured that that contest miust in a most remarkable manner call the attention of the whole country to the actual position of railway property. We therefore fixed the first meeting before the great contest vas to take place, and the meeting to-day Just after it that we might avail ourselves of the practical knowlede and informat-ion resulting from that contest. I have no hesitation in expressing my firmest belief that, let whoever may be chainlian and directors of the Eastern Counties Railiray for the future, that property must be better managed, anld will be better managed than it has been, in spite of anything that the board or the directors can do; because, though it has been endeavoured to throw great discredit upon the efforts of the investigation committee, they have brought to light, upon evidence which no man can dispute, facts which go to the root of railway prosperity or adversity. One faet is worth a bushel of arguments; and I shall take from Mr. Waddington's owvn book the facts of the coal trade, and shall endeavour to lay them before you in the way in which they strike my mind upon the subject. In page 101 of his book which is called "the appendix," hogives you the cost and the profit of the coal tratfic. He states that the coal traffic fronm Peterborough consists of a ti-ain of 30 waggons, containing 61 tons of coal each, making a total quantity of 190 tons of 6eal in each train. He then gives you the cost of working that train at somethig under Is. 63Jd. o-er train niile, and he takesthe earnings at gs.3dpertramnnie. The difference, therefore, between ls. 6iL, and 8s. 3d. ought to be the net profit. If these figures he correct, then the difference between tle cost ot working and the receipts should be the net profit. Now, applying that to the Eastern Counties line, you will find that the total cost wouldhbe only 156,0001L for the half- ear, while the earnings would e 477,OOL., and that they should therefore have made a profitof 321,0001, upon the working of the half-year. I ask you if that corresponds with the fact? IHear, hear.) On the contrary, you wiU find that the tot-al amounlt set forward as applicable to dividend is only 55,000. ; and from the evidence of Mr. Brug the engineer to the Eastern Counties Company, you will find that at least 150?. a-mile should be set apart vi'early for the maintenance of the permanent way. You wil find from other of ficers of the company that the buildings upon the line have gone to dilapidation and decay, an that a large sum iS necessary to repair them. Malke a calculation of these items, and you will find that the total earnings are absorbed by these e.xpenses, leaving no sum whatever to be divied as profit among tho ordinary shareholdems (Hear, heart ?fear that that is not a solitary case by any means; tor I believe that the same failacy of calculating expensesand p rofits pervades very many other lines,' including the first lins in the kingdomi. (Hear, heat.) I have remnarked upon the Londcn and North-Western Company beeause, being the leading line, it must command llothers,andif thatlinewillnot comeinto afairandreasonable system of prices no other wit Before I undertook the formidable task of suggesting to so respectable and numerous and powerful a body as tTo North-Western directors that they were working upon an erroneons system I took aS niuch pains as possible to ascertain the accuracyof my opinions; and, having done so, I have no 'hesitation in saying that I believethe same fallacywhichIhaveendeavoured to show you in regard to tie Easter Countiescalculations pervades the whole railway mind (hear, hear) ; that the expenses and the profits were both calculated upon paper; but that when they come to the stern reality of the case, one is found to exceod the calculation just as much as the other falls short of it. It is for these reasons that I have suggested, as a mode of correcting this evil, that there should be an efficient audit before things are paid for (hear, hear), and before yoe permit your traffic managers, and receivers, and various other officers'-whso are numerous enough TO do very muech better for you than they have done attetainthee mater; an tht whn atrain passes from P eterbarorgh to amy other part of the lino the actual receidts of that train shouild be ascerained befor another is allowed to prooeed between the Eame places. You will find that there isjust as much trouble in shunting, backing, and managing the coal traffic as any other traffic you carry on, and that the cost is very large. (Hear, -hearl -Youj-by that coal-traffic, have conferred-the-greatea. possi le advantage and comfort on the whole kingdom, by supplying coals at a moderate price to places where it used to be 2'. and 3S- a-ton ; and'why are yon, iwho havedonsethit for the comnmunity, to be deprived of your fair shbar6 of profit for that great benefit conferred upon;the whole country? (Cheers.) I do not attribute this vicioui system pursued by directors to any desire to-do you wrong. I know that there are among the ralvlsg directorate' of this country many of the most honourable anaresarctibIe men in tho kingdom, who desire as msikh as.,I doto do i iikt is rijt, and the only task before us is to support thees in the right path. If wre do that, we s ihall soon have a change in the management of these great concerns E(Hear.) The only profits, I believe, upon )2ilWsy8 are made bynpassenger traffic; andI unfortunatelye io n England swamp the profit which issmade by passengers in the expense of the goods traffic, lam confinned in these views by observing upo& the North-Western Railway what have ben the engs of the engines. In 184-inyearsago,-!haveadver more than once to that happy perod when the NorthWestem w n cet,-in I84 the netearning of each engine was 5,26 'whereas in 1854 the gross earning of each engine was only 425L, although in the in terval engines have been greatly imxproved in construction, and, beingnowr made of gigantic power, they ought tohave earneda greatdeal more, insed of less, thanin 1848f. When you compare these earnings-net in the eone case and gross mn the other-you must see that some grievous error exists in the mode of conducting the traffic, Reverting again for a moment io the Eastern Counties matters-and I feel that it is quite fair to advert to them, because they have been so much before the public that they really are public property, and afford us information of wichi we shbulA take the utmost possible advantage, without any apology being necessarythefact that officials upon the Eastern Counties are employed by a coal company, for example; that another is engaged as a coal merchant, and that a third is a shipovner, demonstrates such a state of things to my mind that I have no hesitation in saying that it must absolutely be altered, and that your servants, being sufficiently paid, must give their whole time andattentiontoyourinterests. (Hear.) If gentlemen have such clever heads on their shoulders that they cannot confine themselves to one object, then I should beg,of themto seek some other employment, where their talents may have wider space; but, at all events, let us take careto have competent men to carry onouraffairs. (Cheers) Although lMr. Goeech has been a friend of mine for years, and I knowhim to be a man of great andvaried talent, yet I say that the locomotive &afirs of. the Eastern Counties Railway, or of any railway of half its magnitude, are quite sufficient to occupy the whole attention ot any locomotive superintendent. It as a duty made up of very numerous small details, combined with larger matters, requiring the greatest possible care and attention; and, thongh I entertain the highest opinion of Mr. Gooch's abilities as a locomotive enineer, yet!I say that he has not ability enough to attend So the affairs of the Eastern Counties Company, and to be a coal merchant, a shipowner, and various other things besides (cheers), and any board of directors who knowingly permit such a state of things to exist are guilty of the gravest neglect of the interests committed to their care. It must be a matter of great regret that railways, instead of being left to the development which their magnificent simplicity of construction would seem to secure, should be liable to all sorts of influences of an extraneous description-that A, BA C, D, for example, should have theyower of saying, " If you do not pay us a certain comMissOn your goods cannot go." A case of this description came tomy knowledge the other day at LiverpooL A gentleman wished to send 1,500 bales of Uanchester goods for shipment to the port of London, but he could do it only by paymg Is. per bale for those goods to some person who pocketed that 75!. which I believe belonged to the railway company. It is one of our objects to remedy such glaring evils as these. We wish to set about it not out of hostility to any particular board, but in the most conciliatory spirit ; and we think that when we acquire sufficient strength and numbers we should address ourselves to every board in the kingdom, and should say, " Gentlemen, after careful consideration"-and we will give it that careful consideration before we begin to act-" we think that so and so would conduce to the benefit of your railway, and we ask you to adopt it." (Cheers.) We now ask you, gentlemen, and every shareholder in the kingdom, and the public at large, to give us support, and to favour us -with such suggestions, ba3ed uponexperience, theory, or what not, as may enable us to mature plans for the better management of the magnificent ralvway property of this country. (Hear.4y these means we propose to act upon every railway cbard where we see occasion. We do not wish to interfere unnecessarily; we do not desire to cause vexation or annoyance toany railway board where they are going on properly -and I am happy to say there are some railways where everything is carefully managed, though they are still capable of improvement with regard to the separation of their capital and revenue accounts. I hope to see the revenue of railways greatly augmented, hut not by increasing passenger fares;* for I believe the fares published in Rradshaw2 arc amply sufficient to remunerate railway propriet4rs for as many trains as are required. Neither do I bheve that we need reduce the number of trains to the disadvantage of the public. I do not think that it is necessary, because I believe that it is more advantageous for a railway to ran a number of light trains than to employ those monstrous engines which, by their great momentum-their vis incrtice-destroy the permanent way; and, inasmuch as there is generally an abundant staff of emsploya, it is better, perhaps, that they should be employed than that they should be standing idle. (Hear, hear.) I much prefer the system adopted. en the Brighton of dividing thetrains-starting two at the same hour, and sending one on with the through passengers, while those who want to stop at intermediate stations proceed by the other. I do not believe, therefore, that it witl be necessary to diminish the accommodation to the public; but I thinkl that in many cases it miay be increased without any loss to the railway. With regard to the Eastera Counties Company, I feel convinced that they will be set right by the force of public opinion which hasbeenbroughtto bearuponthem. In .Waddington's reply he appends a map of the district; and any gentleman who casts his eye over that map must be struck, as I often have been, with the compactness, and the soundness, and the dimensions of the distridct from which from 20,00D. to 25,000! a-week is raised. That linepossesses the great advantagethat the carriages or trucks of the EasternCountiesRailway need never go off their own territory. The distances to be run are comparatively small, and I can see no reason why a district such as is peculiar to the Eastern Counties should not be managed with exitraordinary economy. (Heax.) Instead of requiring men of a vast amount of talent, such traffic calls for the exercise of far less talent than is exhibited every day in this metropolis in managing concerns the details of which are infinitely more difficult and intricate than those ofthe Eastern Counties Company. In a railway you havebut torepeat the same thing day after dayand year after year, despatehing your trains and delivering your traffic with regularity. Really all that you rsqni is p ledding attention and integrity (hear, hear), and those qualities without which no commercial undertakin,g can succeed. IUnfortunately, the early success of railways induced such extravasant confidence that people thought they had only to get a few miles of railway to isure a fortune. That, however, has not proved to be the case; and those who have had the management of railways have not looked upon these things withthatsound commercial eye which is so essential to success; othertise I never could have laid before you such statements as I have to-day with regard to the coal trafiic of the Eastern Counties Railway. (HIear.) The ques-. tion of the deterioration of railways is a most important one, which you must meet boldly. It is no use postponing from year to year the expanse of keeeping y our railways in order. As Mr. Stephenson says in his interesting address to the Institution of Civil Engineers, after the newness of the first constrection of a line has worn of, an annual charge for wear and tear becomes as much an essential as the coke you burn and the wages you pay. It is no use attempting by reserve funds to postpone the evil day; but you must set apart 150L. per mile per annum to keep the railway in order. If you do not do that, it leads to the error that your traffic managers compute the expenses at less than they are, and carry goods at a lower price than they cost you; ad thus a double injury is inflicted upon you. My advicc to you is-never let anything gob out of order. Instead of having a report from a Government officer that the road is not safe, keep it up in perfect repair. The cost of such a system will be comparativelylittle, wvhile the cost of casaalties and accidents as incalculable. (Cheers.) We propose to-day to elect a certain portion of the council. Our proposition is that the council should consist of 100 members lu London and throughout the country. We must have the foci in the principal towns in the kingdom, and we believe that we shall have mo difficulty whatever in getting togetherithe proper parties in the different towns. We therefore propose to-day orny to lect 25 out of the 100; and from the council it isproposedfthatweshould selecttheactingcommittee. That committee was apponted, in part, at the ftin meeting, and to-day we sha31have toadd to that number. We proposeetlat the executive committee should consist of not less than 12, and not more than 20 members, out of the 100. I have a list beforeome ofthe 25; and, with regard tothe flnances,!I have the satisfaction of statin?g that, so far as we have gone, there is every indication that the " sinews of was will not be wanting. (Hear, hear.) The members of the cominittee have most of them put down 10!. 10s., and they are readyto multiplythat sumby 10 if it should be necessary; but, inasmuch as the railway community consists of 150,00D shareholders and their famnilies, we apprehend that a very small subscription will give us jample funds. WFe believe that l0s. 6d. fromthe smnall shareholders, with as much more as the large ones like to give us, will provide sufficient funds to keep this agitation-if you please to cal it so-before the shareholders of tho Idngdom at large, and will place us in a position to act with great power and efficiency in any qaarter that we may think necessary. (Cheers.) In concluIon,! shall only add that from all parts of the country I have received letters offering assistance in any way that it may be required. I have had interviews with engineers, with railway officials, with shareholders, and with men of all descriptions, all of whom concur, without exception, in approval of the movement and in offerinp their most cordial co-operation. I was favoured with an mterview, also, this morning with a noble peer of great judgment and sagacity-tord Wynfordwho expressed himself in simnilarl gratifynmg terms; and, although Ais Lordship declined to be a member o the council, fearing that it would fetter the independent exercise of his judgAsent inothe rtous of oecer he has proRmsed to afford us all the aid and influence which be can 'commland.

M5r. kITCHL said if he had ever entertained a oubtas to the success of the movemen£, that doubt had been re*noved by the communications they had received from all parts of the country, offering asstance andwishin ther tVJ go on and prosper. Thev were certainly much indebtod to the pren for the great aistanee it had given them. It; was sid by nme that it was the right movement at the right time, but he could not say whether the right mea were in the right places. At all events they would do, their besL They had waited a long time for more iiflentialmentocomeforward; bit it appeared they nVhb have waited longer, peraps until too lat The miaceta value of their 124000,00. of ordinary railway capitTl had dwindled down to 89,00OD00, and would probably be soon lover, if they had not come forwari to save it from further depreciation. The f1lling o£ in the value of the Ehares of some of the great lines of railway was veryserious In 1S53 the Eastern Counties ordinary shares were 13L. each; now they were 8L ; the Great Western stock in 1853 was 961., now it was -; the London ana North-Westen in 18I3 was 126m., it was now 94. He might go through the whole list, and show similar depreciation. There existed an erroneous ss tem, which pervaded the management of all th railway companies, and it would be the duty of the association to act uniformly pon them all, with aview to alter the course which had been adopted. The fares and mode of conducting the traffic vould require revision, agreaterL nformity in the fares for paeersand for goods rehould be established, a complete revisal as to runnig trains, so as to obtain on theiwliole a fair remuneration for their outlay. Notwithstanding the great discouragement the oriinal shareholders had exprenced, there wan some prospect of amnendmnentIthadben shown by a statistical statemeut of railway traffic in Hcr-pwahs .ournal that in 1853 the railway traffici of certain railways in the united indom amounted to. 16,845,0001., andm lSoo it had increased to 20,243,ODLV., with an addition to the mileage of only 72 .miles. It wa& also shown from the progressive improvement of railway tmaffic tuat in the course of sixorsereni years hence the traffl ef those railways would probablybe 30,00M 000. per annum. These were strong reasons why theyshould exert themselves to obtain a fair return on their ontlay, but there were others, there was a great number of helpless shareholder_x who could take no part in the movement-widows an& orphzns, who may fairly look to the association to protect them from further injmu The resolution was unanimously carried. and it was agreed that the following gentlemen should form the council:-namely, Mr. W.

The haef-yearly meetincm of this company was held ot Thursday athendal, Mrr.

This sum ompletes the contract, and upon wghich rent ha been duly received; a further outlay may be necessary to' meet the requirements of the tenant to a very limited extent. The gmnss ineome of the company hais falne short of the correspond ig haf-year of 18 by 220t , which is chiefay owing to changes in the system made by a neighbouring company in forwarding the goods tralfie. On the other hand, the expenses of locomotive power and "eneral charges are dimnished by 3421, but much of this savinghas been absorbed by an icrease in the rates and trxes, and byan increased rate of mnterest. The profits on the working of the line during the post half-year are 821. less than at th correspAonding period of 1854. The directors recommend a. dividend of osi. per share out of the net profi4s which will absorb 1,0427., and leave 693L. to be carred to the reservet fund.

I BIRK 1D DOCKS. At a special meeting of the iverpool Town Council, heldc yesterday, a long discussion took place on the provisions of , the bill for carrying ito effectthe Birkenhead Docks Act of 1855, providing for the constraction, completion, ansi management of the Birkenhead Docks. Mr. T. 1 HODSON objected to the 12th clause, -which gives the coporntion power to constract new and altered works at BirkeDhead, according to the plans of Ur. Hartley, surveyor of the iEverpool Docks, on the gound that, the purchase of the docks having already cost 1200,000?., it. w.as most imprndent to expend 850,000. upon the proposed new work. .Mr. Hodson advocated such an extension as would cost 140,000., and accommodate al, the trade whicla might be anticipated for 10 or12 years at Birkenbead. After a long discussion, in which Mr. Hornbv, Mlr. Alderman Home, Mr. Picton, Mr. C. Turner, and Mr. Bramley MNoore, MP., took part, the whole of the clauses were passed, and the hill was referred to the Birkenhead special committee to take the proper steps for its prosecution. NORTH BRITISE. The adjourned meeting of this company for the purpose of considering Mr. Walker's motion to instruct the directors-. to withdraw the money bill now in Parliament rwas held. at Edinburgh on Tuesday. Mr. Hodgson, chairman, presided.X The CsUAMir- again stated the intention of the direc; tors to offer their seats to the shareholders after the passing of the money bill, and before expending the new capital, and he urged Mr. 'Walker not to take any course which would impede or endanger that bilL l£r.

GEAT BEUSTARD v. ISTTLE BUSTARD. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TTIhES. Sir,-Observing by a letter in your impression of to-day that a specimen or the small bustard, and that a female, has lately been killed in Lincolnshire, I ventureto intrade myself on your notice, and to state that a specimen of te great bustard (otfs tardz of Lnn-eus) has recently (3d of anuary inst.) been taken in the neighbourhood of Hungerford, where I reside, and just on the borders of Wilts and Berks. It is a male bird, as can be proved beyond a doubt, ancl is avery fine spcien. I have been to, "Ihat you noticed in 7iel Tmes about three weeks since a circumstance of three bustards having been seen early in the present month near Marlboroughforedt I have heard the same report, but cannot get it confrmed;-andthe P ph in queetion, if it appeard in 2The Times, has esapedmy notice. )ry specimen is oertainly the last of a mae bird taken in England for some yeas, I thin I may say, though female speamens are comparativelyrecent, one havzn" been shot on the open plain between Belston and the Lizard point in 1843 ; see Fraze9s Aagazine for September, 1854, pae 336, whereinithey say, "Thu is the lastinstanoe known to us of the existeuce of this noble species in Great Britain." Mr. William Yarrell (to whom I am indebted for much valuable information respecting the great bustard)notices, however, in a paper -which e rue before the Linneean Society in 1853, that one of these birds ws shot in January, nRonie ytmaranhl, and another in December, 1851, in Devonshire. but these were female birds., My specinen has been seen by Mr. YarreIl, and is in the hands of Mr. Leadbenter for preservation.

THE SIEGE OF KARS.* The story of Kars is now before us. Dr. Sandwith has come like the messenger of thb Greek drama to recount his tale of subversive destiny with the accurate fidelity of an eyewitness and a sufferer. He is the sole visible relic of a painful catastrophe, and we catch eagerly at the tidings he brings US. He was one of the defenders of the beleaguered fortress, its defender possibly in more senses than one, but in respect of want, exhaustion, aud disease he was its chief citadel and its very last bulwark. In the blockaded city endurance mans the breach, while famine and despair press up the glacis. The battle is fought with a drooping pulse, and the contest is deternined by a silent agony. In this extremity Dr. Sandwith strove, under his military chieftain, to the last, and he is now here to teul us how they braved the chilling onset, and how sorely the invisible battle went against them. With the pictures of Kas we are tolerably familiar. That noble panorama, with its crown of mountains and its scarped precipices, is converted in Dr. Sandwith's book into a compact plan, in which we recognize all the positions of any sanguinary repute. Its resources and deficiencies previous to its memorable siege are detailed in the preliminary portion of the work, and the preludes of the final catastrophe in the operations of preceding years are again brought before us with a fascinating distinctness. We are enrightened as to the shameful incompetency of the Pashas who wasted ithestrengthof its naturaldefenders,andwhoshameIfully made a private spoil out of their periL. Amed Pasha, who incurred defeat at Akiska by disjobedience to the orders of his commander, supplanted that officer by mercenary and corrupt agencies. Of the army then imtrusted to his care it was his first business to recoverthe sums he had expended in bribes at Constantinople, and his next to nmake his fortune out of the sufferings of his soldiers. The latter, deprived of food, clothmg, and proper medical attendance, perished in battalions, till 20,000 men had been sacrificed to his ghoul-like rapacity. His army was melting away like a snowwreath, but still the muster-roll went to Constantinople for the pay, food, and appointments of the dead. Ahmed Pasha was at length recalled, and he retired so encumbered with gold and silver that one of his mules scattered its treasures over a precipice near Trebizonde, and he was unable to recover the superfluity of his plunder. Zarif Mustapha Pasha, who had the usuial antecedents of a handsome barber's boy in Turkey, was appointed to succeed him, and under his auspices was fought the battle of Kurekde'e, of which our own columns contained the vivid description of an eye-witness. That battle was mainly lost by the cowardice of the Turkish officers, including their flustered chief, who was unwilling to adopt, or too timid to second, the wise dispositions of General Guyon, his subordinate. The result was the most shameful reverse of the whole war; an army of 40,000 men succumbed to less than -20,000, and their remains fled to Kars, some 18 miles, in one unbroken stream of disorder. This defeat was incurred on the 6th of August, 1854, and on the 24th of September folloaing General Williams, accredited as British Commissioner, entered that city. Happily, he had been employed for years among tlle Turk; and he knew how to manage them. He was a man of business and of decision of character, and he put to rout at once the whole array of chibouljis, barbers, and otlher harpies, under whom the key of Turkey in Asia had been corruptly, as it were, tendered to its inveterate foe. "For example, he would request a review of a certain regiment, which was accordingly drawn up ; the muster-roll was presented to him; 900 men were there in figures,-ho had the men counted, there were but 600. Thus the pay, rations, &c., of the 300 had gone to enrich the Colonel, while the Mushir took his share, and the still higher authorities in Constantinople received a large percentage. " ecalled these corrupt officersto account; hetoldthem of their vilany in plain language, and told them, moreover, that he vas reporting theirmisdeeds to head-quarters. 'urther, he insisted on knowing the amount of rations issued, of forage consumed, and other details. He per. sonaLly inspected the kitchens of the camp every morning, and examined the food of the troops. He regularly visited the hospitals, and did his utmost to learn how the patients were cared for. Lastly, at the approach of winter he exainined in detail every house assigned as winter quarters, and chose the best of them in which to bilet the soldiers. " It Would be impossible to particularize all that General Williams effected; more will appear in the course of this narrative. The Turkish authorities behaved precisely as might have been anticipated; they were guilty, and crouched; they listened to the General's suggestions, and at once acceded to them, trying, of course, to evade them in some underhand way; but they were generally checkmated by one who knew so well the Oriental character. Being all of them more or less implicated, they told tales of each other, and thus assisted, though from very questionable motives, in exposing the vilest firauds. " The virtues of the Turkish private soldiers shone forth wonderfully during all this campaign. They had been illtreated and abandoned by their officers, plundered of their dues, wretchedly clothed and anned, and were many of them 24 months in arrear of pay; and yet the desertions were by no means so numerous as might have been anticipated. Their patience and long suffering, their sobriety and subordination, were beyond all praise; in short, there weretraits observable in them which would mark them out as amongst the best troops in Europe had they fought under better au nces.. o far back as the early part of 1855 the state of the army at Kars filled all who were acquainted with it with the darkest forebodings. The central Govermment appeared to have forgotten its existence. The soldiers were upwards of two years in arrears of pay. They were in tatters suffering from scurvy, mutinous, and disorganized. Desertions had become so numerous, that the province of Sivas alone contained 10,000 men who had left their colours. At the same time it was known that the Russians, under Mouravieff, were making the most formidable preparations for an offensive campaign. General Williams was nevertheless obliged for a time to absent himself to complete other arrangements which it was necessary to make at Erzeroum, while his gallant lieutenants exerted themselves to the utmost against odds and discauragements. Captain Teesdale worked incessantly to secure the wellbeing of the troops at Kars. He was also, with Colonel Lake and Captain Thompson, engaged in fortifying that city, to which General Williams eventually retumed. The latter made an effective appeal tothe Christian population there - " With regard to the Mlussulmans, he knew they were men of courage, and ready to fight to the last. ' But,' he added, turning to tho Christians, ' we look to you also. The time has come when you may shake off your thraldom, and take your place as free citizens ; for the Sultan has granted you privileges, and declared all his subjects equal in tho eye of the law. You will fight, then, for us; take your spades and come and dig with us at the batteries; we illwelcomeryouas brothers.' On hearins these strn and soul-stirring words, the Archbishop started up and e=claimed, ' Oh ! Englih Pasha, we are your sacrifice. We will werk, dig, fight, and die for ynu- since we are no longer doss, no longer Giours, but, tlomgh Christians, fellow-ctizens and free men.' Tae next morn ing theo Trks were astonished at the crowd of Christians assembled with spade and mattock, and still more at the goodvwill with which they worked, and the enduranlce vwith which they continued their labours. D)uring this time I often heard Turkis remark that Williams P2sha worked as no Pashal ever worked before. They admired him extravagantly, but could not understand hi Was he not a pasha 1 Was be not therefore rich; and by his rank and wealth entitled to place, decorations, and everything else? Why, then, should he work like a hammal-a common porter? This was in. comprehensible." In sun, rain, and snow General Williams worked incessantly at his fortifications; but this was his easiest task. He required horses for the conveyance of provisions, and the horses came, but the money allowed for barley on the road had been pocketed surreptitiously, and when these poor animals were most needed they were useless staggering skeletons. Ultimately, he had to become guarantee himself for baggage animals, upon which he obtained a sufficiency ard of a better sort. He himself took into his own hands the whole commis. sariat, and the writer says had he not done so "Kars must have fallen fromnfanine in a week." Dr. Sandwith was appointed at the instance of General Willianms in February, 1855, Inspector of the Hospitals, and, with resources shamefully limited by tho rapacity of the purveyors at Constantinople, it was nevertheless to General Williams's determination in matters of hygiane that he owed in a t measure his own remarkable successes. "We never had (he says) an epidemic of typhus, nor did that enemy of surgery, hospital gangrene2 ever appear; neither in that outpost of civilization had we ever, until the last three days, a single patient without a bed." These are Dr. Sadiith's " distinguished services in the field," and the splendid trophies he obtained even from the valley of death. The first extract which we have from his diary is dated June 1, and tells of the Russian preparations at Gumri. It tells also of the high spirits in which our English officers were prepired to meet their formidable enemy. -Nevertheless, there came bad news on their way to Kars. "Itis said that Schamyl is dead," and ;Mahmood Effendi reports that Kars can rever stand against the force which can now be brougeht against it, and that, as the enemy's cavalry musters 10,000, retreat was not possible. As for their- own cavalry, it was soon ascertained that they might possibly be used for outpost duty, but the idea of their ever being brought to a charge was ridiculous. But " we have a'greater eviltodread-something more imminent still-low be it spoken," says a well informed friend. " I dare scarcely whisper the secret into your ear; we have but three days' ammunition. If Mouravieff advances by approaches, and we fire liberally, in three days we shall be disarmed.?' " God is g,reat," was the answer of the writer; "where ignorance is bliss 'tis folly to be wise." The Turkish regular army amounts to about 15,000 men, "who as yet have only seen defeat," and defeat 3t the hands of antagonists greatly inferior in numbers. In the meantime the enemy are reported within five leagues, their numbers not much less than 40,000, and amply provided with means of transport. " A distinguished citizen" calls on the General, or " Veeliams Pasha," as he is now designated, and Gffers him volunteers on the part of the townsmen, with a prospective crop of " scores of Giaous' heads." The decapitating propensities are, of course, rebuked, but he. and his fellows are applauded and organized. Thus the Russians come insight:- " 3Ionday, June 1L-We are all in the saddle about halfpast3a.m., and ride roundthe works. The troops are cert3idly full of enthusiasm, and Williams Pashi, or Ingleez Pasha, is3already a great favourite. They see him everywhere. He is with the sentries at the menaced point ere the morning has dawned; anon he is tasting the soldiers' soup, or examining the bread, and, if anythig is wrong here, his wrath is terrible. His eyes are everywhere,and he himself ubiquitous. Each soldier feels that be is something more than a neglected part of a rusty machine. He knows he is cared for and encouraged, and he is confident of being well led. Normust lIomit to say that the ilushir, Vassif Pasha, though unused to wass alarms, behaves well, and is only too anxious to follow the advice of General Willians; but the two most gallant leaders among the Mloslems are Ismail Pasha (General Hmety), and Hussein Pasha, a Circassian, both of whom would do honour to any ni-my. While seated with the Mushir, begging him to grant some more supplies for the hospitals, a trooper enters the tenlt out of hbreath from hard riding. lHo saluttes, end announces that the GinouIrs are advancing, and are already vithin three hours of Ears. I gallop off to tell the General the nevrs." Three days later the writer, going on his tour of inspection with Colonel Lake, is enveloped in an attack of Russian cavalry, and with difficuflty escapes. " Some of the sabre cuts received on this occasion were terrific. I saw one man's head as nearly as possible severed from the body." The General writes " a strong letter" to Mehemed Pasha, the Governor of Erzeroum, blaming him for his want of zeal in not sending provisions. There are at the same timefurtmeen pashas at Erzeroum, "two of whom are receiving 5001. a-month," on which, in comparison with their services, the writerrighteously expresses his indignation. On the 16th of June the Russians attempt to rush into the works, but certain "puffs of dense white smoke"' disconcert them. They had chosen for this purpose, with true Russian cunning, ""the very day-the firstof the Bairam, and the very hour-about 9 anm., when the Turks deliver themselves up to idleness and rejoicing, and when all duty is neglected." Happilv there are those in the fortress who have a higher duty than to keep B3airam, and the Russians are repulsed with considerable loss. From the 16th to the 21st various manceuvres on the part of the enemy keep the garrison on the alert. On the 22d they learn that the Russians have sent for siege guns,-an tunwelcome announcement with reference to their scanty stock of amnuanition. Some Lazistan riflemen have comue into the city, an uncertain kind of aid, while the Civil Governor of Kars is plotting against " Veeliams Pasha." The latter calls a military council, sends for the Governor, and, before the superior officers, tells him that he knows all, giving his opinion ." pretty strongly " as to his (the Pasha's) worth in that garrison,and recommendinglhimto be on his good behaviour for the future. The Pasha is frightened and confused, "and, after stammering out a few lies, he disappears." The enemy captures posts and intercepts supplies. On the 26th of June he makes another demonstration; some Bashi-Bazouks come in, but the enemy's blockade draws closer and closer:- " The General and Colonel Lake are incessantly working at the intrenchments, and strengthening every position. They now survey the hills on the west of Bars, beyond Veli Pasha tabia, or Fort Lake, which I have described, and they determine to strengthen these by breastworks and redoubts. The soldiers then set to work with right ood will under the direction of the Mirali Bey, as Co one Lake is called. General Williams pays no less attention to every detail of the camp; sanitary measures, as wel as defensive, occupy his attention ; he makes a desperate attempt to clear the city of many useless months belongting to women and children, but only very partiiallysucceeds in his ob,ject, sincehe encounters the stern resistance of a whole armed population, who, though willing enough to fight, are in nowise disposed either to part with their families or to accompany them out of the city. We are now wofully in the dark as to the enemy's movements; we have no tnustworthy spies whatever. The few peasants who bring us information are more than suspected, while the Armenians of the country are devoted to the enemy's interests." On the 3d and 4th of July some nianoeuvres are attempted, but the writer is convinced that the General is determined " to fight with the spade, since any military manceuvre icith our troops always ends in a muddle." Then occur night alarms and the desertion to the garrison of a colonel of Russian irregulars, whom, to distinguish him from his great namesake, they call the Moscov Omar Pasha. On the 13th and 14th of July there are further " demonstrations." On the 15th there is "a cordon of Cossacks all round us, and a single horseman runs great risk in passing it." On the 17th "a most dismal discovery is made." " We have no barley," the keeper of the stores, Salh Agha, having played false. The men are put upon two-fifths rations of bread, &c., but "we still have provisions to last until the end of Augut." In short, famine has just drawn its first paralleL On July 29 the Laz are insubordinate, for the reason that they are hungry, but they are put in better humour by the sacrifice of a few oxen. The health of the troops continues satisfactory. On August 4 some skirmishing of outposts. On August 6 a demonstration of the Russians in the direction of Erzeroum. On the following day another attack on Ears during MIouravieffis absence. On August 8 a desponding estimate of the sufficiency of " our provisions." " Every one felt these facts weigh heavily on his mind, and al looked to the General, to the 'Ingleez Pasha,' for encouragement. No sign of despondency clouded that honest face; his 'Good morning' salutation was as cheerful as on the morrow of our first little victory. HIe was thin, certainly-he could not well be thinner; but, no wonder, for he never seemed to sleep. Long ere daylight broke he was with the sentries of Tulasp, the point nearest the Russian camp, and his glass learned every movement ; then he was by the side of the Mushir during the greater part of the day; anon, he was encouraging the Bashn-Bazousic and settling their differences, or anxiously =ra~ some planl for feeding the towFnspeople; and, in our liftil.confidential gossips on the stiate of affairs, he would impress on us the duty of maintauining a bright and hopeful bearing, since all the garrison. looked up to us for encouragement." Williams, Thompson, Lake, and TeesdUle, with Kmety, the Hungarian, prove equal to anything. "The Queen has had many a bad bargain during this war, but I doubt whether more admiaMble officers are to be found in the English army than the four I have mentioned." We will ourselves add Dr. Sandwith and Kmety to the tale, though the latter was a Tturkish officer, to mnake up a good halfdozen. The next feats are the hanging of a spy or two, the cutting of some barley in the teeth of the enemy, and the surrender of their cavalry arm, from inability to maintain it. The best mounted horsemen cut their way out. The horses of the remnainder are judiciously taken " to a distance from the encampment," and there have their throats cut. Desertions are now on the increase. 40 men have deserted in a body on the north of the city. Famine is drawing its second parallel; but the news arrives that Omar Pasha will land near Batoum, and a concealed dep6t of corn is discovered; a few days later, in the midst of privations, the garrison hears the news of the fall of SebastopoL I O At 12 oclock all our troops ae paaded, and the good news is read to them; the citizens sallyout wnth their guns, and keep up a constant fesillade. A grand salute is fred from the Castle; but no sooner is the first gmu discharged than a regiment of Russian cavalry, with two batterios of artillery, approach the Hua P'asha fort ontho plain, halt at about ZoOoyards, and fire rapidly; at first this strsnBe sort of attack was inexplicable, until the General said the enemy's intention was clear enoughoh wished to disguise the salute from his own troeps, and give it the appearance -of a cannonade."- September 26th cholera appears, and September 27th cholera increases. There are 42 cases of this disease now in hospitaL On September 28th MIouravieff is expected to raise the siege, but on the 29vth comes thiat grand combiaed awttack the repuMQ d~ 'A £Xarratizvc of thc Sitje of Karg, Recountingthe Six Monh, Resistansc of thc Turkiah Gar-rison, unFder General ,Wittiarns; and Preceded& byTravek and Advendt re. in LZ. zidara, IDid& Remark, onz ttzc Prect State of 2urA:ey.

Two or three days afterwards he is able to say, 'We have buried 6,300 Russians." God knows what else he did, for we can imagine that at that date his time was fully occupied. He has leisure, however, to make a note worthy of the old heroic times.' "Some pious Mussunmans of Kars declare they saw a sacred band of 10,000 men, all clothed in green, the Prophet's colour, fighting with our troops. Those heavenly warriors disappeared when the Russians retreated." Thus Mahomet appeared on the Orontes to overthrow Count Royer; thus Castor and Pollux fought at Lake Regillus; Epizelus beheld such phantoms at Marathon, and the Christian Cavaliers of Spain fighting against the Moslem had a similar help from the arm of Santiago. A still more singular fact, which w,e credit on Dr. Sandvvitli's testimony, wras the temporay disappearance of cholera. " Yesterday and to-day the cholera has ceased-a singular phenomenon, occasioned, I presume, by intense moral emotion." But the cholera was speedily doomed to revive, for the Russians will not retreat. By October the 6th " there is no movement in the Russian camp," and "the deaths from cholera last night amounted in 12hours to 40, exclusive of other deaths." Our troops have " no more animal food," and they have to content themselves with little enough in other respects. We hear that Omar Pasha has taken Kutais, but "We are in somewrhat lowr spirits." "Hope deferred makceth the heart sick," and famine makes its approaches with few engineering difflcultties. The cholera has cut off " about 1,000 of our troops, and is now disappearing, but the nearer enemyisaworse one. Two weeks onlyhave elapsed since our great victory, but our troops suffer so much from their ' diet of bread and water' that they are nolonger the stout and hardy men who fought for seven hours against overwhelning odds, and drove back a magnificent Russian army." The hospitals are filling daily with men, " whose only disease is exhaustion ;" and " exact calculations and elever suggestions" are required to eke out our stock of provisions. Swarms of vultures hover round our lines. The grass is grubbed up in all the open spaces, and the roots eaten by the soldiers and the people; these, however, do not suffice, and famine looks in at the empty embrasures, and begins to peer over the deserted ramparts. A stray load of onions sells for about 5s. a-pound. Keen is the search for corn, frequent are the desertions, but still more frequent, as more honourable, are the admissions to the hospitals. By O:)ct. 28 " horseflesh is a fashionable luxy." On Nov. 2 we find some sugar and coffee, but we have "c no fatty substance of any kind to mix with the soup." The soldiers are grubbing up roots, and 20 of them are brought into hospital, poisoned by eating the roots of tha hyoscyamlts ier. " The troops on Tabmasp look more vigorous than most of the others, since they have providentially secured, from time to time, a dead horse, with which they have improved their soup." "The emaciation is wonderful, yet in most cases no diarrhcea or other symptom of disease is observable. Their voices are excessively feeble, a clammy cold pervades the surface of the body, and they die without a struggle. Several of these men are recovered by the administration of horse-broth, with the application of warmth to the extremities. Surgeons are posted in every part of the camp, with broth of horse-flesh m the form and under the name of medicine. A search is made for strniving horses, and these are secured to make soup for the hospitaL False attacks are made upon our works every night, which, of course, increase the harass of our troops to an almost unbearable extent." By November 10th we have attained the average of about 100 deaths in the 24 hours, from starvation or exhaustion. Horse-broth, as much as we have, recovers some, but the greater number die. Women are seen gathering the dust from before the flour depGts, which contains some portion of flour. People lie at the corners of the streets moaning and drooping. Still the starving soldiers in the batteries stand sentry over three days' provisions, and "1o instauce of their touching a single biscuit hats ever been, knoin." Worse horrors follow. The carcases of buried horses are exhumed and devoured. Retreat is discussed; but retreat is impossible. There are 2,000 men in hospital, and more than 100 dying daily. Naked corpses are found in the camp, for the threadbare clothes of the dead soldier are seized by his shivering comrades. Evil tidings assure us that there is no hope of relief, and in our agony we exclaim, in the langage of Scripture, "In our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us." On November 25 General Williams and his aide-de-camp ride over to the Russian camp, and the terms of the inevitable capitulation are arranged. "'And," here exclaimed General3Iouravieff to the Siecretary, "write that, in admiration of the noble and devoted courage displayed bythe army of KEars, the officers shall be allowed to retain their swords, as a mark of honour and respect," &c. The writer ate. a dinner, which he leaves us to imagine how he en- 4 joyed, and beheld the well-appointed Russian army with a noble surprise. " Are these the battalions that our ragged and hungry handful of men held in check for seven hours, and drove back to their camp 7" Wherefore mustwe now deliver ourselves? England will be inquisitive to know the reason why. But, in the meantime, there isno doubt upon one or two points. "YTteeiims Pasha choc&adon dur" (" Williams Pasha is no eRd'of a man"); so say the Karali, who would have followed him to the death; and as for the writer, we maintain that Dr. Sandwi&h is a noble soldier, and that he deserves well of his country. Hehas borne a memorable part in a memorable siege, and he has told a soldier's story with a soldier's frankness. We have some inquiries, as a nation, to make thereon, but shall we, a month or two hence, as our national custom is, have utterly forgotten himself and his comDanions?
VA lME nF RT.A yRW rr TO THE ED1TOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-A writer in The Times last week, who signs "An American," comrnpm that your copied article, entitled "Y Value of Slave Life," is untrue. It may be. But when he accuses "Abolition journals of settingthrilling stories of the ill-treatment of slaves in circulation to promote their cause," he bears false witness. I am a constant reader of those journals, have long been a contributor to some of them, and was once the editor of one of them. Let me assure you, we never had need to fabricate cases of cruel treatment of slaves. The journals of the Slave States gave us weeldy-nay, daily-more than we could find room for in aU our scanty columns, and they were often instances to ahallenge all the inventions of fancy to parallel. We have in the United States nearly 4,000,00 slaves. The power of the master is. only limited to "life and limb. Not a slave can even testify against any white person, no matter what his crime. b have mminy possession many advertisements for ron-away slaves who are descnbed by letters on their persons. broiled into their flesh with the red-hot branding iron. One of themis a girl named Fanny, 16 or 17 years old, lately branded on the cheek with the letter R, and the same letter is branded on the inside of both her legs. Can Aulstria or Russia beat that? We have also newspapers at our offlces from the South with bloodhounds advertised by their owners to catch ronm away slaves ; and maasters, in other papers (if not the samxe), offer larger rewards for their slaves taken and brought to them dead than if secured alive ! These are not given as rare but eommon instances. I grieve to say it, and wonld not here have said it only to correct the wrong done to a holy cause by your American correspondent. Your usual magnanimlity indnoes me to believe you will ANOTBER AERICAN. Derby, Jan. 2L -

THB GREAT WESTERZV RAILWAY COMPAHY. TO TM EDITOR OF TM TDIS. Sir,-Circumstances have hitherto prevented my noticing the letter of 1A Shareholder," in your columns of the 26th inst. L Allow me to assure him-as a reference to my former letters would show him-that I have not fallen into "the extravaggant error" he attributes to me, as to the point atwhich the narrow gauge stops, "coming south" from Oxford. 2. If anyone will take the trouble to perform the mysterious operation on a Bradshaw's map, suggested by hiim, he wil find that the lines of narrow gauge companies stick like thorns into the north-eastern side of the space to be enclosed; that witbin the area cLaimed by him for tho broad gauge are the lines of the Buckinghamrshire, the Oxford, Worcester, and Wolverhampton, the Bristol and Birminghamn, the Stour Valley, the South Staffordshire, the Shropshire Union, and the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railways, all diverting traffic from the broad gauge; that there is in South Wales a system of narrow gauge lines, only wanting the link between Hereford and Worcester to, be completed, to carry away from the broad gauge the bulk of the traffic of that district; and that in the south, the London and South-Western Railway Company do and will compete for a very considerable share of that territory. His 18,000 square miles, therefore, afford no safe criterion. Althongh, however, of this space, a large area, lying between Cardigan and Wolverhampton, is either monopolized by narrow gauge lines or is wholly anproductive, yet the Great Western Railway Company appear to have spent upon the average 1,175!. per square mile for the accommodation of the district ! Wil "A Shareholder" calculate the return thereon from the next half-yearly accounts? 3. Before "A Shareholder" imports as an argument against laying narrow gauge from Reading to Paddington, that steam coal is produced in South Wales and consumed "in London and the southern ports" he should inquire how many of the southern ports are served by the broad gauge, and of this number how many -would be affected by the operation in question. He would fid-none. With regard to London, I cannot see how this traffic would be more affected on its passage from Reading to London (it must undergo the infliction between Didcot and Reading) by having narrow gauge laid there in addition to the broad, than the Manchester and Southampton narrow gauge traffic would be by the presence of broad gauge in addition to the - narrow between Didcot and Wolverhampton. Andthe suggestion I make, whatever satisfaction it would afford tor " the incursive spirit" (this in a Great Western champion's mouth !) of any one else is one which must result in at least equal satisfaction to the traffic of the Shrowsbuiy lines. 4. While I agree that, if the district they possess be carefully managed, the Great Wetern shareholders will sooner or later earn a good dividend, I say that they will earn it sooner, and a better one when it does come, by my proces3 than by any other. And I confess my utter inability, with my present information, to comprehend either the meaning of "that sort of jobbery which would aim at a third line from Birmingham to London," or of the ilustration drawn by " A Shareholder" from the Manchester, Sheffield, and LincohlIsire Railway. 5. 1 fear 1r. Bronel will not thank his champion for revivingthe cry of danger, as connected with his favourite hobby, the mixed gauge. Engineers are almost unanimous that it simply resolves simply into a question of 2 & d., and in that view of the case are almost unanimous in condemning it. Lastly. I have to apologize for trespassing on your space; which I will not do again. My facts have never yet beex contradicted, nor my arguments answered. As, however, I find from the letter of "A ShareholderP that my views aro: either forgotten or misanderstood by some, and as I amn really anxious that all the trouble I have taken (and I fear given) should not be thrown away, I have reproduced the letters you have been good enough to publsh, with some additions to and expansions of them, together with my opinion as to the proper course to be pursued at the next meeting, in the shape of a pamphlet, which I have intrasted to Mr. Efflingham Wilson for publication, and to which I beg most respectfully to refer all Great Western "Shareholders." I have the honour to be, Sir. INfVESTIGATORL London, Jan. 30.

Wiiam Austin, many yeas in Messrs. Peto, Betts, and Brassey's estabislent, has, since 183, matured a pan teich bas been highly approved by first-rate engineering taent. Tho plan pro posed by~" hi xor its object the accomplishinent of a really permanent railway and enduring structure, extendintg from shore to shore, a distance of 22 miles, and connected at each end wfith the already constructed am! future lines of railroad. It is intended to have a triple way of three arches, oval in forn, and seculy locked together by inseparaMble and indestructble masonry, constructed of approved imperishable material, imhpervious to moisture; and for such unvoidable leakage or collection of w.ater as vill occasionaly occur three efficient culvertswlllbe provided to carry it to each shore, whence powerful lift-pumps would convey it into the sea. The fall is to be from the centre towards each shore, and it is calculated that the crown of the tunnel wl have a thiclmess of chbak of 30 feet between it and the oceasi led at the deepest point, which does not exceed 140 feet below the tidal level, as proved by soundings. There will be three double Ines of railwny (three each way), which Will be ample for ordinary goods trnfflc and express trains. Ample space is afforded for all necessary pathways, and the telegraphic wireswill be laid in the centre, on a new principle of economyand rady access. The tunnel, byits length, wl thoroughly ventilate itself; but should it prove cessary, three, or four, or even more, air-shats can b readily constructed, the npper portions forming lilihthoezses or refu3ge in ease of shtpw;reck, and for signalliug ships in the C,hannel. *Tho cost is estimated at 6)U,0IJU7,OD. and the time for construction seven yeas Th whole of these workis are Droposed to be caried out in connexion owith Mrr.

LOiDON, THURSDAY, JANUARY 31, 1856. We are informed that it is not the intention of Government to furnish to oiuselves or any others of our brethren of the press the outline whicil long observed custom may have led oiur readers to expect of the gracious Speech wvlhieh HEE MAJESTY will this day deliver to her reassembled Parliament. In the wisdom and justice of this decision we entirely acquiesce, and hope that it will become a precedent for future Governments. It is only a due respect and deference to HER MaLzEsTr that the Speech with -which she -will inaugurate the deliberations of Pa.liament shoiuld be known to the country from her own lips, and that a great constitutional ceremony should llot be degraded to the level of the representation of a play, where every spectator has read over in his closet all that he is to hear on the stage. Disclaimning, then, all pretence to any knowledge of the contents of the forthcoming Speechl, we can only presume that the tone adopted by HEE MA£s5TV with reference to the two principal subjects which now oceupy every one's attention-the prospects of peace with Russia, and the pending disputes with the United States-will be pacific and moderate without being on that account the less firm and decided. In the one case we earnestly desire peace; in the other we have the most genuine and unfeigned aversion to war; but neither our desire for peace nor our aversion to war will induce us to forego the objects for which we have taken up arms on the one land, nor to suibmit to gratuitous insult on the other. WVe are conscious of our strength, and able from our existing state of preparation to put it forth at the shortest notice and in the most effective mainer; wYe have shaken off the lethargy of a long peace, and -were never less disposed to surrender to meniace that wvhich cannot be obtained from uts by reasoni or persuasion. The coincidence between the meeting of Parliament and the present state of our foreign relations cannot be regarded as a fortunlate circumistance. The general idea of the duties of Parliament is that they conisist in giving- uitterance to the public sentiments and embodying the public will. The duty which is caled for from Parliament at the present moment is of an exactly contrary character. It is the hardest tasl; wvich can be imposed on a deliberative body-the task of keeping silence on topics the most popular, most interesting, and most attractive. Yet so it must necessarily be. The man who at this time brings forward the questions of peace and war hazards by his presunption or craving for notoriety not only the interests of his own country, but the future welfare of no inconsiderable portion of the human race. The history of all deliberative assemblies proves that the vanity or folly of a few reckless individuals may produce mischiefs which the discretion and pradence of every one else may fail wholly to remedy. The negotiators are to meet within a distance which can be reached in 12 hours twice a-day from the hall in which Parliament assembles. Any indiscretion of language, any intemperance of expression, any unfortunate choice of topics, any question mischievously put and unskilfully parried, will speedily find its echo in the secret but still more important deliberations of Paris. It may be too much to ask from the reckless and enterprising genius of party that it should establish a truce to last as long as the armistice between the belligerent Powers. All that we have a right to claim is that, not in the interests of the Ministry, but in those of the country at large, hon. gentlemen will be pleased to refrain from thwarting in London what is doing in Paris, and carrying the spirit of free debate and hostile criticism into regions where, for a time, at least, the public interest imperatively requires that they should not penetrate. WYhen the negotiations shall be over it will not only be the right, but the duty of both Houses of Parliament, to satisfy themselves that peace has not been retarded by undue exactions, nor facilitated by mean or extravagant concessions. Then the time will come in which Mr. BnR(:n may fairly attempt to persuade Parliament, as he has so easily persuaded the Manchester pacificators, that we were wrong in rejecting the propositions of Russia in April, and degraded for accepting them in January; that nothing which has happened in the Crimea in the meanwhile has in any degree strengthened our position; and that Russia will como out of the war quite as strong, quite as formidable, and with quite as high a character as when she went into it. Then will be the tiue for Mr. GLADSTONZ to demnonstrate how it can, be that a nation so devout and a Government so enlightened as that of Russia has succumbed before the efforts of unibelleving France and Protestant England, and to show how it was right to begin the war, wrong to continue it, right to accept 'adl ternms, andu wrong to press for good ones. Then Mr. HErsERT will have tho opportunity of showing that we ought not to exact from Russia all that she is willing to yield to us, and that: the more politic, as well as the more dignified course, will be to bind over by liberal concessions a great Power which it is imnpossible for our puny efforts long to coerce or control. Then will be the time for Mr. COBDEx to set up lis first prophecy of the " crumpling " up,t" against his second prophecy of the inpossibility of reaching, Russia. Then it will be for Mr. DisRAELi to prove to everybody's satisfaction that we were wrong to make war, wrong to rnake peace, wrong in not making peace, and most wrong of all in not intrasting tlhe solution of the Asian mystery to his own congenial hands. All these things will have their time and their place; all that we say is that their time is not yet come, and. that their place is not yet the House of Commons. There is no reason, however, to tlhilk that, although excluded by prudence and patriotism .from the most popular and interesting topics, the Houses of Parliament need experience any difficulty in finding objects on whicll to expend their industry during the progress of the treaty. If they will orly deal effectually witll the great question of the day-the reformation of our military system, the bringiLg it more completely wuder the control of Parliament, the examination, with care and minuteness, of our war estimates, rendered in their new form, and the discussion of those niunerous ald important administrative questions whiclh sueh an examaination cannot fail to raise, they wvill have made for themselves by industry at the beginning of the session a leisure towards its conclusion which they may well devote to the discussion of European policy and a searching investigation of the negotiations and the events whici led to thnem. If Parliarment wishes to indulge in a succession of vigorous party skirmishes during the end of the session, it must be content to earn its amusement by getting through some of its drudgery beforehand; for, should the earlier part of the session be wasted, as usual, in niaking specches, only substituting second-rate for first-rate topics, Parliament will be driven to the alternative, as slummer advances, of leaving its business tinfinished, or its party quarrels unfought,-the first of wvlhicll wvould be a restult most lamentable for the country, and the second most distastef-ul1 to itself. With very few exceptions, to which it were invidious iiow to recur, the country has had every reason to be satisfied wvith thie ianmner in which party feeling has been sacrificed by our senators to public interest, and the support which all sides of the House have comrbined in giving to the prosecution of the war. It is only for a little while longer that we have to ask a continuance of this generous forbearance, and we feel no doubt that the country, in whose behalf we ask it, will not plead in vain. Wve are at present successfull over our enenies, and all that is required from us is that we shoulld gain a similar triumph over ourselves. The country has confidence in the hands in which our de5tinies are placed, and the greater part of the House of Conmuons has, we believe, the same confidence as the country. Those.who differ fronm the imIaLss of th.eir fellow-countrymen are not lil;ely to brilng them over to their way of thinking by intruding their dissent at a tinle when it will be doubly unpopular as being the opinion of a minority, and of a miniority acting in opposition as well to public interest as to public opinion.
There is a great deal of political wisdom in this country of so transcendental a nature that we may as wleU honestly confess we do not understand it. The professors appear to be conscientious and even enthulsiastic; they are even eloquent and entertaining; nevertheless, they take us at once out of the vale of human life, and invite us to a little world of their own. W'hen a man tells us that if, on the first blustering of the late CzAR and his ambassadors, we had backed out of the scrape, and let him send his ships to the Bosphorus, and take possession of the Turkislh empire, the rest of Europe would have been ouite as safe from Russian aggression as it is at this monient, we can only regard the assertion as a paradox of wvhich we do not possess the key. Wlere it not so critical an affair, and could the experiment be tried, -we will suppose, in a coalpit, or w ithin walls of safe thickness, we should really like to see the promise put to the proof, if only for lthe a;lvancement of political science. But the isbk is too fearful. Swimi's conjuror would undertake to put a red-hot poker into a barrel of gunpowder in tha muidst of a crowded company; to throwi up any ladays child into the air, and receive it on the point of a bayonet; and do any imunber of equally astounding and perilous 'feats, if the conipany-if the child's mamma-would only permit him. These undertakings are so frequent, and regarded witlh sa mucil just apprehension, that the comuaon sense of mankind encounters theni with the proverb, "Fiat exerihnoduin inw corj)orev ii." In fact, the conjuror is requested to try his hot poker on an ounce of loose powder, or at a respectful distanca; and to catch a dogt or a rabbit on his bayonet, with impunity, if he can. In these days we don't even try poisons on convicts; we risk the lives of frogs and the comfort of cats. But, if a fellow assured us that by tying a contrivance of his round our boots we could step over the parapet of Vaterloo-bridge without unpleasant consequences, we should wvait till somnebody else had shown the way. In public affairs it is fortunate that there is suclh a variety of great and small matters, that we have the opportunity of measuring a mau's soundness of intellect in cases where the cost is not great. When a man shows that in the merest trifles, which, trifles thouigh they are, yet come within the cognizance of our senses and experience, he has peculiar notions of cause and effect, we take the hint and demur to his most confident anticipations in more serious affairs. On the very serious question of the war Mr. 31. GresoN assured his constituents the other day that he had never taken the hobgoblin view. He had never entertained any fear that the nations of the West would be overrun by the nations of the East. He considered it far more probable that the free opinions of the West would gradually pervade the regions of the East than that the physical force of the East would put down the West. Of course, in proclaiming this delightful confidence in the vitality of Western freedom to lesist Eastern despotisrn. Mr. M. GiDsox did not confine the prospect to his own days. He did not expect to see the question decided finally one way or another with his own eyes, like the man who, having heard that a raven would live a hundred years, bought one to see whether it would. This can only be a question of tendencies, of progress, of steps this way or that, of ground gained this way or that. These gradual changes, too, in one direction or another, can only be ascertaine1 by fact, by a successful resistance, a decided stand, or, on the contrary, a positive defeat, a manifest yielding, a surrender of vantage ground. A conflict of nationalities and political systems is not a dispute in the high regions of philosophy; it is not a mere battle of word& and ideas about the inhabitants of the stars or the destiny of the universe; about the origin of evil, the freedom of the will, the nature of happiness, or the siwit)tt1umu bonujm. (n- itese quesiiitr can imagine an immense victory, a whole- race of philosophers routed and slain, without one -iitWard sign, except in speeches and books. We can imagine a magnificent theory, like the Ptolemaic system of astronomy, -beleaguered, breached, bombarded, assaulted, taken by storm, and no quarter given, all bypen, ink, and paper, wvithout a man even changing his place. But " the physical force of "the East" has not confined itself to anyideal realms or to bloodless feats of authorship. W Ie, in England, upstarts as we are, count it a very new family indeed in which a man's grandfather was the first gentleman of the race. That is to go back a century. But vwithin a less space of time Russia has extended her dominions a thousand miles towards Lapland, a thousand miles towards London, and a thousand miles towards India. It is but five short years since all our Lberals, the very people who met at Manchester the other day, were up in arms,: or rather openmouthed, at the critical aid she had given in restoring a tottering despotism in the heart of Europe, in setting at nought "the free opinions 4" of the West," and rivetting the chains of a struggling nationality. V-ll IMr. L Giwsox now tell.us that was nothing' If he has never had anything to fear for the West of Europe, had he nothing to deplore for Hungary? Is his complacency for the past equal to his security for the future ? Have the vulgar deeds of 100,000 Russian bayonets in Transylvania been fully and satisfactorily redeemed by a triiunph of mind somewhere in the world of ideas? Away, 1M.I; MIT-NER GiRsox, with your " free opinions of " the WYest." Free opinions must fight for it, or they will no longer be free. W'hen the free opinions of Greece went out and did battle, not only with DAnrus and XEFxEs, but also with the tyrants of the East on their own soil, they stood their ground; when they only made speech',es and w-rote books they were swept away. Russia has for a hundred years been steadily advancing upon Europe, taking cvery opportunity of planting her foot on new ground, and never withdrawing it. Nobody shall persuade us that the torrent of lava we see moving onw ards will stop ere it reaclhes us with no effort on our part. It may not be in our time. It is not in one man's lifetime that a hundred nations are swallolwed up in one great empire. But, though the game is long, it is a sure one, if " free " opinion" confines itself to the operations of the mind, the performances of the study, and the still more vapid achievements of the platform. But the champion wvho tells us we shall overrun Russia vith free opinions faster tlhan 0we can repel her vith arms, and that, in fact, the war has done nothing to promote the liberty of aly nation in Europe, has, happily, given us a test of his discernment in a rery small affair which happens to concern ourselves. Indeed, with the most engaging simplicity, he prefaces his pledge as to the strength of free opirions against bayonets and cannon balls uith some notice of his own failure, -where free opinions might be supposed rather more at home. Last session he took a prominent part in "nu1taxing," the press of thlis country. In so doing his avowed object was to raise up a press that more directly represented the free opinions of the coiunty at la.ge, and his scarcely concealed object was to o0-eltlirow what he chose to regard as our monopoly. As we are too rauch interested to be listened to in the matter, let Mr. M. GirxsoN and M.Ir. Btrc.mT state the results for us. The former gentleman " had been asked the "other day vwhat good that measure had done, and "had been told by an eminent statesman that he "thought Government had been very weak in giving "up 250,000l. of annual revenue, wlhen incone was "so much wanted, by the repeal of the Newspaper "Stamp." All the answer 31r. l1L Gmsox could malke to this was, that though the measure had done some good it woul1d do much more when Government had given up about a million more revenue in the same direction. WVe shall not comment on this reply, but wve will ask wlhere is the new press that t]is measure was to call into existence ? WVhere are those " free opinions" which Mr. MS. GRssofiids so rn-represented in these columns? Never was the British press so unanimous as it is against him on the question of the war. And if there be any monopoly,-if there ever was such a thing,if, in the most open and public rivalry in the world, there could be any exclusive privilege, then, how has it been affected by 1r. M. Gusoy's measure for cheapening and facilitating competition-for creating, in fact, a thousand rivals and depredators? See the result in MIr. BRIGH'S speech. Wlhy, he could hardly have made more of Us if we were the only newspaper in the world! It might, indeed, be supposed that wewere an estate of the realm, with as high and indefeasible a privilege as either House of Parliament, and above both of the. Had it been we, and we alone, who declared war against Russia, and waged it to this day, we could not have come in for a larger share of MIr. Bntc.rr's delicate attentions. Such is the effect of a measure designed to destroy a monopoly-at least such its non-effect-and such the political sagacity and prescience of the man wlho advises Europe to meet wvith fiee opinions the physical force of the East.
At this moment England has no representative at the Coiut of Teheran. The natural inquiry is, swhat cause has led to a rupture which in Europe would be considered either as an insult or a menace? Is it that Persia has aided the CzA on the Armenian frontier, or giveni him further rights on the Caspian? Is the capture of ierat, or any piratical misdeed in the Persian Gulf, implicated in the quarrel? It may be answered, to the surprise of the questioner, that this is only a personal affair. Mxr. MIURRAY, the English Envoy, has had a dispuite with the SAD.a, or Persian Prime Minister. The subject is a native scribe in the service, as it seems, of any office or embassy that would pay him; the result is the departure of the British representative from Teheran, and the time chosen for the rupture is the epoch of the fall of Kars, the renewed efforts of Russia for supremacy in Asia, and the final struggle between the Cz-n and Western Europe. It must be evident to every one that when a Minister leaves on his own responsilbility the Court to which he is accredited there lies on him thebturden of proving tiiat his retreat was inevitable, and that any other course would have compromised the honour of his own Sovereign. Now, what is the case, as stated by a writer apparently acquainted with it, and strongly in favour of the English Envoy ? A Persian official has a dispute with his suiperior. The world is beginning now to comprehend what Eastern bureaucracy is; but the corruption of Constantinople can give only a faint notion of the corruption of Teheran. Wrhether 3mrzA H&simz was right or wrong is involved in obscurity. It is only stated that he wanted more pay, and made an enemy in consequence. But 3r. luxsRA, finding him among the traditional hangers-on of the British Legation, resolved to uphold him. He gave himu a mission to a distant province, and wws grievously offended when the SADR refused to HAsirs permission to depart. Some of the wretched scandal which always hangs about the streets of an Eastern city came to Mr. MuiP-y's ears; the SADP had said, or somebody had said for him, that HASbnes wife was mixed up in the affair. MIr. Mun&x's dignity ia insulted and he at once retires in anger from TeheranL In spite of the letter of "YEVsuA" we cannot Vu-iirepeat -tLe assertion tiat -te'retreat ofM1r. Monajy was at least' precipitate. It will be well if ,this should be the greatest blame -thstpublic opinion will attach to his conduct. Mr. MuTci*was sent to Persia at a crsis in Easterm history. The defeat of the Turks in Asia; 'the equivocal policy of the' Persian Court, the doubtf I siege of Sebastopol, all required that the rep-resentative of England should be a man who united forbearance with -firnriess, and least of all nixed -up the petty perSonal insults to wvich Orientals are addicted with the real injuries which he wis sent to ward off from the alles. It must never be forgotten that for England, at least, Persia is--a more permanent battle-ground than Turkey itself. This M3ahomedan State lies between the Russiain and Anglo-Indian empires. It is connected by history, by customs, by commercial relations closely with our own North-wpstern Provinces. - E we are to reap from this war thte advantages that our critics always declare us to be seeling for, then it is necessary that we sholda have at Teheraii a representative who will make known at all timec the read state of affairs, impress on a feeble Court an idea of the full power of England, and efface by constant, though not obtruded, advice the reprsentations of Muscovite diplomacy. It is difficult to say whether any great question will arise during the present rupture; but, if anythi,g could lessen the justification of 31r. Mcur.Ay, it -would be a passage in the letter which defends hin. 'VERAx" says that "only confidence prevents "him from declaring what influences wvere at work "to foster dissension between the SHAH and the English Einister." Wve can well inagine such influences in action now and always; but it was surely the duty of MIr. AIuRnnky, 'who must have seen that his retirement wvould be their greatest triumph, t) remain at his post and frustate then: by vigilance and activity. 2-'o fancied assertion of dignty wvill balance the loss nwhich a period of uncontrolled Russian influence may briig to the British name. Thus viewed, even through the colouring of a fiiendly statement, the conduct of the English MEnister is indefensible. If in the polluted atmosphere of an Eastern city a politici allows himself to be inveigled into relations vwith native schemers he must soon be brought into dissension andc difficulties. The representative of a great Power should be especially cautious to distinguish bet-een his own piivate connexions and those which he forms as the delegate of his country. What right has any one trusted with the concerns of a great enmpire to suspend his functions on account of' any fancied injury to such a person as TIZA s uASHII? The truth is, apparently, that lIr. 1MunAY, like many other newly appointed diplomatists, has been led away by the staff which he found onf his arlival, and has allowed hiuself to be mixed up with their predilections and jealousies. If he can, without a lowering retractation, again renew his relations with the Persian Court, it will be well for him to lose no time; if he hag suffered any real insult, it wil be the duty of the Govermuent, after examiining the question and demanding satisfaction vhere it is due, to take on itself the responsibility of again sending a representative. At all events, Eng,land camot remain without a Minister at Teheran. Though Persia may be the Prussia of the East, and may by vacillation stalnd excluded from direct participation in the renewled negotiations, yet her policy must be always a matter of interest, and' the welIlbeing of our Asiaftc empire depends on the well-preserved influence of a high-spirited and yet not irritable Minister.
It is much to be regretted that there is not soma: -imple and effectual method for dealing with dis- orderly clergymen. There are, ve believe, some17,000 persons in holy orders-we are speaking, of course, of the Church of England-and a few of the number give great scand.al bv the indecency and impropriety of their lives. It is needless for us to say that they are but a very small percentage of the whole, and that in the umain the English clergy are most pious and exemplary; but the c-xceptions exist, for all that. Now, in the few remarks w-e are about to offer upon this subject we must disclaim all idea of intending what is calledl "an attack uponl the Church." So far from this, we believe we are representing the views of the great mass of the clergy. They are compelled to endure evils which they, most of all men, deplore, because there is -want of authority and jurisdiction. Give themn the power of purging the Church of her offending ministers, and there will soon be little room for scandallittle cause of offence. It is because their hands are so tightly bound that excesses prevail. Now, there is no chance of any real remedy until -we all admit to its full extent the existence of the eviL So long as we go on applying salve here-hushing up an enormity there-and esteeming it a kind of sacrilege to speak above our breath of the vices of clergynen, there is no hope of effectual reformation. Let us, on tle contrary, look the evil boldly in the face, and we shall soon find a cure. It is not surprising thst instances of loose life should occur among the clergy when we consider that many of the number ta3 e upon themselves the soleimn engagements - of the ministry ratlher nith a view of securing a comfortable provision for life than under stong feelngs of devotion and self-sacrifice. There is the family living, which must not be suffered to pass away from the family. The eldest son takes the estate according to customtlhen JA.cK must take orders ana the living; but that yoiug gentleman prefers a commission in the Dragoons. RAnny, the next brother, then drifts down to the rectory and the family living, having, by way of preparation, spent his youth at a public school and at one or other' of the UYniversities amid gay companions of his own age. No doubt, in inniunerable instances such persons turn out most admirable and excellent clergymen; but there are exceptions. We are sometimes left to regret that HARBB did not follow the example of his brother JAcK, and take a comuission in the Emnisldllens too, in place of assuming the holier functions. When once in holy orders he is well nigh beyond all control from the superior clergy. It is only in extreme c,,es and after the most repeated offences, that the Bishops or the Ecclesiastical Couftta can interfere; and even when the interference takes place the sontence which follows npon conviction is generally so slight as to appear rather a mockery than a serious proceeding. In other professions this case is different. In . the army or navy, of course, a drunken or disorderly officerwould soonbe cashiered. Withregard tothe medical profession, the public are their own police. If Dr. YDIIRARG presented himself in a state of intoxication at the bedside of a patient, or if Mr. TovumMQvxr with reeling brain and insteady fmiger trifledwith an artery, the news would, fly Ele wvildfire through the dishicts in which they practise, and their vocations wouild soon beat --an end. There is less of discipline exercised over the Bar, but even there the Judges, and Benchers, and Bar-Messes do something which is more effectual than the utmost which the weak guardiani of clerical morality can accomplish. Besidae, it is not expected-however it may be desired-that a lawyer shoul' present in

FRANCK I (MoM oUR OWE caOBEsorn,ssUT.) PAP1S, TUESDAY, JAN. 29, 6 P.3L The despatches of the Russian Govermment, completing and confirming the telegraphicannouncement of the unconditional acceptance of the Austrian propositions, v.ere received in Vienna on the 2Sd, and, as couriers were soon after sent to London and Paris, it is certain that the French and English Governments have received theirs. These despatches are described as perfectly satisfactory, and, if we had to deal with a Power know-n for its good faith and sincerity of purpose, it would not be possible to entertain a doubt that an honourable peace is on the point of being concluded. The protocol embodying the propositions has been signed at a Vienna, and has already been received here and in London. The preliminaries of peace, which, according to diplomatic usage, are usually signed in some neutral place, will be signed in Paris. Those who conduct the negotiations, and who at the same time are members of Cabinets, will be considered as first Plenipotentiaries on the occasion. I have heard it stated to-day, on the aluthority of a diplomatist, to whom the public, erroneously as I believe, gives credit for having played anL important part in these proceedings, thiit the Plenipotentiaries will meet in Paris on the 17th of February, that very little tine will be lost in discussion, and that the whole wiU be brought to a conclusion by the 25th. I do not vouch for the correctness of the statement, but if it be niot coirect it ought to be so. Mlatters should be arranged so that neither the Austrian nor Russian Plenipotentiary should have hereafter the shadowr of an excuse for delay on the ground of applying for fresh instructions from home. The moment such a pretext is alleged you may dcpend upon it that trickery is intended. There shoulcd now be no points on which misunderstanding can arise. Nothing can be more clear, more precise, than the propositions which Russia has accepted; there has been quite time enouglh for the removal of all doubt and difficulty, and the Plenipotentiaries ought to assemble inParis less for discussion than for the niere formality of signing. No one will object to give such of them as are foreigners a few days to see the curiosities, if they are so minded; but work should precede amusement, and even eight days is. a large margin. If relimace can be placed on the authority I have just referred to, everything has been already arranged. Tott ira sur des roulettes. Everytling wears the appearance of conleur de rose, and we are asked to believe that even the Archduke Constantine himself, wvho -as thought to be the incarnation of Scythiau ferocity, is now as meek as a iamb, and that he sees, feels, and confesses that his coiuntry wants repose, and that he is far more pacific than his brother Alexander, and not less sincere. Is hope so. If every one is sincere, if everything is accepted beforehand without mental reservation, a favourable and speedy result is certain. The following priv-ate telegraphic despatch has been received:- " HAMBUIRG, JtN. 2S. "Count Reventlow having proposed an address to the King of Denmark, claiming a guarantee of the sacred fights of the Duchy of Holstein, a strong majority of the Holstein Diet adopted it. "The Royal Commissioner, having vigorously opposed this address, immediately quitted the hall. " The dissolution cf the Diet is considered as probable. " The War Department in Sweden has just drawn from the Treasury 1, lO0,OOf., to be applied to the urgent defence of the kingdom." The third and fourth volumes of the works of the Emuperor Louis Napoleoni have just been published. They are by far the most interesting volumes, az they are the conclusion. The third volume contains the letters, speeches in the Assembly, addresses to the electors before the nomination of the Emperor to the Presidency of the Republic, as also hiis letters, proclamations, messages to the Assembly, and speeches in public from the 20th of December, 1849, to the date of the coup d'dtat, 2d of December, 1851, and from this date the allocutions, &c., of thc Emperor to the day of the entry of the Imperial Guard on its return from the Crimea. The Emperor had made sonue progress in a large wtork entitled Duc Passe et de ItA4reuir d.e l'A.ticlerie, but, not having as yet time to complete it, the fourth volume now published contains copious extracts froml his MS., and may, in fact, be considered as a COPiOUS sulmmary of the large w ork. It gives the history of that invention from 1328 to 1638, and the effect produced by it in the many battles in wFhich firearms wrere ulsed beta-ecu those periods. The publication has excited a good deal of interest here, as, independent of the exceptional fact of a Sovereign publishing his own works, people are curious to ascertain from them the secret springs of the Imperial policy. The subjects he treats are various; history, politial economy, the military fore, Lc., are confessedly handled wfith a talent w hich iS not found among professional w;riters. The alliance between France and Eng,land imparts an additional interest to the work. It is said that the Emperor has ordered presentation copies to be sent to a munberof his friends, both here and abroad. Cours Authentiqur.-PsAns, Jan. 29.-Cash Prices.- Four-and-a-Half per Cents.

It is possible, nay probable, that some part of the intelligence contained in this letter wil be forestalled; but authentic details are always welcome ! to British newspaper readers, and therefore a con- nected account of what has happened during the last day or two will now be given. As you have already been informed, a kind of protocol of what had occurred was drawn up at St. Petersburg, and signed or "paraphed*" by Count Nesselrode for Russia, and Count Valentine Esterhazy for Austria. A copy of the document arrived here on the 24th, and other copies of it were on the same day forwarded to Paris, and, as I believe, to London. The Russian Government has also expressed certain wishes in respect to the future preliminaries of peace, and one of them cannot fail to wound the pride of this Cabinet. Russia desires -1st, that the preliminaries of peace be paraphed in this city by the representatives of the four Powers; and, 2dly, that they-the preliminariesbe signed in the capital of France. It is not clear wvhy Count Nesselrode should desire to have the ! preliminaries paraphed here; but it is evident that when he expressed a wish that they should be signed in Paris he intended to kill two birds with one stone-to cajole the belligerent, France, and to slight the mediator, Austria. The Russian Govemment has also expressed an ardent desire " to conclude peace as speedily as possible," but a story may be told in various ways, and therefore you will perhaps do weUl to accept my version of the words quoted, which is, that Russia is extremely impatient to have the preliminaries signed without delay, because she wants, by means of an armistice, to tie the hands of the allies. It is also stated that Russia, in. order to flatter the Fimperor of the French, will agree to Paris as the seat of the future peace conferences, which the diplomatic world affects to consider a mere con- * The meaning of the dipIomatic expred aIo Paraphed" is, that the initiaIs of the parties concerned nare ataced to a documeat. tinuation of those held -in this city sonlem ten months since. In a former letter it was obgervedthatnoPowerhadprofited bythe warbutAustria, and few persons are likely to call in question the Justice of the remark; but the Prussian papers say the thing which is not when they affirm that she (Austria) has " made no sacrifices" in order to attain her end.s. Although Austria has not been actively engaged in the war, her hostile demonstrations against Russia have oost her full 200,000,O00fl, and some 35,000 men, who were last year carnied off by cholera and typhus in their eantonmnents in GalEcia. On the other hand, the Vienna papers indulge in a little innocent rhodomontade when they affirm that Austria would have taken the field in the spring if Russia had not accepted her propositions. The denarture of Cornt Valentine Esterhazy from St. Petersburg would probably soon have been followedl by the signature of a military convention with the Western Powers, but it is notorious that Aulstria could not, even if she would, place the 3d and 4th aruies on a complete warfootng in less than five or six months. In order not -unecessarily to excite public opinion in England, but little notie has been taken in my correspondence of the abusive artieles which have recently appeared in the Vienna papers, but the Ost-Deidsche Post of to-day has a short leader, whieh must be given, as the paper in question has Mlinisterial inspirations:- '" We learn that the document containing the acceptance of the Austrian propositions reached this city on the 24th. It was from the Russian Iuperial Chaucellerie. Thenecessary materials for the preliminaries of peace are therefore in order, and the signature of the same cannot be long deferred. It is possible that in England wishes are entertained wihich go beyond the four points-it is posssible that many interests which are not mentioned in the four conditions require attention; but these are matters which cannot in the least interfere with the signature of the 'prelininary protocol,' as the honour- of France and England are engagedL Questions relative to interests may be settled at some future. time, but matters of honour admit of no delay. The British press may occupy itself with the former, but the British Government must hasten to settle the latter. Lord Palnerston knows better than 277e Times or the Post wvhat lie is engaged to by his notes. It niay be the question of Bomarsund, Anapa, and the Black Sea Consuls in the couicilchaniber at Brussels or Franldort-but the fifth point can be no iunpediment to the signin g of the prelimiiinaries of peace. It may be a matter of opinion wvietherLord Palmer. ston in hiis policy likes straight or crooked paths, hait no one dare doubt that England's First linAiter is a gentleman who will pay hiis bill when due." By my fosuner letters you have learned the nature of the obligatiosis of Englanld towxards her allies. The British Cabinet is certainly morally bound to sign the preluninaries of peace as they now stand, althsossgh the EarlofCiarendonl did not" paraph " the revised Austrian propositions, ns M. deas aleski did. It is not believed that Prince Gortschakoff will be present at the peace conferences as the Plenipotenltiary of Russia. The diploniatist in question has throughout the whole affair carried the flag of his native country so very high that it wvould be to insult him to ask him to lower it. The official paper -which consents to do the dirty work of the Catholic hierarchy to-day informs the public that the Journal dc FranAfort and the Deut'sce Allgemeine Zeitua9 told " a most wicked lie " -when they pat expressions unfavourable to tise concordat into the mouth of the Archbisliop of Vienrna. It is currently reported that the Mbinister of Justice is about to prohibit the sale of a work entitled "A A Catcclism Belatirc to Protestantisin and Catholicismn, for the Use of the People," by Dr. Perronie. The book has fallen into ny baiids, and it is evident to me, that if thme Goverunent wishes to bring about a religious conflict betwveen its Catholic and Protestant subjects, it has only to allow Dr. Pelroume's production to circulate freely. The Catholic Calendar, of vhieh mnention was made yesterday, was confiscated by order of the supreme policc at the request of a civil court of justice. The Protestants and Jews intend to prosecutte the author of the work, a certain Dr. Jarischi, who is said to be an arch-Jesuit, and is Imperial Royal Inspector of Schools in the Crown lands of Styria.

The Bursen Zeitung of this evening states:- ' We hear from a reliable source that the negotiations as to the admission of Prussia to the peace conferences are now formally opened, that France has dropped the objections whicl she had at first raised, but that England continues to make the same difficulties as before." I do not imagine that the state of the case is exactly as here stated; but. as regards the merits of the case, Prussia camlot join in any obligation to compel Russia to accept this or that, but she can join in a guarantee that Russia shall not be allowed to depart from what she has herself already accepted.
MILITARY EDUCATION AT WOOLWICH. TO THEE EDITOR OF TEHE TIMES. Sir,-A strong argument having been brought forvard bv the "REdiazburghReviewcer," founded on the non-appearance of any letters from the parents of those who have been educated at Woolwich, I trust that your impartiality will accord me sace mn yonr columns for a few remarks on this subject. |'ai induced to make them, because I feel that a debt of gratitude is due from me to the head of that establishment for the excellent education that my son received at their hands. I am quite aware that there vas a time when the article in Houseaold Words was fully justified by the bad state of discipline in the academy, but, owing to the judicious exertions of the officers in charge, a very different state of things was brought about; and I beleve to Lieutenant-ColonelWilmot a large share of praise is due for the improvement. My son joined the 3Elitary Academy in February, 1852. Not very long after that time General Lewis succeeded General Parker as lieutenant-governor. Bullying had almost ceased, and may be fairly said to have become obsolete shortly after that period. I have no reason to suppose that there was any want of care with regard to the moralPs of the cadets; the number of delinquents was as small as could reasonably be expected from amongthat number of lads; and I can testify that myson, with a full share of animal spirits, never got into any scrapes, or showed any signs of moral contamination. With regard to the theoretical part of the education, embracing, as it does, history, geography, modem languages, chymistry, geology, and astronony, in addition to a very large amount of mathematics and military science, I consider a cadet, at the period of receiving his commission, to be better fitted even for civil appointments than a large majority of yong men of his age, except, of couae, mhen a knowledge of the classics is required. With regard to the practical part, they gain a thorough knowledge of the use of firearms, from a carbine up to the heaviest ordnance, together with the constr action of field-works, surveying, &c. Thei physical powers are pretty well tested in manoeavrn with their own field pieces, andin their lengthened ruas with their carbines. Cadets may have been received "not very highly-gifted " but, though some may be crammed for the sufficiently severe examination for admission,, most of the weakest are weeded out at the periodical examinations, and all of them would be, were a little more care taken to pro vent their receivinw assistance from the mistaken generosity of their more giftea companions. But the real question after all is,-Have the officers of Artillery and Engineers been found deficient in miatary and general knowledge and in high moral conduct? I say emphatically, no. Letthe conduct of the Artilleryat the Alma. their energy in bringing up the two 18-pounders at Inkermann, and their wefldicted fire speak. Let the stats of the Ordnance corps during the disasters in the Crime X speak. Let the siege works before Sebastopol and thi crushing fire of the guns and mortars speak; and let us no' foret williamsand Tesdale,bothArtilleryofficers. Then, '..ith renard to the moral conduct of the officers of these corps. Where is the practical joking, where tho courtsmartial, where the appearance before police-magistrates and bankruptcy courts? Such occurrences are so rare tha' they may be fairly said not to exist. By all means look to the discipline of the Academy, but do not destroy a system of education which has produced such excellent results. Prom three to four years is not too long a time for the training of an Ordnance officer. That the officers of those corps are not highly educated and practical soldiers, and high minded gentlemen withal, I defy any one to prove. The weakest point in ourmilitary system la the want of a staffi corps thoroughly educated for that purpcose. Let our energies be rather diected to secure this peat necessiht instead of being wasted in condemning an institution whi;ch, with some faults, has not failed in securing the efficiency of our corps of Artillery and Eneineers. v. v U.

The kingdom of Oude is about to be sequestrated, the King to be allowed 100,0001. a year, the army to be reduced from 80,000 to 15,000 ; the entire administration of affairs to be intrusted to the Resident, General Outram. The settlement of the Oudeypore differences, which renders the political agent supreme, has dissatisfied the chiefs. The native Princes, whose admninistration is admitted to be blameless, are endeavouring to obtain some better security than they have hitherto enjoyed for the retention of their donilnions. "The charges of the Indian niavy are about to be increased from half to close on a million sterling annually, onc-fourth the revenue of the Presidency, andtwo-thirds the charges of our armyof 60,O00men. " Lord Canning is expected at the Presidency on his way to Calcutta a fortnight hence; the present Governor-General retires on the 1st of March, after an administration of eiclet years' duration. " A fair business has been done in the import market; money is scarce, and exchange has advanced." CHINA. The intelligence from China is unimportant. lVe extract the following from the Orcrsand Frice?o of China of December 15th:- *' At Canton there has been another extensive fire ; singularlv, again onthe site of the fire in 1S52. There are now three large spaces in tlle vicinity of the factories caused by fies wvithinthe last twelve months-one in the Taiping war, close to the city walls, another (the last) some half-dozen houses only in rear of the foreign factories, and nearly from end to end of them, and a third space to the wvest, close to the Shameen landing-place. WTe believe the-whole of these fires have been the work of incendiaries. - Trade in Canton in old teas during the month has been brisker than it has been for some timie. Of newv teas but few have been brought to market, and operations have been lnmited. " In Hongkong there has been what Americans would call 'an indign3tion meeting,' deprecatory of an attempt by Governor Bowvring to take away the peculiar benefit of marine lots, by running a public parade in front of them, -which parade his Excellency thinks should be made, for tlle benefit of the imblic, by the holders of the marine lots, so requiring from them an outlav of an average of 1,000!. sterling per 100 runling feet. This requisition -vas too modest, and in dis utation of its legality, has been rejected. One of the benefits to he derived from the construction of this rarde, accord in, to Government would be increased facilities for poice purposes. Oar police force and system, however, are so notoriously inefficient, that merchants prefer guarding their sea frontages; and even witlh such additiona guarding they are niot safe, as evidenced in an organized attack on 3Iessrs. Wardley and Co.'s offices, a few nights ago, aud successful escape of the burglars with about S3,C0 in cash, not a policeman being found for half an hour afterwards. - The failure of several Chinese shroffs at Shanghai, followed by the suspension of Messrs. Aspinwall, Mackenzie, and Co., with liabilities, it is said, exceeding 150,0056., has caused sometliing liLe a panic in that quarter. " Our table of latest dates is as follows:-Japan, Nov. 1tl!; Pekin, Nov. 12th; Shanghai, Dec. Sth; Canton, Dec. 12tl." COBIYERCIAL IN-TELLIGENCE. THE BOMBAY MARKETS. FROM THv 17rv DEC-nIBER, 1855, TO 1ST JASUAR5, 1856. The overland imail of the 26th November, per Peninsular and Oriental steamer Ganges, arrived here on the 22d of December. The tightness in our money-market during the fortnight has increased considerably, and the banks since our last report have raised their rates of interest 1 percent., with every prospect of a further advance. Government and other securities are almost unsaleable, and in consequence pries have given -vay materially from our previous quotations. Li-port Mlarket.-A fair amount of business has been transacted during the past fortnight in cotton fabrics, but we regret to say at a further concession in price, holders seeming desirous of disposing of their goods to avail of the very favourable rate of exchange on London, which in some measure conmpensates for the decline noticed. Cotton Yarn.-The market continues very dul, and, with a pressure to sell, prices have declined for both mule and water. Dyed orange aid Turkey reds duU; greenin mode- rate inquiry. Exror3s. Coffee.-The snpplies in the market are scarce, but we do not observe any change in value either of Mocha or Malabar. Pepper reinahus unchanged in value, and the denmand is good. Coclhineal and saffron are dull, and have declined. Opium.-Until the Inst few days the market -was verr active and considerable transactions had effect, but intelligence received s-id Calcutta, by electric telegraph, two days ago, of low-er prices for Malwa has caused the market to become quiet, and prices have declined. The steamer of tomorrow Vill have about 4,000 chests, and the Scindian, for Woosung direct, left yesterday with 1,400 chests. Feights have slightly given way. 31. 2s. to 31. 5s. to London and Liverpool per ton ; seeds, 3!. 10s. to 37. 12s. Gd. Exchange on England during the fortnight advanced considerably, and the business done we quote as follows 2s. 2d. to 2s. 2id. for Chima andfiestclass credits, and 2s. 2id. to 2is. 2gd. for documents; on Calcutta, 102r. at sight and 99Alr. at GO days' sig,ht; on Madras, 100 Ar. at sight and 99r.L atB30 days' sight; and on China, 215r. 3t 00 days' sight. - CALCUTTA MARKETS. CALCUTTA, DEC. 22. Since the issue of our last fortnightly report -we have had advices from London to the 9th ult., rid Bombay, the mail steamer from Suez having also been announced early yesterday morning. The prominent effect of the commercial accounts was an nmsediate excitement in our sugar niarket, which has since abated, and prices, which had advanced considerably, have again declined fully tvw-o rupees a-maund, although supplies from up the country havebeen quite scanty. In rice a brisk business is in progress at advanced prices. The demand for indigo is not very active, but public sales have resulted satisfactorily as regards fine qualities. In seeds, owing to very small stocks, a limited business has been done at full prices. We regret to have to report less favourably of the state of onur import niarket, which seems to suffer most from the increasing scarcity of money. The native dealers findin- it dificult to obtain accommodation for their legitimate opertionis have been conspelled to withdraw for ' time, and the sales that have been effected during the past wreek or two consist chiefly of what was imme. dlately required to complete previous arrangements. The advices from the upper provinces, moreover, are less satisfactory, owxing, it is said, to the want of adequate funds, and this circumstance, combined with large supplies of British cotton goods imported here lately, has removed all activity, although we cannot notice any material alteration in prices of these goods. Our money-market is again tighter, nor is there any appearance of relief for soene time to come. The banks, as -well as private capittalists in the Bazaar, are enabled to obtain their own terms, which in many instances are very exorbitant, and to which necessity alone compels borrowers to submit. In consequence of this state of affairs Government securities have been gradually depreciating, until Company's Four per Cents, have sold at rs. 17.8, and Sicca Four per Cents. at rs. 13.8 per cent. The NewFives do not seem to be affected much. Freights.-The abundance of tonnage and the scarcity of supplies of some staple articles have caused a slight decline in the rates of freights to England. The engagements during the past fortnight have been on a moderate scale, and the existing rates to London are 51. for sugar; 41. lOs. to 4!. 12s. . saltpetre; 41.17s. 6d. rice; 5!. wheat; 41.17s. 6d. Inseed orrapeseed; 31. 10s. jute; and 57. 5s. to 5. 10s. indigo. To Liverpool about 5s. per ton lower than these rates. For Australia as high as 6!. has beenpaid for a small vesselto sail immediately. We have not heard of any transactions for the continent of late, with the exceptionof the chartering of a vessel at 51. 7s. 6d. for Hamburg. For China a counle of thousand bales of cotton have just been engaged at A3.i per bale. Tho rates to Bombay arerlv r, and no more thai 0r. per ton all round would be paid now. To Mauritius rice is being shipped in small quantities at Ir. 6a. to Ir. 7a. Indigo.-Very little has been done by private contract, thougoh at the public sales prices of fine and mniddling qusahties have been fully maintained.

At Malta the Resolute took in tow Her Majesty's screw steam storeship Urgent, Commander Charles G. Phillips, her engines being out of order. Two days after, when the tow-ropes were cast off, the IUrgent got up steam, and, although the Resolute fired guns, waited some time at sea, and remained tvfo days at Gibraltar, nothing more was heard of her, and it is concluded that she went back to Malta. The machinery of the Resolute is out of order, which has caused several detentions on the passage. Between Malta and Gibraltar she spoke the bark Arctic Hero, and off Cadi; the troopship Albion, No. 23, both homeward bound. At Malta the crew of the screw steamshipRoyal Albert, 1201, fag of Sir Edmund Lyons, were taLing out her grus preparatory to the commencement of her repairs, which wiU occupy some time.

A UTSIBALIA. :OUTHADPTON, J. SD. By the Royal mtil steamship Atrato, which arrived lIAt night -with tho West Indian, Mexican, anxd Pacific mails, we have received intolligence, sid Is,ao and P.anama, from Melbourne to the 2d of Nlovenmber, and Sydcney to the 27th of October. Rich veins of quartz had been discovered about 20 mr.iles from Geelong. Ar. assay by crushing and amalgamation gave at the rate of 8SOoz. to the ton. There was a great rush of miners to the spot. A mail was to be made up at Melbourne to be forwarded by the Shalimar, which would leave for Liverpool on the 9th of November. The traitsport-ship Windsor, with a detachnment of thle 40th Reginient, anchored in Hobson's Bay on the 27th of October,from Dublin. The Sydney correspondent of the Atsgus says that great preparations were making for the elections. E3everal fatlures had taken place in Sydney, which Itad created considerable want of confidence in 3monetary circles, and on the Joint-Stock Bank at run had been made, although to a sma31 extent. Other failures were expected, but it was supposed hLe crisis had passed. The Australian papers contain accounts of consil3erable rioting anid robbery, and are directing attention to the insecurity of life and property, in consequence of the ferocity of the outlaws, numbers of -whom existed throughout the country. The correspondent of the Sydney Her ald, writino from Auckland, stys that the General Assembly was not expected to be convened before April. It was then anticipated that there woould be considerable disputing relative to the seat of governmnent and th2 separation of Auckland from the list of the umited provinces. A severe shock of an earthquake was felt at Taratnaki on the 229d of October, by which several buildings were destroyed. The season in New Zealand had been unusually mild, and larger tracts of land were under cultivation than ever known- previously. In Melbourne the price of gold was 31. 15s. 3d. per ounce. The arrials of shipping had been numerous, inclhdinlg the George Henrick, with 3,358 bags of flour; the Wanta, -with 6,619 bags; and the Greyhotund, with 8,800 bags, all from Valparaiso. The Express, from Califormia, lad also arrived. Fine flour was quoted at 471. per ton; second, 451. ditto; Chih:an, 47!. ; Haxall and Gallego, 481. 4 dheat, los. per bushlel. In Sydney Port Phillip gold was quoted at 31. l&i. per ounce. Superior fine flour, 401. * ordinary seconds, 37 1. WhEeat, Ens. per bu.sheL. Anericaa flour, 90s. per barreL.
THE PACIFIC. SOUTHAMPTON, J.&N. 30. By thelloyal M.iI Company's steamship Atrato we re, ccive our usual intelligence from tho Pacific ports. The British steamer Eolivia arrived at Panama on thc 5th inst. with 21 passengers, S22S0,000 in specie, and dates from Valparaiso, December 15; Lima, 27-; Gnayaquil, 30. From VaF3paraiso we learn that the Chilian Congress had an extra session. During the business 300,00D were voted for the erection of a pier for landing goods at Val p.raiso. The pier is to be of iron, and is to be capable of receiving three vessels of large draught alongside at one time. A supplementary addition of $30,000 has also been nade to the current appropriation of the year for roads and br-dges. The Agricultural NormalSchool hada-lso received a gr.at of $6,000 for seeds and utensiL-. The civil code has been approved, and vill come into operation on the Ist of Januiary, 1357. Don Andres BeUo, the author of the civil codc, ha- receivedl a vote of thanks from Congress, together with a p-esent of $20,000, as a proof of their appreciation of his Labours. A charter has been further granted, to a compary proposing to constract a railway, the cars to be drawn by animals, between the port of Coquimbo, the city of Serena, aud the Cuesta of Peralta. No charter bad yet been granted for the projected railway from Talchuano to Concepcion. Very violent weather had prevailed on the coast, and some vessels were seen in the distance with signals of distre%ss hoisted. In consequence of no assistance being rendered them the bark Caroline and brig Maanuel Olivaes, both Chilian vessels, vere driven on shore, where, after a fewv hours, they were entirely broken to pieces. The rain was exces.ive, but the effect it had on the grain crops was not known. In Peru and Bolivia matters were peaceable, but t7zere was every probability of a revolution in the former republic. The constitution had not yet been confirmed by the Peruvian Convention. General Santa Anna has obtained his permission to remain in Europe with the half -pay belonging to him as Major-General of the Republic. The Government has named depositors to cmbark the Peruian bark. Tlhe contract was to begin from the 15th of December, and an advance of $220,000 would be miade. The stock- was about 20,000 quintals. The yellow fever had made an invasion into Bolivia, and had also broken out in the province of Munecas, near La Paz. The President of Bolivia, General Cordova, was at Potosi. The sentence of death passed bycourt-martial on a political affender named fontalvo had been commuted. A question had arisen between the Governments of Bolivia and the Argentine Republic relative to the invasion of the town of Tav-i, rear Jujuy, by some Bolivian troops, who carried off o07er aI hundred head of cattle. In Pern a serious quarrel had occurred between the Executive and the Assembly, owing to the former disputing Certain acts of the latter relative to General Castillo. The Assembly was sustained, and the Executive, being defeated, was obliged to give satisfaction. At the sailing of the steamer friendly relations had been re-established between the two Powers. Several articles in the Heraldo had been denounced by Government, and Senor Lavianga, the editor, was obliged to conceal himself in one of the diplomatic agencies. The death of Dr. Tirado, ex-Minister to the United States, was announced.
2'O THE EDITOR OF THE TIAEZS'. Sir,-I notice with regret the unjust remarks of your correspondent in this day's paper, under the head of the " Belgian steam line to New I ork." The survey not having yet been made, beyond slowing the necessity of unloading the cargo of the 3elgique, which the dock company has thLs day commenced, surely it would be more reasonable in your informant to have Awaited the result of the survey before he formed such an unfavourable opinion of her state. Those who know the town are well aware that your correspondent i- greatly interested in the line to New York, but it cannot justify his thus writing of the Belgique. Your correspondent will, doubtless, inform you of what p"s bef~ore the magistratea; hut I have every reason to believe froms inquiries in the proper quarter, that the comrplaints sre without just cause, as, until it can be ascertained what is the ral amount of damage sulstained, the owners cannot be called upon to provide other accomunodation for their asengers. -' < --- - .E liiVRRK Zeig;= JOnSuate, ;5oUthampton, Jm. 29.

IRELAND. DP4. Cul1X ON CRIME 12N ENGLAND. I (XOx OUR ow.N CORRESPDEN.) D}UBL2l. WXDNESDAY lAfl'1W- A monster pastoral from the prolific pen of Archbishop Cullen was read at all the chapels in the diocess of Dublin on Sunday last, by way of preparation for the approaching festival of the Pu'rification of the Virgin. The topics introduced were for the most part the old and worn ones-31ariolatry, pro. selytisnm, and a sweeping denunciation of tracts and tract distributors, or wolves in shleep's clothing. Having exhausted these fertile themes, the Apostolic Delogate proceeds to draw a contrast betweenx the state of morals in England and Ireland, ex. gr.*- " Is it desirable that our poor and destitute population should be reduced to that state of religrious wetnivhich prevails among the orng classes o n? esu pose that this is the object of the bible ae d othor societes of the sister kingdom in sending their emissaries to our coasts, and that it is with this view they expend such enormous sums in their attempts to proselytize our people, for it is scarcely to bo imagined that they wish to make us better than theinselves. Now, let us ask, what is the con. dition of the mass of the peoplo in En"land? WVhile the judges are expressing their delight at the lightness of the calendar, aid tho absence of crime in the largest and most Catholic counties of Ireland, though poverty aid misery still prevail in them to a considerable extent, Ingland presents a very difcerent picture. Need we speak of the suicides, the child munierings, the poisonings, the burglaries, the sale of 'wives, the degrading immnoralities, the innumerable murders that are recorded from week to week in the columns of the public press, and which cannot be read without horror and dismay? But, drawing a veil oser these awful atrocities, wlhich reveal astate of thinga equalled only by the degradation of Pagan morality at the time of the Apostle of the Gentiles, let us take a description of the religious condition of the masses of England trom a more authoritative source, and from a document which must have described thingswith accuracy and truth. Such we consIer to be the report of the tlhurch Pastoral Aid Society for the Fast year (May! 1855), a society whose committee consists, according to th~eir ow-n reisort, of one archbishop, 19 Protestant bishops, and several diitinguiished noblemen, |of w.hom Lord Shafteahury, the most celebrated chanspion of Protestantinsm, is the head. NTow 'what do we read in this report7 At page 18 we find the following extract from a late charge of the Bishop of Winchester, adoptd by the co.innittee as containing an accurate account o thectual state of things:- - I You know that, in a Christian land, dwelling within the sound of the church-going bell, amiid neighbours who recognize that the earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof, with daily sights before their eyes to remind them that the fishion of this 'world passeth away and the flower thereof fadeth, there is yet a mass of unenlightened, unreclaimed, unregenerated heathenism, professed uibelievers, or practical unbelievers, without God in the 'world, as ignorant of His grace and gospel, and as recldess of death and judgment, as if no revelation had been given from Heaven,' &c. "In the same page the respected Prelate's authority is ginO quoted as follows zT I hese are the home heathen, who keep aloof altogether from the public ministrations-who never enter a church, never kneel in common prayer, never come witliin the sound of a sermon, never participate in the sacraments of grace.' i' Thus, according to a learned Protestant bishop, after enjoying the benefit5 of the Reformation for thre centuries, there is a mass of unenhightened, unreclaimed, unregenerated heathenism at the very doors of the Protestant churches in England. Who would wish to see Ireland reduced to so sad and degraded a st.ate? " Having drawn largely from this and other similar sources of information, the pastoral proceeds in this strain - .,It is a great grace and blessing to belong to that church 'which inherits its power from Christ, and is endowed with ar.thority to crush error and to suppress immorality, as 'well as to spread the doctrines of trath and to uphold the practice of every virtue. What a calamity to be separated from this church I See the condition of the unhappy Greek, once so famous for sanctity and learning. Scarcely had they raised the standard of rebellion against the Apostolic See than Constantinople fell into the hands of their barbarous enemies, and they becanie slaves in their own homes. What sball we say of England? Shc, too, rejected the benign sway of Rome. Vhat is the consequence? We have laid before you the condition of her niasses, as described by dignitaries of the establishment. Her church, at once the creature and the mere slave of the State, separated from the mystic vine, has no vitality i her, and is incapable of producing fruits of salvation. AU her acts are the acts of mere temporal authority, derived not fromi the founder of the Christian religion, hut from Parliamentary legoislation." mm lRSH CON'VuNON. The annual farcical gathering of the Tenant League was held yesterday at their council-rooms, in ]3achelor's-walk, to tak-e means for the introduction of the League Bill into Parliament at the opening of the cominug session, and to consider the present umdoubtedly rickety position of the tenant cause in the hands of its acting managers. According to the Eveing Post, this imposing demonstration of the national wil was composed of seven menibers of Parliament, witli about 30 other gentlemen, lay and clerical. Mr. Edward MArEvoy, the new representative for Meath, was the chlairnman. Here is the substance of the day's deliberations:- " A len"thy report was read, settin; forth the opinions of the councA on the present state and suture prospects of the tenant question, and, after the report was unanimously adopted, a resolution, moved by Mfr. J. 3'Nansara Cant- tell, seconded by the Rev. Mr. Quaid, parish priest, to the effc.t that the Tenant Right Bill in the House of Commons should be intrusted to Mlr. George H. Moore, MP.. and BIr. John laguire, M.P., wyas also agtreed to. Those gentlenmen, in returning thanks for the 'onour conferred upon them, expressed opinions to the effect that there were ist slender hopes of the question making pbrogress during the approaching session, and that it should he at the nexst general election the hattle should be fought." OOVRR*c7i1yT PAThOsvAGE. The death of MVr. Theobald l].renna, which took place yesterday at the Shelbourne Hiotel in thirs city, leaves vacant the lucrative office of First Clerk of the Chief Secretary and Deputy keeper of the Privy Seal. The appointment is a per,nanent one, and the holder is not subject to removal by any MIinisterial changes. The salary is, it isbelieved, about 1,5001. per annumn. The deceased, wfho had been for some time in declinine' health, had filled the office for a period only of~ seven or eight years. The sentiments embodied in a recent article in le Times, with regard to the improved aspect of what was once alleged to be the g,reat difficulty of the ablest statesman of the day, have been responded to in a most cordial spirit by an old and respectable Roman CathoEic org,an, the Cork- Southernl Reporter. Sonme six or seven years sinCe this journal w as preeminently distingu,is3hed. not only asan advocate of national independence, but as one of the champions of physical force for the attainment and possession of that fool's paradise. Having, in conjunction with the Vast buLk of its co-ag,itators, awakened, asit were, from a troubled dream, the lethargy is shak en off, and the jourrnalist thus makes the amtesde for all past illusions *- "-The truth is, our qunrxrwith EnIgland, as a nation, is artan end, if she willhave it so. The past is past. We act in the living present. We might takre up the bitter story of our country, anDa read in it of the wrong8s done our fathers by the fathers of those who dwell to-dymi Englishi homes. We could extract from its perusal enough of rancour and of hate to poison oulr minds against all who bear the English name. But we are ready and anxious to live for a wiser and nobler purpose. We are ready and anxsious to do aught 'which men can hononrably do to preven,t the revival of those accursed feuds that distracted and ruined our forefathers, and made our beauteous islnd a plague spot on the face of the earth. It isno part ofonr Irish nature to carry an undyin'S animosity in our bosoms against those who are wlling to l.ive on terms of peace and harmonyy'w ith s One fair concession blots from an Irshmauls memory the remembrance of SOinjuries. Evrery act of Imperial justice, during 25 years past, has been the means0f effacing a hundred deeds of national wrong from oar recollection. But, while the island, from one extremity to the other, bore a population whose appalling miseries were the fearful legacy of past oppression, it was impossiblo that its people could harmonize with the race the crimes of 'whose ancestors had led to so terrible a -result. The famine of 1&47 sw-ept away the element of implacable, irreconcileable hate to EingLand, wthich, while it existed, must, have made union or allhance with her, save that o£ iron restraint, impossible.

LAW REPORT. COURT OF CBANCERY. ILCvo<RV-.m XTAN -in NM}*ELTLEY V. BARTOW-IN RV PAT .T;. (Before thc LORDS JUSTICES of APPRAL.1 IMr. CAIi2;S was heard at great length on behalf of Mr. Collins, that he might be restored to the roll of solicitors of this court, he having been, in obedience to an order of I August, 1855, removed but no proceeding having been yet taken to remove him from the rolls of the common law courts. Tho facts have been -oro than once very fully 'reported in 2'he Timaj, and need not be hero repeated, further than that the chief grounid on wlhich the judgment of the Lords Justizes roceeded was, that counsel had been instructed by Mr. Coluns to consent to a petition on behalf of a party who had not given authority, the effect of the order made upon timo petition being that a fund was paid out of court by which the plaintiff in the suit had sustained loss. The learned counsel said that, among other things, it was made quite manifest by the new afodavits that Mr. and Mmre Wheatley did, Or mnuatmost irresistibly be assumned to know of the application to the Court upon petition, and that, so ear, as was hereteforo believed, from Mr. Collins havingbeen benefittedonoshilling by thbetransaction, he had been out of pocket more than 6OO ; and, also, contrary to the former impression, the money ibad not in any way been misappropriated by him - that the parties knew of the intended application tothe aourt, andthat it was assented to by them, were plainly to bo inferred from the fact that Mrs Bastow, the mother, wrote a letter, as agent of Mlr. Collins, to herdaughter, Mrs. Wheatley, aboutsix wee'ksaftertheoran action, speaking of getting the money out of court and referring to an account appended, and which lotter could not have been written had there not been some former communication or correspondence on the subject, and sucha letter it would have bees utter insanity to have permitted to be written if Mr. Collins had not believed he had the authority of} r. Wheatley for what he had done. Theloarned counsel concluded by suggesting to the Court that, although it was not pretended to justify the very irregular conduct of which hlr. Collins had been guilty, yet, considering that ho had been severely punished by removal from the roll, had suffered very great damage in his business, and had not gained a singlc shillmng by tho irregularity, he had showvn such a case as to induce the Court to exercise its merciful Jurisdiction and restoro him, as had been done in several inustances to which the learned COlUnsel referred. Mr. Goldsmid appeared for MIr. Wheatley, Mr. Speed was counsel for M1r. Bastow, and Mr. Taylor attended on behalf of Mr. Johnson, the solicitor to the suitor's fund. At the conclusion of Mr. Cairnss argument their LOtDsars desired copies of the papers to be'handed up, intimatimg that on a future day, of which they would give timely notice, they would determine whether counsel for the other parties should be called up before the decision of the Court should be pronounced.
VICE-CHSCEL=ORS' COUIRTS. .TAX. . HARRTSON V. GUR-sT. (Before V-GAanrplm R-. T RKivn1 .v -A This caso was argued on tho 10th and 12th of December last, when his Honour reserved his judgment. The bill sought to set aside a sale of certain property mado to the defendant npon alleged circumstances of advautage taken of a person named Hunt, wYho was in hnunble life, and living at Broadwas, in WVorcestershire, by the defendant, who stated hhuself as a man of influence and station in the parish. The easo made by the bill vas, that in the summer of 1853, Hnnt, being in bed from sores in his legs, the defendant called on him, and after sevoral interviews, and without any professional assistance, certain copyhold property of Hunt was conveyed to Guest in consideration of paling off a mortgage upon it, and allowing him to reside at a house of the defendant, to be supplied from his own table, and 12s. a-week during the remainder of his life. There was also an allegation that the defendant had endeavoured to get possession of the title-deeds from certain mortgagees upon the property, but without effect, and that in September the mortgage was paid off, and the deeds handed over, and on the Gth of October the conveyance of the property was executed by Hunt in the presence of Guest's solicitor, who stated in his evidence t iat he explaiaed the deed to Hunt, and told him that if ho did not comprehend it he ought to have an attorney; but lie stated that he understood it, and wished to dispose of his property to secure hiu the comforts of life, havinig no relations that he cared for, and then executed tho deed, Guest being then called into the room. On theo 12th of November Hunt died, and this bill was filed by his personal representatives to set aside the whole transaction on the ground of advantage taken of Hunt's position and state of health, of tho transaction having taken place vithout professional assistance, of haste, and, in short, of such a state of circumstances as rendered the transaction invalid. It appeared that in July the same year Hunt had entered into the same sort of negotiation with a person named Evans at Worcester, which, however, went off. lr. Swanston and 1r. Shapter appeared for tho plaintiff; Mr. Baily, Mr. Glasse, and Mr. Elderton for the defendant. he VTICE-CASNcELLoR now recapitulated the circumstances in detail, and observed that the case resting (as to the negotiation) chiey on the evidence of the defendant rendered the matter very unsatisf.actory, and nothing could be imagined more imprudent and improner than aLlowving such a transaction to take place, and it wast temore surprising thatthe defeudant'ssolicitor shouldnothaveinsisted upon anothersolicitorbeingemployed. The evidence showed vgour of mind, although there was illness of body, and thereforethere was capacity su'fficient to carry out such a transaction as that now impeached. It appears that the deed was prepared from the sole instructions of Guest, no draught having been sent to Hunt before it was executed, and no person having been present during the negotiations. Withoutsayingthatitought to be set aside on any of these grounds, the onus lay upon 31r. Guest to show that it was perfectly fair; and if he could not do that the transaction ought not to stand. His Honour then referred to the deed, and said that the right to occupy the apartnient in the defendant's house first struck the mind as a stipulation, not in the deed, but that would .at once fail with Guest's life; and there was also an inducement held out that Guest would supply him from his own table, which vas also notcontained in the deed. There also appred a money consideration of 10?., paid by Guest to lunt, which never appeared to have been agreed to by Hunt or offered by Guest, and Hunt signed the deed acknowledging the receipt, and this was said to be inserted to meet legal expenses, but no such thing appeared to have been known to Hunt. The covenant to pay the allowance was at the option of Guest, and had ho died 12s. a-week was all Hunt would have got. It appeared to his Honour that the deed did not carry out the inducements Hunt had to execute it, and, on the whole, it could not stand, being inadequate in consideration, and of such a nature that Hunt niust havo been a lawyer to understand it. Itwasnot on any one circtunstance, but upon all the circunistances tho deed must be set aside, so far as it purported to bo ais absolute conveyance. WVithout imputing to the defendant any design to get possession of this poor man's property, but still characterizing itas amostimprudent and' improper transaction, anaccount must be taken in chambers, and what had been paid by the defendant must be allowed, with costs to be paid by Mr. Guest up to the bearing. (Before Vce-Chausenlor Sir W. P. WoOD.) DACRE V. SMACIVHN. MTr. SEiV-y resumed the reading of the evidence, and was then heard on behalf of the plaintiff in this case. The enormous length to which the evidence and correspondence extend makes it impossible to give more than a short outline of the facts. We have already stated that the charges made against tho defendant relate to his mana-ement of certain estates belonging to the plaintif, his ward, during his minority, extending over a period of more than 17 years, and the principal relief sought by the plaintiff's bill is to set asido a release which he bad executed to Mr. Strachan on his attaining his majority in 1846, to obtain an account of all receipts and disbursements during thoe uardianship, and in that account to debit Mr. Strachan with a sum of upwards, of 5,0001., being the excess of his expenditure over his receipts, and to raise which a mortgage had been created on the plaintiff's estate. The plaintiff is the son of Mr. Joseph Dacre, who, at the time of his death in 1828, was entitled, under a settlemont made in 1784, as tenant in tail male in remainder expectant on the death of his mother, to an estate in Cumberland, called the Kirklinton estate, comprising between 700 and S)O acres; and was also entitled under the wi of his father (the plaintiff's grandfather) to certain other farms, kmown as Allergath and LeapsngM, for his life, with remainder in tail general to the plawntiff. These farms comprised about 1,090 acres. In 1828 Mr. Joseph Dacre died, having made hiswill and appointed the defendant, Mr. James Morgan Strachan, of Tedingtos*Mr Henry Mortocr, Mr. George Jenkins Waters, and the Rev. Bobert Jennings, guardians of his two only children, Joseph and Wlilliam, of whom Joseph (the plaintiff) was the elder, being at the time of his father's death two and a-half years old. The testator also aointed as his executors, the Hon. Henry Greme, . George Casamajor, and the said. Messrs. Waters and Jennings (all of whom were then in India), and also the said Mfr. Mortlock, 3M Daere, the plaintiff's grandmother, and the defendant. The will was proved in Indiabysome of-the executors there, and in EngandgbyMr.Strachan alone, who also took upon himself the guardianship of the children and the management of the esatee. The plaintiffhbecam an inmate in the house of Mr and t Strachan, and so continued, with the exception of such times as he was at school or college, until the year 1848. In 1841 he bad been sent to Rugeby, where he remained till 1844, when he went UDpto Trinity College, Cam. bridge, and took his degree in 18dan It was durig his residerice at the lUnivorsity that be attained his majority and executed the release in question, and also tho indenture of. mortae, charging his estates wi the sn representingenamount ofrthe dbt incurred by Mr. Strachan in the alloged imProVemont of the property After taking his degree the plaintife seems to have taken to fanning on a. sml scale in- Cumberlaud, which he continued tibl8L-S, when he roqird and obtained from Mr. Hanson, t~he solicitor of the defendant, various documents and papers relating to the management of the estates during his minority. The result was an application by his solictors to toh defendant for an investigation of the receipts and. pavmeats, and, after some correspondence, this was declined, ai ftendant relying npon the release as a full and effectual closing of theoaccounts8and discharge to him. The plaintiff thereupon filed his bill, which containLs various charges-relating to the execution of the release, and, amongotheri, the wanut of professional advice adssd23istaiice incorrect recitals in the deed. itself, the withholding by the -defendant of' information and explanation axs to his posMtion, the non-production of vouchers to bear out the acconmtS, and that he was eatirelyimder the influence of the-defendant. No direct charge of coercion was madein tho bill; but this also was put forwarcd by the plaintiff-in-his evid.nce in the Etrongest possible form With respect to the misnagemet,theplaintiff charged the defendant with havingindulged in fanciful and speculative improvements on the estate, wuch as planting, draiig, road-maling, fencing, pulling down buildings, &c. One ground of com- laint was that the latitationa hid been formed in curved lines for the sake o oruxse' and: ab a great increase of thiatthe in toan extent of 35 acres; that tho feneinighad-extendedtol16miles, and thatailtbihad2<reiiltediutbeeuormous excessof expenditure over thereceipi5. These receiptsaduring the 17yeara bad been 17,0001., while the expenditure had been 22,000?. The plaintfffffurtherchared the defendant with having exoeedel his povrers by granting leases extending beyond his mino- ity, a circumstance which (as he alleged) was not made known to him on his execution of the release. It is quits .mpossiblc to enter further into the question of manage. mrrent, resting, as it does, entirely on letters, reports of surveyors and land agents, and eidence of various fitnesses, thereading of which, onbehalf of the plaintiff al one, hais already occupied sO much time. The contention for the plaintiff is that the defend3nt, in his character of guardian, w as a mere bailiff of the estate, and that ats such the cxp~enditure which had been incurred wras quite unjustifia le;t,hat if the plaintiff had died, or if he had conveyed away his estate on attaining his majority, the defendant could not have recovered any part of the debt which had been incurred aginst the plaintiff's estate; that the release therefore amounted to a mere gift or bounty which could not be supported, on authority, as between guardian and ward; that if the bill had been filed by the plaintiff immediately on his attaining his majority, no defence of the expenditure could have been grounded on any communications which might have passed with the plaintiff during minority, and that no such defence could therefore be raised now * that the release itself wouldbe scannedi with great jealonsy by the Courtas rs'arded its constructien, and thatthodelay chargedainst the plaintiff in not sooner seeking to set it aside could not, under the circumstances, be sufficient to deprive the plaintiff of relief. At the conclusion of the plaintiffs case, Tho VICX-CHACEnLLoR said that, before calling on Sir Frederick Thesiger, he felt bound, in justico to tho gentleman who was the defendant in this case, to make some few observations as to the charge of coercion which had been brought forward by the plaintiff, and thus releve the counsel for the defenco from a considerable portion of this very painful case. The Court had nothing to do with motives, and could only look at the evidence before it. The plaintiff had thought fit to place his case upon the' coercion exercised by the defendant, and on his harsh imperious temper, which was stated to be such as to deprive him of froe agency and to make him feel, as hesaid in his evidence, that he was alwaysentirely inthe hands of the defendant. Not con. tent with this, ho had produced another ward of Mr. Strachn to depose to tyrannical conduct on the part of that gentleman to such an extent as to reduce alU the nutural and moral powers to a state of absolute subserviency. It turned out that this ward had owred his education solely to the bounty oi MIr. Strachan, his godfather, and it was to be observed that certainly Mir. Strachan seemed to have been most unfortunate in his wards. Happily, however, for the defendant, so far as this testimony was concerned, tho correspondenco which had passed between himself and the plaintiffhadbeenpreserved, andthat wasutterlyatvariance owith this testimony. Thishadbeen felt by MIr. Rolt inhis opening,andhehadsocordinglyshiftedhisgroundinthecourso of his argument from this sort of coercion to that occasioned by "the tender influences of home ties," and argued that the plaintiff had been tied down by feelings of gratitude to the course prescribed by the defendant. It had been suggested by Mlr. Selwyn that the plaintiff had been so cowed and coerced by the long system of severity that the painful result had been a deep hypocrisy on tho part of the plaintiff, lasting from 17 to 25 or 26, and that this explanation was to be received as some reason for the execution of the release. The letters, however, of the plaintiff were as free and unbiassed as it vas possible to conceive in a boy of 16 or 17, and he might state that they showed thought and intelligence and an affectionate disposition quite unusual in a person of that age. They were utterly inconsistent with the suggestion that all his moral faculties had been subdued and coerced. It was undoubtedly true that harsh treatment was most injadicious, bult it appeared that, on the contry, MIr. and Mrs. Strachan had acted as kind and affectionate parents, and this was best evidenced by the lettes themselves, containing, as they did, a most unreserved disclosur of the subjects in wlich the boy felt interest. His Honour then referred to letters of the plaintiff, written from Rugby in 1842, and among othors to one mentioning the death of Dr. Arnold, and which (his Honour observed) contained thoughts and reflections very unusnal in a boy of 17,jtestifyilig as many events had done, to the extraordmnary power of that great teacher in opening the mind and securing the affections of his pupils. Such letters, which were written in a simple strain of affectionate intersourse, were utterly inceonsistent wmith the awre and terror with which Mr. Strachan was invested. The only instance of coercion by the defendant appearp d to be that he had requested the plaintiff, while at Rugby, to biurn Lord Cltc?rferdsCidclers, which ho had recentiy purchased, and which the plaintiff accordingly did. But, remembering the way in whlich Dr. Johnson had characterized that Nvork, such1 advice wv-as not, perhaps, surprising. In a further letter, written at the beginning ofthe hoilydays, the plaintiff regretted being kept at school to play a criclket match, talfied of home and counting the hours tiUl he arrived. Was he to believe aU this to be gross hypocrisy, or the simple outpourings of the heart from a boy who had a happy home? Then, agam, in 1845-and he might observe that, unquestionably, pnnciples of obedience were of the utmost importanco, and could not be too early inculcated, though not on the other hand to be strained-at this period Mr. Strachan made a request to the plaintiff as to making some visit, and, rightly or wron_ly, thougt that this simple request ought to be complied with, and that thi refusal showed a want of affection. The plaintiff wrote a very long letter, asserting in the strongest manner his independence, but four months afterwards, on his returu to Cambridge, he had written a most affectionate letter, in which he acknowledged himself to be utterly wrong. Mr. Bolt had suggested that the chango was dictated by tio want of nioney mentioned in the postscript. No instanco, however, was to be found of Mr. Strachan having allowed the plaintiff to be in want! of money; and lie believed that the letter was written inrenuously. It did the highest credit to the feelings of tie plaintiff, and the highest credit to the training pursued by the defendant; otherwise the plaintiff must stand convicted of the grossest hypocrisy. Mr. Strachan had not assumed, but had rather undertaken, this most painfil, and too generaUy thankless duty of taking the care of the children of a deceased friend, and he had performed the duty of a most kind and judicious parent towards them in their bringin" up. He had placed them under a master and at a school which had developed to the highest degree their moral and inteUectual faculties. They lhbeen subsequently removed to Cambridge, where they obtained the full benefit of the highes education which any gentleman could reqtire. After alU this, it Was really extraordinary that coercion shouldhavebeen talk-ed o. He found no fault with the plaintiff for asserting his rights; but, if this suggestion of coercion were meant as an apology for the execution of the release, it had singularly failed; its introduction was greatlytobe regretted. The intercourse down to 1851 appsred to have been most friendly, when it wNas painfully chan"ed, in a most abrupt manner, by the letter to Mr. Strachan of the 5th of May, 1851, commencing " Mr. Dacre presents his compliments," &c. His Honour concluded by s&aying that he would entirely liberate Sir F. Thesiger from addressing himself to the question of coercion and influence. Sir F. TusEsboEn then commenced his opening for the defendant, but had not nearly concluded at the rising of the Court. The case wi be resumed on the first cause day in the

WILDE, kj.V., mnoved for a rle calling upon Henry Frederick Hodgson, a person residing at Cradleyheath, in the county of Stafford, to show cause why a criminal information should not be filed against him for the forgery of a diploma of membership of the Royal Colleg of Surgeons. It appeared from the statement made by the learned counsel that Hodgson had been ass-istant to a surgeon named Higgs, in the same place, and on his death he gave it out that he was going to practise as a surgeon on his own aceount. In order to satisfy the public tilat he was duly qualified to practise as a surgeon, fe invited several persons into his house to inspect his diploma, which was hanging up in his sitting-room, framed and glazod. The name of "1odgson" appeared to have been written over au erasure; and, upon further examination, it turned out that tho year 1850 had been altered to 1855, and that one of the examiners who had signed the diploma was an examiner in the year 1850, hut was not so in the year 1855. It also appeared on the affidavit of the secretary of the Royal College of Surgeons that the number of the diploma was 25,921, and that no diploma -with so high a number had been ever given. Tho num.ber of Mr. Rigggs?s diploma was 2,592. There ws no doubt, from theso facts, that the diploma exhibited was iggrss diplomas altered so as to suit Hoagson's purpose. It was also stated that Hodgson, by represnting tht he was duly qualified to practise as a surgeon, had got himself appointed vaccinator b the board of guardians, but his appointment had since, b resinded on the discovery that he was not duly qualified. Upon this statement of facts it vas clear that Mr. Hodgson h-ad been guilty of haning up in his rooa, and putting forth to the world, as a dip oma of the Colege of Surgeons, a document which had never been granted to him asa diloma.

C.&RLO V. IRY;L£ND. In this cse a rule had been grnted caDing uwn the defendant to show cause why the verdict which ha en gven in his favour should not besetaside, andanewtrialgranted, upon the grounds stated in an affdavit. At the trial the question was whether the defendant, who kept a tavern in tetter-Lane, had taken a certain checkl bon fide, and had given. alue for it. The check in question had been stolen by a nan named Bridmore, who had formerly been a clerk in the plaintiff's office, and had been cashed bythedefendant. At the trial, which took place some timue since before Lord Campbell, the defendant obtained a verdict; but subsequently a rule for a new trial was granted on an affidavit which went to show thattheevidence given bythe defendant at tho trial was untrue. The afidavit wasmade bythe man Bridmore, who had stolen the check. He stated that he had been in the habit of playin at cards for money with tho defendant at his house, and that the check in question was cashed by the defendant, and the money so obtained lost to the defendant at play. Mr. PETERsDoRFF now showed cause against the rule, and read affidavits made by the defendant and his wife, in which they gave a distinct denial to Bridmore's allegations. The defendant also stated that he had ascertained that Bridmore, on whose single anfidavit the rule depended, had been convicted of perjury at the Old Bailey. Bridmore had also written to the defendant for pecumary assistance, wbiich was refused, and it was suggested that it was in consequence of that refusal he had now tendered his evidence to the plaintiff to set aside the verdict. MIr. J UIEs (with whom was Mr. Hance) rose to: support the rule, bat was stopped by Lord CAsn'PELL, w.ho said, ho thought it was not fair to the defendant that he -should run any risk from one so infasnous as Bridsnore appeared to be. Till that letter came out which had 3ust been read, his (Lord Campbell's) mind was that a jury ought to determuie the matter, but it now seemed that lie (Bridinore) went first to one side md then to the other. WVithout that letter the rule ought to have been made absolute, but with it the rule must be discharged. The other Judges concurred.-IPnle discharmed. BAIL COURT, - (Sitting in Banco before MAfr. Justice Erx..) ENX PARTE - V. ATTORNEYS. Mr. HIUDDLEsTo.N moved for a rule, calling upon two gentlemen, attorneys of this court, whose names he would not mention, to show cause why they should not pay over to the applicant one-fifth share of a sum of money which had been received bythem ofthe Treasury on an intestate's estate, .and whythoyshould not answver the matter in the affidavits. The facts were these :-in the year 1846, a gentleman who was a clergyman and vicar in the south of England, died intestate, and had then no next of kin. In the course of the year 1848 an advertisement from the Treasury appeared in the different local and metropolitau papers, announcing the death of this gentleman and requiring the next of kin to a pply, and stating that the property was considered to be of the value of 100,000. The gentleman on whose behalf he made the application had devoted his time to the study of genealogy, and, having time and leisure to follow up the pursuit of the next of kin, he undertook to search for him, and he seemed to have acted with the most extraordinary perseverance, industry, and ingenuity in the pursuit of this inquiry. He made searches in differesnt genealogical works, he repaired to different parish churches, he entered into correspondence with different clergymen who were likely to have recourso to different registers. Hfe made searches in the different prerogative courts, and expended time and money and industry, and put advertisements in different newspapers, and he discovered, someahere towards the end othehe year 1S52, a gentleman tarreing on business in the north of England, who ho was satisfied w;as the next of kin, as connected with a gentleman who had marred twice-farst inl746, and again in 1773. There was no doubt in the mind of the gentleman for whom the learned counsel applied, that the person in the noith who marred an 1746 and in 1773 was the same person, and the claim of the gentleman in the north was ultimately substantiated. In the course of advertising the applicant was brought into connexion with a French gentleman, and, afterfrequentnmeetings, they agreed to act together and proceed in the investigation for the purpose of establshing the title of the next of kin. They then informed the gentleman who by them was considered to be the next of kin of his good fortme, and theyrecommended'him to consult his friendsas to what sumthey ought to give themforthe information they possessed, and they suggested that an agreement should be drawn up between them. I consequence of this, one of the two gentlemen against whom he applied was retained by the next of kin, and he had shown to him a box containing the documents which they had obtained. It was then arranged that, if any sum of money should be recovered, the applicant and the French gentleman should each receive one-fifth of the amount actually recovered, Land the attorney himself drew up an agreement between the parties to that effect, and that agement was signed on the 4th of December, 1852, andit was agreed that the parties should not makeknowntoothersthe information they obtained from the applicant. The attorney then requiested the applcant to make out from his papers and researches a history of the case for the Treasury. All this was done, and the matter came before Vice-Chancellor Stuart's clerk for the purposeof showing whether the pedigree could be made out. During the investigation the Vice-Chancellor's clerk was adverse to the claim, as he was not satislied with the identity of the person who was married in 1746 with the person who was married in 1773, but the matter was proceeded with, and ultimately they succeeded in obtaining the money, which amounted to 52,0001. But it would a that the attomeys had previously intimated to theo next of kin that his claim was not any good, and that they were, in addition, preparing to get nd of the agreement with the applicant, for they requested the applicant to come down to the north to see some witnesses, and they sent 5!. for his expenses, and he went upon his journey. It appeared that the applicant had been engaged in a Chancery suit which had turned out against him, and an attachment was out for the costs, so that the applicant was very anxious that his movements should not be known, and no person knew of his miovements but these attomeys. It was arranged that the attorney's clerk and certain witnesses should meet the applicant at a certain tspot on a certain day. The applicant went there, but, instead of meeting the attorney's clerk andthe witnesses, he was met by an officer, who took him into custody on the attachment. In a short time he was visitedby one of these attorneys, who made an arrangement that he should remain in the town during that day, and should not be removed to the county gaol anntil the following day. The attorney then told the aplicant that it would be impossible for him to settle with his creditor, andthat he had better take the benefit of the Insol. vent Court, and stated to him that the next of kin had determined not to proceed with his case, and, therefore, the applicnt's interest in the agreement being at an end, and that, in point of law, he not being bcound to insert the agreement in his schedulee, and the agreement had, therefore,, etter be cAncelled; but ho (the attorneyj would take care that, should the case go on, the ap.i plicant should have his share for his servnces, and that the papers should not be used by them for any other purpose. Relying upon this assurance, the appheant consented to the agreement being cancelled. The applicant took the benefit of the act, and then the attorneys set him to work agair. The attorneys induced the father-in. law of one of Shem to advance the next of kin 1,500!., upon an agreement that he should have one-half of the money to be recovered. In consequence, however, of somet that took place a friend of the attorney was substituted for the father-in-law as. the advancer of the 1,500.. The attorneys then sought for a ground of quarreling with the applicant, and insulted him. The next of In, however distinctly told the applicant that, whatever arrAngement bad been entered into, his rights were preserved. On the 4th of March an advertisement appeared in the papers detailing all the facts which had been cosumunicated by the applicant, and desired to have the identity of the parties proved. On the foUowing day a letter came from the samo town, addressed to the town agents of these attorneys, and a person caUed and left an award which professed to have been made in 1798, and which referred to a deed settling some mnoney upon the children of the marriage of-1746.-This award was to supplythe only link wanting, and the schedule to it referred to deeds which were said to be in tho possession of a certain person. The facts as detailed in the award could only have been knowvn by a person cognizant of the papers wbLchhad been furnished by the applicant. A seach was made by the applicant for the deeds inentioned in ti. nd and he went to the offloe of the attrney in whosm posesekontheywere xaid to be, and, upon lookingat the -calbook-in their offiee,hke foundthe name of the peraosrwhc, had left the award, and naext in order was thenae of one of thelatt-eys aint whom this appcation was made. This award was Vfcr pren the Vice-Vhncelors clerk- u~pon the affidavit of one of thes gentlomen, ana hie stted ttnat he had received a letter from the man who had 'irought it, dated MSlta, and ating that he was gone to California.

Unless he could make out a fraud, or an undertakIg, ho did not see how he could interfere. M1r. HiUDDMETONSS thought the arrest and the takting the benefit of the act was the concoction of the attorneys.

Addison appeared to show cause against a rule for an injunction agaiust the defendants, enjoining them to afford equal facilities to the plaintiff for carrying on hs trade of a coal merchant that they afforded to other coalowners sending coals bytheir railway; and Mr. Bovill, Q.C., Mr. T. Jones, and a r. Anderson: appeared in support of the rule. The roe was obtained under the provisions of the Rail. way and Canal Traffic Regulation Act (the 17th and 18th of Victoria, chap. 31), which requires railway companies to afford aU reasonble facilities for the receiving, forLardin,g and delivering of traffic; that they shall not subject any particular description of traffic to any unduo or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage; and that they stil not give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to or in favour of any particular person or company. In case of any infringement of these provisions of the statute power is given to apply to the Court of Com. mon Pleas ror a wlrit of injunction to restrain suchrailway company from further continuing these practices, a dis. obedience of which subjects to heavy penalties and an attachment. In the present case the defendants, in showing cause, relied on affidavits, stating that they afforded the same facilities to the plaintiff as to all other persons under the lik- circumstances. The plaintiff onthe affidavits, con. tended, in support of the rule, that the defendants, at the termination of their lne, had reserved and let al their depOts and standage room to other large coalowners, so that he could not unload his wa;gons there, and had refused to carry his coal to their termmnus, wrhere it joins the Midland Railway, but had stopped it at York. The plaintiff also complainod that by the mode in which the d endants had dealt with him his trado was. toppeadruined. The Rail. way Traffic Act was passed for the very object of reventing these inequalities of dealing with the public. ahe defendanlts had also charged the plaintiff a higher rate of toll for the carriage of his coats than they had charged other great codlowners. On thesegronnds it sas s-ought to make the role The Counr took time to consider its judgment.

Mr. Baron ALDEP-SON also intimated that in this case, which was a rule for a new trial on the ground that the verdict for the plaintiff was against evidence, and on affidavits, the opinion of IMr. Biaron Martin and of himself was that the rulo ought to be discharged. The affidavits on which the defendant relied went to contradict the evidence of a man named Stagg, with which the learned judge who tried the case was certainly dissatisfied. Hiq testimony might, therefore, be discarded; but the case of the plaintiff rested on other witnesses, and the learned judge had reported in favour of the verdict as far as they were concerned. Under these circumstances, though Mr. Baton Platt (who had also heard the argument but w as now absent through illness) entertained inore doubt on the subjectthan the majority of the Court, the result was that the rule must be discharged.

There were several counts relating to different offences and to different persons, and the jury found, &R to the first count, that six of the eight defendants were guilty; as to the fourth, that three of them were guiltv and as to the seventh, that two of them were guilty. This rule was subsequently obtained, on behalf of the defendants, to arrest the judgment, on the ground that the various counts and verdicts 'were inconsistent, and that the proceedings in question were not warranted by the statutes under which the information had been framed. The Attorney-General, Mr. Watson, Mrr. J.

'wILLIAMS. This was a rule for a new trial on the ground of misdirection and on affidavits. The action was for breach of promiise of marriage, which was tried before the Chief Baron last year, when the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff with one farthing damages. The omsdirection imputed to the learned Chief Baron had reference to the mode of estimating the damages, the plaintiff complaining that lisa Lordship, who had imbibced tho impression that the action was an attorney's action, mid had n brought on the principle of " no cure no pay," had directed the jury, if they found the defendant had made any promise, that the breach of such a contract was to be viewed as the breach of any other contract, such as the purchase of a ship or a cargo of hemp would be, and that the damages were to be calculated on the pecuniary loss sustained by the plaintiff, and by that alone, exclusive of her feelmgs, and also of the fact asserted by her counsel, that the defeudant hbad seduced her under the assurance of a promise of marriage. As to the affidavits, the plaintiff and her attorney both deposed that the action wvas bond fide brought on the yetamer of the former; and that she had advanced a sm of money towards the costs, and that it was not the attorney's action or brought on speculation. On the other sIdeL defendant made an afidacvit denying the promise of marriagge and alleged seduction, and showing that his introduct,ion to the plaintiff tookc place in the streets of Bristol, and as4ntimiacy ensued with her vunder the circumlstances which showed her to be a person of loose character. 3Mr. ML Chambers and MEr.

ADMIRALTY COURT. IVEDNsfAv JTA m THE LED.t-SALVAGE: (Before D}. LUsHTNGTo.1 - wl. - 0 V J Wuvmr iasbE, uuring a neavy gale, tne schooner Leda was observed from Blakeney Tow-n running towards the land muder reefed sails, with a flag flying half. most high in her topmast riggng. The life-boat Sailor's Friend was manned with LS hands, nd proceededdown the harbour towards the bar. The schooner was then distant about a nile from the land, but when they had reached the bar, a nile and a-half from the town, she was abott a quarter of a vile fronm them. After boarding her, they brought her round the point into Blakeney ant, an there moored her in safety. They entered an action against her in the sum of 201., to obtain compensation for their services. The owners of the schooner appeared underprotest, and alleged that in and by the Merchant Shipping Act, 17th and 15th of Victoria, chap. 104, sec. 460, it was expresslyprovided that the dispute respecting any salvage wherein the sum claimed by the salvors did not exceed 200l. should be referred Sto the arbitration of two justices resident at or near the place where the ship saved vas 1ying, or resident near the port into -which she was brought after the occurrence of the acident by reason whereof the claim arose ; and that unless the sum claimed exceeded 2001. the Court of Admiralty had no juisdiction. In answer to the act on protest it was submitted, on behalf of the salvors, that the section a'pplied only to the case of any ship or boat which might be stranded or otherwise in distress on the shore of any sea or tidal water within the limits of the united kingdom, and that that was not the case with the schooner. It was further stated that there were no justices of the peace resident at Blakeney, or within six miles thereof, and.t hat, althoughthesalvorsendeavoured to prevail on the miaster of the schooner to allow the question to be settled by some merchants or shipowners at Blakeney, he positively refusecd so to do, or to make them any compensation for their services. In reply, the owners stated that there were two magistrates resident near Holt, within five miles of Blakeney. Dr. Addanis and Dr. Twiss appeared in support of the protest i Dr. Jcnner agaimst it. The learned JcDG.E said, it was admitted on al hands that the Court originally had jurisdiction over such cases, and the only question was whether it had been taken away by the statute referred to. The statute did not relate to -l salvac, but only to salvage limited by the words, " in the united kingdom." 'What was the meaning of that limitation? Was it salvage service performed w ithin the limits of the united kinadom, or salvage rendered anywhere, but the suits brought wvithin the limits of the united kingdom? If he adopted the first construction, which appeared to be the most natural, then arose another question, what were the limits of the united ingdom ? The only answer, he conceived, was, the land, and three miles from the shore. According to that construction, any salvage service 7erformed on the high seas at a greater distance than thrce miles would not come within the operntion of that part of the statute. The second construction would be a very strained one to put on the statute. He must hold that the act contemplated only those services which were rendered within three miles from shore. He was confinned in that view by the words of the 45Sth section. In all such cases-, ifthe claim did not exceed 2001. it was to be referred to two justices of the peace. In the present instince the service was performed within three miles of the shore, though not actually on the very shore itself. The Legislature by the words " distress on the shore" did not mean stranded only, or to confine the operation of the act to what toutched the shore itself. If he was to hold that the statute extended to salvage of property not actualy in contict with the shore, what limits -was e to put? It was impossible to fix the distance unless he resorted to some legalprinciple, and the only effect he could give to the words, "on the shore," and " w,ithin the limits of the united kingdom," was thi that space of sea over which this country claimed jurisdiction, and which, therefore, might be considered within the limits of the united kingdom. e rmust, therefore, pronounce in this case fcr the protest. rim ALEIE ,AND F.ANG1'.-cL 5S FOP P.ESt7TI1ON Or SHP, FREIGHT, UN'D CARGO. Dr. LusTf.TON delivered judgment in this Mase, the facts-of which were reported in The Times of the 19th inst. This was, he said, a Lubeck vessel, laden with a eneral cargo. She sailed fromn Lubeck, and, according to the evidence of the master, Nms bound to Haparanda, in Swedeln -a destination admitted to be lawful. She was captured on the 14th of November last, and the alleged ground of her seizure .and detention was, that she was attempting to break the blockade of the coast of Finland. The existence of the blockade and its legality were not disputed; the point sought to be put in issue was the breach of the blockade. The Court, according to its ordinary practice, looked pri. marily to the ship's papers and the depositions. So far as the bils of lading and documents of that description could tend to prove destination, they all pointed as strongly as such documents could do to a destmation to Haaranda. The master deposed that the ship was seized atout 20 Engtsh miles from land; he could just see the coast of Fin. land, and he supposed thlat they were seized for bein- too near that coast. He put into two ports, but he stated that his proper course was never altered, save to keep free from the Swedish coast. 'When the wind was northeast it was very dangerous, and they were obliged to keep well off the land. He denied all attempts to break the blockade. The evidence of the other two witnesses, so far as it went, tended to support the testimony of the master. It had been argued that there was an inconsistency an the evidence as to the cause of putting into Oregrund and Ulmea, but he did not perceive how such difference could affect the decision of this case. It was perfectly competent for the vessel to go into any Swedish port she pleased, and for any reason she thought fit. He was at a loss to understand h ow entering a Swedish port would affect the question of blockade-how so doing could render a breach of blockade more probable, or tend to prove a breach of bloclade. Reference had been made to the log, and various deductions attemptedtobedrawnfrom the entries therein. Ithad been said that the ship went to Breche and not to Umea-smiea beinmuch higher up. What possible criminal motive coald with any logical deduction be ascribed to such a misdeserintion, if such it were? Theonemightbetheentrancetothe other. The captors had not asked forTrinity masters ; they had not contended that, on the evidence as it now stood, condemnation could be decreed upon the depositions and log. Upon the evidence as it now stood it was impossible for him to say tha.t a breach of blockade had been committed-the only ground upon which condemnation was prayed. He could not require the claimants to produce further proof when already the papers all pointed to a lawful destination and when all the evidence in preparatory was to the same effect. The onus was on the captors, and consequently hemu,t either restore or receive captors' evidence. He consideredthis to be a case in which the denodtions, shipns papers, and log did not afford any groun for reasonable spicion that this ship was committing a breach of blockade. Certain certificates were brought in on behalf of the captors, but they could only be offered as statements of what they Ieced they were desirous of Proving, if they were permitted so to do by the Court. The Court could not receive them as evidence in the first instance, even if they had been presented in the most fornial shape, for the Court was bound, as he thought, when the cause came before him, to hear it upon the original evidence-the depositions and ship' papers. But it lhd always been the practice to permit both the captors and the claimants to state at the hearing any facts they might deem conducive to their interests, and to pray leave to prove them, and for the Court after hearing the Case on the primary evidence, to deal with such applications as itmightthink fit. Under these circumEtances, the prayer of the captor was, that hecshould receive further proof to the effect that the ship was raning to Jacobstadt-a blockaded port; that on seeing two of Ver 3fajesty's ships of vwar she altered her course, was chased, and captured seven miles to the N.N.W. of Jicobetadt. The claimants pryed that he would reject that proof, and decree restitution with costs and damages. The evidence offered by the captors was not as to any collateral point, but for the purpose Of contradicting and disprovingr the original evidence in the caume.. Even wrere it admnitted, and no further evidence offered by the clamnts, the Court would beplaced in the predicament so forcilyi desrbe by Lord Stowrehl, without satisfactory means of deciding upon the credit due to thc rective partiei, But, passgthatby hwould cometothte junjquestion The case as it stood sas a case for restitl tn-ought the Court to receive evidence to contadict the depositions and the ship' papers, and to prove a bWeach of blockade ? He had already; -n other cmses, exptessed his opimion-that the Court ought.not to xeceive such evidence. . ut as some cases had been cited by the counsel for the captors which had not on former occassons been brought under the consideration of Court, he deemed it to be his duty to consider them, and to inquire whether they ought to induce the Cout to depart from its formeropmnion. The difficulty in these questions vwas now greatly augmented, when the consequence might be,,not simple restitution, but condemnation in costs an dauage-a consequence -which formerly would not have followed. The question which he had to investigate was this-whether Lord Stowedl had or had not expressed his judicial opinion sainst the admission of captors' evidence in cases similar to the present. It apeared tolhin that the case of the " Haabet," decide on the 20th of January, 1805, and the case of the "Giertighit," decided on the 25th.of July in that year, furnished conclusive evidence of the Judicial opinion of Lorcl Stowell upon this question and that he had sup;corted such opien byvsy werf,a reasoning. He beheved that he JDrn Lushigton)adnot said, and he certainly did not mean to say, that ntecedent to those casesthere had not been captors;evidence a(hittedin cases similartothe "1sabet." The two cases citedfurnished proof that the evidence of captors in hke cases had been admitted, and the effect of those caseswas that lord Stowel1 held the former instances of admission of such evidence to b)e zlaZ xs, and expressed his opinlion that it would not be ec;e.ient to follow it in future. The caseof the " Der Friede " in 1803, had beendcted byfDr. Deaue, from Dr. Burna6y's notes, but from the minutes in the cause he could not conclude that any formnal prayer was made on behalf of the captors for the admission, of evidence on their part, much less that such evidence was admitted. So far as he could conjecture from rude imperfect materials, the Court heard the statement of the captors and came to the conclusion that, even if it had been admitted, it could not work the effect of condemnation. So far as appeared from the nlnutes, Lord Stowell did not receive the adavits in evidence, but he considered the statement made in such aptors' affdavits, and restored the vesseL. The ca.e was .appealed, and the decree affirmed. Two other cases had been cited by Her Majesty's Advocate-the "Charlotte Christine" and the " Romeo." With respect to the "Romeo" (6, C. Rob., 3W1), the question then under the consideration of the Court-the admission of a document from another ship-depended upon reasons so whollydifferent from the present that it could not be made applicable with any stringency to the case now under consideration. With regard, however, to the general reasoning attributed to Lord Stowell, with all hIs respect for that great judge, he could not concur in it. The Court, as to facts, as to all that related to the ship, and its destination and employment, ought to know nothing but the evidence before it. As to timelaw and the fact ofillocksde of course the case was wholly different. He was bound to declare that he wholly discarded the notion that the Court could act upon any inforniation not judicially broueht before it. The " Charlotte Christine" was decidedafter the "Haabet," but tne captors' evidence was received prior to the decision in the "liaabet." That fact alone would prevent the case of the "Charlotte Christine" from being an authority overruling the "Haabet," even if there were no distinguishing eircumstances. He was indebted to theregistrarforone other case-the "Rapid (Edwards's Ad. .,228). It would appear from the appeal papers that captor's evidence as to the place of capture was admitted in that case, and subsequently to the case of the "Haabet." The report placed the case on an entirely difierent ground -the carrying of despatchfs. He could ndt with certainty say why captors' evidence was admitted; there was, however, confusion in the log. These cases did not in any degree whatever impugn the authority of the deliberate judLgment in the "}laabet," or leavehim anylawful audiust cause for departing from it. It was true, however, as had been urged by Her Majesty's Advocate, that eircunmstances had been somewhat changed-that the captors ran greater eanger of being condemned in costs and damges than they did formerly; but, however that might be a reason for the Judicial Committee to depart from the authority of the !"Hubet," yet he did not think that it Wmas conpetent for him to adopt such a course. If the practice was to be altered in this particular, and if captors' evidence was to be received, it must be the act of a hi,,her authority than his-it must emanate from the Judicial Committee. For these reasons his decree would be as follows :-To reject the prayer of the captors for the admission of the evidence stated, to restore the ship and cargo, but withouz costs and damages, because he thought the place of capture, as described by the master himself, proved that the seizure and detention were not without justifiable cause. He could conceive cases in whIch it might appear from the original evidence and the depositions that there were doubts respecting which it might be just and consisteut with principle to admit captors' evidence; but those were excepted cases, and not, in his judgment, resembling the rresent, and to be determined upon their special circumstances -when they arose. His decree Was founded upon the conviction that no doubt arose upon the primary evidence-namely, the depositions and the ship's papers. This ship was, according to the evidence, taken 20 miles from the coast of Finland. If that was a cause of detention, and justified the introduction of captors' evidence, any vessel navigating the Gulf might be detained on a similar presumption, Decree-Simple restitution. T CLE cHISSYS.-CLAISi For. RETsUrrT1ols orF SIHp, FR1.IGR;T, AND CAeRGO. Dr. LuimS,e.rTo also delivered judgment in this case, the facts of which were reported in lThe Timts of the 19th inst. Had further proof, lie said, been asked by the claimants, he could not have hesitated in allowing it. It appeared, aecording to the evidence of the master himself, that the vessel was 60 or 70 miles out of her course, away from her Troper destination, and in the neighbourthood of a enemy's port. In consequence of the smallness of the property, further proof had not been asked for. He would have restored the vessel, if he could, on payment of captors' etpenses, but he was bound by law to require further proof, and if the parties would not furnish it he must condemn the ship.

THIE PAINA&k DRAFAMOTISA.-UCLAr FOR RE5T5TUI'5O_ OF SBIP. This vessel, mnder Greek colours, in ballast, was captured en the 30th of BMay last in the offing of Odessa. A claim for her restitution was given in by Mr. Zarifi, of Leadenhallstreet, on behalf of Paul Iraelidi, who w'as stated to be a subject of the Kingof Greece. Dr. ADDATATS, on behalf of the claimant, said that this and other vessels had entered Odessa under Servian colours, where they had been detained by the Russian Government, hut were subsequently released. They had, however, incurred certain expenses which their owners were not able to defray. This vessel had been sold to mr. Iaclidi, a Greek merchant then residing at Odessa, but a subject of the King of Greece, who intended to despatch her to Galatz. If he had continued to trade with the ship, though under Greek colours, no doubt she would be liable to condemnation - but it might be that he had a house in Greece, as well as in Russia, and that the vessel vas intended totrade exclusively for that Greek house as a Greek vesseL It might appear that Mr. Iraclidi was at Odessa for a temporary purpose, and that he was about to quit it. He prsyed the Court, under the circumstances, to admit further proof in explanation of the real facts of the case. The "TongeeKlassina" (5, C. Rob., 297) and the " Herm,an" (4, C. Rob, 228) were cases in point. The QuIEES's ADVOCATE, on behalf of the captors, said that he saw no reason whatever for granting the prayer made. The claimant's counsel had not stated what facts were to be proved. The Court had said, in the "-Nina," that it would not_pen a case generaUy. According to the decision in the " Haoop," the case was totaUy dx lesx; and he asked the Court to condemn the vessel for want of a claim, independently of the merits. If the owner was a Russian subject he could not make a claim. -r. Iralidi being resident at Odessa, why did the Greek consul give the vessel a Greek passport? There was nothing to show that he was there accidentally. The cases cited on the other side had no bearing on the present question. Giving a Greek nationality and a Greek dag to aRussian ship ;was not consistent with bone .idcs. Dr. Dxs- .appeared on the same side. The COUR.T reserved its decision. THE 1LSRIELriA-CLAX FOR RESTTUON;. This case was of a precisely similar description to the last. The COURT reserved its judgment.
POLICE. GUnz.Un1-Geor_g* Bath Patman, a 4'ong man of very respectable aPpeaance, was charged with defrauding several persons by means of forged checks. Mfr. Mrllens, the solicitor to the Society of Bankers, ap. peared for the prosecution; and Mr. Wontner apleaied for the prisoner. 2Ur. Henry Potter, an importer of leeches, residing at 60, Farringdon-street, said that while he was out, on the 25th of Janur, a person called with a letter, puiprting tobe signed by a 3Mr. Rppon, a chymist at Berampstead, who dealt with him, and enclosing a check for 301. 1&s., which it requested him to cash. In the afternoon the prisoner called again, when witness asked him if he ws the erson who left the note in the morning, and he said " Yes." He then asked him if he would have any ob. jection to go to the Messrs. Smith, .PFane, and Smith's, to see if the check were properlg signed, and he said " No." The check was dated" "anuar,T 22, 1856,n drawn in favour of "C. Pearse, Esq., or order,' and purporting to be signed by A. Smith Dorrien. He left his preuises with theprisoner, but, en their way to Messrs. Smitl, Payne, and Smith's, he endeavoured to mak chis escanpe but he called the police and gave him into custody. The valuc of the leeches that Mr. Rippon had was something under 10s. .Mr. Charles Edward Webb said, he was in the service of his father, a gold-lace maker, of 23, Old Broad-street. Oa the 20th of December last a person called on him, and represented himself to be about to join the 2d Queen's Regiment. He believed the prisoner to be the man. He gave him an order for some goods, and then produced a check for 69l. 18s., dated the 17th of December, 1855, on Smith, Payne. and Smith, paynble to Mr. Rippon, and endorsed "X. 0. Rippon." The goods ordered were under 20t., and lie was very anxious to receive the difference between that and the check. He gave him 101., and he went away, promising to call again in a week, when he came to towvn; but he never called. Mr. John Lawless said, he was clerk to 3fessrs. Smith, Payne, and Smith. Colonel Dorsien lived at Berkhamr stead, and kept an account at their house. The two checks produced were taken from the book produced. Those checks were not in Colonel Donrien's handwriting. Cross-examined by M£r. Wontner.-It was a very bad initation of Colonel Dorrien's handwriting. Police-constable 288 said, he took the prisoner into eustody, and at the station he searched him. Me found on him the check-book produced, four 51.-notes, 61. 2s. 6d. in a portmionnaie, 17. 2s.2d. loose in his pocket, and two snall foreign coins, a gold watch, chain, and seals, a gold ring, a small memorandum book, and a knife. The nisoner at the station said, " I did this to oblige a friend, but I did not think it would come to this." Mr. Martin Ridley Smith said, he was; in the house of Smith, Payne, and Smith. On the 20th of December last momn person brought the letter produced, which purported to be signed by Colonel A. Smith Dorrien, asking for a check-book, and he gave the check-book produced to that person. To the best of hisbelief the prisoner at the bar was that person, but he could not be positive. Mr. Charles John Sanders said, he was in the service of Messrs. Hunt and Roskell, jewellers and silversnithp, of 150, New Bond-street. On the 20th of December last some person called on him and had a conversation w,ith himn. The hair of the prisoner seems darker than that of that person, but in all other respects he had no nmoral doubt that le was the same. He had his hat en, and wore a white neckerchief, which he wore with a9small tie. He said he was the Rev. George Carpenter of Berkhamstead. He wrote that name in witness's beok, and said that he was recommended by Lady Alford. He first requested change for a check for 113!. I1s., on Smith, Payne, and Smith. *'iltness banded the check to the enshier,vwho told him he had not sufficient cash in the house. He then said that lie wanted some silver spoons and forks, and he selected a silver inkstand, which was to be presented to ILady Alford in acknowledgment of her recent kindness to him. He wrote in the book an inscription to be engraved on it, and then made an arrangement for some goods he had purchased to be sent by rail to Berkhampstead. The prisoner then said he had some purchases to make in Pall-mall, and if he could let him have part of the money it would do-about 251., and the remainder night be sent by post, in a registered letter, to the Rev. George Carpenter, Berkhamnpstead. He then handed the check to the cashier, who gave him 307. in three 101.- totes. Mr. John Sullivan, the cashier to Messrs. Hunt and Roskell, identified the check produced as the one referred to by the last witness. The check was for 1131. 10s., and he bad endorsed on the back of it the numbers of the three 10.-notes he had given in exchange for it. It was dated the 19th of December, 1855, drawni in favour of the Rev. George Carpenter, or order, and signed. "A. Smith Dornen." Trlhe pisoner at the bar was the person to whom he gave the three 101. notes. Mr Stephen Shirley said, he was in the service of Messrs. Spalding and Hodge, stationers, of 145,140, and 147, Drurylane. On the 7th of January some person went to his place with the note produced. He thought it was the younman at the bar. It contained a check for 501. 12s., datea January 4, 186, on Smith, Payne, and Smith porting tobe signed by A Smith Dorrien, payable to ir. Pearse. The letter purported to be signed by Mr. Gale, requesting him vwitness) to send certa=in packets of paper and cash for the check. He went to 3r. Spalding, and from himn to Mr. Hedge, with the note. He gave the check back to the person, and his impression was that lie inclosed it in a note, statingthat it anted theindorsement of Mr. Pearse. At that time the namie of Pearse was net on the back of the check. Mr. James fodge said, he was in the service of Messrs. Spalding and Hodge. On the Sth of January he received a note, inclosing a check for 50L. 12s., on which was the endorsenment of John Pearse. The prisoner was not the person who brought it. He gave the person who brought it a check of the firm for the same amount on the London and Westmnister Bank, and addressed the note to Mr. H. Gale. Mr. H. Gale, a chyniist and druggist, of 3, 31illbrookplace, Haampstead-road, said, the prisoner had been in his servee from November, 1852, to Iarch, 1854. He cane to himn from Berkhainpctead frora witness's brother, who is also a chymist and druggist there. He was acquaintedwith his handwriting. These letters to Mlessrs. Spalding and Hodge were not signed by him, although they bore his name. The whole of the letters produced were in the nrisoner's handwriting. On the checks he recognized a portion of the prisoner's handwriting, but it was not so palpable as in the letters Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Algernon Smith Dorrien said, he was lieutenant-colonel of the Hlertfordshire Militia, and lived at Berkhampstead. He kept an account at Smith, Payne, and Co.'s. The order for the check-book and the four checks were not in his handwriting, nor were they signed by his autliority. 3Ir. 'ontncr declined to make any observation at the present stage of the proceedings. Mr. Mullens sai', he proposed pressing the charge of the check for 30L. 18s., and producing the ether evidence merely to prove a guilty knowledge. ,he prisoner was then fully committed for trial. BOW-SThEEr.-Mr. Morse, the watchmaker of Charing cross, and 31r. H. Good, of 3, Lyall-street, attended before Mr. JAnRDINE, upon a friendly summons, to show cause why they detained a valuable gold watch, the property of Mr. W. Tinloch, the cook at the Guards' Club-house. It appeared from the statement of the complainant's solicitor, Mrr. Lewis, jun., that Mr. Morse was only nominally a defendant in the ease, it beinm the desire of that gentleman to restore the watch to its rightful owner, under the direction of the magistrate. The wateh was originally purchased of Mr. 3forse by the complainant for 28!., but shortly afterwards it was stolen from him at a publichouse in the Borough. This occurred on the 1st of May, 1851 ;and, although information was given to the police immediately, snd a full description of the watch, with its maker's name, number,; din., sent round to every pawnbroker in London, nothingmore was heard of it until a few days since, when 3Mr. Good brought it to Mr. Mforse to be repaired. Mr. Morse, Temembering that it was the watch which haa been stolen from complainant, at once communicated the fact to the latter. Inquiry was instituted, and it then transpired that Mr. Good had purchased it about 1S months ago of his father-in-law, a Mr. Edwards, awnbroker, of 162, High-street, Hoxton Old-town, for 91. t futrher appeared that the watch was pledged at Edward's shop foroL by a wonman named Harriet Bart three days after the robbery, and one day after the information had been sent round to the pawnbrokers; and Mr. Edwards admitted that he never offered it for sale at the customary trade auction, but wore it for a year after the ticket had expired, and then put it in his window for sale. He denied, however, that he nad ever seen the notice respecting the property which, it was alleged, had been left at his house. Mr. JAIRDINE reminded the pawnbroker that he was liable to a penalty of 101. for neglecting to dispose of the watch in the way directed by the act of Parliament, and no magistrate, after hearing all the circumstances of this case, would hesitate to impose that penaltv upon him. He was happy to say that the pawnbrokers in his district conducted ther business in a very diHferent mauer. He advised the immediate restoration of the watch to the complainant and the repayment of the 91. to Mr. Good. After a shorL adjournment, to afford an opportunity for arrangement, it was intimated that his Worship's suggestion had been acted upon; consequently, the summons was dismisced. WExSTsSTnc.-9s. lld. in postage stamps was received from " H. S." for the poor-box, WORSwMS-SmEavAdolph Nitsche, a tall, respectablydressed German, and louisa Amelia Nitsche, his wife, a dark-complexioned woman of 40, were charged before Mr. DYEX COURT on suspicion of feloniously receiving two %ldd watches, part of an extensive robbery practised upon r. Dent, the chronometer-maker of the Strand end Royal lixch-nie. Mr.-A'enry Newton, manager of tshe Roy malEchag b.anch of e rosecutor's business, stated,thatonthe mntring of Mond y, the 21st inst., a well-dressed German entered the shen), and, aftr looking at some of the goods, ordered a selectiohn of gold watches to be at once forwarded to, his counting-house in Addle-street, Wood-street, Cheapside. He gave his name as Fischer, and described himself as a merchant, and witness therefore packed np 21 watches, of the value altogether of 2501., which he delivered to a shopman, with directions to call at Addle-street for the purpose of selection. The man was gone a much logrtime t -a necessry, ana on isi coming back =reued .without the property. From the man's statement i then appeared that the person who had given the order for the goods had met himn at the house in Addle-stree', and, req;estingpermission to exhibit them to a ladywho was engaged in an inner apartment, he delivered them to him fr that p ose, taking up his station in such a position as to seemingly preclude any fraud, but that after waiting some time and becoming uneasy he made inquiry and a search, and discoveredI that he had escaped through a fir-st. floor- vndow, and absconded with all the property. Two gold watches nlow produced by the policehe could positively identify 2S a portion of the goods so stolen. Joseph Broo,shoprnato a pawBnbroker named Froyd, noon t-he femaepiorenrd the ho and offered one of the watches prodced inpledgc for 41. On exainin8 it he. found that it bore the name of 3fr. Dent, and, knowing this robbery, he referred to the-list of articles stolen, and, findingit to be-one of them,.heodetained her and gave her into custody. - Barry, a constable of the H division -stated, that on tahing tho prisoner into custody on the charge. of the last witness he lodged her in the station, and then went to her lodgings in Wagner's-buildings, Cower-walk, Whitechapel, where he found the male prisoner. He took him into custody upon suspicion of benig concerned in the robbecry, and informed him of his having already secured his wife, on which he said, "Oh, she is my woman; she bought the thcket of a watch from a man at the Eagle Saloon, in the City-road, for a pound." The prisoner said he had had other watches in his possession.. v -Mr. D'EYNCOURT asked if the female prisoner had stated where she had obtained this watch from? Mr. Strauss, the interpreter in the case, said,-Yes; she tells me she got it from a pawnbroker's in Addle-street, that she went there in a cab and got it out of pledge, and that the ticket vas sold to her by a man named Jewry, whom she danced with at the Eagle Saloon, and that after she had done so he asked her ff she would buy the duplicate of a gold watch, for which he wanted 80s., and that she gave him a pourd for it. There is a passport in which the two prisoners are described as man and wife, her rme being there stated as Caroline Emily Nitsche. This was one case, and in the other John Healey, shopman to a pawnbroker in St. George's-in-the-East, produced a second gold watch, pledged at his employer's on the 22d inst. by the female prisoner for ., she asking 41. on it. She gave the name of Nitzk, as it sounded to him, but a great mlany foreigners aene to their shop, and ho spelt their names as well as he could. She pawned it at 12 in the day; the list of stolen proPerty was notdelivered till 5, or he should in all probability have stopped it. The trade value of the watch was 41. 10s. Mr. Newton.-Its value is 131., and it is one of the stolen watches. Female 'Prisoner.-This pawnbroker's evidenoe is not true; I was not there. Shopman.-I am positive she is the same woman. Offlcer.-The dupliuate for this watch is not found, but I produce a number ofothers, found in her trunk, and one for wearing apparel, pledged only the day before the robbery for 3s. MIr. ])'Eveousrr.-That is important, as showing her previous want of money. N~either priSOner offered any further defence, and Mr. D'Evl;cowv said that he did not consider there was any charge against the male prisoner, whose conduct, on the contrary, appeared to have been as straightforward as could be expected, but he should remand the woman for a week, to give an opportunity for tracing the remainder of the Property. The male prisoner then said,-I recollect, some time a gjo, when w lvent home, a person named Flitic gave her te ticket of a watch, and offered to eell her another, but I don't know if :Flitie and Jewry are the same. MIr. ]Ylivxcoeo T.-I cannot receive the husband's evidence for the wife. Female Prisoner.-My husband bought the ticlket of the watch. She was then locked up in the cells. T.AtSrS.-John Hayes, aged 18, and George Thompson, 19, were brought up on remandbefore Mr. INGRAa,Charged with assaulting and robbing George Nicholas, an Italian. The prisoners made no defence, and Mlr. LmnA&m committed them for trial. SourawtARX.-Mr. A'BcxRETT yesterday received 10s. in postage stamps from "H . S." for the poor-box, with the request of an acknowledgment in The Times. LAaransTr.-`illiam fBurs, James Winter, and Isaac Jones, fhe former a foreman and confidential servant, and the two latter workmen in the establishment of Messrs. Walker, Parker, and Co, lead merchants and shot manufacturers, in the Belvidere-road, Lambeth, who have been in icustody for some days past on a charge of being concerned with others in carrying on a most extensive system of plunder on their employers, were again placed at the bar refore M. EluOTT for further examination. A fourth prisoner was for the first time placed at the bar, iin the person of Mr. Henry Smith, the landlord of the King's Arms publichouse, in Roupel-street, Lambeth, who wvas said to be a man of considerable property, and who was charged vith receiNing a portion of the stolen property with Ia mrit knowvledge. r. Parry, instructed by Mr. Hiumphreys, jun., attended for the prosecution; Mr. Talfourd Salter, the barrister, for Smith; a barrister, instructed by Mr. Solomon, for Burns; Mr. Lewais for Winter; and Mr. Xeile for the prisoner Jones. X3r. Parry having stated the nature of the charge against each prisoner, and the substance of the additional evidence which it was his intention that day to call against each, desired Isaac Davis to be called and sworn. 'Ehis was done, and the -witness so sworn deposed that he was a shotmaker, and had been in the service of the prosecutors for 11 years, and knew Burns, the prisoner, and Underwood, the witness in attendance. On Christmas-eve last the prisoner Bums sent him (witness) and Underw-ood and Jones with three bundles of lead pipe, " weighing about three-quarters of a hundred each bundle," to the Wellington Arms beershop,in the Waterloo-road, and which is kept by a man named Price. This property was not to his (witness's) knowledge entered in any book, nor had he taken any invoice with it, nor received any moniey for it from Price. It was taken between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and was deposited in the cellar of Price's house. m Price gave him (witness) a goose to take back to Burns. David Haul=n said, he was a labourer employed in the sliot manufactory belonging to the prosecutors, and accompanied the last witness on Christmas-eve to the beershop of :rice in the Waterloo-road, and carried one of the bundles of p John Jones, another workman, deposed to the same effect. William Underwood deposed to having taken, two bags of shot to Price's, the Wellington Arms beerhouse, durinn the last summer by Burns' direction, and leaving them tAere. He took no invoice then, nor received anything in payment for them. The bags of shot weighed 281b. each, and were of the value of 6s. or 7s. each. The witness further deposed, that on the 20th of October last he took six bags of shot, by direction of the prisoner Burns, from the factorv to the house of Mr. Smith (the prisoner), the King's Arms, in Boupell-street, lanibeth, each bag weighing 281b. He camned them in two journeys of three bags each, and Burns desired him to give them to Mr. Smith ;with his oomplimnents. He took themn from the factory without making any entry of them in any hook himself, or their being entered by anybody else, and he had not taken an invoice or received any m oneyfor them. Itwas hisr, lace as warehouseman to deliver shot fiom the shot-loft, but not to enter it in the books; that was the duty of the prisoner Burns or the clerks. Burns said nothing to him (witness) about entering-the sliot in question. In his cross-examination on behalf of the prisoner Burns, the wvitness said, that there did not appear to him there was any concealment in the matter, and he had no suspicon at the time that the transaction was not an honest one. In his re-examination respecting the prisoner Sniith the witness said, that he delivered the whole of the six bags of shiot to that person. When he took the first three he said, " Mr. Snmith, there are six bags of shot for you from MWr. Bumns, and I have brought the first three," but he could not recollectvwhether Mr. smith bad made any reply or not. The first three bags he brought he handed over the counter to Mr. Smith, and he put them underneath, out of the sight of ally one standing in front of the countdr, and witness recollected then saying that Mr. Burns had sent his compliments to him. He did not receive anything from Smith. .Mr. ELLoT.-Are you in the habit of carrying out shot from the factory of your employers ? Witness.-Nlo, Sir, I am not. I never took out any before. The witness was further cross-examined by Mr. Salter on behalf of his client, Mr. Smith, but nothing material was elicited. Police-Sergeant George Budd, 9 L, said, that on the 12th inst. he went to the house of MIr. Smith, and on seeine him asked if he had got a bill or invoice for the six bags of shot that he had received from Mr. Burns, from the shot factory in the Belvidere-road ? Smith rephed, "I received no six bags of shot, I received three bags of shot; the man who said six was a - liar, and you may go and tell him so." Witness then asked him if he had a bill for the three that he had had 9 aud he said he had no bill; that he had asked Bums for it several times, but never had a biU or paid for it. Witness then told him he might require his presence in 3 day or two, and he said he would come to any =eal place, but he would not go anywhere else to throw vwater on a drowned rat. Witness went to MIr. Smith's house aain on the 14th inst. to serve him with a summons, and he then said, " You are right about the six bags ; I suppose you got it out of the books." Sergeant Harris, 6L, corroborated the testimony of the last witness, and, Mr. Walker, the prosecutor, got into the witness-box, and said that he had looked through his books, and could findno entry of the six bags of shot to Mr. Smith, nor the lead pipe or the two b of shot to Price. Mr. Walker added, that Smith was unknown to him, and was no customer of his or of his partners. The business of the firm was with builders and persons purelsasifig largely, and not with public or beerhouse keepers. The firm was in the habitof selling as small a quantity as six bags of shot to their friends, but not less than that quantity to any one. 'Mr. Parry here said that this was all the evidence he purported to offer that day, and as the firm, assisted by the officers, wfere still pursung theirinquiries into this extensive system of plunder, he had to apply for a further remand. MIr EBo1T granted the request of the learned gentleIman -but on an application by their legal advisers, he adI mitdSihadVne to bail, but refuLsed bail for the I others. The cour, as on all occasions when the prisoners havo been examined, was crowded in every part with well-dressed persons, all of whom seemed to take the greatet possible inmterest in the ~proceedinngs. After the prisoners had been removed Mr. Solomon made an application to Mr. Elliott for a summons against Sergeants Budd and Harris for an excess of duty. Mr. Solomon stated that on the night before these two officers went to the house of Mr. Dawson, a bargebuilder, and a most respectablo man, but who happens to be the brother-in-law of Burns, one of the prisoners in the last case, and asked if he had a chain belonging to Mressrs. Walker andiCo., of the Belvidere-road, on his premises? Mr. Dawson replied, that he had ; told them that he had beenjin the habit of borrowing from and lending things to the Messrs. Walker - and pointed out the chain to the officers they inquired abot. They (the officers) were not satisfied with taking away the chain, but also took away his client, M. Dawson, and kept him in custody atthe.station for seven or eight hours, when they thought proper to let him go at large. Mr. ELLorT recommended that % complaint should, in the first instance, be forwarded to the Commissioners of Police, and, if they did not order an investigation, Mr. Solomon, on a future application, might have the summons a$ required. -Mr. Solomon said, he should act on his worshWs suggestion ; and thus the nmatterrests.
FATAL POISONING AT DINGMWALL. TO TEE EDITO0 SO TE TDIMES. Sir,-Eaving heard and read of several cases of fatal poisoning by wolfs-bane root, mistaken for horseradish, I have fiequently adNised cottage gardeners to extirpate the acrid plant, and have often been laughed at for my spite against a pretty, though lurid, blue flower. Monl's-hood orwolf's-bane (aconituss napedlus), is so acrid, especialythe root, that it was formerly used in baited traps to poison wolves. The lurid blue flower, easily known by its neat arrangement of petals, the upper one resembling a closely compressed hood, is very common in the gardens round London and in all parts of the country. Children often amuse themselves by pulling apart the petals, and exposing the curious pistil and stamens. It should be generally known that aconite is the most dangerous of all the poisons of the crow-foot tribe, not merely on account of its acridity, bat also for its liability to be mixed with horseradish. If eaten alone wolf's-bane root would excite alarm, but if mixed with horseradish (perhapamade more pungent bytheaddition of both vinegar and mustard) a fatal dose might easily be taken, and the poisoned man would observe only that the radish was rather too bitmn. These facts are enough to show that the fatal p lant ought not to be allowred to grow near edible herbs, and it would bc better to banish it from our cottage gardens. I would take this opportunity of suggesting that a knowzledge of our common and dangerous vegetable poisons ought to be imparted to children in our coummon schools It would be an easy task, for there are only 14 or 15 that may he regarded practically as dangerously poisonous. At present, out of 20 "well educated youths," all learned in G~reek mythology, you might hardly fid one acquainted with the structure, habits, and properties of such common British plants as briony, the nightshades, hemlock, henbane, dropwvort, or this favourite aconite. vwhich has uroved so Ihtal.

THE LTE Mlu,zDEB : BuRNorpma.-We a. short time ago stated that 501. reward was offered for tho recovery of the watch stolen from the person of Mr. RobartSterling, vho was murdered near Bunopfield, on the Ist of November last. Since the appearance of that pragraph lMjor WVhite, the chief constable of the county of Dnrham, has received a letter from Messrs. J. and W. Todd, of Glasgow, correting a mistake made in the former description of the watch. As this inadvertent error on the part of the iatchmakers may have been-the cas se of the hitherto. unsuccessful endeavours ofthe police to recover the lost watch, the corrected description is hereuith annexed, which is taken from an excactly smilar watch furnished by the Messrs.

THE CENTRAL ABRICWAN QUESTION. ThA Wlich may be called the Central Amr ean 'questi, and which has recently been the, . of c~esonclenee between Great Brstat nctid the ITnitdStates, is sutbject to three1, divisions:3iFs what were the rights Of 'itret Britain in Ce.*ntral Ameriea ? and t'n2 posltion she had csumed previous to 1850 ' Secondly, what were the causes which led to t'ie trcaty called the Bul'wer and Clayton Treaty, which took plae in 1850, and the precise simtstion in which it was intended that that tre&ty should place the contracting parties ? Thirdly, wh3t aihe difficullties wvhiclh at this time exist, and howv £S.rare they connected with or distinct fromi the treaty in question?2 The treaties of Great 13rit&in during the last contury with Spain left her, at Belize, a settlement established for the p 0rpose of Cuttting lowood, amd evidently restricted within those limits 'which the object for which it was granted rendered necessary. By the same treaties Great Britain was bound to withdraw from the Mosquito coast, on which there wva-s a considerable tribe of Indians, who, in her wars with Spain, had acted witlh her as aIles. At the beginning of the present century a new state of things had arisen,--wars between Great Britain ind Spain had. taken place. After a time the Spanish colonies of South America had throwvn off fthe Spanlish yoke. During these changes and revoltions CGreat Britain had enlarged her settlement of 3elize and given to it considerable territorial dimensions; she had reconnected herself, also, with theM3IosquLito Indian s, taling their chief or king again under her protection, having him solemnly crowned at .amaica. In the meantime, the Isthmus which separates worth from Southl America, and which is hence called " Central America," had been divided into different Republics, according to the different captain-generalships or provinces which had existed under the old rtle. The Captain-Generalship of Nicaragua became the Republic of Nicaragua, the Captain-Generalship of Costa Rica the Republic of Costa Rica, &c. On the confines of these two States, and at the mouth of the river Sanu Juan, was a small tolwn and territory claimed by both Nicaragua and Costa Ri.ca,for as these republies derived their riohts, as has been observed from the old captain-generalships, and as these captain-generalships often varied in extent, according to the rank and ability of the Governors or Captaiin-Generals placed over themii, their frontier could not be very precisely defined. The towvn and territory above alluded to, were, however, at the period here spoken of, in the possession cf Nicaragua. Many vexatious proceedings took place at this port with resRect to foreign vessels visiting it ; and the British Government, having been informed by its different agents in Central America that the port in question had auciently belonged to the Mfosquitos, claimed it in their behalf, and, on the NLicaraguans refusing to give it up, seized it by force in the name of the -Mosquito King. The Nicaraguans complained; their complaints wvere unheeded; the papers relative to this transaction were laid before the British Parliament; no objections were raised in Parliamuent as to the coulse -which the British Government had pursued, and the honour of Great Britain became henceforth pledged to support what her Government had done. About this time the United States took possession of California, and made that discovery of its mineral wealth which has given a new tendency to the destinies of that part of the world. The attention of American citizens was thus necessarily bent on obtaining the shortest and niost convenient road to their new conquest. Central Anerica assimed a new position in their eves, and our protectorate of the Mosquito coast attracted their attention-the more especially as the Micaragnans had for sonle time been claiming their assistance against what they deemed British aggression. Mloreover, there seemed a strong probability that it might be possible to establish a ship-canal between the Atlantic and the Pacific by way of the riven San Juan, at the mouth of which, as it has been stated, the towvn wve had recently taken, and which since its captuire had been called "cGreytown," was s:tuated. Accordingly the Government of M1r. Polk (the Democratic party in the United States was then in power) before leaving office sent an agent, "-ir. Hise," to the Government of Nicaragua, and M)r. Hise concluded a treaty with the said Goverranent reconizing the right of Nicaragua to that tou-n and portion of tenitory which Great Britain had just tak}en from her, and agreeing to aid in regainim,,it. President Taylor, who shortly afterwards succeeded 'Mr. Polk (the WVhig party in this election sueceeding the Democratic), did not entirely approve Mr. Hise's treaty; but he sent another agent, MIr. Squirs, to Nicaragua, charged with a nussion similar to that whiclh had been confided to MIr. Eise. This gentleman, Mllr. Squirs, also recognized the right of Nicaragua to the town and territory in cispute; and simiiultaneously an American company obtained a concession fiom Nicaragua for the purpose of establishing a ship canal communicacation of the steam navigation of the river San Juan, and of certain lands thereto belonging. It is easy to perceive that in this manner the American company came into collision with the Government of Alosquito, iunder the protection of Great Britain, at Greytown. Moreover, the two American agents representing the two great parties in the American commonwealth had acknowledged the right of Nicaragua to this town and poit, and that right had become identified, through the company just referred to, with the rights of American citizens. Nothing was wanting but that the treaty of MIr. Squirs, which was concluded by the agent of President Taylor, should be accepted by the American Senate in order to place Great Britain and the United States in a hostile and conflicting position. Such was the state of things when Sir Henry Bulwer went to the United States, and 211r. Lawrence came to this country. A negotiation commenced between Lord Palmerston and Mra-. Lawrence, whiclh produced no final arrangement; but it would appear from the papers laid before Congress that in the course of it Mr. Lawrence inquired whether Great Britain meant to occupy, fortify, colonize, or take possession of MIosquito, or any part of Central America; and that Lord P.almerston declared that Great Britain abjured all notion of doing any of these thimgs. It wvould also appear that in the correspondence which took place between Lord Palmerston and 3Ir. Lawrence it was greed that the two Governnients of Great Britain and the United States would be willing to protect the construction, and the free passage when constructed, of any railway or ship canal that might unite the two oceans. 7n this manner the jealousy of the American Go-ernment and the interests of the American Company were both conciliated. But while this negotiation was proceeding in London the American people had become more and more excited against Great Britain. Tiger Island, off the coast of Rondurns, had been taken by a British ship of war at the instigation of Mlr. Chatfield, the British Chargd cl'Aaires in Central America; the treaty of M1r. Squires was about to be adopted by [the American Senate, which began to apprehend serious plans of conquest on the part of Great Britain. Once adopted, Great Britain would either have to give up to the United States, a powerful State, what she had refused to give up to Nicaragua, a weak one, or she would have to go to war with the United States on account of this small conquest, in the name of a semibarbarous race of Indians, and have placed thereby an impediment in the way of that great enterprise (the canal conumunication betnweej the Atlanticand-Pacific)whichappeared at that momentlikely to be undertaken, and which it was the common interest of the whole world to promote. Nor was this all; the connexion re-established umder very different circunstances with the Mosquito people was now evidently about to assume a new and a very onerous character, and while it was impossible for Great Britain to recede from it disgracefully or discreditably, it was her interest to do so in any honourable way that presented itself. Under these circumstances, the project of a treaty was drawn up by MIr. Clayton and Sir Henry Bulwer, which contained a clause to the effect that if such treaty was approved by the two Governments, no other treaty was to be sanctioned which differed n spirit or intention from it. This clause as intended to stop all further proceedings with respect to the treaty of Mr. Squirs, and ultimately necessitated the abstraction from that treaty of the objectionable and hostile articles. TIhe rest of the project was derived altogether from hlr. Laurence's correspondence with Lord Pelhthehttn. It did away with the possibility of eitner Great Britain or the United States edtablishing themselves permanently on that region, which seemed likely to become tho causeviay between two great commnercial worlds, anld it prescribed that all cormunications byd Pacific wvere to be opened to the subjects of Great Britain and the citizens of the UJnited States, and indeed to all the world, on equal terms; while the same communications were to be placed under the joint protection of the two Governments. This project, having been sent to England and submitted to the British Goverment, which fully approved it, became a treaty. The terms by which Great Britain and the United States were restricted from any hold on the Central American isthmus were copied rerbatinm from the conumiications between the American M1inister in London and the British M1inister of Foreign Affairs, and were to this effect, viz. :-That neither Great Britain nor the United States should occupy, fortify, colonize, or take possession of the coast of Mosquito, or any portion of Central America, whether in their own right or in right of any protection they might or did afford to any people or State in Central America. The apparent purpose of the United States in this article was to prevent Great Britain by fortifications and armies from establishing herself as the protector of the Mosquitoes on the Mlosquito coast. The apparent object of GreatBritain was to strip her Mosquito protectorate of all that was odious and suspicious therein to the United States, and to prepare the way for retiring honourably from the whole business of the protectorate. The main reason wly this could not be done at once wvas, that it would be necessary in doing it to decide to whom Greytown could be most safely and rightfully given up, and also to provide for some mcans of protection for our old allies the Indians when Great Britain withdrew from protecting them ; for wvhich long negotiation there was not suificient time, Mr. Sqnirs's treaty being before the Senate, and some decision imminent. IBut no sooner was the treaty concluded than Great Britain proposed at once to the United States to concert and agree with her as to these twno points, and thus to make the convention complete by carrying out its intentions to their full extent. MIr. ebster entered into the spirit of this proposal, and negotiations were proceeding favourably for that object wvhen that statesman died; and it is r.-markable that Mr. Webster, of all mcn the most acute in comprehension and who, being likewise a candidate for the Presidency, was not likely to construe any public instrtumenit unfavourably to his coiuntry, never raised any question as to the nature and import of words, which have, since M1r. Pierce entered into office, been the subject of so much discussion. It is here onily briefly to be observed that the settlement of Belize and its island dependencies were expressly set apart from the treaty of 1850, and left in the same condition in wlhich it had found them. The foregohig narrative will make clear the position of Great Britain prior to the Clayton and Bulwer convention, the circumstances which led to that convention, and the intention which the contracting parties seem to have canied into it. It now only remains to state the points which are at present in dispute between the two Gover-nments, and to show how far they are connected with or distinct from the treaty of 1850. The first dispute raised is as to the right which Great Britain had to re-establish her protectorate over the MNosquito coast -without the express consent of Spain, after her old treaties with that Power. This question, though distinct from, has practically merged in the second point in dispute, which is,as to the meaning of the agreement, not to occupy, fortify, colonize, or take possession of the MKosquito coast or any part of Central America. The United States' Government now assert that this engagement exacted the immediate and total withdTrawal of Great Britain's protection from the M3osquito coast. The British Government aflirms that it meant merely what it stated-viz., an engagement not to occupy, fortify, colonize, or take possession of MIosquiito, or any part of Central America, in right of such protection. An important consideration here presentz itself. If the promise not to occupy, colonize, fortify, or take possession of Mosquito afford matter of dispute, that dispute would have arisen if no treaty had existed, since the words thus cited in the convention had been used previous to it, and these words being merely copied from former documents cannot create new obligations. The treaty, therefore, of 1850 cannot be chargeable with a misfortune which, at all events, if the Government of the United States were animated by its present disposition, would have occurred. But what are the real merits of this difference as to the construction of the above-cited paragraph? The UTnited States contend that the engagDement not to occupy or fortify is an engagement not to protect. But the main purport of tlle treaty is to protect all railways and canals in Central America, and, notwithstanding tlis, the two parties are neither of them to occupy or fortify any portion of Central America; it is clear, therefore, that these parties foresaw the probability of doing the one thing without doing the other. Again, the treaty declares, not only tlat Great Britain and the United States shall not occupy, fortify, &c., in their own right, but that they shall not do these things in right of any protection they may or do afford to any State or people in Central America. Vill any jurist, for one instant, pretend that, wien you say you are not to do certain things in right of some general powver, this engagement does more than limit that power, or that the provisions for limiting a power do not plainly iiidicate that such power is possible, and known to exist ? The words in question, if inselted by the American Government, surely show that the American Government thought that the protection of Great Britain still existed, and that she might attempt to do as protectrix what she could not do as sovereign. On the other hand, if they were suggested by the British Government, they as surely manifest that that Government was anxious that it should be understood that though it at once abandoned most of the rights of a protectorate, that protectorate was not yet altogether given up. In order, however, tomake this yetmore clear, thereis the fact ti'at Great Britain negotiated immediately after the treaty with the most eminent statesman and jurisconsult in the United States, and that he understood the treaty as Great Britain understood it. Nor was he alone. MIr. Filmore, who was President after General Taylor's demise, was Vice-President when the treaty was signed, and member of the Senate which approved of it. Mr. King, Chairman of Foreign Relations in the Senate diuing General Taylor's life, was Vice-President at his death. General Toote who became at the same time Chairman of the Committee of ForeignRelations, hadbeenasenator inthe Democratic partypreviously. It is, therefore, necessary to suppose not only that Mr. Webster -was completely wvrong in the view fhat he took, but also that he acted without consulting al those persons he was boumd to consult when he took that view, in order to bear out the opinion, which three or four years after the conclusion of the treaty is now started in the United States. It is easy, indeed, to see that the British Minister, in agreeing to the project of a treaty at eashington, cautiously confined himself to approving only those words which had previously been employed by his Government at home, and of w;hich that Govermnent itself could best understand the mean- ing. For him to have added to or explained those .ords would, it is true, have been an act of unjustifiable imprudence; and he did his duty when he gavethat opportlunity to his chief, who, as the projectwas submitted to him, could have made any alterations or additions he thought advisable. But Lord Palmerston. no mean judge of such words, made no addition to or alteration of them; and he could have made none advisedly. wINr. Lavrence had, relative to the question at issue, asked a question; the British Government had answered it-a treaty embodying that question and answer effected, it might be supposed, the principal objects of the two parties. Moreover, the United States did not acknowledge the Mosquito Protectorate. A treaty directly denying itsvalidity was then before the United States' Senate for approval; Great Britain could not, therefore, expect that the United States should recognize such -rotectorate any more than that she, Great Britain, should abandon it. The British Government, by the treaty, deprived her auithority in Mosquito of that character which natmually provoked dispute, and left the rest, which in no wise touched the immediate interests of the United States, in sia quo, with the idea of dealing with a subject which no longer seemed likely to cause any essential point of difference in the most convenient manner and at the earliest opportunity. The treaty was not, in short, in all respects, a final andconclusive measure; it settled some diffculties defiiitely; it threw a bridge over others; which was likely to lead to a definite erangement of them. It decided, in short, all that was of real aond urgent importance, and only left unsettled a temporary question of trivial import, which ought not to occupy the attention of two great nations for a moment. The BritishGovernment has, indeed, as we believe, proposed since to the United States Government to consider, first, the opposing claims of Nicaragua and Costa Rica to Greytown; secondly, the advisability of leaving that town in the hands of the people from various countries, but especially from the United States, wsho now reside in and govern it, creating ottt of these elements a free town at the entry of what may become an importtant river, and has offered to come to an .amicable understsanding with the lUnited States as to which of these twvo plans is preferable. The British Government has also, we understand, proposed to the United States to restrict the rule of the M1osquitos within a particular and limited region, and to provide for theprotection of those Indians waithout any necessity for British interference. The United States' Government, since the accession of the present party to power, has insisted on Greytown and the whole AMosquito territory being altogether andunconditionally suirrendered to the Nicaraguans, which, from preceding events, would be humilitating to Great Britain and hard and unjust to Costa Rica, on the one hand, and to the aboriginists on the other; and which, moreover, if the demand in question had been complied with, would at this time h.ave placed the whole region in the hands of a set of marauders from Californiawho are now domineering over Nicaragua, and committing every species of cruelty and depredation; and this, apparently, in spite of the United States' Government itself, to which Captain Walker and his associates owe allegiance. Such is the state of the question as to Greytown and Mosquito. The other two subjects of dispute betwveen Great Britain and the United States relate to the extension which, since 1786, has been given. to the settlement of Belize, and as to the occupation and colonization of two islands, Ruatan and Bonaca, which have been occupied and colonized since 1850 by Great Britain. With these questions the treaty of 1850 has nothing to do. The settlement of Belize and its island dependencies -were left untouched by the treaty. But the United States' Government deny that the settlement of Belize can be extended beyond its ancient boundaries without the consent of Spain, and that theislandsreferred to areor everwere dependencies of Belize. The merits of this case depend upon whethcr thewarswitliSpain subsequenttothetreaties with her and the severance of her colonies from her fieed the action of Great Britain in that quarter, and also on whether Ruatan and Bonaca were dependencies of Belize, or dependencies of the State of Honduras, .and thereby attached to Central America. The first point, however, does not concern the United States, but Spain. WVith respect to the second, Ruatan and Bonaca were claimed by Great Britain as belonging to Belize prior to 1850. There may be a question-it is an intricate point-as to her title. But, at all events, we see that, although the convention of 1850 is brought forward in these controversies, there is not one of the disputed cases which properly belongs to it. The renewal of the protectorate over lMosquito by Great Britain long preceded it. The engagement not to occupy, fortify, colonize, or take poss tion of Tlosquito, I was given in these words previous to the treaty, as well as in the treaty itself. The extension of Belize, the occupation of Ruatan and Bonaca are wholly distinct from it. No evil has, consequently, attended it which would not othelrwse have come to pass; and it has only failed in accomplishing .all it was intended to accomplish, because there is no treaty which cannot be contested when there is a disposition to do so, and that the dispositioni of the United States is very different now from that which it was when the treaty was concluded. WTe shall add no miore to this already somewhat lengthy analysis, except by winnowving, before we conclude, the corn from the chaff, and setting clear from diplomatic papers on the one side, and party bluster and personal capital-m.aking on the other, the ground on which .any quarrel between Great Britain and the United States can, as far as Central America is concerned, be based. *Ve must presiune that no sucI quarrel can be set up on the questioni of Belize, because on this ground the United States could have quarrelled with Great Britain at.any period during the last 30 years. It can hardly be our protection of the poor Mfosquito Indians wlich will fiurnish a pretext; for we have stipulated that we .are to obtain no benefit from protecting them, and have declared that we are anxious to find, in conjunction with the United States, some other means for thenr protection. As to Greytown, it is now occupied by settlers chiefly from the Ulnited States, who are forming themselves into a prosperous commnunity, tand only desire to be protected from their own bucaniering countrymen. The one question therefore, at practical issue relates to the two islands, which, if the two Governments cannot settle among themselves. might ba settled by an umpire, who would in half an hour easily decide as to whether they are really dependencies of our settlement or of Spanish Honduras.
PHENONIENA OF A "fRusH" TO THE DhosLNGs.- Within a week we have heard from reliable witnesses great accounts of the rush to the new diggings at Fiery-creek. This rush probably far exceeds any that has occurred since the gold discoveries. At Bendigo, indeed, when that remarkable gold(ield was opened, the yield in proportion to the population was iuch greater; and probably, also, hi proportion to the comparatively small numbers engaged inl mining yursuits. the excitement of that discovery far exceeded t sat attendin g the rush to Fiery-creek. But in poinlt of numubers Fiery-creekthrows allprevious movements of the kind into the shade, that to Biaryborough not excepted. The character of a "rush" in neodern times is, however, what we chiefly desire to draw attention to. It isnsot the helter-skelter migration of a number of diggers, carrying with them in drays, in wheelbarrows, and on their backs, the tools of their calling, their flinsy canvass dwvellings, and their supplies of food. A modemn rusl is the movement of a society. Though the spot to whiclh the digger goes was an uninhabited portion of the bush up to the time of the rush, he knows that the same motive that takes him thither will take thither also the followers of aU trades and professions, and tisat w ithin a few days he will be in a city to al intents and piuposes. He need no longer trouble himself to calculate what wvill be his wants-hundreds of eager traders will do that for hins, and, as lie pitches IiS tent, they pitch theirs; and, if he but poscsess that magic talisman of pounds, shillings, and pence, liecan buy all lee requires as readily as if ho were in Collinsstreet. Down to the iinutnote and most fantastic requirements to which private enterprise ministers, a complete and thorough cominsissariat provides al that the dig,ing army needs, and, vith indomitahle energy and perseverance, determines to keep pace with the general march. In such expeditions we find no stoppage of aU supplies at Balaklava, while the army is working in the trenches before Sebastopol. No I official blunderers disseminate green coffee, and forget to supply roasters and iiiills. Clothing does not rot in ir-constructed depots,while the soldiers shiver blanketless and out-at-elbows a few miles off. Seven miles of boggy road would be laughed to scorn as a cause of scarcity; and hundreds of caterers tax their wiits to conceive aied forestal every want. Creeks may be flooded and roads knee-deep in mud, but muider the strong stimulus of conmmercial coiepetition, such obstacles are derided, and where the. diggers go the thoroughly efficient commissariat will make its way. It is not merely the necessaries of life that are so furnished-not merely the ordinary luxuries of eatables and drinkables, but all those far-fetched and complicated wants that trade creates in order that it nay supply. The rush that brings storekeepers and their cunous museums together, brings actors, and doctors, and dancers, and lawyers, and acrobats, and conjurors, andmusicians; Tninisterstoloxu.r,minsterstohealth ministers to amusement, ministers to vice. The digger who reaches the new scene of activity a week after it ceased to be an uninhabited mountain range or plain, can breakfast at a ceffeehouse, dine at an inn, and go to the theatre in the evening. The Wzard Jacobs, we learn, has a theatre already erecting for him at Fiery-creeh, but the most rapid cf Ihis transformations is nothing to that which thus in a week converts the wilderness into a city, and gvathers together, under canvass roofs, all the component ortions of a complete community, where every man plays his part, ad where division of labour is carried out almost ascompletely as in London or Paris.-McZbouruc Argis, Oetober2B BARso3f NI&Auocr-We read ic a letter from Turin:-" The celebrated sculptor, Baron harochetti,has been here for some days, for the purpose of conferrng with our Government npon the project of erecting a monunent to King Charles Albert.

THE 1t CB !35BGOTIATIONS. -- g!EETING M ST. MA-RTTWflTATT x csterday, at 2 o'clock, a public meeting of the inhabittnts of Westminster was hel at St. Martin's-hall, Long-acre, " to protest against the conclusion of any peace on terms inconsistent with the honour and dignity of this country." The audience, which was so large as to fill every available part of the hall, was chiefly composed of tradesmen and artizans. Th ekers were not men of any political note, but the proce - gs, as wil be seen, were interestingamong other respects-from the extravagant language used by some of them, the belligerent feeling on,the part of the meoting, and a resolution which was carried by a Chartist diversion, and in deliance of the object for which tLe meeting was caled, for impeaching the present Ministry. Mr. Charles Westerton, whose name was so recently identified with the dispute between the incumbent and the churchwardens of St. Barnabas, was called to the chair. A letterwas read from General Sir De Lacy Evans, in reply to an invitation to atend the meeting, stating that he most cordiallp concurred in the protest for which it was called, and that no one would be more desirous than ho to give effect to an expression of public opinion deprecatory of so dishonourable a policy as the concluding a peace on terms inconsistent with the honour nd dignlity of the country;- but as it would be his duty to express his sentiments in the House of Commons toie-row (this day) on the subject, he did not think it would contribute to any useful purpose to speak also at the meeting in St. Mtartin's-hall. The CHAmSCARZ said that he and those who had acted with him in convening the meeting felt that a crisis of the Ereate$ possible imminence was at hand, and that the conclusion of a "peace at any price" was not in accordance with the feelings of the great bulk of the Englishlpeople. (Cheers.) They considered it was necessary at this moment that some such declaration of opinion as that should be emphatically made, anld that in caling a. meeting for that purpose they were but discharging their daty as citizens of this great country. They had seen one of the bravest armies that ever fought in the interest or defence of tlds country decimated by neglect and mismanagement, the rtumrn of two fleets from the Baltic attended w%ith little success, and the public debt enormously increased * yet they were as niuch as ever prepared to support the Government in carrying on the war to a successful conclusion, or, at all events, until the object for which it was undertaken was accomplished. They felt it their duty to make that determination known in the face of the whole world, and that they -were prepared to suffer any amount of privation in carrying it out. (Cheers.) The Hon. CnAsess S:eYTH VEREIMR moved thI first and only resolution - "That it is the opinion of this meeting that to conclude an armistice until the preliminaries of peace are signed would be at variance with the initerests and wishes of the British people, and that they consider iio treaty will be satisfactory which does not secure to the alies an indemnity for the expenses of the war, and wvhich does not guarantee the integrity and independence of the Turkish empire." He said, he felt at a tune like the present, when it was above all other considelations necessary to secure the honour and independence of the coiutry, that there vwas a neutral ground on which politicians of all classes might iserge their differences forthe attainment of that great end in wvhich they and the people at large had a connuon interest. The object of tle meeting was to protest against the conclusion of a peace on dishonourable terns, wvhich would deprive England of the proud position she had hitherto occupied among the nations of the earth. He iust saythe articles of negotiation, as they stood at present, were vague and unsatisfactory.(Hear.) Thefifth, for instance, might betaken tomean anytlhin" or nothing. It left everything in the hands of those who were carrynm on the negotiations. It would have been a more nasly and straightforvard course to dravw p in terms every stipulation that was sought to be introduced, to present that to Russia as our u&ivisaturm, and then to ask her simply to accept or reject it. (Cheers.) It was scarcely fide- to keep the people of this country in thle dark as to the meaning of tle fifth article. Ror- was the object of the fourth point, relating to naval arsenals in the Black Sea, sufficiently expressed. As it stood at present, Russia might conltinue her fortifications in the llJack Sea, amid thus keep up a standing menace against 2 ne-key. Re could see nothing in the negotiations wvhich would prevent Sehastopol from being rebuilt. Surely that could never be permitted. Again, they did not know whether 'icsolaieff was to be maintained as a fortified post as also she chain of forts on thse Circassian coasts. He thought lhe integrity of Circasia should be strictly preserved, and 1liat her gallant mountaineers ought not to be given vp to the tender mercies of Russia. (Hear, hear.) They had heard a great deal about an armistice, but he felt that any cessation of hostilities before the preliminaries of peace wvere signed would be highlyl detrimental to the best interests of te country. The resolutioin lie had moved refered also to the question of an indemnity. iHe thought the opinion of the meeting would be unanineous that the allies should he indemnified for the expenses of the war, seCeig it was one of aggression on the part of Russia. (Cheers.) Mfr. A B. Recu.mnrus said, he would second the resolution because his heart was in it, and because this was a time which should make even the dumnb speak and an ordinary man eloquenit. WVe had had a sham w. ar (loud cheers); we had had a sham blockade; and now we wvere drifting into a shanepeace. (Renewed celsers.) The organs of thc Govensinest nowv talked of peace, but theymiiight take hisword tbatthe people -were iiot likely to get it; they w-ere only to be fooled and humbugged once more. From the beginning of the existing struggle we never deelared war according to the andient custom of tlhis country. Wge had talked aU along 'about the independence of Turkey, and nowv we were going completely to destroy that independence. Through the initer-vention of tle telegraph we had, during tle war, held, as it were, a loose halter around the neck of Turkey and her brave general, Omar Pasha. 'We had done the same -with our own gallant army, for after -we gained a success we never made any use of it. Of the truts of that let time disaster of Sinope and the fall gof ars bear witness. The country had been aU along entirely in the dark as to the power which controlled the operations of tIme allies, and they were still without exact know,-ledge. Thley only knew that they were drifting into a miserable and de,rading peace. (Cheers.) He hoped that every man in tie incemting would determine to know the truth, that the English nl.ation would righlt itself if it had io trust in its Parhiasent or its MEnisters, and that if some great State criinal wvas answverable for the mismanagement of the war and the negotiations for peace they would resolve to know ivlio he was. (Cheers.) MYajor LyoN, in speaking to the resolution, contenided, in opposition to Mr. Bright, that the war was undertaken for themaintenance of the freedom of Turkey, and that, in p pit of all the rhlodoinontade of the hon. umeimber for Manchester, we ought as Englishmen and as men of sense, to carry it on toa satisfactory conclusion. (Hear, hear.) It was gratifying to think that, in the press and the tone of public feeling in this cotuntry, there was a rod in pickle for that gentleman by whiel he would be nsade to smart for some tiinse to comea. (A laugh.) He w.ished it to be felt and understood, vhen Parliament assembled tlis day, that, uiiless something was done to prevent it by the representatives of the large constituencies of this country, we should drift into an inglorious peace. This great strtggle witli Russia must be fought out, and he was glad to find the meeting so keenly alive to its inmportance. He had lately returned from the East, and it was his conviction, fromn what had come under his notice, that our aney had been beaten, not by the Russians, but by our own Administration. Through ignorance, if not in treachery, that army had been allowed to starve; and that was the doing of the friends of Russia in this country, who had been kicked out of power. Turkev, he contended, would have fought better alone than w-ith our assistance. In support of that, assertion he would relate a conversation which took place between a friend of his, an Englishman in a position of command in the Turkish squadron, previous to the disasterof Sinope, andLordStratforddoRedeliffe. On that occasion Lord Redeliffe reminded Iiim that he was onlv lent to the Turldsh service, and ordered hemi not to go into the Black Sea. " Am I then, my Lord (said the gentleman in question) to wear a man's uniform, to eat his broad, and take his pay, and not to figlt for him ? No, nsy Lord, you nmay do as you please, but go I vill," and he did go. The truth was, that Lord Redcliffe was a Russian, and not an English Ansbassador. (Cheers.) It was equally true that Russia was no longer able to maintain the wvar, and therefore she sued for peace. Russia had always gained by peace and lost by wvar, and the best policy for us was, now that we had gonme to wal, to fight it out. (Cheers.) Mr. Jnmxs Esmuis, a Chartist, moved as an amendment, "That this meeting has no hope that an indemnity for the expenses of the war will be exacted from Russia, or that terms of peace which England ought to accept 1vill be agreed on, sinless the Ministers who have entered upon the present negotiations are deprived of office and inmpeached." (Cheers and uproar.) When this country was p laced in so critical a position as the present-when her honour and her martial fame were both exposed to jeopardy-Ise thonght the time had cosiC when England should speak out. (Cheers.) He contended that the existing Government did not represent the chivalrous people of En-land by whom -the war had been carried on, and that tney ought by the common acelaim of the country to be impeached. (Cheers and uproar.) There would be a great peace meeting in St. Stephen's to-morrow, but the present -was a great war meeting to all intents and purposes, and let them by their nnimity declare, in anticipation of to-morrow's peace meeting, that any policy short of that which would diminish and humiliate the power of Russia and protect the integrity of Turkey, was antagonistic to the aspiratons of the British people, and would justify a demnand for impeachment. M1r. Hiua seconded the amendment. He contended that me ictnirs were now acting in total disregard of the great object for which the war was begun and maintained, aisd treason wasthe only word which would fitlycharacterize their conduct. "Shall the pople (he ask-ed) who once took a king into open court, tried imi before his countey, dragged bim to the bfock, and rolled his Ilead on the scaffold, shrink fiom doing justice on M1inisters? (Cheers and uproar.) 'Ihis is the anniversary of the day when that spectacle was cffered to the world in this city, and let it at least ba a worthy anniversary of it. Standing in the presence of centuries, in which the power of England has mightily increased, let us at least say we aro tho sons of cur ancestors, mid that wrewill not shrink from caing crime erime,wshether it be committed from the throne of the princ&~ or the hut of the peasant. A nd whenever that verdict was found sentence and execution shall follow," (Cheers and hisses.) The speak-er proceeded to charge Lord Palmerston with betraying Poland, Hungary, and Circassia, and with confiscating Cracow. Recognized as a trickster, he added, despised asaishuffier,andhatedasatutncoat, the Premier had been elevated into power bythepowerlesmess of every other uman, and now that one man, having gathered the whole nation into a net, was about to sacrifice the ally of England and to betray his country. (Cheers and derisive laughter.) The meeting was also addressed by Mr. S. RolLand, Mr. James Cobbett, Me-. W. 3. O'Connell, and MIr. laYwrence. and eventuallythe amendment of Mr. Pinon was put and carried by a large majority. The proceedings which lasted several heurs, then terminated.i
-T.E ALLEGED POISOVING CASE AT . JANCHESTEB. The farther examination of James Monaghan and George Barry on the charge of administering acetate of lead to the hte John T3mohtan, who died on the 11th of ugust last, was resmed beore Mfr. Maude and a numerous bench of magistrates at Manchester yesterday. 3Mr. Bradlaugh, for the proeecution, stated that be had applied to have Dlwn brought up from gaol, but the Secretary of State had not yet replied to bis letter. He then recalled Mr. Holland, surgeon. Thomas Bull Holland, surgeon, who had been examined at great length on a former hearig, said-I -afit became aequited with Edw.ard Dunn in the mouth of Miay last, and James MWonaghan I knew during the three months previous to his father's death, in May, June, and Julg last. I remember it w3s in May, because that was the firsttime I aW him, and because it was the mont in which I became acquainted with the Diadem Assurance Companv. I was then residing at 99, Green-gate, Salford, and I removed frona 99 about the first week in July. It was about five or six weeks before I removed that James Monaghan came to my house. He came with Edward Dunn. I had never seen him before. He was introduced by Dunn. It was on the Saturday before Whitsuntide races. It was on the Saturday week before. On further reflection, it was not on the Saturday week before, but on the Saturday before Whitsuntide. On that occasion Edward Dunn, his wife, his wife's mother,James Monaghan,awoman, and myself, wentto the Rlollapublichouse, inCollier-street,Broughton-road,together. Nothing of any importance was then said. During the Wednesday or Thursday in the race week I saw James M1onaghan argain when Mary Monaghan amd Edward Dunn andh eallen upon me, and we again went to the Rolla. Dunn then said something about the insurance on his father's life, and James Monaghan was present and could hear what was said. James lonaghan acquiesced in what Dunn said. He said, "Yes, we have ; " butI do not recollect Dunn's exact words. After that James Monaghan said nothing to me, nor did Dunnn The next time I saw James 'Ionaghan I think wa after his father's death I saw him three times before Monaghan's death, but I do not remember whether Tuesday, the '5th of June, was one of those days. The first time I learned that old Monaghan's life was insured was the second time we went to the Rolla. I heard James Monaghan and Dunn speaking of it then. I heard the two speaking in conversation to,gether that John Monaghan's life had been insured by his son. I asked who passed hibn, and Dlunn said that Mr. Orr had passed him. Notldng that I remember was said on this occasion about their going " whacks' (or sham es) in the proceeds of the insurance, but that was said by them after old Monaghan's death. I first made the acquaintance of Barry by calling with Dunn upon him one evening, w%hen we went to the Shp publichouse together, in StrndehilL It was about 7 o'clock, and the gas was lighted. A little conversation took place about Mona;han's death, and it was said that the money should be divided among themn when they got it. Barry, Dunn, and James MIonaghan took part in the conversation. One of them remarked that the three had joined in the premium, and when the money was got from the insurance company it would be divided between them. I have heard Barry state that he signed the referee paper for Monaghan-the friendly referee paper as to the health of old John Monaghan. That was after the old man's death. Barry did not caU on ine on the first Sunday after I removed to 101, Greengate, nor yet did Dunn. I do not rememnber James Monaghan calling upon inc on a Sunday about the middle of July. It was the latter part of the year that I mixed the sugar of lead lotion of which I have before spoken, and not in June or .July. In the first week in Aug,ust I saw Dun but it was net in the presenc of Barry or Mfonaghan. I do not remember if I saw Dunn and James Monaghan on the 5th of Augfust, nor in the early part of August, but I did in the latter part of Augulst. James .Monaghan never told me his father was very ilL. It was after his father's death he said the insurance company would have to pay 3001., but never before. I believe this was three or four weeks after old Mtonaghans death. That was at my own house, when he and Dunn had called together. He said his fatlher was dead. I asked what he died of, andhe replied "It is stated -dysentery." Sugar of lead was not mentioned on that occasion. Mr. Bradlaugh here said,-I relinquish any further examination of this witness. M1r. Feniley cross-examined the witness, whose attention he caUed to a former examination, when he said he mixed a lotion containing acetate of lead. He now said,-he only mixed one lotion, and that was after old Monaghan's death. I myself wvas taken into custody on this charge by Mr. Superintendent Lcary and MSr. Bradlaugh. I was taken from the Albion. Acetate of lead was often given to the poor for diarrhoia or cholera. Re-examined by Yr. Bradlau"h.-The carbonate of soda and sugar of lead vwere Put in v isky, at the time referred to, at the suggestion of Dun Matthew liale said,-I reside in Collier-street, Salford, and keep the Belle publichonse. I know the last witness (Holland), andlmve seen the prisoner James Monaghan at my house. I saw the prisoners .on.ghan, Dunn, andHolland at my house on the Saturday before WYhit-Sunday. There were several wvomen wvith them. On the following Wednesday I saw James Monaghan, Dunn, andHolland together at my house. I remember the day, because I Was dressing for the races, and went to serve them with porter, in my shirt sleeves. I know it was not the autumn races, because I did not go to the autumn meeting. I saw Dann, ANonaglian, and Holland on several occasions, but the next time that Iparticularlypaidattentionto them wason thefirst Saturday in August, which 1 believe was the 4th. They were at my house for some hours, when I heard both Monaghan and Dunnm invite Hollandto dine withthem on the following day. They appearedto be very p resingthat he should come, and stated that there would be plenty of whisky. They also said if he did not come they wonld fetch Im They came afterwards. The others never caine except with Holland, or when they sent for him. They came so often .aS to excite attention, and were called " Borter and Com- pany." Bhsabeth Talson said,-I reside with nily brother, Thomas Bull Hollaid, and knowv Edward Dunn. I saw himu at 99, Greengate, before June last. I recollect Monaghian calling with Dunn at the latter end of July. I took his address down in the book produced. He said Mr. Holland was wanted to go and see his father who was ilL Dunn was with hin. I next saw James Monaghan when he came with some one to be insured, about the time of the Autimn races. When James Monaghan called in July it was late in the evening. Francis King, sworn.-I am the son-in-law of the late John Monaghan, and reside at .3, Mount-place, Brookstreet. When old Monaghan was alive I resided at 11, Hope-street, Charlton, and he resided with me for four or five years before his death. I and my wife were on friendly tornus with him. James Monaghan never told ume during his father's lifetime about the insurance of his father's life. Never heard him say anything in 3av or June about it, or about a third insurance with the Diadem Company. Never heard of any insurance upon the old man until after his death. Never remnember the prisoner Barry visiting my father-in-law. Wihen he died my wnfe, miyself, and James Monaghan attended upon him. The first time I saw Daun was when Dunn and James Monaghan called with the agent of some life insurance company, who w.ished him to insure his life. Monaghlan asked the agent if he would insure an old man who was ill lik-o him, and he said, "Yes he would, for a small sum." The old man declined bepause he was ilL I recollect Dnnn and Monaghan going to see the old main when he was ill. They afterwards came into my room, and I learnt from them that they had been to see the old man. One of themn said the old man had had a glass of whisky. I said it was wrong to have given it to him, and against the doctor's instructions. Janies Monaghan bad not called to see his father much untll the last few days of his life, when he was there aimost constantly. M3yself and wife had gone to rest a short time before the old man's death, and James Monaghan came to say he was dying. He only lived a minute or tvo after we got to him. I never heard James speak to his father or his father to James, during his last illness, about his life being insureL. I saw a coffin opened in St. Wilfred's graveyard the other day, and the body contained therein was that of my Late father-in-Law. The prisoners were soon afterwards remanded. In counexion with the above case, Mr. Bradlaughi had previously orought a charge against two men named Tcrence M'Laughlin and James Keefe of having forged a w%ill, piwrportingto he thewill of the LateJohm Monaghan. Mr.Fernley, barrister, appeared on behalf of the prisoners, and objected to th right of Mr. Bradlaugh to conduct a case of this hind; but the objection was overruled by Mn. Mande; the ease was only brought forward to establish evidence wvhich would justify a remind. Francis King said,-I am the son-in-law of the late Johm Monaghan, and he resided vith me at the time of his death, and four or five years previously. The pape r roduced iS my writing. I wrote it before Monaghan s ueath about afortnightlefore. The mark at the back was made by John Monaghan. It purports to be a will of Mona-ghan. Monaghan died on a Saturday morning, in Auiguist last, at 2 o'clock. I had the paper in my hand, after his death, and there were then no pencil marks on it, hut there are now. I wrote the body of the document, but did not see Monaghan sign it. I sawv the paper after John Monaghan's death, and it had not then the pencil marks which I now see upon it. I knolv the prisoner M'Laughin by sight, and remember seeing him three weeks after Ionaghan died. That was at my late residence Hope-street. James Mlonagban and lMchael O'Nbeil were present. 'Laughli then signed the wilL Mr. Femuley objected to the evidence unless the paper or will itself was prodneed. MUr. Bradlaugh would then apply for a remand until he could obtain the original wvill fromn Chester. The nagistrates thought that the further examination of this witness might be postponed untll another day, but they wrished other evidence to be taken. Inspector Thomas Anderton, of the police, said,-The prisoners were given into my charge this mornig, about halfpast 12 o'clock. 31Laughlin was brcught separately charged Vith being concerned in the forgery of a will-the will said to be forged was that of the late John Mona. ghan-and with being the accessory after the fact to various other felonies, committed by James Monaghan and others. I took the charge, and cautioned him that he need not commit himself by making any statement. He replied, "1 I have nothing to say- I have no reply to make.' About halfpast 1 o'clock i received James Kefe in charge. He was charged with the like offence, with the addition of that of perjury. I also cautioned him in like manner. He said, Ifts a lie. I was sittinginFrank King'shouse, who lived next street to me; the old man John Monaghan was lying il in bed, and they called me out to see him sign his'name to a wilL They hadto support him. He tried to xvrite his name, but could not and he put a cross. They then called me to put my name as a witness, and I did so. There were present John Monaghanis own daughter, son, and sonin-law.' I asked him how long that was before the old man's death; but he could notte, orexactly tell. By Mr. Fernley.-I put down all that took placo ile a jmocketbook at the time, except the question I asked him, or the answer. Ho made the statement voluntarily, and I asked So question except the one mentioned at the close of my exanunation, There was present at the time, besides M. Bradlaugb, a gentleman mow in court. [Hr. BradluglZ maid, the person present was William Monaghan, son of the deceased.] I do not know that William Monaghan ws one of the 2fianchester police force. The case Wus remanded until Mfonday zixt, to give time for the production of the original will from Chesttr, and for other evidence.
SIR E. LYO;S. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TDS. Sir,-Any one who, having belonged to the Black Se; leet, readsyour article upon Sir Edmund Lyons in 27; 'mcs of to-day, must do so with mingled feelngs of pleasure and pain,-pleasure, that you have so justly paiwe& in msanly, earnest, yet unflattering terms, the only Admiral Commanding-in-Chief who has by energy and dash upheld our naval renown during this war; but pain at the reflexions cast upon his fleet by the concluding portion of the same article. Touching upon the sufferings of the army in the trenches during the siege of Sebastopol you say, " Daring the whole of this gloomy season the navy waS but a spectator," &c., and you then draw a comparison betwveen the sufferings and labours of the two services, and leave it, I believe, to be inferred that those wants and those hardships which pressed so sadly upon the soldiers might have been alleviated by a more active sympathy upon the part of the sailor. Surely you cannot have said this, and have been aware ef what the navy didfor the army in the Crimea? The modesty of Sir Edmund Lyons and the death of tho generous-hearted Lord Raglan will, perhaps, prevent it ever being known to what an extent that assistance was carried ; nor would any naval officer touch upon it but for the purpose of shielding his chief and his profession from a chargewhichinvolveswantof zeal and want of common humanity. It istrne,thesailororofficerof theBlack Seafleet,thoUgh, perhaps, he might have seen that his nearest and dearest friend in the sister service was sinking under his sufferings, could not go and take his place in the camp- but they did what they could, by sharing their stores, public or private, by extending their hospitality, even beyond their slender means, and by uan active sympathy, which few in the army Will deny. You have forgotten, Sir, that during that long and trying winter the British fleet lay watching a port within which 15 sail of the enemy's fleetstill rode;tlle winter's gale which chilled the blood of the English sentry upon his post pinched not the less the English seaman on his look-out in one of Her Mlajesty's ships plunging through the rollers of the Black Sea; the wettings and freezings endured in the boats of the Black Sea fleet fell little short of the trenches; and, as far as fair hard work goes, I question whether Jaclk had not the most of it, though he always had a dry roof to go to when that work was done. You had no correspondent afloat in the fleet, no "Russell" to tell of their unobtrasive labours or the onerous responsibilities of their Commander-in-Clsief. Sir Edmund Lyons had to look not only to the efficiency of his Black Sea fleet, and to be prepared -with it, singlehanded, to fight the Russian one, because, with the exception of the Napoleon, the French line-of-battle ships had been disanred and turned into trausports; but our admiral was, You will remember, Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean likewise. His anxieties and correspondence, the calls upon his time and foresight, referred not to the Crimea alone; he had British interests in Egypt and Greece, Syria and Naples to look to. Ten thousand seamen actually afloat had to be fed and clothed; stores for a large fleet (many of them steamers) to bring from Malta and elsewhiere; provisions and stores for 50,000 British soldiers to be landed, and this was aiways done faster than the army could receive them; the Turks, under Omar Pasha, at Enpatoria, 30,000 strong, to be supported and provisioned; the Sardinian troops to bring to the front; a rigorous blockade of Kertch Straits and the Circassian coast to be enforced, as well as that of the Danube, Dneister, and Dnieper; and, besides all this, order, discipline, and health to be preserved in a fleet num berig some hundred pendants; and yet you say "the fleet was driven to extremity to find -work for its crews." The Seamen's Brigade, it is true, passed the -winter, which told so much upon other artillerynen, in comparative freedosn from disease. Out of 1,400 men, their general average, the anxrimnusts sick list was 60 men, and they often had only 14 ill at a time. Surely, it is unfair to impute this purely to their provisions being drawn from a man-of. war instead of as the army did from transports. Did not their superior organization deserve some praise? The fore. sight of their superiors in demanding provisions and clothing before they were hungry or naked, and the zeal of the subordinates in entering into the details of their dulrties, and procruing -hat thoy were ordered to fetch to the front,surely this was their doing, and it was not the fauit of Sir Edmund Lyons or his fleet that all the army did not do likewise. Admural Boxer, Captain Cospatrick Hamilton, Captai Osborn, Commander Campion, and Lieutenant Hawkins, were all of f.hem for months employed solely attending to the discharging of transports and the placing upai the beach of Balaklava the food andstores of that axny. Ask themn the rank of the officer of the sister service who was ever seen to interest himself upon so important service; and ask them of the amount of zeal and intelligence exhibited by these who were sent down from the front to carry up such provisions said stores? Ask lMajor, now Colonel Anderson, who gave himnthe most effectual aid in Landing his ordnance stores, and arranging them? WVhy, Sir, every article used in the British camp was landed by the seamen of Eer MaIesty's fleet, and it Was not from want of goodwill thats they did not further help those who seemed so incapa6ble of helping themselves. The picked sailors of the fleet manned the advauced g.us agailst Sebastopol; the majority of the marines fromn the ships were brigaded as a guard on the heights of Balaklava. In that port the crews of four men-of-war were employed constantly discharging transports; another squadron were doing as much at Eupatoria under Captain Hastings, and the Rodney, with strong working parties, did likewise in. Kazatch-bay. Not a yard of canvas, not a fathom of rope, bolt of flannel, or bale of slops,-in short, store or provision of any description was in the fleet but what was. put at the free disposal of the British army; and, could the resources of the fleet have averted the misery and disorganization of the troops, or the break-down of the commnissariat, it would have been done. A return, if necessary, colda be shown of -what eaeh shi>p in that fleet contributed in men, labour, and ;a7srtsfZ,-k toward the comfort and success of the Crimean army, and it would at least exonerate them from the charge of the want of active co-operation. A thousand articles occur to me. Ask the cavalry -who made them many hundred nosebags for horses?-the engrincers about the rope mantelets for their batteries-the Transport Corps about the canvas saddlebags for taking shot to the front-the artillery about some 40,0D flannel cartridges made by us-the Commissariat of 120,Olb. of salt meat given them one fine morningby Sir Edamud Lyons, when they suddenly found theirstcek was expanded. All this, and much more, was done; bat I wi3I tell you what we did not do. We did not disable the whole3 fleet by taking out their guns and giving them to the artiL lerymen when they discovered that cities in 1I835 were not as easily takeen as Badajoz. About a third only of the fleet was dismantlcd or rather disabled-the Rodney, Albion, Queen, Leander, Diamond, Wasp, &c. ; the others were kept readyto cover the exposed face of the left French attack, or fight the Russians if they came out. The discipline of our navy was not subverted, or its spirit as a profession sub_ verted, by being turned into a Sea Transport Corps; and if you coudd only, as I have done, seen the effect of such a system in the once fine navy of France, you would, ike me, than]k God that, as a nation dependent upon the command of the sea for our liberty and existence, we have avoided sBO fatal a step. You compare us with the navy of our present ally. We Vwll all gladly accept your compariscon-the further yen wil be pleased to carry it the better-and they know best whother if peace comes to-morrow Her Majesty's navy has fallen aught in their estimation, or which they would' soonest have us as-friend or foe. A BLACK SEA NAVAL OFFICER. 31aidstone, Jan. 30.
