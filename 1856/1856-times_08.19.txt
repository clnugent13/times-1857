The decision on the Rig:I Railway question by *the Committee of the Stock-Exchange this afternodn was unfavoarable,; it not- beiig considered that the official documents pledg e the uian Government to the tarsus held out in th e Moapectu. The Com4 -nittee have accordingy decided that the shares shall be omitted from the officiallist until the actual conditions contemplated at St. Petersburg allbkecome lmown. Meanwhile it is understood the - direetor persist in the belief that their prospectus exDressed the general intentions of the Government, iand tha these intentions will still be carried out. The fact that the terms were circulated for three or fouri months all over E urope, and especially in Hollaudq the chief market for Russian securities, without a -word of caution being officialy given, woild un. doubtedly support that conclusion; and the announcement that Russia. is about to concede other 3ines, with a guaaintee of 5 per cent., tends in the -same direction. It is understood, moreover, -that the Riga and Dunaburg Railway is certain -to be constructed.; and it is urged, that ss the subscriptions of the public in London and Amsterdam, whatever may have beein the miatakes of the directors were unquestion,. ably made in good faith, they may be regarded.as fairly entitled to a sort of pre-emption in any new -concession in case the present one should be set aside. The resolution of the Stock-Exchange Committee was to the following effect, and it merely --waits confiriation at another meeting to be held -on Wednesday:_ - "The Committee, after having attentively perased the ukase of the late Emperor of Ruzsia, and other documentÂ§ 23id before them by the directors of the Ri a and Danaburg Raiway Company, and having len;dr the statements of tho6e gentlemen and of their solicitor, are of opinior, that the terms held out in-the prospectus are not in conformity ith that uisze, and it is therefore tesolved thbt the shares of the Riga and Danabhrg RIailay be for the present rmitted from the off cial lisft4" - - The reports from the -manufacturing towns foi the past week coutinue to indicate a steady trade at Snn pricesw with a general absence of excitement or speculation, - At kManchester-the market remaMns inactive, but: stocks are low-an-dquotations well sup!. ported. -The Birmingham advces-mention only a sIight tendency to recovery in manufactured iron' but the general trades of the place show an improved home and foreign demand. At Nbttingham there is increased confidence,: owing to the harvest at home and good accounts f rom Australia and Ae- ica. In the woollen ditricts there has been no alteration, ancd in the Irish linen-markets there has been a full business at former rates. The following relates to a grievance connected with the arrangements of the offlce of the Ac. countant-General in Bankruptcywhich has often beenr a subject of complaint. It may be assumed that by a.:little manag,ement a remedy maight be adopted withou1t dimninishing the annuail amount of relaxation, at present enjoyed by tlhe officer3 concerned: "Sir.-On the Ist of Angust i attended a meeting at tho Court of Bankruptcy here to declare a dividend from an estate, and, althou3h the funds are in the Bank of Enzland waiting this division, and not bearing interest, I fnTd that in consequence of the holydays in the Accountant-General I in Ba.rulptcy's office the dividend cannot be paid until the -st 7eek an Ootober.

"Liverpool, Aug. 14. The prospectus has been issued of the National Eavmnas Bank Association, with a capital of 10,0001., to be increased to ]00,0001. - The object is to create an independent savings-bank, presenting security of a more tangible nature, combinedl ith greater freedom of action, than is possible under the e2isting system. The result of savings-banks on the charitable orpaternal sytem has been a heavy loss to the Government, while the depositors have also suffered, since 22 have failecl for an aggregate amount of 150,0001. Yet the rate of interest allowed is at the highest only 31. Os. 100. per cent.; in the maIority of cnaesit is far below that smm; andthere wre at present 483 places, with more than 3,000 inhabitants, without a svingabanh. Moreover, out of 485 savings-banks in eisence there are onlyfour in which the depostors have the responsibity of f-he managers and trustees as a protection. In all the others these parties have declined to assumeany personal liability, and in no case is there any sibscribedccapital to fall back lpon. The promotefs of the proposed association believe that, adoptingthe ordinary rules of busines, they could remedy these defects, pay at least 34 per cent. to their depositors, and secure a remunerative profit for their shareholders. They are encouraged by severgi prudent and philanthropic persons and, whether they succeed or otherwise, there ca ie no question that, sooneror later, the sysem of Government meddling with the bakn' afair of the humbler classes will be recognizea as an anomaly that shoull be discontinued. - The Lands Improvement Company have -held 1hehz third annualme&ine, and the accounts presented for 1853 were -considered satisfactory, the second year of the company's operations having re*ulted in a small balance of profit after payment of er,tabizshment and working expenses. The report showed that the directors have conducted their businems strictly on the commercial- principle rigiMally decided upon,-viz., as an agency betwedn the landowner and the Government nlcdosure Coin-' midasioners, and between the landowner and the moneyed public; and-that their contracts with land,owners for the supply-of money for improvements have been at the rate of 200,0001. a-year; the total at this time being nearly 500,0001., for which pro-vision has been duly made by contracts for the sale of the renteharges. Tha directors-iTtber anounced that, the positon of the comP4ny having thmus become established, ample profits had been realized durine the frst six months of the current year, out of which they recommended interest at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum should be paid for the year 1855 on the paid-up share capitaL A portion - of the share, capital remaining for appropriatiosi, tbh directors propoied that, -nless previously applied for. by the pronrietors, it -should be offered to the puli atar p hu e 2jbined mercantile letter from. the Rivem!

LONDON, TUESDAY, AUGUST 19,1856. a- it is curious to observe in the several epocs of a nation's history the recurrence of the same paaions under different guises, and the same attrac.tions or repulsions under different denominations. At one period the recollection of-a victorious' -ZZFession pits the representatives of the conquerors and conquered against each other in the - cosItant antagonism of race. The names of the original distinction remain long after both nations have been subjected to one sway and blended uLder one law ; and when, at Last, the distinctive appellation has become obsolete or ummeaning the division is s-till k,ept up by -the intrusion of other jeaoulies and the substitution: of other names. In- the 11th. century the-usual and popular ey of the Saxon-English wqW" D3owlWth "the Normans." [n the 14th century that cry is heard no longer; in its stead resounds the shout, "No gentleman ri and three centuries later it was,- " No more proud Lords and- rotten-.hearted " Bishops i .A:century later heard anathemas against "Hanoverian rats " and " German cormo" ranti " while the present eentur2 at different periods has listenei to outcries against Lords, Bishops, and powers -in general,. and among these powers the capitalists, the millowners, and the class of emplovers as a body. Thus, by right of descent the master- manufacturer has come to fill in the popular mind, so far as a great-change of circumstances will permit, nearly the same obnoxious place that the Norman Baron, the PIAi2TAGENET Lord, or. the STURuT Peer filled in the minds of the commonalty centuries ago. The contemplation is a curious one. It suggests not only commonplace reflections on the identity of j human nature, but also others not less striking on the mutability of clames and the-progress of individuaLs. The outcry against. capitalists and employers is a variation of the- same strain that has been sung since there were great and little, rich and poor, in the world. It is the consolation alike of oppressed poverty and querulous envy. -But the accidents which'provo7ke it --and the accompaniments which colour it are peculiar to our- age, and almost peculiar to this country. The object of the bitter complaint,- the stem remonstrance, the - cynical depreciationij -br the arbitrary combination is neither invested with the exclusive Drivileges of a fe-dal caste nor raised on the pinnacle of courtly grandeur. He is neither armed with the prestige of a dominant race nor decorated with the splendours of regal favour. HIe is just a man of the same origin, the same pefigree, the same name, and, in some cases, the - same' education, early habits5 and training, as- the men who judge him, or dislik-e him, or envy him. He is just a SETHr or a Tno3asox, a BROWNi or a JO.XES, a Wnsox or a Ps&rrsow, like the men who work -at his forge or his jenny, in his pottery or his foundry. The only difference 'between them is, that he is the-employer and they the employed. And what has caused this difference? In some cases, indeed, the accident of inheritance or bequest; buat in the majority of cases it is labour. The master has begun--life in the same condition as that of his labourers, or in a condition but slightly elevated above it. Es position is due to his industry, his economy, hiA common sense, and perhaps, iii some degree, to that good luck, a share of which invariably attends every person whose antecedent conduct and character enable him to turn favourable opportunities to-advantage. From a workman he hls become a middleman; from a middleman-a small capitalist; from a small capitalst a large one; and, finally, an employer of hundreds of his countrymen. A -man who has so risen cannot have effected his sucess - without severe 'struggles and frequent risks. Of these his workmen, of course, know nothing. Of the difficulty with which he -has amassed his capital, or of the anxiety which besets its investment, they are ignorant. They only see the outward and- visible signs of attained prosperity-the working engine, the crowded factory, and the abundant productions. Of the variations in the market-of gluts-of falling prices or failing credit-of the harassing cares which they causethe men have only an inperfect notion. They ee a man " no better than they are themselves"' enjoying, as they suppose, luxury and wealth eamred by their toil, and unembittered by solicitude; and, without reflection, they demand a larger share in th-e products of their own industry, or they threaten- that which to an employer is almost ruin-" a strike." This is one-class of-" strikes." Were it the only one, it would amply justify the re-enactment of the repealed laws against combinations. It would be intolerable that men should combine to extort from their masters an amount of wages -which the current prices or the average of profits prevented them from giving. A systematic resort to this last appeal would crush all- enterprise and destroy all capital throughout the country. It wvould, [n a very short time, raise up foreign and rival competition on the ruins of English industry. But this is not the only kind of " strike."- - As far as - the evidence given before the Commi*ttee of the Commons on Operatives and Masters goes, that class of "strike3" which is begun and continued by ignorant and envious workmen against just employers is exceptional. We are glad to encourage this belief; we are glad to believe that English worklmen do not bring the fearful alternative of a "strike" to bear againsttheir masters merely under a false impression or an ignoble envy of-the means possessed by the latter. Holding this belief, we cannot but regret that too many- employers give cause for the discontent of their workmen by their fahse economy and false pride,-false economy iwhich degenerates into meauness, and false pride -which hardens into obstinacy. - The rate of wages should never seem to depend upon the power of combinations, wlhether on the side o'f the men or their employers. It is, in fact, sooner or -later, determined ' by other laws which are more fair, and therefore more favourable to both parties, than any combinations, however alrong, can be. When trade is brisk all crafts feel the genial influence, and- the expanding field of employment opens for the mechanic a surer prospect of augmented wages than any, union could effect; when trade slaclkens the competition of unemployed worl;men and the fall of profits force a reduction of wages which no urdon can resist. In the former case it is foolish parsinony or foolish obstinacy which makes a master delay a change that circumstances -are bringing about independently of his volition ;- in the latter it is an unreasoning injustice, which seeks to effect by numbers and menace that which the state of the labour-market does not permit. Bat the former is the worse case of the two, because the master is supposed to be better educated and to understand the signs of the market better than his men; and any niggard&parimony on his part provokes a retributive combination on the part of the men. And when obstinacy in the matter of wages is generally complicated with petty acts of despotism, small meannesses, and questionable glippings, the disposition to combine evinced by illiterate wortmen, whose toil is their capital, is palliated, if not jusified. The worst of it is, thnese combinations pro;- yoke counter-combinations. If workmen may unite to force up the rate of wages when they thirk times are prosperous, what is to prevent masters from combining to lower wages when profits are tending to zero ? There is -notbing more unjust or impossibie in the latter than in the former hypothesis. To be sure, each colurse is, on grounds of public policy, dangerous and to be deprecated. Anything that -wouid prevent its occuirence or its frequency is desirable. But what will have this effect?- The witnesses before the committee say that -the men generally have a hiorror of appealing to magisterial tribunals. It implies disgrace, and we are glad to record even a prejudice which denotes self-respect on the part of the English workman. Again-and this is a more material objection-in tne districts where these disputes occur too mainy of the magistrates are master manufacturers, and, even with the best intentions, side with their own class. What is to 'e done ' inIny witnesses auggest local Boards, composed equally 'of _'workmen and employers. But-it requires verTy Ittle knowlege- 'o human nature to predict the division of opinion where the pllants: are' employer ands eimployed. 'And to whom is the ultimate appeal Two suggestions are mnade; one givs a profssional .and stipendiary Achaiman, with a'castmng vote, toÂ° the court of fi-st appeal-; another creates a second copr of appeal, conisting of cperativea and masters of .very-craft. Both these auggestions seem to us impracticable. How is a legal or lay chairman to.und astad all the details relating to the crafts of engineers, miachinists, turners, braswfotuiders, wireworkers, cutlers, calenderers, calico printers, cloth manufacturers, paper manufacturers, weavers, lace workers, glaaa workers, alkali workers,- alum workers, whee1wrights, carpenters and joiners, &c.? Anad yet he might have to give a casting .vote in disputes arismig from vexed questions on the details of these employments. -As for a court containing one representative of each of these trades, - it- would be simply u seless; We can see only "one.-solution of this difficult problem. The. lessons of education, of bitter experience, -and of a sound- conscience must teach masters and men to trmas more to the genial sygmpathies of miutual: co3ifidince and common interest than to the resources of .combination and the artllery of 'strikles." Till this happy cBhange ba effected we shall- have sad repetitions of the Preston 'strike," tens-of thousands of pounds mis. spent by the workmen, hundreds of thousands lost to them as -wages,. and iillions of profits foregone by employers, all for want.of mutual confidence and timely' conference!
It was all very w ell in one's, younger days to read Tomances about piracy, and to imagine that the proper vocation of man was to cruise about the ocean appropriating assorted cargoes, and compelling luckless mariners to walk the plank.. There are few lads of any spirit who have not passed throughl the Red Rover phase of vision, but a very brief experience of life is enough to convince all but professional -dreamers that wholesale robbery and assassination by sea or land are in our days an anachronism. It is, no doubt, quite as possible to carry on human affairs upon the basis of violence as upon the basis of peace, but not upon a confusion of the two systems. Either peace or violence mnust prevail... Now, in these modern times, despite the recent incident at Sebastopol, the miost influential nations of the world have arrived at the conclusion tlhat, save under abnormal circumstances, we are to act upon the peace theory. Nations will go -to war with each other, but no community, no man, shall go to war with all nations, or with all men. Even anong members of the same commiaity we will no longer endure I rapine, violence, and disregard of legal obligations. In our own islands the most high-spirited Irish gentlemran must now approach the subject of his tailor's bill with decent reverence, and no longer qualify that document with the epithet of " dirty," or any adjective of a depreciatory character. The heroes of the garotte are consigned to crank labour, or called upon to give temporary assistance in the construction of those public works which are calculated to maintain the maritime dominion of this empire. We send fraudulent banLers to gaol, and poisoning husbands to the gallows. In India we have' put down the practice of Thuggee, romantic and attractive to the imagination of the Hindoo as that system appears to have been. In the Chinese waters we* have blown pirates into atoms by wholesale, and sunk, burnt, or otherwise destroyed their junks. Even during hostiities between nations the principle that non-combatants are not to be visited with the extreme penalties of war either by sea or by land has now received the' sanction of well-nigh every civilized people. The- privateer is banished from the sea-are we to tolerate the presence of the professional pirate?' For a longtime past, save in the instance to which we are about to call attention, and, perhaps, in the case of the petty marine larceners of the Greek Archipelago, piracy has been unknown in Europe. When Lord Exsxourn's cannon swept the Mole of Aliers there was an end of organized piracy on the coasts of Europe. The French occupation of Algeria has, no 'doubt, contributed to . the permanence of the remslt, and so far Europe is indebted to hance for her action in Northern Africa. Despite, however, of this, to the westward of the French possessions a lawless -horde -of barbarians still maintain the traditional infamy of the North African tribes, and prey upon any' chance vessel which adverse winds or continudus calms may throw into their power. The 'iAff pirates,. for it is of them we spealk, can scarcely be said to be pirates in the old sense of the word. They do not man galleys,' collect fleets, run up the black flag, and sweep the seas in pursuit of prey. They are rather exaggeratea " wreckers" than pirates of the bad old school, ibut their devastations are not the less annoying to commerce or afflicting to huinanity. From time to time we receive accounts of the outrages which these ruffians have committed, and within the last few days intelligence has been received in this country which will, as we trust, inspirit the nations of civilized Europe to abate this deplorable nuisance once for alL On the same principle on which SIDrna SmITH used to say that we should never have security upon our railways until a Bishop,. were he only of SMnon and m -; had been boiled or squeezed to death, we are now justified in entertaining the hope that something effective will be done aggainst this scum of barbarians. They have acully attacked a Prussian Prince, and, we regret:to add, have infided upon him a severe musket wound; so that if this does imnt rouse the stateSnien of Europe to action we know I not what will. The story .in brief is' thisPrince >AALB}xMT 'of Prussia-the same, we believe, who served with, the British armies during the Sikh campaign, but: who is now High Adniral of Prussia, was criising recently about the Mediterranean in the Prussian frigate Dantsic. When off the Riff coast it was Unfortunately remembered, either by the Prince or by some of the ship's company, that they were near a spot 'where 'a Prussian vessel had been plundered some years hbefore by- the Riff pirates. The Prnce made up his minid to land at the spot in one of the ship's boats,-and to examine the scene of the.. outrage. The boafts crew had pulled --way from' under the cover-of the frigaWte's batteries, and was nearing the shore, when-a firo was opened upon them 'by the Riffs, who fired from hiding-placeso n the beach. - The Prince instantly adopted- the bravest, if not the wisest course.' He retirned to the frigate, manned. and armed her b'oats, made his men bend to their oars, and pulled in upon the beach with redoubled speed. Once landed they endeatoured to cnarge their unseen antagonists, but were taken at. a disradvantage which neutraized their superior' skill, discipline, and courage. The Riffs had the continent of Africa behind them. They were well acquainted with every rock and hidingplace along the line of coast, and of course asked no better than to draw their antagonists away from the beach and from' the protection of thefrigate's guns. It was soon ascertained that against such fearful odds nothing could be done, and the order 'was given to retreat. The Prussianss-were of course fired uponduring this procesw, and by the time they had regained their bo&ts, and got once more under the protection of the frigate's gmns, the Prince's Aide-de-Camp-his flag-ieutenant_wa.mortall woounded, and seven men were killed, and 17, mortally wounded (thrce of them were left on the field aind could not be got ofe);a mat-e wasM ottAlixougjthe,elbow - joit, an1d the Ptince him,sef received aball in-his thigh. Altogether the:affair seems 't- havebeen carned on with much pirit o des' nor is i any imputation inpon the courage, of thep Prussiau seamen that they were at length compelled to. retreat when tsakeu at- such fearful disidvanae. The resolution of Prinew ADABErnT to force a landing seems to hai beenzomewhatlightly taken. We, are at a loss to. see what result he could .ave expected even hid he, succeeded in driving his barbarous assailats from rock to rock for - a mile o 'twvo inland. Had there been a town or village of 'which,:lhe couild have taken posesion, or-hostages whom.he mig-ht hiie seized, the: case would have been different. But tc make a'rush at the coast o m mrica inhe face of a' well-armed enemy, and that- without settled_plan or means of lmaintaining7 a footing if once gained, a,ppears to be a Quixotic idea ,careely-wortny of an officer- in high connuand. .. The end of tlis Bad business is, that the Dantsic was taien back to Gibraltar, and some of the late combatants were .sent. to the niiitary hospitals, some .consigned to the earth with military honours. The Englisgh steamsloop Yesuvius- was at once despatched by. the - authorities at Gibraltar to make:. complaint of the outrage, 'dad - to - de- d redress. It' appears that there is -ome centeal authority' to which application can -be 'made 'in' such case, and this is always something g,ied. The absence of organizatio -would be the most serious obstacle :in- the way of obtaining a satisfactory result. 'Wero these Rifflans merely individual owners of long guns, each of whom was ready to murder or plunder on hiis own account, or in temporary partnership, as it might be most convenient.at the moment, it is obvious that you might hang Auour without ruffling ALfs feelings in any very serio,us 'degree. We kniw so little of the Riffian organization that we cannotpretend to point out precise methods for the repression of their abominable outrages. Our Consul at Tangier ought, however, to be prepared on the instant with all the necessary information upon this point. The French and Eiglish Governments might well umite their, efforts to repress this scandalous system. As the scene of it is not distant from the EgliBsh fortress of Gibraltar, nor from the French possessions in'Algeria, the duty of' coercion and repressionis east'upon 'us both. Piracy' and outrage upon unoffending ships should no longer be tolerated on any portion of the coasts washed by the waters of the Mediterrean.
The frightful colliery accidents which have been occurring nearly every week lately 'must have Larested every oine's attention. We need only refer now to the last two. In the first of these, in which nearly one hundred people were killed, it turned out that no substantial precaution at all had been tak3en against danger. The second was a stiU worse case of carelessness. The mine was known to be dangerous, and yet a gang of colliers, rather than take a DAvY-lamp, took a pan of hot coals; -which, of course, fired the gas, andcprodiiced an explosion that l-illed every one of them. How is this miserable folly and recklessness in the mining labourer to be cured? M. TR}m-- unsan's report, vhich is principally devoted to the question of justice as-between master and man in the mining districts, and the mode of stopping the quarrels between the -two, does not discuss this serious concomitant of mining labour, -or enter into the subject of accidents and the mode of preventing them. But the subject demands consideration, and it vill at once appear to every one who reflects at all, that there is but .one remedy for them,' and that is making the mining labourer himnself more sensitive to danger, and more careul against it. But how is this to be done? Hfere is the difficulty. Sensitiveness to sceen danger-to danger actually present and . on the spot, is a common gift enough; it is- part of our nature, and hardly, indeed, requires reason to give it; the beasts have it. But sensitiveness to priolvble danger-i. e., to danger which does not appear, and which we only know to exist by reason, as distinct from general nervousness and timidity, is far fira a common quality. It implies the habit of acting upon chnces, which is a comparatively rare habit in men, and is the mark, where it exists, of considerable discipline and culture. It is what may almost be called a philosophical habit of mind. The tendency in most men is' the other way. -.They say to 'themselves,"Oh, rll chance it. It. is a hundredi or a "thousand to one that such a thing happens, and '"therefore I Will not- take this trouble about it; "'I will not burden and annoy myself, in fact, to "c ineet a mere possiZiify." That is, perhaps, the reasoining of nine men out of ten, where they are left to themselves. As contrasted with this careless habit of running risks, the habit of acting so as to provide against risk- is a philosophical one. But how are we to- indoctrinate colliers with - the principle and maxim of acting upon chances? It will be said that danger i5 visible and apparent in a. coalpit, and an object of sense, and not merely a truth of reason. So it is to a man who goes down a coalpit for the first time. He finds himself in black Tararianu dungeons, the walls 'of which threaten to close in 'upon him, and the roof'to fall in and crush him every' moment; he sm'ells Stygian smells and exhalations at every step, and he 'seens to himself to be in the veryjawsofdeath. Butallthisisasnaturaltoa pitman as the 'light of the sun, and he does not connect it with danger, any more than the mass of railway travellers. connect a railway journey, with, the, 'idea of danger, though they may kmow as a fact that many' accidentsoccur on railways. It is true that the"pitmnan may have seen accidents in the pit, and have been himself within an ace' of being shattered by an ex plosion, and it- might be supipose& that the actual experience of danger would 'make him sensitive to it. -But here again the facts of -huzan nature apeak Otherwise. It does -not follow at all as a matter of course that 'the experience of danger 'produces caution. It, depends entirely on the character of the manii-_hether it does so or does the very reverse.-If aman has aprovident habit of mindto begin with, he is strengthene' in it by the experience of danger; - if he"has niot, he is'generally onlymade more careless and improvident by such experience. The shockl of contat with real danger once over,' the rude, -undisciplined soldier,: or - sailor, -or pit man, triumphs in having got over the -horror of .it; he has looked Death in the faee and lives ;' he has surmounted the great' crn's then, and now he feels as if he: oula fear nothing again; he 1 glories in -having got '-ver' the teor bf death, and being now a 'free man.. HEe exults 'in his_callousness as a sign of nvictory, and congratulates himself on having thrown off a weight and burden under -which the rest of mankind who have' never undergone this-prooess labour. -- Thus much-opon the general principles of human nature. But 'that labouring.clau;which aiernate3 betwee]n extreme Ilabour and the most sensual and kind of rest is a ' annnal- Thde o r is a peculiarly inprovident pitman descends into dariness, where -he worka -in uneasy positions, in holes ana corners, in bad, aiufoating aVr, for' so nany contiluous houis; he theI comnes up to the. light of 'day, unfit for 'anything' butinerely niiaal' ret 'and indculgence.

There are some crimes so horrible and unnatural that: the bare report of them cannot force itselJ upon human .belief without strong confirmat-ion. Such a one. is tthe assassination in cold blood by Austrian troop3 of the, Roman Tribune, AN,-GELo BR-uxETm, better Inown as CicsnuAccHro, togethex wsith his two sons,' one of 19,' the other oi 13. years of age, and four other persons.

He rejects it as cc'nta to all the rales ef international law, as -n a5tacic upon ae independence and dignity of his Crown. BeIipns upon the psincipleS of eternal iustice, which pre.

Or zatiserhevrould notdo: 4his,-LordPalmerston woulV d not even giLve hinseL' the troublo to reply at all ; he would *ncst probably send the :meddling, representative -his pnPorts, And has not the King of Naple, as '-ll as Great - Britain, the right to look after ids own hoinour and that of lis people? ae may, as a proof of his go0cdWil, listen to: communaicatlon5 miaewith a view to the consolidation of pxublic order in Europe; bht then susch comamunications must be made with hsat moderzation and deference whichb is due to a free and independent' Sovereign; and he alone must be allowed to fo.-m his judgment upon the propriety of tho proposed measures ad of the moment for carrying -hem out. No onie exCaptthe King himself can form acorrect judgment upon what arcumstainces may require. It is asserted that the present Ete of things requinrs certain alterations and improvqpsents. It is stated that the armed attacks of the revoln'ion agpinst the Government of the Two Sicilies hare peased. This is primsd facie evidence that the system opposed to them, and wbich is the object of such violent attacks, is 'not so useless or so baneful as some per. souns vish it to bo bElieved. Bat, it is added, the necessify for such a system no longer exists. The King is not of Wzis opinion, and his will cannot be opposed unless the ex. zrcise of superior force can be asserted as a right. But ;what will then become of the principle of Royal authority'. and. what value will be attached to the acts of a Government which have emanated under the pressure of a foreign E?owsar? Under such circumstances any concession, however justifiable, would lose all effect. His Majesty Sing Ferdinand, therefore, regards himself as perfectly justified in maintaining his prerogative, and of notifying' his intention to decide himself alone upon what ought to be done, and the proper time for doing it. EHe ardently desires that that time may speedily be at hand; sutiticannotbodenied that the violent and systematical a?ttac7s of the English press and. the demands thundered forth in the English Parliament are of a nature to adjourn that timo for tho present. Is it supposed that such means are calculated to calm the evil passions in a country still- a prey to the revolutionary doctrines of 1848?. It cannot surely have been already forgotten that the Central Committee of Italy only recently established the principle *'that political assassiation was not a. crime, especially when its object was to get rid of a powerful enemy,' and that this same committee put a price apon the head of. the King of Naples, and pro. snised a reward of 100,000 ducats ' to the man who rid Italy of this monster.' Coasidering such recent facts, it is not only the right, but it is the duty of His Majesty the -Eing of the Two Sicilies, to act with the greatest caution, and not to relinquish carelessly a eystem of government lv7ich he thought fit to adopt, as much in the interest oE his subjects as for his own safety. It has been asaerted, and attempts have been made to establish tha assertion, that the Constitution of 184S, under which the above execrable -principles were openly promulgated, is the fundamental law of the kingdom of -Waples. But it is overlooked that when that Constitution was proposed to the Sicilian Parliament they rejected it eith contempt, and asked for the Constitution of 1812. The concessions then made by King Ferdinand IL. had no other effect than to increase the demands of the revola-ionary faction throughout the whole of Italy, and the zisings which took place at Maples and at Palermo were the nignal for risings in Sardinia, Rome, and Lombardy. Is it tesirea to see a renewal of those dreadful crimes and strophes of which unhappy Italy was then the theatre ? The Constitution of 18i8 would be wonderfaully adapted to .-ring forward a repetition of them. Bat,.on mature refection, that cannot be the idea of the Cabinets of 3;ondon- and Paris, whose object must be the maind-enance of the peace of Earope, so dearly bought '3specialily it cannot be the view of the French Cabinaet. After having taken sach energetic measures at Lome to put down revolution, France surely cannot seek to Create it in Italy. This would be in direct opposition to that wisa andcleverpolicywhiuh has been so successfulUy carried out. France and England should also reiember that the Var in the East was undertaken precisely to prevent a foreign Power from interfering in the affairs of Tur. key. Any similar interference in the kingdom of the Two Micilies would be a curious anomaly, not to give it a more Tprecic qualiheation. King Ferdinand cannot, and wiU not, lelieve in anything of the sort. He places full confidence in the acknowledged principle so gloriously established by the Courts of Paris and London, according to which every independent State, although much weaker than the Power which wishes to force its counsels upon it, has -1he incontestable right to reject those counsels if they eontain Ea menace or an attack upon its independence. eh King-is firmly zesolved to adhere to what he has said. If, however, an attempt should be made-which is scaredly possible-to go further (pawer outre), His Majesty, relying -on the justice of his cause, would appeal to the patriotism -of his peopl, and, trusting to his brave and faithful army, -would repel force by force."

NEW IN[VESTION TO, PREJnyEy Srn Bo1rcus EiPLosOEs.-Yesterday afternoon an experiment was mnade nt~ Manchester, in the presence of a number of eieintifie gentlemen; to teat an invention to prevent steam boiler explosions. The trial took place at the works, of the patentee, Mr. William Routledge, Nevwhridge Brass k'oundry. The apparatus,.which is of most simple construction, consists of an elboowv pipe connecting the fuinace'with the side flue, aid is fixjed just below the wvater level in the boilr, ut ay e fiedat ny levtio, tr in any position an opnngitoasidle,o centreainegsi that is wreqidn red. Thqispipe isd pefoated wppith ao numberd of hlsaboute half sur ofth bole. The mnoment the water in the boiler, from neglect or otherwise, is below the level, and leaves thi pi p hare, the heat from the funace acts upon the pugs, which melt, and t-he steam, escaping through the hloles, immediately relieves, the pressure in the boiler, and in a abort. tine ext.inguishes- t-he furnace fire, thus'preventing at once the possibirty of the bursting of the boiler from want of water, or injury to the, boiler from the action of the-fire upon the plates hae of water, whiclhlatter cause so frequently results in ultimate accident and loss of lIfe;,for, though no immediate explosion takoesplace, the plates are so weak-ened and injured as to cause some future accident, for whih no reason can, at the tine,. be assigned. .The present. patent. entirely obviates this danger, as any negle6t on the part of those in chiarge oDf the boiler mnust he attended withmmediatle discovery. The experiment tried on. toiss ccason wa-s Very successfT ul Iless than one minuteI after the water wias let *Â°off, so as to leave the pipe il the boiler juist 'banr the plugs melted away, and the steamescpaped through the holes.

DA4nT.ifoort Co,vicr PaRisoNt-The eighth report of Colonel Jebb, surveyor of convict prisoms, just issued, gives some interesting information relative to Dariancnr pison. The establishment having been formned as a prizn ,'or invlid capable of light labour, at is of importance to know how far it has answered the nuspose as regards health. Phthisis appears,to be the c&use of the greatest msortalii,y, but during the year 1855 there was a considerable reductika in sickness and mortality. The deaths' only amounted to 24, and tbis decrease, as compared' -with previous -years, was the mnore remark-able from the increase that had taken place in the invalid class. Out of 545 pr-isoners received during the year 18.55 not mocre than abouxt 20 were ablebodied men. The convicts are chiefly employed, in agrincultural work--in reclaiming the waste 3morland, hy trenching, draining,anncoigitsoe walls Another work- is cutting turf forfuelandligzht,andunderthisbeath governor reports that, notWthstandingthevarieolenes of the season, the turf has been securedin excellentorder; 2,SI0tons have been stored, which telded am3oneyvalue of 1,0931. l0s., and furnished the prison with a. valusble supply of fuel and lig'ht.

'Admitting the communications of -The Times to be 'substantiaBy correct, and no less correct thanusignificant and -startling, the' T-uam era. 'proceeds in this .strain:- . "F3rom several facts which hare hitherto escapced discus-' sion and comment,'.the Irish Catholic public are beginning to feel that a newv era of: ecclesiastical policy for this country.isa-about'tocosnmenrc.

'This notion is giving rise to feelings of mist'rusb 'These feelings' have hitherto been-marinfested only,in.a negative -manane'r. But, if thc .-colicy: of 'maintaining Vhiggery at the expense of the freedom of religion and the raigts of -the nation is persevered in, it is diffiult to say to wha't disastr'ous results it may lead.". - THi POTAO.' The following statement respecting the appearncle of the old blight in the pbtato crop in Kerry appears in a' trustworthy ' local journal (the, Tre7lee Chroniicle) which c'ame to-hand thirs~mor~nnr:_-;T r -" There is no den,ying'the ' fact :any longer that-there is a potato' blight nearly- as general' 'and rapid en ever; but there never was solsittle fear for the supply of' *'ood~ on the 15th of August as there- *is at t.hapresent day, from the first appearance of the 'disease ns it is called. Whether this is caused by-a'feeling'of' security thatthe prosperous state of the country engenders, or whether it is that people are getting used to 'this yearly misfortune, and think light of it or nut, isquestonable but any one 'who will take a la statistical trouble to cone at the facts of the case will find a universal opinion that 'there is a very large'growth of the potato, and a more abundant crop, beside a greater average under it, than there has been for several years back. 'Time has, however, to prove how the produce of it vwi keep, and the greatest croakers, admitting that the .crop is riper and better grown now than usual at this date, give good reason to hope that we have more food secured in the crop of 185G than we have had for 10 yeas.: Poorhouses will fill slightly, of course, sometming more than if there was no blight, for iamers dread the purchase of.breadstuffs too much to keep supernumerary hands; and these pulsations in the Poor Law returns must be expected henceforth as 'regurly as the harvest season. Still, it is most gratifying toany one-to compare this' day with this day ten years. The staring consternation of every class at the total destruction of the provision of a teeming pauper population,' and not a bit of cheap corn in the country-never to be forgotten by those who witnessed it,-contrasted with the' present. opulent state of the farming and labouring classes, is, to saythe least of it, a surprising change to those men who buttoned up their pock-et and became absentees in 1847 and 1848, exclaiming that the country was gone, nothing could save it, and looldng on the far-seeing capitalist that was buying fee simple eStates at 13 or-14 years purchasa as a lunrtic." - REPRESENTATION OF CLOIT:IL. ~Already two 'candidates for the seat about to be vacated by Captain John O'Connell have issued their 'electoral addresses. The first is from 1r.' John Bngwe'll;of Marlfleld,the virtual proprietor of the borough; and what M:r. Bagwdll's political p3riniples arc may be gathered from a passage or twYo extracted from hi,s new conlfessnon of fiaith;-- -" The eprinciples -upon which I look for your sauffraaes are. tose of civil and zeligious freedom and equality in the m,ost extended application of thoter trs, andI shall ever qpp6s4 the political doctrine that would maintain the :privilege of anypartkcul.r class to the exclusion of the great body ofthepeople. I lokupon the grantto i. aynthas an instalment '(amiserabole one ceainly) of what. is due to the church of the great majority of my fellot-subjects, and. as such am prepared to give it my strenuous sudport, and alsu.to advocate the removal of &ose disabilitieslately ihposei by the legislature upon the clergyen of .that church' by the enactmuent knowzn as theEolesiasticalT.itles' Bill. A thorough reftormer in church and State, I shall consider it my duty to give my unquialified aid to any measure that may be introduced for the adjustment of the' temporalitres of. the former, feeling as a' Protestant (sincerely and firmly attached to that form of worship) that' the cause of religion.is not promnotedby the maintonance of an establishment antagonistic to the feelings of the people, and in -which the emolument is too frequently in the inverse ratio to the services to be performed." Tenant-riaht, as a matter of course, will receive the support of Mr. BogweU, who, according. to local belief, bids fair to win the majority of the sufflrages. 'The second candidate 'actually in' -the field is Mr. Patrick Joseph MuiTay; of Dublin, a' Romanu Catholic gentleman;' who, having cried " ditto" -to al that Mr. Bogwell-professes, completely overrides his opponent by avowing himself in favour of an Irish National Legislature "The placeman 5may deride it; the placeber may sneer at it; the Englishman may smile at it; the paid journalists of the Ministermayridicule it; but the war closed may onedayrather over England (as it has gathered recently), and then If the Iidsh peope are ready to claim it. can placemr en,canpnacebeggars, can anylanister, evenlthough backed by a Parliament of purchased supporters,' re}use the just demrand of the ation for r the loAct of UtJnion?

Bogwell will, it is said, receive the support of the leading Roman CathoEic clergDy. The other perobable candidates are Mr. Cazrew O'Dwyer, exm..ember for the boroughn of Drogheoda ; Mr. Charles Bianconi, ju.m.; and MIr. John Reynolds? ex-representative -of -the Irvish mnetropolis.. Ths is pretty well for a beaining. A letter from Clomnmel repeats the story that the fugitivemembereforTipperarywas lately seen near Coolnamuck, and had successfully evaded the pursuit of the police. It is added that it was positively only early last month that he left Clonacoody, when the mansion was taken possession of by Captain Kellett, to whom the place originally belonged. The monster indictment against Sadleir 'which is lying at the Crown-office in Clonmel covers half-adozen of shins of parchment. THEE lOLLOK- ESTATES.

Bradsshaz.and a3l other smsuals of advertisements of locomotion inform you that a coach vis from Giscow, by Loch Lomoind, to Dankeld. I booked two places-by that coach, and paid the fare to Dunkeld. MIny other persons did the same. An English clergyman, with apirt of five; an American gentleman with a similr party; a French gentleman, and others. At 10 o'clock las night (an hour'behind timel, the moonL obscured and the rain letteirig merrily, we diew up at a roadside inn, and wep told that we were at our journey's .end. - There was an stant inquiry about r6oms. "All fll," was the answer, " but we have a public room, and there are four or five beds in-a oottage had by." Several of ns made for the house to arrange for the apportionment of this little oasis of accommodation, when our fellow-traveller, the clergyman, a spare, mild' man, the very image of morification, met us ~on-the threehold, and announced, with a bland unworldly smile, that he had secured all the room that wasto be had. einquredwheretherews another inn?

TEhe aim, therefore, wb&ji-thq new reforms had, 'as --to consolidate again the central'powser and to constiuct a united state insa Euripeanl sense of the 'wod. But, instead of ke4 ingi min that aState. inl order to fourish anid develep itself, must lie likea living org IiZatOi6n which all memabers, must have a close connex-' ion, but at the samet time be endowted with a life and functions of their own, the Turkish statesmen were only 'intet n forming as complicated a mechanism as poible, supplied 'with life and movementfromthe centralauthoritynlone. Theyare thus succeeding in: extinguishing one of tho remaining sparks, but the whole body becomes every day more inert. The Governmenb has just taken iaothex.wp. in this false direction. Eigdht commissaries have-b&xi aBpointed for the -difernt provinces of European Tuirkey,-for Ualonica, 31onastir, Janina, Skodva, Adrianople, Widdin, Silisntrin and Sophia,-toact as political agents.of the central Governmentawith the different governors. All these eight commissaries are clerks taeLnfrom the Foreign-office, from which, curiously enough, the measure emanates. These commissaries, -if they are not to be puppets, wil take away the last shadowr of power - ftm the governors of .the provinces. According to the idea of theGover ment,theyaretoactasakind of control over the. corrupt practices of the Pashas, which is noffiing but pure sophistryj for who sends corrupt Fashas to the provinces, and who keeps Pasha convicted of corruption and poculation in their places, but the Government atC6ntantinople? The&eaper nd safer bi would- cerally be to remove the corrupt ?as1as=intead of controlling them, for such Icontrol is virually impossible. If the commaries sent to the provinces-are honest, there will be continual intrigues on both sides; they will not r,ork together, and the affairs of the provinces will suffer; :if they are dishonei, there will be two who will make fortunes at the expeu-e of the province instead of one. A partial change in the Ministry is talked of. The late Mnimahan -Mehemet Kibrisli, now President of the TWansuat,s finally aupointed as EXtraordinary Ambassador to Russia for the coronation of the Emneror. H Eis appointmnt is however only conditio; it depends, namely, on whefier the uans shal send by an Extraordinary Ambassador a noicaticn of the acceson of the Emperor- Alexander or not. The Mlnisty wanted to waive this point, and to send an itraordinary . Ambassador on the sple hint which Prince Gortschakoff gave to Asi Pashzat 'Vienna that such an Ambassador -would be re ceived with pleasure by the Emperor; but theSltln will not agree to this, and *Mil not consen that an' Eitraordinary Ambassador of -his should go-to the coronation of the Emperor without the notification being made to him, as to every one of his allies, of his accession by a SDecial Ambassador. As ordinary Aiibassador . to-Russda, Nanmik Pashanow Governor of Broussa, andformerly sent ior Bg land for the-firt loau during the war, is mentionedi Another changewhichis likely to take,place'isthe removal ef the President of- the Council of State, Sefik Pasha. Hedis a well-meaning add ihoneu mnan, but, not up to the work, which equk4 a statesman and r.msn, of great euergy,with thep orgai4 of combativeness strongly developed, for the existence of the Council of State -under presenft-eir cumstances is -nothing but one eontinual -battle agai the corrupt practices of Government officials, snd if a ny efficient remedy is to be apT)?ed it can only lie done 1y an independent body like the Council of State. It is, therefore,-o- --the utmost importance 'to have a man at the head of this Council -who is able to raise it to the importance and positioniwhich it ought to occupy in the State. - Letters from Persia mention .a curious . fact, namely,' the appearanlce of -the Englishiag on the walls-of Hferat. As all accounts agree in the fact there canl be o .doubt abot it, but the Persian'a hav.e two versions :to account for it. Accordin7g to s6me, it is the work of the- mysterious Englishman who wa supposed -to have been at Herat at -he time when Youssouf han was-still master -there. A3 I wrote you atthe time, the Peimians e-ere very much puzzled: by -this .-aAn, who- was: disguised ~as I a cattle dealer, and asied f6rliis removAl, to-which, howrever, the people of aHerat-opposed themselves. Thehoisting of 7the Biitiqh flag is now attributedby sorme to his"agency.., T he other VerSiOnl of the 's.ory is, that the people of' Herat 'got a3 reinforcemern,t of several-hundred horsemen-frorn the sou:th, who :W~re' seen-to enter by the Persian army before-Herat. The people of Eerat being apprise that this arrival had been seen by the Pemiansi and greatly magni.ified oni aecount of the ! t which they raised, toq,k advantag,e of thi!s to spread-thexzumour that.a-large' :English force had emilere7d Herst, and in congrmaw' tion of this they hoisted theEngigsh flg. -- -, .Newshas arrived that the'ussians have reoeeu- pied Anapa. - ' . ; - '.

- . H VXTYD ESTAT&ES. - (}='a OUR SPECrAL COR0 D )T.) - WASHINGTON, Ato. L. We havo just p 'ed through one of those periods, called by the learned in atmo3pheric phsnomena "a I heated term." oait fitly is it so named; accor,ing to oes snd registers- there: has: 1been .thing equal to it, in dutration and degree, for 68 .years, that is, "iithi the memory of man. This inteme heat set in' about the lth of I July, kept the thermometer at the highest ranges,. __hirough. aU the nineties, -to several poizts >abovea hundred,tiil"the 2 th, *hen some thunder znd rain, the precursors of. a heavy stora tf both, on the 30th broke it up, and rest red a more endurablet temperature, hch - we- are io6 _joying with due thanu'dlness. There has been Ecarcely any rain in the coast district since the last -TiCek in June, and the descriptions of txe effect, of -the long drought were beginning to be alarming. The -rnit crops were suffering greatly, some sorts have ill but failed, grass looked as if ",burnt with hot-rollers," the rivers were falling rapidly,-springs and wells drying -up, and the navigation of the canals was suspanded; fires increased in number as the Mimosphere became aid, and wooden-ce-nemnnts more than usually inflammable. It is said that - periods of drought are becoining more frequent in -America, and that the climate has been sensibly affected by the gradual destruction of the forests of -tJe interior. Bat such heat as we have lately had is not usual for more than three or four days toge-ther. Howr to-""keep cool" has been the question,, - ana, with poltics as hot and feverish as the weather, it is a marvel Eome recent irritations have paEsad off without physical mischief. I You are aware that the assault on Mr. Senator Sumner by Cslonel Brooks, a representative of South Carolina, was denounced by one of M1r. Sumners personal and political friends in langeage naturally strong. In what other, language could the assault, however provoked, be mentioned ? For his denunciation, MIr. :Burlingame (of Massachu*cetta) received a kind of challenge,-explained, and it was supposed the unhappy affeir was settled.- 3ut withathe merciless discus.ion every word and action undergoes in this arenaWbf political conflict di& 3isaparicularliabilityto mrisundestaudin end misconstructions. Mr.Burlingame'sexplanation was mzsunderstoodandrevoked. Promptly came asecond challenge from the southern member, which was accepted, and the battle-ground was fixed by the challenged parties, on the British side of Niagara, out of any State jurisdiction, north or south. Colonel Brooks refused to travel through the -1"4 enemy's country," the North, to reach-it ; plainly stating he could not do so without risking his life among Abolition [mobs, who would have revenged Mr. Sumner's injuries in a manner unknown to any code of law or honour. It(is asserted that Colonel Brooks has received piles of threatening letters from the North to this effect, and his friends contend he was perfectly justfed in declining, a meeting at a place,underall the circumstances, preposterously selected. On the other hand, it is as stoutly maintained by the Northerns that Colonel Brooks might have gone to the- Canada side of the Falls in perfect safety; so, with -assertion 2and rejoinder, the matter rests Mr. Burlingame and his second left Washington on their way to the ground, but were stopped at New York by the refusal of the other partys attendance, and returned to Washington, where both the possible belligezents were put nuder heavyba;lto keep the peace. Mr. Barlingamehas published a final "card" on the subject, containing several passages even stronger and more provocative of extremities than -the original speech which was the cause of the difficulty, though not its source, and leaves the whole matter to the public judgment; at which point I will drop it also, addin, merely that a reply to it is beingprepared on the part of Colonel 3Brooks. I give this summary of the quarrel because it has beenthie one topic of interest here for the last 1Q days, and because, though the beginning of the transaction may have reached you, the end of it is of more recent date. While these incidents have been passing here, Colonel Brooks has been re-elected by his constituents, with only a nominal opposition. the adjournment of the Legislature is fixed for the 18th, th ough, as the business to be done appears to increase rathaer than dfiminish towards the . lose of the sension, the "H ouse' may wish to prolong it; the Senate, it is reported, will strictly adheTe tothe day appointed. 1In the last few days good progress has been made vith several deferred jnea-- sures. The Army Appropriation MBll, an important portion of "Supply," has been -voted at last, nwith an amendaent grafted on it, highly displea3ng to the Southern interest, and not much otherwise to the Administration. To make conditions with the ruEling power, or insist on having grievances reme-- died before granting money, is a recognized jpractice; here ihe grievance has been the action of the federal Executive in the territory of Kanas; the federal troops have been employed to suppress the legislature of that part of the population which emigrated to Kansas determined to make ! it a "Frea& State, the Central Government having saided with that portion of the settlers who' had occupied, or at least were occupying it, as a tiave territory. It was a race to gain the territory by the rival powers, for the conflict is deeper in princple and results than that of ordinary party, and theExecutive backed the South. It caused a strong rally of the northern members in Congress to stop the action of the Governtment within the territory, which could be done most effectually by refusing to vote the funds for paying the army, or coupling the grant with conditions in the form of amendments to the Appropriation Bill. Several were proposed, more or less stringent; - the one now casried provides that no part of the military power of the United States shall be employed to enforce the enactments Of "the other" Legislature of Kansas, the rivalof that suppressed by the troops, till Congress shall have decided whether it is a valid Legislature or not; and, till that decision is made, the military shall only be employed in the territory to preserve the peace andl protect property. It is required, also, that the militia organized in Kansas shall be dis. anned,and anyfurtherinflux of armed men stepped, theL.tterp rovisionbeigeasier to enactthaexecute. Thus qualified, the appropriation was voted, but as the Lower House has not, as with us, the sole power of voting money, the Senate will have to determine whether the grant can be accepted, coupled with the conditions. - It may strike out the amendment, and then the supplies munt either be granted as usual, or the " Free territory" members must take the responisibility of stopping them altogether; The question whvetherthis distant aud unsettledterritory shall be slave or free has fallen like a stone onong the machinery of the State, and stops sone of the cogs and wheels at-every turn. Of- the teveal blls settling its- constitution, the one passed by the House is favourable to the frea cause- anl even restoresMthe Missouri compromise.. -The Snate is being "'bombarded" ith. abolitionist biUls -aud pro visoe. - : . The other discussions have been chiefly confliled to acts authoizing the executioi of public worki and improvementsat the expense of the Federal Treasury. There are,doubts -whether the principle on which they are founded is admitted by the coastitution; and it- is altogether a very knotty coatro7erqy. It is very evident that harbours of refuge, and embaniments, and clearing au-l1 deepening rivers are excellent things per se; and | any given localfity is very willing to have & pull! at the Exchequertb obtain them. 13ut the other States, which may be less favoured, objectto the general funds. being applied to create particular advantages; sach improvements, it is Aaid, are the proper work of the several States themselves 'or private companies. But the pressure towards the Federaltreasm.y is strong, and in some:cases evell the veto of President Pierce, cancelling bils that involved such expenditure, has been overruled. These appropriations and the Kansas difficulties have been the business of tEie -ornin g sittings foi, any days. -By an excellent anrangement -the day sittigs are kept fe of speeches iiitendedfor a larger circle than the Rouse, or " caJmpaign" ad. dresses, made to damage tie prospect 'of the rival parties in the-Presidential election. Any topic would serve as a peg to hang an electioneering harangue upon, and everything* might be included in a debate, except the question thereof. The mornings, tleLrefore, are devoted to s,trct business matters, -voting, calls of the House, and pawsingand rejecting bills, with the mini7mum of discussion. But from I till 10 every evening there is a sitting for speeches onlyi,and any member may express -his views of the candidates and their parties at any length he chooses. The speeches ar& reported, and, if considered telling, are printed and circulated as election documents. That they- should be listened to does not seem to be-quite a necessity, for the evening audiences have often been very slenaer; but there is no pe:il of a " count out" and even if the assembly sink to eight or ten members the address equally'anwers its purpose. Without this arrangement, the business of the Legislature for some weeks befoie'the close of the last longsession that comes within the* President's term.of office, would be'alniost stopped by the speeches made to infiuence votes out of door-s Bat the appearmnce of the Iall -during an evening sitting is something of a contrast to its morning aspect. Then the places are filled, and as neawly every member is reading' or "writing letters, and receiving or sending off correspondence, it is a basy' scene, so active that it is difficult at first to suppose it- a deliberative assembly, with which we associate -a certain idea of quietude, of listening, orappearing to listen, evenif the speaker is afflictinghis hearers with a table of statistiics. uthisnmanner therewis,with us, a great sacrifice o. time to courtesy and exter-' nals; by the American system that time is turned to account; an immense mass of correspondence is disposed of durig a sitting; every desk is covered with books and papers, and a corps of pages, young, smart Mercuries in short jackets, are in attendance to bring in or convey out all communications; they are suummoned by clapping the hands in the Oriental manner, and are thus kept in pretty constt motion. The members do not quit their seats to hand in notices or amendments to the clerk, they are too busy. There is such an air of occupation beyond the business of the State, that the characteristics of a public office and a Legislature seem nearly equally blended. The interior of a large bank in full activity, the clerks absorbedin their ledgers, and a cashiet onhiB legAs addressing the mnager on some detectedifregularity that must be set rig;t before going furtlier. would present something of the appearance of the House in a morning sitting, when a member is speaking on a point of order. The sculphtre, marble pillars, circular galleries, crimson draperies, and the seats for the ladies, must be added to bring the iMustratinn a little nearer the reality. But still the indications of active business, and the faciliyties provided for it, predominate. It appears probable that the post commupacation between America andRuglandwillbe extended. A contract for a mnothly mail -is proposea t be given to Mr. Vanderbilt, who has just constriucted a large ocean steamer of superior power, which is expected to: make the passage in eight or nine d4w3. The committee on post offices and post-roads, after hearing the evidence of Mr. Vanderbilt, has agreed to report a bIll to -the House, asldng it to grant a subsidy of $16,000 for a mall every month, with Southampton as the port of argival and departure. The committee proposes also that the trips shall be extended to Bremen or Havre; and thatnotice shall be given of the withdrawal of the additional Pllowance ito the Collins. Line for carrying the niails between New York and LiverpooL The proceedings of the Vigilance Committee of San Francisco begin to excite some misgivings as to what may be their issue. A motion for an " interpellation" to the President on the subject has been talked of; but it is understood he declines to interfere at present. The Committee has arrested a. Judge Terry for stabbing one of its officers srho attempted to arrest an individual on its order; it has also intercepted and seized a supply of arms belonging to the Federal Government, which look5 like treason, or levying war on the State, but inay admit of explanation. The Committee is charged with the design of separating from the Federation, to set up as an independent State; but no evidence of such intention has yet appeared. It is asserted by the supporters of the deposed local authorities, that the maadministration of justice, and the impunityof atrociouseriminals, which caused the movement, were to be attributed to the 'respectable merchants and inhabitants themselves, who slirked the duty of serving on juries as much as possible, and compelled the judges to fall back on alower-cla3s of men, who acquitted everybody able to buy their verdict. If the honeet Moderates will not. undergo the labour of law and politics, both naturally fall into the power of the -unscrupulous, who are always the most active. -At last the abuses grow intolerable, and a revolt of respectability is the only remedy for them, for rascality in such a position Wi notloosea its grasp. The state of things which produces Vigilance Committees is not confined to California, though there it exists intensified. Ini New York such a movement is spoken of as not impossible, as a substitute for alleged laxity in the municipal government and the police; a Sanitary Committee of Vigilance has actually been proposed, to take the cleansing of the streets into its own hands. At Cincinnati, a few days -sfince, a secret meeting was held to organize one there, and the step, though deferred, is understood to depend only on one, contingency. It Eeems as if a steady, continued action that'-would prevent the evils . was more difficult than a violent cure when they have passed the point of endurance. v - The trial of Mr. Hlerbert, a Californian member, for the murder of a waiter at Willard's Hlotel, has just-ended in an acquittal. It was the second trial _on the first the jury could not agree , the second jury. was more easily coiuived, and the Aceusei left- the court amid the congrtuulataons of his friends. The long duration of both- trials and the repetition of aUl the evidene lessened the imtrest of the procedings ;' everybody too, felt -certain beforehand that no punishment. would be. inctced.

I THE LAT EXEUUTIO -AT DORCHESTER. .: TO THE EDITOR OF THE T3IES. Sir,-I am sorry that it is necesary for me to intrude once more on your important columns, but the letter of I Mr. Mallelt in !Z7ie Tmss of this diay requires some comi- ment. I am happy, however, that,-although this gentle. man has thought it necessary to warn your readera to receive my version of the "history of the case of Martha Brown ,with great caution," yet he tacitly admits thefvery chargo of partial justice vwhtih I laid against tlie Home Secretary, and exculpates hi3n on the ground that he erred on the side of mercy. My letter to yon, Sir, was simple in its details, and contained the partiHe. lars of the caso of Brown compared with that of Celo-. tina Somner. I have never said the wretched woman was unjustly executed, although I did say, public opmion was opposed to her execution. My words were-" On the justice of her sentence I ,Wll say nothing." I assert, featr lessdy, thatthere were extenuating circuamstances in the ease, and if the woman who deliberately murdered her daughter deserved a pardon, Martha Brown has been "judicialy murdered." T believe I can satisfactorily answer all Mr. fAhett's questions. First, why was not this story of the womans il-treatment brought forward at the trial ? The murder was committed on the 6th of July, and within a fortnight she had been tried and convicted. H r learned cousel, Mr. Edwards, was either entirely un. awara of the facts of the case, or he thought theIe was not sufficient evidenco against the woman to coi. vict her even of manslaughter. He rally did 3not ka w what evidence would be brought against her. I believe t e prisoner never disclosed to her counsel the very facts which, had he known, would have saved her life; and the defenco was, that there was no motive' for the comramssion of the act-that the prisoner had ever4thing.to lose , and nothing to gainbythe death e' her husband. Sho had always been a kind wife, and on the very night of thelmurder had prepared his supper, awaiting his return, the untouched food being in the house as a proof of the assertion. She denied tho charge of jealousy, which was assigned asamotive, and complained of witnesses having been brought forward at her trial of whom they had heard nothing at the prelimi^nary examina. tion. Now for tho proofs of the husband's ill-treatment-;. the first, which cannot be denied, is, that he had been with Mary D)vis, th h whom she knew he cohabited. I appeal to the feelings of your readers if anythinig cound possibly be more exciting to & womian's feelings th7n Â£ consciousness that hei husoband was' with a wnoman who had estrangedlhim from3her affections, and that with heShe wiYs indulging his most criminal appetites, while she 'was preparing to WelcoMe him.to a frugal meal? Again, tha medical evidence asserteathat the man was deprived of con. sciousness at the firdst blow, and, we may infer, was unable to scream ; yet screams were heard at the distance of 150 yards; and from whom did they emanate but the wretched w,oman who was enduring the merciless persecutions of her husbsnd? The whalebonewhip, or ratherthe remarns of it, were found by Wootton, tho Netherbury policeman, on searching the house; a large portion of it had been burnt. Mr. Mallett asks, where wero the marks of violence? I ask, wasthewoman's person examined? But, a.tthe coroner's investigation, she admitted maris were on her person caused by the death grasp of her husband, who "held her so tightly that she was unable to get away or call assistance," j All tha other parts of her confession -wer borne out in evidence, and on her ascending the scaffold herT remarks were, "Oh that I had told the truth, in the first place, and then I. should not be brought to this PI On the very verge of 'eternity she said her confession was trae, and I see no reason why it should not be believed. I ask, then, ill your impartial readers -if there were mot extenuating circumstances in this' case .whieh' were not to-7e found m Somnes? "lwhy, then, liberate tho coldW blooded German murderss and hang -the English.alayer of her adulterous hiusband? The er-ing in mercy in our Home Secretary is a fatal error'foe his reputation. It throwshim open at once t, charges of intring partiAl ~ julstice. If we must have lifo for. life, let not' tnat, woman who. has committed a murder 2a foul -as any we hve heard of- escape, while sanother, Who. liils a man who has just brutally maltriated her, a pys the dreadful penalty oÂ£ the law. One:word to MrI MUet. is" it not most 'unreasonable- tosupposp that the "benevolent people7 of whom he -peTeak would pSrompt the woma i- to. falsehood? Surely he-wouId not insinuate that tile amible` chaplain. who ministered sofaithf7l;ly to her, who urg^dSher to confess the truth;who -led her tCo Wm who isthe way, the trath, and the life, co77ld sh her, much more' prompt her, to attemplito save her life by niserable falsehood. Oh no! he could not forget his sacred office, sior -ouldhe drive the poor dying woman's soulto misery for ye and for ever by tempting her t further sin- -- I am; Sir, yoin-s very resneetfollk - BlEaRY 9; coM I ZnGponlaug. i0.

Ifth-ey should, however, enitertain any doubt upon the point, it wo-uld, peiap- be the better cofirs fur them to find the bill, in or tat te casenmight be fully inquired into by the pettyjuy. ~The other chirge oftmanslaughter was one of amuchuroreb serious character, and appeared to be the result of a drunlken frolic of.a Tvery bararu decrption.The w'hole o6f 'the parties appearedto b intoxicated aul wie, the. deceased was lying on the deck on board a shp Nhrlae the occurrence took place, one of his comrades poured A quatit onabhover: him, anid'it -was et fire. to; ana 'the eceased was.buiiit. so severely as. to occasion his death..

On the .8th of August, however, Messr. Few and Co., the solicitors for the dlefendlant, receiviea a communic-ation fromn Messrs.

It wasconsidered bythe prosecutors that the intereats of justice,might suffer if the trial were.o tak-e place at the present session, and therefore it was net. intended top refer a bill before the grand jury,! With regard to disha=ig the recognizances of the defenidant, it seemed to him that it ~would be merely an idle cieemony, because; if the grand jury should .retuin a& true bill.against him at th&e: next, sesson the reces of the Court would inmeiately isu,adh doXbe liable tobe apprehended upon that process.

I| A PLEA FOB THE OLD GUABDS. TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir, -la the byways of London and its neighbourhoodI live a few invalided Guardsmien-warrdors of the Alma and of Inkermann-maimed watchers in the winter trencheswho, after bearing the heat and burden of the day, have been forced by wounds or disease to lay aside the red jacket for ever. If the generousEnglishmen-wvhohavebidden the "Brigade" just hiome from the Crinmea to a banquet were to extendI their hospitality to these heroic pensioners of that brigade it would be a kindly, a most graceful act. I am. sure Grenadiers, Coldstreams, and Fusileers would relish their dinner none the worse because somee of their old comradee ate, dranl and were merry among them. | ~~~~I am, Sir, your obedient CRVlnATfÂ£ A AFOUPCLASPEDi M1tA. l ADg i.
EDIORIA.L COuRnzyxS m A1amptJcA-One of the favourite arguments of the advocates of the duello is, that where the obligatior of personal " aatisfaction" is acknowledged it begets a decorum of manners and a courtesy of expression highly conducive to social refinement and a chivalric tone of societv. A remarkable exemplification of the effect of the duello is occasionally exhibited by our editorial brethren down South. Those chivalric papers of Richmond, Virginia, the Wliig aud the Enquirer, vhose former editorsfought one of the most savage duels afew years since that the history or dielling makes any mention of, are just now engaged in a war of blackguardism which most be closed by personal coroaat with some sbarper instroments than the steel pen. Both of these papers have bestowed the highest encomilums upon Brooks forhis assault upon Senator Sumner. The Enquirer recently alluded to the W7ig in these highfiown terms:-" The sheepish spirit of a stricken conscience is 'cetrayedin every word and syllable of the paragraph. Its disgusting egotism and vulgar taste are altogether worthy of the writer's reputation. A man -who scribbles under the habitual inspiration of refuse whisky, whose daily contributions to the pablic press consist of the lees of last night's revel; whose gramnmar would conLdemn him to the 'foot' of the class in an old field school-house; whose literature is limited to a familiar acquaintance with the labels on the brandy bottles-he to talk of editing a decent newspaper i. This, indeed, is ' sublime iWpudence.' Beaten in argumentw convicted of every sorVof inconsistency' ansd self-stultification, driven into a corner and pinioned there beyond the nower of escape, the editorof the }iyg has our permission to indulge his low-born instincts in lowllunnp bravado." OÂ£coarse the W7iig replies in a similar itram, to whih its antagonist rejoins with incrdasedmigourl and bitterness. Aainlng worse than this could niot pjes- I sibly be exhibited, eveo where personal satisfaction-is never demanded nor given. Aem York Tmi5mes.

The candle at that time:-vras fixed -on the face of the coal in4 the straight heading, and it- wvas flaming up towards the top more than wns]a, he thought; from the effect of firedamp. iHe told Henry Salathiel that his candle was flaming ver-renuch, and asked himr whati wa>s The matter with its HTis reply was, " There's a little of the nature of fire in the coal; I suPpoese t 'flagag'-towards that." W=itness said nothing more, bat looked to sce if the current of the air passed as usual, and, after looking both a,ides of the tram, and finding it did, he took it easy t,hen. The candle w;as" flagging" a goed deal more thin usual that morning, because there-was a great deal of iire in the coal there. t By the jury.-I had heard that- William Thomas was going to wvork in David Mtorgan's st;all, hut David Jones did not tell me co on the morning after the explosion. I don't mnow from whom I herd -that Thomas was going to that stall, hut I heard at the pit, after the explosion, that be was groing there.

Owen.-Thc strength -of the fog -that nmorning fas up above, andrHenry Salathielcarliedthe candle down y hlis thigh; that is the usnal way to carry the candle, and it was not because of the fog that it was so carried. y the Jury.-I have never seenahe candle without a cap to it, but it is worse in some parts of the colliery than The other. There is fire in ethry part, but lees in the South Wales than in other headings. I have not worked n any other part ex;cept beyond- the -"fault," -and a little in the South WVales. I cannot toll the length of the cape on the candle in the wvorst part, because wvhile turning the htading I worked with safety lamps* the coloar ofrthe cap was between blue nd grey. I havonevercom Wlained of the state of the air except when I was tuning Salathies heading, about 10 months ago. I thencom plained to the fireman, MIorgan Rowlands, and means were taken to improve the air, which was better afterwards I have worked in the Dinas and other pits in that dingle, and have seen fire in all of them. The cap was less in the Casdmer than the Dtnas, because there was more fire in the latter pit. By Mr. DiEkenson.-I cannot say what was the length of the cap upon the candle on the night bureceding the explosion, but particularly noticed it"' flagging" up. By the Coroner.-I was startled a little when I sawv the cap, but I was satisfied after lookin to see if the air passed. Idid not atndch serious importace at any time to there being a cap on the aandle, provided air was passing By Mr. Owen.-aWhen the airs weak it sometimes briugs foul air with it, and causes a cap on the candle henry Salathiel corroborated the evidence of the last witness, and stated that the fog noticed that morning extended from the little heading to John C-emawr's. He thought nothing about iiredamp, the candle not being affected by it. B3y Mr. Dickensom.-I have seen a capton the candle every day since I have been working in the co tery. Occasional l it is an inch and a-half in length, and sometimes less. think there IS some danger whenthereis a cap on the candle but did not complain because I thought the danger was not sufficient. I never mentioned it to the fireman. Griffth Williamy was nhet called.-imThis witness had advanced 62 yards in the colLiery when the explosion took p lace,the ire passingover him.

When I wentesaidhe wasafraid to work there because of the fire. I askXed whether he had seen the firemen t-day, and had no answer. I put the candle in the corner of the goaf to see if these waas air passing there. I found there was, and said, "Thercis air passing here, boy." I then took th candle and moved it horn one side of the atoll to the other to try the air and the candle had ainad look; there woas a large cap on it and that "flagging" (mounting towards the roof.) -It was nearly three inches high, and rather blue. I told ihim no to -work any more there; that I would not on the oface of the stall until he had cut the to on. I then wrent aw.ay, leaving him ini the stall. Wzdliam Thomias was not killed in the explosion, having left the work beforo it occurred. I knowv HezekiaIh Davies. On the Thmrsday before t.he explesion becoame to my stall and asked, l"How is the air with you here? There is no air with me." "Don't say so," said I. "No, there is none, -indeed," he replied. I asked if he had seen Rowlands. HIe said, "-Yes, and he had told hin that there was famouns air in Grifith Williams's heading. On tryan it they could hardly see it moving between the goaf andthe face of the he eading. and there was a cap two inches in length On thentop of the candle, Davies afterwards told him that he had been from -his stall to Wiltam Thomas's stall, through the wind aye and the candle did not move at alLi w The witness was still uder examifnation when the midday adjourrnment took place.
THE COLLIERS' STRIKE AT BARNSLEY. TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TIhES. Sir,-Would you favour the committee of the colliers now on strike at Barnsley by inserting the following reply to a letter reccntly issued by the proprietors? Yeour so domg will greatly oblige (we trust, for the lt time) the men now on strike. The proprietors state that " Mr. Minto is not the manager, but underviewer, acting in all respects uponthe instructions of Mr. Woodhouse and Mr. Brown."r If such be the fact, and seeing that Mr. Woodhouse only partially goes through the pit some two or three times a-year, Mr. Brown, in ordering Mr. Minto to build up the "stopping" which caused the explosion on the 2d of June, we consider has s ehown himself, despito his long experience and the great confidence reposed in him, an unsafe man to work under. The proprietors lay great stress on the report oi Mr. Morton, the inspector, as to the safety of the pit, its good working condition, &a. A circumstance with regard to this has only come to the knowledge of the deputation, who upon that occasion waited upon the inspector; within this last week, and which wMi we trnst, considerably mnodify the opinion then given, as it clearly showsv that both M. Morton and the deputation were deceived by Mr.' Minto's statement, that there was a proper "leakage" left at the "stopping," the truth being that there' waa po~sl tively none, which the mnan who mad e the stoppingWis xlow readytoprove. Woewouldalso state thate M Moriton es unable to inspect one-tenth of the workings as Barker, the fire-trier" of that portion of the pit where, the ethlSion took place, having had his clearanespaper givenh'nTy othe acting proprietor, refused to accompany the deputation, as lie could have Pointed out the dangerous carts of.the work-. ings. The proprietors now refuig us all wrequire-vis., our cclcearance psparr," to which wre are folly entitled, seeing that we have never signecl any agreement to give notice,-we leave the public to judge of the lind feeling of our late employers; for, if ;ee have signed any agreement, why do they -not take the propr legal steps -to compel us to return to our work? Rtl eey had the power, there is vary little doubt that they would hav acted upon it long ere this.

.BISHOPS AND CURATEs. TO THE-EDITOR OF-THE TIMES. Sir,-I fear to encroaeh on your columns a second time but when you have read this letter I think you -will allow that I have cause. The last number of thc Bccleiastical Gazette contains 30 advertisements from clergymen in search ofcurates. Oat of this number one only-offers -100. ayear, there is one at 901., one or two at 80l., and the rest rapidly fall from 701. down -to 261., wvith a small furnished house, where the rector is non-resident. One is unique. It offers 601., with the use of the rectory house, the curate to buythe rector's furniture at a valation of 3601. ! Anothergives 701. in a parish of nearly 6,000, where there is daily service. And this, too, in a town in which of course the expense oF lodging and living is comparatively high. The applicait in this case is moreover precluded from increasing his beggarly income, for he is required to be "active, zealous,-fond of schools,andparochial visiting, andwillingto devotehis whole timetopastoralwork vwithinthe parish." Some of these offers are avowedly addressed to men of "private fortune," and in them there is either no stipend given, or it is so small that shame prevents its publication. There arenot less than seven which give only 501. a-year, or half what is- expected bytrained national schoolmasters, and much less thanis given to a respectable commercial clerk, wvhose education is infinitely less costly than that of a clergyman, and- wh6, in addition, enters on his calling at least eight or nine years earlier than the parson. I do not asl;, are the above sMms suficient remutneration for the work Derformed, but are they a fair interest for the amount sunk in an emnensive school and college education ? We hear indignation and pity expressed, and justly so, when ladies are insalted by the offer of 201. a-year, with board and lodging, in return for instruction in the high accomplishments required in the present day; but the curate, on o0O, or even 701., wrho, after payment of rent and housekeeping expenses, and the charges incidental to his calling, has 201. a-year for clothes andlaundress, presents an unparalleled example of domestic economy. The question resolved itself into this :-Are we to consider our curates as professional men labouring in their yocation for a iust reward, or are we to consider them as a "mob of gentlemen who preach at ease," and who take orders as a means of supplying a pleasant occupation? If the latter, then the question of stipend assumes an aspect of very trifling importance; if the former, then let your readers cry shame on the present state of things, or else con. fess that their moral sense is somnewhat blanted. Sydney Smith used heartlessly to joke about the fear of a "rising of the curates." Were such an event to hbappen, would there not be sufficient reason for the strike ? NL 3O.
THE STBIKE AT KEWCASTLE-OHPYKE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I have read in your journal of to-day, for the first time, the account of the strike of the stonemasons, at Newcastle-on-Tyne, for a weekly half-holyday. As honorary secretary of the society which had the honour to originate the present half-holyday movement, I would beg permission to say that the conduct of these nien, as thus reported in yourcolumns, has producadin my mind but onie feeling, that of the deepest regret. I feel assured that such, too, wil be the light in which it wlhl be viewed by everv gentlemain -with vhom I have the pleasure of co-operating, and indeed by every enlightened friend of the cause. In my opinion, no single thing could have occurred so likely to retard the movement, which previously was progr,ssing so satisfactorily, neither could anything be more thoroughly senseless than the proceedings of these men. I say " senseless," being at a loss to conceive how, upon any intelligent principle, the concession of a weelay half-holyday can be demanded as a right. We have invariably sought it as a boon-&hs one, indeed, not calculated to entail much, nor necessarily any, sacrifice upon masters; but stiU it has ever been looked upon by the London Association purely as a boost. I feel quite certain that the distinguished persons who, with so much of disinterestedness and ability, have advocated the cause at our recent public meetings wrould never have tnus identified themselves with the movement but from the belief that they were thereby reaUy fostering a more genial feeling between the great employers of labour and the labourers themselves-L--the surest pledgo of the prosperity of bot.h. As one who claims some right t be considered as a friend of the industrial classes, I sincerely trust that the woridng men oI England, so far from copying,4will do aU that in them lies to discountenance the insubordinate and suicidal condLct which has occasioned this letter.
