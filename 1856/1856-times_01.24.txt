Xv. 'Wilson coming forward and pToving that in some branches of productive indushtry at lead, -we are not .ao far bebidiahand as has beena reI-sented. He commenced his paper . by --dividing candles into four different: classes:-_frs, thos' ie from be second, to mad f n a ,. eluding spermacetti, tallow, a-d-cocoanut; third, stearie oi fat acid eandles; and, fourth, comiogtes, beiDg a minixt of stearic acidandaneutralfat. Disaisngtheto<flrAp mdentioie6cof these classes as undeserving of much. XtteAi ~tion, ]&Wilson concentrated the attention o£ his.uaudiice upon tihe two last. He sho*ed0 . a series of iltustratfoe the various hbymical elements of which the different r w materials used in candlemalringwere made up. He then pointed out that to the substance called "glyoerine" th% .low illuminating power of these materials was chiefly duel and that to get rid of that substance ws the rooesitj which firstc-lled the aid of scienoe to the manufactuiri *Ohce introduced it had, in a very short time, Taise Vcndlemaling from a clumsy, offensive, mechanical tradu -int fairt-ass elymical manufacture, one offering .tl widest fleld for applications of the highest ehinmly. X_ this seience Chesreul, the great rench chymist, is now thr recognized father, and, in maldngthat acknowledgment LUs night, Mr. Wilson added, "My respect for him 'wa lately put to a severe trial, Which, however, it stood when in the splendid show at the closing of theParis Eshibition I hadto seebimWaIkuptotakethe&nedWwhich jury, groupof juries, and councit of presidents had awarded&to Price and Co., s1ai which Ihad gone over to4Paris to receive." Although it is quite Ltree that Chevreul's xesearches into the chymist of fetty bodies laid the foundations of modem scientifil candlemaking, yet a considerable time clapsed, 1aa nimany -costly experiments were necessary, and many fruittess attempts were made, before the manumfacire as. slimed the forms under which it is now successfully prOSe. cuted at the works of the company. This Wi at once b3 appreciated -hen MIr. Wilson tells us that in Octolber, 184p Price and Co. emphyed 74 men and 10 boys, who mngnu. factured about 20 tons of cocoanut candles, value 1,590DL; and about: 12 tons of stearic and composite candles, val 1;2271., during the month; whereas, in the corresponding month of 1855, they employed 1,09S men and 1,91lboys a,i girls,tunieag out per month about 707tons' weight, or 79,500W worthof stearicanudcomposite candlesandnigt-lights. li Wils4n traced, in a very clear and concise manner, howstep by step the manufacture had been improved to a point whicb ensured its commercial success. Ittappears from that inte. resting narrative that composite candles owed their introduction to the demand for cheap self-snuffing candles, to be used in the window iluminations on the occasion of the Queen's marriage. After carefuly aoting the defets of al -previous attempts in dealing with the raw materials isea for candlemading, Ifr. Wlson thas descibes the process of hsutp,hric acid saponification, which at length yielded Eatis. factory results at Price and Co.'s works, and which is still carried on there. Six tons of the raw materiA., usually palm oill, though occasionally cheap aninal fats, vegetabla oils, and butters, and Japan wax, are used, are exposed to the combined action of 6 3.7 Cwts. of concentrate4 sulphuriG acid and a temperature of 350 Farenheit. 1Che'glycerine 'is thus- decomposed, large volumes of sulphurous acid are given ofl, and the fat is changed into a iiixture of fat acids of a very dark coloir, withlaihiesnmeltigpoint. This is washed to free itfrose charred matter and adhering sulphurie acid, and is tliem transferred into as till, from which the air is excluded by means of heated steam. The distillation separates the Eblac acidified palm oi into the pure fat acids which come over in vapour, leavingthe charred matters and other imputrities which are not volatile behind in the stilL The dis. tilled material is then either used for makdngthe ebeaper description of candles, or is subjected to hydraulic pressure, first at the temperature of the air, and thenat ahigh leat. and (the liquid oil being expressed from it) is converted into, wvhat are knovwn in commerce as Belmont sperm candles. Thus-had been secured a process by which the fat adst .were set free from the glycerine 'with but small cost for the chyrnical agents employed, and these fat acids converte into valuable materials for candles but the glycerine became vaste, and a considerable los was also incurred owing, to the decomposition of a part of the fat acids by the actiorm of the sulphuric acid. To overcome these defects, 'Ir. Wilson states that in January, 1I8, Mr. Tightbian, an American chymist, obtained a patent for exposing fats and oils to the action of water at a high temperature and undegreat pressure, in order to cause the- combination of the: water with the elements of the neutral fats, so asto praduce3 at the same time free fat acids and solution of glyceriue, Mr. Wilson described how Mr. Tightman proposed to effect. this, and then goes on to say that, in the course of some experiments which Mr. Tightman's patent led him to try, it struck him that steam passed into fat at a high tempera-m ture would effect by a gentle process what Mr. Tightman. contemplated doing by violent means, and resolve the neutral fat into glycerine and fat adds. Experiments made on, a sufficiently large scale had since satisfactorily proved that, he was not mistaken in his conjecture. Many hundre& tons of palm oil and other fats, 3Mr. Wilson stated, had bees worked in this mamer, and the glycerine thus passed over in the form of vapour was now selling at a higher rate tha. its early prized associate, the stearic acid. lM. Wilson gava -some curiousandhighlyinterestingparticulars astothevariedi 'and important uses in the arts and medicine to which this new substance bids fair to be applied with extraordinary advantage. For slin diseases and burns, as an embalming agent, and antiseptic in preserving food, fruits, &c., itap. pears to be remarkably well adapted. The photographer has experimented with it successully, and Dr. Simpson, of Edinburgh, is preparing to test its fattening properties uponpigsagainstthoseof codliveroil Inalludingto tho former objectiouable use of arsenic in the manufacture o_ stearic candles, Mr. Wilson explained that, by pouring thamaterialinto the moulds at a very low temperature, they formation of crystals, which was the result sought tb be avoided, was now snore effectually overcome than it ever had been by the employment of that objectionable ingredient and wax. I will be gathered from this sumumary that the two leading features of the system under which Price and Co. carry on theiroperations are-first, the sulphuric acid saponification, process; and, secondly, the distilation by heated steam These appear simple enough results in themseves, but a& Dr. Playfair, who. presided, pointed out, they have only beenarrived at after long and patient investigation anu experiment, and no one who visits the extensive and admirably organized establishments of the company ca resist. the conclusion that, whatever merit may be due to the chymicai discoveries of Chevreul, Gay L,ssac, and other French savens, the credit and praise of reducing these discoveriesintopractice,andopeningnuptothe candlemak-ernicand inexhaustiblesuppliesof rawmateria3, belong of nghtto this firmanaits acomplishedmanager.yett,heircl Smc,never. theless, have been most unjustly and ilhberally dealt witla bothinl8landlastyearatParis& Ontheformeroccasion,the jury recommended them for a council medal, and formaly protested when it was withheld.

Some aniiety continues to be felt lest the eagerness for peace at Paris should exert a prejudicial influence, but its effect is counteracted by the certainty that no relaxation Will be permitted in the preparations for a _ontinuance of the war should new evasions be attempted on any material points.

'The case of Stralian and Paul was lately conbxasted with that of the Aberdeen Bank, to illustiate the fineness of the line which separates the eriminal from the civil jurisdiction, so as in many instances to involve the difference between perfect imnunity and the most frightful penalty short of death. Another example is, apparently, now to be Cited, which, although connected witlh numerous details of individual ruin current in London during the past year, has scarcely yet been presented in a coherent form. Ten years back a corporate body called the " Westminster Improvement Commission" ras created by act of Parliament. Its object was the construction of Victoria-street, to forma communication between the neighbourhood of the Houses of IParliament and Buckingham Palace, and it was endowed with advantages which gave it much of the Character of a Government undertaking. T,hese appear to have comprised an unrestricted power of borrowing money, coupled with grants, out of the London Bridge Approaches Fund and the improved tates of the parishes in Westminster, while the im- sing nature of the body was further strengthened byecertain special safeguards against an abuse of the privileges thus conferred, among which were provisions for a solemn declaration, to be subscribed by each Commissioner, that he would faithfully perform his duties, and for the exaniination of the accounts of the corporation by Her Majesty's Commissioners of Woods and Forests. From 1845, when their act was passed, until a year or two back Ettle was publicly heard of their proceedings. The progress of the new street was observed to be lamentably slow, and difficulties were occasionally spoken of, but in the present state of the law the p?eople of London have learnt to look upon such reaults as inseparable from every attempt at improvemnent, and they attracted no attention. At leng,th it was found that the commi;ssioners had boeen issuing bonds to builders and others to an enormous extent, thatthese bondswere being daily advertisedby various holders for sale upon almost any terms; and, fnally, in January, 1855, that the comnmision had become totally insolvent. A meeting of the bondholders was then cazled, at which the commissioners attended, but scarcelyattemptedany explanation. No accountswererendered,andacommitteew.asappointed to investigate. These gentlemen named four of their number to conduct the requisite inquiries, and in theirprinted report, together with a petition subsequently presented to the House of Lords, and a bill of complaint lately filed in Chancery by certain of the bondholders, the following allegations are contained. The chief issue of bonds appears to have taken place since 1852. At that date the commissioners had incurred a deficiency of 100,0821. They hiave since, as far as can be ascertained, put forth i onds to the amount of 1,030,5701., of which they vay 89,7001. have been cancelled, leaving 977,0501. as the uamount in circulation on the 31st of December, 1854, 'whentheystoppedpayment. Besides the means thus raised, the commissioners are alleged to have mort.gaged the freehold property of the undertaking for 271,5001. This property has lately been valued, and is stated to be worth but 167,2001. Hence there is not enough to cover the mortgages, and consequentIy at present not a farthing for the bondbolders. It seems, however, to be considered that aIbout 140,0001. of these mortgages would probably be ignored in a Court of Equity, and also that, as two-thirds of the ground are still unbuilt upon, the whole would come into greater value if the street I were completed. It likewise appears that under the net the builders on the estate have power to redeem their houses by paying off their debts either in mnoney or bonds, and the bonds, therefore, may continue in some demand for that purpose. At present, it is understood, they are selling at the rate of about 81. per 100L., and, as owing to the activity with which they have been spread among the public by agents who were offered a large perventage for recommending them, they are held to -a very considerable extent by professional persons, clergymen, widows, and others, the ruin that has ensued is not only analogous to that caused by the -vase of Strahan and Paul, but far more severe, since the amount involved is 1,000,0001., instead of 780,0001., and the prospect of recovery only 8 per -cent., instead of, as in the latter case, 4s. in the pound, or 20 per cent. It does not appear, however, that any serious consequences are Eikely to fall upon the commissioners or their counexions beyond the trouble of resistin in their corporate capacity a Chancery suit, the costs and iielays of which already promise to add heavily to the losses of those inividual bondholders who iave had the publi spirit to risk the penaltie; of such a contest. Among the allegations of the complainants, it is stated that in 1854 alone the issue of hbonds amounted to 575,000M.? of which 475,0001. vere to Mr. WVilliam Mackenzie without any proper. aecurity; that _58,0001. were put forth within a tew - cays of the announcemento£the comml¶sioners that' they coul no Ionger pay interest-;-th-at,-b-e-f-o-raS'13-u endimg payment, they attempted to negotiate a urther issuewhen the niarket price of the bonds had fallen tol200!. perl,OOO. athat Ar.

RAILWAY IN!TTELLIGBNCE. FASTEIR COUNTES. The foUowing is an abstract of the chairnan's final answver to the Conmnittee of Investigation * "Gentlemen,-Youmust, lam sure, betiredof criminatory and recriminatory documents. You must be anxious to terminate that agitation as to past management which, whatever maybe its conclusion, cannot but have a prejudicial effect upon our property. 1' Throughout the controversy forced on me by the comnnittee, my object has been, while disposing of every charge against myself, to point your attention to the consideration ofrwht is most conducive to your future prosperity. I deeply regret to see that, in the 'Observations? which the committee have published upon my 'Answer,'your prosperity is a very ninor consideration to the promotion of their ovwn ebjects. The tone and tendency of aUl their 'Observations? are to prolong debate, to alann the public, to support the case of the East Anglian, and to depreciate Eastern Counties shares. It is high time, indeed, to stop proceedings which have already lowered the value of your property to the extent of nearly two milions sterling "1L You are, first of all, told in tho ' Observations; that 'the policy of peace,' which I claim the merit of ha established, was not my policy, but the policy of others. If such were the truth, I should still be entitled to the merit of having successfuly carried out that policy * for it is one thing to desire peace, and another to effect it. Bet if a 'policy of peace' were the policy of the managementof the Eastern Counties Company prior to my appointment to the chair, how comes it that, when you elected me in 1851, I found you at war with al your neighbours? The committee have not attempted to meet the great and all-conclusive facts, that when I became your chairman your line wa what I have described it, and that in the four years which have since elapsed you have absorbed all competition into your own system. "2. You are told that my statement upon the important subject of 'capital' is 'utterly ridiculous; but I bego you to observe that the committee have not attemted toI dispute one of my figures. I demonstrated to you that by an addition to your capital of 1,21S,0001. I acquired for you new lines valued at half a million, andan additionalJ revenue of 450,0001. a-year, or 37A per cent, upon yzour out- lay. The corointtee think they answer me very effectivelyi by inquiring-'If Mr. Waddington by his addition to capital of 1,213,000l. gains 37A per cent.. or 450,0001. a-year, what ought the other 10,000,0001. of Eastern Counties capital to have gained?' "I Let me answer this questionbyanother --'If Mr. Waddington had not spent 1,213,000?. inobtaining the control of 226 miles of competing railway, now inco rated in your system, whiere would the other 10,000,000?. of Eastern Counties capital have been to-day ?' "As my 'Ansver' hasestablished, your capital would have been almost wholly lost, and you would havo been unable to meet the permanent charges on your line. "3. Upon the subject of the Hackney-wick branches you are told, as an answer to my case, that, ' although these lines have been open 12 months, not a single head of cattle has passed over them to the new. market at Conenhagenfields.' The reply is that, although the line maxy have been open 12 months, the new market has not been open half the tune. We were beforehand with our arrangements, while others were behind. The facilities we proposed to afford for traffic to the new market were completed in anticipation of thercompletion of arrangements by the North London Railway and the corporation of the city of London, whose plans are not even yet rfected. But this is no fault of mine. I havedone everything in mypower to expedite their arrangements, and I have done all I could to provide for the trafflc in the meantime. Even this, however, is converted into a charge. You are told that ' so little did I anticipate any cattle trafflc by these branches that I actually induced the board to take a lease, for 14 years, of some land abutting on the company's cattle depOt at Tottenham, whence [the cattle are driven to the new market.' Now, the fact is true; but the inference is not. The land referred to is a small field of two acres, rental 20?. per annum, adjacent to our Tottenhamstation. It wasvwantedforour cattle accommodation. If I could have got it for half-a-year, or a year, I should havebeen glad. But it was not to be had except by talkin up nlease. It was taken on that lease, not because I did net anticipate a change in the cattle traffic, but because the field was needful for our purposes, and could not be got "You are aL-o told that ' the heavy goods traffic brought forward by Mr. Waddington as likely to pass to and from Camden-town and the Colchester and Cambridge lines can only occur by diverting it- from the original- routeover the company's line to Peterborough. By Mr. Waddingbon's policy (it is said) goods fromthe Victoria Doeks will only be carried over the company's line for seven miles instead of 102, as they should have been, direct to Peterborough.' Now, does any one in his senses suppose that, under- any state of circumstances, we could force the goods traffic of the Victoria Docks over our line to join some other line at. Peterborough? Does any sane man imagine that the NorthWestern and the Great Worthern would ever have consented to transfer to us their traffic to Peterborough, in. order that it might pass over our line, to their own disadvantae ? The idea is too preposterous. The real- fact is, that if it had not been for the Hackney-wick branches, we. should lave lost the traffic of the Victoria Docks almost altogether. The North London would have formed the com: nunication between those docks and' Camden-town which our polcy has secured for the Eastern Counties."

He charges the committee with prejudicing their'position on the East Siiffolk question; by unwarrantably taking on theiselves to send Mr. Mosely to Great Yarmouth, where he provoked the- inha-. bitants, assembled at a public meeting, to pass unanimous resolutions in favour of the proposed new line.

ANOHESTEE, SHREFFILD, AND LINCOLNSHIRR The half-yearly nieeting of this company was held yesterdayat Manchester, M1r. Chapman, the deputy-chairmian, presiding. An abstrac-t of the half-yearly report and accounts has upipeared in R'e Time,. The CnLURnMeN, afteraliuffingtovaiiou~snatters in the report, congratulatedthe shareholders on thereductionofwvorkiug e.xpenses, duetothe exertions of Mr. Watlin, the gnral msnger.He regretted t aeto avertortefe~h, saeof the relations.of the London and otWeeran t-he Midland Companies with the Great Northen Te directors of this company bad' invariably expressed the greatest desire to continue on friendly terms with the) Great Northern Company, and he was extremely sorry to have axt rpresent to anticipate a contrary state of things, .though he hoped an accomamodation miight yet be arrived at. Before the ternunstion of the agreement between that company and this, which expired onthe lOthinst., the directors-instructed = the Great Northemrn mnaer, anrd endeavour to renew the agreemenit on termis which should be fair to both companies, and revising those olauses vwhich this company* had "ood reason to complain of as unjust to their intereits. i=1ose two gentlemen met frequently, and arranged nearly al unatters in dispute, except the toll the Great Northern should pay for runnwig overnthis com y's line from Retford to Sheffield, therettbpadythGetoten for the use of the She e a nd oner two ote poits minor mmg paid In th e meantime the "Ten Towsent, °. betwen the dondon and NorthWester Gret Northere3°n, andld and Comani, obepred also; and this co an art the itatnceo the dreat Northemand soand and th-WesernCompanies, wa,s made aparty t,othe negotiations for a new agrem'ent, to embrace disputed points. Ther anfgers othe foEr companies, at the request of their respective hoards, met frequently for this purpose, and with an honest determination, as be believed, to settle all muatters in dispute. No one who knew those gentlemen could question their full competence to fulfil the trust reposed in them, anl no one could deny that the Great Northern Company was represented in the most efficient manner by their clever and indefatiable manager, M1r. S. Clafrke. These gentlemen first came to an agreeent on those general-points as to which thereo as no difTerence ofo Sinion among themn as a basis, and finally camne to a unanimous reolution to recommen to their. resp rectie beard t some honest, competent, and- impartial uapire should be chosen,to decde anl those quesons of amount on which the managrs wrere stil unable to agree, and thus avoid the necessity of going to war. (Hear, bear.) Thisirecommendation was unanimously agreed to by the four managrs anid signedh y each of them ; and it was accepted 'yth hoard of each compy, except that of the Great Northern. The darectorsofthat companyrejectedthe advice of the'raagr and in their -various replies to the recommendlation-s,sh (Mr. Chapman) interpretedl them, theywvishedthe other com-. panies to agree to dTeal wvithx the traffic in such a way as would practically ignore agreements existing wtith various companies ; also, as an option, that the Great Northern figures should be accepted instead of going to arbiti-ation ; and also, as an option, in effect.,thatthey should choose their own subject for arbitration. There the miatter rested, and in this instance, at least, if the four great comnpanies should engage in coin tiio it could not be said t'hat the railway m'aiigrs ad Zen the fomenters of discord, for they had sonthemselves earnestly desirous of peace. (Hear, hear.) He feared the responsibility would rest entirely with the directors of the Great Northern Company, but he hoped that Mrr. Denison would use the great influence he undoubtedly possessed at t-hat board, in furtlierance of that Yi of pw among railway comnpanies w'hich he had a him adocate, to avert what -would be a losing contest to all parties, buat more ruinous to the Great Northem that to any other.' The traffic of the Great Northern which would be placed in jeopardy was nearly 25,000?. sterling,I or about a sixth of their whole receipts; while thle estimate of the whole traffic affected belonging to the Mfidland and London and North-Western was aibout 88,000!. only. The directors; of this comipany 'would do their uatmost to p remote a settlement of this dispute, which involved also the question of the rer.ewal of some parts of their o greement with the Great Nlorthern, altliough th ey mi gt rarther benefltfor a-while by competitioni than otherwise, eause they were most anxious to av-oid the loss to the slhareheldlers and inconvenience tothe public which were involved. Mr. Denison, however, had thepower in his hands, he hoped. (Hear, hear.) Recurring to the internal affairs of this company, he hoped the recommendation in ithe report, to carry forwvard thte balance of 7,GO0!. to next half-year, wouldahoadopted, because, although the carrying forw-ard of large balances was objectiownabe under ordinary circumstances, in this instance it -was a measure of precaution, bearing in mnind that next halfyear thtey would have to meoet thie interest on the new 34 per cent, capitalized arrears' stock-, and that it was the worst half-year of the two. If the step -was proved to be uinnecessary by the rezult of their balance next July, they would only have waited six monthis longer for the division of this sum, whffle they would have increased their reputation as prudent shareholders. (Hear, hear.) The company had power, under their act of Parliament, to capitalize their borrowed maoney at not exceeding 4 per cent., and as the rate now being paid on theirmortgages wasabouat 41 per cent., if the whol could he capitalized it would effect a savin of about -20,000!. ayear. in ,conclusion, he con,. gratuTted the shareholders on t'he preFent ninost ainicable i relations with the North-Eastern Comnpany, andl observ-ed that the present was th e best half-y early S.tatem ent theo directors had ever been able to presen:t. HE.e had every hope that this concern would now oo continually improvinfg, and that it would soon be founFto have chan-ged its relative postion as compared with some others that had hitherto bee looked upon as more prosperous. (Hear, hear.) He maoved the adoption of the report. Mr. Tusi?NRm (director) secondedlthe resolution, which was carried unanimously. A letter was read from the Earl of Yarborouigh, -whose health is not sufriciently recovered to enable him to talke his plaea chairman of this company, expressing his grat stsatoatthe results of the past half-year's woring and his anxious desire to see a development of the, coa trade from Grimsby to the continent b)y the aid of the new Anglo-French St-eamn Company. Resolutions were then passed, declaring, the guaranteed dividend on preference stock, and one at- the rate of A5s. perr 100!. eoi the origina stock, and No. 1 Quarters.

ELECTION INTELLIGENCE. -- EDINBUR( A meetiag of tihe general comanitbee of- the Liberzl electorsoEf ]dinbergh was held in that -city on Tuesdiy afternoon, to consider what steps should be adopted-4 supplythevncyinh representation caused by the e- tiremenbtof theBight Hlon z. B.I Euy. Abore 200 gentlemen wrere piesent. The LOBD PROVOSR *ohows called to the diair, said, SA -was sure that every elector had received the announcement of Er.

TFherewas a night hon. baronet now present (Sir Wliam Gibs6onhi g),-Aisuo if ha had iccepted their sffrages once more, would,,- belevA have secured to himself the votes of- almost the entire cojsttency ; and lie regretted that, from private reasons, he, had not given them the hononr of nowhatretuin .binm Auother citizen had been named to .the electors, who-wasegl known for tt he had takeni the publc business of the:ciy for many years a for the manly and upright conducthe bad purued on all eions as wlls for the eminent talentsthat. distinguished him, (is Lordship referred to M AdmBlac, the weU-lm o publsher.) -He had no doubt that, sh-uldttey-aceedeto that gentleman their suffrages, his appointnent would give great satisfaction to the larg body of. the constituenoy (Loud plause.) s t Sir Mt.G. C.AiGskid that, in regard tolimself cormug. forward, he regretted that for private reasons it was impossible for hum atpresent to offerthem his services,though hehoped.the tme would yet come when they might renewr their former connexion. (Applause.) Hiis lords;hip had expressed regret at the retirement of their valued representative, Lir. Macaulay. He need nob assure them that that circumstance Was a matter' of the utniost pain to him (Sir W. G. Craig), but, ashe had seen the-right honr gentlean only yesterday, he was glad that ha could give them a somewhat grstifying accont of. the state of his health. He had had -two long interviews with Mr. Macaulay, whem helha found ia ex, cellent health and spirits, though he was suffering from an asthmatic affection, which prevented his leaving the hduse at night, and forbade risking himself during the day in inclement weather, and more especially prevented him speaking in public at alL He had, theUre, with that sensitiveness which was part of his character been desirous of relinquishing the representation of Edinburis, that they might have in his place some more active Tepresentative. His friends had long arged him to continue. in.the hope of his health being re-established, but, on his becoming satisfied that it wms impossible to expect that, he had, though with great regret, sent in his resignation. Sir W. Craig then stated that he had had repeated interviews, both at the time of his own resignation in 1S52 and since,- vwth Mr. Blaelr, uTging on him to offer himself for the reptesentatiorL of the city. Mmr. Black had long resisted all sulCh solicid tations, but he had at length assented to them so -far that if he were called on by a large body of his fellow-citizens, and if the- thought him qualfied for the trast, he would not shrink from the discharge of any duty whicJi they thought proper to confide to him. (Loud applaue.) He Sir WG. CLraig believed that there was hno man whoe could more fittingly represent Edinburgh, and that theret was no citizen more fufly deserving of that honour. (Applause.) On the motion of Mr. Ancurnxr.n TuossomsO, secondea by Mr. ADAs MoBmSON, it was resolved that Mr. Black wasafitandproperpersontofillup the vacancyinthere. presentation. The motion was cordially agreed to, and a committee was appointed to secure Mr. Black's return. Mr. Sheriff TEoMSoOs said, he would support Mr. Black's nominationwith thisqualification-thathe sharedhis opinion that the present war was a riglhteous one, and that it ought to be carried on till they secured a permanent and honourable pe-ace. (Mpplan.- Itvwas, however, his strong impressn - that M Black shared these view& Mr. Sheriff LOGAN said that, if 3r. Black were found to entertain opinions so alien from those of the rest ofthe community, they would doubtless all be free to do what they coudto prevent hisreturn. There was no doubt, however. of hlr. iBlack's soundness on that point. A requisition to Mr. Black wvas numerously signed beforer the meeting broke up. IEREFORD. HEMEFORD, JAx, 23. Last weekl three candidates issued addresses soliciting the electors for their votes in the expected vacancy, viz-Mr. Clive, the London volice magistrate Lberal), Mr. ievans, of Soften-court (Conservative), and MWr. Bidduiph, of Ledhury (Iaberal). *With a view, however, of preventing a division of the Liberal interest, a meetinga of munl friendr of Mfr. Clive and Mr. Biddulph was> held to decide whicht of thetwo candidates should -withdrwal from the field, when it was determined that Mr. Biddulph should retire7. Thatgentlenan, accordinoly, issued an address to the electors yesterday, withdrawng from the contest and inviting his' friends to support Mr. Clive; Mr. Clive also issued a second address, stating the arranement that had been made, and expressing his opinion that "no member of a Dissenting congregDation thouldjbe called upon to contribute to the maintenance of any fabrnc of the established church.', last night a meeting vwas held here on the subject of the ballot, at which ar ulv teded. A Mr. Whitehurt, of the Central Committee of. the Society for Promoting Vote by Ballot first addressed the meeting, after which Mr. P RnEmoRr, MP. for Leominster, defended tha ballot from the charge of being an un-English mode of taking votes, maintaining that the privilege of voting coul1 not be exercised by a large number of persons withoab bringing ruin upon them. It was perfectly well known that: iwhen the proprietorship of land changed hands, and the wpolitical opiions of the ownaer changed at the sme time,. the votes of a great majority of the tenantry changed too. (Eear,hear.) Heboewnonoblersidhtthoa to see a man, go openly to the poll, but they had no ritght To cal for the exercise of heroic vhrtues in the dischage of lawful privilees. Aslongras human nature wasewhat it was, people Could do dirty things, and act from secret and disionest motives, and the ballot ws the only remedy for the disease. HIe denied that the ballot would lead to frand, and looked to it as the means of defending the constituencies from a corruption arising from hope of gan (Cheers.) waws Mr. Carv then addressed the meeting, and wswl received. He said he was glad to avail himself of that opportunity of telling the electors that for many years he had been an advocate for the use of the ballot in the election of members of Parliament. The present sytem of -voting practicall disfranchised a great many most respectable persons. Se could point to tradesmen in the principal street of that city, who either didnotvote at all at eleotions, or who voted amainst their conviction. Persons well educated, and quiLed for discharging the duties reposed iu-- them, professed to have no politicl pri ciles t all rather than be called upon to give their vote by -ichthey might make enemies or displease their customers. (Hear, hear.) This was a great evil and one which the ballotwould remedy. For these and other reasons he supported the balot. Although he did not expect thoseiimmediateresultsfrom.n the measure which some people did (for he thought the advantages to be derived from the measue would be of' slow growvth), he considered the ballot would gradually remedy the evil complained of. Asto th chage that hadbeen made against the ballot, that it would lead to all sorts of fraud and deception, amd that electors might receive bribes to vote one -way, and then vote another, if a mian went, openly to the poll and recorded his vote aga:2nst his conviction he deceived al the world, but if he promised to vote one way, and then voted (by ballot) another, he only deceived one person. He hoped to see the measure introduced in the next session of Parliament, though he did not expecb those immediate results from its operation -which some per-, sons anticipated. Iir. Clive, in his printed address to the electors, also expresses himself favourable to a reform in the law, and oi the subject of the war says:- "Wo Administration will receive* my sup?ort which fails to prosecute the p resent most just war with vigour ani effect, forthus only can nn honourable and durable- peace be obtamned. It is not my wish that this courysnould ever ranskas a greatmihitsry Fewer, nor do I forzetho vthoronughly a state o f wa=r is at variance with all the hopes and pursuits~ which a nation should most dearly cherish; but yet I feel that our efforts must not be relaxed until our adversary shall have solemnly renounced his uailty pretensions; shal have made reparation for the pas, and give -security for the future." -Mr. Evans, on the same subject, writes:- "I. believe I shall most entirely represent your feelings and opinions by endeavouring to uphold the Executive of this-country in the great stugle in which we are now engaged. The fall of Kars, and tho sufferings of its heroic defenders at this monient, excite the indignaton. of all Engjland Believing that the surest road to an honourable peace, which we must all desire, is to prosecuts the wav with vigorI-ill give my support to any Ministry who honestly pursue the only course by which that blessing cam be obtained."7. MIr. Evans also expresses a firm attachment to the established church, and will support a judicious economy in the pubEo expenditure. The arrangement leading to the withdrawal of Mr. Biddulph has given umbrage to many " independent" electors, by vhom a handbill has just been issued, givingthe lawyers credit for the affair, and calling upon their brother electors to disregard it and to vote for their own candidate. - l VCASTL.F-ON=-T12E. - ;' It is stated, upon what appears authority, that in conse. quence of the continued indisposition of Mr. Blackett, 2LP., he vffl retire from the representation of Xewcastle-on-Tynq immediately upon the meetin of Parliament. r. e eorge Ridley, barrister, brother of Sir]ItthewWhite Ridley, of Blagdon, anid son of the late Sir MS. .idley, who for many years re resentel Newcastlc-on-Tyne,% will be brought forwvard in the liberal interest.

Itherefore presume to ask foryTotr r-upport. BaefoestatingmsyopinIons, Iwish ittobe distinctlyundertood that, if I am elected, I mnst go to the discharge of my dutiesunafettered by pledges; which I holdI to be unconstitutional and misch ievous. I am a sincere rnember of the Church or England, and I consider it as the meet important function of the University to educate the clergy and gentry, and through them all clasees, in the principles of true religion. I am entirely free from all ties of party and from party views. Myj opinions generally are Liberal. but Conservative, Tire aliflity and judgmient. with which the aifai,ra of the countrs have been administered by t e present Govenmuent in most trying times would render me desirous to give them my support. On the question of war or peac, it would be impoesIble for me, at' this moment, to express any opinion which the events of the next few weeks might not modify. Blutlnimaysay, generally, that for the saety and honour of this eountun and for the good of mankind, I earnestly hoAh that no efforts wil be speare to prscte the wair withL vigoor until a solid and well seemxed peace be obtaned When such a peace has been concluded I trus that the Govemnment of thin country wil never be allowed to suffer ourmilitary and naval establishmaents to fall to the low ebb to which theyhbad sunk- at the commencemnent, of the present war.

CA'IAMRIDGE UNIVERSITY ELEOTION.- 46. Chester-square. 22d January, 1816. Dear Bumbury.-In re?ly to your letter of yesterday's date I am happy to tell you that ?am not one of your opponents, and anm not going to stand for tho University of Cambridge. The facts of the ease are simLy these :-On SaturdaY moraing I received the very unexpected inKomation that some persons of considerable influence in Cambridge and elsewhere wised me to come forward as a canaidate. I replied that, if they would bring me a requisition sufficiently weighty to justify my coming forward. I would do so. MY friends however soon found that they were too late in the field, and that such men as yourelf., pon -whom, perhapo they mifght have counted if you had been apphied to in the first insatnce for me, were already actively enga,ged on one side or the other. I ain, therefore, absolved from any obliSption to MOve finthermin thxe matter. You will prohably be sm-prsed that I should have Consented, even conditionally. to coDme forward, for Ibhave more work to do than knlow how to get tbroug'v, and there is no one, I iniagine. to whom personally a Parliamentary life would be less attractive. But there are social questions to which, and to the legisation about which. I have of late yaagvnmch atetion ; and it seems to me (perhaps with the captiosnes o a ystnde) tatthese questions are not adequately discussd mPariamnt:andthat even the voice of oen additional person ho are abut hemmight be valuable. I flt t,theefre,tobe a duity not to rejeet such an opportunity of becoinga cadidte,whatever presumption there milght be in seekingto epeset costtuency who may justly demand to have the firs me inthecoutryas their representatives. I so thronelygad,however, tIrat the burden of contest is notupou my coulem, ut ponthe far stronger and abler ones of Mr. George Denmn, t who I bg totendler mny vote.

LONDON, THURSDAY, J3M'UABY 24, 15G. Since the news of peace burst upon us we have been so engaged with our own affairs that we have not had a moment to devote to the consideration of the present situation and future prospects of Russia. We have endeavoured, as far as existing circumstances would admit, to take an impartial view of our own position, and should be glad if it were possible to do equal justice to that of our great antagonist. We have no feeling of animosity or jealousy to gratify. The social conditions of our moral, our physical, and our political positions are totally different, if not diametrically opposed, and we can sincerelvydesire the progress, the prosperity, and the greatness of Russia, because it. vould in no degree interfere with, while in inany particulars it would assist, the progress and prosperity of these islands. When the Emperor AizxAwDn succeeded to the throne, ten months ago, he announced, or those who "ere bequeathed to him as advisers by his father thought fit to announce in his name, to the Russian nation, that he would tread in the steps of PErTR, of CATB:Rnx-, of ALEXAk-DER, and of NrICnOL;AS. Ten months have passed away, and those resolutions have become an anachronism and an impossibility. Russia is called on to deliberate no longer about following out a policy of conquest and- aggression, but about the best means of preserving what she has won, and saving the labours of a century and a. half of fraud, war, aid intrigue from being scattered to the winds. Never was the choice of HERCULES between good and evil, between the upward and downward course, presented more clearly to any one, or with a more momentous result for good and evil to the human race, than to the Emperor ALEXAhDM at this, moment. The Emperor is said to be a. mild and benevolent man. Let him well consider the policy which he has inherited, the sacrifices which it has entailed, and the end to which it has brought him. When the Emperor NIcHoLAs, after having quenched the flames of the sedition which beset Iim when he first ascended the throne in the blood of PEST, MoVR.A-vmI , and their a'ccomplices, found himself undisputed master of Russia, he deliberately. fixed upon an end to which he devoted; without a sigh or a regret, not only his own life.' but the lives of those helpless millions whom PaotiInEcE had intrusted to his -stern and unrelenting hands. The end he set before himself was universal conquest and dominion, and, once having this idea firnly before him, everything else was subjected to it with an unbending and unpitying consistency. Arts, progress, civilization, internal transport, literature, and science, he gave up without a sigh for this one darling object. Master of a people neither warlike nor ambitious, he forced their ideas against their will into the direction of war and conquest. He maintained an army far larger than was needed for the police or defence of his vast empire, and in order to maintain it he drained the resources of his subjects to the very dregs, and compelled a nation that aspired to be the conquerors of the world to depend for its means of cultivation on the annial loan of millions of foreign capital. Ee formed the priesthood into a machine for supplying the want of military ardour by means of fanatical enthusiasm, and whatever he could save from the demands of his vast armies and arsenals he devoted to the establitshment of a line of tremendous fortifications, and to forcing into existence a navy in defiance of every obstacIe which nature and situation could oppose to his success,-a navy destined to find its grave in the very harboiur from wbieh it was intended to sally forth to the conquest of the East and of the West. UJtterly regardless of the sufferings of his subjects and of the principles of well ascertained economic science, and choosing to consider Russia in her gloomy isolation as an exception to all the other nations of the globe, he checked the natiural development of her commerce towards the South by quarantines and export duties, and every species of vexatious restriction, in the futile hope that by preventing the ingress of other E uropean nations he might facilitate the execution of his plans on the independence of Turkey. With a like view he lavished enormoous sums on the smaller Courts of Germany, well aware that by stimulating internal division Ihe was most effectually paving the wvay for the subjugation of Europe and the total extinction of her liberties. Thus iived and laboured he for 30 years, and in the 30th year, just as it appeared fuill-blown, the bubble burst, and showed him, when it was too late, that he had wasted his fine talents, his untiring industry, his almost superhuman energy, upon a mere hallucination, an unsubstantial chimera. The army in which he trusted could not be maintained by his finances nor recruited by his peasants. That exhaustion of men which befell the French Republic, after eighteen years of exterminating war, visited him before the conclusion of the second campaign. The fleet, which had cost him such infinite sacrifices, perished with an ignominy that even the heroic death of his admirals and sailors could not redeem, and whlich was only exceeded by the inglorious fate of those ships that lurked behind the bulwarks of Cronstadt, without even blocking up by their sunken hulks the passage which leads to the very vestibule of the Imperial city. These things are, we should think, sifficient to warn the Emperor AzmXAi.DER against following in a course pursued by his father with so much talent, so much fiTnnness, and such signal and notorious disaster. Let the son learn to be wiser if not greater than his father. Re has in the natural instincts of his people, in the inexhaustible riches of hiis southern provinces, in their admirable water communication, in the immnense increase of the demand all over the world for the raw material of food and manufacture, and in the exemption of the Black Sea from the presence and interference of hostile fleets, a boundless source of wealth and powver. It rests with him to become, if he wills it, the greatest exporter of corn, linseed, tallow, hemp, and hides in the world. The strictly protective tariff to which he has succeeded -was principally the work of his father, formed partly to encourage sickly and unnatural manufactures, partly to discourage foreign influence, and partly to defiay the enormous and unnatural expenses of his purely military and aggressive system. Let the Emperor AxA-.nDBz sincerely embrace tlle principles of peace and progress, and let him, without entering on any career of theoretical and unpractical liberalism, study to promote the material advancement of his people. Let him produce all he can, and open his por'ts to receive in exchange all that foreign nations can give him.' Let hinm reduce his army to the amount necessary for internal police and defence against external 'aggression, and employ the suiplus of his revenues in paying the interest oni loans raised for perfecting his internal transport and the execution of great public works. Let hini recognize civil as well as military merit, aiid turn the attention: of the nation from the arts which embitter and destroy to those whicl enliven and preserve life. Let him do this, and if it should please PRovmzDcz to protract his reign, like that of his father, to the fuill period of 30 years, lie will go down to his grave - in peace, not, like his father, amid the shouts of battle and the shrieks of despair, but among the tears and blessings of a happy and regenerated people, who wiU recog,nize in him among so many rulers and conquerors their first benefactor and their onlyfiiend.
The mice have met to bell the cat, the sheep to take counsel ag-ainst the wolves. The Railway Shareholders, finding themselves continualy beaten in detail by their respective directors, are trying the effect of a national organization. It is a very old story. There always were sharps, and there always were flats, and the latter, nnfortunately, are the vast majority of mankind. Every now and then the feeble units of society poiir their giievances into one another's bosoms, and attenpt a common canse. To the success-of such proceedinga in the political arena we owe the House of Commons, Trial' by Jury, a Free Press, the Habeas Corpus Act, the Limitation of the Prerogative, Religi6ts Toleration, and what we call our Constitutional Government. Biut in: the case of these Railway Shareholders there is a peculiar difficulty. It is from first to last, a pecuniary affair. The government of railways is a TimoCuACY, which is the very weakest of all governments, and the least able to stand either the chronic corruptions or the sudden excitements to which all governments are more or less liable. There is an utter-and unavoidable absence of the higher mo-- tives,-loyalty, chivalry, patriotism, philanthropy, and aU the other.-senilments that are the salt of society. If there. is the most moderate degree of commercial honesty that- is as much as- could be expected. if a shareholder is cursed with a heart, he devotes it to his country at large, and dc-s not lavish it on a -list of unseen and, unnkown shareholders-a mere catalogue of names changing from day to day. If, on the other hand, he is blessed 'with a hea4 he uses it to plunder his fellow-shareholdlers. He either operates in the market, or at least sits Watching the ups and downs, or lie gets into the direction, or becomes thick-with.it, -or is lookingoutfor a job. It's of no u3e to be a sheep, so ho chooses his lot vith the wolf, andrectHifes his own grievances, leaving others, to do 'what theypleasW with their own. There are, indeed, railway patriots, elderly gentlemen fail of justice. and arithmetic, going about from meeting to nceting, testifying against unprofitable extensions and unintelligible accounts, demanding new committees and audits, and asking questions iwhich nobody wi answer.' But they can no more rouse a' pubic spirit among the shareholders, or get shares up to par, than OLD, MoRTrAzxr could revive the Solemn League and Covenant by scraping the tombstones of its martyrs. Railway shareholders in general are a puny race, very smaU people indeed, only fearful of being crushed- flatter still, and so accustomed to roguery as to trust no promises When any one does present himself to deliver them from the house of bondage they question his mission, and think him only a jobber in disguise. The original shareholders are only seen dimly through a vista of later and more favoured benefiiaries. They are overlaid, overridden, by preference shareholders and debentures. They can only hope for such crumbs as fall from the table of the railway DivEs when the higher guests have eaten and are full. However, somepeople'of eccentric benevolence are trying to breathe a soul under the ribs of death, and wlake up even the British shareholder, the Celt of that community, to vindicate his rights. It becomes one to speak very diffidently of any project where money, numbers, and tweakness are on one side, and cupidity, cunning, and combination on the other. We should distrust any project whatever for the self-defance of sheep against wolycs. - Yet, they say of the human flock that " union is force," and, as uion' has not yet been tried in this instanAe, perhaps it may do something. There is only the old difflculty,-the difficulty that deprives Government of sound commercial advisers and servants. If a man has a head he can turn it to better account than drudging for the State, and we hardly see how the Association for Railway Reform will get honest and able men to do the work they have cut out for them. But let it be tried. Mr. MALws is no enthusiast, no idle declaimer. He does not harp about the past. "Its of no use to cry over spilt "milk ;" so he says,' generally, our present grievance is not unprofitable extensions. They are made, or nearly made, and there is an end of it. Nor does he encourage a hope of ever closing the capital account. That financial sore is kept ever running by debentures lapsing and being renewed on various terms, according to the state of the Money-market. The Working of railways is the clief point-nearly the whole, indeed-now to be attended to. On this point the facts mentioned at the meeting are portentous. Witlh the present number of trains, it is quite evident that thousands of miles of railway are workled at a loss. " On "January 1, 1846," says lMSr. MdIMis, "the "capital invested in the rolling stock of the "London and North-western Railway was "851,4421., and the net earnings of the year "1846 were 1,197,8391. The numberof engines "employed was 220. On January 1, 1855, the "capital so invested was 2,404,7281. The net -"earnings were only 931,9611., although there "Were three times as many engmies-viz., 653. "So that by tripling the engines the net revenue " had been reduced 265,8781." This excessive number of locomotives indicates, of course, a like excess in servants, coke, wear and tear of permanent way, and aU other expenses. But, as things nowi are, in the case of each company it is a matter of necessity. Most places, especially in the Midland, 1Jastern, and Northern parts of this island, can be reached from the metropolis by two or more lines, tvhile the cross-communications are almost equaly fedmundant. If there are five trains by one line, there must be as many by the other, so the companies are starving one another by rival trains as muich as they did by rival lines. It will be the object of the Railway Reform, Association to induce rival companies to give up injurious competition, and run only such trains as shaU pay the slhareholders. The public, of course, Will have a voice in the matter, but the railway proportion of the public is nmmerous enough to deserve some consideration, and the rutin of a hundred thousand families is rather too much to pay for the luxury of a train every hour in the day. Mr. MIuxsS very modestly puts 4 per cent. as a fair remuneration for the shareholders, and he asks that a sufficient sum for this purpose may be entered in the balance-sheet, like the iterms for servants, permanent way, &c., and that the trains and fares be adjusted accordingly. The Association may or may not succeed, but it is qttite certain that in no other way will the shareholders ever get the 4 per cent. to which a long period of adversity has reduced their ambition. By a national agitation they can compel on the directors a uniform system of accounts, divested of that mystery in which directors have hitherto shrouded their boldest strokes of policy. What they have chiefly to do, however, is to extinguish that suicidal rivalry by wlhich the shareholders of every railway in the kingdom are cutting the throats of the rest. You are alvays told when you remonstrate against unprofitable extensions that if one company wil not push olut a branch to appropriate a district, another will, and that a company which refuses to join the mad struggle will soon find its territory reduced to the width of its own rail. In fact, as things now are, it is a battle for existence. Now, if the Association, having obtained sufficient support, can come to some understanding as to the division of territory, or an arbitration for this purpose, they can at once interdict the encroachments of one company into the district of another, and, what is more to the present purpose, compel a fair arrangement of trains. But the mere fact of a committee en pernianience is a new and promising feature., Up to this time the directions have enjoyed stability and permanence enollgh, while the opposition has been brought together on the spur of the moment, new to its work, and feeling its way at every step. Such a standing committee as that appointed at the London Tavern on Tuesday will be better able- to cope with an enemy in possession than the guerilla bands hitherto employed to harass directors; . It is notorious that the standing committee, the standing members of a -committee,4the standing body everywheie, like the standinge army,.willahvays beat the rest. If Parliament will ever listen to 'any' body on the subject;-if it will ever apply aniy other.,principle -to railways than Sir RonBET PI's idea of free trade,-and if it wil ever adopt'any other theory of legislation than- that of.- a' mere compromise between conflicting suitors, this -Association will have some influence with it, as it indeed deserves to have;. but to obtain that influ6noe it must be supported by every shareholder who not only wishes for 4 per cent. but would rescue: his 2 per cent, from furt3ier depeiation.
The cawse of Jo30 3cJsb2, the paw'ibroker of I)oncaster, has been referred, .upon petition, to the Quxs. That pefition is now before uis. We must not, of cou'rse3 assume t6 ourselves the prerogative of decision upon an ex pate statement such as this, but yet enough is theremn disclosed to warrant us in giving all the publicity iu our power to the allegations of the petitio ::If what this -man avers be true, it follows, not ornly that the Qtxx-s's pardon as a matter of course mnst be extended to the petitionfer, -but that we are bOunad to examine a little mnore closely into tlre -adminimi tration of justice at' Quarter Sessions than has hitherto beer done. 3ither IIr. JoM JACX sOw' is innocent and MEr. wnILLIAM Ov3;D the Chairman of the Quarter Sessions at Shef. field, is guilty-the one of participation intheft, the other of abuse of power,-or Mrn; WnI3r OVZRI&'D is inmocent and -Mr. Join JAucKsoc is guilty. The main question turns entirely upon the substantial truth of the evidence, but, even if this be decided against the prisoner, it 'will yet remain to be considered whether or no the Chairman of the Sheffield Quarter Se&z sions conducted the trial in such a manner aA would satisfy the public that substantial justice was done. The statements contained in the petitiori are as follows:- A vroman nameed CH".oIE Coi.ars on the Gth of October last presented herself at JAcKsoN`s. shop at Doncaster, and offered to his wife a gold. diamond ring in pledge. JACKSON was in the shop, at the time, but was employe-a in other business. -e was not immediately engaged in the transaction with the woman Coi=s, but wrote oua the pawn-. ticket, upon the comminticationi he received from' his wife. The ring was then placed in the drawer' with other pledged rings. On the 11th of th¢e same month a man named awnILA WvArS, foreman to one FAXIIEB, a jeweller at Doncaster, called. at JAcxsox's shop, and inquired of him whether, a gold diamond ring had been left w"ith him ina 'pledge. JAcKsoN replied that he did not know,; but he would make inquiry. A conmnunication of the same kind was made to JAtcKsoN's fcreman at. the shop of FARER, the goldsmith, and, as TAu-- sox says, when he came to talk the matter over with his wife,' she exclaimed, "'Why, surelv it " can't be the ring I took in on Saturday ?s. He answered, " What ring" w-hereupon they: searched the ring drawer, and there found the' ring which CirEAuw CoLLrns had pledged. On' tlle 13th of the same month FARxR came to, JACKSON'S shop, and was asked by him to whona the missing ring belonged. FAmRxR replied thathe did not know, but that he had been asLed'tomake inquiries by Mr. BirsrT=, a winemerchantat Doncaster. On the 23d of the same month there was a meeting at MIr. Bxxru&v's house. In' adcition to BENLEY and JACKSoNx, there was present one RoBnuT Covu-A, clerk to MIr. WmLrAr Tlhortp, a soliEcitor, who came to prosecute in- quiries about the, missing ring. -JAcKSoN asked - CouwxA to describe the suspected woman, and his description talled pretty nearly with the descrip- - tion given by Mrs. JAc:soN to her husband of theh. woman who had pledged the ring. CoumTiA was: next asLed to describe the ring. He did so with: sufficient exactness, and the ring was produced,' MIr. JAcKsoNexpressing at the same time his de-' sire that it should be restored to the right owner.. Coui-w aslked if he might be permitted to take. the ring away with him to show it to MIrs. Tnor,r, his employer's wife? The ring was handed over to him at once for that purpose. lfirs. ThonRp was unable to identify it, and thereupon an impression. of it was taken in wax, to be forwarded to Mr. TnRonr, who was then, absent in London, and the ring was returned to JACKSON. The end of all this was, that on the 3d of November Mr. THoRP called at JAcxsoN's shop wuith a constable, and the pawnbrokler immediately deli-: vered over the ring into the officer's hands. The next day the woman CHA.LOTTE Coars was ap-- prehended with the pawn-ticket for the ring in' her possession, and also a dessert-knife belonging - to DMiss VANx, M1r. THorn.'s'sister-in-law. JAcxsoN; and his wife were summoned as witnesses at the examination before the magistrate. There appears to have occurred an angry altercation between Sir' ISAAC MoaRLEu, the magistrate, and JACKSOX, the. pawnbroker, which resulted in an addition to the depositions of a note to the effect that JACoSoN had behaved himself with great insolence at the preliminary examination. And here commences the great grievance of which the petitioner complains. In place of reprimanding him the Court-that is to say, MIr. WisAr OvE,at- - END, surgeon of Sheffield, ordered him to be taken into custody. A bill of indictment against JAcKsoN for having received the ring, knowing it to be stolen, was preferred before the Grand Jury, and returned by them as a true bill in the course. of the same afternoon. He at once, through. counsel, moved the Court that his trial might be postponed until next session, that he might have the power of summoning his witnesses, and preparing his answer to the case. The application was refused. Mis next request was that he might )e. admitted to bail until the next day, to prepare himself for trial. This application was equally set aside. The material w"itnesses for the defence were absent, but there was no help for it. M1r. JACKSON was compelled, vithout witnesses, without brief for counsel, to prepare hiniself for the exigencies of MIr. WiLmaai OvEnEue, surgeon of Sheffield. That great magistrate was resolved on trying the case himself; for, as it appears, according to the regular routine of the Qiiarter Sessions, it should have been tried at a second court. MIr. OvEs-ND, however, inquiredof theDeputy-Clerk - of the Peace if he-hehimself, Mr. OvEREND-could legally try the prisoner,and, on his sfflrmativereply,determinedcto proceed wvith the trial. Theprincipal wituess against JACKSON was, of course, CAiOrro= CoLLsS, the charwoman who had pledged the ring. The prisoner did not Inow at the tiue what has since been well ascertained-that this respectable. individual was suffering under the slight taint of a previous conviction for felony. There was nothing to be done, however. OvERxND, the surgeon, was acting as chairman, and upon the bench sat MRo , aiding him in his dispensation of equal justice to the QuEEN's subjects. The jury could not, despite of a perempLory charge from OvEzEND, be brought to an agreement, whereupon he informed thenm that, unless they cocld make up their minds in an hour, they would be locked ulp all night. Under this gentle pressure they brought in a verdict of (thiTht, and JACKSON was immediately sentenced to confinement in the House of Correction at Wakefield, -with hard labour, for twelve months. He complains that no reasonable time or oppor- - tumity was allowed hin for meeting the charge; that he had no means of inquiring into the character - or previous history of CHMaoT= CoL s-; that neither he nor his wife was admitted to contradict -the evidence of the thief against whom they hal. been witnesses; that he was iried by the jury which had heard the order 'for his prosecution.; -aud other enormities of the like ind. It is not,: 'of course, for us to determine the questions of fact: contained in this statement, but if half of them:. be true it would be of great service to the coantry if the unprofessional chairmen of Quarter Session3 were summarily dismnissed to the more tranquilR regions of domestic life, and debared from all; further vexation of the QuE ;'s subjects. = , ; .. . t t t~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~2

181cOND EDITION. - THE TIAffS OFFICE, TViersday 02Iloing. EXPRESS FROM PARIS. - . 'T-Ii following is the letter of our Paris corre*nondent, dated yesterday, 6 p.m. :- From the telegraphic despatches received to-day it- might be inferred that the acceptance by Rwsia -cf the: Austrian conditions of peace is hardly so' "epire and simple," so unconditional, as was at fist suppoerd. The Joutrna(el de St. 'etersbourg, for instance, expresses a hope that Russia will be entitled to consideration for not having "arrested the -work of conciliation by accessary negotiations." _Again, a despatch from Berlin speaks of a circular from A. deNesselrode to M. Budberg, in wlieh the. Russian Minister expIains to his agents " the motives for the acceptance of the propositions of Austria, and explains his intentions relative to future negotiations," and the remark on this is that " the hopes of peace have lost thereby a little of their force ;" and, lastly, the Joziud7a de- St. Peters6ourg "hopes that Europe will show itself grateful for the moderation exhibited by Russia." 1 r agi aware that it would be wrong to attach much importance or implicit credit to telegraphic mesages containing mutilated sentences from the newspapers. But if they are substantially correct, they would justify a suspicion that some attempt at -trickeryis meant, though I have no doubt that the :French and English Governments are fully prepared for all emergencies, and are carefully on the watch adgainst treachery. I have not seenM. deNesselrode's -circular, but I think it is not difficult to state, with-6ut its heIp, the "motives forthe moderation of Russia." Russia has signified her intention to ae-cept ozr conditions of peace becau3se she cannot help herself. She has been driven tb the verge of ruin by the war, and the fact is admnitted by Russians themselves, who literally shed tgars over the humiliation whiclh has fallen on their country, and which she has no choice but to bear. Russia accepts peace simpIy because she cannot carry on the war, and because she hopes wvith the help of her ally (Prussia) to maake the best bargain she canutnder the circiumstances. If the effortsthat are now made to introduce that Power into the con- ferences be successful, the shame will be as great asis the impudence which can advocate or justify such -an intrusion. A good deal of sentiment will, no -doubt, be expended in favour of Russia, and much argument employed on the cruelty of humiliating so interesting a Polver. But when didRussia ever spare from humiliation a State on -which her grasp was laid? For vwhom or for what, in her long career of tyannyand crime, his she ever shown tenderness or mercy? No weakness has ever disarmed her wrath, no innocence her cruelty, no helplessness her brute force. Wel have extracted the talons froni one of the monster's paws; it is a pity -we cannot do the same by the other. If it be decided that Cronstadt is not to follow the fate of 'Sebastopol, at least let us take care that it shall not be dangerous. We have had some trouble in thro*ving the nmonster on the ground ; we have onr hand on his throat, and if we loosen the gripe till he is powerless for mischief the fault is our own. A friend at Bucharest, who occasionally -vrites to me, accompanies a recent letter with a long list, salicient to fill several of yoiur columns, of the ontrages committed by the Croats in the Principalities. These statements are to a certain extent drawn from official sources, and if they can be -ofedited it would be difficult to find even in the worst Lays of the middle ages acts of more intolerable tyranny than those which afflict that unfortunate country,'delivered over as it is by the apathy of the Porte to foreign occupation. The condition of the Principalities will no doubt form one of the principal -ssubjects of 'the deliberations of the Western Powers during the approaching -conferences. They cannot abandon to its fate- a people whose -elhief offence appears3to J.aave. been their adhe- sion to the cause of the alliance against Russia, and their fidelity to the Sultan. We cannot forget that the ?foldo-WiVallchians have ulp to the last momenit resisted the perfidiouis councils wlhich lurged them to - separate themselves from Turkey, and they them- selves appear to feel that the independence contemplated for them is but an instrumient of isolation -or of servitude. Tneir powverful neigghbours are tbo wel habituated to partition; the political crimes prepared by cunning and consiumnated by force, -contrary to the rights of nations, can harcUy be repeated; they have occasioned too much evil in E Europe by the community of interests they have -created between the tin-ee Powvers wlho despoiled Poland of her national existence. In making use of the Principalities as a bait to win over Germany zgainst Russia, might not some preservatives have been stipulated. If the Austrian occupation has been p6rmitted, what necessity was there to maintain, for instance, a man so universally detested as Prince Stirbey- in power, when the origin of his elevation is remnimbered, and when his charge no longer exists, since the term of seven yearsfixed bythe Convention' of Balta Lifnan and the firman of nomination has, according to the Ottonman calendar, already expired9 The weakness, the apathy, or the corruption of the Porte can no longer be alleged in excuse of a denial ef the justice of the rights of the Moldo-Wallachian population. If the Porte will not or cannot fulfil its dIuty towards its subjects-if it has lost all sense of dignity and of its sovereignty by the prolongation -of suclh a state of things-others who can do so ought to t.ake the matter into their hands. " It is not a sufficient argument," observes the letter alluded to, "To pretend that you should offend Gelmany by entrcating her to exercise moderation in the Principalities. A proper sense of dignity and self-respect is not inconsistent with politedess. We can understand the Austrian occupa tion as people will believe that it is useful, but surely it is no crime to ask that it be organized in a proper manner. I can even undertand that the cvil administration should etercise every vigilance in satisfying the requirements of -the Austrian army, and should have a certain weight with the Government whose states it occupies; but that ad_naistration should have a different person at its head than -one who has been the instrwnent of Russia, and whose syinpathies are known to have undergone little or no change. -She reigning Prince of the Principalities should be above the sVpicion of corption, and should not be the systematic -contemner of the legitimate authority of his suzerain. "c WVhat is meant by the statement, so often repeated, .that the condition of the Principalities uwill be taken into ,consideration when peace is made, ald that, till then, they must resign themselves to remain as they are? If generalor raUzation is meant, it can easily be understood, though the term Peace is very vague and not well defined. But, if merely the personne of the Administration be intended, there can ext no plausible motive for adjournment. you may as well tell A hungry man thlat he. shall have no food ti peace is made ! The farce 7asts too long. Common sense must tell us that the maintenance of an Administra. -tion li}-ethat bywhichthis countryhas been so longoppressed and hunnlliated is not for the mere purpose of torturing an inoflensive people. It is high time for the Allies to demand {e.qplantionsofthePo?teastoitsmotives in notputtinganend so4such a state ofthing;, andto anauthoritywhichshouldhAw. termnated with the domination of the Russians, its projeCtors. Wehope that if the demand be made the explanations of the Porte on a subject of sieh vital importance tons will 1, commaunicated to the English Parliament, in order that -tlie country may be enabled to form a just opinion on what -we have yet to hope from the Ottoman Government,. and w,vhether it still retains a sense of independence and, .dgSnity." The condition of the Principalities will necessarily have a great claitn on the attention of the allies, -when the moment comes for the settlement of the ,ffairs of Turkley. The question is one of great importance. The iratfii^ announces that Vice-Admiral Tr6- houart will leave Paris to-morrow for Toulon, where tho greater number of the cships composing the Mediterranean squadron are now- assembled. 31. Trehouart is to hoist his flag on the screwvship_ Bretagne, which has been ordered to proceed fromn Brest to Toulon.- The Baltic division, commanded by Rtear_Admfral Penaud, is to remain at Brest. The ship of the lino Jena and the steam frigate Darien arrived at Toulon, from the Black Sea, on the 22d inst. The Obseir-ateur de la Corse announces that an English brig, laden with forage, and proceeding to the Crimea, was wrecked on the 13th inst. off Macinaggio. Only tw-o of the 11 men who formed the crewv of the vessel were saved. Atelegraphia despatch, of the 22d inst., announces that the two English war corvettes which had re-entered the Baltic had again left it, and returned into the North Sea. The second daughter of the Duchess of Rianzares (Mari3 Christina) was married this morning to an Italian, the Prince Drago-rather a formidable name. The ceremony took place at 10 o'clock at MIalmaison. Among the Spaniards present were the ex-MIinisters Sartorius and Domenech-par n4bil.e fratncm-Bravo Murillo,and some others of the same party. It was remarked that General Narvaez was not present. Marshal Magnan and some other, French notabilities attended on the occasion. At the performance of I Puritani at the Italian opera last night the fine dzto, Saoni la Tromba, was received with the greatest applause, and was repeatedly renewed at the words SE idando- libeife. The performers had to make their appearance a second time on the stage, after having been encored in the passage. The Prefect of Police has ordered the establishment of a butcher, named Petit, residing rue du Roi de Sicile, No. 47, to be closed, tihat individual having been sentenced by the Imperial Court of Paris, on the 26th nit., to 10 months' imprisonment and 50 francs fine, for the sale of unwholesome meat to soldiers of the Caserne Napoleon. The decree of the Prefect was carried into execution onthe 15th inst. Petit is, moreover, prohibited from exercisimg hereafter the butcher's trade. The two hotels in rue dii Faubourg St. Honore, formerly occupied by the Ambassador and Consul of Russia, are now undergoing repairs. The Emperor and the Empress received yesterday the Prince and Princess of Capita, wnth their children, the Prince Francesco and the Princess Vittoria de Bourbon. The Emperor yesterday received the reply of the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar to the letters of credence of the Viscount des MIeloizes-Fresnoy, as French Minister Plenipotentiary at the Grand Ducal Court. We read in the Moniteur- " The President of the Republic of San Salvador has just charged its representative at Paris to offer his most cordial congratulations to the French Government on the takdng of Sebastopol, and to state that that great event had caused a feeling of admiration as well as an expression of great delight in the state of San Salvador."' The Courrien dt-Harre says,- : "W e are assured that an order transmitted from Paris this afternoon (Tuesday) has directed that the loading of the vessels intended for the Crimea shall be provisionally suspended." lWe read in the Journal dre Havre:- " Every one has heard of the Grand Council of War held at the Palace of the Tuileries, and the names of all its members h.ave beei published. It is in the Council-room, forming part of the apartments of. the Emperor, that the sittings have taken place.

Only those persons who have an opportunity of perusing the numerous official documents and despatches which are exchanged between the foreign Ministers in this city and their resplective Governments can form a perfectly correct idea of the exact situation of affairs; but the sutbjoined account of what is now doing in the diplomatic world will hardly be far from the truth. In the Austrian despatch of the 16th of December, which accompanied the propositions presented by Count Valentine Esterhazy to Count de Nesselrode on the 28th df the sam e month, the following sentences oCcar:t- ,. . "The signature of these preliminaries would be inimmediat'ely followed by a general armistice and definitive negotiations. As our work (the propositions) has been honoured by the approval of His MIajesty, you are commissioned, Count, to present it to the Court of Russia for acceptance, and earnestly to intreat the same to take it into serious con- sideration, and to communicate to us, as soon as possible, it; determination. If, as we hope, our proposals should meet with a favourable reception, we wi hasten to urge their acceptance on the Courts of Paris and London, &c." In a letter written three days since- it was hinted that the Western Governments would perhaps do well to learn the intentions of Russia relative to Kars before they signed- the preliminaries of peace, and you may believe that there was good reason for my so doing. In their counter-propositions, the astute Russians laid a trap for their opponents, and, the latter appear to have fallen into it. When the counter-propositions were rejected, it should have been remarked that- the re,stitution of Kars to its former owners would, in virtue of Article 5, be insisted on. As things now stand, the restitution. of the pashalic eud fortress of Karsis an!open questiom. Yesterday it was reported in the city -that E'ngland was dissatisfied with what had been done, and it appear- to me very natural tthat such should be the case. Is a 3lip. of the Bessarabian territory to be considered an equivalent for Kinburn,- Eupatoria, South Sebastopol, Kamiesch, Balaldava, Kertch, and Yenikale. - It is continually diined into my ears, that France fuRly agrees with Austriain thinking that Russia " ought to be allowed to retain al her means of defence," which diplomatic phrase means, that North Sebastopol is to remain in stahti quo, and that the Caucasus is again to be cut off from conrmunion with the western world by mreans of a chain of Russian forts. England has been prodigal -of blood and treasiire during thli| last two years, but, strange to say, the propositions of the Allies do not even 'touch on that part of the Eastern question which relates to Asiatic Turkey., This Government is so fanatically inclined to peace that the foregoing remarks wiU notbe taken in good part here, but it is my duty to represent things in their true light. nThe Tives of January 17 has just come to hand, and in its first leader is the following sentence " It is very difficult to understand at the present moment the real position of Austria. On the one hand we are told that, at the very moment when she rejected the counter. propositions of Russia, she declared her intention not to g3 to war, while on the other, we learn from a semi-official French journal, that Austria has been trusted with the conduct of the negotiations, because, in the event of their proving unsuccerSsfel, she is determined to throw in her lot with the Western Powers, and to abide with them the fortuuie of war."1 The policy of Austria has, from the very outbreak of the war, been'a policy of "demonstralions," and Le Nord was probably right in saying, that Austria would not place herself in the line of battle this year, but it was certainly wrong when it stated that Count Buol had officialy communicated the fact to the Western Powers. There is, however, reason to believe that aconfidential communication was made to France, if not to England, that Austria would be unable to place her armies on a full war-footing before the year was far advanced. There is negative information of unusual imnaortance to be given. The prevalent report that the Generals of the hostile armies have received telegraphic orders to suspend hostilities is false. It would be contrary to aUl diplomatic usage to issue such orders before the preliminaries of peace have been signed, and that they wil hardly reach this city before the 23d inst. you learned by my letter of yesterday. It is credibly related that neither the British nor French Minister at this Court has yet received from his Government powers authorizing. him to sign the preliminaries. The seat of the I future Peace Congress is not yet fixed on, but some out-of-the-way place is likely to be chosen, where the diplornatists wiU find good food and lodging, and no-. thing to distract their attention from their important duties. Le Ao;d remarks that there was no trace of the style of an 0llimatim. in Count Buol's de-' spatch of the 16th of December, and the observation is perfectly just, but Count Esterhazy had instrulctions to employ-should it be necessary-very posi. tive language on or about the 4th or 5th of January. The telegraphic order sent to Count Esterhazy to quit St. Petersburg on the 17th gave the character of an ulftinaUstz to tlle zAustrian propositions-' Yesterday Count Stackelberg presented a letter from the Czar to the Emperor Francis Joseph. Last night there was a ball at the house of Prince Bibesco, the ex-Hospodar of Wallachia, and it was observed that there was a great rapprochie7nent between the members -of the French and Russian Embassies. Prince Gortschakoff was not present; Count Stackel1prg, the military member of the Russtan Embassy, looks 10 or 15 years older than he, did before he made his trip to the Crimea. The Cracow C,as gives the following account of the state of Prince Pnsktiwitsch's health:- "There can no longer be a doubt as to the complaint under . which Prince Paskl.witsch suffers. The cancer may be | plainly felt -through the abdomen of the cmaciated patient 'who is so weak that he cannot turn in bed without assist2- | ance. he is magnetized by Baron Kloz, and it affords himn somelittlealleviation. Ilisdeathis expected fromhourto hour. It is not yet settled who is to be his successor."" I Tihe Vienna Presse, which, by-the-by, is said to be the favourite organ of his Excellency the Chief of the Police, contains a lengthy article on the prospects of peace that closes with the following menace against England, which will probably meet with the full approbation of Mlr. Cobden and men of the like kidney:- If party spirit on the other side of the Channel should again endeavour to baffle the efforts made by Austria to give peace to the world, a cry of indignation would be raised throughout Europe, and it would soon be seen that the most powverful of British Minsters would be unable to oppose the unanimous longing for peace wlhich is felt throughout thi3 quarter of the -world." The W'Viener Zeitutng contains an Imperial Patent, relative to the indemnification for the loss of droits (le corvee, but it can have no interest for the foreign - public. In consequence of the great influx of i patients suffering from the typhus fever to the general hospital, a large house has been rented in the suburb Wieden, and to it those patients who are in the apartments which colTespond with the "Lazarus" and " M eagdalen" wards of St. Bartholomew's are to be removed.

HAMBURG, Jv 22. 1 The arrival of as many as 300 vessels laden with salt and other7necessaries from the various German, Swedish, and Danish ports at Russian liarbours, principally at Revel, Riga, and Baltic Port, is announced in our journals, which mention that the quantity of salt alono has been about 1,500 lasts, reducing the price of that article considerably in con- sequence. It is further stated, however, that very i few ships have been enabled to reach Pussian ports with colonial produce, so much required; that many vessels had taken in cargoes for Cronstadt and St. Petersburg again from these places, but with the questionable probability of'| reaching those harbous, in consequence of the weather havingehanged to hard frost again. On the 15th inst. 20 degrees of Reaumur had been reported to be the state of the barometer in St. Petersburg, which will render it impossible for any vessels to approach the coast. Very large qtantities of corn (chiefly rye) were ready for shipment at Riga, and some vessels laden therewith were frozen-in inthe harbour with - cargoes taken on board for St. Petersburg. - - I The reports from St. Petersburg state that much severe weather had been experienced in the Crimea, and that heavy snows had fallen in the vicinity of SimpheropoL In order to reduce as much as posable the amount of the civil list, the Emperor had given orders that all vacancies occurring in the Imperal Court appointments should, for the future, not be filled up as heretofore, until his orders were made known on the subject. This ukase proves that all due regard is now paid to the strictest economy in the State -expenses. All troops organized from: among the Bashkir tribes are henceforth to be called soldiers of the " army of the Bashkr' The weather continues very mild and rainy here, and steamers have commenced running again. II do not expect, however, that we sha7l experience. this weather long. - We learn from Copenhagen that the day before yesterday the two British war steamers had taken their departue, steering northwar3s.

'Mr. Campe will have' the support of the majority of the press in Germany, as. also of the legal profession, to support his cause against his opponents. The Senate seems ashamed of the. Whole business already. - SPAIX.. (FROM ouni o0 V2 CoRlnESPOr-Dinr.) MADRID, Jar. 18. The news of Russia havng accepted unconditionally' the propositions for, peace was received by the Spanish Government last night, and ivas conimlunicated at once to our Legation here, a chief of the Spanish Foreign-office being the bearer of it. . Lord Howden had a large dinner ancd evening party, several members of the diplomatic body being present, and on the communication of the telegraphic despatch to him his Lordship -immeediately rose and announced it to the assembled guests. It has been the themeof general conversation to-day, havingbeen published in the Gazetke. The &diuwoement of the last Ministerial crisis has not, satisfied the ultraLiberal section of the Coites, and Senor Sagasta, a young member of that party, moved what was tantamount to a vote of censure on the Government, and was so designated by Genelal O'Donnell, who spoke for the first time since his recent illness. It was to the effect that the explanations given the day before, respecting the reconstitution of the Cabinet, were not satisfactory. It wvas rejected by 152 votes against 57. The re-composed Cabinet is considered to be strengthened by the result of this vote. A strong ministerial combination was proposed at one time, and met with influential support; had it taken effect the Duke de la Victoria ivas to continue President of the Council of Ministers, General O'Donnell Minister of War, and Senor Olozaga (Salustiano) would have come in as Minister of Foreign Aftairs; Luziuiaga, for Grace and Justice; Corradi, Home Department; Sanchez Silva, Finance ditto; Liljan, Public Works; and Escosura, Marine. The present Cabinet will probably be siipported by a sufficient majority on politieal questions, and indeed, on all on which it chooses to stake its existtence. The Cortes contmiue to discuss the proposals for schemes of Credit Companies which have been sub- mitted to them. Those of a bot4 fide character will certainly pass. The Government will exact the previous deposit in each case of a sufficient siim, according to the maguitlde of the -undertaking, b;y way of guarantee, which may have the effect of nipping soeni speculative projects in the bud. The chief articles of the report in favour of the Creclit Mobilier proposals, and by which bill the formation. of anonymous credit companies in general will be regulated, have already passed. In addition to the advance of 6,000,00f. to the Government by the representatives of the inew company, as previously mentioned, Mlessrs. O'Shea and Co. deposited yesterday, on behalf of it, 12,000,000 of reals in State railway paper (acciones deferao-car,iles), bearigg 6 per cent. interest, and ordered by law to be taken as security by the Government at its nominal value. The proposals of Senors Servillano, Collado, Moreno, M. Weisweiller, and variouis other' Spanish and foreign firms,.to forma similar companylhaving been reported on favourably, wiUl also probably pass. The capital is to be 300,090,099 of reals, in 100,000 shares of 1,900 reals (500 francs), to be issued in series at the discretion of the board of directors, the first of 54,000 shares, of which 50 per cent. to be paid up. It is to restrict its operations to Spanish business, not making any loans to foreign nations, or having branches there, but only agents or correspondents, and may not buy or sell public funds for time, or buy or lend money on its own shares. When these creditandbank Echemes have been got through, or perhaps simultaneously with them, the bases of the electoral law will be discussed. The Cortes have voted, on the proposition of Senor Gaminde, that all anonymous credit companies shall publish monthly accounts of the state of their affairs. The funds have risen considerably to-day, to which the vote of yesterday in the Cortes has contiibuted, but chiefly, perhaps, the news favourable to peace. The Three per Cents. were done as high as 37 at one time-they closed at 36.50, and the Deferred at 23.15, beiing a rise of 1 per cent. on the former, and ; on the latter.

I (FRoe OmU2 OwT coOlx:7EXlw2xT) B EELn, J tz L The tone of feeiing genRrated. lhere by the news of Russia's ac:ceptance ol the Austrian p.-oposals, to which the King has undo&btedly coo tributed very mucb, in spite of 1i6; own. judgnrent and interests being opposed to the-nature of tlhu propositions themselves, has harmonized. most admirably with the round of festivfiies that now occupies the beau zowde of Berlin.. Last, Thursday morning, at the very time that the pleasing, news . reached' here, the solemn espousals, of the young Princess Louisa of Prnssia, witl the. Prince-Regent of Baden took plase in. all state at the Royal Palace, after which there was a gala dinner, at which the King, who has been far from well for some time, -was enabled to preside.. The espousals had previously taken place in private at Coblenz. On Fridaythe nozreaun fiauis heTd a species of drawing-room at the Prince of Prussia'spalace, for the receipt of the congratulations of theCourt, and on Saturday night the fint of a selies of three subscription balls was given at the Opera-house, at which the King, Queen, and all the Royal family were present, together with the numerous dis- tingauished persons of rank whom the youngP'incess's betrothal has attracted to Berlin. On Sunday morning was the annual ork,Llsfest, or festival at which all the hollers of Prussian orders are invited to a d6je7bner dhnatoire at the Palace, after attending divine service in the new chapel that was opened there a year or two back. Proviously to the commencement of the religious service in the chapel, the very numerous and happy individuals who have had stars, ribands, and crosses conferred on them that day, as well as those wio have received them since last orde7sfest, are' presented to the King, and express to him their thanks for the distinction. A description of the arrangements of the ball at the Opera-house may, perhaps, be permitted a place in your columns. The pit was entirely covered in by a new floor, extending from the level of the Royal box (which, as is cornmon in continental theatres, occupies the centre of the premier tier) to the centre of the stage; from here the floor rose again, and, by the help of scenery, and a plentiful and tastef^ul arrangement of flowers and shrubs, presented the aippearance of a hail supported by columnst wound round wvith flowers, and opening> out into a romantic landscape. All the boxes of the whole house were kept open, and formed the sitting accommodation for such of theguests astook nopart in the ball or promenade. The formbr was opened by the King and Queen, who -walked a polonaise, preceded by the intendant of the Royal Theatre. The King was observed to be more cheerful and debonmaire than he has been for a long time past, and the younger Princes of the Royal family contiibuted fully their share to make the ball pass off well by their affable and cheerful participation in the dance. With the assistance of every imfiaginable species of chandelier and candelabra, the total ilhumination of the house attained the amount of 000 flames, the brilliancy and heat of which may be easily imagined. In conjunction with the theatre, the very elegant concertroom of the Opera-house was opened for the purpose of refection, in addition to the varuious facilities for refreshment erected at the side of the stage. The number of tickets sold was 1,700, of which 200 were taken by the Royal family. '[The expenses of the decorations and other arrangements for the three balls are known already to amomut to 10,000 thalers, which are not likely to be covered by the receipts. The production of a new piece at one of the minor theatres was prevented last week by an appEcation firom the Russian Minister here, who protested agamst a dramatic representation, having for its title M#erely a Souil, and its subject one that turns upon the fates and fortunes of certain Russian serfs. In spite of the piece having been so altered as that a generous Russian Princd is made to interfere, manumit the lovers, and make everybody happy at the end, the interdiction was not wvithdrawn.
THE ZURKISH COTINGELY.T. (FROA A CORESPnNlnfl'r i KEPRTCI, DEC. 29. We are fairly locked in here now. A herd of elephants could promuenade on the ice in the bay, and the strongest parts of the clurrent in the straits are now covered. But here i;. forms and breaks up. A longer continuance of frost will enable us to cross. Report has it that General Wraiugel has been reinforced to a considerable extent at Arabat but whether with the intention of coning on here or crossing the bay is not known. The Tartars have it that he comes on here with 50,000 men, and his brother awaits the formation of the ice to cross wsith 20,000 more. They will both get a warm reception when they lo come. Powerful batteries have been placed on the commanding heigllts and on the seaboard, and the Turkish soldier has proved that he will not yield without a severe struggle. A deep fosse has been dug, and a parapet 12 feet high has been raised all romud the town of Kertch and the defences of St. Paul's and Yenikale, within w hich the troops are all comfortably hutted. Except inthe article of fuel there is agood stock of everything, and, were the ice to break uap at St. Paul's to enable ships to approach, the force would want for nothing. The troops have now lhad their new clothing issued, and look remarkably well. An amazing improvement has taken place in their appearance and it. They have beconme very partial to their new .connandnga ofticers, and, now that so many of them c an conniuiicato with them in their own language, they become quite domesticated one with the other. Many officers have already passed in the language and received the honorary reward for so doing,. Now that the men are all hutted, and the entrenching works near at an end, parades are constant. The other day twogunswere fired and the alarm soiunded. Fancying the enemy were upon us, I instantly pufled on my boots, buckled on miy sword, and rushed out. I found the troops all turned out, and the artillerymen at their guns. It was a false alarm, done possibly to try the troops. They turned out with admirable alacrity. The General is everywhere. He looks generally to the efficiency of his force in all departments. He is most popular wfith all, and deals out justice without fa;vour or affection to any one. WVith our allies the French he is on the best of terms.

. -. - THB ;BAN TR TO TEIE7I lTETjI T E : - -; ; Sri,-Permitme, through yo - f£LwAns, to one more effort to clear away the mistsaxid vFj.ir .which-have been throw'n around the question of Wb BanklCharter Act, -and its effect upon the presefit state of our bullion reserves and of commercial f.r'edit.' The subject is not in itself intricate or obscure; the public lll find it to be. simple and easily wntelligible, if they will only believe it-to lieq co, and wvifl -approach it free from all passionatr feeEngs, and from that impression of mystery whlioh creates the evil it dreads. . The act of 184 -was passed as a conplTcleant t, the act of 1819. Its purpose was trr aeenu effectnuaIy the main. tenance of cash payitnVs, by rendering, the absoIntfexhaiiAtiorij of the W2lion iposs-blie. It had directnR-erence olly to. the -safety of tlVi moanetar systemL B3y its effects in this zspeot the success or failure of the act must be tessd. The effect of the act upon csmdit and spevulatiort is incidental only. Could it even be shown that iBpDroduce"no effeci Dn tfiese, stil the expediency and necessifr of: thle act wouli remain unaltered. 13Bt, no d0ubt, the contraction ef- notes atnbullion is withdrawn does actindirect3, upon*cidit,, speculation, and prices-the extent of the-effects thus produced v-aying according to. other: co;l comitant circumstances. We have a practical illustration of both- these effects of the act, the direct and the indirecteffects,; in the present state of monetaTy affairs. The- store of 'bullion has been effectually- muaintained, notwithstanding a pressure upon, tie exchangies, from various causes, of the severestlchamacter. - And this result has been accompanied by- ar gradual restrictive influence upon credit and specu-, Iation, the utility of which few reasonable persons' will deny, and the connexion of which -with- theuresent safety of our monetary system mustlie )bvious to iall who remember the insecurity of our nonetary system on former occasions, previous.tsr ;he act of 1844, when no such restrictive influence- -s brought into play during the early period of ae Irain of bullion. But, it is said, issues cannot be contracted so long: is bankers are liable to be drawn upon by depo- itors, and are subject to demands from their cus-. 5omers for discount. It is surprising to what an extent a plain and.. 'imple matter may be obscured and mystified by: random assertions couched in ambiguous terms. It might asMellbe asserted that, notwitstandi. the deficiency of the supplies wrhich Providencs mayfursh, tho food of a peole cannot be con-. tracted so long as hunger prevails, and men must;' be fed. The total amount of bank-notes is now made by' law to correspond to the total amount of bulion.. If the amount of bullion is diminished by foreigu: drain,the amonnt of bank-notes is diminished to an; equal extent by law. The aggregate body of bankersin that case can command a less amount of bank-: notes with which to work their business. What,! then, are they to do? Their depositors draw upon them. At first they endeavour to meet these demands from the bank-notes in their till-i. e., from their' banking reserve. But as the total amount of notes issued has beer: diminished in proportion to the drain of bllion, the reserve of each banker, already restricted by thig process, will 'bear no further pressure. Tha approaching exhaustion of this fund vill compel:. theni to resort to other measures, through tvhich they may be' enabled, notwithstandin-r the decrease a in the amount of notes issued, still to meet their7 outstanding liabilitids.'' ' - - ' They Will necessarily proceed to realize their securities, and to contract their credits and their discounts. It is idle to deny the possibility of this; it is what must occur by the very necessity of the case;, it is what has occurred on former occasions, and what again is now in progress, acting most bene-: ficially, because the process commenced early and. has proceeded gradually. B3ut thepresent state of commercial affairs, we are. told,- requires an increased issueof bank-notes. - Let us consider what would be the certain andi immediate effect of such increased issue if. resorted to. The exchanges are at this moment barely main-- tained at par. Bullion is on the point of going out,of the country; indeed, it is still subject to gradall diminution. This affords conclusive proof that our circulation is not too Iiigh in value, and therefore is not deficient in amount when compared with the circulation of other countries. If we now proceed to a further issne of banklnotes, this will at once render our circulation redundant compared with that of other'countries; the exchanges will-be relaxed, and bullion will pass from us to those places-in which there has been no corresponding increase of circulation. This process will go on so long as this additional issue of notes is maintained at the increased' amount. It was by a persistence in this very process that - on occasions of adverse state of exchanges, before thle act of 1844, the bullion was reduced to an alarmfinig extremity. By the act of 1844 a recurrence to this fatal process was rendered impossible; hence the comparative safety of ouir monetary system at this moment, aud the satisfactory state of commercial credit, as contrasted vwith the state in which it was found at former periods of adverse exchaniges and consequent: pressure. Let it be clearly understood that no additional issue of bank-notes can, under present circiunstances, settle down into a real increase of the circulation, ifcash payments are to be maintained. Our monetary condition, stated in round numbers, stands thus:- The issue department holds 10,000,0007. of bullionr and 14,000,0007. of securities, against wvhich it h as issued 24,000,0001. of bank-notes. In this state of things the unsettled state of the exchanges tells uis that the circulation is rather inrexcess than otherwise, compared with that of other countries. Suppose, then, we issue more barn-notes-say 4,000,0007. Bullion will at once begin to leave the country, until the equilibrium between the amount of our circulation and that of other countries is established. We shall then stand thus The isste department will hold X,9000,0001. of bul-: lion, and 18,000,000l. of securities, a<gainst wlicll it will have issued 2X,000,0001. of notes. We -shall 'still remKain with the samne aniomift (24,000,0007.) of notes issued;~ the only differenceT being, that our reserve of bullion wllU have been - diminished, and a corresponding increase will appear' in the amount, of securities. Upon the supposition now under discussion-: niamely, a further inoress&-bf bank-notes under present circumstances-we are inevitably brought into this dilemrma ,-If the increasedamount of circula- - tion be maintained,- the bullion will immedately, leave the country, and a Ansspension of cash -pay-, ments musat ensue. Ef the increased amount of cir- culation be not mnaintained, wfe then revert -to - Out': former position; the advantages anticipated from - an increased amount of ' cireYation' will not have - been obtained, while 2 tr protective reserve of: bullion will harv been seriously dimiihed:.

' - M URDER IN BEDFORD-ROW. The moQued inquest on the death of Mr. Waugh was sumod yterday morning in-the board-room of the workhouse in Gray's-inu-lane. Mr. G. Lewis again appeared to watch the case on behaLf of the prisoner, and Mr. Humi',hreys as solictor for the family of the dceased. llr. T. C. WVhitefield was recalled, and -identified the pri. ,soue Wetron, who had been brought into court, as the wsan whohad fired the shot which kIlled Nr. Waugh_ The prisoner is of very diminutive size, and, like most - Psnipcks, has a very large and peculiarly shaped head. -ihere is nothing in the expression of his face to in'dicate insanity, and little in his manner,which was perIectly calm and self-possessed. He has, howovee, a quick ,Way of turning round to look at what attracts his attention, eund his bearing gavo one the impression that he was indif-, fetent about his position and the crime with which he stands. charged. The witaessesand'strangers in the court showed 'q'uite as much concem about the proceedings as he did. Thomas Hutchins, the streetkeeper of Bedford-row, repeated the evidence which he gave before the magistrate as Jothedeathof Mr. Waugh; andJanes Scott,,zporter, who gave similar testimony, also identified the pistols which yore produced by Sergeant Hayes. This %itness also re*eaed his former evidence. James Loynes, a bootmaker, was next examined as to the circumstances of Mr. Waugh's death, which he saw, being siot more than 41 yards off at the time. Nothing new 'wa glicited by the questions which the coroner put to him. Inspector Checkley, who exhibited a nicely-executed plan, drawn by himself, of the spot where the deceased was killed, like the other witnesses, repeated his evidence before themagistrates. He furtherstated that, afterthe remand, ho went to the prisoner's lodginrgs, 23, Newland-street, Kensington, and there found, among other things, bullets sad a bullet-mould, which exactly fitted, the pistols producedin court He had alsofound a number of documents, bat none of a more recent date thau 1845. The pistols had been purchaseed 15 months ago by the prisoner.from a person named Wilcock, a tobacconist in-the Minories. The price paid for them was one uinea. (They have brass barrels, the handles being inlaid with'metal ornamentation.) The inspector further stated 'that the coUlection of tings at- the prisonersilodgings included an alarniclockl, drawing materials, and fishing taclde.. Tais concluded the evidence, and the. prisoner having been withdra;n, Y r. LIT-is said that it was manifest the prisoner laboured ruder a delusion with respect to Mr. Waugh, for the familrwere most anxious to stae that tha deceased gentle. had always treated him and them with the greatest &indness and consideration. Though tha conduct of the prisoner might appear to be that of. a reasonable man,. capable of assigning, a cause for his actions, it would beshown,before another tribunal thit - his state of mind was astch that he could not be considered a responsible agent. It would be proved that insanity was hereditary inthe family that his father and uncle both- destroyed themselves while insane, and that his aunt h3d died insane in a lunatic asylum.- It would further be shown that theprisoner hadbeen turned out of various lodgings on the ground that-he was mad, and taton oee.occasion he hadthrown open the 'window and set Ere to tho room in orderto destroy the Deivil. -No object would have beent served in addlucing evidenee on these facts In the present stage of the proceedings; but he was ainxious that it should go forth on the-part of the prisoner's family tilst his accusations against- fr. Waugh were entireIy un6ondd, and the result of a delusion. The CoRoNs then addressed the jury, anatold them that Iad eTidence of the prisoner not being a responsible agent been adduced, thoughthey might find a verdict inaccordance therewith, the court had not the power to provide for the safe custody of the prisoner under such circumstances. As proof, however, of the kind had been brought forward on the contrary, it appeared that the prisoner had acted with lhe gmeast premoditatiozi, and under.revengeful feelings of the most determined chanrcter. - It might be proved there. alter that he had beenm actuateda by z delusion which ren. dared him irresponsible for his acts, but if so, he (Mr. Wakley) could only lament thit a man in such a state oE mind should have been allowed to go at large. Persons brought before- police courts and charged with deliberate threats directed against life ought to lose their liberty for so doing. Those, who were the objects of such - threats could - not consider their safety secured by the manner in which eases of thekicnd were now dispoeed.of. ("Hear, hear," from-the iury.) Looking at the evidence before them, the jury could, in his opinion, return Only one verdict on the death: of Mr. Waugh, and tl2at was a finding of " Wilful murder against C. Broadfoot West-on." - - The jury unanimously, and without delay, returned a verdict to that efrect, and the proceedings,terminatedL At the termination of the inqaest thejury expressed them. selves warmly in approbation of the assiduity and discretion of Inspector Checkley, of the E divisionof police, who, in conjunction vwith the summoning officer Stripling, had ererted himself so as to procure for the purpose of the inqiiry a large amount of evidence.' The jury also unani. Dously agreed to address the following memorial of thanks to the Right Hon. Sir George Grey, M.P, Her Majesty's Sccretary of State for the Home Department:- " The jury empannelled to inquire into the cause of the death of Goorge waugh desire to express to Sir George Grey their sincerethanks for his havingexercised his authority and caused Charles Broadfoot Westron to be brought before them at the adiourned inquest-a circumstance which has enabled them to terminate their inquiry in conformity with the evidence and with their oaths.'f This was signed by the foremaui, Mr. Churchwarden I'estzson, and by the rest of the 15 jnrymen empannelled, Yesterday the prisoner was examined on remand'at Clerkenwell Police-court: Mr. Humphreys, in opening the case, said he appeared for the prosecution, insucted by the executors to the late lfir. Waugh. It vwould be in the recollection of the Court that the prisoner was bound over to keep the peace, he bavingsent threatening letters to Mr. ;Wauh in October 13st. That inquiry was beard- before Mr. orrie, and the -prisoner ws bound over to keep thEe peace towards the deceased. That inquiry was in consequence of a letter hich the prisoner had sent to MEr. Waugh, and of which -the follo-igis a copy:-- i "Sir,-Yon have been told by me, over and ove'r again, -that I will7not sanction [on my own behalf (i.e.) you say I 4an do nothing] rr.

I TH MINISTRY OF WAR. TO THE EIITOit OF TH E8.- - Sir,-When this country, nearly two years ago, to use the expressive phrase of the Earl of Aberdeen, "drifted into war, " it was at once perceived -byevery person of average intelligence that the official machinery for-carrying on a great European struggle was hopelessly inefficient. At that time the, division, of responsibility and the distribution of duties among the various miMtary authoritiesv was of such, a character as to render the transaction of the ordinary routine business of the military departments extremely difficult and dilatory, even-in time of peace. The military resources of the country were wielded by a variety of functionaries, the sphere of -whose duties was ill-defined, and whose capacity for combined action might reasonably be questioned. The employment of the arny and the direction of its operations in the field belonged to tho'Secretary of State for War and Colonies; its government-and. its discipline were vested in the Comnuander-inChief acting immediately under the Crown; while all questions of finance, recruitment, and eiducation vrere in the province of the Secretary War.' - To the M'aster-tieneral of the Ordnance belouged the supervision of the Artillery ahd Engi control of the great arsenals, f6rtres' ract and a variety of other incongruous matters, 'hich it would be tedious to. enumerate.. At the same time, the militia, which in time-of. war must bo looked upon as a part of our means of offence and defence, wras under a totally. different .authority; for the details of business the authorities of the Horse Guards were consulted, but the militia was in tall other respects subject to the authority of the Secre tary of State for the Home Department. Thbus, the country possessed five different authorities, .each performing to a certain extent the functions-of a 3inister of War, but no one of them invsted with sufficient powers to be able to direct effi'ciently his own department, or to be of use to'the country in a difficuIt emergency. Pablic ophiion, withitscertaininstinct, demaidea an i'inediate reform of a system, so obviously defective, and which, if persevered in, could only insunre great national disaster. The Governmentr of t.he. day at once accepted a verdict of which the justice; coulld not be disputed, and'vwhici ;was certainly not given in any factions or hostile spirit. The Ministerd therefore consented. to enact and inhodice thos'e changes which the public interests seemed to require. A Idinistry of War was created, the independent authority of the Ordnance was abolished, and :the Secretary at War was placed in a very subordinate position. ' '-' Bult the great State offlce of Conmmander-in-Chief was retained, and it was not decidedunder which'of the departments the militia was to be placed. Tt ' was hoped-at least it was said so-that the Coammander-in-Chief would be -able -to co-operate with the War.Minister, to assist him with advice, and to relieve him from the labour of considering the petty details of military routine. But it was impossible that an arrangement of this kind could be successful. Two high functionaries-7the one & civilian, the other asoldier-were established, necessrilyin a state of perpetual rivalry. Each of them is ' supposed to act directly under the Crown, each of 'them having a great position asfar as public opinionis concerned, but with very different classes, for the ci'vilWar Minister is immediately responsible to Parliament, while the Commander-in-Chief is stroug in the feeling of the military profession, partly from beinng a distinguished soldier, and partly from being the instrument through which theQueen'swishes or congratulations are addressed to the army. As might have-been anticipated,the changeswhich. have taken place have not been sufficient to provide a good and effective military administration. It is well known that there is no end to the jealousies and difficulties between the new Ministry of War ; and the oldilorse Guards, and it is no less wellknown that under the new rigimne there has frequently been' delay most injurious to the public interests, and a waste of means and resources unparalleled even in the annals of the classic jobbing of the Peninsular war. Perhaps, under the existing system, nothing has been done that can justly be compared with the outrageous absurdities of the Duke of Newcastle and. Mr. Sidney Herbert's times, when those two panic-stricken officials dayafter dayissued orders for fresh supplies of winter clothing for the army in the Crimea, without any knowledge of what had been or was being done by the other departments; but any one at all conversant with the public economy of the country must admit that there has been and still is going on a most profligate and wasteful expenditure-that our military system has not been brought to that pitch of excellence which ought to belong to the establishments of this country,-in a word, that vast resources are being lavished without anything like commensurate results. - - The present state of our military administration creates the most profound dissatisfaction, not only with those who take what is called the,vugarmoneyview of the question, but with every man who desires the success of his countrymen and who feels for their honour. Civilians, whose criticism is sneered at by miiitary dogmatists, have as high an interest in, and feel as strongly for, the credit of ourarms as any of their red-coated brethren; and I believe that there is no real soldier, with his heart in his profession, who is not grateful to them for their efforts to improve the condition and the government of the British army. Military reform is the interest of the country, but to every true soldier it is of individual as well as general importance.- Of late a variety of propositions have been put forward on this subject, many of them, it is true, crude and ill-considered, but many which contain useful and valuable suggestions. The main question, however, of military reform must be the question of the government of the army. - Now, the first condition of the good government of a great branch of the public service is concentrated authority and undivided responsibility. It is clear that these advantages can only beattained by establishing the complete supremacy of one authority over the other. The practice of this country in other things would naturally suggest that the Secretary of State for War should have the whole undivided control of the army and of every-' thing appert4ining to it. The public interest-requires that the inister chargedwith those duties should be immediately responsible to Parliamentf; that explanations, when required, should be givn which the whole of the Cabinet would have to defend, and that there should be no part of the public service virtualy irresponsible, as is now the case, and practically conducted by old War-office clerks under the name of Royal prerogative. It is said, however, that great objections are entertained to such a change in very high quarters. It is asserted-I know not with what accuracy-that thereis a great unwillingnessto have what is called a Parliamentary instead of a 1oyal army; and on 'this subject much virtuous indination is expressed by il-informed old ladies of both sexes. The story probably emanates from some of the hangers-on at the Horse Guards, who -have a direct personal interest in maintaining the existing state of things.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I have to request thatyouwillallow me to say afew words in reply to the letter of xr. Harrop, clerk to the Manchester Board of Guardians, which appeard in The 2Times of the L9th inst. I do not propose to trouble you' agpin in this niatter. I was fally warranted insaying that pauper children were detalned by hundreds at the Manchester workhouses as I' connted, on the 17th of September, 15Q chiadren present at the eomination in tho Matncheiber workhouse, and 139 chb1dreu present in the' Canal-stiest workdhouse on the 20th ofllTovemb Last. On both occasibns I was informed that' several children were'absent from sicki4cssfor other causes. Thejeg;th of time during vhich childrenuhave been detained at the Manchester 'workhouse3' can be proved from the' admission and discharge books keptat each. I must maintain that the Swinton schools were built to be used, anid that the reasons aUeged for niot fully using them are insuffident. I have been iniforied that London gnardAns act very differently. I desuc that pauper children shoild bs as well taught during school hours as tin and circumstances permit, and I amnunahlceto understand what there is unreasonable in this object. Good.instroction in school cannot interfere with nustrial trairing oiit of it intheslightest degree. - * I E education is to effectreal goodit must obviously extend far enough to make a lasting impresson on the character I apprehend that'thispointis nof often attained, and strike3 and their disastrous Oons'renis may be taken as some' proof that much yet remans to be done in the manufac.- turing districts. __I am, Sir, your obedient servant, 'X.

PEACE ADI) BnAD3SuFrs.-Although we ran the risk of being ridiculed, even by.manyweU-informed peros, for advocating the continuance of high prices for gi, in the event of peace being established, we should not consider. that we had performed our duty if we did not express our. convictions, and state our reasons for arriing at t conelusion. Looking at the present state of the corn markets in these kingdoms, as wel as of the continent, we find that an unusualy low stock of grain prevails. Referring to the annual'cirlar of M1r. Thomas Carr, of Rostock -which we published some weeks since in dur 'journal, and the information and opinions in which have frequently been corro- boratedy subsequent results, we find that the stocks in' France of all sorts of grain are unusually limited. In Belgium, the Rhine, and olandi equally so. In the German States, particularly so. In Turkey, Wallachia, Hungary, andMoldavia,muchbelowanaverage. InEgypt,lessthan' last year. In Spain, very moderate, and the capabilities of export insignificant. InRussiaand Poland stocL-s are also,very small, except in the neighbourhood of the southernRussian ports; such as Kertch, Taganrog, Marionpol, and,. Berdian.k, but it is supposed that a large portion of these stocks has already been destroyed by the Russians themselves, for fear of their falling into the hands of the enemy. Last, but not least, we have the lUnJited States, which country was reported as being able to send us almost. fabulous quantities, owing to tho abundance of her harvest, and which maybe realiEed duringinext sammer, but certainly not sooner, as the latest advices report that the stocks on the seaboards, at the close of the canals, were moderate, and that the expo rts duiin- the winter monthswereexp ected to be on 'a limitedscale. Withregardtoourownkmgdom, the stocks held by fatmers and the trade are estimated at' seven to eight millions of quarters less than in 185S, and at about a nilion of quarters less than in 1 ' The stock of oldwheat remaining in these kingdoms at present is also unprecedentedly low, perhaps not more than 250,000 }unaters of milerse quality m the united kingdom. A knowledge of these facts had prompted our merchants some mouths ago to send'large orders to the Ufnited States, Spain, and other parts of the world, for grain to be executed, in mrny cases at the lowvest possible rates, or, in other words, without affixing a limnit, which, as a matter of course, would, had they remained in full force, have provided us WithL greatly ,increa,se4 supplies after, the opening of the navigation. ;But what is the state of matters at the present moment? The late intelligence of the probability of peace beig condluded etc long has phralyzed the grain markets; a fall of 5s. to 10s. per quarter on wheat has resulted, other descriptions of breadstuffs being influenced in an equal measure; and the great proportion of these orders to the United States and other q'artersfor grain has been consequentlydountermanded,although, if peace was to be ratiflied to-morrow, it could not possibly for three, four, or six pounths bring us ona bushel more grain from abroad than jweha previously exp&ted. The natitaIinference therefore is, with an acknowledged deficient harvest at home, ,that our supplies are more lkely to run short of our re,quirements nowthan they werebefore, andthat we may be overtaken with sciacity at a time when we least expect it. lSo doubt public opinion has an all-powerful influence on prices, and has frequently even driven them either down or up, as the' case iinght be, in defianceb of all mercantile calculation and experierce-as' we have frequently endeavoured to show; but it can orly hold its swa= for a time; the natural laws 'of."supply 'and deman " are xnre to resijume their power, sooner or later, -with redoubled 'force, and it is for this reason that 'we would caution our readers not to be too sanguie of any permanent reduction in theprice of grain ntil afteranother harvest is-secured. gl ost undoubtedly the reah. atiostof a good harrest, comfined with the gradual settling down of trade in all its branches, after the conclusion of peace, would, in the course of time, reduce the price of 'breadstuff5 to a more natural btandard than at present; but this is the work of time, and gannet be brought about mntil the stocks on hand are found to be in excess of the requirements, not only of these king-eor, but of the continent of E'urope; 'asid this we havo thownis not nowthe ase.

THIERS'S 'CONSULATE AND EWIBE.* - ter fifeen years of assiduous labour, TM Thiersis drawing towards the conclusion of the ample history which he commenced in 1840. His last! 'volumne includes the events of 1810 and of n1part of 1811. It reveals the treacherous basesof Napoleon's continiental system, the hollowness of his''iderstanding with the Northern Courts, his dissatisfac-L tion with the King of Holland and eventual' absorption of the Dutch provinces into his own', e,mpire. It shows equally the insatiable demands and insuperable difficulties of the war in Spain, the turning points of the struggle boetween Wellington and Massena, and the first prelu-des, as they may be termed, of that great catastrophe in w-hich the humiliation of the lieutenant prepared the Grun of: his master. The motive causes and mere incidents of the approaching downfall are traced by AM. Thiers with a firm pen, and from that large and comprehensive survey which is the highest attainment of the historian. As'we shaU have another opportunity of marking thel descending course of the French Emperor, we abstain here from considering the wider bearings of the, present narrative. We turn to the comparison sO naturally and fairly instituted between the req)ictive merits of'Wellington and Massena. "The two great warriors," says MI. Thiers, "who 'confronted each other at the extremities of Portuc9al could scarcely have taken any other~ course'than that which they did adopt at this moment. The one ounld not have defended more. ably: that extreme corner of -Portugal-the only portion which remained to him of the soil of the I'eninmila; the other could not have prepared more judiciously his plans of attack." On the posession of this famous promontory the whole fortunes of the greatest of European wars were dependent. If the English lost their hold of it Napoleon was unequivocally master of the world, and. could retain in peace the conquests he had alre'ady made: If the Eriglish stood their ground their persistence was the basis of a succession of advances upon the sldrts of his receding empire. The question wais one of imanense gravity, and xM; Thiers implies, even more than he expresses- his admiration of the foresight which selected and fortified this position with the famous " Lines" of wvhich he offers such a vigorous description. Butthe question, he maintains, "depended less on the two geneialswho wereicharged with itssolution byn ians of arms than on the two -Goverrmeits who were charged to furnish them with means ;" and helproceeds to distinguish between the resources of WVelhington, secured by anarrow chance, but still proved to be ample for his purpose, and the destitute state of Massena, imperfectly seconded, and expected with scanty'smeans to achieve extravagant exploits. " ''- The responsibility of Mlassena's failure is cast upon the Emperor, or rather on " that ordinary weakness of unlimited authority" which ends -by suppressimg even the thought of contradiction, and so deprives itself of the free counsel and support of its instruments. Napoleon -was too eager to accomplish new enterprises before his existing difficulties were'adtsted.t He did not realize, or, if he realiLed, he did not fairly admit the impediments to be encountered. He overbore the better judgoment of those who were better informed, because they were upon the spot, and he silenced, if he did not subdue, his lieutenant's repugnaiice to assume a compromising position by making promises which he could not keep, by delusive representations 'df his resources and intentions, and, lastly, by that caressing management of Massena's vanity which amounted almost to afascination d'lale femme. In the same mood in which he pulled the whiskers of one of his vieux moststAclies he fondled away the scruples of the ablest-of his generals, who henceforth -could refuse jiothing to the most gracious of masters. Massena says Ai. Thiers, "C submitted with that sadness of a discerning spirit which, from motives of gratitude or from motives of deference, may be induced to yield, but which yields without being the sport of its own illusions." |Massena was launched upon an enterprise in which he was fated to fail, and in which, to a great extent, he foresaw failure; but, consider the causes of his defeat as we may, the foundation of them all was the genius of Wellington. It was he who made more of military resources ongiially inferior to those of his antagonists. He had to combine discordant elements, to turn his back on captious doubts, and beneath the shadow of his country's despondency to woo victory itself,.by the most cautious approaches. He watched vigilantly and waited patiently for the happy occasion. He turned to his side the stubborn features of* nature and the still more adverse prejudices of the nation he was about to save. He planned and executed all with a sagacity and resolution which are beyond praise, and which are far beyond the doubts which TM. Thiers apparently implies as to thepropriety of his " ordonwu7ces crne0les," and the i2idispensableness of his strategy. What was a singrle Lusitanian harvest-what were the roofs of the Lisbon churches, if the French bombsheUs had reached them-to the results he contemplated ? We may go further, and ask, what was the peril of Portugal'a extinction to the still more precious gage of the lberties of the world ? It is superfluous to praise Wellinoton under any circumstances, even to sustain hit in the estiniation of M. Thiers, who in many respects pronounces as favourable a judgment as the most ap preciative of Wellington's own countrymen or posterity. We may question, however, whetlher in various points of detail he does adequate justice to Welington's manoeuvres. When the latter, for example, was faling back upon Torres Vedras, he apparently swerved from the tenour of his intent to fight the Battle of Busaco, and the only excuse IM Thiers can find for him is, that it was necessary to confirm the morale of his soldiers. Sir Wiliam Napier adds another reason still more important, inasmuch as it consisted with Wellington's-previous determination. So tardy were the Portuguese in obeying his injunctions to lay waste their country that it was only in consequence of the delay of the French army by this very battle that the orders were enabled to reach the persons to whom they were addressed. cM. Thiersfurther states that the English General was " gravely at fault" for permitting his position to be turned. He does not appear aware that Wellington calculated that Trant would have been at Boyalva on the road by which- this manceuvre was accomplished. Trant, however, had marched from Lamego by the circuitous route of Oporto, and had lost so many men from fatigue and desertion that, though he approached within four miles of his intended post, he could only bring 1,500 militia into line, and was not in sufficient force to check the French advance. It is, therefore, fairer to presume that Wellington was disappointed by circumstances which he could not by anymeans control than that he was, as AM. Thiers says, " gravely at fault" in one of the leading operations of the war. Again, it is a question whether M. Thiers does not take too favourable a view of Massena's chances at Fuentes YOnoro, though it muist be admitted that to a considerable extent he is countenanced by Napier. " As for the Battle of Fuentes d'Onoro i(he says), the principal action of this last period, we may say of it thisthat if assena perceived too late the weak side of his enemy's position; if he lost the day of the 3d of May in fruitless attacks on Fuentes d'Onoro, and that of the 4th in slothlul reconnaissances, he did at length discern the true point of attack, which so many generals detect neither at the commencement nor at the endof their battles; that on the 1th he acted with fadmirable Precision of view and vigourof character; and that if, on this third day, Reynier had been more enterprisin' before. Alam6da; if-Drouet had taken upon him to carry Fuentes d'Onoro, employing for that purpose the whole of his corps t'arsnvc - if Loison had marched quicker,- and more directly to the true end of' Is ,movements; if a miserable etiquette had not kept back. the Imeiial Guard, the English would have experienced a bloody disaster. It is ]?roper to addthat, in spite of all these.deficiincies -in spite of.alI.these-h*nings.back,. if Marshal. BIksieres hal not at the last moment created newobstacl% to success; if Masen'a h*d obtaiiied ior the njorrow (the 6th), at break of-diy, th6 iniunition he req,'redr he could yet, overpowering by, his ConstaniCy the constincy, of the English, have destroyed the fortune of.LordWellihg. ton, before which, at a later date, the fortuno of Napoleol was destined to succumb." -- The o mere-form of this passage suggests the consideration that an event whbich depended oxn SQ many hypottheticul positions; and wich' contained'so large' an eleinent of uncertainty, 'sbburld have been spo'ken4 of :wvith a hiss-'conifori-tabe' aiauxianc The maore raodeWt'conclusion-ofNapier, on reviewing-the saine circnpstances; is iore.to. our.o.w.n taste.

!ZO THE EDITOB OF THE TLJIES. Sir,-I should have wondered at Mr. Skinner's inconsistency in appealing to your columns on a subject which he pronounces unfit for "newspaper discussion," if I did not see in the rest of his letter strong marks of a similar confusion of ideas. Irreverent discussion would be unfit anywhere; but wben the Bishop of Exeter sends forth his opinions-nay, his criticisms-on a high court of justico and its learned judge, and when those opinions -and criticisms have beeri copied and commented on by sundry newspapers, I think I cannot be blamed for having, by your permission, recorded my reply in the greatest newspaper of all, where only I can be sure that every reader either of the original pamphlet or of any of its reproductions will see what I consider a fair and even necessary antidote. There is not one topic of Mr. Skinner's letter to which I could not make, as I thin], a satisfactory answer, even from other portions of the same letter; but I wi let that pass for the present, and only crave your indulgence to say a word on tle two main points of my reply-namely, the credence table and the usage of our church. Of the credence table I need say no more than that Mr. Skinner abandons its defence. The Bishop of Exeter gives up the name; Mr. Skinner gives up the thing. So far, re?eak quantuzm corusn jtsdictiun, Iam satisfied. As to the usage, I will bring the matter to a short issue with Mr. Skinner. Can he-who refers me to so many learned authorities-produce one single instance, from the date of the rubric in 1662 down to 1832, when the Tractsrian movement began, of the practical administration of the sacrament after the manner which he now advocates I D.

V7TF.P.TTAXM.TT.T.SV rTnr' T Mm 9% CLE'GAL V. JOS'TON. (Beorc ViccC-CaSncelZlOr Sir J. STVA31T.) I flhis case came before the Ctourt on further direction$. Ihe biD was filed in 18&1 by the Contess of Glengall for an injunction to restrain the defendant Robert Johnston from proceeding further in an action against the late Duke of Vealington, as constable of the liberty of the castle of Dover, for a false return to a writ of f. fa., issned against the Earl of Glengall, the plaintiff's husband. It appeared that the defendant Johnston, wlho was a creditor of the Earl of Glengall, instructed the constable of Dover to scize, under a writ of fi. far, the lugag e of lAdy Glengall on her expected landing at Dover from Erance, which vas done; lut, the luggage seized being caimed by Lady Glengall as her separate property, it was returned to her on her giVing to the constable, through her solicitor, anindemnnity against ny conseqaences; and the constable then made a return of nulla ton01. Upon this an action was brought by the defendant Jolmston against the late Duke of Wellingtoh for a fale return to the writ. By the order mnade on the motion for an iinjunction, dated in August, 1851, the constablewas ordered to give judgment in the action; but it was directed tbat execution should not issue without the leave of the Court, and an inquiry was directed as to vhether any, and what part, of the goods which had been seized at Dover was the separate property of the Countess of Glengall and, if any prt thereof was not her separate pro. perty, then whether sach part not beloncing to her was the property of the Earl her husband. In 153 the present suit was revived against the present Duke of Wellington, as the personal representative of the late Duke. The Master by bis report, dated in May last, found that the goods seized were the separate propertv of the plaintiff, and that no part thereof belonged to her husband. Mr. CA eS, for the plaintiff ask-ed that the injunction might be made parpetuali, and that all proper parties should concu;r in takiing the necessary steps to enter up satisfaction upon the judgment atlI.-. Mr. Dsyden appeared for the Duke of Wellington. The YIcE.Cu1SCu,LLOn made a decree as asked by xr. tCairns (Before VTce-Manedlor Sir W. P. WooD.) PAMR V. JEWELL. Tils was a billf ledby the well-known horse-trainer, Mr. Parr, to restrain an action on certain bils of exchange, dated respectively the 22d of August, 148, the 18th of December, lS45, and the 30th of November, 1849. The short statements in the bill were that the plaintiff prior to the year 1849 accepted the bills in question, with others, to accommodate a person named James Frederick Alen, with whom he had been acquainted some years; that at the time of such transaction the plaintiff was not indebted to Allen at all; that after Allen's death, on the 15th of March, 185, or 'while on his deathbed, Allen's son found among his fathers papers the bills in question (with others on which The plaintiff at la- had recovered pnor to the date of the suiti, and, without his father's santion, had handed them over to a person named Percival, who delivered them to -Tewell, tle present holder, without consideration. The defendantb his answver admitted that he had received the bills after they wsere over dute as a collateral security for a *lebt due to himn from Allen, but denied. positively al1 knowvledge of the transactions between Alen and Parr, and alIso the charges of fraud contained in the bill. When the cause came on for hearitg, in the course of last summer, there being an action thenpending to which there were pleas raising the issue of frnau and the other questions in the cause, his 11onour, after an argument which lasted some days, directed the hearing to stand over antil the trial of the action. The action was accordingly tried before Chief Justice Jervis. Mr. Serjeant Byles, Who appeared for gr. Jewell in that action, having abandoned the bill of the 18th of December, 1848, the Chief Justice directed the jury to find for the plaintiff at law (Jewell), on the ground that there was no evidence to support the pleas. 'lo that ruling a bill of exceptions was tendered by the defendant at law (Parr), and, under these circumstances, the case was again brought on before his Honour. Mrr. Ilolt, Mr. Elderton, and Mr. W. D. Lewis appeared forthe plaintiff; Mr. Daniel, Mhr. C. W.

CRHTRrsTTWA1 Mi7zgs in Ban&oZ, before Lord Cmqmim az,t} Jusim COTMlE,E Wtgan 1XPO- This was a eae stated for the opinion of the Court; ais. ing the question whether an order which had been made for the removal of three pauper children from the parish of St; NichoIas,Ipswich, to the parish of Coombe, the place of their ettlement, could be sustained. It was contended that the orderwas bd under the 3d section of the 9th atd 10th Victoria, c. 66 uponthe ground that the children were at the time resident with their mother and could not- be removed without her, the younger child also being under the age of nurture. It appeared that in the month of Oc. tober the three children m question were residing in St. Nicholas, Ipswich, with their mother, who wos uttrly unable from etreine poverty, to provide them with food oi clothing, or other necessary protection. The mother was nso living with ancther man, by whom she had had several Illgtimate children, andws thus induced to iiei1ect her legitimate children. An uncle of the children, fing them about the streets mn a state of want, relieved them severaf times, and eventuahlF ohtained from the relieving-of lcer an order for their admilssion to the workshou.se. Tbey were taken to the worikhouse on the Ist of November, ith Sheir mother's consent, and continued there until the 14th of February following, when an order WAs obained for their removal to Coombe, the place of their settlement. The_ question was whether, under the circumstances, thechildren were liable to be removed without their mother. ; - '; - Mr. mAnd 3fr. Belwer aared hr the ondents, and rr. Dasentaud I. efortheappe.

It appeared on the special case, that the society had been enrolled under the Friendly Societies Acts, and the clain of the plaintiff was resisted by the defendants on the ground that it fell within the provisions of section27of the 10thGeorgeIV., c.56, and their 32d rule; the former enacting that provision shall be made by a rule of each friendly society for the reference of all disputes betveen the society and its members, or between the members themselves, to arbitrators to be named, or be decided by certain justices ; and the latter providing, in compliance with the former, that "every matter in dispute between the institution and any of its members, or any person cLiming on account of any member, shall be referred to arbitrators." The question stated on the case, which embraced nil the rules of the institution, for the opinion of the Court was, whether the provisions relating, to arbita- ion in the policy (which included the 32d rule) and the Fwriehndly SocsetiesActswere of themselves a suflient defenceA tothe action.

The case was beard on Wednesday last, and fully reported, on the question of certificate, when his Honour reseved h-is iudg. mnent; His HoNoun said he had looked into the proceedings of 1838 and 1840, and he felt himself exonerated from the necessity of going into the general merits of the case, because he was most decidedly of opinion that the bankrupt, hivixng been adjourned stine die under the bankruptcy of 3.84/0 had no Iocds standi now to ask for his certificate, and he would adjourn the further consideration sinc dic, with hberty for hun to nply for a sitting if he should pass his examination under Lsprcviousbankruptcy. The bankrupt had not the candour to say that he had been adjourned ine die, but that adourninent was not only sine dic, but it was stronglymarkv with the disapprobation of Mr. Cormnis. sioneroroyd, who considerel accounts and explanations utterly unsatisfactory. Mr. LAWRANCE said he anticipated this decision, but under the circurmstances he had thought that the fact of his. being uncertificated since the last bankruptcy would have been no obstacle to his now receiving his certificate. He VWs not, however, aware that the bankrupt had not passed his last examination in 1840. The only question now was whether the Court would enlarge the bankrupt's protection; to enable him to pass his examination. His HO.YOUB.-EHe has not chosen to pass for 15 years Ibefore the Comnrissioner,to whom the caseregularlybelongs. L Mr. AwRAXCE urged that the bankrupt should be al-i lowed to purge thecontempt, and stated that he had been! in custody both before and after the bankruptcy. He had passed his last examination under his present bankruptcy, and the assignee had reported that the accounts were satihfsactory. His Hoors0U.-Yes; in the absence of all knowledge' ihat he did not pass under the previous bsakrnptcy. ;Mfr. L .WRACB.-The bankrupt states he will have no dmficulty i passing that examination.

His HoXiOUt.-Is he now in custody? MIr. LAWRAX-Ez.-No. If protection were now refused the bankrupt must either leave the country or go to prison. The Insolvent Court would not interfere, becanse the case was sub judice here. The bankrupt had now a bond fld* intention to satisfy his assignees. 'His HONOUR said the case was a bad onuP The bankrupt had passed as James Parker, John Parker, John Henry Parker, and James Phillips. Mr. LIRLATESR, for a creditor, thought the bankrupt was not entitled to any further protection, as he had not thought fit for 15 years to come before the Court, and his caTeer had u4ot becn such as to entitle him to the forbearance of the Court. The creditor sought his remedy against the person of the bankrupt. Ms IIoNsOM-I must refuse protection. The ba-ekrupt is utterly in his own wrong. (Before Afr. Commissioner GOruLBs.N.)

The bankrupts, Hugh Wiliams, sen., John WiDliamns, and Hugh Williams, jun., described as tsilors and commission agents, of West Simithfield, but better known as "Smithfield bankers," applied for their certificates.

His HoNouR said, the case had been before the Court tor some time, during a portion of which the bankrupts had been wvithout protecton. The creditors, however, must have thought favourbly, for none of them attempted to arrest them. The only comphaint against their conduct was that they did not keep their cashbook ,properly) a common fault wi1th men who fell into difficulties), bnt as there was nothing intentionally wrong in the case, and as their bankruptcy had partly arisen from unavoidable loss and misfortune, the bankrupts might take immediate second elass certificates.

Ata former dividend meeting claims for a large amount by parties who had suffered by a fire on the bankrupts promises were rejected by the Court, on the ground that the ashount of damage was not ascertainable at the time of the Mr.nItOPGOOD, the solicitor to the assignees, said, that the parties had appealed to the Lord Justices, and now intended to show, by the examination of witnesses, that the value of the timber w;as not only ascertainable, but actually ascertained at the time.

INSOLVENT DEBTORS COUBT, Jan. 23. BE FREDERICK JOI{NSTON. (Before the CHIEF Comnussiomm. This insolvent, forlerly a foreman to an upholsterer, applied for his disch Ldge. Mr. Dowvse opposed for Mrs. Ljydia Howa3rd, ana MIr. Reed suimorted. The opposing creditor is the executrix of her late husband, who was the keeper of the robing-room at Westminster-halL 'After her husband's death she applied to the in, solvent forpayment of a sum of 1B56L then owml. The in- Eolvnt pid vriosumns, amounting in all to 2 2l. lOs.,but then discontinued all attempts to reduce the debt. Tn Aprillast lrs. Howard commenced an action for the balane of the debt, to which the insolvent pleaded " never indebted," and further brought a cross action against Ms Howard for 1241., alleged to be due for money lent to her since her husband's death. Mmrs Howard's action was tried in May, when no defence was offered, and she recovered a verdict for the full amount claimed, her costs being taxed at 591. The insolvent proceeded in his cross action so far as togive notice of trial, but at the last moment his solicitor 'withdrew the record. 7Upon the 9th of June insolvent was arrested on a capies, and has remained in prisen since that tate.IThree I O U's, sig,ned by MWrs. Howard, were produced as being the documuents upon which the insolvent founded l his cross action; but the opposing creditor swrore (and the -' insolvent did not contradict) that two of the 10 U' lshad been given as receipts for the payment of money on account of the debt due to her, the insolvent having drawnunp thej papers in that fonn, and reqnested her to sign them, which I she did. TRhe third I OU sble admitted bore her signature, but she could not explain why it had been given, although shewas positive that no money had been lent upon it. Theislvent also professed himself unable to statefor what purpose this r 0 U had been given, observing tha' | it was signed when they were all drunk together. This assertion, however, was positively denied by Mrs. Howard,. The insolvent, upon being examined as to the disposal of I property which he recently psessed, admitted that between the 8th of December, 1 and the 9th of May, 1855, he received from the sale of property cash to the amount of 780?., the sum redeived on the last-mentioned date being no less than 300!. He swore that at the period of his arrest, on the 7th of June, all that money was gone, - having been expended in travellmg and hotel expenses. Upon being arrested he offered the opposing creditor 5s. in The pound upon the amount of the debt and costs,-but that ' offer being refused he filed his petition in July. jThe Cruir Coaemnsoyz, mn giving judgment, said that . of the many cases which had come before him this was one I of themost disgracefu, perhaps in a small compass the wolst case. In the first instance, there had been agross and wicked fraud to resist the creditor's claim ; havig in duced her to give I U U's for receipts, he avaied himself of those false documents to bring an action against her, and it the same time put ina3 false plea to the suit she had begun against bins. Those facts told badly against the insolventhut, beyond that, he (the Chief-Cormmissioner) blievid Ithere were still ample means-of discharging the debts. La sIx months the insolvent had received upwardstof 700Lv . which he declared he had spent in travelling and in hotel expenses. He (the Commissioner) did not believe that statement; but, on the contraxy, was of opinion that the insolvent had the means of paying his debts if he chose to do so, and if the judgment about to be pronounced should: appear severe that circumstance must be considered. The insolvent would be discharged upon the expiration ofthree year from the date of his vesting order (July 5,1855). (Befot-e Mr. Commissioner MuRpry.) InRx E BEzER DAVIES. This insolvent, a Dissentingminister, applied for his finil order. He was plaintiff in an action against Mr. Pratt, the publisher of the BritisM Banner, for a libel, which was reFeu=dtorarbitration and decided adversly to him. Mr. DOWSN to-day appeared for the Rev. hlr, Tidmn, the foreign secretary of the MIissionary Society, and for Messrs. Reed and Pardon,.printers to the society, against whom the insolvent had brought actions for libel, which were also referred, and were, by consent, to ahide the de,ci!sion in the case of "Davies v. Pratt." In these cases the defendantswere awarded their costs, but, not being yettaxed, the learned counsel contended that they did not constitute a debt in law, and therefore ought not to be inserted in Iis schedule. 3Mr. REED, for the insolvent, contended the costs were claims which he wasbound to insert in his schedule. 3Mr. Commissioner M-sarar said it was a nice point, but he was inclined to think the items under discussion should remainin the schedule. M:r. SARGooD then, on behalf of Mr. Pratt, whose costs had-been taxed at 1,08W., entered upon an examination of the insolvent respecting the disposition of his propertj which had all disappeared at the period of filing the petition, - Thelearned C03nxsso.yxa said he should only try the. question as to the disposal of the property since the awatd was gven2 With respect to that disposed of by the insol'vent beforethat-time for the purpose of taking proccedings toclearhis character, itWould eb a startling noveltyto hol'dthatamanhadnorighttodqso. 1 The insolvent was then examined respecting the sale of, his furniture to his father-in-law, and some property to :etherpersons, about the time the award wasmade. .Iltimately an adjourmmentwasasked for by the opposing ereditors, in order that the balance sheet might be amended, and, the insolvent's counsel consenting, the case was ad jotrneduitil the 6th of February.

I was forced about in the crowd in and out, and, being injured in the spine and ruptured, I was hurt, and withdrew until the pressure was over. I never attempted to pick any one's pocket, and never thought of such athing.". The witnesses were crossexamined by Mr. SLxIcTG, whr in his address to the jury, complained that a policeman, whose duty it was to prevent crime, should, as the Policeman in this case said - he: did, watch a person makina attempts to pick pockets and refrain fram interfering until an offence haM been actually c6mmitted. He urged the jury to receive thepoliceman's evidence wit h caution, and said that it was consistent with probability that the prisoner did, as he 'would O&A.Ah- fr T, pick the purse np.

Until lately he had been working aL I. docks as a carpenter. He never heard anything against his honesty. Cross-exmnineA-The prisoner gave evideneo against the Charists. Did not kInow that he got his living by giving evidence at the poEce-courts. Mr. SLs.Gn objected to these questions. The AssIsrT,-.JunDGEz thought they were not reldvant' to the question as to whether the prisoner stole this purse. The witness aid the prisoner was at Adelaid' two or three years.. Mr. James Nichols, receiver of rents, Warwick-court, said he knew the prisoner. Never heard anythimg against his character for honesty, but always thought hin a great fool for being mixed up in poltial matters as he had been, and he thought this clarge -was a trap laid for him. Mr. DALn.-YoU have no right to say that. Don't answer this question until I have his Lordship's opinion upon it. Did not the prisoner turn Queen's evidence against those he acted with in the Chartist affair, and reeeive a large sum of money from Government? Mr. SLEImH objected. What on earth had that to do with this case ? The Ass sTA?T.JuDGE said hb thought the questiou had no bearing on the case. That was the whole of the case. The AssTAsNT-JUDGE summed up the evidence, and said it was for the jury to say whether they were satisfied beyond doubt-substantial, bonzl $dc doubt-that the prisoner did steal this purse. If they had any doubt on the matter, as to whether he might have piclced it up, then, of course, they would give him the benefit of it, and acquit him. The jury returned a verdict of Not Guilty. Prisoncr.-My Lord, I beg to thank the jury for the lenient view they liave taken. Am I not to leave the bar without a stain on my charaeter, for I am innocent of this charge? ; The AssIsrMM-TUDGE.-Aything you say cannot, as I see, mend your position.

There were three indictments against them, but only one was tried. Brown was found guilty and Crowley acquitted. The AssiTm-yr-JuDGP sentenced Brown to six years? penal servitude.

Thie first charge against the prisoner, who is a German, was that of stealing a watch,' value 6?., the Property of a countryman of his, named Andrew Lundell, from Ils lodgings, the defence being that he was acquainted with the prosecutor, and took the watch and pawned it to raise money to meet a sudden emergency. He thought he was authorized, if not directly, at-least in an imphed ianner, to do so. The second, was, that one night he ieta girl named Ann Walters, in eent-street, accompanied her to her lodgings m Cirencester-places and went to bed with her.

He watched him hiemelf for some time,.but was wanted elsewhere, and then told a police sergeant to watch him. In about half an hour after that he was againi induced to watch him,' and then distinctly saw him with his right hoa in the pocket of a lady's dress. He inmmediately went up to and. seized hin, lling him that such patics -would not bepermitted there, ad at the'same time asked the lady if she 'had, lost anything. The prisoner anticiVated her aust wer by ihis-il replying "l No, no, she has not, 'and that ultimateY tufil out to be the case, but the position of the prisones hand, was so dstinctly visible that there couldbe no doubt of his motiv, and he therefore gave him into custody.

At first tFe proceedings d4l xotattLact many auditors, but as the day advanced thle )ell becr.ne crowded. I tr. H. A Deane was angain in attendance, conducting the \5rqniey in the interest of the Crown, and Wiliam Palmer, thevrisoner, was, as previously, represented by Mr Smith, cf Birmingham, his solicitor. - Dr. Taylor, Professor of -Chymistryin Guy's Hospital, Dr. EeqProfessorof-Materia teicEa in the same institution,. and Capt.in Hatton, chief -of the county conistabulary, were aLso present.. 3r. Val lancey Lewis, solicitor, of Bedford-row, appeared on beliaf ',f the witncss. Mr. Thomas Pratt. .t the close of the lasb sitting of the Court, and while our xqIort was being despatched, Mrs. Palmer, a lady-like per--:n, thewidowof Mr. WalteiPamer,the deceased, was r.aldr.n her deposition in a private room in the presence of the coroner only, by an arrangement iuade to save her the Tan of a public examination. We precede our account of the proceedings of to-day with her deposition, not then attainable, which preserves the continuity ot our report of the eNidence. She said,-I am the widow of the late Walter Palmer, and reside at No. X0, Chatham-strect, 3iverpool. On Saturday, the 4th of August last, my hus1.aud came to Liverpool between 11 and 12 o'clock, and st-,yed with me until 10 in the evening of the Sth of August -when he returned to Stafford by the mail train. Daring that time he was5 constantly with me and was pretty wellii:.uach better than I had seen him before. e was quite himIelf. He did not take any intoxicating liquors while with me, but a glass or two of bitter beer at dinner. There was -wine on the table, but he did not taste it. He got much letter while he stopped, and left me greatly improved in health. His cough was much better. We had been talking seriously of his taking the pledge, and he had almosb proanised to do so. When he left he was shortly to return to Liverpool. He had always been in the habit of writing to nie about twice a-week, sometimes oftener. Tshere were pefle(lwhen he did not write so often. On he 10th of Augusit, after his return to Stafford, I received the following letter from him, which Iproduce. The post mnark bore the date August 10, 185. (He died on the 17th fCstle-terrace. "My dearest Agnes,-I left you last evening, and did feel I possessed a light heart; but on my arrival at War,irigto4 I found the north express was three-quarters of an hour late, oving to the 'food washing away arches, -6c. I was lonely-only myself in the carriage. The rain on my arrival was incessant. Thanks to God, I had not very far to go. I have been home to-day, and am tnly sorry to say mother has been very unwell, but i s better. I told Sarah you was going to the concert on the 27th, and she wished to go. Please write to her, and she can join me; you can put me anywhere. If I should bring little Ms Barber, you von't be jealous, dear, will you 9 but I do not know whether we shall meet or not. I should likke y ou to lciow one steady, sensible creatuire upon earth, but not a teetotaller in principle. She says I never drink one glass of wVine in 12 months, and therefore have no ocecaion to be a T.T.R. I wvill write you to-morrow and explain a little few secrets. Good night, God bless you, and ever believe in the affection of " WALTER Pm.IETR." I answered that letter immediately, but I never heard from him again. On the 17th of AugustMr.WiliainPalnier came to me at Liverpool, and inforned me of my husband's dleath on the preceding day. I asked him why he had not Iwritten to me or telegraphed for nmc, and he said that Walter had said he couild write himself if he wanted me. I wished to go to Stafford immediately to see my husband before he was buried, but William Palmer said he had been obliged to close him up in lead, and it was no use say going, for I could not see hins. He said that he had been sent fox to see Ihim on Thursday morning, and that Mr. Day had been in attendance upon him all the week. He said lie had been delirious for days, and had broken a blood vessel two hours before his death, and had had a fit of apoplexy. Inl consequence of 3r. William Palmer's statement I abandoned the idea of going to Stafford. (Witne!s thea prod ced the letter she received from William Palr^ =datedthe 27th of September last._-,elmeef-Ryhnsbands date the following day, b°Tbelieved his life was insured journal on WednesdLy'if repeatedIy told me so. I often dleath fsb.d'C,sflie wouIdtake the pledge and keep it forssi .Sonths, I wvould return to him and live w ith him. I first separated from hinx about seven years ago, and since that period I have been wNith Ixim three or four months at Stokeupoin-Trent. I left him on that occasion in consequence of his intemperate habits. I think 3Ir. Campbell, surgeon at Stoke, once attended my husband while at Stoke. I was once two years and did not see my husband at all, when he was in the Isle of Man. I saw hin on the 21st of July, 1855, in Liverpool; lie stayed till the 23d ; previous to that he came to Liverpool in the beginning of May, 1855, and stayed a day or two. He also came on the 3d, 4th, 10th, and Ilth of Anril. I.*hW1t, n-1t Mr. Deane opened the proceedings this morning-by statinl that Drs. Taylor and Rees were in attendance from instruc thins they had received from the Home-office in deferenc( to the wish expressed by the jury .at the last sitting, and hi suggested that the coroner should nowv read over, in theib presence, the evidence given at the previou3s sitting touchin~ the h.abits of the deceased and his symptoms shortly befort .and at the timse of his death. The Coroner then read over the evidence of Mr. Day surgeon at Stafford; MIrs Walkeden and Thomas Walkeden her husband; Mrs. Phillips, Mrs. Parkes, Mrs. Astle, Tho nas Myatt, the " boots" at the Junction Inn, Stafford Mr. Lloyd, the landlord; and the extracts from Palmer'; diary, reyorted in this journal on Tuesday and Wednesda3 last. Before doing so, he adverted to certain remarks whicl had appeared in portions of the weekly metropolitan presv re'decting on the tovwn of Rugeley, its inhabitants, the juryv and himsqelf, w*hich, ho said, on his own part and that of tin lury, were anfounded. He added, with regard to hirnself that on a future occasion, after this imeiry w tas concluded, he should be auite ready to give an ample explanation of bli conduct in tins miatter which had been mn3ae the subject oi animnadversion. Mr. Smith objected to the reading of the evidence oi G;eorge Whymanl, w;ho spoke to the purzchase of a bottle oi hi-drocyanic acid by WVillam Palmer at his mnaster's shop ir Wfolverhampton on. a. Tuesday in Augus last, until he had s further opportunity of testing his credibility, for he had reason to believe that the statement of WVhyman wzas as entire fabrication. Dr. Taylor said, the testimony of, Whyman was not necessary to enable Dr. Rees and himself to form an opinior as to the cause of the death of the deceased; and it wnas nol read. Mr. Benjamin Thirlby, the former partner of Willian Palmer, was called, and, in reply to Mr. Deane, said,-] am a chynnist and druggist, and knew Wiliam Palmer and Walter Palmer. I remember the day on which WlV.tes died. It -was a Thursday, a Ludlow race day of last year, but I cannot remember the day- of the month. William 3Palmer had a horse running that day at Ludlow. When 'William left Rugeley that Thursday morning he told me he was going to the races at Ludlow. .Mr. Samuel Henry Campbell examined by 3Mr. Deane, -aid,-Iain a physician and surgeon at Stoke-upon-Trent. I knew the deceased. I was his medical attendant from June, 18&.3, until June, 1ISM. In 1852, when I first attended hiim, he had an attack of pleura pneumonia, and was also suffering from chronic inflammation of his liver. The liver was enlarged too, and during his illness he had an attack of congestion of the brain. That attack continued about six or eight weeks. I attended him3 agai, I think, from January till March, 18S. He was then suffering from enhareement of the liver and extreme irritability of the stomachi. lIe also vomited large iiuantities of venous blood at that time and the right lobe of his liver was in a line with his navel it was so enormously large at that period. He had dropsy too, in his lower ambs, and inflammation of his niht kidney. I did not see hiam after that. His ilness at that time continued aboat two months. By the Coroner.-During the time of his illness I never saw his brother Wiliam at all, nor before. Walter spoke to me of insuring his life during the last illness for which I attended him. Heasked me what sort.of a subject he would be for insurance. I anawed, that no medical man should pass him, he w-as so oranicaliy diseased. I told him also that his life w-s a hWhly hazardous one. His habits were exceedingly intemperate. BIMr. Deane.-At no time had I any conversation with Wi 'am Palmer as to the state of his brother's health. I think- it far more ik-elythat he died from apoplexy than from prussic acid. I ha-ve beard-the evidence read to-day, ynd I think-the is nothiRgaiconsistent in the death from prussic acid from the descriptions given of the symptoms in -that evi,enom The-organic disease of which I nave spoken 'wrould be very mich increased by drink. By the Coroner.-There is nothing inconsistent in the descriptin of the symptoms with death by a narcotic poison. 22cothlon nud opium would .pradcuce the same symptoms as -tose which the deceased exhibited. By Mr. Smite.-There was dpease of the iddneys in his ci.se, whichwould impede the circulation through itself (the kidney) of course. I the circulation of the system is - inm- .'eded by any Iorgan, Ats lance wouldm be imperfect and -the system become greatly deranged.

I have knowvn one death iQthin an hour. In amne cases effusion of blood would,leave traces at aeosi shrktenz examination. In the sudden eases of apoplexy there is generally disease of the heart, associating with disease of the brain. The symptoms of Walter Pabler -were coma, by which we understand the loss of all cerebral motion, a certadn lividity of tho face (as described by some of the witnesses),-.dilatation of the pttpils, 'the eyes partly open and f .ed forannoied tnobv Iss. P illinsL. reneral relaxation of the limbs and of the niuscles of the body, stertorous breatismg, coldness of the surface of the skin with clammy p iration, and a ti-itching of the muscles on the left siXeorthe face. These are aU the symptoms that I have been able to mark down as mnedical evidence in thus case, and they are, in miy opinion, quite consistent with death from poison by prussic acid, taken in the space of half an hour before death. By a Juryman.-Frussic acid would not produce a pain in the back. A state of coma dispels all sensation of pam. Death from Prsasic add is a very rapid kind of apople. Five-and-twcnt) drops of prussi -aci, of Scheele's strengt, have, before tins, destroyed a person in 20 minutes. By Tr. Deane.-I don't think the smeU of a fatal dose of prussid acid given in two tablespoonsful of brandy would bc detected. Brandy does avay with the smell of the prussic acid to a certain extent. I produce now 25 drops of pru.ic acid, mixed with one tablespoonful of brandy, indI can detect the smell of the acid. Two tablespoonsfuls of brandy would nmore effectually drown the smell of the pussic acid than one. The pow-er of detecting the smell of the acid wvould depend upon the quantity of brandy and the proportion of prussic acid, and whether the attention of a person was directed to die smell. I have frconeatly net been able to detect the acid by the smell in medical mixtures when I have been able to detect it by analysis. I have never heard of stertorous breathing preceding an attack of coma in cases of apoplexy. In nay experience it usuaUy follows conma, and does not precede it. The true stertorous breathing is a state of coma. Stertorons breathing is not inconsistent withpoisoning by prussic add, but death in such a case usually takes place so rapidly that the stertorous breathing has scarcely ever or rarely been observed. Stertorous breathing is the result of pressre on the brain ; and whatever may produce coma mayor may not produce stertorous breathing. In ny opinion, touching the eause of death in the case of Walter Palmer, fromn the additional evidence which has been given, th case resolves itself medically into one of death from apoplexy, arisingfrom excessive drinking, or itito one of death from apoplexy, arising from the effects of prussic acid. In favourof the hypothesis of de.ath by apoplexy from excessive drinking I have taken notes of the fellowig points :-thie evidence of Thomas Walkeden and Dr. Campbellt-on the very large quantities of alcohol or alcoholc lquids taken by the deceased, the absence of any evidence that he teok prussic acid, as far as I am aware, and which in order to iave kiUed him he must have taken nithin half an hour of. Iiis. death; and a third point I have also marked down, as one on which we rather rely in medical testimnony, the absence of any poison in the body when submitted to examination. On that point I vish to make one observation. I once had an opportunity of testing the contents of the stonsach of a man who died from the effects of a dose of three draclums of prussic acid, or seven times the quantity that has destroyed life. I found that after 12 days I could not, by the most careful distillation, detect the slightest trace of prusaic acid. This is owing to twro circumstances-fixat, to thle great v oLatility and diffusion of prosaic add; and, secondly, w.hen the aninmal niatter pultrefles in contact with it, so as te produce hydrosulphate of ammonia, the poison ih chynicaUly destroyed. I should not expect to find any trace of prosaic acid in a body in a closed coffn afte; three or four monthli' interment. If this were a question of poisoning by antimony, by arsenic, or by niercnry, the non-discovery of the poison would be adverse to the belief that the person died of poison; but in the case of prussic acid, after Or- '` period, we can never expect to find i;-. -not in any non-discovery of it in MA)t- fl ~z prosaic acid. The way isconsistpe.s - - 1g are consistent either with death esult of excessive drinkiing, or with ISUl2Z@from apoplexy, as a result of prussic acid; and there is this great peculiarity in the case. -' ~-a~ Jr--~t --J -o m-av meen taKn, zins ordinary symptoms may have been somewhat modified by the drinllkig habits of the deceased. The stertorous breathing, for instance, whicli is always or generally attendant upon poisoning by alcohol, may have been in this case artl dependent on the quantity of alcoholic liquid taken ty the deceased. Resting upon medical data, it is impossible to say, from the account given, whether the deceased died from prussic acid or from apoplexy, as a resnlt of excessive drinking. I am givig my opron now on medical grounds alone. The only a solate solution of this question would have been by an examination in this case of the stomach and head of the deceased within two or three days after deathL A very rapid death like this, within half an hour, is, according to my experience, very rare, unless, conibined withtheapoplexy, there be also disease of the heart. In poisoning by prussic acid, the ahmost universal rule is that death takes place within half an hour, or the person recovers. That is generaUy the rcsult. It is probable, in the very rapid death that must have taken place here, there would be cffuion of blood on the brain ; but I think the brain, as described by Dr. i'lbnckton, was not in a state, from its being so softened by decomposition, to enable us to say -whether there was or was not any effusion of the blood on it at the time of death. InaU cases of apoplexy effusion of blood on the brain would give a lurid or bluish cast to the features. By Mr. Snith-Dr. Rees andI examined the heart of the deceased palticularly, in order to discover the cause of sudden death. Dr. Monckton said itvwasshriveUed, collaFsed, pale, and empty, as in all such cases. Dr. Rees and I lave made very minute examination of it, and I think we can positively state there was no disease in the heart which eould accoumt for sudden death. 'e could discover no disease in the heart, and in my belief there was none at the time of death. There was at least not that disease of the heart wlhich would be attended by sudden death by apoplexy. There was, in fact, no disease of the heart at the time of death. Apart from the circumstances attending this particular case, I tlink it was one fit for inquiry. Wherever a person dies in an interval so short as half-an-hour I think it is a case for investigation, The fact of throwing off the blood from the stomach 'was an indication of a congested state of the system, and in all probability, as Dr. CampbeU had suggested, might have een dependent on a diseased state of the liver. A diseased state of the liver might tend to produce congestion of tne brain. It acts by preventing a free circulation of the blood through the organ, and would derange the systeon Apoplexy wrould not, I think, be caused by disease of the liverand kidneys, because there is no special connexion between the liver, the kidneys, and the brain. After very long habits of drinkig the vesses of the body, especiaUy those of the brain, become weak. If the kidney was congested the effect would be to relieve the system in other parts, and would rather tend to relieve than oppress the braim. In my opinion, if the deceased died from apoplexy caused by narcotic poison, he did not die from morphia, but my opuon is, that if he died from prussic acd it must have been given him within half an hour of his death. By a Juror,-Assuming a diseased condition of the vessels and effusion of blood on the brain, I should have exuocted the deceased would have died from apoplexy in an irterval not shorter than two or three hours. By the Coroner.-The size of the heart was perfectly natural. It must be admitted, taking into consideration the deceased's habits of drinking for so long a time, that there may have been a diseased condition of the vessels of the brain. Dr. Taylor, on leaving the witness-box, stated, incidentaly, that Scheele himself died by aecident from the vapour of a quantity of his own prossic acid which he was in the act of&prparing. Dr. &oe OewenRees,LectureronMateriaMledicaatGus's Hospital, andAssistant Physician there, said,-Iassisted Dr. TaCor in maakin the analysis in this case. My opinion, afterhearing an te evidence, is, that the cause of death may either have been apoplexy from natural disease or prssic acid_ We were unable to detect prussic acid in the, cody, but even had it been present at the time of death three months' internent would have been sufflcient to produce its vaporization or decomposition. I don't Imow that I have anything more to add to that. By Mfr. Deane.-Wfe could detect no disease in the heart at all. We examined its valves very carefully, andthe thickness of the ventricles; butwe could detect nothing abnormal inany-part of it. The kidney.appearedto besomewhat congested when compared. with other organs. We had only one kidney sent to us, and I can only speak to that. The organ exhibited no sign of organic disease, unless congrestion mlay be interpreted as such. The liver had evidently bceen diseased during lfe. It was enlarged, and its edges thick-i coed. In respect to the other organs sent to us I have no particular remark to make. Thedurationof an attack of apoplexy arising from natural disease or from hard drinking would be about from four hours and a-half to a day and a- half, or even longer. lam speakind of a case of apoplexy occurring in a drunkard. Four hours and a-half woula be a very rapid case. This case of Walter Palmer was a veryrapid instance of apoplexy, occurring, as it did, in half an hour or 20 minutes. Swh cases are recorded, but they are rare. The death of Walter Palmer could be accounted for on both theories-either from apoplexy or from prussic acid. There are even cases where anlost immediate death has been produced by apoplexy, and not' apoplexy eccasioned by poison; but theY are extremelv tare *nch eas have nem-'rrPd in rlne oettcr class of society with persons who were not great drunkards, bst yet at times drank very freely. Such persons have died of apoplexy within a fewv minutes -as few as 10 suinates* but I never attended such a case. I refer to one cse on recosrl particularly where all the ordinary symnptos of apoplexy were present, and where the patient was from 6( to C5 years of age. The duation of an attck of apoplexy zsultingin death is msually governed by the iortion of the brain which is invaded by the effusion of bloor In aU cases if the effa'son takes place at the base of the brain death will be rXcnid. Most probably in Walter E'almer's case the effusioni of blood took pace on tlie ventricles of the brain, or in tha 4iei,hbourhood of the ventricles, but not- in the base of t4el brs-uL I am spealdng now, of the ordinary position of an apoj4ctio clot in a case of -a pIo . There would be no apo.eect clot in the case of apoplexy by serous effusion on the brax m In the case of an effusion lon tho ventricles of the brafn ±he attack would be more protracted than in the instanee d investigation. By 3Mr. Smitl7-The symptoms described by Dr. M3onokton as visible on thtS post mortem examination of the briain are not inconsistent ith the existence of a clot at the bo e of the brain.

The medical man present at the death, and wlho attended him before death, irould have soene advantage over auother medibal man not present in assigning the cause of death. Li these cases we Judge of the cause of death -by a certain set of symptoms presented to us, and, though those symptoms may be modified in different individuals, they are not entirely changed.. Mr. Day, surgeon at Stafford, was recalled, and, in reply to a question put by Mr. Bergen, the pohee superintendent at Lichfield, said,-I never stated to Ir. Shaw, the saddlerat Stafford, that I believed Walter Palnier was poisoned. I may have said, andI believe Ihave said, in conversation with Mr. Shaw, Mlr. Deane, Mr. Ratton, and MIr. Smith (the attorney for William Palmer), that I thought if he (William Palmer) had poisoned his vfeand Ccook, it was not at all impossible thathe might also have poisoned his brother too. My original opinion that Walter Palmer died from apoplexy is now only the more confirmed by the evidence I have heard from Dr. Campbell to-day. Mr. Smith appealed to the coroner to strike off his notes the evidence just elicited from the, witness, at the instance of a mere superintendent of police, in reference to a conversation at which the prisoner William Palmer was not present, and who had no right to intrude himself upon the notice of the Court. George Whyman was recaUld, and said, in reply to Mr. Deane,-I have brought a book with me to-day, and am now able to fix the particular day on which William Pahnfer purchased a bottle of prussie acid of me in the shop of my employers, Messrs. 31ander, Weaver, and Co., wholesale chynusts, at Wolverhampton, as deposed to by me at the last sitting of the jury. It was ti 14th of August last. A customer amned Hill, of Kidderminster, was im the she pat the tune the purchase was made. . By Mr. Smith.-I know it was Wiliam Palmer by seeing him for about 10 minutes in London in 1852. I did not see him from 1852 till Auaust last, nor did I speak to him when I saw him in 1852. 1 had him pointed out to me in London as Mr. William Palmer, of Rugeley, by Mr. Gadsby, of the Punch Tavern, in Fleet-street, in the smoking-room tlere. A Mr. Nettlc, who stayed tlere, was also n the room at the time I had Palmer pointed out to me. I was then living in Ludgate-hill with Messrs. Orridge. Wiliam Palmer, I was told, was in the habit of staying at the Punch Tavern. Six months after I first had him pointed out to me I saw him speaking to Mr. Nettle in Flect-street * whom I asked aftevrards if that was Mr. Palmer, and Le said it was. Mr. Hill, of Kidderminstor, does not know Mr. Palmer to my Lknowledge. It was about 12, or a quarterpas 12 o'clock, when Palmer bought the prussic acid of me mn the shop. [Mr. Smith stated that on that day MIr. W. Palmer left Stafford by the 12 o'clock trin for Wolverhampton.] It would take him three-quarters of an hour to come from Stafford to our shop at. Wolverhampton. I left the shop that day at 1 o'clock, and it musthave been half an hour or 20 minutes before that that Palmer canie into the shop and purchased the pr£saic acid of me. Mlr. Smih said, the witness's story was a wicked and base fabrication, as lie would afterwards abundantly prove by the evidence of 3fr. Dykc and M5r. Painter, of Stafford. To 51r. Deane.-3Ir. Gadsby married a sister of mine. Hec told me on the occasion to w hici I have referred that William Palmer owed him some money. I have no doubt that it was on the 14th of August last that I sold Will:-- Palnmer the prussic acid. - aum a confee- Samudel lill examined by the cnrrtno 14th of August tioner at lddedrl v lander and Weaver's, in Wolver. lastfl, ieh,a veen 12 and 1 o'clock, as near as I can -mess. a, .ntleman, whom I did not knowv, came in while1 was there, and asked for some things.

We are also in a position to state that it is in contemplation to institute an inquiry into the conduct of the coroner. VERDICT. (BY ELECTRIC TEtEGRAMys.) The jury retired shortly after 6 o'clock, mad, having been absent tvo hours, returned the folowing verdict:- "We find that Walter Palmer died from the effects of prassic acid; and that such prussic acid was wilfully administered by Willian Palmer."
THE 3MURDER W LIVERPOOL.-The inquest on the body of the unfortunate girl, Sarah Drunmond, closed about G o'clock on Tuesday evening, wlhen the jury retured a verdict of " Wilful Murder against John Ferguson," who was committed under the coroner's warrant to take his trial at the next assizes. During the inquiry the prisoner, who is a uiiiserable-looking, undersized man, with a remarkably smiall head, displayed considerable emotion.

ExrxAostDiARz AcciDEaNT.-A very extraordinary accident, serious in its nature, and which might have been veryfatal in its consequences, occurred at Bath early on Tuesday morning. Ai large vat of beer, containing nearly 400 barrels, belonging to lMr. G. Bracher, of the Portlandbrewery, explodea vith such force and noise as to shake many of the neighbouring houses, and induce a belief among the inhabitants that an earthquake had tak-en place. Beneath the brewery, which is situated at r,ght angles with C-rooked-row-a very' steep acclivity-is a couLrt of houses running parallel with it ; and the floor of the honse in which the vat was is consequently considerably above the floors of the houses in this court. Most of these houses were more or less injured by the shock, and the beer forced its way through the walls of three or four of them, the inmates being startled from their beds by the noise of the explosion-which is described as being like that of a piece of ordnance-andthe'rushing of thebeer. One of these houses, which was situated immediately contiguous to that part of the brewery where the vat was, ~was occupied by a mian and his wife and 10 children, the whole of whom had to escpe into the street in their night-clothes. Three of the children, indeed, wvho were slee ing in a turn-up bedstead in te kitchen, were rescued with some difficulty, having been completely immersed in the beer, which rushed through the wals, foring out large stones, and inundating th omt the depth of some feet. The walls of this hue were so cracked that a man's hand might be placed in the apertures, and,, had it been less substantialfy built, it is fearful to contemplate what the consequences might have. been to the large familybywllhom it was inhabited. When. our informant examined it on Tuesday the house presentedl. a most remarkable appearance. Everything was satur-ted -with beer, the drawers of the tables, the bo-iler, &c., werefilled with the same liquor, -which hadl overflowed- all the furniture, anxd plister dad lag stones lay abouit -the; floors, which were covered withathick banny froth. The' beer rushed from the bre very and houses beneath into the stzeet, which was completely flooded with the hquor, and, the scene presented as such as is seldomwitnesse The beer was of the best description, and had been brewed about 12 months Thbeovatowa comthe bo wn toe pdmiec madeebyrthendeitwofte empoyed ind this dockasrd binreer- and had there represented the grievance in question, whenithey were requested to reduce the matter to writing for transmission to the Admiralty.

That whenever compilints have been made by seamen of the unseaworthiness of the vessel to which they belong it is the practice of the justices (none of whom are shipowners, although practically well conversant with maritime business), before finally coming to a decision on such an important point, to request the surveyor to Lloyd's or other equally competent person to report upon the state of the vesseL The result of a long experience has showvn the Bench that in tho great majority of cases the proof of tho allegation of unseaworthiness entirdy fails. It is aplea frequently set up by men who have determined at any cost to quit their ships, and after all needful repairs have been effected, under the direction of the surveyor, it is often found that, in opposition to evidence of the most conclusive and iuquestionibalo character, seamen submit to imprisonmnent for the sole purpose of freeing theiselves from their agreements. Indeed, I may add that, with few exceptions, magisterial interference is not required by the large class of well-disposed seamen; a s a rul1e, those who undergo punishmeat have the ulterior object of releasing themselves from their articles. In conclusion, I have to express the regret of tlle Bench that a gentleman occupying so important a position as that of Inspector of Prisons should nbt, either by direct conference with the autlherities, or by the adoption of some other equally satisfactory course, have ascertained beyond doubt the accuracy of statements intended for publication. The report, as it stands, is necessarily ex prie, and inflicts injustice on members of an unpaid body whose sole desire is to act waith impartiality and fairness. Althoughthe magistrates have not the honour of Mr. Perry's personal aeqnaintanct, I venture to assure him of their readiness to afford every facility in their power to pro*mote the discipline of the prison and thiejusdicious treatment of its inmates.

My Lord,-I have to acknowledge the receipt of your conununication of the 8th inst., addressed to -the visiting justices, and calling their attention to the alleged defective condition of the Falmouth Borough Gaol, anl, with refer, ence to the extract from 3Mr. Perry's report, which accompanied your letter, the visiting justices have to state,- 1. That the recommendations made in the 14th and l6th ainual reports were acted upon, so far as the circumstances of the borough pe'nitted; the special letter, however, dated the 14th of September, 1847, the justices have no knowledge of fuirther than that afforded by your conmuniu cation; they are not, therefore, in a position to make any conmnent with respect to it. It appears flonm the minutes of the proceedings of the Borough Council, in 1847, that, in consequence of the then crowded state of the gaol, the council apipjg wrties Lords of Her Majesty's Treasa 6tcst the revenue laws; underpunishment fprc,tited by Mr. IHerman Merivale, this miesarteorder of the borough, supported by SirC. tcmon, one of the 3LP.'s for the £vestern Division of Cornwall, in which Falniouth is situate. Letters from both these gentlemen, detailing their proceedings, shall, if desired, be fornarded to you. The original memorial is also, no doubt, to be had from the Treasury, anduntil the receipt of your letter neither I nor my colleagues ever heard that Mr. Perry was in any way instrmnental to the discharge of the parties alludedto. Mr. Perry states that, " in the present instance," .as in 1847, no "decent accommodation" could be found for some seamen, inmates of the gaol ; and alludes to and explains the provision made for six of the present prisoners, "lodged in two cells, having each a single bed only intended for one indiridual." With regard to this, the justices consider that the inspector must be under some misapprehension as to the date of his visit - no prisoner occupied a bed, nor was there either bed or bedplace in either of the cells alluded to. A large proprtion of the inmates are seamen, and, as best suited to theirKhabits, hammocks are providedfor their use, which are taken down during the day. In 1847 the number of inmates was 22, since that date the establishmenthas been much improved and extended. The number of inmates at the date of M1r. Perry's visit wns 14 ; there v.s consequently no crowding, as in 1847. Had there been such the magistrates would have again appealed to the proper authorities. The justices submit, therefore, that " decent accoimmodation" was provided at the date of the inspector's visit, and thfat the parallel he has drawn between the present state of thisgs and that of 1847 cannot hold. 2. With regard to the three other prisoners, I have to acquaint your Lord'ship that the dampness referred to was altogether of a temporary nature, and has been remedied by the repair of a cistern wYhich supplied a vwatercloset, while the chimnmey has been cured by lopping off the branches of a tree in the adjoining premises, whch overhung it and caused it to smoke. 3. When the weather is suitable each prisoner takes daily exercise for four or fivehours in the open air. Out of about 2,000 imnates, several of whom were confined for serious offences, only one has escaped, and he was soon afterwards recaptured. The reports annually made to the Home-office show that the health of the prisoners has been good; no death has taken place in the gaol for 20 years, and when cholera and other epideniics have prevailedwithout the walls of the establisliment those within! have enjoyed entire imnmiunity from such diseases. Tlle population of the mnnicipal borough is under 5,000 (in the midst of a population of about 10,000), and there are no borough funds except such as are raised by a rate. The council has of late years much improved the gaol and the management of it. and the justices feel that there is nothing in the arrangements calculated to show how greatly their (the prisoners') punish nent is aggravated by the defective accommodation of the prison. The Poor Law and other inspectors place themselves in direct personal communication with those persons who take upon themselves many onerous public duties, for the performance of which they receive no remuneration, and in visiting such establishments as they are paid to supervise such inspectors also enter a report in the proper books kept for that purpose. It is probable (althougli the justices are not aware of them), that there are good reasons why an inspector of prisons should act on principles opposite to those reco"nized by the other gentlemen alluded to ; but while I and my collcagues are impressed with the conviction that their vigilant attention should at aLl times be directed to the efficiency of the goaL, yet it has been a source of regret to thesn that Mr. Perry has never afforded them the opportunity of conferring personally with him; in which case they mught have derived advantage from his experience, while he would have prevented the necessity for your Lordship asking, and the borough jiistides affording, much, if not all, of the present explanation. Assuming, however, that it would have beenimproper or irregular that the inspector should put himself in communication with the justices, a report in the gaol books might not possibly have been open to objection. 3Mr. Perry, however, has not made any such, and the first intimation the justices received of the inspector's complaint was contained in your Lordship's letter. In conClusion, I have only to add that the visiting justices wiLl readily afford any frther explanation your Lordship may desire. I have the honour to be, my Lord, your Lordship's most obedient servants ;3. BItOUGHA34 Mayor.
FATAL BOAT Ac&mmNT.-On Wednesday morning, between 9 and 10 o'clock, the Alma shore boat, about 17 feet long, left Mutton-cove, Devonport, for Her Majesty's ship Exmouth, lying in the Soun The boat carried 12 ersons:-viz., Surgeon B. A. Anderson, Paymaster alters J. Bateman, Surgeon Charles Harper, Mr. Fielden, MIdshipman; Sergeant Stevens, Marine Artilleryman ' Mr. Best, Wardroom Steward; and Poyle and Toll, Marines, all belonging to the Esmouth; Matthews and anotherpersonin the service of an upholsterer at Plymouth,-andFairfoot and Iamble, watermen. The boat had her mainsail, foresail, and mizen set, and was steered by Mr. Harper. On nearing St. Niecholas Island Dr. Anderson proposed going to the eastward, but the watermen, who were in the fore part of the boat, said there wvas no danger. She, therefore, kept her course, and passed over the bridge of sunken rocks between the island and Mount-Edgeurbe. The. wind was southwest, not very strong; but the sea rolled heavily, and filed the overladen boat, which consequently went down. Those who could not swim clung to those -who could. The boat rose keel up, but soon sank from the number who got on her. She again reappeared, ganwale up, and was again borne down. At length a boat approached from the Sanspareil, incharge of LieutenantPloIlard, whorescued si. The Sanspareil's gig saved another. The boatmen y,ulled fmmediately for Bard's e utton-cove Inn, whero tesrs. Anderson, Hiarper, and Fielden promptly received - medical care, andare doin welL Best, thepsteaisdalso recovering. Stevens, Toh , and ear ble are injcured. f r. Bateman anad the other four eere unfortunately drowned.
