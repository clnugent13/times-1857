In some of the transactions which took place this morning a fall of 5s. was submitted to. Ths closng prices of the French Three Der Cents. en the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. 3Wk for money, and 67f. 70c. for the end of the month, showing a reaction of a quarter per cent. At Vienna, also, the market is slightly less firm. At Amsterdam Dutch stocks are a little lower, but ;Russian, Portuguese, and other descriptions-main,tain their late advamce. The continental advices continue generallyfavourable, although at Paris the rate of exchange has experienced a slight decline. At Hamburg money is rather easier, and the echange on London very firm. The recent advance in Russian stock has been followed by some considerable sales there. In 1olland the exchanges are well maintained. The trade reports from the provincial towns for the past week show that, whilethenew vfrom Vienna has created considerable animation, the feeling is nnanimous throughout the country not only against any premattue reliance being again placed upon Russian professions, but also against a discontinuance of the war except upon complete and unequivocal terms. At Mlanchester the notification 'was followd by a sudden influx of telegraphic orders from all pnarts, but althlough business was carried on to a hla extent, it was partly checked by the demiands of holders, and, the excitement having thus bee allowed time to subside, a calmer tone subsequently prevailed. At Birmingham it is considered the restoration of peace would f.vourably influence prices, since the demand for Goveniment armaments does not compensate for tbe prohibition of the export of iron to the nortSh of Euro;pe, and the general limitation of domuestic undertakings. For the present, however, tl.emzuz3et, which was previously healthy and firm, rcrnvainls without variation. In the genera-l occup,ationsof tQhe place there is fair employment for the onseEprng trade, but foreign orders are not so goodl as had been anticipated. The more favourable expl)ectations lately entertained of the assets of fhe Lichfield Bank are stated to have been diminished by a defalcation of nearly 8,0001. on the Tart of.a clerk, ancd other causes. From Nottinghiam the accounts are very satisfactory, piuchases on American account being still kept up, although the -wants of that country were supposed to have been fully supplied for the season. In the wooIlen districts al1so confidence is well maintained, and in the Irish linen-markets there has been increased ;activit. A recent trial in the Court of Queen's Bench of an insurance casce at Lloyd's has excited much attezition, the verdict apparently being little calCULiated to increase the confidence of mercantile men, whether at home or abroad,[in appealing to :Eiglish law upon points which depend in any way npcn commercial custom. Mr. Engelhardt,hof Iognot, on accotlt of thenetherlands sugar reSnery in Amsterdam, bought of MIessrs. Goodall, Olilltoji, nnd Co. a cargo of sug,ar w,hich had just arrived eff Plymonth from Bahia. On the cargo reaching Anisterdain it w;as found to be damaged. Lloyd's agent at that place immediately took the usual| steps. on the part of the underwriters; the injury Was duly ascertained to have been caused by seawater ; and the captain made the requisite declaration that itwas owing " solely to thelabouring of tbe ship and the gales encountered during the voyage." The loss amoiunted to 1,6681., or about 19 per cent. The underwriters for some time took no notice of the claim, hut after a lapse of three mcnths announced that they would contest it. An action 'was accordingly brought against them in the Court of Queen's Bench. The ground of resistance was, that, instead of the sugar having been damaged by the voyage, it was in a bad state at the timie it was shipued. The bill of lading disproved this, since it certfiied that the sugar had been " shipped in good orderandwell-conditioned;" butLord Campbellruled that "this was no evidence at all against the underwriters," and hence, as M1r. Engelhardt had mot simmnoned from Bahia the shippers (who have since failed and left the place) or witnesses fromI the plantations where the sugar was grown, the jury declared the claim to be invalid, and the underwriters free from all liability. The case was especially hard, because on no interpretation of it slould the loss have fallen upon the buyers of the sugar. Either the damage occurred during the voyage and the underwriters were liable, or the sugar purchase(d of Messrs. Goodall, Chilton, and Co., on the faith of a clean bill sf lading, was not 1, .- ading ___?I LU Die vncier these circumstances, 3Ir. Engelhardt has draln upana.ative of the proceedings,pointing outtohisbrotlier merchants the serious results involved in the decision. The chief of these is, that it mnust for the future weaken all reliance on the value of a clean bill of lading; but there are also two other points of only slightly lessUimportance-namely, the iDlustration it affords of the technical obstacles which may be interposed to the recovery of claims by buyers umder policies of insurance on floating cargoes, and the way in which nnderwriters at lloyd's wil disregard or set aside the acts of their own public agents. in this case, observes MIr. Engelhardt, "Lloyd's own agent at Amsterdam was a principal witness, and camie over to England to testify to the perfect regularity of the survey, the sale and all other proceedings in reference to the cargo, and to his firm belief in the justice of the claim." In conclusion, it is to be remarked that 3Mr. Engelhardt and his correspondents have been urged to appeal against the verdict, or try a new action. With their experience of legal technicalities and delays, however, they shrink from a further expenditure of labour, time, and nioney. " If the underwriters, r any of them"' they say, " are disposed to submit the case to practical comniercial men, whose decisionx would be prompt, just, and inexp?ensive, we are ready to join issue with them again, but not other7ise."' 't a meeting of the Union Bank of Australia, held to-day, MIr. X. J. (Yammins presiding, a dividend was declared at the rate of 27 per cent. per annum free of income-tax, and the.report and accounts were umaniuously adopted. It was stated that the prdence. exercised in maniagement has prevented any Leeous loss, and that ample provisionrhas been made tormeetbad and doubtful debts.

The additional floors to the Cutler-street w arehouses, the construction of which bad been suspended Xduring the winter months and was resumed in the spring, are now completed, and it is anticipated will afford a valuable increase of accommodation in that department to the China trade. At the half-yearlygeneral meeting in January, 1852, the completion of the south-west wing of F warehouse, at a cost of about 7,000!., was authorized by the proprietors, but the directors postponed the construction of that building until other orks which they deemed of more immedliate importance should have been finished. During the pst hi*lf-yesr it has been found that the requirements of trade render additional v-ault accomruodation in- these docks desirable, and the directors have therefore contracted for the completion of the abovementioned building with its vaults, and of vaults under the cart areas adjacent thereto, at a cost of between 10,000!. and 11,0001., which works are now in progress.

It wiD be remembered this was the ship that was ashore in the Bristol river two or three years back, and was said to have sustained irreparable damage. The departures from the port of London for the Australian colonies during the past week have comprised five vessels, two to Port Phillip, two to EobartTown, and one to Sydney,with an aggregate capacity of 3,419 tons.

BAILWAY D MININGHARE& i Monday ELsalng. There Was increased fihmness in the railway. market, and the operations in some cases were on a more extended scale. Midland, North-Western, Great Western, and York, Newcastle, and Berwick showeed the principal acivity. The shares of the Australian land and banldng companies were steady, with a moderate amount of business. In Canadaland, transactions took place at 137 and. 135, and they were finally quoted 133 to 138. 01ther descriptions exhibited littile change, miscelLaneous investments being generally neglected.
THE CORN TRADE. MtARK LANE, MONDAY AFT}!BlOm, JAN. 2L The arrivals last week consisted of a fair average supply, exports being limited to 7256sacks of flour. Of homegrown wheattherc were 6,141 quarters; of foreign 11,958; about 2,000 being from India, 5,000 fron Egypt, and the remainder from Spain and the Mediterranean. The supply from Essex and Rent this morning was fair, with the condition greatly deteriorated by the damp weather. This circumstance, with a continuance of Friday's paralysis, occasioned an alniost total cessation of:business, the low terms offered by buyers being deemed by holders below the necessity of the case-say 8s. per quarter; but a reduction of fully 5s. would have been accepted. There was a liberal supply of country flour-viz., 16,070 sacks, with 675 sacks and 6,275 barrels foreign. Norfolks were offered at 64s. American not pressed, both forpign and town-made quotations being nominal. Of barley there were 5,886 quarters English, with a fair sprinkling of samples this morning. The offers made were too low for acceptance, but prices may be generally con sidered 2s. to 3s. less. The sale of malt being stopped by events, quotations.were held nominally as last quoted. The supply of oats, without being heavy, exhibited great variety of samples. There were 11,023 quarters foreign, 4,656 quarters Scotch, 8,472 quarters Irish, and 6,252 quarters English-in all 24,822 quarters. The few sales made were at a reduction of Is. to Is. 6d. per quarter for foreign and British, and inferior Irish 2s. Of beans there were 1,678 quarters, rather more than half foreign. Of peas, entirely English, only 416 quarters. Both beans and peas were offered at 2s. per quarter abatement. Linseed from India was again plentiful-viz., 7,183 quarters. Prices cannot be relied on, but there was no pressure on the market. The cloverseed trade finds some movement at full prices for foreign, there being no English on show. Caiaryseed, bempseed, rapeseed, and other kinds much as last quoted. %U=UÂ±tSNI Â±'RWES OF BRITSH GRAIN AND FLOUR IN?

He states that he has successfuly reproduced one of our banknotes, and that he enclosed you, Sir, a copy of the initation. It is not your province to pass judgment on such points, or we shoild be quite willing to forward you a copy of the original, and then to leave it to yonr decision whether the print sent yon was a successful reproduction; but we are content to give the opinion of Mr. Granville Sharpe, the author of the work (Prize Emay on Bankirnj), which contained both original and copy. Mr. Sharpe requested us to funiish him with specimens of our work for insertion inhis Essay,. We sent him India proofs of a banker's note as a specimen of our ordinary work; we also informed him that, although the amateur forgers by the Anastatic process had nothithertobeenablesuccessFullytoimitate engravedcnotesof a su]Verior quality-and we did not believe they would-yet, as it wvas possible they might eventually attain sach a result, we had devised and patented a plan by which we could put them at defiance; and, sending him spedmens on bankmote paper of the same note, with this security added, all of which appear inthe work itself, with lr. Sharpe's comments as follows: -" Mr. Appel, from severe illness, being prevented from attending to the matt'er himself, the copies already taken have tured out a failure. If tine permits a second set will beprepared-itmust, however, be filiynnderstoodthatthese copies are taken from notes which have not been faced upon Messrs. Perkins and Co.'s newprocess, asshownat No. 3 A." The writer who cals that a successful reproduction which is thus characterized, needsanew dictionary. Whether the imitations of the postage stamps, a few of which were sent through the post at the instance of a Parliamnentary Committee, were equally successful, we cannot say, as we were never mnade awiare of the fact, had no opportunity of seeing them, and no reference was made to them either in our examination before the committee, or in the published report of that committee. As, however, we are quite willing to challenge Mr. Appel to prove his words on fair andreasonable terms, we hereby agree to deposit the sum of 2DO1. lwith any London banker if MIr. Appel will deposit l001., on the conditionthat if Mr. A. reproduces within a specified time (say one month) a note similar to that published in Mr. Granville Sharpe's book, as intended to defy the Anastatic precess, and of which many thousands are in circulation, to the satisfaction of an umpire of undoubtedimpariality andrespectability, he shallreceive the-whole stakes so deposited, but that, if he fails, we shall receive them; and, moreover, that if on receipt of an ordinary banker's check, printed on the patent green anti-Anastatic paper, such as Mr. Saunders, of Dartford, now supplies to the public, with Glys and Ap peI's name as the watermark, we do not transfer and reproduce that check in the presence of the nmpire, we will forfeit any sum Mr. Appal may name, provided he will forfeit an equalsumif we suceeed.

BANKEOTE FORGERIES BY THE AXASTATIC PROCESS. Advertmentl TO THE EDITCOR OF THE TIMES.

The foregoing circamstanoes alone would have been suM. dent to inflaence the Irish fanmer to reduoe,-or evem to suspend for a time his flax culture, had not another imlortantmatter fnally decidedlmany waverers to -apply their soil to other crops. The usnal supply of Russia liaxseedfor sowi, obtained during the tume of peaoe direct; from Riga, had to be brought byway of Prunsia, and,,the flrs choice of the land transporb across the Russian frontier being given to more valuable articles, great delay occurred, sothat much of the quantit7-in itself smIll-which came forward, did not amve until the end of the soivng season. In 1854, the spply of nev Riga seed being also small, oldc and inferior seed=ad been in numerous instances sown ana. esulted in dissappointment to the grower. Farmers,.therefore, warned by this, were unwilling last spring to ruan the risk of a similar failure; and, although a larger proportion than usual of home-saved seed was put into the ground, it. did not make up for the deficiency of foreign. Assas fully anticipated, the returns of the area sown with lar showed alarge fa1ing off. In 1E15 lB,403 acres haa b'een sown - ina155 only 917,192; being, in round numbers, a reduction of 35 per cent. But, although the fiures for 1855 appear very unsatisfactory, when placed beside those for the thre3 preceding years, during which flax cultivation made such a wond,rfully rapid progress, we find that they are only 1( per cent, under the averaAe of the eight years endedlS54, while, compared with te 53,863 acres of 1848 and the 60,314 of 1819, they are even verysatsfactorv. 'The crop of 1855 is afew thousand acres over that of 1850, so that we are, in fact, thrown back just five year3 by the untoward causes already detailed." 3A1L fl T5 GRf_MA r. As might have been expected, the prospect of peace has had the natural effect upon the Iri1h corn-markets, and already there has been a seriout fall in the prices of all kinds of grain. In some instances the recent continentl intelligence created a panic among the dealers, and sales upon any terms could hardly be realized, A few extracts from the notes of the leading country markets will show tha state of feeling:- "Corsu,.Jau. 19.-In the cornatrade in this citvthere was an utter cessation of business during the day. At the corn-market yesterday morning business was completely checked. Wheat fell 4s., and oats and barley 2s. per boarrel There were scarcely any purchases made, and sellers, in most instances, stored their cormn." " LEss.1cm, Jan. 18-In the grain-marlket this morn. ing, in consequence of the intelligence received yesterday, no grain was purchased, with a very partial exception, up to 12 o'clock, the buyers awaiting news either in confirna. tlion of or in contradiction to peace by magnetic telegrph. A large qunutityof lrainappearedinmarket, but the greater portion of it remained unsold. The quotations for oatss show a decline of from l3d. to t10d. per stone from Tuesday's prices. Barley, wlich lately sold at 173, was dis. posed of at l3d. per stone; and in red wheat we notimcd a considerable decline, although -verylittle except an odd loal appeared inmarket. This sudden fall in the prices of grain has created much sensation, and large quantities were brought back to the country unsold. In all descriptions of busineis a great dalness-indeed, we may add, a_partial paralysis-3revails; while the utmost excitement prevails among all classes of the citizens-the humbler classes, in particular, being overjoyed at the prospects of a speedy peace." "Bzarasr, Jani. 21-The corn trade, which had been receding for several days past, has got a final barrier placed on its operations by the report of peace. We were prepared for a change in value and a lessened disposition to puh but certainly couldnothave anticipated that,,even-were it; certainthabt all our antidpations ofthe cessationof war were fully realized, there should have been such a complete stagnation of trade in breadstnffs." "1 GAIWY, Jan. 20-The market this day was Unusually large, and abundantly supplied with grain. 'Up to a late hear few orno sales of any consequence had taken place, both buyers and sellers being utterly puzzled as to prices, caused by the news of Russia having accepted thepeace pro. positions suhnitted to her. After 2 'clock some stocks begantochange hands' slowly, but at considerable reduct:ons. Sellers are still holding on, and purchasers are f mid. The fact is, we are threatened, with all the reaction of peace prices, without any certainty of peace itself Inwheat there was a reduction of . 6d. per cwt ; in oats a fall of Id. per stone; and in harley a decline of is. 6d. yer barrel."

Aswe meet now personally we bad isetterspeak of business I have often heard that Mosbesh iss rantof peace and isdesirousof holdingpeacewith the whites. tam alsoa man of peace, and now in the presence of his chief men I wish to show him on what terms we may yn,kepeace andfriendship continue. As the best mode t 4 do so myview is that, as I am chosen on one side, and. Koehesh on the other, to see that peace is not interrupted, -we should, in case any disturbances occur, let each other $mow our ninds freely. I shall therefore tell him at once'that I have, on my arrival, been very sorry to hear of many thefts having been committed within our bounaryby wicked -people from the- other side. I would be glad to convince hin that such things mnst beput a stop to, or the consequences will be that they will put the country in a blaze, and dogreat harm to all. These are all the com- haints } know of as yet. Mr. Ford has alreadyrepresented She case to him, snd lhe has promised to punish the thieves, and putastop to the steaing. I have no doubt that he will prove hiamself aman of his w ord, and male his chiefs Isephim to carry outhis promises. " Mfohesh.-Feace is the mother of alL I admire what your Honour has mentioned. I would ie glad to hear any remarks of M1r. Ford's in confirmation. "President.-We will await your answer. "3foshesh-If no one dsespeaks it niayappearas if these were the words of only two people. "President.-I anc the rsepresentative of all my people, and my word is theirs also. T wish to hear the mind of )Iosheshls people through him as their chief. "Moshesh.-May the things we speak of asceid to heaveni! ly nuind looks on the twopersonages present as the first fruits of a newyear. I do not mind faults being mentioned, but I understood this to be a meeting of friendship. I met MIr. Ford about the faults now brought forward. I do not deny that some of the things have gone in our direction. I do not know the best means of stopping these things. lVhat has the Governor come for? Has he bseen sent by his master? Is there not a word of advica and wisdomn" I cannot bear the weight of alL You come from the Land of Chaka. If you have not seen him, you may have seen prints of him. He was ruined by his relations. Yon have wisdom to build beautiful houses of clay. We got all we have from the wh.tes, can we not make some p2an by wh'ch.we can enijoy what we have and keep peace Dr. Philip wrob to the E;nglish Government when we were in trouble, anl it aseistedus The complaints have not been sufficiently established. If you can show me the c.ause of dissatisfaction let me knon-. There I end. "President.-I wiMl take him up at the last word. The cause he must know, but the way is this,-his people come in and steal. The missionaries have been long enough in the country for them to know that stealin is wron. I believe that Moshesh has enough good men among his people to help hina to put down the wicked men who steal. I am gladto hear that he wishesto get advice. I wantit also. If we can both get adLice, 1, for my part, a.n ready to take it andlbe guidecby it. If hseis viuhngISt tako e advice from ihis E:ccellency, I am also. I wil state the cause of comnpLuint, and if he has any. I hope that he will state any ho anay have, and then if I can Iwvill remove it. I wvill- tell hima cIcarly in as few w ords as possible w.hat we complain ef. The thefts commnitted in 31r. Ford's district within two tears, as carefully collected by him from the field-cornets, amount to 297 head of breeding cattle. "a ,osheshl-I have already agreed avith 3r. Ford that I ras convinced that some cattle had been stolen, and I have made him promises. Can you not give me sonse advice? "President.-IfjlMosheshwillhisten will just tell him the zrmbers. "Moshesh.-It is jast what I wanted. ''Prcsident-Oxen and breeding cattle together, 363horses, 294: sheep, 112. I was not satisfied with thesinmplreturns of the field-cornets, and have instracted 3Mr. Ford to get statemnents on oath from the owners of stolen cattle. This is not yet completed, but is considerable. Sivce the numbers in the statement of the field-cornets have been accertained many more cattle have been stolen. When thefull amount is ascertained I will let Aloshesh know. I do not want to do anything unjust. I will examine the list mnself, and find out those for which Moshesh is answerable, and when this number has been ascertained I vill tell Moshesh. I have now ordered the Lamddrosts to send in monthly retarns of stoln cattle, with aU theparticulars of the theft, instead of allowing the list to accumulate for two years. I vwll teU hin also that it is not only from Yr. Ford's district that complaints are masde. I have received reports also from Mr. Orpen that thefts of horses are committed on the Winburg border. Some of the horses have been found with Molitsani, and some have been given up; others he refuses to return, siness the owners come to fetch them. This must not be. Xy people cannot be put to such expenses. He ought to have sent the stolen horses and thieves to inhbur", -where they would have been punished by us. SteMsing vwill never cease, unless the thieves are punished. 1ietaking stolen cattle from the thief is no ptnishment. He ough' also to he fned or receive corporal punishment. If the chief refuses to give up the thief he makes himself responsible. We put thieves in prison, and punish them wvien convicted. If he did so we would not have any snore stealing. He need not tell me that he has no power to lunish those who do wron-, for if they carn retake the stolen cattle thev can punish the tldef also. It is complained that MolitcaniharboursBushmen-anudotherthieves; oL&o, that Letsela occupies the lands of the farniers and makes gardens there. These are the very people whom Uoshesi promised Hofrman to remove last January. Molapa's people have also encroached, and Molapa, though he has promised to remove them, has not done so. I mention these things to show that they give rise to qu.arrels. MWy people will not submit to it any longer. NOwf, as he has asked my advice, I say that if his people wvill not obey bias he must m.ake thema. He must take his people against them. Those things that they shouldi not wishI us5 to do he must not do. He wroul>d not be satisfed if I said I could not help such things, if committed iyT my people. I Inow that they can do it, because sometimes for months long no thefts were comnitted; so, if they could stop the tlieving once, they could do so again, and there are other chiefs who never steal. I conclude, therefore, that those chiefs who will exercise their power can stop stealing. "Moshesh.-Can the names of those chiefs not be given? "President.-3oroko, Jan Bloem, Lepui, Adam Kok, and Waterboer. " Moshesh.-You mention those things, his Excellency eiing present. We must remember that wve are on a friendly -isit. Your honour must remember that you have Ijeen only a short time in the country. The Landdrost and . I, whohave long lived here, know better. The sword of the mouth is grievous. We had better not speak so, but separate in peace, aswe have met in peace. *' President.-I think the best way to secure peace is that friends meet and speak their minds. I have stated anl I have to say, and I wat 31oshesh to state any grievances he has to speak about. " hMoshesl.-Not to-day. "President.-Very good; I shall always be happy to hear from him about anything that is done wrong by my people, as wrar would only break us all down; but if there is any other thig, as his Excellency is present, of which he feels greved, I should be glad to hear it. o310shesh.-Not to-day. Let us go home. We can corHaspond by letter. "President.-Would he likehuisExcellency to give us wsome advice ?I "Moshesh.-It is not the proper day. His Excellency is sot hiere to hear dificulties. We can correspond by letter "President.-I thought Moshesh would wish it. "3dshesh.-Advice to a chief ought to be given in pri-ate, and not in blic. " President.-! en occasion is trgent we seize the first opportunity of meeting, and, if Moshesh postpones the conference on these urzent matters, some accident may occur, for which we may bfe sorry before we meet again. It may be long before we can meet again; it may not be easy for us to do so. We can write, but we may not understand each other so Mwell as by conversing. I have therefore spoken to him in his Excellency'spresence, in order that he might give us some advice, and that we might profit by it; and it would be a satisfaction to go home with the mutual conviction of having come to an understanding to correct what has been wron3g. "M 3osiesh.-I did not expect that the matters already settled with 3fr. Ford, and towlhom I have already given an answer, would be touched upon; and I have also given a paper to MEr. Venter, that people suffering from thefts should be sent to me. I am ready to hear advice. " President.-I k-now nothing of Mr. Venter's arrangement. He hlad no right to make onc. I w-as then in the country. Such a proposal as yours, that we should go into your country and search for.our property, could never be entertained. Mr. Venter was appointed with three others. The directions given by all to Mr. Ford were good, and ought not to have been broken by one. If I was to send my eople ian thlat way into your country, it would only make usputess, and break our friendships. 'Mosheh,-I did not come.to speak of business. "There seemed to be some misinterpretation of the Chief's meaningt in this last sentence, vrhich had been interpreted in English bylNehemiah, MSoshesh's son.

SHOCKING MURDER. BATHT JAN. 21. Great sensation has been created in this city by the per. petration of a brutal murder on Saturday night, when a woman named Eliza Howell, living in Avon-street, was licked in the abdomen by her husband, and her death ensued from h.emnorrhago in a few minutes after. The case is the more shocking from the fact that the unfortunate woman was very near her confinement, and the lifo of her child as well as her own has consequently been sacrificed to the brutaity of her husband. The prisoner, James Howell, was brought up before the magistrates at the Guildhall this (Mionday) morning for exasuination, when a zreat crowd of people were assembled in the market-place. lIoweU, who is about SO years of age, is a costermonger, and is wvell known about the streets as a hawker of ovsters, nuts, &c., under the sob'riquef of " Ferret." His wlife also carried about turnip greens, &c,, andwas aboutthesame age as her husbandbywlom she was so brutay murdered. Four children have beenthe fruit of their marriage, but they are all dead. The foUowing evidence was taken- JohnBrown, of 14, Avon-street, labourer, deposed,-I occupy two rooms on the garret floor, and the nrisoner and his wife the remaining room, adjoining my bedroom. The prisoner's room is separated from my bedroom by a wooden partition. Last Saturday night Iand my wife went to bed about half-past 11 o'clock. About half an hour afterwards 1 heard the prisoner come in and go into his own room. I heard hinsay, " I wil Idill the--cow; I will kill the some siefalso said, "God strike me dead, I'll do some miiscif an l oad drown myself." A bout 10 minutes anwen. heard the prisoner's wife come sairs, and v;hen outside the door she said, "Are you insie, Jim l" The prisoner replied, " Yes I am, you---- where have you been all night ?I His vife replied, " I was Llooking for you, but could not findyon." The risonerthen appeared to come out on the landing to push her into the room. He pushed her into the room, and heard the sound lof two blows. After the blows I heard something faU heavily, and the prisoner's wife cried out " Oh !" and said, " Jim, you have killed your child, and you have killed me." She then said, "Jim, look about and see what you have done." After she said that I heard the prisoner runnng downstairs as hard as he could, and his wifecaled out to my wife, ":Missus, for nierey sake, come in to me." My wife jumped out of bed and went into the prisoner's room. She screamed out, upon which I went to tha door, and heard the prisoner's wife saytomy ife, "He has kiDed me." My wife called out "Murder!" and I saw the room floor covered with blood. The prisoner's wife was lying on the floor. I was very muacl frightened and took my wife away, and then called out to the neighbours and the police. Prisoner.-Did I not, after coming in, take off my clothes and -o to bed? Witness.-I cannot say, as I was in my own bed. Prisoner.-Did I strike my wife when she came in? Witness.-I canmot say. I heard blows. Prisoner.-My wvife was taken very ill- The magistrates stopped the prisoner, and cautioned him that he stood in a very serious position, and had better not make any statement. Mary Brown, wife of the last witness, confirmed his statements, addinlg that she heard the prisoner say, "I'l give thee something and his wife, when she cname in said, "MfydearJim, areyoucome; areyouinside9? The prisoner said, "Yes, and El give thee something." His wife then wrent into the room, and I heard a noise [ like a kick; but did not know whether it wx-as against the bedside or w;hat. I afterwards heard the prisoner run downstairs, and his w-ife called out to me to come into her. I went into the room and saw the prisoners wife lying on the floor on her side, betweenthe bed and the firepLIce, and there was a quantity of blood about the room. She said, " Jim has killed me." I said, "I am sorry for it," and called out "Murder ' wvhen my husband came and pulled me away. The neighbours and the pohce afterwards came I have since seen the prisoner's wife dead. MIr. Hughes, chief of police, here applied for a remand till Wednesday, which the magistrates acceded to. It appears that the prisoner and his wife had been drinking together in the course of the evening, and had quarrelled at the Seven Dials publichonse, when the prisoner gave his wife a backhanded blow in the face. -He afterwards left, and the wife went away with another woman. After the affray, which caused the death of the wife, medical assistance was sent for, and Mr. W. A. Cox and Mr. J. Berrett, surgeons, were soon in attendance, but the unfortunate I woman bled to death in about 20 minutes. Her body was completely blanched, as was also that of her infant, whose life it was attempted ineffectually to save. The coroner's inquest has not yet been held.

He then went into the entry, aud took the axe and club and passed into the other room, placed them upon the floor, and sat dovin by the stove.

TIiEt1SEOP OF gXETEB AND DR. L USHIMG2ON. TO TIE EIDITOt OF THE ITIES.& &ir,-I have seen ir the public papers some extracts from the Bishop of Exeter's letter to Dr. Lushington, by which it appears that his Lordship, like, I believe, the great majority of Churchmen, approves and concurs in the general course and chief points of the learmedJudge's very ablo argment; but Iam sorry to find that from one prorainent topic of the judgment he has thought it necemsary to publish his elaborate dissent. Imean the question of what is called the " credence table"-a new-fangled foppery which, under an affected respect for one of our rabrics, a certain party have endeavoured to introduce into our churches. I have a great respect for the Bishop7s personal character, as vrell as for his eminent dignity; but that feeling only makes rne the more anxious to endeavour to convince him, or, at least, those whom his great authority might influence-asl have already convinced myself-that neither in the rubric, nor in the dictionary, nor in common sense, is there to be found any justificaticn orexcuse for this absurd, but mischievous (because mischievously intended) innovation. His Lordship seems to be at a loss to understand exactly either the origin or the precise meaning of the term " cre. denoe-table"'-very naturally, for he has never, I dare say, found it in any English author, nor in any English dictionary, nor, assuredly, in any English rabric. But does not the ignorance on such a point of so accomplished a scholar and so learned a divine almost decide, imo fac%o, the question against the side that he espouses? Oar Liturgy is nearly 300 years old, and th rubric in questgon about 200, but never, till the recent attempts, is this -strange word or now-fangled thing to be heard or read of in the ecclesiastical history of the church of England. Wheatley, indeed (misunderstanding,-as I think, the rubric), hit what he thought a blot in the rubric nearly 140 years ago ; but ho proposes no remedy for it, and makes no allusion to a credence table. He does not seem ever to have heard such a term, but he states that the same practice as now prevails was then also general and uniform; and we knowthat so it has continued to our own days. Wheatley's objection, therefore, has this value, thatit shows that ithas been for nearly140 year vvell known and utterly disregarded. I shall presently endeavour to show that both Wheatley and the Bishop of Exeter have probably misunderstood, and certainly misstated. the rubric, which is, in mny opinion, quito sufaicient to warrant that which has been the practice of the church ever since thdBrabric has existed; but I must here observe that even if the rabric were imperfect or inconsistent, the device of a credence table would not remove the supposed difricalty-it would only add a neow one; it would be placing the elephant on the back of the tortoise without finding a footing for the tortoise; it would be an attempt to support the rubric by the help of a credence table without having the shadow of an authority for the credence table itself-iynotuum per ignotiuss. Let us now see wvhat the rabric is which has given rise to this difficulty,-hlow. it has been, as I think, misunderstood, and by both Wheatleyand the Bishop of Exeter misstated. After the rubrical directions about the collection and disposal of alms there folowvs :-" And when there is a communion the priest shall then place upon thc table so much bread and wine as he shall think sufficient." Itmust be admitted that at first sight, and by ordinary construction, this would appear to mean that after the alm ! had been disposed oi the priest should then for the first time place the elements on the table; and the question raised is where the elements are to be previously deposited; on which point the rubric says nothing-a silencs' which Wheatley. who notices it, does not supply, but which the Bishop of Exeter would remedy by having within the rails of the ehancel and close to the communion table a sideboard, which they call (after the occasional practice of the church of Rome) a credence table-a practice which, as there is, we repeat, no colour for it in the rubric, it seems strange that the stickders for rubrical precision shonld be the parties to introduce. But let that' inconsistency pass, for we have to complain of more than inconsistency. Wheatley, in entering on the question, begins, more suo, by quoting the rabric,which (not more suo) he does inaccurately-tuius - " And if there be a communion the priest is then also to place upon the table so niuch bread and wine as he shall think suflicient." While the Bishop of Exet'er quotes it thus " And when there is a comniunlon the priests shall then (after tmeoeferto-synneneces) place upon the table so much bread and wine as he shall think requisi,in" I wil not accuse either Wheatley or the Bishop of unfair interpolation, though when the question was one of verbal criticism they certainly should have taken care to copy the ipsissi*nvercrba of the rubric; I acquit them of any intention to deceive, but I must say that it so happens that the alterations they lave presented-Wheatley by adding thse word "also," and the Bishop by introducing the parenthesis " after the offertory sentences"-have so changed the rubric thnt if-their version had been the trae one I should have been of their opinion, while, on the other hand, I am persuaded that the genuine rubric is perfectly consistent with the established usage. The point or gist, as the lawyers caU it, is the point of time at which the clements are to be-placed on the table; this I have said at first sight seems to be after the alms have been so placed, and Wheatley's addition and the Bishop's interpolation confinm, and would, indeed, establish, that construction; but what right had Wheatley to couple the alms and the elements by the word "also," and what right had the Bishop to explain the word " then" by restrictingit to the point of time immediately succeeding the sentences ? The usaal custom has been, when there is to be a communion, to place,hbefore the service begins, the vessels containing the elements at the back or inner side of the table, covered with a white lien cloth, -which, not immediately after the offertory services, but after the disposal of the alms, the priest removes and places,-that is, exhibits and arranges before the congregation; and all this is in perfect conformity with the rubric, if the word " then" be taken with reference to the antecedent " when,"-that is, when the fact of the communion being tobe administered hasbeen decided, which, as we are told by another rubric, and, indeed, by common sense, must be before any part of the service is oegun, for tha preliminary rubric to the whole service states that:-" The table at the communion time shall have a fair white linen cloth upon it ;" and it is " then"-that is, when it is settled that there is to be a communion, and that the table is preparatorily covered 'vith a fair linen cloth-that the elements are placed at the back of the table, to be uncovered and brought forward when the actual ceremony of consecration is about.to commence. Thus all becomes clear and plain; the two rubrics are reconciled and explain each other; not a word nor a letter of either is altered, and tho whole interpretation is consistent wvith, and further explained and corroborated by the universal and undeviating practice of the church ever since the rubric has existed. If this solution be admitted,-and it certainly is a possible and even a probable one,-there is an end of the question, and I need not examine another solution 'which would, hoivever, also warrant the general practice-namely, that the elements are directed to be, not carried to, nor put on, the table, but placeed-that is, arranged in the proper place for the ceremonial which is about to begin. Such an interpretation of the word is surely more rational than to assume the silence of the rubric as an authority to introduce the mysterious, though mnechanical novelty of a credence table. But if neither of these solutions were satisfactory, there is an all-snfficient justification for the present practice,- amely, uninterrupted usage. a Every one sees that the rubrics were not intended to be a full and perfct code.. They are in many important pointg very inconclusive-in some obscure, and even contradictory -and would be, in fact, a very insufficient guide in the administration of the Liturgical service, if they were not l elucidated and explained by the usages of the church; and inthis special case the undeviating usage is, we repeat, as old as the rabric itself. Even the strictness of our common lawadmits-as a maxim that communis amro facil jus-so that eve;i- if this interpretation were erroneous, it is so Common, so universal, so hitherto undisputed, that it may be taken on that wide gfound to be now the law of the church. Would a lawyer be fora moment lstened to who should attempt to pick a hole in the Habeas Corpus Act on some point which had been recognized and practised every dayandby every courtsince tbe first passing of the act ? Having thus,: I think,- shown that the verbal difficulty, if not altogether fitile, may be explained without any violation of the ordinary import of the words, and that, at all events, it is overruled by usage, the paramount interpreter of all law, I might here conclude, as I wish my sense of duty would permitxne to do; but I am sorry to fLnd in his Lordship's volunteer and extra-episcopal publication two or three corollar statements which, s I have attempted to auser any portion of his argument, I ought not to permit to pass unnoticed. His Lordship is very solicitous about the irreverence with which the loaf whicb is thereafter to become holy may be treated before it arrives at the holy table. He has heard, psolsjniiorf that such a loaf iwas once "broughttothe church in i churchwarden's pocket-handkerchief." This, I must be permitted to say, is an argument ad odium unworthy his Lordship's candour. Will he deny that it is the esenoe of the Anglican Euzhaist that the bread before consecration is ordinary bread, and liable to all the mauipulations and accidents of ordiuary bread ; but, above all, will he tell us howthe credence table is to obviate any such irreverence ? The bread would be supplied to the credence table by the chgrchwardea exictl' a it isa ow supplied to tho Gomz. maiosotal,e. I need not add a word more on su aestion * lpfly. invidious and illogical, except to observe that he rnight equally complain that the other element was brought iAn a common black bottle by the dirty hands of a wine merchsnth porter, and that, again, in a chureciwarden's pocket, to aU which accidents the elements would be at least as liabld on their way to the credence table. Such suggestions as these lead, I venture to think, to much more irreverence than the accident of the churchwarden's pocket-handkerchief, which may have been, and probably was, a fair linen cloth, but which, if not so brought, nmust hive como by his hands, or those of the baker's boy, as the loaf does for his Lordship's breakfast or dinner table, and as it must do even for his own credence table at Exeter. uBut, leaving, as I willingly do, these, I cannot but think, unhappy and irreverent fatilities, we arrive at a graver matter. His Lordship says that when one of his clergy consulted him as to a credence table, he, instead of discountenancing an admitted imnovation, bad advised him to " keep the table, but change the name." I cannot but think that in this short sentence the Bishop made more than one serious mistake. In the first place, it seems hardly consistent with frankness or good faith, nor at all in keeping with the bold and manly character of the Bishop of Exeter that he should not merely sanction, but suggst to a parochial clergyman to pass off a practice that was objected to by asuppressionor deceptive change of an obnoxious name, while the really obnoxious reality was maintained. The Bishop tells us that he deHberately thinks that this was wholesome and conciliatory advice, as it would give a triumph to neither party. His Lordship seems to think, and, indeed, says, 'atherepigrammaticaLly,thatthecriterion of a just judgment is that it should satisfy nobody; his. Lordship forgets that a judge who should award to in. justice, faud, or chicanery half what it pretends to may dissatisfy the knave in some degree, bnt he excites stil more strongly the indignation of the honest man who sees himself sacrificed to the judge's weakness- or prejudice. I do not subseribe to his Lordship's misanthropic doctrine, and, on the contrary, would conclude that a judgment which, as he confesses of his own, pleased nobody must be radically wrong. But, however that may be, his Lordship must allow me to say that this observation does not, in this particular case, show his usual sagacity, for I cannot conceive how the not using a name which never was and never could be used in the hearing of a congregation was in any degree to compensate them for the ostentatious intrusion into the holyplace of a material, visible, tangible piece offurniture, which (and not its name) was the point in dispute. But his Lordship's advice involves a stiU greater inconsistency, and seems to be the very reverse of what, for its professed purpose, it should have been. He wished, he says, to discourage any imitation of Popery; it seems, therefore, most illogical to proscribe the very innocent word " credence" while he sanctions the thing in a place and forapurpose peculiar to thePopish rituals. As the Bishop lays so much stress on the wvord, though he professes not very clearly to know its meaning, it maybe as vdellto inform hisLordship and remind your readers of what the commonest books ofreference tell us of this term-viz., that credenc, French credenza, Italian; )-redenkts, German; and ci-cdcntiO, Latin; all mean, primarily, a cupboard, press, or pantry, and, though probably derived from credo, crcdendimi -a place of trast-has no more reference to any religions creed or credence than the very analogous Eng 3ish word " safe' (though derived from salvo) has to spiritual salvation. Whether the cupboard, or sideboard used in the Romish churches derived their name from the domestic safe, or it from them, I know not, but the lexicographers seem to incline to the former opinion. We find in Baretti's Itatia1, DictionaryV, " Creden_a, asrn0rio, dore si ripongosn Ic cosc da massgyiere,-a buttery or pantry." No mention of any ecclesiastical use. Cotgrave translates " Credence,-siver plate, or a cupboard of silver plate." Menage, in his Dictionnaire ERtynmogiqzc, gives us " Credence-a buffet or sideboard on which silver plate is placed; of late, we say in France a credensier for a butler, and it is to be found in that sense in Baedelais. Credenft, in German, signifies a buffet." Ducange distinguishes the primary and secondary senses:-" Credentia -abacus, taeideca scu menea, iN. qua rasa, ad convrivia repo2zunttur, vel etiarn menisu7 se vasa a7taris colitilete," And even the Cerenmoniales Ronanum carries the matter no higher :-" C"redcntiaxm appellant ineensam, sutperI ouam vasa argentea sire aurea, ad conviriue opiportana. lnprarasitur: et similiter in dirinis, sulira putamn ad sacri.fcian,lie necessaria continCent1u:." You will not fail, Sir, to observe that these authoritiesall except Cotgrave, Rlomanists-distinctly refer to the Cessels and only as plate; there is no allusion to the elements, for which, therefore-the unconsecrated bread and wirc--the Bishop of Exeter would have us pay an ultraPopish reverence. And that this is the real motive of all this absurd fuss about a credence table is proved by the declaration in the concluding portion of his Lordship's letter, in which he enthusiastically avows that his main concern is to establish "the great Catholic doctrine and duty connected with the oblation of the elements." I have neither time, space, nor desire to enter into the doctrinal question of oblation. I will consider it only as the Bishop himself has introduced it, in its practical relation to the rubric and the credence table. An oblation is defined to be an offering for sacrifice, by which the thing offered acquires a holy or sacred character ;-that sacred character the Bishop, it seems, wishes to confer before the consecration on the elements, which, on the contrary, our church considers up to the momeLlt of consecration as mere bread and wine in their ordinary state. But if by " oblation" they obtain a degree of sanctification, it is obvious that the subsequent consecration must carry the sanctification a step higher-that is, in plain words and honest truth, to transubstaitlation and the real presence. This is, I am convinced, the clue to the whole affair. When the elements are placed on the communion table privately before serice begins there can be no offering up, nor any pretence of a preliminary sanctification. To afford a colour for that the Tractarians have tried several devices; sometimes the priest would leave the chancel and walk down or across the body of the church to a distant vestry-room, whence he would return, accompanied by his curates and assistants carrying the elements in a solemn procession. This prevailed for a time, but was so manifestly illegal (as the Bishop of Exeter ad. mits) that it was soon stopped, and after some other expe. dients the credence table is resorted to as a kind of subsanctuary, whence the elements are to be corami lpopuZo removed by the minister, and transferred with considerable state and solemnity to what these performers would willingly call the high altar, wherebeing presentedthey become sanctifi6d as an oblation, and have thus made their first step towards the glory of transubstantiation. This seems to me neither more or less than sheer Popery, and hardly in disguise. But where, after all, and in point of fact, can there be found any pretence or colonr for this theory of "oblation?' The Bishop answers "in the rabric, which directs the disposal of the 'alms,' and in the subsequent prayers for the Church militant, which provides for the disposalof 'alms and oblations;'" SO that there is, he alleges, a distinction between the alms, already disposed of, and the oblations, which can be nothing but the bread and wine. This is ingenious and perhaps plausible, but no more. The context of the offertory sentences, the rubric, and the prayer, offers the much' plainer and more natural explanation, -which the usage of two centuries has sanctioned-namely, that "alms and oblations" do not mean (as the Bishop assumes) different things, but one selfsame thing, under two-not different, but distinct though combined characters. The contributions of the commanicants to the poor are strictly and properly called " ahnds'-that is, elcemosynary relief-charity to our fellow creatures; bat when they have. been carried to the holy table and placed there in honour of God, it wouald be a solecism, even in language,, to call them' alms only, and they are, therefore, now more properly denominated " alms and oblation'-alms to man, oblations to God; and mark how clearly this double object is combined in the offertory sentences during the reading of which the alms are collected:- "That your god wol;ks may glorify your Father which is Ineavei." "To do good and to distribute forget not, for' with such sacrifice God is well pleased." ''"Hethathath pity on the poorlemideth tothe Lord.."

IAÂ£ BAAGHT, if.P., ON UAEPITAZ PWV7?I.EhX?. (From the Nandwser Exmnd.cr andE TMe.) iA public meeting of the ir,abitanti ef Rochdalo ws held -iie Town-h3JL on Friday evening, for ti2epurpose of hear. .ing alecture from MKr. Dymond, secretary Jo the Assoiation for the Abolition of Capital Punishm t, In fUvour of ,the principle advocated by the association. The 2:ttendance was numerous, and MIr. John Bright, 2LP., praddet^. Afr the lecture the hon. chaimian invited discuon, but, 's no one manifested aiy desire to speak, Mr. BlIrss hiMself rose and addressed the meeting. ThS hon. member ad,-I dare say if I were to ask Mr Dymond whether, In the varous meetings he has attended in this country during the last few years, he has not found that those meetings generally heartily went with him, he would answer in the affirmative. For myself, I have come to the conclusion, from watching this question for some years past, that the people of this coantry, except when they feel excited by a particular case, are not in favour of hanging, and never have been in favour of hanging fromn having made themselves masters of the facts and arguments on the subject. Nearly all we believe has clungtousfrom the days of our childhood-for it is wonderful how few things we have found out for onrselves-the traditions of past time, the siperstitions arising from them, the reverence for things no t worth reverencing, the laws, the reading of newspapers, common conversation, for instance; and it results from all this that. we admit things as trmths which, if we were truly to examine them, we should be horrified to find that we had ever given any sanction to. It hasbeen so at all times, and it is so now. In various countries things are practised as necessary that vwe should shudder at-that a woman, for example, should burn herself; upon the death of her husband; that a person should throw himself under the wheels of a car of some god that he does not know the name of exactly; that persons should undergo torments inflicted on themselves of the most terrible character, under the idea that theywere thus doing things that would be acceptable oto X,-all these things exist among people otherwise inteligent, and who could do various things in arts and sciences that perhaps some of us could not do, and yet because they have been brought up to believe in them, they have never called their truth or propriety into question. Now, just let us look at this hanging a that way. It is a veryold custom, puttin7 people to death in one form or another. Torture-not s nPlyhauC - ing, but torture of every description was practised in this country not very long ago, was the lawan Scotland not more than 100 years ago, and in manY countries it is now practised to a fearful extent. Don't let us suppose that because it is so old-for there is nothing so old as iniqtyit is worthy of veneration :ad respect. If I meet -ith a man who argues in favour of hanging, and listen to his conversation, I find that he uses exaetly the same arguments that were used 30 years ago in favour of hanging for all those offences that hMr. Dvmond has described. I remember reading a speech of Sir I oweil Buxton's in the House of Commons, in which he said that if a young man murdered his grandfather, or if he cut down a youngtree, then the law imposed just the same penalty for each offence. Some years ago more than 200 offences were punishable with death. A bloody and a horrible system of law grew up chiefly since the Pevolution of 1088; and durng the tine the present familyhave been on the throne of this country-and we have been under the government of an aristocracy assumed to be very enlightened, and a Government much more free than we had before that revolution-more than 200 offelnces, such as the stealing of a fowl, or of 5s. worth out of a shop, were punishable vsith death. Only conceive how per.^erted men's minds must have become by this commion custom of hanging to tolerate such things. I reco31eet hearing of the case of a woman w-hose husband had beenk kidnapped by the presegng and she stole something from a shop m Ludgate- g.we,for the sake of example, and to paresrve the property of ludgate-hill shopkeepers, she was hanged, and nobody at that timo was shocked at thematter. I have read the memoirs of Elizabeth Fxy-an excellent person, whom I consider it a happiness that I have been acquainted with-in which she describes that for the issuing of a bad half-crown, or a bad pound note, Persons were in Newgate in great numbers; and out of 20 or 30 convicted, the custom was to select a certain number-three or four, or eight or ten-and doom them to the gallows. This was common-at that time almost every week, in London-and the people passed by Newgate every week, and saw human beings strung up, sv. nging in the breeze, and separated after the xeseutioni; and the great statesmen of that generation never asked scarcely whetherthis horrible custom might not be mitigated or abolished. The werld, howrever, was not all in that darkness. There was one country in the world where the law was not so brutal,-a great country on the other side of the Atlantic, sprmgmg up from colonies founded by ourselves. In the year 10Th William Penn founded the state of Pennsylvania-that is, in the reign of Charles IL Consider how long ago that is. Now we are accustomed to fancy that we have made prodigious strides in science and everything else since that time; but when William Penn drew up the laws of Pennsylvania, assisted by the great and good men who were his helpers, they did not carry with them the 200 capital offences we had here, but stuck them all out, with the exception of one, that bein" the one we are now chiefly discussing-namely, capita5 punishment for murder. They retained that punishment for only aggravated cases of murder, and Penn is understood to have retained it only in deferenee to the wishes of others, and not from any belief in its necessity or propriety. The State of Pennsylvania is now a great commonwealth, and during the whole of the time that has elapsed since its foundation no person has been put to death in it for any crine save aggravated murder, and for even aggravated murderin extremely few cases. But your.great statesmenthat yon read of in your histories-the men that shone in the House of Lords and the House of Comumons-what were they doing then9 WVhy, extending this law for scores of offences ; and sinee William Penn's time many thousands have been ban-ed in this country for offences that never were espitsilypuamshed in Pennsylvania, and for which the p cut of death has since been abolished wiithout the slightest injury to any one. All the3se ersons, if the law were as rational as it was in Pennsylvama, would not have been executed, and I am satisfied tt.at it would have been of enormous advantage to the country if it had been so, for it is impassible to bring a human being into a street, in front of several hundred per*sons, and hang him, with all the indignity that you would treat adog with, without doing damage to the moral sense of every man and woman who shall gaze on that horrid spectacle. While such was the rtate of things in Pennsylvania-I take that merely as an example, for there are other countries I mniht mention-men were han;ed in this country needlessly; and during all that period yon had great authoritiesi for what you did. I recollt in Dublin some few years ago, and sitting> at table ne.xt to a judge on the Irish bench. I wfas discussing this question with him, and in the course of our conversation he said to me, "NTever take the opinions of judges on a question of that nature. They are accustomed to the thing. fl~hey'are brought up to look upon it from aparticular and peculiar point of view. If judges only had been consulted, you wouild probably stillbe hanging for horse stealing and shee p stealing, as you were a fewyeasrs age." I am happy to say there are, and have been, of late years not a fewv judges, and some of thehighest in character and repntation, who havehbeen quite willingthatthepnnishmeat of death should be abolished;i and we may e.xpect that the experience they receive, if they aremen of ordinay enlightenment, must bring them more and more to that conclusion..* But Governments do not like -to jart with any powrer, and they do not like to part with auy power over the lives of their subjects. For offences against the Sovereign, or the State look at the horrible punishment the law enacts. Hanging, cutting up, tearing out the heart, drawing, quartering, every description of cruelty was, ntil within a very short time since, the law, and a portion of these horrors is still the law with regard to offences that go under the name of high treason. These persons don't examine this question. Politicians are quite willing to do nothing except what they are driven to, and to make their gane of politics in things as they are if the people do not force a change. 'With regard to this question of hanging for murder, it has come before me in connexion with' a great number of cases in which I am glad to be associated with Mr. Dymond, more orless, in applications to the Home-office for a commutation of sentence, and in some of these cases there is the greatest inequality. I don't say this to bring a charge against any Secretary for the Home Department-an office I would not hold for the world, if I had to decide upon those cases of public executions con-. stautly brought before the holder ofthat office. Just observe the inequality. There was a trial lately at Darlington, in which, very properly, in my opinion, the person who was brought to trial was acquitted; but you all, I suppose, saw the -paragraph in the newsp:1pers to the effect that it cost several hundred pounds to niae his defence. The rich man, or the man of moderate means, can have the best counsel and the best care taken to have evidence in his favour, but the bullk of the men who come to be tried are ignorant, poor men, outcasts often, and they are brought before the judge in his 'official grb, and before all these lawyers into the comat; they ve been taken out of some prison in which they have been shut up, perhaps for weeks, without seeing any persons they knew; they have no counsel or no ittorney, or their friends may have subscribed the little money they-could raise, that a-defenee may be made. 'The judge asks one of the counsel, Mr.- So-and-So, to watch'the case'on behalf of the prisoner. Don!t you know perfectly well-that in the question oEf the guilt orinnocence-~-that in 'allthe, oonditions under which that man is brouaght to trial- ereasagreatnequalty, and' thatoneman tried underaI certain *set' of circumstances would .be xacqtitted,-and an- other man-tried under another- set 'of 'circumstances would infalliblbe convicted? How much depends onjurors-on their calmness, their clemency, intelligence, clearness. bene-: volence; nay, to descend to lower causes of difference, look' at the'very condition of their health, their stomachs, their tempers, at the time. Then you have the judge. There have been cases of this nature that have been urged to a sudden conelusion-the judge did not wish to go further that'nighVor hle id iot to have the trl postponedor adourned-until to-morrow. Juges ae men, notwihtaand-. ing thit they have wigs and gowns. - I know a good many of the jutdes, and have seen them on many occasions, and rm sure tey would be the lxs to deny that they woruld be effeoted by' all those influences from which none of us are exempt. - Then youome to tho Home Seoretary, and vish to nake an appeal to him. He, too, is liable to err, *ith the moet honest intentions, and is veryvaryingin temp6rinlthe consideration of these ases. I have gone' to inany:Hiome Secretaries in cases of this nature, and ia many instwices Ihaveofound that the convict has had his sentence comauted, 'and not be banged; while ofteni have found 'cases, 'as far as'I coild judge, not nearly so bad,in which the 'puishbment had been inflicted. I must say I bave found all the F.one Secretaries I over appied to willing to isten, ~andahiousthink. to'judge:nghtly; and,.altho uh, as you Euowr,'I am no friend, politically, to the pres,ent Prime >i~.iter,yetIwill say,' when hevwasEome Secretary,.I r'un( him on-more than one occa,sion very wvilling to lIteo. mad, in case of anything being abated that he thou,,hft would allow jim so to do. to z t the extrme pquieus of the law.

MANCHESTER COMAtERCIAL ASSOCLATIOX The annual meeting of 'this association took place yester. day, at Manchester, 3rr. 3. Aspinall Turner, the presideat, occupying the chair. Mrl. FAuiIMo, the secretary, read the annual rg'ort,' which detailed the proceedings of the association dUA4ing' past year. The CffuH nia, in the course of some observations in reference to the report, said he felt assured that the members of this association, while regretting the dire evils of tha war in which we were engaged, bad been fully sensible of the justice and propriety of this country entering into the contest. (Hear, hear.) The people of M1anchester had. borne cheerfully the sufferings entailed by the struggle, and be was quite satisfied that if there should exist any necessity for vigorously prosecating it still -further tlis communiqty would continue to exhibit tlek same feeling. (Hear, hear.) He sincerely hoped, h6wever. that the present hopes of peace might not prove illusory, and that-we should receive back our enemnes to terms of friendship, trusting that they would perceive the errorxc they hid committed, and learn-that there could be no true course for the security of Europp but that of muthal forbeasance and the desire for thc prosperity and liberty oÂ£ other n.ations as wrell as their owfn. (Hiear, hear.) Tie. state of mercantile affairs during the past year-had not been so disastrous as miht na 1 pectedL Althouoh the exports from this countrj uring the past year had not been generally remunerative, this was in some degree mitigated by the generally favouxablerenilts of returns; and he believed the merchants, at all events, had not had a very unprofitable year, although in some quarters there might have been diaiculties and loss. To our mnanufacturers he thought the result might have been- different; but to the operative classeshe believed ithad been a comparativelyprosterous year, for, although provisions hadl been hngh mn price, employment had been pretty constant. He then referred to some statistics of the increase, of our exports duting the last year which recently appeared in the Economist, and expressed a hope that any peace -which might be concluded would not deprive Us of te great advantages that had been gained bythe onening of the Bllack Sea to our coromerce. In referenceto Indiahewas glad to see signs of progress there by theaotrtion of railwrays; but he feared we had not yet ins author ity the right class o7f men to develope thes resources of the country. (Hlear, hear.) He recommended to the attention of -he directors for the ensuing year tha'c some endewvours should h7e mnade to pDrocure a modification of the excessive charges in the M1anchester Court of Bankrup?tcy. He had the authority of -M.fr. Comraissioner Skirrow for saying thatthe messenger of his own court hal received, betveen the 1st of January and 18th of December, 1S55, above 2,0001., out of which there actuallywent intoc the messenger's own pocket at least 1,4001. (Hear, hear.) The duties of such an oflhice certainly did not require a col- legiate' education, hut the talented person who now filliedit Wa5 receiving a larger income than many fuIlbencficed. clergymen in this country. ("H}ear," and laughter.) .- On the motion of Mr. W. R WooD, seconded by .r LAxizAr, the report was adopted; but a subsequent reselr tion was also unanimnously agreed to, correctir; the term "aggossiv6 war," in oieofth gaph sappliiti our invisioa of Russia, by strng out the first word, isin-. appropriate. The directors anl officers -for the ensuin yrea, were them appointed, .and the proceedings terminatck &

LONDON, TUESDAY, JANUARY 22, 185. Our foreign intelligence still runs in one current. Ve learn from Vienna that Russia " simply and unconditionally" accepted the propositions made by Austria and the Western Powers as the fundamental conditions of the fature treaty of peace. It may seem ungracious to ca-il at so gratifying an announcement, but stil we confess we should have been better pleased h4d the terms been offered to Rissia in a shape which would have admitted of their being made, not into the foundation of a treaty, but into the substantive treaty itself. It is very possible that in this we may be quite wrong. We respect diplomacy much, and should respect it a great deal more, had we not had such recent and rueful experience of the errors which it is possible for the most learned professors. of this occult .'and intricate science 'to commit. WVe have .not yet forgotten. the Vieina Note, which was to have delivered Turkey from the interference of Russia, only that, by the confession of its talented authors, it happened to have exactly the contrary effect; and we are still struggling in the meshes of the CLAYTroN-BuLwER Treaty, which, we are told, was intended to save rights that it does not save, and has added tenfold perplexity to an already intricate question. There Viight have been difficulties which we do not see in tendering to Russia a treaty for her execution, just as the seller of an estate tenders a conveyance to an unwilling piur chaser; but certainly no good reason couldbe given for the intentional circumlocutions and ambiguities with vwhich the terms are encumbered. Why could we not say in so many words that English and }renchConsulsmust be allowed to reside in the ports of the Black Sea, instead of talking about " institu" tionssanctioned bythe law of nations ?" and why could we not demand at once an undertaking not to fortify the Aland Isles, instead of veiling it under the pompous periphrasis of reserving to ourselves the right of proposing ulterior terms? These are merely verbal criticisms, but in such cases words are things, and things of immense consequence when they serve to retard a settlement which it is of the last importance should not be delayed for an unnecessary hour. The terms are accepted, purely, simply, and unconditionally. About them, therefore, if good faith is to be observed, there ought to be no dispute, and all that remains to be discussed is the best method of carrying them most effectually into execution. If we once depart from this simple and obvious rule, we shall be involved in interminable wranglings and discussions, and end by being either completely mystified, or perhaps cheated by the pen out of the advantage we have won by the sword. If we adhere steadily to the con- ditions agreed upon the matter can soon be closed; I at all events, we protest, after our experience Qf last year, against the necessity or policy of an . armistice. It is clearly our interest to have the question of peace or war decided as soon as possible, and we ought to take care as soon as we can that Russia shall have the same interest. Bnt t.ais she will not have if we once grant an armistice. Then it wiMl be worth her while to negotiate for the sake of negotiation, and apply all the wily arts of which she is the mistress to protract the breathing-time allowed her, and to use threats, promises, and intrigues, to sow i divisions in the councils of the allies, and among those German States whose allegianoe to their patronJandaprotector is-beginning perceptibly to waver. To us it is of no very great importance 'whether we have peace or war,. but it is of the very lasV impo;tance. 'thAt our councils should r:ot be diatacted. nor our attention diverted -by a statW of th#igs' which - is neither the one nor the other, but the whole advantage of which is with our enemy anad:gainst us. The best and first proof that we can ask of Russian sincerity is that the CzAB should be content to negotiate without requiring a suspension of hostilities. This will be a proof that negotiation is not to him an end, but a means, and that the' object he has in view is peace itself,' and not intrigue or delay. We may express a hope also that the,con-' ference may be confined to the belligerent Powers and to Austria, through whose good offices it was brought about. We hear a great deal now about the immense influence which Prusia has exercised at the Court of St. Petepsburg, and how it is by her instances, much more than those of Austria, that the chanOe in the dispositions of the EmpEROR was brought about. There are States, as well as individuals, who will witch a man struggling in the water without making the slightest en4eavowr to 'save him, and when he has reached the shore encumber him wvith superfluous help. If the worl of Prussia be thus all powerful, why has' she withheld it till now t Why has she been deploring aud making money out of the war, which a single earnest appeal from her would have been sufficient to stop ? In what capacity conld such a Power be admitted to the conference? Not as our ally, not as the ally of Russia, for she disclaims both characters; not as impartial, for she has been at no pains to conceal her predilections; not as a great Power, for of a great Power she has deliberately abdicated the honours and duties. E3er presence could only perplex, mystify, and protract, and give colourand encouragement to any attempt on the part of Russia to evade the obligations she has undertaken. Prussia has mediatized herself, and in the conference of great Powers there is no place for shams. We may also express a hope that the place of the conference will not be Vienna, nor any town of Eastern Germany. If it is to be neither Loildon nor Paris, let it be some such place as Frankfort. Franlfort is free from Pru3sian or Austrian influences, and is easily accessible to all the contracting parties. We should there breathe a freeer atmosphere, and escape the Russianizing inflience which occasioned so remarkable a transformation of our Plenipotentiary in the course of last spring. Indeed, as to this point, precautions, ought to be taken to prevent the country from being a second time exposed to discredit by the ignorance, the incapacity, or the vacillation of its representative. At a European conference like that now impending there is but one man who could worthily represent us,-one man in whose hands every Englishman would feel confident that the destinies of the country were safe, who would speak with an authority such as no one else could command, and in the presence of whose long experience and firm x resolution no diplomatic toutr de fiorce would be attempted. If the negotiation is to be long, it ought not to be entered into at all; if it is to be short, no man is so fit to conduct it as Lord PAUNEEISTOX. The Prime Minister of England, the leader of the House of Commons, is also at this moment the complete representative of the feeling and spirit of the English people, and in that, the highest character of the three, we trust he will not refuse hIis services to the nation which he has saved from disgrace and conducted to victory.
For the honour of our country, for the proof of our earnestness, and for the consoLation of the unfortunate people more directly visited by the scourge of war, it ought to be known that we also pay what may be called forced contributions. We may fairly place ourselves in the same category with the Christian villages of Bulgaria, the Tartars of the Crimea, and the natives generally all over that part of the world. It is true that we are not suddenly called on to entertain a corps of Turkish Irregulars on its march to the wvorld's end; no Bashi-Bazouks seize young Master HornvuL from the arms of his nLursemaid, and hold him over a cauildron of boiling oil till his father has paid more money than he ever possessed in the world; our arabas and mules, our stacks of hay and corn, are not seized and carried off, with no other return than a bit of paper, to be presented a thousand miles off, and taken into consideration at the end of the war. No doubt, it is an advantage to people nursed as we are in the warm lap of civilization to be spared these rougli processes. Yet we are substantially harrowTed and fleeced; we pay as heavy a blackmail as ever lowland grazier to the barelegged. occupants of the neighbouring pass. A personage of the miost iUustrious and predatory extraction winder the sun, the representative of- sea kings and Norman barons; aud conquerors, and crusaders, anid church spoilers, and HiglUand clanships wvitlhouit number, rends hei trusty agents, neither in armour nor tartan,,: nor yet in the simple majesty of the Pict, but with steel pen, inkllorn, and notebook, to demand a round sum in the coin of the reahm. It has been fixed by a secret tribunal of those wvorst of all assassins, yourrespectable neighbo,urs. Shouldyou demur, you are summoned to the Inquisition-the key of your treasiure-house wrenched from your hands-your hooks opened to intolerable lightyour credit, youzr prospects, your character placed at the mercy of your most candid friends; in fine, such an apparatus of scientific torture displayed to yolur eyes, that you give in at once, and pay the most iniquitous demand. Contrary to the first principle of natu=d philosophy, that out of nothing can come nothing, you pay a positive Income-tax out of a negative income, and go forth both plundered and dishonoured, inus7ts your mnoney and your self-esteem. It isvwith the greatest propriety that this is called a war-tax. The greatest extortions can plead an historic origin. "PnETE's pence" arise out of tlhe Crusades, and another tax out of the redemption of Christian captives. Danegelt waas levied at first to keep the Danes out, and eventually by the ]Daaes to keep themselves in. We paid Income-tax first to help the Russians against the French; we are now paying it to help the French against the Russians. If the war goes on we shall have to pay a good deal of it out of hand to our present allies. Its ultimate destination -we forbear to speculate uponi. Such is the forced contribution we are paying, in company with our fellow-reEgionists all over the East. So we must confess to a chord of sympathy with our inconvertible corTespondent, Mr. Mu-Tz. We cannot but agree with every wGord he says as to tho hardship of the Income-tax as now levied, or rather extorted. No ordinance of man, not excepting the Act of Confornity or the Thirty-iiine Articles, ever made so many hypocrites. . It makes them, too, the worst of all hypocrites-against themselves. It is a matter not only of known fact, but of evident necessity, that Income-tax is continually paid by insolvents and men on the very eve of bankruptcy. Thus, we have no doubt that Sir JoHw D. PAuL and Co. paid a good Income-tax to the last-of course, at the cost of their unfortunate creditors. In the late war we know the particulars of a case where a merchant in the Baltic trade paid for several years on an income of 10,0001. a-year, andcthen suddenly failed, paying -aomewlhaer about 6d. in the pound. He knew very well that his return would be whispered to every merchant in the trade. That is the gre'vaneq on: .-hich .Mr.. LMUNTrz most dijlates tie~ro7sm, -its pretended confidenc.e,. its : refined - ypo. crisy, and itfs real pressures Then) thesionly; mswer is that the tax cannot be collected in any other way. This Bashi-Bazouk's plea,' indeed, pervades the whole tax--the scale, as well as the manner of coUection. You are always told the difficulties are insurmountable. It is impossible to capitalize income, and everybody who has tried to devise a-tariff for the purpose has either com'mitte suicide or gone mad. The impossibility has become the strong point of the case. Those bold bad men, the Chancellors of the Exchequer, like Prince GoiTseHsxorF, intrench themselve3 on the plateau, of an incorrigible Incometax, and say,.s Mend us if you can." We may answer, as the farmer did to An xAwDEn Popp, that it would 1be eaier to make a new one altogether. But in these days the financial diggings have been so thoroughly exploitedc that it is not easy to find iirgin.soil, and people don't like going back to an old tax. So what is to be done? lWe have done our utmost, ad i at this moment have a very natural reluctance to dry up the sinews of war. We look to the Income-tax Refornn Association to do somethina for the cause besides mere taling. It can collect facts,-that is, of men who ought to pay the Income-tax, and do not; and of those who ought not, and do. Facts are sure to come in handy some day or other. The association suggests that rettrns be made on oath, as a substitute for the examination of accounts. But in these days people don't like taking oaths, especially when they are not quite sure it is the truth they are swearing to. - The Legislature has recently abolished thousands of oaths. Till lately it -was an ordinary thing for the captain of a ship clearing at the Ctustom-hoase to have to take dozens of oaths, all of them more or less false; he had always done so, and everybody else did so, and everybody knew the oaths were false oaths ; so the responsibility was thrown upon Government. Now, we doubt whether the Legislature will saddle itself with the responsibility of all the false swearing this change would give rise to. Notwithstanding what Mr. MuTrz and Mr. ScHozxsaxr.D say, and notwithstanding what we say, as to the exaggerated returns, it is plain and undeniable that the bulk of the returns are false in the other direction. They are too low, and the demnand for a capitalization of income points to that side of the grievance. That this is the general character of the returns fiom trade appears by the very sorry figurte they mal;e in the aggregate, comapared with returns from land and fimds, and by the comparison of the returns for whole shteets with simultaneous returns for compensation under improvement acts. When there is atalk of oaths, it must be remembered that we have to deal with the clasticity of the commercial conscience in its mnost elastic direction. We have to suppose a tradesmilan extricating an available income out of all sorts of drawbacks and all sorts of difficulties. He is sure to have fify itenms of expendituire which he will put down to his business or his private account, according to his own viewv of the subject. Now, if all is to be left to the security of an oath, we distinctlyforesee that from a dozen men with precisely the same income, and in the very same profession and circumstances, there wiU be all sorts of retuns with erery variety of conscience. We should be sorry to sanction a remedy so much wvorse tnan the disease. But, for the present, the association had best confine itself to the collection of facts. Let them remember that Clhancellors of the Exchequer always come down heavy with facts. With all the returns in every possible form, and an immense staff to foage for them, they are sure to overwhelm the unfortunate agitator who presents himself with his " view," his theory, and his sentimental appeals. We have not the least doubt that the Treasury could produce at a day's notice 10,000 cases of returns manifestly below the truth, yet accepted on the word of the taxpayer, and never questioned for a moment. Of course, there is too much reason to fear that, had an oath been required to backl up these returns, it would have been tendered without much hesitation. As to the project of capitalizing income, that is another affair, and the association can do nothing better than draw up the clraught of an amended Income and Property Tax Bill embodying this principle. No one will be more grateful to it for this service than ourselves.
From a far distant land we have tidings of a negotiation from which Vienna itself might borrow lessons of dignity. We can hardly hope that our readers will remember more than the name of Mosmsl, the great chief of the Basutas. In the days of profoumd European peace, when the arrival of a hippopotamus or the destruction of an applestal in the Park were stirring events, there was a certain number of persons who followed with something like interest the details of the Caffre -war. As the.state of hostility in those regions appeared to be chronic, and was the cause or pretext for the continuar ce of some unpopular imposts, the finaacial reformers were, of course, ready- to expose any failings in the conduct of a war or in the policy that led to it. .. About three years since they had a great opportunity for declamation. Englaud had won a Pyrrhic victory. The soldity of the British veteran had scarcely the advantage over the barbarian cavalry of the Orange River. The story of the campaign was as follows :-General CATHCART, whose name is now so well remembered in connexion witha fiercer and more famous struggle, entered the Orange River Sovereignty to settle disputes between AIosuxsH and the far-mers of the sovereignty, who complaineed of his depredations. The case had been, it seems, previously investigated, and it had been decided that MO1sISExs should pay a certain fine. The Governor arrived in the district, and commnanded the chIief to send in within three days 10,000 head of cattle and 1,000 horses, threatening in default to take them himself, or to make reprisals. MosUsEH came into camp next day in a con-] ciliatory spirit. Be had a " parley" with the i Governor, and. promised to do what he could. In a few days his son Nr.Huixirl came in with 3,500 head of cattle. The next day, as no more appeared, preparations were made for war. Several names, now known in connexion with events on; another field, were mentioned in the despatch re-; lating to the untoward incident whieh followed. Colonel Emsnu commLcanded in chief, the Hon. LmECsTvm CuVaZO led the Rifle Brigade, Captain PERCY HmErBERT the 43d Regiment. MbosEsr, though unwilling, was not unprepared for war. He ruled the most numerous and fiercest race of the plains north of the Orange River. Our conquests over the Ghikas led us to the territory of the Tanabookies; the subjugation of these only involved us with the Basutas, over whom MIosHEsE held sway with all the power of a superior genius. At "the battle of the Berea" he brought 6,000 horsemen into the field. The British had MUniM rifle and a demi-battery of artillery. Yet the battle lasted from sunrise to 8 o'clock in the evening. The enemy suffered severely, yet the continuance of the struggle seemed so unadvisable that the Governor receded from his demand for the 10,000 cattle, and was content with what had been surrendered and what had been captured after the combat. Three years have passed since this event. The Caffre war is almost forgotten. The burdens which it-laid on the nationseem trivial when compared with the enormous expenditure of European warfare. Statesmen have wisely judg,ed that little was. o be gained by the annexation of desert tracts, -:popi ated Witif tribes. 6qualy fierce, ;cunning, and dishonest. The -British Rla has retreated from beyond the Orange River; the :iuntry of the Basutas is far from the colonial frontier, and IosussU may rule and N=E- IAH eucceed him without interference. from us. - The Orange River is now independent; the property of the British Government, comprising the Legislative Palace and the Courts of Justice, the Barracks, and. the Pos-office, were made over to the inhabitants' for little more than 907., and the descendants of Dutch boors have organized a republic, wbich now appeam for the 'first time in the world of diplomacy. On the 5th of October last a conference took ;place betWeen the President. and MosHrH, the British Governor of the Cape, Sir G. GRFY, being present as a comMon friend. It is needless to say that -the Europeans wished to come to some conclusion on the great subject of cattle-stealing, and MOSHESH met them as a M'GaxooG or CA&bnox ~might have met a general of Cxomw9E or WrLLIAlr. It is not difficult to see thatthe 73asacheeftain is quite a match for his civilized brethren. When the-7> President speaks and then asks- for a reply 7 *MOB11PS will say nothing until the Goveraor expresses his opinion. MOSHiESH is higbly pious .r and biblical in phrase, but not to be out._. done in worldly shrewdnems. He has, no doubt, `profited much both from the teaching and example of the missionaries. "Peace is the mother "of all I admire what your Hononr has men- tioned. I do not deny that some of the stolen "things have gone in oLrr direction. I do not "know the best means of stopping it. Has the "Governor no words of advicer' The Gover- - nor, however, would not interfere, and the Peaident proceeded to urge his complaints. He said he could state the exact number of cattle stolen.. MosHnsH would be delighted to- hear it. It was read, and a positive assurance required that such delinquencies should not be repeated. It waould seem that the President's manner here be.came somewhat warm, and that DlosBRsu grew stil more polite and sententious. "The sword - "of the mouth is grievous." " We had better "not speak any longer on these things. We "came here on a friendly visit, and did not ex- pect to dispute." The President urges him to -- reply, and to state any grievance of his own. " Not to-day," says MosEnsu, " let us go home;. " we can correspond by letter." He stands on his dignity, and will hardly even listen to the Governor. "Advice to a chief ought to be given in " private, and not in public.", However, hi is willng to hear, and the Govemor delivers a lecture, in which he praises .MosnsSH for having, raised himself to so high a rank, and become the lawgiver of a most powerful nation. He hopes that the chief will " raise his barbarians in the scale of " civilization," trust to his own energies, avoid bad advisers, and leave off stealing cattle. "s We ought " to praise his Excellency for his words," is the cautiouls reply of MosHEsH. He then consents that lists of the stolen cattle should be nmade out, and promises to lay therm before the suspected delinquents; but he cannot bind himself to say that there shall be no more stealing, and concludes by preaching resignation to the plundered boors in a Pauline text, " We must by patience overcome " eviL" On the whole, his Honour the President and his EAcellency the Governorhave got verylittle out of MoSIESH. If there be comparison between the genius of civilized life and the untutored vit of the savage, we may find in the Basuta monarch some traces of the craft possessed so eminently by the countrymen of NassELRoDE and GonrTcsHAorr. To reply calmly to demands more or less warmly -urged, to ask on every possible occasion for eight-and-forty hours to consider, to deliver phrases of high-toned morality, and to assume an appearance of injured innocence, seems to be common to the policy of St.Petersburg and the capital of the Basutas. Sir G. GEYs, however, made use in the " parley" of a few words which will probably balance the diplomatic skill of his opponent,-" We cannot suffer a - nation of thieves on our borders. The Presi"dent and I are determined to put them down." The consciousness that this threat can be enforced will probably have its effect ; and to a similar feeling must we be indebted for the preservation of peace in more important parts of the -world.
There is quite enough of mystery and horror connected -with the investigation into the poisoning cases at Rugeley without any fresh complication. Difficult, however, as it is to anive at any satisfactory results from the very nature of the means probably adopted to cause death, and from the length of .time which in two of the cases has elapsed, a fresh class of incidents has been brought to light, almost as surprising as the alleged atrocities. We have been in the habit of believing. that the various post-offices of the* kingdom could be relied upon for the confidential transmission of the most important conmunuications; we have been in tlie habit of imagining that, whatever might be the occasional errors and prejudices of judges and juries, the stream of justice in these islands floweed on without intentional contamination. En both cases, as it appears, we have been in error. It now seems that the Coroner who is presiding over, the inquests which must primarily determine whether or not Mfr. 'WmLLt& PALMER is to be put upon his trial, and the Postmaster at Rugeley, through whose office the most momentous documents connected with the prosecution are forwarded, are in constant communication vith Mr. PAnnxm, and have been acting in his interest. The case as it stands against Mr. WViuo WEBB WAPrm, one of the Coroners for the county of Stafford, is bad enough; but as the investigation, as far as he is concerned, has not been completed, we will abstain from -ll comnment upon his conduct. Enough may be gathered from the brief statement of facts which we subjoin to show the nature of the charge against him. The Postmaster stands in a different predicament. In his case the evidence of the nitnesses is complete, and he has been committed to take his trial for a misdemeanour. The facts, as they were elicited in the cour-se of the investigation before the magistrates, were, then, briefly as follows M1r. GARDNEr., the solcitor for the prosecution in the case of Mr. CoorK, on the 2d of December last wrote to Dr. TATLoR, of Guy's Hospital, on the analysis of the dead man's intestines. Dr. TAYLOR received that letter on the 4th, and on the same day he wrote an answer, which he posted with his own hand in King WIlliam-street. Dr. TAYLOR mentioned that in the course of their analysis he and his colleague had not found, in the viscera traces of strychnia, prussic acid, or opium. He added, that it was beyond the reach of his s3ill to determine whether any strychnia had or had not been given just before death, but that tartar emetic might destroy life, if given in repeated doses. Mr. GAnDNER supposed, as he had a perfect right to suppose, that all Imowledge of this communication was confined to tho two physicians and himself. It turned out that the contents had been imparted to IPim, and by PAnsu to the Coroner, in some iBicit manner. Mr. GARDNEpR.S suspicions -were naturaly directed to the Postoffice at Rugeley, and he went there to aaako inquiries of the Postum.ter, Mh. CREssME. This person for some time hesita4ed, but 4 length said,. "The letter was lying open on the:table. I looeled at it,- and saw there .-was no poison "found. I - was so elated 1at I read "that prt of the lettei, .ai told it -b t "C Mr. P ": . Dr. TAYLOR, it -appear-d, had - used a common adhesive enveloie, -which, 3 he positively swore, 'Was w-e1l fastened when he potE the letter. The envelope was also gecurely gumn. med down when delivered to Mr. G"RD-,XP. CEnssnu, according to his own statement, went to P&naW's house with his letters in the morning of the 5th of December, and then commnunicated tohim the contents of Dr. TAsoges note. - As far as' the case against-the Postmasteris concerned it may be taken pro cobfcsso, and hiat person must abide* by the consequences of his misbonduct; but herofoloWs thle strangest part of the story.

SECOND EDITION. THE TIMES OFFICE, Tuesday .Morml1w. I EXPRESS FROM PARIS. - The following is the letter of our Paris corre. spondeut, dated yesterdSy, 6 p.m. . Now that we are supposed, rightly or wrongly, to be approaching the last stage of our troubles in the Russian question, a desperate effort is being madeto exalt the merits of Prussia; and if you believe her partisans it is to her decision and courage (I !) that we owe the pacific soltution -which, we are told, i3 imminent. It is no doubt true that, at the last moment, when the crisis was believed to be at hand, which Prussia could neither retard nor hasten, her Envoy at St. Petersburg received instructions from his Government to supportbI. F.sterhazy; to desist, in fact, from the support and encouragement he had previouisly given to Russia.. Prussia will try to squeeze herself into the Conferences that will soon be opened; but I doubt that she will succeed. Having said these few words, thefollowing letter fronm Berlin, under date of the 19th inst., will be easily understood:- I wIish to speak to you to-day only about Prussia, and that but in a fewwords, though the subject is not without interest. It cannot be indifferent to you, now that youa have th6 imporant news of the acceptance of the preliminaries of peace by Russia, to know accurately the part that Pmrssia has played in the negotiations which preceded and prepared this important act. That part has not been so anti-Western as many of your journals have descnrbed. At the last moment Prussia assumed a firm tone, and her representative at St. Petersburg supported the Austrian iUltimatli6n. This is certain, whatever yon may have heard to the contrary. Prussia modified her old policy from the moment she entrusted to Count Muanster the delicate mission of which you are alteady aware. During the interval which elapsed between the date of that mission and the King of Prussia's letter to the Emperor Alexander, her policy underwent various and very natural changes, so much so that it was at one time even supposed that Prussia, breaking definitively with the West, was about i to ally herself more closely than ever -with Russia. It was at that moment, that a portion of the English prems spoke fire and flame against Prussia, against her Government, and even against the King. These attacks were not likely to bring over Prussia, and had the intention been to complicato matters, and to fortify Prussia in her Russian tendencics, no better means could have been found. Fortunately, common sense prevailed. If our Government has been hurt at the censures passed on it, it has not allowed that feeling to be seen. It had not recourse to angry recriminations, and it lstened only to moderate and peaceful counsels. In reality, this tardy return to better sentiments, tardy but sure, on the part of Prssia ought not to surprise us. She postponed it as long as possible, and she only decided on adhering to the action of Austria when the irrefragable proof was before her, that the moment had at Last arrived to declare her sentiments. The moment which had come for Russia had also come for Prussia. "The Austrian sd1imatum, which fixed a short date for the definitive rupture of diplomatic relations, left no room for tergiversation. Russia, consulting her interests, accepted isurely and simply the vl4issolaum as preliminary of peace; and Prussia, on her side also, out of regard for her interests, supported the Austrian udtiasatuan. She supported it by the letter of her Sovereign to the Czar, and by the words of her representative at St. Petersburg. " The French Government ought to be satisfied with that co-operation at this decisive moment, all the mere that being so long delayed it must have produced great influence on the decision of the Emperor Alexander. I do not mean to say that the ultinatumn, without the support of the King of Prussia, would act have been accepted by Russia, but it is reasonable to suppose that the Czar, on seeing an ally, a friend hitherto so blindly devoted to him, and so unchangeable in his amity, speak in the same tone as Austria, felt that Germany had ceased to be a protecting barrier between hiis empire andtheWest,andthat thenceforth it was prudent to make concessions, which last year were declared impossible. The co-operation of Prussia has, therefore, a real value, which it would be ungraciouts to lessen. It ought to be acknowledged and appreciated. I cannot say whether it will make you forget all the hesitations that preceded it, but I believe that the Powers wi have due consideration for the difficulties of her situation, and which were rendered still greater by the bonds of relationship. " I repeat, the language held at St. Petersburg by the Representative of Prussia on the arrival of Count Esterhazy was firm and precise. Prussia did -not, it is trme, announco like Austria that she should recall her Ambassador on a certain day if the ultimativa waS not unconditionally accepted; but I learn in an excellent quarter that she caused it to be understood that the rejection of the uUirmatimn might, to use her ovtn words, 'compel her to adopt measures which she should much regret.' " As for xL de Nesselrode, who is clever at discovering secret thoughts under diplomatic forms, the hint was safficient for him. Prussia had never gone so far. The change was for Russia the loss of the last of her dearest and most cherished illtsions; she felt lierself alone, and she had no alteemative but resignation. Thus the wish expressed by the Emperor Napoleon in his appeal to the loyalty of Germany became realized. "And now, will Prussia have her place in the conferences wvich are about to open ? This is the question asked here in aU quarters. I do not venture to answer it." I do not think there is much difficulty in answering that question. It is not likely that a Power which not merely stood aloof from us in our greatest diffictLlties and dangers, but encouraged our enemy, and to a certain extent assisted him, should be admitted to share in the important negotiation because she had received notice from Russia when the moment came to simulate a zeal she never really felt. MIany people believe that the danger which impended over Russia appears to be passing away, though some doubt it. A good deal is said in one or two political circles of the mighty plans which had been matured and which were to have been realized in the nextcampaign. I do not vouch for the accuracy of all, or even a part, of what is said on the subject, though I do think it right to allude to it. Austria, it is affirmed, was to have put her armies in motion, and to have joined us in the field in April next. The day the first answer-the non-acceptance one-of Russia was known, a diplomatic agent of Prussia, then at Vienna, left in hot haste for Berlin, and it was stated, on high authority, that when the delay accorded by Austria to Russia expiredwithoutthe unconditional acceptance, a military convention between Austria, France, and England was to have been signed. An independent kingdom of Poland was to have been erected, composed of Posen (for which the permission of Prussia would not have been asked), Gailicia, and all that part of Poland now held by Russia. At the head of this new State an Austrian Archduke was to be placed, and, in addition to this inducement, Austria was tobe indemnified with the annexation of the Danubian Principalitiesi perhaps with the nonlinal suzeA.aindg of the Sultan.. The Italian Duchies;werest first to have been given to Piedmont, but Lombardy was not to be touched. This, however, Austria would not listen tp;, and she resisted-ny change:whtever i Italy.l The caumpaign, for which- England was well. prepared, was to have comprised the completae destruction of Cronstadt, tha. of the Russian- fleet, and the occupation of the provinces contiguous. We were to avoid repeating the great mistake of the first Napoleon; we would not have penetrated into RCussia, anld our head-quarters for the next winter would have been Waraw. If PRssia still held out, and refused the conditions which smem woultd have entitled us to expect, St. Petersburg would have been taken, Finland restored to Sweden in recompense for. her co-operation, and Runsia 'would be deprived for, an incalculable period of the power to intimidate or attack the weakest State. Such is said to bethe out- liunof the great plaunwith which the year wasto open.' I repeat that I do not guaantee its accuracy, but I should not be surprised if a part of the project was really in contemplation. 'I, as is affirmed, there was more than a fair prospect of sucoess, -one can easily iiaderstand the di&iappoinbtnent felt by those who were determined to finish once for all with the Riissian quetlon. It is said in some quarters that M. de Moray will be the Plenipotentiary for France at the coming Conferences, supposing them to be held abroad. I much doubt the correctness of the statement; it is to be hoped it is not correct. Such a nomination could hardly ho approved. M. de 3forny, it is said, takes no pains to conceal his sentiments respecting England and Englishmen, particularly since the news of the acceptance of the Austrian idtimnt'i4, has been known; andon morethan one occasion he is said to have expressed these sentiments in a manner not very flattering to our Government or our people. M. de Morny is, it appears, desirous of peace at any price; and, if the sentiments attributed to him are reallyentertained byliim, such aPlenipotentiazymust go to his work prejudiced in favour of any solution which arrests the war, and envenomed against the ally of the Sovereig'n he would represent on the occasion. His position at the Court invests hin, in the opinion of the public, with an influence which is doibtlessx saggeratedc; and when he inveighs against the Government still in alliance wvith his country, he is supposed by the ignorant and unreflecting to speak the sentiments of a still higher personage, and much jealousy and suspicion and illwill may be the cons.squence. Of his nomination as Plenipotentiary I doiubt, though it was one of the rumours on the Bour.se and elsewhere. A letter from Kinliurn of the 5th inst. announces the arrival in that fortress of the French General of Artillery Le B(euf. The General had visited the fortifications of the place and the means of defence afforded by the flotilla, and pronounced the plaece to be in a condition to repel successfully any attack of the enemy. According to the report of deserters, an attack was to be made on the 6th. The Russians, they stated, had concentrated 1G,000 or 18,000 men at Oczakoff, and had assembled another corps close to the isthlmus of Kinbourn, so as to attack simultaneously on two points. The first was to cross over on the ice, with 20 pieces of artiUlery, while the other was to attack in front. In the night of the 3d two English armed boats proceeded to reconnoitre the coast of the Isthmu ,, on the Black Sea side, but, after exchanging a few shots with the Cossacks, they returned without having been able to ascertain the position or force of the enemy. In the morning of the 5th, GeneralLe Bceuf proceeded in the MIilan steamer on a reconnaissance in the same direction, but without discovering any large body of troops. On the 4th the Phldgdton explored the coast of Oczakoff, and perceived no hostile movement. The garrison and flotilla, however, were on the qzi tire, and well prepared, and determined to give the assailants a wvarm reception. On the 5th a funeral service was celebrated in honour of Admiral Bruat, on board the Vantour, on which the Superior Commander of the Statiou, M. Paris, had hoisted his flag. The acceptance of the Austrian nIffi:mo,tu by Russia is too recent to have produced as yet any beneficial effect on the trade of Paris, but most sanguine expectatio-as are founded on the consequences of that event by the mercantile classes of that capital. Commission agents seldom renew the,r purchases before the latter end of January, and their importance vill necessarily depend on the result of the negotiations for the re-establishment of peace. The mannfacturers of tissues are busily engaged preparing their patterns for spring, but they have hitherto received few orders. The price of cotton andI woollen cloths has not materially improved, while that of silk continues to increase. The Lyons manufacturers are aetively at worlk, and the American agents have been obliged to extend the delay they had assigned to them for the completion of their orders, which, from the press of labour and want of hands, could not be executed within the stipulated time. The following private telegraphic despatches have been received 1 MARSMEILES, JiNr. 20. "The Jourdain steam packet has just arrived, with news from Constantinople to the 10th. General Bazaine had returned to SebastopoL "The accounts from the Crimea are to the Gth. The cannonade from the northern forts was still kept up. " The wveather continued very cold. "An expedition into Georgia, under General Campbell, was seriously talked of. "General Williams is still at Tiflis." "Z MIASEIMLES, JA?r: 20, EvxmxNG.

The Shah declined the mediation of France the moment lie heard of the fall of Ears. The English Minister, on his side, refused to make any concessions, and has left Teheran with all the English Legation. He arrived on the 6th December at Kious, near Mossoul. " The Prince of Servia has dismissed the editor of a Ser. vian journal for having published an article extracted from the Northern Bee of St. Petersburg." The Emperor and Empress yesterday received several foreigners of distinction, who were presented by the Apostolic Nuncio, the Ministers of Austria, Bavaria, Wirtemberg, and Mecklenburg-Schwerin. his Excellency the British Ambassador presentedto their 7Latjesties Sir William, Lady, and the Misses Clay, General DervilIe, and Lieutenant-Colonel Airey. The EmpeTor yesterday gave a private audience to M. Olozaga, the Spanish Minister, recently returned to Paris from Spain. The Moniteur contains a decree for organising the artillery of the Imperial Guard. Instructions have been sent by the Minister of War to the Generalse ommanding military divisions and sub-divisions, for the distribution of the English medal to military men of all ranks who have taken part in th6 campaign of the Crimea, and who are now in France. A decree in the Moniteur fixes the import duty on raw wool and articles composed of wool as follows :-Common in greae, by French vesels from out of Europe, 5f. per 100 kilos; other countries, lOf.; by foreign vessels, 15f.; fine, 10f., 15f., and 20f. respectively; washed, commnon, 10f., 20f., and 25f.; fine, 22f. iOc., 32f. 5Oc., and 37f. 50c;.When imported by land from frontier coun- tries tife duty is'the, same as when brought by, FrenFcl vessels, 'nd. from other countries the tame. as by forein vessels. Thread of pure worted in grease, 321., 56f., and 801. per 100 kilog., according to weight and fuienies; washed, - 40E., 70f., ind 1001.; thread of fine wool and silk, containing at least 85 per cent. of the former, 90f.'; thread of fine wool' and floss silk or other substances containing at least one-ha]f wool, 6..; cloth kreseymeres and similar tiisues, according to weight and fineness, 70f., 105f., and 150f.; light tissues, 60f., 85f., and llM., blanketsand counterpanes, 45f., 55f., and 65f. ; Oriental hosiery, 120., 13f., and 150f. ; woven goods of woolmixed with other substances, according to quality and the proportion of wool, 25f.; 35f., to 90f. The prospect of peace with Russiahasoonsiderably depre'sed our corn market, on'which a strong up. ward movement had manifested itself in the begin. ning of the week. In Paris, as iVll a3 on the principal provincial markets, buyers have -withdrawn, and ,ellers 'in their anxiety to dispose of their stoclc have been compelled to make immediate con_ cessions. Thus in Paris the fall in the price of flour amounted to between 4f. and 5f. per sack of 157 kilogrammes. The supply at the Balle excceds 25,000 metrical quintals, with a tendency to augment still more, which induces bakers to abstain from concluding any bargain on speculation. Little business is doing in wheat. A downward reaction took place in all the country markets on Saturday, but the retrograde movement was not so decided as that of Paris. At Chairtres, however, there was a fall of 2f. per liectolitre. On otherpoints sellers refused to part with their grain on the terms offered by mnilers. Most of the markets were abundantly supplied. On the same day wheat declined 2f. per hectolitre at Marseilles. The price of flour is now oily 5c. above' the assize bf the ldogramme of bread, which the city of Paris maintains at 50oc. Next fortnight it will, in all probability, have fallen below that assize, so as to compensate the city for the inimense sacrifices it has thereby incurred for the last two years, and whlich it would be impossible for it to continue much longer. The 80 economical food kitchens, established at their own expense by the Emperor and Empress, have admirably succeeded. Placed under the direction of the Sisters of Charity, they sell, or rather distribute, food of excellent quality every day, from 9 o'clock a.m. to 4 p.n., to a multitude of indigent consmners. The philanthropic undertaking of M. Delamnarre, known -by the name of " Cheap Life Docks," where every necessary of life maybe had, genuine, umadulterated, and on reasonable terms, has comnmnenced operations under the most favourable auispices. The price of cattle still maintains itself high. There is no change in the wine market at Bercy, and no abatement is anticipated before the period when some idea may be formed with regard to the result of the next v%intage. The Afonitewr publishes the returns of the principal nierchandize imported into France in 1855, together with the Customs duties levied thereon, which amounted to 189,704,690f. Compared with the receipts of 1854, there is an increase in 1855 of 39,117,387f. The salt ta.x produced 35,195,117f., or 1,914,460f. more than in 185. The nmiiber of vessels which entered the French ports in 1835 was 23,016, measuring 3,304,765 tons. Of those vessels, 9,574, measuring 1,247,452 tons, were Frenclh, and 13,442, measuring 2,057,313 tons, were foreign. In the same year, 13,810 vessels, measiuing 2,034,655 tons, cleared out of the French ports, viz., French, 5,756, measuring 934,598 tons; and foreign, 8,054, measuring 1,100,057 tons. The following are the last returns of the gross receipts of the principal French railways:- The Three per Cents. closed to-day at G7f. 70c. for the end of the month; the Four-and-a-Half per Cents. at 94f.; and the new Loan at 68f. 35c.; Orleans Railway Shares, 1,185f.; Great Northern, 895f.; Strasbiurg, 912f. 50c.; New Shares, 775f..; Paris and Lyons, 1,1 7f. 50c.; Lyons to the MIediterranean, 1,295f.; Western of France, 788f. 75c.; Bordeaux and Cette,. 700f.; Great Central of France, 585f.; Lyons and Geneva, 700Lf; Bank of Credit Mobilier, 1,432f. 50c.; Austrian Railways, 782f. 50c.

During the last two days the representatives of the Western Powers have had frequent and prolonged conferences with the Austrian Ministerfor ForeiÂ¢n Affairs, and it is known that the following two questions are now under discussion :-On what terms is the armistice to be concluded, and how long is it to last ? 'When and where is the Peace Congress to meet? Naturally no positive information can be given on either subject, but it is believed-as has already been stated-that the armistice Will be concluded on the principle of "u tipossidetis," and last until the end of March or middle of ApriL Either Brussels or Aachen (Aix-laChapelle) is likely to be the seat of the future Peace Congress or Conference. The propositions of the Allies, duly signed by the Russian Government, are already on their way back to Vienna. Nothing has transDired relative to the letter which Count Stackelberg is said to have brought from the Czar to theEmperorFrancis Joseph. P'rinceGortachakoff received the news of the acceptance of the propositions of the Allies while he was at table with Colonel MIanteuffel, who was his guest. The Russian despatch containing the important intelligence did not reach this city until nearly two hours after the arrival of that from Count Valentine Esterhazy. The high finance, which is still in a state of complete inoral intoxication, does not for a moraelit doabt that peace will be concluded before the spring, and nsy quotation of our old adage, "There's many a slip 'twixt cup and lip," was yesterday evening very i;l received. Various observations which have reached my ear during the last four and twenty hours- induce me to believe that Austria is of opinion that Russia has a right to retain all her fortifliedplaceson the differentcoasts of theBlackSea, and if such should prove to be the case] it is feared that a serious difference of opinion will arise between the allies. "Russia," says a very well-informed person, "hasbeen obliged to promiise not to have arsc?wls in the Black Sea; becanse they wouldfupply her wii tiiemeans fagrssion, but her forts are necessary for the defence of her territory." The upper pait of the back of Austrian heads, where the orgaiu of self-esteem is supposed to hie, .must be unusUllyo -developed; for it is here stoutly.maintained that. tie diplomacy of the Imperial. Cabinet has dehe more towards the solution of the Oiental difficulty than the arms of the Western Powers. This overweening conceit is not confined 'to the lowerand middle classes, and therearenenof high standing in ihis city who firmly believe that at the present moment the fate of Europe rests exclusively in the hands of Austria. Severalof the; -daily papers have had leaders written in the spirit to jhichalhision has been made, but the OesterreekAisc7e &7nrespzdemzz displays more tact, as you wll see by the following article,which bears trtue Foreign-office stamp:- "Glad tidings are now circulating throuaghout EuropeI Russia has unconditionally accepted-the propositions of the allies as the basis of the fature negotiations for peace., Loyally offeredl and loyally accepted, we' have a right to hope that they will lead to a peace which shall b lasting and honourable for all parties I. "The moaeration and disinterestedness which the Decemberallieshavenmanifested during the war-which-has not been waged with a view to conquest or from' selfish motives-will doubtless be displrtydaduring the negotiations for a defnitivo peace. We can confiadently say that the lwperiasi Russian Cabinet, which has now so honourably listened to the voice of Austria, will manifest thesame spirit during the future negotiations. !" The fundamental principles are- , "That the Ottoman Empire shall be under the guarantee of :Europeanr international law, and its integrity secured against =ny future menace or danger. The condition of the countries under its protection shaU be satisfactorily settled. All the banks of the Danube (of its different arms) shall be open to the trading world. The security of the rights of the Sultan's Christian subjects shall be confirmed, and that by his own voluntarv and magnanimousmarrangerhents. "By the settlement of such greatand important matters the interests, the peace, and tho welfare of this part of the world will be so furthered that all separate aims and plans will bc frustrated, and even the Emperor Alexander will ba richly rewarded forhis magnanimous resolvoby theblessing of his own nation. " The Austrian may look- with pride upon the part which his fatherland, by its attitude and policy, has taken in recent events." The article, in conclusion, refers to. the co-operation " in principle " which the Federal States are "sure to give" to Austria; but everything connected weith the Bund inspires plain-sailing Englishmen with such, disgust that your readers will probably feel grateful to me for suppressing the para, graph. On the l7th, in the morning, the following despatch was received from Berlin -_ "?russia has employed al1 herinfluence at St. Peersburg in order to bring about peace, and it is to be expected that the Enssian Cabinet will not be deaf to its remonstrances." As it is notorious that the news of the unconditional acceptance of the conditions of peace by the Russian Government was telegraphed to Berlin at 8 o'clock in the evening of the 16th, the foregoing despatch has led to some very caustic remarks on the "2iachhi,xende" (hobbling or halting) policy of Prussia. General Li;ders hasbeen appointed Connnander-inChief of th:e armies in S6uthern Russia and in the Crimea. "PrinceGortschakolffis to have another appointment." In General Lilders the allies will find a verys kilfulandenterprisingcommander, and on reading the forugoing it may perhaps occur to you that wwhen the Russians first crossed thePruth, you learned from me that he was one of the most distinguished officers in the Russian service. My authority was ani Austrian oflicer, now deceased, who often used to say " that Luders was by far the best man of the lot." Many changes have been made in the Austrian army. The Archduke Charles rFerdinand has. been appointed Adlatis to Coumt Wratislaw, the commander of the 1st army, which has its headquarters in this city. Prince Edmund Salhwarzenberg is to be Commander of the 3d Army-Corps, and Count Leiningen, of Constantinopolitan celebrity, is to command the 2d Army-Corps. Prince Edlward Liechtenstein has the 4th Axmy-Corps, and Baron Alemann the 10th. According to a telegraphic despatch received here yesterday, the firman relative to the Kostendje canal, was signed by the Sul-tan on the 11th January. When the Emperor appeared yesterday at the opera he was received with such prolonged applause that he was obliged to rise three several times. It appeared as if the audience wished to express its approbation of the recent policy of the Monarch. The Jesuits have purchased a pretty little castle and estate near Vienna, and are about to establish a seminary. The union of Moldavia andWVallachia into one province is still spoken of. We learn that the rear of Omar Pasha's army, which was under Ferhad Parsha, suffered greatly from the attacls of the Russians while retreating towvards the coast. M%Tajor Stewvat has succeeded General Williams as British Conmmissioner to the Tnrkish Army in Asia M-inor.. Things are progressing more smoothly in Greece, and some of the most dreaded robbers have been taken and executed. _ PRUSSIA. (FROM OUR ow0 COR ESPONDEN-T.) BBl;Ra, L.'r. 20. In spiteof eyeiy disavowalthat has proceeded froim Paris, and even..from Dresden, oin the suibject of Baron von $eebach's mission or journey to St. Petersburg, I think it right to nention the subject again, as being not without interest with reference to the approaching conferences. I have already informed you that he was understood, on his return, to be empowered by the Russian Government to "continue his endeavours for peace in the French capital on the principles already advocated by him at St. Petersburg." He is since then reported to me to have been empowered, in the event of conferences or a congress being brought about, or for the purpose of bringing one about, to make still further concessions than Were contained in Russia's first conditional acceptance. This plan has, however, been frustrated by the peremptory demand of an unconditional acceptance of the five points by Austria, maldng it incumbent on Russia at once, if she would not see the Austrian M1inister leave St. Petersburg, to accept them unconditionally, as far as words go. The result is, however, practically the same: whatever the words may be in which the preliminaries have been accepted, there must be conferences held to settle the adjustment of the details and application of the principles, in which it will be competent to Russia to bring forward new propositions and endeavour to malke them plausible and acceptable. The attitude observed hitherto byRussiatowards theAustrianpropoositions renders ithighlyimprobablethat she intends to saubmit to them in their presentform; and the nat re of the fiftlh demand, containing as it does only the unknown germ of various (officially) uncommunicated demands, is such that Russia cannot have accepted it unconditionally inthefullest sense of the word writhout actually surrendering at discretion. We shall find that Russia on inquiry in Vienna as to the nature of the demands involved in the fifth point, v.w.x% assured by Ausria thatthey wdre "of no great importance." When she ascertains to the contrary, we shall see that Russia has not so unconditionally accepted; she will reply that these demands are not made "in the interests of Europe," and will refuse to enter into any discussion on the subject. The last unconditional acceptance, with the reservation,v wil be found to amount to no more than the conditional refusal -with the subsequent concessions w6uld have been ; the "u nconditional' form of acceptance was merely adopted from the necessity of avoiding the diplomatic breach with Austria, which would have made any further conferences. very. diBicult: the actual result will remain the same in botheases. In a ddition'to the'lespatch formvaided to Prilne, :Gowhakoffi in.Vieiina by. the Russian Cabinet, 'CountEiaeTha 'hwas enabl,ed'to telegraph to hia own Governmint on the 16th inst.. that Count Nesselrode had lianded himan official. memorandumto the effect 'that Prince Gortschakoff was instructed to acempt unconditionaly the Austrian proposals; a preliminary convention, of . which they woiald formn the bases, is to be concluded in Vieniia.' Vienna 'letters, - emanating from good FOullls, mention the unmistakeable willingness of the .Emper'or Niapoleon to accept moderate conditions of peace as having been the influential1 motive at the last moment that induced the Russian Cabinet to .take the decisive step of an uncondito acp ance ; and,.'n wi th tol accept- d conneson . this deonstation -on- the pir of. the' Eperor of the French, the. :probability of Paris* being chosen as the''seat of the I coaferencies ie put forward. . -Whatever the actual issuef may be, the above remarks .will showrthat the mission of Baron Seebach has not been without intention or effect. c 'ount Benckendorf arrived here on Thursa.ay morning, having, like Count, Stack-plberg, been. much detained on the road, and, lie bi to, he was the bearer of despatches- and commnications which had long been suNerseded by the rapidity of the telegraph and 'the urgency of circumstanees. On the previons evening also Prince Labanioff, the Secretary of the Russina LegVation, arived here, brnging d f Petersburg; .nd within an hour of his irrival a courier was despatched back to the Russian capital. Those who profess to know somewhat of the tenour of the various despatches received on these occasions by the Russian Embassy, srate that they by no means favour the idea of an unconditional acceptance of every point that may be -brought forward at peace conferences., It is true hcwever that any sucnl despatches miust have been drawn up previous to the resolution having been taken in St. Petersburg to accept the proposals uncondition0lj. I am of opinion, however, that the use of this latter expression -will make verylittle difference in theactua results. Since the coirier above-mentioned was' despatched, another was sent off on Friday evening, in the person of Herr von Poggenpoul, the Russia;i' officieux contributor to the Nord, and who was to .have been the editor of that. paper if' the Belgian Government would have permitted him to reside in Brussels. SPAIN. (FrOM ounL owN coruinroPUnrs.) I mentioned yesterday that Senors Escosura and. Lujan had accepted the Home office and that oF' Public Works; Senor Arias hria, a deputy for Gallicia, and Presidenite de Sala of the Audieucia Gourt at Seville, has accepted the Ministry of Grace and Justice in place of Senor Fuente Andres, and. these three new Ministers were sworn in last night. The other, departments of the 3TEhiistry remain in the same hands as befoie.'' The members of the Cabinet presented them-' selves in the Cortes this afternoon, and 'the DuXe de la Victoria addressed the Assembly in a short speech, in which he stated that motives of delicacy had induced his colleagues to send in their' resigniations; that the Queen had deigned to acce&j)t those of three of them, and to approve of their successors, and he added someremarksabontthedesire. of tho Cabinettopromote the welfare of the country, &c. ; in short, he intimated that the policyof the :overumient would be the same as before. Senors I;asernaand AlonzoMartinez gave some explanation on' personal matters; and the latter said that he had left theMinistry because he disagreed with his former. colleagues on some points. It is understood that he particularly referred to the outrage committed on the dignity of the Cortes by the National Guards on duty there on the 7th, which he considered ought to have been dealt withl in a more enelrgetic and summary manner, an opinion pretty generally entertained here. The Assembly commenced at the close of yesterday's sittingg, and continued to-day, the discussioin of the report of the committee on the proposals 0of the ropresentvtives of the Credit Mobilier Company. and others for the establishment of an anonymows Company or Bank of Credit, which will, no doubt, be adopted. Another report in favour of a similar scheme, proposed to be carried out by various' Spanish and other' firms established here, W.as read and ordered to be printed. Some journals, both Spanish and, foreign, persist in stating that Lord Howden is on bad terms with. France. I am assured that this statement is withiout foundation. Hi lordship will have -a gcra&tdinner party on the 22d, including 40 guests, the' banquet being entirely 'in honour of the 'Frenbc. Ambassador and Anibassadres, and the day chosen by: themselves. The Committee on the Budget has approved: among various points an item of 5; mnillions of reals, to be paid to the French Govermnent, as indemnity for a vessel unduly captured, the amount being in conformity with the award of the King of Holland, to whose arbitration the matter was referred.

Anything more than aconjecture on any of these points would, however, certainly be pemature, seeirg that the offtial announcement of the RIusian acceptance of theAuatrianproposalsonly at i oennatyesterda. This announcement isproIMbly accompanied by a suggestion on the part of Austri a that a truce should be proclaimed between the armed forces pending the conference? wehich aihe will at the s3ne time invite kiland gan PRrance to attend. The place wvhere may sfely be assumed to be Vienna, as neutral 3rolnd and the capital ofthe qtanmediating Power. SkewQ are persons here so desirous of peace, and so aughine m their c:pectations, as positively, in spit&of all past expenence, to look upon the openSUg'of these peace conferences as though they were peace itself, or necessarily and inevitably leading to St, overlook-ing that already Russia's first grand vbjed - is attained by the Austian Mffinister otlhahnvg left St. Petersburg; while a secocll is in a fair waay of attainment-viz., Uhatof preventing Austria taiing any step further-as yet, and keeping her fixed in her present stoditum. In addition to the sanogune ones, . who, like Charity, "hope-all things and believe all things," there is a aufliciently numerous class of penimists here who have no doubt that Russia will continue to accept everything that may be urged upon her with sufficient emphasis is the three Powers in coalition, but are as certiin that Russia will avail herself of the first ootunlity to violate any and evewy treaty she may feel it imperative on her in the present crisis to con- lude. One reflection at least wil not escape any di&aassionate Englis-hman, that Russia has not yet beena i fficiently beaten (more particularly if looking at the status quo from the Russian point of .vripw) to mnake it imperative on her to conclude a. pete at present on terms dissatisfactory to herWUf;L and, therefore, if she does so, she must be driv.en to it by the consciousness of inward weaknes, which should inpel us to continuo the contest; orelse she is makiing amental reservation, and determining, " on somte fair future day," to evade any treatiei of peace that may be concluded on the pre'sent occasion, and therefore that we should not draw r.daSback fronthe work until its successi put beyondthe power of bad faith to futize it. It will aloo be highly necessary for ourCabinet to have a full atatemient of all the postulates included at present in the loose omnitmn gatherums of the fifth point drawn up and agreed to by the Russian Plenipotentiary, before proceeding to debate and procure the Russian adhesion to those first four points that are ' mainly of Austrian interest; otherwise, should this latter- Power find all its requirements in the first four points fulfilled by Russia, she will be little likely to remain stanch for the vindication of such lagatelles as- may chance to affect somebody eLs' interests in the Baltic. As Russia has not rejected the Austrian proposals the citation that it wvas intended to issue to Prussia, C%lliWig upon her to adopt the five points and to make the continuance of diplomatic relations with Russia dependent on their being accepted, will of course fal to the ground. On the other hand, tht: Cpening of peace conferences may probably cause thie question of Prussia's being invited to participite in them to be mooted. You wil find it atritly consistent with all that I have hitherto rritten yoa on this subject if I state to you my firm belief that this Government wil not only take no steps to procure admission to them, nor accept any invitation to participate in them, if made dependent oni its incurring any obligations or guarantees for the future. At the same time I cannot see what would e gained by her entrance into the common councils, seeing thiat the terms on which it is proposed to snake peace are not consonant with her interests, have not attained her assent in advance, and would Probably meet with but very faint advocacy on her part, if not absolute opposition. When articles of peace have been drawn up and settled and signed it wouId be time enough to invite Prussia's adhesion, as addidgi some small amount of moral validityand securitytthem, but, asI said above, this Government will certainly decline to accept any obligation in connexione with them. It has been bruited here that the Russian reply in acceptance of the Austrian pro. 3zosa stipulated for the admission of Prussia to the peace conferences thence to ensue; not only can I hear nothing in confirmation of this idea, but idil so much that is improbable in it that the report may be cancelled at once and put out of circulation. Just as unfounded is it that P:russia in its representations at St. Petersburg held out, that in case of Russia's refusal it would manke common cause with Austria and bring Germny at her back; all the urgent representations ahe has of late made in the Russian capital (and I ihear thlat as late as the 16th instant the telegraph conveyed one last very stringent appeal) have been entirely disconnected from Austria and the Western Powers, and were dictated by the motives indicated to you. in my letter published in your, Thursday's impression.

I THE ARMY IN THE CRIMEA. (FRON OUR OWIN OORRESPOHDE. CAMP BEFORBE SEBASTOPOIL J". 6. Yesterday was a model of a fine winter's day. The long icicles that fringed the eaves of the huts glittered inthebrightsun, the rays of whichtemperedasharp frost. It was the very day for pedestrians, and, not. withstanding that tho snow lay a foot deep on the ground, numerous walking parties were out, officera' ponies getting an unaccustomed holyday. Groups of younggentlemen,armedwith fowlingpieces andre. volvers, were seen saUying forth in pursuit of imaginary game, and returmnng with empty bags, having been, gratified by the distant view of a flock of bustards, by an overhead prospect of a flight of wild geese, or by a glimpse of a remote hare contemptuously observing them. It was a fatal day for the sparrows and larks, and, despite of standing orders, there was much popping of old Russian muskets and other futile firearms al about the camp. The Russians took advantage of the fine weather to hold a review of a large mass of infantry on the heights above Inkermann; and the LightDivision, having no foe to combat, divideditself intotwo brigades, and had afuriou3battle with snowballs. The engagement was hardly (not hotly) contested,and,althoughnobloodwas shed,l4officers and alarge number of men were made prisoners, and released only upon payment of a ransom of half-a-crown each officer and one penny each man. At night the cold increased, and this morning it is very severe. There is no wind, so we feel it the les, but still it is tolerably intense. Early ablutions were a struggle with nmasses of ice and towels stiff as boards, and which needed thawing ere they could be used. The water froze in the basin as one washed, and there is now at my chimney-corner a pail of water which has been there for some hours without becomiing entirely liquid. This weather, however, sharp though it be in such imperfect dwellings as most of those here, is far preferable to rain and mud, which constitateespecially when wind accompanies them-the se plus uZera of wretchedness in the Crimean camp. It is better, too, for the health of the army. We of course have some cases of frostbite (most of them trifling), and Ihear of a death having occurred in a tent, but I believe that, in many of such cases, the cold alone is not to blame, but often the intemperance of the sufferers. At the same time, a tent is unquestionably a very insufficient protection against such weather as this. The men of the Land Transport Corps are, from the nature of their duties, some of the chief sufferers from frostbite, their hands being much exposed to cold in harnessing, and unharnessing, and their feet to the frost and snow in their rides to and fro for stores. Sleeping in tents gives a great many men colds; these they often neglect or are unable to attend to properly, and hence spring bad catarrhs, pneumonia, and other diseases of the same class. The cold weather has not yet lasted long enough forus to judge of its effect upon the general health of the a=my, but the men are so well fed and in such fine spirits that it is to be hoped, notwithstanding canvass coverings, there wil be no serious increase of disease to record. At present the sanitary state of the army is most satisfactory. By an error of calculation, I stated in my last letter the amount of sickness as about 10 per cent. It does not exceed 6-i, or, at most, 7 per cent. There are particular corps which are less healthy; thus, for instance, in one division of the Army Works Corps there is considerable sickness; the other is healthy. The difference between this year and last is very striking. To take the Light Division, as an example; it is about 6,500 strong, and has 433 sick, no cholera, and but a small proportion of serious cases. In December, 1854, there were 258 deaths in that division; in December, 1855, there were only eight, and three of those were from wounds. Of course the absence of trench duty'goez fora good deal in thisenormous difference, but not a little of it is also to be attributed to the shelter, warm clothing, and good food the army now enjoys. JAN-. 7. A Greek has been for three days in confinement at head quarters on strong suspicion of being a spy. He was sent away from Karanyi last August, and warned not to come back. He lately returned to the Crimea with a French passport, but instead of remaining in the Frenchlines went to Karanyi. He is to receive 25 lashes, and be sent home to his own country, with due notice that if he shows himself here again he will be hung. There has been considerable excitement during the past week among the masters and officerm of transports in Balaklava harbour on account of the Eecond officer of the Star of the South, a large steam transport of 1,800 tons, having been flogged by the Provost-MarshaL It appears that he was taken to the guardhouse on Sunday night last by a policeman, who ebat-ged him with being drunk. He had resisted capture, and his clothes were torn and soiled in the struggle. The next morning Captain Frayne, of the Star of the South, and Captain Champion, of Her MIajesty's steam transport Melbourne, went to the guardhouse to intercede for him, and to request he might have a hearing, as he denied having been drunk, aud said he could produce witnesses to prove his sobriety when taken up. Their efforts, however, were in vain, and hereceived 18 lashes; and one of the two transport captains having been overheard bya soldier to remark to his companion that this was brutal treatment, he was threatened with the like if he did not go on board his ship. A complaint was made to Admiral Fremantle, and some correspondence has taken place on the subject between the naval and miltary authorities and Captains Champion and Frayne, who, as highly respectable men, holding very responsible situations, and well known to and esteemed by many officers out here, natirally feel aggrieved by the menace of a disgraceful punishment. The second mate's friends deny that he was drunk. It appears that he stutters, which may have contributedto a mistake as to his state. However, whether drunk or sober, his case is a hard one, for, besides the lashes, he loses his situation, which he at once gave up, feeling himself disgraced and that lhe could not in future expect respect from the crew. The office of Provost-MIarshal in Balaklava is an arduous one, and the officer who now fulfils its duties does so, T have been assured, in an efficient and satisfactory manner. Without severe measures it would be impossible to maintain order among the motley floating population of Balaklava. In the above case; if the mate was drank, the Piov3stIMarshal did nt exceed his duty, although perhaps a preiinry investigtion migt have been allowed when asked for bythe prisoner's owncaptain, who wasreadyto speak to his subordinate's good conduct during many months that he had been under his command. I believe the correspondence I have referred to is not yet brought to a close, but I think it unlikely, from obvious reasons, that it will lead to anything. The Wffair is to be regretted, especially if it should result (asit is to-be hoped it wil not) in a bad feeling on the part of the transport service towards the offlcers of the arny. There arefewniEtarymeninthcCrimea but have beenfrequentlyon board transports, and indebted for many little acts of attention ma idndness to their captains and officers. The Star of the South and the Melbourne have been long out here; and long commanded by their present captains. Mr. Doyne, chief superintendent of the Armv Works Corpe, goes to Engiand this 'week, to urge upon the Government the necessity of a different organizatioh of that useful establishment. Ii isconsidered-desirable, I undertAnd, both byGieierai Codrington and 3r. Doyne that, before aiotheir campaign opens, a greater- control shoucld be- established over the corps than is aforded by the agree.- ments the officers and men have signed, and which do not bring them under the action of military law. There is consequently no sufficient check on them in- cae of insubordination, and the want of power of restraining and punishing them might prove not only inconvenient but perilous, should they be called upon to march with the army in the JA. 8. To-day we havo a gale from the south. The snow is rapidly melting away from the plateau, and the ground is in the transition state from the dry and crisp to the deep and muddy. To-day it is simply sloppy; to-morrow-unless another shift of wind brings back the frost-it will doubtless be in that agreeably tenacious state so often described, but the abominations of which mock the most vivid description. The bal de l'Qpira, once so celebrated, finds rivals in the Crimea. Lithographed tickets surmounted by a group of officers and ladies in brilliant costumes and graceful attitudes, were yesterday current in the camp, price 10f. each, for a bat pare et coStura to be held at the French vilage of Little Eamiesch, on the Woronzoff-road. Notwithstanding the dark night and the deep snow, and the various drains, pitfalls, and other perils scattered about the camp, the attendance both of French and English officers was very numerous. Unforitnately, the fair sex formed but a small proportion of the throng. Up to a late hour there were but two ladies present. Between vivendi*res and shopkeepers, I believe that the figure of eight was at last attained, but there the influx of beauty stopped. Nevertheless, the fun was kept up till an advanced hour this morning. There was great cordiality between the French and English officers; three cheers were given for the Emperor, and as many for the Empress, and responded to by three for the Queen. The national airs of France and England were played and sung, and the consumption of an effervescing liquid, dig. nified by the name of "champagne," was considerable. The band of the 35th FrenchRegiment was in attendance, and the music excellent. I have received letters from Kertch up to the 4th inst. Nothing note-worthy had occurred since the cavalry skirmish in which Captain Sherwood lost his life. The severe frost which set in on the night of the 17th of December lasted up to the 3d inst., when there was a slight thaw. The Contingent and other troops were well supplied with warm clothing, and set the cold at defiance. The Turks were contented, well-behaved, and in excellent health. I lately saw, by the by, in a London newspaper some very gross misstatements respecting the Contingent, which my information, derived from various sources, enables me to contradict. The troops were said to be still under canvass when the snow set in. The truth is, that they were hutted almost immediately on arrival, and long before the snow commenced. Rape, robbery, and plunder were said to be the order of the day, and what remains of Kertch was represented to be in rapid process of destruction at the hands of General Vivian's soldiery. These assertions are completely false. One of that General's first acts on arrival was to put a stop to spoliation. The account of Major Guernsey's affair is also incorrect. The facts of that unpleasant business were as follows :-Major Guernsey was Provost-Marshal; he saw three men coming out of a house with empty bottles, and, without inquiry, attempted to take them prisoners. Two escaped; the third he captured, and flogged him without further investigation. Flogging him at all was contrary to the express agreement with the Turkish Government, by which it is stipulated that the Turks shall be punished by their own laws and customs (much more severe, by the way, than those of the British service.) The Turk shouted, " Help to a Mussalman l" The cry was promptly responded to, and Major Guernsey 'would have been, probably, murdered had not assistance come. It was for his conduct in this affair that he was sent home. Captain Hall, of the navy, is also dragged in for censure, and accused of riding Government horses. The horses Captain Hal rides are his own. General Vivianns staff is said to be inefficient, and to have been selected merely because the officers composing it belonged to the Madras Presidency-General Vivian's old presidency. On the General's personal staff there is no Madras officer. On the Head-quarter's staff there are four Madras officers, three Queen's officers, one Bengal officer, and the highest posts are filled by the Queen's officers--General MIichel, C.B., who is Chief of the Staff; ColonelGraham, Mtilitary Secretary; and Colonel Morris, C.B., Deputy-Quartermaster-GeneraL I have not time, nor would it be worth while, to dissect minutely and disprove the misstatements and distortions of truth of which the letter in question is composed. They are so numerous and systematic as to give the letter, which is entirely unworthy of consideration, the appearance of having been wuitten by some disappointed or dismissed officer.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TES. Sir,-We have all read in the papers lately how a court' martial has been held on a second imaster of pur fleet in the Black Sea for cowardice before the enemy; how he was by the court-martial sentenced to death; and how that punishment has been mercifully commuted into transportation for ife... lZot many months ago, we all read how a young man of high rank, bearing a commission in a Highland regiment, had objected to take his tour of duty under fire in the trenches; how he was not brought to a court-martial, but vas allowed quietly to sell ouLt. Whether he had been guilty of cowaidice or not is still a moot point, on which I should be-very sorry to pass an opinion; but he certainly had leen guilty of conduct which was considered to render him nmworthy of bearing the Queen!s commission any longer. I am of opinion that in such Tare cases it is far better merely to turn the delinquents adrift, without any other punishment save that social damnation which their guilt entails upon them; but I thinkl it is but right to bring these two cases into contrast, -when we find the oommon fellow visited by the Admiralty with the punishment awarded to many convicted murderers for precisely the same kind of crime which the Horse Guards overlooks in the Earl's son, on the not unwelcome condition that he shall cease to be a soldier. Surely some of our legislators will step forward when Parliament meets, and plead more forcibly than I can do for this poor second master. Pray, Sir, in-the name of fair play and humanity look to this. - I am, Sir, your obedient servant, IL..IJUSTICE TO ALL CLASSES.

- . STATE OF- TURKEY. (PROX OUR OWN COLUMSrONDMM I : CO)OTANTINOPLE, JAN; lO. The storm which threatened Omar Pasha seems to be blowing over. Up to last week, wherever one went nothing was to be heard but wailing over the fall of Kars, and a burst of indignation at the supineness, want of srlll, and even sincerity of the Generalissimo. However freespoken the Turkish people in general may be, their officials cannot be accused of want of discretion. The suddenrise and fall of political influences teach them caution, and, whatever may be their private opinion, they never, express it, unless they are sure not to be compromised by it. This general expres. sion of discontent was, therefore, an infalible barometer, indicating that a storm was brewing against the Sirdar Ekrem in the highest quarter, and that his disgrace was more or less afait accompli. The sending of aIlim Pasha, known not to be too partal to him, to Baeoum to make an inquiry into the state of things there, the councils of war, which showed their disapproval of the plan of Omiar Pasha's operations by adopting a new one, and the committee of inquiry formed for the affiairs of Anatolia in general,-all these circumstances told the same tale. Besides all these, signs of Omar Pasha's approaching, or rather decided disgrace, were evident already at a time when we were still uncertain whether he would not reach Kutais, and thus secure a base of operations towards the interior of the Transcaucasian provmces for next year. Since last week a change has come over this dark cloud which threatened to obscure the Sirdar Ekrem's political fortunes in Turkey. The faces of the Turkish officials have assumed again their stereotyped placid expression, and they have found that Omar Pasha was not so much to blame, after all; the committee of inquiry, which was no secret before, was denied,-at least every one pleaded ignorance of it; all the confidelntial insinuations about the Generalissimo's recall suddenly ceased, and the whole intention of laying open the secrets of the fall of Kars seemed entirely forgotten. Yet all this change was made with such a bad grace that there could be no doubt of its having been the consequence of pressure from without, and not th" of a conviction acquired by a better knowledge of facts. As the change took place just after the arrival of the two British commissioners, civil and military, who had accompanied Omar Pasha's aimy into Mingrelia, it was natural to suppose that this arival wam connected with it, especiay as it was well-known that Colonel Simmonds, the military commissioner, having taken a prominent part inthe direction of the military operations, was inclined to represent them under the most favourable light. But, in order not to jump to an unwarranted conclusionrabout the nature of the influence exerted, I must say a few words upon the foreign influence in Turkey, which is so often misrepresented in Europe. Since first the intricate question of Turkish politics attracted the attention of Europe we have heard of nothing else but English, French, or Russian influence. Such a Turkish official was the humble servant of such a foreign Minister; such another wished to uphold himself by the influence of such an Ambassador; such another was sold to such a Court, and political combinations and speculations were based on these premises, which turned out true or false as the case might be. All this time it was assumed that political influence in Turkey was nothing else but a stake played for by the Aiubassadors of the great Powers, who were thus represented as the promoters of every step taken in the maze of Turkish politics. The fact of the matter was, that we looked through our own medium, and entirely ignored the quiet, but powerful action, of native influences, beeause we could not see them so plainly. And yet it is -these- influences which must account for most of the fanciful eddies in the turinid stream of Turkish politics.' Foreign influence certainly does exert itself, and, owing to the peculiar position of Turkey since the beginning of the war, it has in some cases, for instance in the question of the occupation of the Principalities by Austria, imposed itself in spite of the opposition of all native influences; but, as a general rule, even at the present moment, it does not exist independently, but only as far as it allies itself with one or the other of the indigenous powers which strive for supremacy in the Turkish Government. These native influences are three-the court, the civil, and the military government. I don't count what is usually spoken of as the old Turkish party. Such a party, exerting political influence, does not exist. It is one of the many bagbears on whose shoulders, of unknown breadth, it is often convenient to heap a goodly lot of peccadilloes and disappointments. With the exception of a very few white or green turbaned old gentlemen, from whom it would be rather too much to expect a change of views which they have entertained for more than half a century, everybody sees and feels that changes are required, and must be made, or else the whole structure will fall to pieces. But a difference exists between the discretion of these reformers as it is understood in Europe and in Turkey. Europe wants to make a fac-sirnileof itself in the East, whereas here there is a desire to modify Western ideas. according to the Eastern character and the existing differences. In one word, Europe wants to proceed in the reforms theoretically,-the Turks historically. This difference of opinion is the origin of what is caUled the old Tnrkish party, but it is wrong to callita party, because it comprises the whole nation, without, perhaps, any exception. Thereremain, therefore, onlythreeinfluenceswhich exert- themselves actively in the course of Turkish politics. They are the influences which make themselves felt in every State, as they are inherent in the nature of every Government. Naturally in a despotic State like Turkey the Court influence, if exercised cleverly, will always more or less carry the day., The strict line of demarcation which has been drawn since the reforms of Sultan Mahmoud between civil and military power in Turkey has, on the other hand, favoured the development of a contrast between - the two. It is in this contrast that what' may be called politicall Efe in Turkey comes into play. Each of the two parties, civil and military, tries to win the ear of the Sovereign through 'the' influence; of the third party, and the seeonda,influeice of the foreign Powers. A look-at, the leaders' of the two rival influences will show the truth of this statement plainer than any'thing else,-Eedsahid and .Aii YPasba are on one siae; Chonsw, Rim, .and3I ehemed Alf Pasha on .the other; When the -ideas of the -former were upported by the RVestern Powers the latter sought help in Russiau influence;and before the war the position ` V55 clearly' enough defined,-the civil government of lTurkey -represented by Redschid *Pasha, , -alliedl.'with. the ' Westerte Powers, and the 1itary gove,r,ent .r.epresented by Riza Pasha, sUpported by',Russia. -Since.the be ng of the Wr the, withdrawal of-Russianinfluence and the mpometrtary sacrifice of individual interests to the dignity of the empir- thiew the parties into confusion, out of which-they are. now beginning to emerge.

The question waswho should bear the blame-OmarPasha, -or the Government, fornot having supplied him-'with-the means to insure suecess. -- f the former was decided, the Government would have its own man at the head of the best pait of the army; if the second; there was a chance of getting, the Seraskierate. out of the hands of Mebhed Ruschdi Pasha and giving it to llehmed Ali or one of his allies. -Untilnow neitherone northeotherpartyhas gainea its objecti thoroughly; Omar Pasha remains and Mehmed Ruschdi Pasha remains. The inquiry is huashed-Eismet, tho allies, the weather, and who knows *ho else, are responsible for tho fall of Kars, but it is very likely some of the smaller culpable3 will be seized upon and suffer for all. Europe will not be much wiser, and thingawillgo on pretty much in tho same way as before. And yet Europe has the right to know who are the guilty. The question concerns not only Kars and its heroic defenders,-if is one concerning the whole management of the Eastern war. What is the use of gaining victories on one side if we are exposed on the other by a mismanagement which is hushed up like a famrily concern ? It is at the same time nothing but fair to the individuals who were implcated in this t6nsaction that such questions should be asked as " Who prevented the Turkish Contingent from being sent to Asia?" "Whose fault was it that Kars was unprovided, or that the diversion in Mingrelia had so little success?" The re-assembling of Parliunent will, it must be hoped, bring forward explanations on this dark subject. In the meantime it will perhaps be of interest to your readers if the subject be a little sifted from the sources which are accessible to a correspondent. First of all as regards the Turkish Contingent,a subject which yoiu took up in one of your leaders lately. The facts, as far as I could ascertain them, are as follows General Williams's letters about the wretched state in which Kars and in general the defences on the Anatolian frontiers were found left no doubt that the invested town could not hold out or repulse single-handed the Russian army. Lord Stratford proposed, therefore, to GeneralVivianthat he should go there with the Contingent. The General wiUingly acceded to the proposition, anxious, as he was, to show by a success that the task which he had undertaken-the formation of the Turkish Contingent-was feasible; but before he could make any arrangements it was necessary to have some knowledge of the ground on which he was to operate; he sent, therefore, General Smith, late of the Bashi-Bazouks, to look at it. The report of this latter was that with the force which the Contingent then numbered,-namely, 8,000 men or so, -no successful diversion for the relief of Kars could be made. General Vivian therefore applied to Lord Stratford to have the number of the Contingent raised to 10,000 men, and said that then he was ready to undertake the task. The Turkish Government, to whom the proposition was submitted, made some difficulties about the completion of the Contingent, but expressed its readiness to place other troops under the command of General Vivian, or any other General, so as to make up the number to 35,000 or 40,000 men. This proposition was likewise accepted by Lord Stratford and General Vivian; the proposal was sent home, and repeatedly urged, but the answer of the English Government arived, which was to stop all proceedings in the matter. Through what influence this answer was returned we don't know here, but that it was the English Government from whom the refusal proceeded I believe to be a fact. Another question which has been mooted in consequence of the fall of Kars and the ill-success of Omar Pasha's expedition in Mingrelia is the working of the Loan Commission. If Omar's army was ill-provided, why did the commission not overlook formalities and supply the sinews of war ? The commission arrived here in the beginning of September, but the money did not arrive until about a month later. Nevertheless, the commission set at once to work to establish, in concert with the Ambassadors of Frauce and England, the basis of their control; it was impossible to give money for the expenditure of which they were responsible without some preliminary arrangements about the nature of the control they were called upon to exercise. Besides, the Turkish Government made no application to them for money until much later, -at any rate, too late for the relief of Kars. In order to establish the nature of their control, a project was given in by the two commissioners, with the approval of the two Embassies. This project elicited a counter-project from the Turkish Government; this latter again a counter-project from the commission. All this would have been done, however, in a few days had it not been for the Turkish official slowness, which put off the thing from day to day, and thus several weeks were lost. The propositions of the commission were-first, that a kind of statement of the finances should be given in order to know what the resources of the country were able to bear without foreign aid; secondly, that a kind of voucher should be given to show that the money had been really paid; and, thirdly, that all the principal contracts should be brought to the knowledge of the commission before they were concluded. The stumblingblocks were the two last conditions. To the first of these it was- objected that it was not the asage in Turkisll affairs to have any vouchers, whichit is notdifficultto believe. The point, however, has been more or less settled by the declaration that'the commission would be satisfied with any vouchers which the Turkish Government could give. The last point is at this moment unsettled, and yet it is, of no small importance, as you will best see by an rexample. There is an unwieldy threedeckerinthearsenalcalled the Mahmondie, which the Ministry of Marine, in its budget, whichit submittedto the commission, proposes to have converted into a screw liner, at I don't know how many thousand purses of expense, to be paid out of the loan. Now, besides that we know by experience the converting even of very good sailing men-of-war into screw steamers is a very hazardous experiment, it is not so much screw line-of-battle ships as transport power wvhich is required from the Turkish navy at the present moment, when the greater part of the Russian Black Sea fleet lies at the bottom of the harbouir of Sebastopol. This will show how necessary'tis to put acheck on-the fancies of a Turlish Mnister who is ment u6pon sining mn his depart- ment. It is especially the 3inistry of Marine which. seems to indnlge'in'th n:and it is very lkely due to; !this 'circumskmice ', 1hai the -Govermnent of Cistantiz'ople -has- 'aetennimid to keep' the ac-' counts- of: each; Miistry separte, whereas until nowr it ras" the Ministry: of 'inance :which was chaiged with all of them. In spite of these difflculties, whi ch are still pending, the conmission- has taien upon itself, without any materl ' guaan in its - hands, to pay the Turkish Ioveriient iearly 'a milion of 'money, 361 'tiat, with the- 600,000. which tho Rothachilds advan6ed, they have got ,500,0001. -It would be thus scarcely fur to charge -the Loan- Commnisson .withu'nwlliTnigesF to iimterpitliberalytheiinsttuea' 'tions 'but, at the same -time, they are responsible forth&expenditure of- the'money, and cannot run bindlyj into it.- - - Onthe other hand, we;ust not-e to hardupon -the Tiifks. It ls their first step im fiuancial trans'iectionsbf :i Euiropean character. They are asked to * give a statement of their expenditure since the be ginng of the wrar t hrzy give it.

From n the wording one -wold- conclude that This genera!: statement comprises the expenditure of an the de- partients. But this isniottihocase, as I knoir, sinco - I have seen the enclosure. -It confines itaelfto:t'oeme- penditure of the War, 'Navy, and Ordnnce IDe- -. partments. It is impossible to judge what the internal resources of Tlkey are able to bear '- until we know what the other departments absorb, and whether part of'tlis expenditur6 cainot be applied to the' purposea of war, or* othier internal - resources created; but for the moment all awe must expect is that the proce of the loan should be -, applied exclusively to the purposes of war. Letters from Trebizonde speak of the continued arfival of Turkishtroops, especiallyEgyptias, from i Eupatoria. They are destined for Erzeroum, but : the communication isjustnowimpassablefortroops, and they willprobably have to remain hiTrebizonde until the weather changes a little. The accounts - from the interior speak of caravans dispersed by snotstorms and of wanderers lost in the drifts. Mr. turray is said to have' pass-ed the Persian frontier on his way- to ossouL. All attempts at mediation made by M. Bour&e, the French Ambaasador, failed. The Persians are anxious to bring their ea-usa from their own point of view before tho ' British Government. Having no Ambassador in - London, they submitted their whole correspondence to Lord Stratford, to have it sent home to his Go - vernment. They are said, at the same time, to -have asked for the mediation of the Turkish Government; but this is an on dit which cannot be impliitly believed. That they ame anxous to have the difficulty arranged as soon as possible can, however, scarcely be doubted. One of the most curious features in this affair is that the Persians look upon it as a personal quarrel with Mr. Murray, which does not affect their relations with the British Government. The Gazdte of Teheran has a paragraph in this respect, in which it distinctly states that this lamentable quarrel will not at all affect the strict neutrality which the Persian Government has hitherto observed on the Eastern question.
PEERAGES FOR LFE. TO TME EDITOR OF TIE T S. Sir,-Alost of your readers have, no doubt, observed in the Gazette the announcement that the Queen has been pleased to raise the Right Hon. Sir James Parke to the dignity of a baron of the united kingdom, for the term of his natural life, by the style of Baron Wensleydale. The unusual wording of thispatent, though it haa as yet attracted but little attention, betokens an important novelty in the exercise of the Queen's preroI gative. It is, in fact, the creation of a peerage for ife, vthut as hitherto, a remainder to the heirs maleof ebodr. The dignityfwill therefore become extfinct on the death of Lord Wensleydale, in the event even of his leaving male issue. There can be no doubt that in thus limiting the dignity Her Mlajesty has only exercised her prerogative according to precedent, though we have to lookbaack many centuries for sucha-precedent. Lord Coke says that the Kin may create a man or woman noble for life, but not for years, because it might go to executers or administrators; and he gives as an instance thlat Richard IL created Robert de 'Vere MIarquis of Dablin for Efe. Again, Henry IV. created Thomas Beaufort, Earl of Dorset, Duke of Exeter without any limitation, from which Dugdale concludes that he was only tenant for life of that dignity. Henry VI. created Sir John Cornw.all, wvho wvas marred to one of the Plantagenets, Baron Fannop for life; and in Later times James L. created Lady larvret Compton, vwho was mother of Buckingham, Countess of 33uckingham for her life. In more recent times there are several instances of dignities granted to a person for life with a remainder over; the latest, I believe, is that of the Marquis of Londouderry, who wascreated Earl Vane for life, -with remainder to the issue of his second wife. Of the law on the subject, therefore, there can be no doubt. To a man of Lord 'Wensleydale's age, and without a son to inherit the title, it can signify little w hether the peerage be granted to him in the usual manner ornot,forthe probabilitieswouldbestrongly in favour of itS being extinct in any case; but, viewed as a precedent, this creation may assumr. a far more mportant aspect, and I therefore presume that it is not without mature deliberation that Her Majesty's Ministers have recommended to her this exercise of her prerogative. In the event of the precedent being followed up it is worth while to consider what will be its effect on the augnst body which it relates to. The hereditary transmission of dignities has hitherto been considered one of the dearest privileges of the House of Peers, and 'will, doubtless, not be discontinued in future creations without a remonstrance from that body. It is at once coeval with and the excuse for primogeniture and all those family arrangements by which the wealth of the family is centered in the eldest son. Indeed, property is an essential qualhfication to an hereditary Upper House, and so much so that no one can doubt that the flouse of Lords would cease to exist if its members were to lose their reputation for wealth, and the influence whichthey derive from it. In feudal times this was a matter of more importance even than now, and dignities were not merely personal distinctions, but annexed to lands, so that in parting with the lands the feudal baron parted with the dignities that appertained to them. Thus we read of a certinn Brian Baron FitzCount, in the year 1141, whose two sons being lepers, and he and his wife betaking themselves to a religious course of life, the king seized on his barony, and thereby extinguished the dignity; and, again, an unfortunate Duke of Bedford was deprived of his title in Henry VIL's time on account of his poverty. But, as these modes of extingnlishiingpeerageshave faDieninto abeyance, there arises this difficulty-thiat, in creating a peer, the country must either give an apanage suitable to the title, as it has in many cases done, or else its choice must be limited either to men of forttue large enough to endow a peerage for their successor, or to men who are not likely, from the circumstances of their age, to leaveanheirto the title. Henceforward there need be no such difficulty, and the only danger I can foreseetotheHouse of Peers is that the peers for life-of wvhom, necessarily, a largrer number may be appointed-will be considered the more honourable and influentiali part of the House by all who do not think that qualities of mind are heredlitary as well as rank and wealth. It may perhaps result that it will be necessary for the House to invent some mode of weeding itself of some of its more useless members-its imnb.cilles and mw7vais suFjefs-by treating them, it maybe, in the same way that the Irish and Scotch peers were treated at the union of those kingdoms. On the whole, I can imagine no measure which is mote likely to raise the influence of the Upper E:ouse.in the questions of the day, or to restore the eqa3?iibririinu which a fn r extension of the suffrage in the 'elections for thte Lower Iolse is liely to disturir.

WOOLVICH JMILITARY ACADEMY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TMS. Sir,-In reference to Mycom aunication of the 10h inst., which you did me the favour to publish in 1e Ti'nes of the 12th inst., and in corroboration of my statement as to the moral condition of this institution, I send herewith an abstract of irregularities conmmtted the six months preceding Lieutenant-ColoneliWilmot's promotion andofthe six 3nonths foUowing thIt event, in what may'be considered the order of their moral delinquency:- Nature of Offence. sPreix,m.

S . . 54 Unasteadiness at drill .3......... . . ... 4 45 44 Thesc offences have been carefully taken by me from the defaulters' book kept by the two officers commannding the Cadet Company; from Febrary, 1854, to July, 1854, and from August, 1854, to December, 1854; out of 200 cadets, of the ages from 14 to 17, many of the offences having been conlmitted more than once by the same person. The following statistical details are of importance to the poent at ise-the moral state of the Royal Mitary Academy:- In September, 1855, we had the sons of 9 noblemen and taronets, 30 clergymen, 94 private gentlemen, 4 medical men, 8 officers of the navy, 3 East India Company's service, 10 artilery, 10 engineers, 25 line, 2 civil service, 5 unknown; total 200. Of these 34 were Scotch, 35 Irish, 108 English, 4 Welsh, 1 foreign, 15 unknown; total 200. The contributions for the maintenance of the establish. xaent were,- 19 at Â£125 I. ,, so 2 ,, 70 19 ,, 60 20 ,, 40 8 ,, 20 Sent direct to practical cla ... 31 ,, 12 Tota ... ... 200 A d the cost of the establishment, includinginstruction, clothing, feeding, and pay of the authorities, comes to 1001. for each cadet within a small fraction. In this mixture of rank, country, and payments, no distinction is made, known, or felt; the orphan is as well treated and respected by the cadets and authorities as the gentlema of the highest rank in private life. And many of the candidates come here not very highly gifted in moral and intellectual endowments. It is impossible to say how many may have been deteired from sending their children to the academy ty misrepresentation and gossip, but this I kiiow fromn authority, that there were upwards of 400 candidates on the Master General's list, besides a long one for Carshalton when the Ordnance was transferred to the War Department, 92 of .whom, above the age of 14, Lord Panmure sent here for examination in November last, and he allowed all that were found qualified, including eight from Carshelton (39), to enter the academy. It is understood that at Midsumner the vtimmim age will be 16, and the academy open to public competition, and at some future period the institution will be wholly for what is termed instruction in the practical duties of both corps. In my former conunmication to you I forwarded an abstract of the course of our studies, prescribed by the regulations of the Master-General, which I had hoped you would publishf in order that the public might judge of how little is taught but what is special and professional. And it will be found, I think, after the chauge is effected, that the public schools and colleges are unable to send candidates sufficiently welltau-ghtinthetheory of artillery and fortification, in the languages and the several branches of draving necessary for ourprofessional duties, besides the time necessary for inculcating discipline, and a course of military exercises of equal, if not more value than a course of severe studies. These facts are better understood and valued by old and experienced officers. The following removals from the Royal Miitary Academy have taken place the last two years, in 1854 and 1855:- Promotions in the Royal Artillery ... ... 1 Promotions in the Royal Engincers ... Promotions in the Line ... ... 4 Remored, having failed in their examination 6 Removed from misconduct ...12 Withdrawn ... . . Died ... ...1 Total in two years ... ... 205 Hence it is that this rapid promotion rendered it necesay to inxvite candidates to thepractical clawsrithout passing through the theoretical branch of the academy, but which was only intended as an expedient, to cease when the two corps are filled up. WBth many apologies for trespassing upon your aluable eolacIns, I am, Sir, your obedient and obliged servant. G. G5. I.gWIS, Major-Genera1. Licut.-Governor.

COURT OF QVEENS BENCIL WX zst r21. JAN. 2 HAWKES V. T,MELL. Vttctngs va Ban7zco, beforc Lord CA3n'rB . and Jwtidis; COLERIDGF, Wari&. and CrOmPnON.) 'this was an action brought by the administratrix of a master of a merchant vessel against the owners, to recover the amount of wages due to her deceased husband. It appeared at the trial, which took place at -Durham, that the ship had sailed from Alicante, and while on its voyage it went down at sea. The defendants, under thesecircumstances, contended that no wages had been earned by the miaster, likening his case to that of an ordinary seaman, 'whose wages, according to the common law, did not accrue unless the freight was eaimed. The plaintiff, however, obtained a verdict, but subsequently a rule was granted, which raiscd the question whether the common law role applied to the case of a master as wel as to an ordinary seaman. Mfr. Atherton, Q.C., and Mr. Digby Seymour showed cauase against the rule, which was supported by Mr. Temple, Q.C., and Mr. tinthanlc. Lord CAdPBELL said the question is whether the rule in question applies to the master of a ship. The master of this ship had been employed by the dekendants at a -salary of lOl. a-month, and he had been four months in their service at the time when the ship sailed from Alicante, after which it went down at sea, and was lost. The question is whether his representatives are debarred from making that claim because no freight was earned in consequence of the loss of the ship. It has been urged that there is no express authority to exclude the master from the maxim, or to distinguish him from an ordinary seaman. But the reason for that mayhave been that it was understood that the rule in question did not apply to the master of a ship, and the claim of the master was never resisted, so that there was neverany occasion to bring an action. In the books it is taken for granted that the rule does not apply to a master- and there is also the express decision of "1 Chnmbre, J." tiat it does not. The 7th and 8th Victoria and the 1Ftth and 18th Victoria, c. 104, show that in the opinion of the legislature the rule does not apply to a master. The 7th and 8th Victoria, which restrcts the common law rule in favour of seamen, points out no mode by which the master can be relieved; and the 183d and other sections of the 17th and 18th Victoria,4c. 104, make it quitclear that the Legislature gave no remedy to the master, which it would have done if at had been considered that he was within the rule. The seamen are engaged for the voyage, and the earning of freight was by the common law a contingency on which their wageswesre made to depend. But the wages and fm)etions of the master are different. The master is not engaged for the voyage. Before the voyage commences he has to engage the seamen, and when the vessel has arrived at its destination, and the cargo has been delivered, he is still the master of the ship. Hec is,or ought to be,actuated by higher motives, and it is not to be supposed that he-vwill reLssxin the performance of his duties, or that hc will be urged to perform it by the apprehension that he will lose his recompense if the voyage is not succesafoLh IMr. Justice COoaxswxr said that in considering the question the Court ought to look at the situation of the parties. In the case of ordinary seamen it was necessary, as it were, to put on the screw by subjecting them to the loss of their wages if they were not both honest and zealous. But the same reasons would not apply in the case of a master, who was in a different sitnation of life, and would be likely to have more respect for his character. It had been decided that a mariner couId not insurehis wages, but that runl did not apply in the case of a master. Mr. Justice WIGHsTnAs expressed himself to the same effect. Rule discharged. BUsm-SS OF TIWE COURT. Lord CA3PBELL said it would be convenient if he gave notice that on Wednesday next, after taking the two cases which stood in the Crown paper, the Court would proceed vith the cases in the specdlpaper. BTA COURT. (Sittings at Nisi Prius, before Mr. Justia Ens. an9 a Co-mon Jur-y.) It being known that WilliamPalmer, who is charged with the Rugeley murders, would be examined as a witness to-day, every avenue to the court was crowded long before it sat; but, a large police force being in attendance, the doors were kept closed until nearly 11 o'clock, and then a limited number of persons were admitted; so that the court was not inconveniently crowded. At 11 o'clock Mr. Justice Erle toolk his seat, and then the case was ca1led on:- PADWICK V. SAR PALM Mr. Edwin James and Mr. Macnamara were counsel for the plaintiff; and Mr. Serjeant Wilkins and Mr. Gray for the defendant. This was an action brought by Henry Padwick against Sarah Palmer, as the acceptor of a bil of exchange drawn by William Palmer upon and accepted by Sarah Palmer for 2,0001., dated the 3d-of July, 1854, payable three months after date, and endorsed by William Palmer to the plainn tiff. The defendant pleaded that she did not accept the bilL The witnesses were ordered out of court. William Palmer was understood to be in an adjoining room. Mr. Js, in addressing the jury for the plaintiff, said they would have learnt from his friend the nature of this action, and it devolved upon him to state to them very briefly the facts. The plaintiffs case would be extremely simple. Mr. Padwick wtas a gentleman of considerable property, and of the highest respectability; and William Palmer was introduced to Mr. Padwick in 1854 for the purpose of having an advance of money upon a- billof exchange. The action was brought against the defendant Sarah Palmer, the mother of - William Palmer, upon a bill which was dated Rugeley, July 3, 1854, for 2,000?., at three months after date, for value received of William Palmer, payable at the Lothburybank, and was endorsed byWiliamPalmer to the plaintiff. It would be idle to endeavour to conceal from them that this case was- brought before them under somewhat peculiar dircumstances,-and Mlr. Padwick desired that the matter,so far as he was concer-ned, should be most strictly investigated. William Palmer, of whom he would not say a word, was the owner of a considerable number of race horses, and he got into pecuniary embarrassments. Mfr.- Padwick advanced him 2,000Z. upon this bill, and William Palmexhadpaid - a sum of 1,0001. in reduction of, it, and had given two checks in paymint of the residue, which were dishonoured.- Mr. Padwick was-therefore a creditor ior I, 0001. for -which he liad a warrant of attorney, under. which heissued execution,'and William Palmer ras arrested on the 12th of December. During the time he was so in custody those investigations. had, talken place which had necessarily attracted the attention not onily of this countr,Mbut of the nole world, butof which at thetimer Pad_ wick had not the slightest notion;, but it so happened that, being in custody under 3fr PAd*ick'e writ of execution,,he was taken from the custody of--the sheriff and removed into crnmnal2cuatody. : ' - i ---- - fr. Serjeant W-irs sain bethought, in-caidour t6lfs friend, it W.s right to-state thit at present Wwas iot hi1 intention tfo call William.Palmer. * I. -; Mr, JTAXYe8 said- his friend hiaing madLtha oemanie -- So== tion would conduct his cSd vrith his usual ability. 3fr. Padwick was, extremely Ammious that when, on the oso hand, it should not be tliought he was pursuing a mln under such cirnmnatances, rumours having reached him thikt th billws a forgery, e -thought it. -right to-adbpt thoe honourable courseXof lettinga jurxy test whether Willin Palmer had forged the name of his mother or not. This, he trusted, would: be thought the most straightforward course, and he therefore brought the action Against the mnother. Iet the miatter be fully investigated by a jury, and if ho had been defrauded by wiliam Palmer he must' put up with the consquences of the fraud; the jury woiLld therefore have to find whether the acceptance was a forgeMr. Before Mr. Padwick advanced the money he thought it right to make some inquiry as to the handwriting of Mrs Palmer, and he wrote to Mr. Crabb, a soicitor, and clerk to the magistrates at Rugeley, and that gentleman certified that he knew Mrs. Palmer tobe aladygworthabout 50,000., and he believed the acceptanee to be in her handwriting. and upon that Mx. Padwick advanced themoney. That part of the case would be proved by lr. Crabb, a gentle. man of great respecability. Should the jury assume it was not her writing, there would be evidence to show that Mrs. Palmer had paid other bills which-had been accepted in the saine hand, and had therefore given her saunction to hills being so accepted, and that would be the plaintiff's case. This cause had been postponed upon the application of Mrs. Palmer, in order that her son William Palmer might be pro.. drced here as a witness. He-knew his friend's discretion; he had brought the son here, but what motive might induce the defendant to shrink from putting him into the witness. box he did not know. If the result of the trial should be that Mr. Padwick had been defrauded- by William Paimer, he must Put up with the loss; but if such should be the defence, he fearedWilliam Palmer wouldaddto his catalogue of crime. The followingevidence was then caLed for the plaintiff:' Frederick Crabb.-I am an attorAey at Rugeley, aA& am clerk to the magistrates. I know the defendant, Mrs. Palmer, and have done so 12 or 13 yearsm She is a lady of property residing at B.ugeley. I am acquainted with her handwriting. I believe this acceptance to be in her hand. writing. About the timeof the date of that bill vwrote'aletter to Mlr. Padwick. By M1r. Sezjeant WILE32m-I cannot recoLect that I ever saw her vrite. I cannot charge my memory. -Upon my solemn oath, I cannot answer the question. Ihave seen her name attached to leeds; it is impossible to say to how ma-y. I should think two, but I cannot say. I don't re. collect ever corresponding with her. I have seen what I supposed to be her writing on biLls of exchange not long ago. I should think within the last month. I have heard they are disputed. Re.exarnined.-I have no interest in this matter. The deeds were from persons who borrowed money of her. I have been solicitor to William Palmer. Irecollect one deed, and might have seen more. George Palmer is brother of William Palmer, and money was paid by my client in respect to that deed, which was handed over to me. It was a mortgage deed, which would not have been handea over to me, I apprehend, by Mr. George Palmer acting for his mother. The signature was acted upon in that manner That is the only instance I recollect particularly. By Mr. Serijeant Wnrrs.-The bills I mentioned are in thae hands of a relative of maine, who would be very glad to obtain his soney. I have not had any hint that if I have mnade misrepresentations an action will be brought against me. L. Palmer's name was attached to the deed. By the JRJDGE.-The deed was handed over, and the money paid. It was a deed to her. The JuaDoL-Then, her name was of no importance. 1 don't know why her name should appear to the deed. Witness-It is generally the practice, where powers of sale are, that both parties sign the deed. John Sergeant.-I knewWiLiam Palmer. I havehad money transactions with him, and introduced this matter to Pad- i wick. I am the holder of a bill drawn by W. Palmer upon his motherforl,0001. inI852. Itwaspaid to me through the bank. It was returned to Wiliam Palmer. It was paid by a cheek from Mrs Palmer. ByMr. Serjeant WrxNS.-The check wasrforwarded to me by WilliamPalmer. By Mr. JA3rs.-George Palmer, I think, had the settling of the matter, and he caUed upon me. I paid the check to my bankers'. The plaintiff had advanced the money as my solicitor, and the check was drawn payable to him. A discussion here took place as to the validity of a notice to produce aU checks. - H. R. Hopkinson.-I served the notice to produce oxl the plaintiffs agents at 20 minutes past 2 o'clock on Saturday last. Cross-examined.-I delivered it to a clerk at the office. Mr. Serjeant WILSs.-We have not had time to produce this check, if such exists-it was not reasonable notice. The JUDGE said he would admnit the evidence, with leave to move. Mr. SergeantVs evidence continued.-The plaintiff was an attorney. The check was signed "Sarah Palmer." The plaintiff handed it to me. I saw Ceorge Palmer on tho subject of the advance of that money for which the bill was given. That check paid the bilL The bil had not beenpaid when due. I saw the -handwriting to the check, and I should think this acceptance is in the same writing. Mr. Serjeaut WIaXns submitted that that was not evidence, as there was nothing to show that the check was in her writing. Re-examined.-It is Like the signature. This closed the plaintiffs case. By the JUDGE.-I never communicated with M Palmer on the subject of that check; it was apon the Rugeley bank. The JUDGE thought the evidence admissible, as the check produced the money, and that was a means for his knowledge of the handwriting. Witness.-I believe the handwriting to be the same. Cross-examined.-I believe it from the sidmlarity of the writing. Ar. Serjeant Wnacis then addressed the jury for the defendant. But for thewicked, unconstitutional, and cruel attempts which hadbeen made for weeks past by those who ought to be the protectors and guardians of our liberties and rights-but for the moat infamous calumnies heaped upon thehead of a manwhose name appeared in this transaction, this case would not have occupied more than ten minutes; for when they heard what the case on the part of the defendant was, unless they had allowed their minds to be prejudiced-unless they had taken for granted that the infamous statements which had-been circulated were trueif their minds were free from prejudice, and they were prepared to act towards a man as they would wish men to do to them, a clearer case for a defendant was never presented to a jury. There was one observation with which his friend had concluded his statement, which he might venture to sayhad inadvertentlyescapedhislips-he saidinadvertently, because his friend was not the man to stab a falling man, and when his friend had said that if the defence -set up was trae William Palmer would add to the catalogue of his crimes, he thonght it was an observation which his friend wouId not repeat, and one which as a man, alawyer, and a gentleman he could not justify. It seemed to him that his friend wished to place before them as dispassionately and calmly as. he could the facts of this case. He should call Mrs. Palmer herself and several members of her family, and one and all would tell them that it was not the defendant's writing. He should call bankers' clerks well acquainted with her writing, and he would also call' an expert in handwriting, and he would tell them his opinion. If it was not her handwritingthe otherpart of the plaiitiff's case must fail, for Mrs. Palmer could write very well, and there was no reason why she should delegate to another the placing her signature to a bilLl No doubt, it was an attempt to imitate her writing, but they would be completely satisfieditwasnothers. At presenthewouldsaynomore, asthe qaestion was merely one of handlwriting. . He was so pressed with the difficulties 'which had been thrown in the way of al1 the members of this family that he entered upon the case with more anxiety than in cases of larger amount, and involving circumstances of greater interest. John Smnith.-I am.an attorney at Birmingham. I am wel acquainted with. Mrs. Pamer's writng. I have seen her write 12 or 13 times. I do not believe this acceptance to be the writing of Sarah Palmer. Qross-examined,-I am not the defendant's attorney. I am assisting him. I amn aware William Palmer is brought up here. I am defending the proceedings for him. He is I rought up here, but I do not mknow by whom. I have -heard frommy other half'attorney that the defendamt has brought William Palmer up.

Wiliam Palmer then retired, very strongly guarded. Mr. JAMES then said,-I trust your liordship will think I am doing my duty as counselto Mr. Padwick, and that he has been doing his duty very honourably and properly, by saying he reires from this case. Itrust your Lordship will think Mr. Padwick has acted most properly in having this matter investigated. Mr. Serjeant W-RMs said,-I must say that I, for may own part, am bound to admit that MIr. Padwick has acted -with the greatest propriety, and no one can censure him for bringing this action; and I feel it so strongly that I feit no difficulty in urging on my client-and the moment I suggested it it was acceded to-that the defendant shoud not ask for any costs; and we are obliged to Mr. Padhvick for his honourable conduct, and no costs will be asked from him.

(Sittings in Mriddlese,. atAsi I Prim, in Hilary Term, before .Mr. Baron B.AMwILL and Comnwn Jr0ies.) The second sittings at Nisi Prius in Eilary Term, were commenced this morning in the Exchequer Chamber. The list of cases presented 34 causes for trial, of which 17 were remanets. A.IJSAR AND ANOTHM V. BDARlEIElD. Mr. Gates conducted the case for the plaintiff, and Mr. Carr appeared for the defendant, This-was an action for money lent, for money paid, and for money due on an account stated. The defendant pleaded never indebted. I It appeared that the plaintiffs are distillers in ledcross-street, Barbican, and were in the habit of supplying a publichouse known as the Prince of Wales, in the Wandsworth-road, with gin and other British spirits. In June last a transfer was made of the house to the defendant, when, as the incoming tenant. he reqeestedar. Marshall, the coHlector of the plaintiffs, to make a valuation of the stock of spirits which were oil the premises. This was done, and the valuation of British and foreign spirits came to 691. 10s. Of that sum 31. odd was for British spirits. The defendant, foliowcia" the usual course of the trade, thereupon requested Mr. Xrshall to' give him a check for that amount, so that he might pay the. outgoing tenant, and he afterwxards made a smular demand on thecollector of the frm who supplied the foreignaspirits. In both instances, as it was the usage of the trade, these demands were at once compiied with, Mr. Marshall, the representative of the plaitiffsi, giving a check, upon his fini for 3&. That sum was in due course debited-to the defendant's account, to be paid off by instalments or otherwLse at some future time. 'Te plaintiffs, however, not being able to procure the repayment of that sum, nor for gaods subsequently supplied, were compelled at length to bring the nresent action. - - . of The defence was that the letter accompanying the copy of the writ in the action was addressed to Mr. "J." Bareficld,. whilethedefendant'snamevwas "Wiliam" : . I The defendant, on now being examined, said that his name wvas "IWilliam," thathis father's name was "John " and therefore that when the -note and the copy of the-writ weregiven to him by Marhall's sersantlhehadhandedthent' to his father; who had at once consulted the attorney wiho' defended the action.

That was very true, and hewas prepared to tepay the money- and also to pay for the goods he had hbamot: only of Mr. Marshall, but of -all -the others, and-of that fact he had sent them notice o.i Thursday last.' Mr. Baron- BRAxwLi -here inquired 'of the leanized counsel for the defendant if -he had I any other gr6und of defence thain this as to the Christian name.

Great activity continues to prevail in the whole of the departments there. The building of the paper factory is progressing rapidly, and it has received a portion of the machinery. The non-commissioned officers and men of the 57th Regimaent subscribed their working-pay from October, 1854, to Tebruary, 1853, to create a fund for the benefit of the -ridows and orphans of soldiers of the regiment -who died in the Crimea.

TEE MEDICAL DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY. - TO TERE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In ffLe Timnes of the 26th of December there appeared a letter on our military system from the pen of a writer who, J imagine, on a formar occasion, long before the war l,roke out, performed signal service by directing the atten-. tion of Parliament and the public, in a series of letters in your journal, to some of the numerous incongruities of the then existing order of things. That letter sketched in ouitline the condition and prospects of our army at the opening of the campaign of 1854, and broadly exposed the defects of the Ordnance, Commissariat, and M,edical Departments. The advantages of the writer and the trnthfulness of the picture render it matter of regret that his promise to return to the subject has so long been delayed. Time presses, the meeting of Parliament ih at hand, and we hope, for the information of the House, the improvement of our military system, and the good of the public, that he will speedily carry out his intention. What may be the measures in 7etto to satisfy the Sebastopol Committee and meet the demands of Administrative Reformers it would be hard to tell. Meanwhile, it appears to be generally known on fhat maybe regarded as good a thority,-theauthority of one of the parties themselves, who, to spare further punishment and conciliate public opinion, has for weeks been eagerly spreading the good news, .-thatthe medical officers of the armyare immnediately to be favoured with a large measure of reform. So large is it said to be that we almost fear the news is too good to be true. All rank-s of the department are to participate. The full and half pay are to be increased, the period of service entitling retirement is to be shortened, honorary rewards are to be introduced, and the Garetee will shortly exhibit a sprinlding of C.B.'s and K.C.B.'s. That, in principle, must satisf the ambition of every aspiring medico. Towhom are the medical officers of the ary indebted for this great boon of reform in their department ? To the public press, to your own unfinching, powerful advocacy .of their claims, to one or two abl1e pusulphiets recently issued on the subject, and to the temperate petitions of the medical officers themselves now serving' in the Crimea. Dr. Andrew Smith lias had no more to do with it than the lawyer who draws up your will has with the disposal of your property. DIriven by the force of circumstances, and encouraged-nay, invited-by Lord Panmure, he has lent his assistance, and no doubt his Lordship has found hini useful to the same extent as a dictionary would have been on a late occasion to Admiral Napier ; bhit that he ever originated the new warrant, or was even anxious for it, his whole official life as Directol-General positively denies. And assuredly neither the departnent nor the public, however anxiously he may hope for it, will give himtheleast credit, or be hoodwinked bythelonc, loolked for boon. It may accomplish this much for him, and no more-it may possibly avert 31lr. Stafford's motion of inquiry into the state of the Medical Department. MÂ§r. Roebuck and the other mnembers of the Sebastopol Committee, will yet have their say, and it may be asked how is it that Dr. Smuith is still head of the M1Iedical Department, Dr. M,enzies, of Scutari notoriety, the principal medical officer at Shorncliffe, and Dr. Dumbrecks, of Ealaklava incomnpetence, one of the new medical board in London? Are these to be the new C.D.'s and K.C.B.'s of the department? I am, Sir, your obedient servant. F.R.C.S. Jan. 19.
STAFF-JOBBIiSG. TO THE EDIT6OFOF THE TIMS. Sir,-There is a standing rule of the service, which may be found in the Queen'sregulations, that no officer shall be taken from his regiment and appointed to the staff until he shall have served two years as a regimental officer. There is, also, another standing rule, that not nore than two captains and two subalterns per regiment shall be employed on the staf at the same time. The extra pay and extra allowances of an officer on the staff nearly double his regular regimental pay-his chance of promotion is also more than doubled, his duties are lighter, his danger and hardships less. The object of these standing rules is clear. It is, -first, to ensure a sufficient degree of capacity and military knowledge in the officers so selected; secondly, to prevent regiments being improperly weakened by the abstraetion of more than a certain number of experienced officers on staff duty; and thirdly, to reward these officers for those qualities which have occasioned them to receive the distinction of a staff appointment. A good deal wad' written last winter on the severity of the duty thrown on the subalterns of the Rifle Brigade in consequence of the absence of an undue number of the captains of that corps on staff duty, all the absentees being men of interest at the Horse Guards, who thus escaped the killing trench duties, and, nevertheless, were the first to be promoted. Since that time another battalion has been added vthe regiment; and, none of the subalterns of the corps having served thetime specified by theQueen's regulations, the number of officers a"sent on staff duty, who wrere on this account necessarily captains, until now has not much exceeded the Queen's regulation. Now, however, the staff-jobbing is about to recommence. The General Orders in to-day's paper state that Lieutenant G. H. Grey, SecondBattalion of the Rifle Prigade, is appointed to act as Aide-deCamp to Brigadier-General Laurence, C.B., commanding the second Brigade, Second Division, with the usual pay and allowances, from the .1st of January, 18a6. Lieutenant Grey has very good interest. He is the son of Sir George Grey, Secretaryof State, and the nephew of Earl Grey and of the Hon. General Grey, attached to his Royal Highness Prince Albert. He had been in the service, on the 1st of January, 1856, 12 months and 24 days, according to Hait-s Arrty List. 'Why are the written rules of the service to be set aside in this case? Your obedieiit servant, A 'I& .Y Z.K U4 U, hJ..

"1 It is not for us to develope this argument, for it would not satisfy us, and, thank Heaven, we are independent enough to say what we think. Truly, a Power like Russia snoula never lose sight of the wNshes and interests of Europe. She ought to knmow, at a pinch, how to sacrifice her welfare to the happiness of others. But there is a limnit to aU things, even to generosity, even to self-denial. Who would believe it, even if we state it, that Russia has just sacrificed her interests to those of Europe, and that she Ins shown herself more European than Russian ? No one, And we ourselves-we own it-we would not believe it. " We shall therefdre be more, sincere, and we shall be the more readily believed when we say that Russia only accepted the propositions made to her because it was her interest to do so, becausesbe ought to do so; and we wil say why. "Every impartal, loyal, and just-minded man mmust own that since the commencement of the war Russia was always desirous of peace, and that it always slipped through her fingers because she was never allowed to conclude it. - This time she found herself in miore advantageous conditions to obtain her object. After the heroic defence of Sebastopol the efforts of her adversaries to seize upon the Crimea failed before the immense obstacles opposed to them by the Russdans, and in Asia, where she took the offensive, she achieved a great success by the capture of Kars. "In this position, and still in her full vigomr, Russia could await, yet desire peace. She herself made the first propositions, and when those of the allies reached her through the medium of -Austria she did not hesitate to accept them, for, with a trifling differcnc.z they were nearly the same which had received her assent at the Vienna conferences. One point only presented itself for the first time, and seemed to have been purposely inserted to prevent once more the work of peace. " Already, on her first refusal, wlhich, however, was not a categorical refusal, Austria evinced an inclination to break off her relations with Russia and to increase the complications of the war, while at London rmen exulted at beholding Russia once more fall into the snare. She might, in fact, have fiond the whole of Europe arrayed against her, which the force of circumstances and a complication of insidious engagements would have reduced, even against its will, to that hard extremity. It was here that the real enemies of Russia laid wait for her; it is for this result that England laboured. Russia has upset their calculations, and she has done welL "But we maintain that it was her duty to do soon another ground, which refers to the future-a word which a great Power must never lose sight of in its most grave resolutions. What is, in fact, the real cause of the war? What is the motive of this general, universal mistrst into which the very friends of Russia have been driven?I The cause is that which all the most solemnn declarations of Russia have not been able to annul, and which -would always have existed as long as no positive and, so to say, material proof had been brought forward to contradict it; it is the idea that the dreams of the ambition of Russia was the conquest of Constantinople. Howsever absurd, ridiculous, contrary to the most patent facts was such ia misconception, nevertheless it was so widely spread,-it had struck such deep root in puablic opinion,-that it woald always have been an immense and most disadvantageous obstacle to Russia. Her adversaries therefore put a syllogism to her, which, although coming from an enemy, had, nevertheless, a certain value. " 'If you are sincere,tchey said, 'in your protestations not to wish to seize upon Turkey, why not at one blowv demolish that terrible supposition, which, rightfaUly or wrongfully will always be suspended over your head, by ceding tothie Porte a stualltract of land wlnchl brings you in nothing, and which is of no possible use toyou except for the invasion of the Ottoman empire? Time day upon which yOu make that material concession all Europe will believe that you do not followv the dreams of aggrandisement attributed to you; it will do more,-it wllU OWlt that it was ia error. "Russia has just given this material proof of good faith to Europe, and in giving it she exclaims, 'Do you believe me now? - "Russia has therefore destroyed at one blowv the innmenso distrust which exists on all sides against her, and the snare about to be again laid for her too great suscetibility by the hatred of those who regard the present warless as a political than as a national one."

I TO THE EDITOE OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In page 24 of the paper of observations published by the Conmittee of Investination of the Eastern Counties Raiv;y,Ifindyslfdeeried ude th hadof"Hackney to the contractors for those branches, and asbaving, in that capacity, suggested the use of a portion of the Eastern Counties' line to those contrac. tors for a rem of 2501. I never was engineer to any contractors on this or any occasion. I was engineer to the Eastern Counties Railway, and, as such, I always advised the board of directors for their interests. In the instance referred to they acted on my advice, and the result was that they saved betweei 3,0001 and 4,001. Had they not acted as I advised them, they must have ineurred the above expense in the purchase of land to apppo pate as soil for the execution of these branches, on wlich therewas no excavation whatever. The imputation that these branches wereimproperlypermitted to be converted into a receptacle for the contractors' diggings1 is therefore wholly erroneons. I regret that the committee did not apply to mO for infoer mation on this subject, but bave made this inaccuiato representation without evidence from any party concerne4. As extensive circulation has been given to ihe statement throughout the country, I ask the favour of beingpernltted to contradict it in your columns. - _ I have the honour to be your obedient servant.

.TO THE EDITOR OF THE-TiS. : - ebtedto you for having )atherto exercised A wvns and statemak forbeatanc, 1y witbholding from publication any document whitn, in your opinion might revivethe m.emory of reuvances now happily forgotten, or iU any way exacerbate the im feeling which is already but too prevalent against England in the united States. But, as you have now published the President's Mressage, in which, tnder the title of " Recruitment," he has deliberately promulgated to man'kind in every region of the globe alleged maisconduct on the part of Great Blitain, " infringing the municipal law, -derogatory to the sovereignty of the United States, and requiring not only a cessation of the wrong, but its repara-tion," I- trust you will see no objection to my submitting, through your colunms- to the judgment of td advocates of poeace, to the preat and good men of all nations a few facts, which I resuscitate, not for the purpose of proving that in the act complained of we have committed no wrong, nor for the mean object of recrimination, but to convince the enlightened classes of the United States that; as our Christian brethren, it is their bounden duty to terminate the trifling question in dispute by magnanimously forgiving us our trcspasses, as we forgave them when, as I will briefly show, they trespassed against Ur. President Pierce in his able Message rsts, or rather constructs his complaint against Great Britain, on the folowing basis - "Itis," he declares, "The traditional and settled policy of the 'United States to maintain imparEial neutrality during the wars which from time to time occur among the great Powers of the world. Performing all the duties of neutrality towards the respective- belligerent States, we may reasonably exopect them not to interfere with our lawful enjoyment of its benefits. "Our municipal law, in accordance with the law of nations, peremptorily forbids not only foreigners, but our own citizens, to fit outwithin thelimits of the UnitedStates a vessel to commit hostilities agaiust any State with which the United States are at ace. " While the laws of the Union are thus peremptory in their prohibition of the equipment or armament of bheigerent cruisers in our ports, they provide not less absolutely that no person shall, within the territory or jurisdiction of the United States, enlist, or enter himself, or hire or retain another peron to enlist or enter hiself, or to go beyond the Imits of jurisdiction of the Uinited States vwith intent to be enlisted in the service of any foreign State, either as a soldier or n marine, or seaman on board of any vessel of war, letter of marque, or privateer." Tow, with a desire to convince the people of the United Statesthattheyhave notealways fulfilled this doctrine, I beg leave simply to recall to their recollection the following historical facts, which took place when their present Minister of War, Mr. Marcy, was Governor of the very State (New York) in which these facts occurred. 1. Previous to 1837, in a time of profound peace between Great Britain and the United States, the Government of the latter country, vho, like everybody else, dearly foresaw that, sooner or later, there would be an outbreak in Canada, deposited on that frontier a quantity of 'United States' artillery and of new muskets, for which they had no ostensible use, and which, to say the least, they took no precautions to guard. 2. In the year 1837, after the three dayse insignificant but long expected rebellion in Upper Canada had, without the aid of troops, -been effectualDy suppressed, two American citizens, self-styled, in large printed placards,-" General Van Ransalaer, commanding 1st Division of the Patriot Army," and " Major-General T. S. Sutherland, commanding SecondDivision of thePatriobarmy,'"-whicharmy, bypublic advertisements and at public meetings had beenopenlylevied in the United States-took possession of these unguarded cannon and muskets, the property of the Government of the United States. 3. Major-General Sutherland, sailing with a part of his "Division" on board anAmericanvessel, directed a heavyfire of the cannon he had thus seized upon the inhabitants {women and children) of Her Majesty's town of Sandwich, under the pretence, explained in his placarded "-Proclamation" of liberating them, instead of which the people of Sandwich made him anad thelwhole of his sympathizing force prisoners. 4. The remainder of Major-General Sutherland's Division landing on another part of Canada, after killing and -wounding 30 of Her MajesWs soldiers, under the command of Colonel the Hon. S. Maitland, maltreated and robbed the British inhabitants of Point Pel6 Island of horses, hogs, sheep, cattle, and poultry, valued at above 1,0001. sterling, the whole of which they carried off to the United States, 5. Another porlion of this "Patriot Army"took forcible possession of, and then burnt a large British steamer, named the Sir Robert PeeL 6. In the harbour of Buffalo, in the United State;s in broad daylight, in the presence of the United States' Marshal and of other high authorities of the Federal Government, of the Government of the State of New York, and of a militia regiment quartered in the immediate neighbour hood, 1,000 men were set to work by the American General Van Ransalaer to saw the Caroline steamer out of the ice, in which she was -firmly imbedded. Seventeen American citizens openly and publicly signed a bond to indemnify tbe proprietors in case of her loss. The American collector of customs gave her a lieense, under the authority of which, and amid acclamations of triumph, she sailed for Navy Island, Her Maje,stys territory, where, acting as a passage boat, she assisted in conveying American-born citizens and 22 pieces of artillery, belonging to the United States' Government, which for a fortnight were fired from Her Majesty's territory upon her unoffending subjects in Canada ! - When the Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, and M1r. Fox, Her Majesty's Minister at Washington, called upon Governor larcy in particular, and the several American authorities in general, in deference to the laws of nation;, to recover from General Van Ransalaer the United States' artilUerywhich was wagingwar against Great Britain, Colonel Sir Allan M.NTab received in replyan official letter, laid before Congress, from the American Commissary-General Arcularius, reporting and confessing, as Governor Marey had previously reported and confessed, his utter inability to do so. Nowv, for all these violations of those laws of neutrality, the strict maintenance of which President Pierce, in framing this complaint, has just declared to be " the traditional and settled policy of the United States," no offence was taken by the British Government, no " apology" was required. England has had dark pages in her domestic historycruelties aud folies not a few to answer for; but in al her annals, from the beginning of what may deserve tobe called her intercourse with foreign nations, fronm the day she had a foreign policy and a national character to support, she never tamely submitted to so much insult-was never so degraded and disgraced as she was in 1837 and 1838 by the outrages which she suffered to be committed against her subjects in Canada, not only without chastisement, but without anything like a spirited remonstrance, But, after having exercised this extraordinary forbearance, after having practically Ehown to the citizens of the United States that England preferred patiently to endure almost any insult rather than commit the sin of embarldng in a fratricidal war with them, would it, I sabmit, be creditable to them, at a moment when England's right hand is engagedinfighting the world's battle of "liberty against despotism," to add to her difficulties and to increase her sorrows by insisting on talingoffence at the British Minister at Washington having made arrangements for enEsting, not in the United States, but in the territory of Her Majesty's Colonies, whoever might voluntarily repair there with a desire to join the British army nobly fighting in the Crimea for the freedom of mankind 9 The American people, before they resolve to ca3 England to account for an alleged "v iolation of the laws of neutrality," so minute that the solar miscroscope of their sharpesti-sighted lawyer can but barely perceive it, ought surely, pa- conird, to remember the good temper with which the Old Country has submitted to a repudiation by the State of Florida of about $2,000,000, by the State of Arkansas of al their debts, by the State of Mississippi of $5,000,000 of their debt. They should also remember the unpaid debts to this country of the States of Alabama, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and MaryIand. Hoping that the good sense which characterizes the people of the United States will induce them to feel, from the foregoing facts, that it is their duty and our duty, their interest and our interest, to forgive whatever injuries we may intentionally or unintentionaUy commit against each other. I am. Sir. vour obedient servant.> F. B. READ. Oxendon, Notthampton, Jan. 17.

It is not because there is one tremendous character that calls out all, the energies of an actor, and forms one of the Bst of those ordeal-parts thhat have to bez passed through by every aspirant afrer supreme histrioniC onours. Indeed, the personages are rather of that comfortable class into which actors who have already made a reputation by more arduous efforts in other plays love to drop andenjoyasortof jocular repose. Tragedians,.esp. cially, like to vary their career by an occasional representation of fr. Oakley), as if it were pleasant now and then totake breath, aftar de icting those emotions that renid the heart, by mimicking thoese minor sufferings that merely set it in a twitter. lr. Reanfs.representation of the meek sufferer is exceedingly conmie. Placid, resighed, good-humoured, he seems to reg,ard the groundless jealousy of his " betterhaif"{how absurd, bvthe vay, must that expression have sotmded In the ears ofMr. Oaldey)-as somethingigiposed by destiny, to which he must passively submit, even as an orthodox Mussulman to the bowstring. Innocenceis written in every Ine of his face; he knows he has done nothing to merit the terrible tongue-castigations which he is perpe;tally receiving- but he quallyknovws that his innocence is of no avail, that 'whatever :he does will be misconstrued, that even i^ heb amused himself with studying.Pararc& laura wouldbecome an object of suspicion. And against this guileless being what a fearful personage-is Lfrs. OaQlley, as delineated by 3Irs. KeanI What dexterity does she mse'to throw off his guard an adversary who is never on his guard at all; with what exuberance of acuteness does she crossquestion hina and torture his poor, harmless sentences into involuntary confessions of guilt; with what a wild outburst, of triumph does she catch him tr iping! We feel that the real dupe of the play is Major Oakley (acted in excellent old-fashioned style by Mr. John Cooper), who fancies, good, easy man, that because he has persuaded his brother to sing "tol de rol" in his wife's preseicC he has subdlued that turbulent nature for e-er. -We I;ovW better, in spite of the green curtain that brings the sNory ton elose.' We know that that slight skircishe bougte no permanent victory to poor ~d.Oaliey, how-~ver flushed he might feel in the little lOnent of his litte victory, andr thatrifrthe chroniclesof the Oaley family were brought dowis to a later date we shorJdfid in the vesy next chapter that the resituhous husband became as thoroughly hen pecked as ever. But we are forgetting our question as to the cause of popu larity in the Jealous WZfc. Partly, then, it is popatar on account of its abn dant actioi and two or three hi-.hly effcdtive situations, partly because 5 conjugal CamPas's, without any reallypainful caseur beilli, is represented with great fulness of detail, and the Ladies and genltlemen can vie with cash other in laughing nt or idrkthe victorious party, just as the WVhigs and Tories comnpete d in applauding Addlison.'s Cato. One can alwvays magine that s;ome few amonig the audience compare their own condition with that of the fond couple on the stage, and are conspicuous in their mnirth to show that they do not mind it much: Nor should we forget the especial good wrhich has been done to the Jentor u TVfe by its abridgment into three acts, and the consequnt annihilation of one Captain O'Catter, long ingloriouslycelebratedas the worst Hibernian on the stage. The play being essentially one of action, the incident- gaim by being brought close together.
JENNYY LIND AT EXBTEPR HALL. The concerts of Madame Goldsclnidt at Exeter Rall seem to be as much in vogae as at the outset. The fifth took place last night, when the hal was inconveniently erowded. The oratorio was Mendelssohn's Elija7, a repetition of which condrmed in every particular the impressions derived from the performance of ainonth since. Mladame Goldschmidt's singing in Elijah reachesthe acme of the sacred style. While attempting m3uch less, with P -view to absolute effect, than in the Crcation andthe -HessieT&, she does rnore to attain that complete realization of thecomposee'sintentions whichshouldeverbetheaim of atrue artist. Mendelssohn, -we-are persuaded, imagined very little in the principal soprano part of his oratorio that is not fully ap. prehended by 3ladame Goldschnidt; and he probably did! not dream of anything like the ransceendent fervour of her "Holy, holy "-which heard once, it may be safely said, can never pass away from the memory. It was for Madame Goldschmidt, indeed, to discover the lofty expression of which this brief "Sanctus" was capable. As a musical setting of the words, simple, impressive, and true, it has always been extolled by musicians and connoisseurs;* but M!adame Goldschmnidt felt its sublimity; and froms among a clnster of beantiful things in the second part, wvhich, admirable in their place, are stil not to be ranked with the capital points of Elijah, she may be said to have pointed out "Holy,' Holy P" as an inspiration .worthy of being placed as high as anything else (even " Thanks be to (God") in the extrdordinarywork to 'wisch it belongs. This'vas the instinct of genius. Theperformance last night was generallybetter than on the previous occasion. The choruses for the most pad; ,went with remarkable vigour and precision under the direction of Mr. Benedict ; and the other " principals"-lsfise3 Dolby, B. Willians, and idessent, Iessrs. Lockey, Lawler, and Weiss-sang their best. The unaccompaned trio, "Lift thine eyes to the mountains, whence cometh help" (Madame Goldschmidt, Misses Messent and Dolby), and the contralto air, " O rest in the Lord" (Miss Dolby), were both given to perfection, and both unanimously encored. The audience were not less discriminating tlhn liberal of applause, and testiAied the usual enthusiasm in favour oi 3dame. Goldschmidt.
HoRUIBLE MunDnm Ez LivERPooL.-LirvYrooz, Jan. 21-At an early hour this morning a vagabondnamed Ferguson, aged about 25, weUl knomn to the police by the fash name of "Fake," went into apublichouse, and boastea that he " had just done the business for his wench," a girl named Dranmond, with wbhom he formerly cohabited. Information was given to the police, -who, after taking him into custody, subsequently found the body of the youngT woman in Wolfe-street, Toxteth-par,, -with her thIroat cut; in a shocking manner, the head being almost severed frona the body. ft has since trapired that the prisoner was con. nected with a desperate gang of burglars in the towvn, composed principaly of ticket-of-leave men. While living with the deceased, he had -frequently charged her with giving information to the police, and had sworn that he wonld cut, her throat. Last week three of this gang were apprekended, charged with burglary, and were conumttecl fcr trial at the assizes. Last night the prisoner and the deceased, together with some reckless companionz, were drinking all night at a low publichouse, Which they left together at an early honr this morning, and nothing more was heard or seen of him until he returned to the house with the statement which led to the finding of the deceased's body. When apprehended, he said lie didnt care for the consequences, as he had said he would db it. An inquest will be held on the body of the deceased befora the borough coroner in the morning. Ferguson has been known to thepolice for about ten years, prowling about tho docks as a tlIef and vagabond, and has frequently been in Re occasionally worked as a striker in a smithy. the deceased had been living with another mn, %fl'w PVIUmC A0roi-nEN-xs.-A retumn to an order of the Rouse of Coammons was on Saturday published of all nevw laces created and appointments made since the 9th of APrl, 1848, with the salaries of each, "c It appears that in England 2,775 appointments have been so created, with salaries amou4ting to 427,480? ; in Scotland 11, with salaries of 5,845?.; and in IreLand 1G7, with salaries of 3;,430L-makia" an aggregate total for the united kin3gdom of 487,40sf1.
