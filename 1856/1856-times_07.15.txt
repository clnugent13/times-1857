RAILWAY ZXZTELLIGa-MP. A - t I LONrDONL.RR7lTF:Tn%l m=tn* The directors of this company have decided upon recomr mending the Paymeut of a dividend for the half-year ending the 30th of June last of 2!. 10s. per cent. on the consol2ated stock of the company. MAINCsESTrR, SBEFIELD, AND IJNCOINSERE. The half-yearly report of the directors of this company hasi ust been issued It states that accounts of the eWpditure connected with the company's railways and with the South Junction Railway have been publed as usual each fortnight in T7eC Tmes during the half-year. The acrounts of the past half-yearshow a total revenue of 267,0941 earned in connexion withthe railways and canals, * a total expenditure of 131,5371.. and a balance of net profit on the hull-year's workingof 135,557; *or, with the balance of 7,638!. brought forwrard from the ppsvious half-year, a total suns of 143,1931. available for interest and dividend. The debenture and other interest- charges against the halfyear amount to 61,S9l,; the canal annuities to 13,7341. ; the dividend on the 61. preference shares to 23,6661.; the dividend on the 10! preference sbares (now " 61. percent. stock") to 26,16C7.; and the dividend oi the 34 per cent. stock to 5,9591.; making a total charge of 131,411!. against the alovo net balance of 143,1951., and leaving 11,7841. available for dividend on the ordinary stock of the company. - The directors have been able, owing to the reduced pnce of money, to renew the debentures falling due on favourable termS, and they are nowt readily obtainin,g money at the rate of 4L. per cent. per annum. The amount charged to revenue for in!terest on debentures this half-year has been augmnented by the high rates paid for money during the pressure which has now passed away, and this charge may be expected to dimnish in amount with the iroreasing confidence existing in monetary affairs. The directors recommendto theproprietorsto pay, afterproviding forthe whole ofthepreference dividends and charges, a dividead of 5s. per 1001. on the ordinary stock of the company, or at the rate of one-half percent. per annum; and to * arey forward a balance of 2,0484 The passenger traffic has exhibited an increase of 3,5521., the parcel traffic of 871., the live stock of 3051., the mineral traffic of 3,5461, and a decrease on goods traffic of 5,395!. The comPntition of direct steamers and of the Aire and Calder ompany have compelled the directors to reduce some of their through rates; but thoy trust that that reduction may be somewhat counterbalanced by an increase of traffic. 'The loal receipts of the company have heen 55,928. for the conveyance of 1,116,978 passengers of all classes, as against 53,6161. and 1,037,467 passengers for the coerespondin- half of 18S5. The receipts for forei-n passenger traffic lave been 12,6991., as against I1,4591 -m the corresponding balf of 185 ; showing a total increase on this traffic of 3,5521. The local traffic on the line amounted to 139,9591., and the foreign to 75,5091. The directors report a steady increase in the traffic and net profit of the Manchester, South Junction, and Altrincbam Railway. The Anglo-French Steam-Shipping Company have already three steamers running between Grimsby and the ports of France, and theremainingportion of their fleet may be expected to be similarly occupied in the course of the year. In order to develops the resources cf GCimsby it will be necessary still further to extend - the steam communication in connexion with the gort, - which will be greatly pÃ¯Â¿Â½bmoted by the proprictors o this company assisting the directors in the provision of capital necessary for these undertakings. Many of the directors and officers of the company have invested capital in steamers for the benefit of the port, and they expefr a more earnest co-operation on behalf of the general body of the pro: prietary than they have yet bad placed at their dispomsaL The directors remind the proprietors that the progress of Grimsby as a port for through traffic is now simply a question of adequate steam communication. The working expenses and charges show a reduction of 24,4001. as compared with the corresponding period of 1855. During the half-year the contractor for the permanent way has under his contract, fished 37 miles 68 chains of permanent way, re-laid 1 mile 13 chains, and removed stone blocks on 3 miles 71 chains. The expenses of the canals have been reduced by 665! as compared with the corresponding enrod of 1865. The capital account exhibits an inerease of 33,983. The directors congratulate the proprietors upon the fact that the time is approaching when the debentures of the company may be capitalized, and the uncertainty always attending a floatingdebt beremoved. The capitalizationof this companys debt at 4 per cent. will effect a saving of 20,0001. for interest and charges, or equal to 10s. Per cent. on the ordin,ary stock of the company. Thiey also congratulate the proprietors upon the settlement of the differences which arose betwveen the London and orth-Western, 31idland, and Great Northern Companies, asto the traffic - divided under the Gladstone Award. Mlr. Gladstone will very shortly commence his labours under the agreement which remitato him the division of the traffic in dispute. This company's relations with surrounding comnpanies continue to be of the most friendly character. The net profit of the year ending June30, 1853, was 175,0841.; that of the year just ended is 274,0301., showing an increase of 91,9461. The capital account to the 30th of June last shows that 8,752,9301. had been received, and 8,739,6261. expended, leaving a balance of 13,304. The arrears of -nterest on the No. 1 quarter shares and 101. preference shares capitalized, amount to 366,6971., andjfor which a 34 per cent. stock has been issued. The mortrgz and temuorary loan accounts show that 2,620,4461. h been borfowed, of which 1,550,0881. was at 5 pe cent., 30,8651. at 4j per cent., 584,1151. at 4. per cent., 209,0651. at 44 per cent., 1M4,062!. at 4 per cent., and 62,2501. at 3c per cent. The revenue account for the half-year ending the 30th of - June last shows that 267,0941. had been received, including 217,616!. from the railway, 5,4011. from the south junction line, 6,450!. for rents, hc., and 37,6271. from the canals. The total railway expenses ainounted to 1.2,0561., or .51-49 per cent of the receipts ; the canal expenses to 19,4811., or 5177 per cent. ; makngtoaetherl3l,537!., or 5153 percent., leavingabalanceofl135,56. Tothissum is added17,638!.froma the last account, naking agdisposable sum of 143,195a From this is deducted 61,8911. for interest on loans, 13,7341. for canal annuities- 5,959!. dividend on 34 per cent. stocl, e23,666!.for disi4eu on the 6L. preference shaares, 26,1601. for dividendoaths10!. preference shtare;, and 9,7351. for the proposed dividend on the ungutaranteed capital, leaving a balance of 2,048!. for the next account.D WORCESTER AND HEREFORD. It appears that the works on this line are to be proceeded with forthwith, and thus an important junction will be effected between the Midland and Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton, lines on the one side, and the Sxrewsbhuy and Hereford, Newport, Abergavenny, and Hereford, and South Wales district on the other. The line is now beinu staked out, and will be constructed by the company's own engineer, Mr. Liddell, and not by contract. It wiU be conetructed at first as a single line on the narrow gauge, and it is expected wil be ready for opening in about two years. RAILWAY TAFIC. Msiles aa- iSe- Total, Total.

ZABOUB at HOME and in THE UNITED STATES. TO TIEE EDITOR OF THE TMS. Sir,-In your remarks of the 11th, on the " half-holyday" maovement, I regret to see that, in alluding to the demands of labour in the Unitedl States of America, you say, "1Tae great mas of the population, however-the labouring classes -have not on the other side of tne Atlantic the same laborious existence as their fellows in England." Believe me, Sir, there is no greater mistake th-an this as hundreds of skIilled English mechanics have discovered, when too late, As one of the British Comlissioners to the New York e Exhibition in 1e I directed my attention to the question of the hours of lbours in various employments; for, eik fmany others, I had been , led to beieve that not only could the artisan earn more money, hut that he worked less time in the States than in England. To my astonishment, however, Ifound that in some employments two hours more per day wtereby no means uncommon;and in my reporth state "th pat though the rateu mg s of reurtiis relatively higher, TEOo nabrof hoursion constituting aday'work, especially an fcoYlabou r, is muhef greatera3t, pandothtthis excess in c o the hour of orkobtans enerllyin eeryindustrial occup a- tiont"nWhen to this isnaddued facth faect,that aseven th few hoyaswhiehusage stil preserves in England are unknown in th te Stats, an that one day per annum, the 4th of July, is the only appr)Toeachtd a peogle's holyday celebrated in the latter country Ithink "itwll he at ocs that in this particular the Ibouring classes of the States are not in ogoodapooltion in this respect as even our own. You wil therefore, I trust, pardon me for calling your attention to this undoubted fact, especially as such a statement as that to which I allude, as forming part of your recent article upon so interesting a subject, to the labouring classes at least, as the Saturday balf-holyday is calculated t-o keep up the erroneous opinion among our artisans that they can earn more money by shorter hours of labour in the Umited States than in England. Durixr' the last three yvears I have been repeatedly applied to by skiled artisans to&advise them as to their prospects of emplo0ymen1t, &C., in the States ; and my first object has bEen invariably to point out the difference in the hours of labour.

The Lords Commissioners were the Lord Chancellor, the Duke of Argyll, and the Earl of IHArrowby. Petitions against the Scotch Parochial Schools Bill were presented by the Dake of BucOLEETcH, Lord MELvTLE, and the Earl of uNsFnmD. The Earl of IARDWICKE presented petitions from Manchester and Salford, praying then lordaEps to take into. consideration the abrogation of certain mantime rights of the country, agrted to at the Conference at Paris. The noble earl then gave notice of his intention to withdraw -the notice he had given in reference to the construction of ships and vessels in the dockyards. He had placed that notice on the paper in order to call their lordships' attention to the state of oar naval forces as cornparedwith thatof theforces of the United States. In ioner warswith the United States disgrace had fallen upon us in consequence of our beino unprepared with the same description of force as that wiUch had been created by the inteLligence and acivity of the Americans; and he had heard that the Aimericans were even, now endeavounring to produce vessels wvhich would surpass our owvn in weight of metal and in speed. But believing that he had done saffldent in calling the attention of the A dmiralty to the subject, and hoping that there would be no necessity to fit out any armuamenits against the A mericans, he would askapermission.to withdraw7his notice. Petitionswere presented by the Earl of GALLowAY, from ax place in Scotland, against the Parochial Schools (Scotland) Bill; by Viscount DUXG.eMON, from Ashton-under-Lyne, in favour of the withdrawal of the Maynooth grant; by the Earl of ArATssBunr, from the guardians of the poor of St. Luke's, Chelsea, against the 26th clause of the Metro- Eos Iaaement A mendment Bill; and by the Duke of rsmcroso, from Inverness and BangZ against the Parochial Schools (Scotland) Bill; also petitions against the Registration of Leases (Scotland) BilL. Viscount DUNGANNON gave notice that, on Monday next, he should nut a question to the Government with regard to the aslleged dismissal of certain soldiers of the Limerick Militia and the Mayo Rifles, with scarcely any clothing on their backs and not more than 6d. in their pockets, at a considerable distance from theirhomes. The Earl of IALMESBURY gave notice that on Thursday next he should move for copies of the eorrespondence which had taken place between the British Envoy at Rio Janeiro and the Brazilian Government on the subject of the slave trade. The following hills were read a third time and passed:Badge's Estate Bill; Glastonbury and Bruton Railway B yTidal Harbour and Railway Bill; Imprisoned Debtors' Discharge Society Bill; London and North-Western Railway Bill; Dorset Central Railway Bill; and the Commidssioners of Supply (Scotland) BilL. ITALY. Lord LY%DHUERST.-I am anxious, my lords, before we separate to call your attention to the affairs of Italy. I have from time to time applied to my noble friend opposite (the Earl of Clarendon), to furniish us withinformation on that subject, but my applications have been unifonmly unsuecessfuL I regret to say that we do not very often sueceedin obtaining information from my noble friend, or in procuring papers conaining information to be laid upon the table, until sach information has ceased to be interesting or important. Happily, however, in this case other sources of information are open to us. Deplorable, indeed, my lords, is the situation of Italy. (Hear, hear.) Every man of education, every man with any feeling must deeply sympathize with the situation of that most interesting and unfortunate nation. (Hear, hear.) When my noble friend published the protocol of the 8th of April the world was taken by surprise, and Italy hoped and expected great and important advantages from that publication. I regret, however, to say that those hopes and expectations have been completely disappointed. Ihave often questioned to myself the policy of that publication, unless the Governrments of France and England intend to follow it up, no' by a mere interchange of diplomatic notes, but by some efficient action (hear), foritisimpossiblethatmenshould continue to live under a foreign military tyranny without being eager to breaktheir chains; and to raise the hopes andexpectations of persons in that situation, and afterwards to disappoint those hopes, is a course that must lead in all probability to a most calamitous state of things. I need hardly add, my lords, that of aU military tyranny the military tyranny of Austria is the most gallng and odious. It is not in Italy alone that we have had experience of the military occupation of Austria; we have had more recent evidence with respect to it in the principalities. The Austrians entered the principalities as friends and protectors -professedly as friends and protectors, in virtue of a treaty with the Sovereign of that country. It might be supposed that under such circumstances the Austrians would maintain most strict discipline, that they would abstain from all violence and injury to the inhabitauts, or that if, by any accident any injury or violence were committed, that it would be speedily redressed. Unfortunately, however, things took a different course, and I think I am authorized, from the information I have received, in saying that the people of that country lamented that Russian invasion was exchanged for Ausrian protection. The Austrian occupation of those countries has been spoken of in favourable terms, but I have seen so much of the evidence from official documents that I feel certain the statement I have made is perfectly correct. My lords, by the treaty of Vienna the line of Austrian power in Italy was strictly defined. They have passed this boundary; they have stretched themselves along the coast at Ancona, and they are now in the occupation, with an immense militay force, of the duchy of Parma and a portion of the State of Modena. They command, indeed, the whole south of Italy. I will not enter upon an inquiry how far their original entry into the Legations was legal, and how far it was justified by the condition of the country and of the Governments. ThesethingsIpass over. Theyarevwelworthyof consideration and discussion, but they would take me from my present object. What I wish is to bring before your lordships the present state of that country. From the time the Austrians have passed the boundary seven years have elapsed. For seven years they have had possession of this territory, and they have placed a greater por'tion of it in a state of siege, and under martial law during the whole of that period. My lords, when is this to cease? Whatterminationistobe pttothisstateofthings? Iask-this ofmynoble friend. ewall tell me that the short answer returned by the Austrian Government to this question is, that they will leave this territory when they can do so without danger of insurrection. A bad Government producas dissaMtisfaction, disturbance, and possible insurrection. That leads to the invasion of a military force. The possession by a military force continues and increases M1i9satisa on, protects bad government, produces diswurinc, and renders it impossrble to .emove the troops; so that to the evils of the possession of such a country by a hostile force there appears to be no reasonable termination. My lords, that is a sad prospect for Italy. If it be true, is there no remedy? What are we to say of the condition of that unfortunate country? My lords, I refer to the suggeston which I think proceeded from mynoble friend opposite. I refer also to the suggestion of the Sardinian Government as to the mode in which these evils may be terminated. The plan is this:-establish a satisfactory Government-a Government that Will satisfy the people establish a small national force for the purpose of keeping the peace, and then you may withdraw yourarmy. 'Until that is accomplished it is impossible. Now it must be allowed that this plan is specious; if it couldbecarried into effect it would be satisfactory. But, my lords, it cannot be done without the consent of Austria. Will she consentto do it? Will she consent voluntarily? If she wil not consent by her voluntary act, will she consent by the pressure or persuasion of the Westera Powe'n?- A man, my lords, must be credulous indeed to suppose that Austria will voluntarily quit the possession of these distrricts. It has been said sometimes that the inconvenience of thispossession is such thatAustria by her own act willwithdraw her troops. I know a little of Austria; and I am sure that 'the inconvenience must be of a nature much more strpDg than I can conceive to lead her to withdraw-her trooni'from this part of Italv. I think, therefore, that so far as ielates to her voluntary acts, the withdrawal is altogether hopeless. It has been thought that she may perssibly yield to the pressure of France and iEngland. I lok fcrward to that stUate of things with the anticipations of agreeable results. I do hope that the pressure will b sueh as to accomplish the object which I have inZ view. I do not mean a pressure by the force of arms, but by the usual effect which would be produced by that pressure. Bab I may be permitted to say that, although a short time ago I waS sanguraine as to the effeets of the concura' rence of France and England, yet that certain events have since occurred and certain symptoms have appeared, of such a nature and character as to lead me to entertain very serious doubts whether those hones will be realized, Not that there is any coolness betweenithe two countries or any want of energy on the part of England; but there are circumstances in the Eituation of France which lead me to doubt whether she is disposed cordiaUy to co-operate bn this subject. But, my lords, although I do not absolutely despair of the state ofItaly. Iconfess Ifeel very great anxiety, mixed with very great aistrust and fear, that the object which I have n view may nob be accomplished. My lords, my noble friend in the document to winch I have referred spoke of the grievous notoriety of the state of the kingdom of Naples. It is imposible not to say a word on that subject. I wlill only say, in ;eneral terms, that nothing, in my opinion, can exceed the Wnfamy of that Government. I will not attempt to describe the conduct and policy of that Government, because any terms that I cold make use of wouldfail tot impressyour lordshipe minds with the reality of the evils under.wbich the subjects of that Goverrnent suffer. Nothing but a minute detail of circumstances of a most extraordinary kind which have ocourred, could possibly impress your minds with a distinct and accurate notion of the state of that country. I must leave this to the general impression of what you have read and heard. Iwill only refer toa publication to which I have before alluded-a publicatioinby rht hon. friend of mine, the member for the University o ford. That publication was circulated extensively throughout the continent of Europe. It went tbou;h various editions, and caused a great impresdion. An official answer was returned toit by the Government of Naples. I .ao not know how moany of your lordships have read it; but, so far from refuting the statements of my right hon. friend, it only co med the accuracyof his details. I will take that publication. I strike out evervthing but what fell under the observation of the author-a man of trathful character and conduct-and, referring to that document alone, I say it marks the infamy of the Government of Naples. But it may possibly be said that these occurrenecs took place four or five years ago, and that great improvements have taL-en place since that period. But, so far from an chan having taken place, the same system has Oontinaeu from tat time to the present-the same infamous system of tvrsanny and oppression. If it is suggested that a change has taken place, let me refer to what ispassing at this hour in the langdom of Naples-to the political trials that are going on, the counterparts of those described by my right hon. friend (Mr. Gladstone), in which there has been a disregard of every principle of justice and a violation of every right. Persons have been suborned to be witnesses against the accused, and men have been threatendedwith imprisonment and punishment unless they consented to give false witness. Iwlall not go through the detaiLs, but your lordships must have read them, andmust have seen that a greater vioiation of right and principle never existed in the history of the world. But what makes the case worse, -if it could be made worse-that this state of things is founded upon no law, not even upon the law of arbitrary Government. The constitution of Naples was sworn to by the King. After the disturbances ho ratified the adoption of that constitution, which has never been rekoved, and is now the law of that country. The obligationof that constitution is, therefore, still in force, and everything has been done in open defiance of the law and in direct violation of the constitution. My noble friend told us, in the document to which I have referred, that although the general princiole should be that one State ought not to interfere in the interiortransactions of another, yet that there were exceptions to that rulqthat there might beexceptions which not only give the right to interfere, but make it the duty of another Government to irterfere-and my noble friend applied that princiole to the State of Naples. Three months and more have elipeed since the treaty of peace was signed, and since my noble friend 3ssented to that principle, and when lasked my noble friend, about a weekago, if the Government had received any return to tho note sent to the King of Naples, shat was the explanation? Upon a subject so grave, so inportent, so interesting to the country, so interesting to mankind, mark! my lords, what was the answer. The King of Naples had retired to Caserta, and, although the place is only a few miles distant, that Was put forward as a reason for delay. Did you ever hear, on so grave a subject, such trifling-such absolute mockery-such insult? (Hear, hear.) But I am told-and my noble fricnd will tell me if I am right-that within the last two or three days an answer has been received. [The Earl of Clarendon made a gesture of assent.] I see an assent on the part of mynoble friend, and I thank him for it, because that will lead meto anotherquestion. (Laughter.) Is that answer satisfactory? I am told that it is extremely the reverse. I amtold that it denies the right of this country to interfere in the affairs of Naples, and that it not only denies the right, but positively refuses to give any expplanation. I will repeat the question. I ask my noble friend whether that is the e o the ansver received to the impcrt2nt communication which he addressed to the KnofXalesl? Mfynoble friend showvs no sign. (A laugh.) Ten Isal s himu to lay on the table of the house a copy of the answver, that we may have an opportunity of judging whether the information I have received is correct. (H3ear.) There is no country in the world, I should say, more open to the power of England than the King of Naples. If the kingdom of Naples sats our power and authority at defiance, what is the interpretation'vwhich I put upon that conduct ? It is this:-that they feel that there is some lukewarmness, some backwardness on our part to co-operate in extreme measures for the purpose of obtainlng the object which we have in viewv; and they think further that we should not like to adopt measures which might give rise to conflict with Austria. We threaten the Governmentof Naples. We say, "Your conduct is atrocious, is infamous; we require you to change it." They refuss to change it. f we do nothino, what, becomes of the prestige of England? (Eear, 'hear.) My lords, seven years have elapsed since Austria entered into possession of ithe Legations, and established a state of sicge and martn law throughout the whole of that country. In an assembly of Englishmen it is not necessary to dilate upon what must be the state of a country occupied by a military force of foreigners establishing such a system as that. Of all inst.ruments of arbitrary powver] martial law is themuost effective and the most fataL (HIear.) Acts of oppression are exercised withoutrestraintor limit, andupon bare suspicion peaceable citizens are apprehended and thrown intoprison. AsEnglshmenwohave a'cry imperfect idea of what being thrown into prion mes. tVe have a notion of well arranged apartments, inspected end visited by magistrates and officials * but we must not transfer that notion to the loathsome dungeon in which men of education and men of station are imnrisoned withthe vilest and most atrocious malefactors. (Hiear, hear.) Such is the state to which many of the inhabitants of theLegations are now reduced-occasionally drawn forth for the purpose of undergong trial. WVhat species of trial? Trial by a military tribunal of foreigners, every member of which is subject totheconrtrol of the prosecution; a trial without any form, without any rule of law, in which everFthig is directed aecording to the will and discretion of those by w hom the proceecings are instituted. And what is the result! The result, lam told from the highest possible authority. is, that since the Austrians have been in possession of the Legations, 200 prisoners have been shot, and between 2,000 and 6,000 sent into exile. (Sensation.) I go to another spot-Farms. An immense military force now occupies that territory. Aeonfiet takes place between the invaders and the Government The Government insists that the trial of parties accused shall be before the ordinary tribunals. What say the Austrians? -that they shall be tried by a court-martial of foreigners. Every man who in that- kingdom is attached to the due administration of justice must wish to be tried by the ordinary tribunals. But this fact has occurred, and it is a melancholy fact-that before the conlifct took place the Austrians had seized a great number of persons and transferred them to the dungeons of Mantua, where they lie in a hopeless state; for if brought to trial they will be tried according to the discretion of the Austrians. (Hear, hear.) It is while this conflict is going on that it is consistent with dutiy for Her Majesty's Government to do everything to interfere and supporb the cause of the people ; yet, my lords, although this contest has been going on for a very long period, it is only within a few days that our Ambaedor has arrived at Parma. Whether we shall derive any great advantage from eis presence, I will not pretend to say; but, if report speaks truly, his inclinations and opinions are opp to the rights which it should be the duty of Her Majesty's Govcrnmentto defend. (Hear, hear.) I pass it over, and I come to another part of this subject-I allude to the kingdom of Sardinia. Every Englshman must feel the deepest possible interest in the fate and prosperity of that empire. We are related to it now bycommon institutions and by a hrotherhood in the great struggle which has recently terminated. The advocates of foreign occupation ay that Italy is not adapted to free institutions. The State of Sardinia is a striking refutation of that opinion. (Hear, hear.) Under the greatest digiculties, in a situation where the mot active struggle was going on, Sardinia has succeeded, by firmness and moderation, in establishing a free constitution; and I am sure every man in this country and every one of your lordships mnust feel anxious that nothing shall occurto impair in any way the benefits of that constitution. (Cheers.) The state of things in that part of the Peninsula is one, however, which must cause the greatest anxiety. That Government is regarded with jealousy, with aversion, I may almost ay with harhed, by the neighbouring Government of Austria. That Power regards the Sardinian Government as holding out a most dangerous example, anid anything that can be done for the purose of subverting it wil be eagerly adopted by Austrsa. M[y lords, in every constitutional Government there will he parties. In Pied mont there are the gradicals on the one ride, and the Ultramontanes on the other; but there* is in addition, a third and most dangerous party-the party of the priests-which has shown its sentiments tovad the Governument by its conduct in the affairs of the property of the church. At the same time the great body of the popultion of the country is content and happy, and areactive in their support of the constitutional Government. The danger to Piedmont from abroad is not confined to Austrian intrigues, actively carried on against her, bub is also to &e found in the immense armies which are concentrated in M neighbourhood. The least accident may create a collision which mnust bring down destruction upon the territory of Piedmont. But that is not the only danger to which the Sardinian Government is exposed by the formation of vast armies upon her frontier-armsies already large, and increasing dayyday. Their presencerequiresPiedmonttomaintain a much larger and more expensive military force than her limited meanswould otherwisejustifyherin supporting, and therefore she is complled to withdraw her financial resources from beneficial application in order to employ them in the maintenance of an army to defend her againsb the multitudinous forces of Austria. My lords, I wish to impress upon you, as I desire to impress upon the Govern- ment, the absolute necessity of giving the strongest moral support to Sardinia, and should an emnergency arise-should a necessity occur-to give further the aid of its material support (hear, hear) to a country which has deserved so well of of Europe as Piedmont has done. (Hear, hear.) Allow me to point out to your lordships the bitter feeling of Austria towards Sardmia, as exemplified in the case of the sequestrations. There never was an instance of such littleness-if the affair had been one between women, I should say, of such spite. (A laugh.) I will just briefly describe the circumstances of that case. By the law of the country every subject can cast off his allegiance-that is, with the consent of the Government, and with that consent he can leave the country and become a foreigner-in every respect a foreigner, and, like every foreigner, he is allowed to hold property in the country. Now, after some disturbances at in a greatnmnberof personswhowerenotatalconeemed in these disturbances, but who felt that a further residence in that country would be uncomfortable, availed themselves of the general license to quit the country;but, beingwarned that particular caution was reqrsite at that time, every one of them applied for and obtained - a special perminion. The greater number of thoso persons established themselves in Piedmont, where they be came naturlized, and thereby, according to 'the laws of that country, becamne entitled to all the privileges of liardinian subjects. 4ay of thbem have become membcers bf the Assembly in Turin. HIowever, in consequence of some alleged suspicions the property of these persons in Yilan was squastrated by the Austrians. No explanation wras given,-no grounds assigned,- no evidenoe was sat"d, no ju&s tification offered; kbat that sequestration ban cominned, despite the contnued and earnestremonstrancesof-Piel. mont, down to the present tine-a period of between three and four years. Having stated these facts to your lordsbips let me for a moment ask what is the course recommenade by the friends ef ItalyI They are earnest in advising that there should be no attempts att iurrection; that for the moment the idea of an united Italy should be abandoned, that a3l hopes andwishesforrevolutionarymovements should be abandoned. The plan of an unitedItaly is impracticable. Revoltitonary movement would be immediately crushed by the disciplined bands of Austria, and the pressure of lher despuiism rould be increased tenfold. Such, therefore, must be the advicegiven byal real, genuinefriends of Italy. (Hear.) I have taken some pains to inquire, and I understand that the great mss of the inteligent and well informed men throughout Italy are most moderate in their views. They eesire no great chuges, they do not wish to alter the existimg Governments, but what they desire, and what they are entitled to demand, is an impartial administration of justice and a firm honest, and inteligent administration of social aff1irs. &ive themthat, and I firmly believe the great majority of the people of Italy wil be content. When the French codce of laws was introdauced into the Legations, .and civil affairs were firmly and honestly administered, Ith people before discontented, became satisfied, happy, and .weaithy, and that period of its history is regarded in that district as the happiest it has ever known. We know well that, in Tuseany, the laws which the good Dluke Leopold introduced were productive of happiness and contentment among his people; and we also know that at the present tiie thepeople of Viedmont are contented, happy, and prosperous. That is what the people of Italy now requirethat is what wl satisfy them, and I would advise them most strongly not to seek to disturb the boundaries of d.ifferent States, but to labour with all moral force, by all the means in their power, to gain the objects theyso much desired-impartial administration of justice-good administation of civil affairs. My lords, there is one way in which that object may be attained, and with facility-it is by the cordisl union and earnest co.operation of France and England. *Whether we may hope for that co-operation for such an; object I will not undertake to predict-it may occur-it lis occurred-and it has produced great benefit to' the people of the country to whom that unitedaction was applied. Thatis theonlyhope of the Italian people, and I trust I sball have some explanaton from my noble friend which will justify them incherhg that howe. My lords, I very much regret that the Astrian Plenip6t_iary at the Congress was not content to discuss with my noble friend and the French Plenipotentiary the question of the affairs of Italy. At the same time I am not at all surprised, because with kustriathero is only one ruleof government,andthatis-force,coercion,directmitarvrepres- sion. It is a prin-iplewith Austria, thatthe people are for the Government,andnotthatGovernment is for the people. There is not one liberal idea in their whole system. Por sucha system to exist in another country, supported by foreiga bayonets, must be horrifying* and with what feeling that system is regarded by the Italians we have most abun(dant evidence to establish. My lords, I have thought it my duty to bring this most important and most interesting subject beforo you, and I trust that the very deep interest Itakein it wil he my exeusefor addressing you at such length. (Hear, hcar.) The Earl of ARTENDON.-My lords, during the course of the last two or three years it has been my disagreeable duty to meet with official reserve motions whieh have been sabmitted to your lordships by the noble aud learned lord on the foreign policy of this country. The statements of the noble and learned lord have always been so lucid, and have been aecompanied with such powerful appeals to the sym- pathy of your lordship-although my noble and learned friend declares himself to be only responsible, or rather rresponsible, for his ow-n opinion, and that he speaks for no party-that I ara sure your lordships will make allowance for the responsibility of those who speak from the Ministerial benches, especially when no demand hasbeen made for the production of papers I never at any time rose to follow my noble and learned friend without a deep sense of the delieacy and difficulty of the duty I had to perform. In saying this I do so because I feel that there is so much in what has faUen from my noble and learned friend that meets with the sympathies of the people of this country ; that there is so generous an interest prevailing in this country in favour of Italy, and so great a desire that that country should emerge from her present crippled position, and be lifted up to the station which she is entitled to hold, and which she may hold by means of judicious reforms, that I feela natural regret that I cannot meet my noble and learned friend by laying on the table of the house papers which -would show what are the opinions of the Government, and what have been the steps taken to procure a better state of things in Italy. But the correspondence on that subjeet is incomplete. It is stil going on, and we have favourable expectations of the result. I can, therefore, conceive that notbing but injury would occur to the cause my noble and learned friend has at heart by the production at this moment of that eorrespondence. It might bethe means of putting an end to the friendly and confidential communications with those Powers which are chiefly concerned in the condition and welfare of Italy. My lords, we eamnot improve Italy by force: We must come to an Munderstanding with those countries from which the movement must proceed. There are many facts to which my noble and learned friend has alluded which exhibit a state of things oÃ¯Â¿Â½ long st;aning. There are many flagrant abuses of authority to which he has referred which seem to be the necessary consequence, to a certain extent, of the caprices of men in the highest state of society, and which can only be remedied by Government and by a power which cannot be produced suddenlyand byexternalpressure. Ihave endeavoured to collect all the information I can with respect to the present state of Italy, and to separate it from all exaggeration and all party spirit; and I admit that in order to establish a realy better state of things, not only a state of things adapted to the character and wants of the people, but which must have some reference to the unfortunate eirecmstances of Italy, I am certain-and I rejoice to hear the opinion and advice given by noble and my learned friend on that subject -that revolution, however momentarily successful, will ot lay the foundation of any substantial prosperity. It is our earnest hope that the people of Italy are too sagacious and have profited too much by former experience, not to resort to means, the result of which will render their position worse. My lords, nothing has been done by Her Majesty's Government either to promote or excite revolution. I feel that it would be both unjast and cruel to excite expectations which could not be realized-or rather, I should say, expectations which we are not prepared ourselves to realize. (Hear, hear.) Because if we excite expectations on the part of a portion of Italy-if we lead them to expect aid from us, I say that we are bound to render that aid. (Hear.) And though Iam prepared to say that there are casesinwhicb intervention in the affairs of other States not only becomes a right but an obligation as strong as any treaty, still I hold, as a general rule, that interference with the internal affairs of other States is not justifiable, and can only be resorted to upon the clearest grounds and as a last resource. (Hear, hear.) It was in this spirit, it was with a desire of preventing revolution and of laying the foundation of sabstantial reforms, and of procuring the speedy evacuation of foreign troops from Italy, that the subject was brought before Congress. In fact, the first step was tak-en by France; and this I think maybe taken as a proof that the Government of France desired the withdrawal of the French troops from Rome. (Hear, bear.) I cannot but regard with satisfaction that the subject was brought forward before the Congress, notwithstanding that it has been most bitterly condemned. I was sorry to hear, even from my noble andlearned_fiend, an expression of regretthat thematter should havebeen brought before Congress unless measures of greater vigour were to be taken by the Governments of France and England. We have been told that we had no right to bring the subject forward before the Congress at all; that, by doing so, we were discussing the independence of States not represented at Congress; that it was calculated to defeat the object which we had in view, aud that the representatives of the Governments who brought the question forward are responsible for the consequences which may ensue. Bat I say we were fully entitled to bring that noaestion before the Congress; and when all the great rOwers of Europe were engaged in the great work of pacification, when they were solemnly binding themselves to evacuate the territory of Russia, when Greece, Turkey, and the Principalities were to be relieved on the earliest occasion of foreign troops, I say it was impossible not to cast our eyes towards Italy, wvhich for years had been occupied by foreign troops. I shall not enter, any more than my noble and learned friend, into the causes which led to that occupation; but we felt that it was a measure only to be justified by urgent necessity, and thit it ought to cease with the causes which gave rise to it.. We felt,.also, as my noble and learned friend has said, that that necessity would never arise nless accelerated. We felt that the initiative would not he taken by the Italian Government. It may be convenient for F overeigns porary suPPort rather than incur the anxiety and trouble of rendering themselves independent by effectixng reforms which would secure for them the gratitude and affection of the oeople. It was with this object we brought thi question before the Congress; but I have good reason to be satisfied with having doxne so. And here let me tak-e this opportunity of adverting to the conduct of Count Cavour at the Congress, who was more potioularly intdrested in the issu-e of that discussion, kIsconduct throughout was moderate and dignified, ad h. well ss tained tho reputation which he had already earned for himself by the services which be had rendered to his country. To' -him mnore than to any othiÃ¯Â¿Â½ man was Sardinia; indebted for the establishinent of liberal institutions, whereby he has rendered great service - to Itlyblprvigthat the Itla eol r not unfit to eioH.ealinstitutions, adthat rainliberty is ntinconsistent with devoted loyalty; and that both may be enjoyed in that countryw-.ithout risk of revolution, or dlanger toD public order. (Hear, hear.) It is true, as my noble and learned friend has said, that three mon'this have elapsed since this discussion took- pIlace; and it is also true that there are no visible results. But mny noble and learned friend must not infer from this that nothing bas boeen donie. As mnuch has been done as could- be undertaken in the time that has elapsed. I wish I could ffay that 'the result of our communications with the King of Naples was satisfactory. I cannot do so, for it is -nble tbatJuly-iwoGQyerments oould be more at arance in ruespect of the fatts of the case than Her MajesE's Government and the Government of the Kug of Xaple& Our repreentations were3made to him inthe mot friendlyspiri. We stated our reasons for believing that the exiiag state of things was dangerous to the stability of his throne; and also injurious to the peace ef Europe. We particularly pointed out what were the dangers which threatened His jesty, and we more especially%inted to the necessity of a better-administration of JuIc We pointed out the inexpediency, not to say the danger, of apoecy characterized by systematic mistrust and unjust perEecution, and, above all, we showed how essential it was ihat all subjects of HisMajesty, irrespective of theirpolitical opinions, should have sufficient security for their persons and their property. I think, ny lords, that a milder representation with respect to the existing state of things could hardly have been addressed to any Government. (Hear hear.) It is true that at last we received an answer to this representation, but we have not yet been able to confer with the Emperor of therenchon the subject of this answer. I hope I tallnotbrintthe French Governmetuderte censure of mynoble anldlearnedfrienidbysayingthattheEmperor is absent, and that, as yet, therefore, there can be no replv given. (" Hear," and a laugh.) Uintil we have commumf cated with the Prench Government on the subject, and have determined with theml upon the course which it may be necessay to pursue, I think it will be better not to ly tht note upon your lordships' table, and I shall conine myself to saying that it -was impossible forany newerto be less satisfactory or less indicative of future improvement. CHe, hear.) But, mylords, the questions of reform in the Fontifical States and the withdrawal of foreign troops from those States have also been pressed upon the consideration of the Powers principally interested, and, 1 must say, have been discussed in a manner and in a spirit very different from that in -which the King of Naplea has met the suggestions made to him. Although my noble and learned friend may be incredulous, I believe the Austrian Government itself desires to withdraw its troops from the Pontifical States. I believe that the French Government also wishes to withdraw its troops, and this desire, so far from meeting with any opposition on the part of the Roman Government, is shared and approved Dytit. If, then, it be true that this desire is sincere on the part of the three Powers principally concerned, I cannot believe that much time will elapse before the withdrawal I have spoken of talses place, and before those precautions are talken which will be undoubtedly necessary after so protracted a foreign occupation in o;der to prevent the recurrence of disasters -which we should all regret. (Hear, hear.) Theseprecautions being taken, however, I can see noreason-whythe Papal territory should not be evacrated with as little danger or as little mischief astook:placein Tuscany. The events of 1848 may have left painful reminiscences in Tascany, and may have raised the same apprehensions on the part of the Government there, but it is to the credit of the Grand Duke of Tuscany that he determined to rely for support upon his people alone, and to reqluest the withdrnwal of the Austrian troops and your lord pss re aware that the last Austrian soldier has long left the Tuscan territory, without the slightest disturbance having ensued. (Hear.) Mfy lords, I sc no reason why this example sheold not be followed. (Hear, hear.) But, my lords, in point of fact, the experimont of confiding in the Italian people has never yet been tried, for those excellent measures which inaugurated the reign of the present Pope, and which were received with gratitude by his people, -were, like everhing else, swept away by the torrent of revolution in 184. 1 say, then, that measures of reform have not had a fair trial. (Hear, hear.) I hold in my hands-it is too long for me to read to your lordships -the Pope's proclamation, dated in 1849, which preceded his return to Rome, and in which the foundation of a better judicial system was completely laid down. I believe, if the reforms there promised by the Pope were carried into execution, that everything which my noble and learned friend could require for the better administration of justice there would be carried ouLt. BuLt I repeat that, as yet, the exhibition of confidence in the Italian people has never been attempted. Throughout the greater part of the peninsula an administration founded upon the policy of securing the affections by promoting the welfare of the people has never been tried. The policy hitherto adoptedhas always been one of fear, founded upon the expectation of immediate revolution, without analyzing the causes of those fears orinquiringwhetherthose apprehensions were or were not justified. Now, this is not a natural state of thin's. It is not natural on the part of nations to rebel agamst their Governments. A rebellion against a Government which secures its welfare was never a national feeling on the part of any people ; and I am convinced, my lore; that the Italians are not inaccessible to cindness, that all they wish is to have their wrongs redressed, and that they are not difficult to govern if their rulers will attempt tGs work of reforming in good faith, in good earnest, and under a greater sense of responsibility than that which they have hitherto exhibited. (Hear, hear.) My lords, I don!t know that any practical utility would ensue from my attempting to follow my noble and learned friend throughout the speech he has made. He himself has pointed out in his speech some of the great difficulties which must attend the course to be. taken by this Government. He has stated in plain terms the difficulties which we should have to encounter in acting alone. Hehasstatedinplaintermswv;hyitisne-essarythat erere, ifs aplied at all, should come from France and tether; andI believethat until -we can supply that strongpressure in all its force we shall not arrive at the results which -we all desire. (Hear,hear.) Iwrilonlysay, in conclusion, that Her Majesty's Government have as much at heart the amelioration of the condition of the Italian people as either the Pariament or the people of this country can have, and that all the efforts they can make and all the influence they can bring to bear will be exerted in the endeavour to ameliorate that condition. (Cheers.} The Marquis of CLANRICARDE hoped that no man in Italy would attempt revolution, because it would lead to bloodshed, would probably end in defeat, and -would then onlymake bad worse. Bnt he could only say that the sooner a Government which continued to tyrannize over a people like that of the King of Nlaples, and to oppressthem inamamarwlhichhadbeento-nightstigmatizedas "infamous" the sooner such a Gover-nment was put an end to the better, not only for the peoplegoverned, but for the whole of Earope. What, in- point of fact, kept the King of Naples on the throne? He, as hedodid not hold an official position, had no hesitation in giving utterance to the general belief upon that subject, and that was, that his position was maintained by the Austrian troops which had been allowved to overrun the Italian peninsula from the .ps to Ancona. It was wel known that if any movement took place against the Eing the Austrian forces would come in and suppress the movement. Well, then, it was said by the noble lord that under no circumstances could resort be had to force in order to remedy a state of things which was injurious to Europe at large. [A. gesture of dissent from the Marquis of I3nsdowne.] IN, ell, he was delighted that he had misapErehended the nieaning of the noble earl, but the noble earl ad talked of the inexpediency of the foreign armies being withdrawn from Italy until a better government was established. Why, if their departure were delayed until then, their staywoiuld be indefinite, for they had gone into Italy to support and maintain abad government, and neit to support any amelioration of it. He, for one, anxions as he -was that the powerful-voice of the British Parliarcent might bo of indluence in bringmng about a better state of things, could not press for the production of a correspondence-which the noble earlstated was notyet complete, but he thought that some information as to nets whicl bad been committed in Parma, such as Italians being carried over the Austrian frontier and immured in Austrian dungeons, might well be laid beforethe country. With the exception of Sardina-, a country the independence and integrity of which would always be dear to England, the whole of ltaly was in a state of anarchy. It -was occupied on the one hand by the brigands, and on the other by foreign troops; and such a state of tbings could not long be endured, for the condition of Italy might ultimately affect the balance of power in Europe. It was for the coantry to consider if it were not its duty to employ all its influence, and force even if necessary, to put an end to the occupation by foreign troops of a territory which ought to be independent-an occupation wvhich-was continued for the purpose of maintaining a tyranny not only inJuriousto the persons under its sway, hut disgraceful to the present age. TheXÃ¯Â¿Â½arquisofLANSDOWNEfelt the greatest reluctance in adding a single word to what had fallen from his noble friend, but he wished to refer to one statement which bad been made by the noble marquis. The noble niarquis bad understood his noble friend to say that under no circumstancescould force be employed, aud he had felt it his duty in the momentary absence of lIs noble friend to intimate by a dissenting gesture that such had not been the meanmg of his noble friend. What his noble friend had stated was, that in the present state of affairs with regard toltaly-that inthe present state of negotiations no recourse to force could be expedient, but he by no means laid down the principle that, with regard to that country any more Than with regard to any other country, if the interests of Europe -required it, no application should, under any circumstance, be had to force. On the contrary, his noble friend had stated that there were circumstances under which a recourse to force might not only be necessary, but might be a matter of actual duty. They all were ready to admit that every other means of obtaining an object should be exhausted before recourse was had to force, and, above all, that every step should bh taken, if interference by force should at any tinie be justifiable to convince other Powers of the justioe of the interference, so that the general pesce of the world might not be disturbed. Let their lordships also recollect that at that very moment, when they were talking about interference in the internal affairs of Naples, they were also protesting against the interference of other Powers nm Italy. The present -was not a state of circumstances in which it would be desirable to introduce any new compEcations., and he trusted that those whi-h now existed would pass away, and that the result -would be that interference would be got rid of. altogether. ({ear, hear.) Ee hoped that there existed on the part of the occupying Powers a lbon.fde and deliberat4 intention, in a greater or less degree, to get rid of interference, and the latest inteligence received by the Gorernmnt with respect to Parma indicated an actual disposition to withdraw interference there the moment the system of assacsination -was put an end to. There were now fewer Anetrian troops there, end the number would be gradualy diminished. Concrring as a matter of feeling in the general sentiments expressed by the noble and learned lord, he, nevertheless, thought it was equally the duty of Gorernment to resist beinig led away by such a feeling, and to be firm in abstaining from any measure which might appearto embirrass the question. (Hear, he_r.) He only trusted that if ever interference should beome necessay, it would be vigoronsly conducted, so that it m ht lead speedily to a satisfacory result. He had sireadi Fa id that he entertained souie- doubts as to. t2i tility of twhe prlesent discuasioni'and he therefore would not prolong it, not seeing tbli; way to any imtmediate or useful effect being produtced but by morSJ force He wa ready, howrever, to a.knowledge that thati 3m0ral force might be steghned by the uenio r.~ premion of fe ligintha mhl, iu whichx so mnacl a riey of opinion exided on other ab3ets, an tht itot ultimael have it effec even in tiou fotriemes of preja dice and arbitrarypowrer which were oubtedly the1a places likely to be reached by it. The sbject then dropped. The RAgistrAion of Voters (Sotland) Bill was then reac a third time and p:sd, with amendments The St. Sepulchr's -Manor (Dublin) Bill paed throu& committe PAROCBIAL SCHOOLS (SCOTLAND) BILL. The House went into committee upon this bilL Clauml Itoll were agreed to. The Duke of BUOCLEUCH moved thg omission of clauaU 'The Duke of ARGYLL supported the clause, and expressed his s tuprise hat the noble duke had not stZted the groundsupon which he Proposed its rejection. he present bi was in the natre of a compromise, aud it was the minimum tbhat vould be accepted by a large claw of persons. The question, therefore, was whether their lord.. ships would reiect the present bill with all its acknowledged advantages. The endowments of the church of Scotland rested in that country, as in this, upon the principle of proPerty, while the endowments of the parochial schools resete upon the principle of taxation. It was tberefore neoess&ry to come to Parliament when it was propouedl to raise the income of schools and schoolmasters. o doubt there would be a few Dissenting masters electedf under the bill, but he believed the number would be very small, and if it should have the effect of demonstrating the feasibility of amaamating the teaching of children -ot different sects under one master a great advantage would;. in his opinion, be obtained. In that ntaner the bill iight possibly be the means of founding a more nationalsystem; but, at all events, it would be regarded for many years to caome as a complete settlement of the question. {Bear.) The DuL-e of BIJCOLEUJCH admitted that the bi'l wag very different from the bil of last session, but even this measure was not supported by the classmost interested inu thesubject. Althou{gh therewas a majority for the third reading, the county members were as two to one ag&inst it. The borough members voted for it, and a great deal was sid about neased means of education, but it eater means of education were needed surely the rge towns ought not to be overlooked. i Nothing would have been heard of the bill had not the schoeAn'ateze slaries become so reduced by the alteration. in the prices of corn and other produce as to justify some proposition to meet their case. The connexion of the parochial schools with the established church of Scotland. .ade most intimate ever since theirfirstformation, and he could not help believing that the present bil! was intended to afford an opportunityfor substitating Free Church schoolmasters for masters who were members of the established church. It could not truly he said that the teachiag in the parochial schools at present was at all of a sectarian or exclusive chacter. Their doors were open to children of Roman Catholics, Episcopalians, and Dissenters of all linds, and those children did attend without any complaints on the part of their parents. If anything could be said to be a traly national system he thought the parochial school system of Scotland wsz one. The great majority of those who were taxed to support the schools were he believed, in favour of the existing system, and he womad remind their lordihi of the declaration signed about two years ago by 1,970 beritors of Scotland, who signed their approval of the present svstemand desired the maintenance of the connexmon of tlose schools with the established church; and he knew there was a most anxious desire on the part of the heritors generally to extend the system of education and to increase the salaries of the schoolmasters from their own resources. For himself, it wAs not until after the most anxious consideration and mach communication with persons out of that house that he had come to the conclusion of moving the rejection of the claue He had been pressed to oppose the second reading, but believing therewas much in the measure which was worthy of consideration he had abstained from taldng that extreme course. He, however, felt bound to move the omission of the 12th clause of the bilL Lord PANAT UIRE deniedthat thebill haa originatedain any desire to introduce members of the Free Church as masters. of the parochual schools, and he believed that if the bill were passed in its prsent shape there -woid not t a dozen Free Chnuch schooasters nlominated throughout the whole coeetry. If the cause were rejected, it swomld be almosttan tamounttorzejecting the bill, ferin all probability the other~ House would reintroduce t clause, and if their lordshipst should persst in opposing it the bill woud be lost. ll that ws asked by the bill was that the schoolmaster should be appointe wvithout being required to tale any test. Whether they had a test or net from cheoerso.s keeping these schools their lordships might be suwrethat they woud have none hut Godf earing men in that sitna-- tion. The Earl of HAtyDINGTteo suppored the amendment. Hfeandhis friends wTere willing to accept the bill if thtnoble baron would consent to strike out the clause. Their lordships then divided. The numbers were:~- a FRor the clause... .. .. ..20 Against it .. .. .. .. 0 Majorityagainstthe Government ................ -SO The clause was therefore negatived. In clause 13, The Duke of BUCCLEUCH progosed striking oUt thefrst four-lines of the clause, with the view of inserting other words relating to the qualification of schoolmasters. After some discussion, the noble duke withdrew his smendment) on the understanding that he would agin. bring it forward on the consideration of the report. The clause was then agreed to.. Clause 14 was struck out of the bill and the remaining clauses were agreed to with some amendments. Thie Duke of ARGYLL then intimated to the noble duke opposite (the Duke of Buccleuch) that, in consequence of theanendment which had been caried on a division, the bill could no longer be considered the bill of the Goyernment. The Duke of BUCCALEUCH repudiated the charge of the bill. The measure was brought in by the Government, and, they must take care of it. The House then resumed, and, the rest of the business on. the paper having been disposed of, ,adjourned at a-quarber pastImcock.
HOUSE OF COMMONS, Monday, July 14. The Speaker took the chair at 4 o'clock. Petitions were presented by Mr. Pigott, from the medical. officers of the Reading, Abingdon, and Tyiiemouth Unions j_ also, from the medicalpractitioners. of the parish of Hampstead, praying for a redress of grievances ; by Mr. Dir Pits, from the board of giiardians at Eton, forthe appointmentof county financial boards ;by Mr. Fuller, from Hailsham, praying that aa address may be preseated to the Queea,thnt; she would graciously please to command the closing of all public offices and works on Saturday afternoons, and the opening of the British Museum and the National Gallery and other similar public institutions, and grant her Royal.

THE PARKS. Mr. W. EWART asked the First Commissioner of Public. Works whether it would not be possible, by arrangement or - Mmpromis«, to throw open to the public the ground now given up to-private occupancy in the centre of Hyde Park, between the Humane Society's Receiving-house near the Serpentine and the soldiers' quarters ia the park ? Mr. HINDLEY also asked whether, in the erection o£ the bridge over ihe ornamental water ia St. James's Park, care would be takea not to interfere with the roads, grass, or shrubberies ? Sir B. HALL, in answer to ihe firsi question, said that the ground allnded to had been occupied for a great number cf years by Mr. Stephenson (as wo understood), who, of course, could not be drsturbed daring his life. At some· future time, however, ihe question raised by the hon. member might be a subject for consideration. Wiih regard to tiie question of the ion. member for Ashton, the sus« pension-bridge would be erected in such & position as to interfere as little as possible with the grass and walks.

ZOZWOZ4 TUESDAY, JULY15, Im6 In the House of Lords, lat night, iord L'YHUWsr, pursuant to notice, caled the attention of the House to the affairs of Ity. e niinding the House that it was not in italy alone that they had had experience of the effects of a military occpation by Austria but in the Principalities also, he proceeded to show hoir, by virtue of the Treaty of ioenns, -te limits of the Austrian power were. strictly defined, and how, notwithstanding,- from- timie to time those limits had - been traensressed by it. HIe declined to enter into the inquiry how far that occupation was justified in Italy; but he cDntended that from the time 'when the Austrins passed tha Italian frontier, -seven years ago, they had kept the country in a state of siege and under the domination of mart*i law; and he asLed when such a state of thinfg was to cease? The answer of the Austrian Government to that question was, that they would leave the territory when they could do so without danger of insurrection, but he submitted, the military forco by which they iept possession of the country had 7a continual and inevitable tendency to produce dissatifaction, disturbance, and possibly insurrection among the Italian people. A man, he thought, would be credulous indeed wh- supposed that Anstria would voluntarily quit possesson of Italy, either from a sense of justice, or from the inconvenience it imposed upon the Austrian Govern ment itself; but it might possibly yield to the pressure of France and England acting in concert. He had hoped that ere now that presLsre would have been so exerted as to accomplish the object he had in view. Re didnotmean by that a recouse to arms, but that a moral effect wouild have been produced by that pressure and that combination. Nothing, in his opinion, could exceed the infamous conduct of the Neapolitan Government. lHe adverted, in proof of this, to the well-known pamphlet of Air. GLADsTONE. Hle also cited, in support of his argument, the recent trials for political offences, which, he said, were markedaby a disregard of everyprincipld of justice and the violation of every right~, and were founded on no law, not even the law of arbitrary power. There was no country in the world more open to the power of England than the kingdom of Naples, and, if the RINo had set dur power at defiance, the only interpretation he could put upon the circumstance was, that he haad been influenced by some lukewarmness on the part of France to co-operate rwith us in the object in view. As a contrast to Naples, he pointed the 'attention of the House to the kingdom 'of Sardinia, which, under cincumstances of the greatest difficulty, had succeeded in establishig a free constitution bv the exercise of firmness, vigour, moderation, and wisdom. That constitution, which he trusted Ingland would exert all its power to support and perpetuate, was regarded with jealousy and hatred by Austria, forming as it did, in the estimation of that Power, a most dangerous example to the whole of Italy, and it would do its-utmost to subvert it. Tuning to the consideration of the course to be pursued on the general question, he said the great mass of intelligent men throughout Italy were most moderate in their views, and did not wish to change the limits of the several Governments. But what they desired, and what they were entitled to, was an impartial administration of justice, and a firm, intelligent, and honest administration of their civil affairs. Give them that, and he beliEved the great majority of the Itali'an people would be satsfied. He advised them not to attempt to disturb the boundaries of the several States. There was one way of achieving their indepcendence, and that was through ths cordial union and co-operation of Fiance and England. Thatwasthe only hope of Italy, and he trusted he should hear from Lord CLAnNION that it was one she might reasonably cherish. Austria had only one rule of government, and that was force and coercion. The principle writh her was the people for the Government, and notthe Government for the people; and for such a system to exist in a foreign country and to be supported by bayonets was intolerable in the Last degree. Lord CLsnmnoS, after alluding to the delicacy and difficulty with which this question was environed, said, the correspondence for which Lord Lv---,DuiusT had asked was still incomplete; and he could conceive nothing more calculated to injure the Italian cause than to produce it in its present state. They could not improve Italy by force. They must endeavour to come^ to an understanding with the Governments of those countries, from whom improvement must proceed. There were undoubtedly many flagrant abuseswhich had, to a certain extent, corrupted and deprived Italian society, but they coulld only be remedied by the governing powers, and not by external pressure. It was the hope Of HEB MlrsEsT's Government that the people of Italy were too sagacious, and had had too much experience of revolutions, to have recourse to any such means of effecting their emancipation. At the same time, it would be unjust and cruel for Him MXAxsrr's Governmentto excite inthem expectations which they might not be able to realize. His representations to the Neapolitan Government were made in a friendly sDirit, 'stating the reasons for belie-ing the existing state of things would be daugerous to the stabihty of his throne and fata to the tranquillity of the people, and suggesting, among other things, that all persons, whatever their political opinions, should have security for their personal liberty. An answer was received to those reDresentations last week, but, not having yethad an opportunity to confer with the Emperor of the Prench upon the subject, he thought it would not be desirable at present to lav it upon the table. It was, however, impossible that any answer could be less satisfactory. Adverting tothe reform of the Pontifical States, and the withdrawal of the army from them, he said that question had been enforced on the Powers principally interested, and he believed that Austria desired to withdraw. But, he added, unfortunately the exhibition of confidence in the Italian people had never been attempted, and the policy hitherto had always been fear, founded on the apprehension of immediate revolution, without steps having been ta-ken to ascertainwhetherthosefearswere justifiable. In conclusion, he could onlystate that HER AEsT'S Government had as much at heart the question of the improvement of Italy as thepeople of this country, and they would use every effort to advance it. Lord CLANICAnDE said, it was clear from the statement of Lord CLAmnDoxn that the ing of NÃ¯Â¿Â½r.ms had talken a stand upon his owm absolute independence, and had treated with contumely the attempt of IIER MIAESTs Government to interfere iwith the affairs of his territory. That being so, he I couid not understand why Lord CLr,ox declined to put the House in possession of the correspondence that had ta-en piace. He deprecated the settlement of this question by the intervention of a revolution, as well for the cruelties which would follow in its train as because it would be unsucceasful; but he urged upo Hun MR zsrxsrs Governmeint the 'production of the correspondence between tkien andl the Neapolitan Goverment, as a means of bringing the iight and force of public opinion to bear upn the dispute. The Mfarquis of LAsDow_,'E saia, if ever force should be resorted to ass remedyfor the ex:sting stte of things in Italy, it should only be inl the last ext=rmty, and from a strong convictica of its ab_solube justice. Ho adverted in pa6sing, to the way in 'which thle questiosir wabs complicated by the sulggestion that Hunc M&Air's G$overnment ough1t to interfere in the afaf: 5 of Italy at a time when their Lordibips and the wl,nTe country were deprecating the imterference of other Governments in thoe affairs. He hoped that the application of fore would not be expedien, though he admitted there were circunuztane im which an interference by force might not only be a&righ but a duty. He oneurred in the hope that with regard to other Powers there existed, in a gr3ater or ess degree, a bond. fide and deliberate intention of getting rid of the existing interference in Italy, to which it was desirable for the interests of Euro to put an end; and if eventually interference shoiSd become necessary by England, acting 'ith cther Powers, he trmsted it would be firmly and vigoro.usly applied towards a useful result, though he 'confessed he did not despair of seeing the exni.ting dificulty surmounted boy the apF~ictation of mjoral means The sujbject then tnpped and -their lordihips disposed of the remanimng orc:ers.

There is no State in Europe that can dispute, or that pretends to dispute, the interest of this country in Italian affairs. For all political purposws it is enough that the interest exists. It does indeed exist, and that not merely as a sentiment in the minds of men, but in numerous facts,-in our history, our wars, our diplomacy, and our institutions. Were it only a sentiment, andcould anymatter-of-fact politician taunt us with alowing imagination to trespass into the sphere of realities, even that would be a most unpbilosophical and shortsighted objection; for there is not a war which has not originated insentiment-in some outburst offeeling, or some outrage against it. It was little more than a sentiment that repeatedly iuited all Christendom to recover the RolyLand, and which even the other day broke out like sacred fir from those same " holy "places," and plunged Europe into war. The sentiment of social equalitycaused the war of theFrench Revolution; and a sentiment of more poetical character has since banded Europe to procure the independence of a degenerate race and an insignificant territory, dear to us as the authors and birthplace of our civilization. It is vain to disparage sentiment when it produces such positive and often terrible results, for we might as well affect to be blind to mountains and seas as to creations of the mind not less vast, irresistible, and stormy. But it is something more than mind, something more than a region of fancy, a topic of declamation, a haunt of travellers, and an object of affection that we possess in Italy. From the day that the Roman invaders first indented our shores with their brazen prows and drove their stakes into our hitherto barbarous soil there has always been a political relation of an actual and most influential character between these isles and Italy. As a fact we have derived through that country our religion, the religious sanction of our civil and spiritual rulers, much of our len-I guage, and a considerable portion of our law. As a fact Rome stil asserts a spiritual dominion over the whole of our population, and six or seven millions of our people aclmowledge the claim As a fact the tenets of faith and the laws of conscience that guide those millions, for good or for evil, are defined, proclaimed, extended, and elaborated at Rome. It is not only the hope of Romne, but the very foundation of its -claims, that it is one day to reconquer the whole mind and institutions of this country. The same facts are more or less true of all the other countries of western and middle Europe; and if there be, as there is, a large portion of Europe where such claims are not admitted, it is through the presence of a rival and antagonist system, which still admits the principle of universal dominion. On the other haud, there never has been a great potentate, conqueror, or Power north of the Alps, that has not acted in this relation, and attempted either the conquest of Italy or a preponderance in Italian affairs. In fact, the Italy of politics is not a geographical, but a universal idea. The mistrem of the world has lost her sceptre, but she is not less the o'ject of common solicitude. Italy itself cannot disclaim a relation which pervades her annals and adds so much to her dignity. If, as was intim;ded lst night, one wietched Sovereign in that famous peninsula has lately claimod for himcelf the privilege of not being interfered with, it is the instinct of a barbarian oocupying a site of which he 1Iow9 not the genius and traditions. 'Vhen, therefore, Lord LmNDnusr in the one house, and Lord Jom- RussmL in the other, bring before Parliament the present date of Italy, and when they protest against the ingovernment of its own rulers and its occusMtion by foreigners, they are only choosing their own [time and mainer of doing that which ha evor been done, and will stl be doxie, in th oountry. Unque*.tonably, we ha,e a tocus stGndi ia Itian affairs, and if we desired ever so much to give it up, neither would other nations nor Italy herself desire us to do Po. No effort, no silence, no wisdom, no folly of our statesnen could prevent Italy, and the great European Powers that' Use Italy for their own purposes, from being a powerful element in the fortunes of our empire. We have no alternative, then, but to use the influence of our great name and our counsels to the best of our discretion; and every statesman who assumes a high position among us is fully justified, and to a certain extent. compelled, to declare himself on the subject. - It is not, of course, to be expected that we should be always preparing an active interference in the affairs of Italy, if only because it is not in our power to carry out any plan of active interference without the aid of others; and the attempt without success woulId do much more harm than good. But we cannot, in justice to ourselves, give up the exercise of that voice' which we have had from all time, nor can we omit to notice anything actually novel and extraordinary in the condition of the Peninsula..' No doubt, that condition does now present some strange and alarming features. There maynot, indeed, be-a distinct apprehension of evil,-of any conquest, or revolution, or anarchy, to be averted. If interference is never justifiable, except on the warnings of political 'second Bight, to avert some specific disaster, then we have nothing to do- but to sit still and await the progress of ruin. It is sufficient that there are actual ills and irregularities, whatever their probable results. Rome is stiUl under the protection of France, and, though France will probably soon have withdrawn every soldier, it is impossible not to look forward with dread to the day when the PorP shall be left to the loyalty of his own temporal subjects. The Two Sicilies, with the strongest claims to the interest of this country, and peculiarly amenable to our power, are suffering a capricious and cruel despotism. The Legations are occupied by Austrian troops and governed byAustrian military law, the result of which is sufficiently proved by the excuso given for a continuance of that state of things-viz., that thle withdrawal of the troops would be the signal for revolution and massacre. In point of fact, and to all practical purpose, Austria. has annexed these new provinces of Italy to her military dominion. She has quartered her army upon their resources; she recruits it from their population; she makes them contribute to the maintenance of her empire, and act as the advanced post of her designs upon Italy. She compels even Sardinia to exhaust herself by defences wholly out of proportion to her territory and population. These operations may or may not be intended to hasten the conquest of Italy, and that event may or may not be possible. In the face of history we should hardly venture to maintain that Italy was ever likely to be reduced to one foreign bondage; but the very attempt on the part of Austria would plunge Europe into war, and it is therefore very important to anticipate designs the very thought of which is dangerous to the power, happiness, and progress of the civilized world. Should war or revolution break out in Italy, England would soon find herself compelled to interfere; and no one can say how far the war would extend, or how long it would last. It would then be asked why our Government had not averted such a pass by pacific and timely interference. That is what has been attempted, nor can more be done. Neither Lord L-NHDURST nor Lord JoHN Russzx could expect more. Should that moderate degree of interference be rejected, and should the more powerful States concerned follow tho example of the King of the Two Sicxs, by demandinA_ tojlo WbatA +^1 IF-A _ A-nelr own, or rams w1ia6 is not their own, we cannot hope to see the peace of the Peninsula long preserved. The political state of that famous territory may be very complex, but there is nothing in it to prevent some common action in the foundation. of responsible Governments, the purification of the judicial system, and the general policy of relying with confidence on the favour of the people. A policy of this sort has made a change in the kingdom of Sardinia that it would have required much faith to believe possible 20 years ago; ancd, no doubt, that improvement would have been still more striking but for the immense expense entailed upon Sardinia by the menacing attitude of her formidable neighbour in Italy. The present condition of the other Italian States is such that on our own principles it is impossible not to think revolution itself the least of two evils. It is true that hope itself is disheartened by the destiny which has so long distracted and degraded the country which, united, once overcame the liberties of the world. Nevertheless, if it is not possible to effect a great Italian restoration, it may be possible to prevent the existing ills from ripening to their natural results. These natural results we believe to be another embroilment in the site of the empire of the West such as that we have lately seen in the old empire of the East, vith, possibly, not so early nor so happy a termination.
The resignation of Lord EARWINGE and the appointment of the Duke of CABImmGE to the office of Commander-in-Chief will excite little surprise in any quarter. It is perfectly natural that a nobleman full of years and honours, of shaken health, and recently visited with severe indisposition, should resign a situation to the i weight of which he no longer feels equal, and I retire into private life, to enjoy the repose which the honourable toils of half a century have so justly earned. It was the misfortune of Lord HBADxNCE to succeed to the Command-in-Chief of the army at a time of4ife when very few men, id any, are equal to the task of a n-former, andc to be involved almost immediately in: ffhe cares and anxieties of a great war, which, scarcely leaving him time to overtake the current business of the day, gave but little scope for improvement. Yet it is only due to Lord HAnDINGE to record that in matters within his own peculiar province, such as the arming and lodging of the troops, he has, first as Master-General of the Ordnance, and then as Commander-in-Chief, effected great and most salutary alterations. To him we owe it that we had any artillery at all wherewith to commence the Russian war, and under his auspices our troops have been armed with the I lini6 rifle, and ourbarrac'k accommodation greatly increased and improved. Of the patronage department we cannot say so rmuch, but in awarding promotion and preferment the Commander-in-Chief is generally regarded, and we believe justly, as the organ of the Court, and if with the Court rests the patronage, with it also, in all fairnews, ought to rest the responsibility. No one wiU be surprised that his Royal Highness the Duke of CuawnIDE has been named to succeed Lord HAGnmE. His illutrious birth, his popular manners, his undisputed merits as an officer, and the amount of actual service he has seen in the Crimea, all so clearly indicated the Duke of CAinnGE as Lord HAnSDIGOS succesor that nobody else had been serioudy named in competition with him. For our own part, we confess that, without indulging in any exaggerated expectation, we cannot see 'hat, even setting aside the accidenU of birth and position, a better choice wa open to the Government. we have arrived at a period in our militar wnm&U at which a very xweeping change of syrtem has bocome absolutely eseatial, and it would hare beea hopeles to loolk for such a change if the office of Commanderin-Chief had been placed in the hands of any of the veterans of the Peninsula, who have learnt nothing and forgotten nothing since the conclusion of the French war. It is something to have got out of this groove, and comuarative youth and comparative inexperience are in the present instance something very like a positive recommendation. Nobody can doubt that the Duke, of CAiBRIDGE will be actuated in the discharge of his duties by the best and the most praiseworthy motives, and we are willing to hope that these good intentions will be seconded by enlightened and liberal views, and careful and untiring application. We have not learnt upon what terms the office has been conferred on its present possessor, and whether the wishes of -Parliament and the country have been acceded to by rendering hini in reality what he is in name,-the General Commanding the Forces of HER M&JeSTY in these islands; and transferring the rest of the auithority of the Horse Guards to the depariment of the Minister-of-War. The change, whether made now or not, cannot.be long deferred; but, supposing the patronage still to remain in the hands of the Conunander-in-Chief, the Duke of CA-sBRhGoE has facilities for bestowing it probably greater than have been enjoyed by his predecessor, or would have been enjoyed by any one else who might havo succeeded to the office. The evil of the patronage of the Horse Guards has been that it'has only been nominally exercised by the Commanderin-Chief, but in substance and reality by the Court, who, by a most unwise exception to our ordinary rule, lhve been exposed to that unlimited censure which is sure to visit tne least reprehensible acts of irresponsible power in a free country. If the Commander-in-Chief is to be left in possession of patronage, the Commander-in-Chief ought to exercise that patronage himself, according to the promptings -of his own judgment, and not under the direction of any superior power. Now, this is exactly what his high rank and independent position enable the Dukc of CABre=IDG to do, and whIat, if he have any regard for his own reputation, he will from the first resolve to do. The wishes of the Court, however diflicult it may be for an ordinary subject to resist them, will not be accepted as an excuse from the scion of the selfsame Rtoyal house, who has nothing to fear from the frowns and nothing to hope from the favours of the heads of his family. The Duker of - CAmnRIDOG has, if he be so minded, a- noble career before him; he may, if he please, earn for himself an imperishable reputation for having adapted our military system to tne wants of the age and the exigencies of modern opinion. He is believed to entertain most benevolent feelings towards the common soldier, and to have gathered from his eastern experience a very high opinion of his merits and capabilities. We trust that in his hands those efforts which have been making of late years for the improvement and elevation of the soldier will not be allowed to relax. A commission is sitting to inquire into the merits of the system of purchase. Iet us hope that the influence of the Commander-inChief will be employed to seoure to merit its due reward, and to deprive mere birth and connexion of the preponderating advantages they now enjoy. Whether this is to be done by the abolition of the system of purchase or by the introduction of a stricter system of examination than that now in force it would be presumptuous to speculate; but, in whatever way investigation points out success as most attainable, we shall hope Vith some confidence for the support of the new head of the army. For one thing, above all Asw +~~~~~~~Tul 3 . s- e- lineld :e sponsible-that is, for the choice of his advisers. If he begins by allowing incompetent persons to be placed about him, merely on account of the amount of influence they may possess, no efforts, no good intentions- of his own, will renmedy this incurable defect. Mfuch of the success of his adninistration depends on tbose whom he may select to conduct it under him, and if he suffers the choice of those persons to be taken out of his hands he will have himself alone to thank for the disappointments and miscarriages which are certain to follow. We heartily wish the Duke of CAMBRImGE success in his difficult and perilous undertaking. That success can only be *ultimately secured to him by conciliating the good opinion of the people, and that good opinion can only be conciliated by a course at once liberal and enlightened, firm and independent.
There is a species fotmisery which no laws can reach and for which no effort of any Government can offer a remedy. We may bring our municipal regulations never so much into harmony with the lawis of economic science; we may establish in all corners of the kingdom houses of refuge in which any British subject may find a resource against actual starvation at least; but, when all is done, much will be left undone. Where legislation einds charity begins-not the mere charity which gives alrs and subscribes to hospitals, but that more active and intelligent principle which should prompt as many of us as are blessed by PRovI- I DENCE with more abundant means to exert ourselves within our own particuilar spheres of aetion for the benefit of our fellow-creatures. Now for the application of these few general words. There appeared in our impression of Saturday a report which, as we tru-st, attracted the attention of most of our readers. It referred to the miserable condition of the seamstresses and needlewomen of this metropolis. Lord 3RoBERT GrRosvEwon was the chairuman of a meeting which was held on Friday last to take their position into consideration. The Earl of SHArrzsnuny was there, and the Bishop of OxFoRn, and many other benevolent persons, for the most part ladies. ln'the course of the several addresses delivered the speakers described in very forcible terms the misery of these poor creatures. Conceive the condition of young girls just of that age when the world should offer them a brief space of cheerfulness and recreation before the cares of life have closed around their path, and who yet by their unfortunate position are condemned to unceasing imprisonment and hard labour, with all the terrible consequences of shattered nerves and broken health. We do not wish, however, to argue this question upon the high sentimental ground whic}ihas been taken by the regular manufacturers of pathos. We freely admit that the supply of young Duchemes and of SXPIuxrKA BULMroNs is, and must, for all we can see, remain extremely limited in amount. We are not setting it out as a reproach against human nature that every young milliner has not at her command a broughara, an opera-box, or at least a stall. Work they must, and spend what few yeas may be assigned to them upon earth in a humble position; but it in not the less an opprobrium UPon this great town ana upon our boasted civilization that young girls by thousands and tens of thousands are, within the limits of London, exposed every day to sufferings of the most real kind. There is no need of exaggerating the mizery of the imfortunate persons whose case we am'e endeavouring to state; indeed, so great- are ther sufferings that exaggeration -would be beyond '-&-eN powers of ordinary men. The simple truth we belieye to be this --There are many thousands of young girls in London who are compeled to seek their living by the ordinary process of needlew work, and who are not much affected by the course of the London seaon. Their lot is painu in the extreme, but, we say it with the most heartfelt regret, we are unable to suggest any remedy for it. Where there is one shirt to be made, and six young women are ready to maake it, one prepared to work at a cheaper rate than the other, who is to step in and say that their employers shall I lay a higher rather than a lower price for the execution of the task? Any plan that would lessen the number of applicants for the work would, no doubt, ease the pressure upon those who remcin. The misortune is, that in England so few cocupations are open to women. When the category of domestic service is exhausted, to -what but to their needle can they look for support? Tle needle has slain more victims than the sword, and in a far more cruel manner, but as yet we have not heard of a suggestion which would enable us to deal with the evil. It woufld Beem to be desirable that -women should be employed in shops to a far greater extent than at present. Whenever hard fate has thrust upon us the honour of attending ladies in their shopping excursions we must confess that we have always contemplated Messrs. SAnS,NxT and DinrWr's " young men" with the eye of a recruiting sergeant or' a boatswain's mate. There may be difficulties in the way which we do not foresee, disturbing forces which we cannot appreciate, but it certainly would appear as though young women might be employed to a far greater extent than at present in retail shops, eepecially in those which deal in articles of a lady's apparel. A short time back- it was suggested by. a correspondent, who addressed a letter to this journal, that women might find occupations suitable to their strength in various processes connected with the manufacture of watches. In Switzerland, it ia said, a very numerous section of the female population do actually employ themselves in this manner, and that the . work is better done by them than it would be by men. On such a point, of course, we do not assume to speak with any great authority, but surely there muist be many industrial processes which could be adairably performed by women. Iaws upon such a subject would be ridiculous. The point must be left to the good feeling of the community. If every employer of labour would do all that one person could accomplish within his own sphere, we might look for a far better result than any which has -yet been obtained. We have been spealding thus far manly of the great body of seamstresses, but, unless we misapprehend the more immediate objects of the speakers at the meeting on Friday last, their efforts were rather pointed a. the alleviation of the suferings of a special class. Apart from the great body of work-women there is a section which is more directly concerned with the proceedings of the London season. For four or five months of the year a sad strain is iept -up on these poor girls, partly arising from want of consideration on the part of ladies who will not give their orders in time, partly from the avarice of the actual employers, who seek to increase their gains by unduly taxing the powers of an insufficient number of hands. There is no remedy for the first evil except in the good sense and good feeling of the customers, and even in the second case they could accomplish much. We are not justified in bringing wholesale accusations aggainst the fashionable modistes of the metropolis, for no doubt their trade is of a peculiar kind. A very considerable portion of their business must be executedI by highly skilled hands, and it is imfair to them to expect that they 1h1n-lA eneapf e'n - - -man a staif capable of dealing with the average business of the house. An emergency arises, ancd the work must be done. They cannot on the instant engage half-a-dozen or a dozen fresh hands to tide them over the difficulty. They can only employ persons on whose skill they can depend, or they would most certainly fail in giving satisfaction to their customers. In such a case they have, perhaps, no option but to overtask the powers of the young women in their employment. When every allowance, however, has been made on this score we fear it will be found that many of them have still a heavy bill to settle with humanity, and that they do actually overworlk their hands in a very cruel manner. We can only, in the absence of a legislative enactment, which would certainly be evaded, earnestly recommend aU ladies who are conscious that their own thoughtlessness has not been the cause of the evil to withdraw their custom from any establishment which is notorious for inhamanity in the treatment of workwomen. In conclusion, we venture with all deference to sugest to the Earl of SHAxsnurxY, to Lord :RoBnT GnosvExon, to the :Bishop of OxroBD, and to all persons who attended the meeting on Friday, that their proceedings would have had far greater significance had they been at the commencement rather than at the close of the London season. Even Simo2i LEGREE desisted from scoring the backs of his negroes when " crop time" was over. The London " crop" has been pretty nearly gathered, and just as relief would come in the ordinary course of things these gentlemen step in. Why should not a meetmg of this kind be held at the opengn of every London season?

REVIEW AT WOOLWICH. Yesterday the Qaeen reviewedat Woolwrieallte - of the Royal Horse and Yoot ArtiUery recesty retrne from the Crimea, and, owing to the favoerabZ state of the weatherand the presence of J brillit atseembl4a of visitors the spectade was exceediJgly picturesque and stiking. There were upon the ground 3,500 mei 2,450 horm*, and 52 guns, of which 15 belornged to the Horse Artillery aid the remainder to the field batteries. The troope were drawn. up in contiguous colamns of bxtteries, the lineexesd3ng from the deep fence which bounds the Parde to that portion of Shooters-hillrwhich skirts thb Doier-a- dis tance of something like 1,000 yards. The majority of the guns were vf 91b. calibre, with 241b. howitzers, but there werefoar batteries of 18-pounders, and a howitzer battery of 32-pounders, which did some service at the battle cf the Tchernays. Tbis fine park of artillery was ranged precisely as on a field. of battle, the guns n front, and the tumbrils and ammunition waggoas in lines three deep in the rear. The men attrwacted universl zdmiration by their splendid appeermce, the precision and celerity of their movementr, and thfir perfect discipline. In the centre of the ground was stationed the excellent band of the Artillery, which created a conflict of emotions by mingling the sentimn , "There is no place like home," with melodions admonitions to set out forthwith for Syria. The Qaeen, accompanied by PrinceAlbert, the Prince and Princess of Prassia, Pricess Louise of Prussia, and the Dalue of Cambridge, and attended by a brilliaut retinue, arrived infront of the Artillery Barracks at I1 o'clock. The Rooyal party had travelled from Buckingham PSalae in open carriages and four, and were receivedby Gene ral SirW.F.Williams, of Ears, Commandant of the Gr:ison, hisstaff, aud a Guard of Honour of the Royal Marines.. Her Majesty wore a scarletridinghabit trimmed with gold lace, in herhat a mnilitaryplume of whiteandredfeathers, and acro3s her left shoulder the sash of a general offilcer and the riband of the Garter. Prince Albert wore the aniform of a Field. Marshal, the Dluke of Cambridge that of a general officer. The Prince of Prmssia alo was in military costume. Having alighted from her carriage, Her Majesty mounted her favourite chestnut charger, and repaired to the reviewr ground, the Prince cf Prussia iiding on her rignt, and Princa Aibert and the Dake of Cambridge on her left. Thea came a glittering group of officers, splendidly mounted, among whom we observed the Earl of Cardigan, General Cator, General Sir lHew Ross, General Gray, Colonel Hardinge, Colonel Anderson, Colonel M'DonalU, Colonel Gordon, Colonel Wetherall, and Colonel Ward, in command of the Horse Artillery. Lady-,W'Donald, Iady-in-Waiting to the Qaeen, also rode on hwsebiAck, and the carriages of the Princesses of Prussia and their suite followea. The illustrious party rode leisurely along the front of the line and then down the rear, while the bandplayed the national anthem and the Greenhill Battery fired a Royal salate. The Court then toolk up their position beside the fIagstaff erected in front of the Royal tilitary Academy, and the troops marched past them in gay and glittering array. The Royal Horse Artillery, headed by Colonel Henry, who lost an arm in the Crimea, took the lead, advancing im columns of troops. Next followed the field batteries, marching in columns of batteries six guns abreast. each battery having in its train its respective lines of attendint ammunition waggons, most of them drawn by horses, but some few of them by Austrian mmies. The batteries moved at quarter distance, and the scene occasionally acquired a ludicrous interest from the grotesque apparition. in the intervening spaces of a ragged dog, a black sheep, a shaggy goat, or some other fond, familiar creature, which the men had brought wi'.hthemfromtheCruinea. Alussian donkey, which an inordinate zeal for gunnery, a truant disposition, or the pur.suit ofthistles underdifficulties hadlurel into one of the redoubts oflaLermann,wherehewascaptureI by our soldiers, was an object of particular attentior. Around :iis neck was knotted a costly sabretash, and, thus accoutred, his appearance evoked cordial acclamations; but it is due to him to say that he bore his honoursmeelcy, ant that there was nothing in his demeanour to warrant the suppDwition that he was the first animal of his species who had worn such an ornament. - Among the pets of the Artillery there is also a camel, but this "ship of the desert" was at aLcnhor and did not make its appearance. After marching past the flagstaff in slow time, the field batteries wheeled round, made a circuit of the Common, and passed a second time at a swinging trot, with the gunners mounted on the limbers. The field batteries having. drawn off fronting the Queen, the Horse Artillery then dashed Pas at full gallop. be still more impressive were it -ot for the cload of dust thrown up by the horses' hoofs, which obstructs the atmosphere and dims the glory of the scene. A driver who was thrown from his horse yester day, but forturately sustained no injury, was amntched in Il,, instant from the vision of the spectators by a whirlwnd cE dust, remiLnding one of the droll criticism on ons of Horace Vernet's battle-pieces, representing the fall from his horse of Marshal Victor at the Battle of MedeDlin :-" On no voit pas le Mar6chal A cause de son cheval, qu est tomb6 sur lui, et on ne voit pas le cheval d cause de la poussiere." After the march past, the troops advanced in line and saluted, the band playing " Cheer, boys, cheer." They then retired, sad the gunners and drivers dismounting formed in line in front of the bat. teries. In this order the Queen again inspected the troops} pa;ing particular attention to such of the men as wore the fou-clap medal This ceremony concluded, the troops gave three rounds of hearty cheers for Her Majesty, who, with the Royal party, then quitted the review-ground, and returned to town in her carriage. There were no manceuvres, and the whole proceedings were over in an hour and a-quarter. The ground was kept by Artillerymen and Marines, assisted by a large body of police from London, under the commacnd of Superintendent Malieu. Therailway arrangements on this occasion w ere execrable. Nothing could be worse. The trains travelled at a snail's pace, and the exit from the stationat Woolwich, through which many hundreds of people had to pass, was a ver.? smaull door, which, being only half opened, afforded an aperture about a foot wide. Great was the dissatisfaction of the vast crowd, which, to the rain of their clothes and the no sma'l injury of their ribs, had to squeeze their war throughthis nrrow pasage; but ths officeefs reply to all remonstranoes was, that if the door were fully opened na one man could colleet the tickets. That is very possible, but surely the obvious remedy was to have employed two collectors.

The idea of the separation of the spiritual froin thetemporal Dower of the Pope seems to be gaining ground among the clergy at home and abroad; but 3t is paticularly in Italy, ard in Rome itself that the abdication of that power is looked upon as inevitable, and the only safe solution of an important uaestion. "It is imagined in France," o'baerves - the,AblaiMichon, to whosg acok I have already-alluded, " That the eminent members of the clergy of Rome hold I greatly to the temporal power of the Pope. That opinion is, indeed, so rooted in the religious world, that to speak of the Sovereign Pontiff as freed from his temporal mission is the same as to say that there is no Pope at alL. Now, ex. cept the party at Rome, who are naturally iaterested in tho maintenance of the present organization, there is a consider. able number of superior men who anticipate such a solution, and who, far from being frightened at it, either for the Papacy or for the Church; awalt on this point the wll. of lProvidence, and are ready to hail a separation, froma -whicb, according to them, the Church must derive im. maense benefit. These men are found among the congrega. tions, with whom the thought of directing souls by temporal means least prevails, and vho have preserved the ideas of Christian independence and the poverty of their holy Eonnder; these are found even in the Sacred College. "In fact, the ideas on that point have so advanced t | Rome that last ycAr the question of the separation of the temporal power was formally mooted in full consistory by one of the most eminent men of the Roman Church, Cardinal Idaini, who in a remarkable address, to which no conr tradiction was given, declared that the temporal power attached to the spiritual sovereignty of the Pope was the great obstacle to the welfare of the Church. The Cardinal examined the question from every point of view. He -dwelt particularly on the fact that Rome, being the first Poower of the wvorld in its spiritual character, had become 'by its connexion vwith temporal authority a paltry State of the fourth or fifth rank; that consequently this power only diminished its spiritual and moral greatness, and that the spiritual power did not in any degree exalt the petty sovezeigpty of which it supported the burden. "Indeed, the Sovereign Pontiff is himself so much imbund 'with these ideas, that in the month of December, 1854, ,during the Convocation ofthe Bishops for the proclamation ,of the Immnaculate Conception, and in a secret meeting at the V3tican, at which only the French Bishops were present, he expressed a wish to know from them iV, in the event of being forced by politic-l causes to quit his States, he could count on a friendlyreception in France. It is - hardly necessary to say -what the answer was. France, 'where so many sincere Catholics are still found, wouldbe toe happy to realize the engagement accepted in her naine by our venerable bishops." On the question of transferring to Jerusalem the w-eat of the Papal authority, the Abbe Miclon salys . "In the course of the yearl855, while the warmi the Fas; ssas in all its iorce, and when a complication of affairs might be dreaded in E:urope, that solution 'was proposed to the Pontifical Government. Complete liberty of action wasgus. --znteed to the Sovereign Pontiff at Jerusalem; the mean3 -of maintaining is an honourable manner his high dignity vere secured to him; while a railroad from Jerusailem to Jaffa would render tho communication of the Papacy vith vb`rM was tnnote3;irreteabfe-U 1t'f -)IThlCet prrw on.< Rome, who were unwiling to e-change a residence in a great and splendid city for that of the humble Jerusalem :But in the face of new complications the proposition would eencounter less opposition if the more reflecting persons at Rome accepted that plan, as the most honourable for the Papacy, though it might impose on some men sacrifices which are evidently not beyond the strength ofsouls. that are seriously Christiau." The Abbe examines the question theologically, ad, as to whether the Pope can transfer the apcstolic seat to any other place than Rome, he says "The greater number of theologians declare for the affumative. They maintain that the Sovereign- Pontlir is perfectly free to establish himself where he pleases. Accord. Ing to them Jesus Christ gave the Primacy to Peter, but Zid not make hia Bishop of Rome, and in what place 'oever he may be the Pope still preserves his primacy. _Bellarmine, whose authority is above suspicion, says- 'Tine Bishop of Rome is not the successor of Peter, but of ihe e_t of Peter, and not from the first institution of esu, Christ, for Peter aeed not have chosen that particular seat, as he did the first five years, and in that case, at his death, neither the Bishop of Rome nor of Antioch would have s-cceeded him, but only the person whom the church elect. eed. He could have remained at Antioch, and theni the Bishop of Antioch vrould have succeeded him.' The Papacy -is, therefore, inherent in the successors of Peter in what place scever be the seat. WVhen Pius VL, dying at Valence, .expressed his regret at ending his days in exile, the Cardinal who attended him was quite right when he said ' Holy Bather, the Pops is everywhere in his country."' It is remarkable that the little pamphlet of the Abbe Michon, who is, according to all accounts, a hlthly eXemplary clergyman, and the author of several works on religion, has not been noticed in .any of the Ultramontane prints. AUSTRTA. (FROM OUR OWN CosRRsPoDr.N-Tr.) VIENlA. Juxy 9. Prince Petrulla, the Neapolitan Minister, has recently had several conferences wvith Count Iluol, and it has transpired that the ing of 1'aples is not more inclined to attend to the counsels of Austria than to the remonstrances of the WVestern Powers. It has been stated by eome of the foreign papers that the Neapolitan Government is encouraged by Austria to resist the demands made by England and France; but you mnay be assured that such is not the case. The Ianperial Cabinet is of. opinion that the Western powers have no right to force the King of Naples to mnake any internal changes; but it is a patent fact that it has given His Majesty more good advice than lisa proved palatable. The Vienna Presse contains an article on the state of the kingrdom of Naples which will prove distasteful tothi Govenmnet, whose object it is to prevent any active intervention on the part of the Western Powers. The Vienna journalist, after remarking that there are persons 'who deny, that England and France have a riglht to interfere between the King of FNaples and his subjects, writes as follows:- "If we sco our neighbours house about to take fire it is - eur duty to force the door, if no other means of arriving at the seat of danger presents itself.. In the same way the Powers are justified is interfering ill the af_airs- of Naples. It is tree that the Neapolitan Government questions their right to do so, and refases to listen to their remonstrances-: 'tut it is not to -be supposed that the Western Powers will beastisaflduntilthey bave effected their enlightened perpsse. It would be traly-lamentable if the stubborn res ance of Naples should lead to measures. and demonstra.. tions which might possibly disturb the peace so recently restored" The FranZfort Post Zeuitng has received intelligence from Vienna relative to Rome which does riot exactly tally with the infornmation that Ias reached mne. The correspondent writes that 'tbhe Pope has ordered the reforms suggested by the Austrian Governmentto be carried out. --It is- pro-' bable that His Holiness listened with attention to Baron Werner, but you may be sure that Cardinal AntonejIli and his colleagues will take care that the slghtestpossible concession shall be made to public opilnion, lhe Vienna C,or,iere ItaUiavo, which ha3 is ownt correspondents in the differentitalian States, contiuMally contains accounts of robberies and murders which have been comnmitted in the doneinions of the Church.

ITALiY. (FROM Oul. OW' corm.RIPONVDMT.)- TURINg, JuLy 10. The intelligence which reaches me to-day from Lomnbardy is impotant, and is so well authenticated that i1 give it to you at once, although theie is no othiernews to communicate. It seems, then, that the 5th Corps d'Arnne, which is stationed in Lombardy, has just been reinforced by a brigade sent from Wantta to Bergamo. At the same time a brigade, composed of the.Gyulai Regiment of Infantr&, a battalion of Classeur, -a battery of Artilery, and,a pontoon train, unlder command of General Lilia, has been despatched in all haste from Milan to Cremoia. Mily informant, who is well aware of the custom of the Austrian authlorities so. mystify the public as to the . actual force in Italy by marches and counter-marches, and increasing -or diminishinig the size of the companies, assures me that this augmentation is b&nlfde as far as Lombardy is concerned, but whether it will be compensated by an equivalent reduetion in other parts of Italy of course ke is unable to say. Every one coniing from the other side of the Ticino brings the i same tidings, which it is almost unnecessary to re- t peat-that the Lombuids are very much excited at this constant movement of troops, not knowing what to make bf it, while all kinds of rumours are put into circulation by agents of the poEces with a i view to spread consternation and create distrust-of Piedmont and her allies. Among the many public worls recently coni- pleted, now in progress, or about to be cinmienced' in this- country, there are none which mark more distinctly the advancement, both morally and phy-. sically, made under the r6e7e of libeoral 'institutiona and free trade than the construetion of conmmercial docks at Genoa.. Until the railway which pierces the Appennines and brings Genoa into easy conmun-ication with the plain of Lombardy -was in full worli the absolute necessity for this improvementAdid'not press itself on tho citizens generally, althoughthc merchants have long been complainiing of the want of wharfage, the want of stores, the delaa in loading and discharging cargoes, and the consequent expense of vessels detained in port. The traditional spirit of oppo3ition to everythiig Piedmontese was so strong in the ancient Republic that up to a very recent period everything done by the Sardinian Governinent to facilitate trade was ascribed to a wish to favour Piedmont alone, and works that conferred. most evident benefits on Genoa were regarded with suspicion as the offerings of a covert enemy. The idea of allowing the arsenal whence the victorious galleysof the Republic issued in the olden time to be converted inito commercial docks and. warehouses, and transferring the head-quarters of theRoyal navyto Spezzia,(whi6b,as everyoneknows, is one of the finest barbours in the Mediterranean,) was so repugnant to Genoese prejudices that for six years the Government has postponed -its intentions cn that subject, in great part fromndeference to those fee'ings.. Lately, however, anotable change has come over public opinion in many ways, and a conviction woulfc seem to have forced itself on the citizens of Genoa that they will best selve their own interesti by acting in concert with, instead of in oppositionto, the Government, and this has been perhaps the mest difficult and certainly-not the least important of a series of moral victories3 which Piedmontese principles have obtained in Italy oi late vears. The decree for commencincg immediately the for. I tifications at Alessandria Was signed by the Eing vesterday. He therein orders the siim of 1,000,000f. to be rnaid from the Treasury for the expenses of the hamen---- ;- _t.'Ination of the meeting of ParYesterday morningamarble stathe of the statesman and author, Cmesar Balbo, by-the celebrated artist Yela, was inaugurated at Turin, in the presence of a large concourse of people, among uhom were several Ministers, the widow and sons of Count Balbo, cenrators, depuaties, &c. When theI covering was removed by the artist a burst of applause issued from the crowd at the' extreme hL-eness of the features, and Count Sclopis made a short but eloquent speech, in which he recalled the traditional patriotism of the faiily of Balbo, and alluded to the sons of Count Ciesar then present, who had just returned from the Crimea, which elicited further cheering from the crowd. The posthumous works of the Abbe Gioberti are ab'out to be given to the world under the editorshiip of his faithful friend and disciple GiuseppeMassarn, the conmmittee named by his heirs having at length signed a contract with the publisher for the purpose. These fragments of the eminent churchman appear to have been written with a view to another great work on his favourite theme of separating the spiritual firom the tempoisl power at Rome, and reforming the discipline of the Church, without infringing on the dogmas of religion; and as this is a subject to whinc the attention of the Cathnoli community is more than usually directed at the present moment, as the only effectual means of securing those reforms in the civil government of Rome so desirable for the suppression of the scandal entailed on the church under the present system, their publication is looked forward to in Italy with the greatest interest. Tord Panmure has forwarded to the Sardinian Government a copy of a, report received by- him from Sir William Codrinmgton on the Sardinian army in the Crimea. Sir Wilam speaks in terms of the highest praise of the conduct of tnose troops, both in the field and in quarters, and adds his testimony to the opinion of alL who have-seen the Sardinian army of its admirable discipline and general efficiency. The report has, I understand, given muc'h satisfaction to the Government here, and will be made public in a day or two. King Victor Emmanuel has been pleased to confer the rank and' decoration of Commander of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus on Captain Brockl, R.N., who has been employed as Britislh transport -agent at Genoa ever since Sardinia joined the Western alliance. There is a report in Turin to-day that Marshal Radetzky has recalled Count Crenneville from Paima, and replaced him by General Szeth, a Hun garian offlcer, who e'njoys the reputation of being less overbearirg than his predecessor. The report is by no means improbable, but as yet- has not been confirmed. i . - it is said at Florence that MonsignorFranchl, the successor of Monsignor Massoni as Papal Nuncios las great hopes of accomplishing the great work of the concordat left unfinished by the latter, and :it was thought that the nomination Oe a niew archbishop, rendered necessary by the decease on e onsignor Minucci, wvould also :be taken ad.vantae of to forward the same object. I have seen a letter from Rome of the 5th, whicix describes the partin of :the Pope and the King ot Maples on the beach at Porto d'Anzio, a few even,iings before, as something quite melodramatic. Thg7 | King on taking leave prostrated himself on the ! shin'le his whoT length, a4nd fervently embraced his i Holiness'Bfeet,sheddingtears the while, and humbly asking his blessing. This having been accorded His Mlajesty took ship forbhis own dominions, -where . he knows wellhow to treat Churchmen after a-very. - different style. Yesterday Turin was visited by a violent squaII from the south-west, which carried - away a considerable number of chimneypots- and broke a good. many windows. It does not appear to hxve produced much harm to the crops in the neighbourhood of the. town,, as it was not accompanied by hail as usual - but in other parts of the couintry it has most likely done iniuch mischief. -- The P-iedmonwfese Gazette of the 10th instant publishes the following report, addressed to the King by the Minister of lWar in the Cabinet 'Council held at the Royal Castle of Pollenzo on the 8th of July : " Siro,-Yonr rMajesty is awrare that our asternfifrontieris completely defelceleis pThis state of things * always, Psejudicial to us, ant publio opinion severely- reproahed the Government with neglecting, to provide against-danger on that side, At the same time that consiaderable- -snms of money were expended on otlier points that are stronger- by nature and less exposed.

ImORs 1B.slTTllFY 0! .PPr AT. l Onme of the motions in this cause, was reported in IVic WErnez of the Ilth inst. Mr. OAnlss and Mr. TO== movedI on behalf.of the dlefenidants, Bewicke and Cruster, t-o discharge an order of the Vice-Chancellor Woodfor their crosg-6xamination UPon1 an affidavit filed by thema as- to documents in their possession. The answer had been -ut, in, hut the cause -was not at-iss'ue. The order of the \'xoe-Chancellor had been made uapon the authority of the decision of the loords Justices, in "1Kaye vSmitb1 afmnan order of the Master cf the Itolls, reported in vol. 20 ot Beaonn's Reports, -p. 566; In support of the mnotion it -was contended that the affidavit in question wras not an affidavit 'within the meaning, -of the 40th section of the 15th anid 16th Victoria, chap. 86 (the Chancery Amendment Act)- "to be used, or -which shall be used, on any claim, motion, petition, or other proceeding before the Court," the application 'for production of documents not being a "proceeding" b e-fore the Court; that under the. old practice the oath of the defendanit in his answer as to documents was held to be conclusive if the answer were sufficient, lint that ifthe present order -were to.be sustained it would render answers wholly unnecessary, inasmuch as a plaintiff mnight, as soon as he had filed his bill and the defendant had apae,compel bins to make such an affidavit as' that under cnsideration, and then. cross:examnine hiM as to all the matters either in issue or not in issue iaxthe caus-e, The same thing could nzot he done by the plaintiff, inasmuch as by the 20th section of the act an order for production of documents by the plaintiff couldl not be obtained in a tuit instituted by bill unitil the dofendant had fauly answered., The decision in "K layo v. Smith" -was distinguishable from this case, and no such broad proposition was there laid down as that upon evesy affidavit maade by a party to a suit there was a hiability tocross-examination. Mr-. Roxauscen and M-r. L. -WEnnB in support of the order, contended that the decision in. "Kayo v. Smith" went to the full -extent of the order, -now under appe4l and was strictly within thie letter as 'well as the spirit of the 40th section of the act. The object of the v-izn rose examination and cross-examnination permitted-by the act was the aiscertainment of the truth, and therefore it was that that section was -without limit as. to parties or the nature of thLe affidavit to be used. That this was an.- affidavit "1tots used"' in support of the defendant's right to protect any document of which he objected to the production. An a. plication for production was strictly a "proceeding" in tae cause, and, although made at chambers, was as mruch a proceeding before the Court asif actually3made incourt. Asesuming thatan order similar to the order inquestion tohave the possible effect, where the defendTant had not answered, of rendering an answer unnecessary, it -wouldI he -a boon to the suit;or;, both plaintiff and defendant, for the one would obtaIn better discovery- tint roce than- upon the written interrogatories, antd the ether be relieved from that which was frequently tediouas and lab)orious--yi, putting in atechnically sufficientaniswer; The Court would' not, it was hopd, put such a narrow construction on this section of the act (an act passed for the relief and benefit of the suitors) as would have the effect of abridging the right to viz-c roce examination, which was one of the greatest advantages conferred by the statute in question. Lord JuStice KNIGHT BRuca-Suichan intention or iejil cannot well he ascribed to uLs, for I believe we have had more -fist: tocs examinations in- this court than in all the other branches of the Court of Chnery put together.- Mnr RoxmRnuHs said this wascetainly so, and that the suitors were deeply indebted to their Lordships in that re~ spect, as by it great delay and expense hadl been saved to themi, tending als to the more perfect attainment of s-nhstantial justice, and be trusted their Lordships would take no s'tep in a retrograde direction, but affirm the order of the Vice-Chancellor. Mrl. ToLasER having replied, Their Loseusmns ordered the matter to stand for judgment this day. Lord Juastice KNTOnT BRuc.E said that~ the Vice-Chan. cedor had considered it incumbent on him to make the order under appeal, whether in conformity or not with his own opinion, on the authority of the repoIrte case of "Kaye v,. Smith," and he thought that the VIce-Chancellor had properly so considered, if that cs.se -was such as he tookcit to c6e. His Lordship, however, was not, sur that that case wa peiely as represented, but, if it was, lie was of opinion trhat lboth the Master of the Rolls and this Court -were in error, and that their decimon wan not sanctioned by the 40th section of the Chancery Ameandment Act or by the practice of the Court. Thin motion ought, therefore, to surcced. In this opinon be did not substantially differfrom the diew taken by the VFice-Chancaller, though e sibly he did from what was done by this Court i1i "-aye -v Smith." Hoerepeated that the -affdavit in this case-was not mnade to be used, andI was not usedi in any "1motion,s claim, or other proceeding" within the meaning of the 40th section of -the act, so as to render the defendant liable to cross-examination. Lord Justice Tuines said that, tie defendant having made an affidavit as to the documents in his possession, the plaintiff obtained an order to cross-examine himu-pon it, and the plaintiff mnoved to discharge that order. He wras of opinion that the order ought to be discharged. It depended upon the 40th eection of the Chancery Amendment. Act. Under the old practice no such question could arise. The words of the section were such as his Lordship rend. In that port of the section which referred to affidavits made by 'parties to the suit -'the power -was- giveni to cross-examine the parties "using" the affidavit. But an affidlavit of documents in the possession of the defendant ,was not made tobheused by the defendant, but against-him. The defendant, it was truie, might give notice to -use it, and then he would ha subject to cross-examination on it, not till then. His lordship was also of opinion that conve- nience was in favour of this interpretation of the 'section.- The Vice-Chancellor mnight have been misled by the case of "1Kaye-v. Smith." In that case he did net mean to allow the defendant to he cross-examined generally, but only asto the documents stated in the affidavit t-o be in his possession, for the defendant had been already cross-examinedl genraly fr fve ay; ht, f te dcisonwas to a contrary effct,hethooh th Mate ofth Rolsand this Court werewrug. t ws sid hatthepratic wa todraw up - genralters. f o, ethugh th aonerth form was

V: (Before thC AAMsr of fh,u PWAT.s_ l HLis ooiOOU gave judgment in this ase, -the articular of which were reported in 7'te Times last weel, and are briefly as follows :-Thie plaintiffs are five persons -who were enrbaser of family graves in the burial;ground. attacbed-to nham-court-road Chapel, otherwise -knowni as Whitfield's Chapel. Under the 15th and 16th Victoria, o. 85, this burial-ground was ordered to be cldsed, and no mnore inteTments to be made in it. The defendants, who represent the trustees of the property, have lately had the chapjel newly painted and repaired, and the burial-ground put in order. One of the improvements in the burial-ground consisted in removing the tombstones and converting them into a general pavement, by means of which a handsome courtyard was thrown round the chapel, ind to foriii which tlhe monumental records of the plaintiffs ancestors iLregularly contributed, vith their faces upward. To this the plaintiffs, notunnaturally, objected, andthe objectof the motion was to obtain an interlocutory injunction to restrain the defendants from any further interfering with. the tombstones or thdir inscriptions. This injunction, so far as the plaintis five respective family graves were concerned, his Honour now granted, but at the same time reiommended the parties to come to some arrangement before the case came on for bearing, inasmuch as there was evidently no desire on the part of the trustees indecently to molest the graverand the decaying ancestors of the plaintiffs would suffer no real innury by being so decently paved down as the trustees of the Tottenham-coubnroad chapels appeared to he paving them. VitlTespect to the 15th and 16th of Victoria, c. g-, it could not be said that this statute so. entirely closed the graveyard as to preclude the plaintiffis from all,cbance of making use of their family graves, inasmuch as the 6th clause distinctly gave a power to the Secretary of State to grant permission in certain cascs for family graves, to be made use of, notwithstanding the burialÃ¯Â¿Â½ound in which the graves were had' been closed nnder the powvers of the act.

'This bill was fied for the specific performance of an alleged agreement to allot certain I -ds(now built over) originally known as Sidney-hall Farms,, atOCoppenhall, aiear-' Crewe, in Cheshire, under these circunmstances --The bill stated that in November, ISM3, Joseh Stokes, the plaintiff's father, and George Lindgop, James Bland, Benjaunin Cotton, Johun Yoxall, Michael Warren, William Brotherton, Adam Mayworthi, and John Ford, all of Crewe, and defendints in this suit, verbally enteredl into a mutual agreement to pnr~ cha.se the above premssa s aseulation, to be divided into 10 shares, of which Stoks was to-r take two, and contribute acco-rdingly ; and that a contract in writing was enterec4 into to purchase the farm, when Stokes paid COI. and the defendaints 30!. esach.

An arbitration was then ap. ~pointcd -with reference t-o the Iota- in question, at which the -plaintiff attended, and totally object-ed to it, when the de;iendants declared that if lhedid-not agreelheshouald forfeit 'the 601. and allU articipation in the farm, completed 'that -purchase, and allotted the landaumong-themsnelves, and. refusedto give up possession of the fourlos reuig opo duce any written agreement signed by the plaintiff's fathes and this bill prayed that the allotment or division bet-weei Stokes and the defendants maight' be declared binding, and that the' four lots miight beconveyedm to hira on payrnenit, of 'the purchase-nioney, or, in the alternative, that the 600. .might be repaid.

This was a demurrer to a bill for specific performance by the vendor of certain property at Cbmarminster, in the cou-nty of Dorset, contracted to be sold to, the visitors of the County Asylum for Pauper Lunatics.. The bill stated a memorandum of agreement dated the 17th of January. 1855, by which the plaintiff,1 "so far as hie lawfully could -and mnight," contracted to sell the propertyin question to the Rev. James Acland Templer, one of the visitors of the Dorset County Lunatic Asylum, for and on behalf of 'himself and all others the visitors of the said asylum. It was further agreed that in case the provisionas of t-he Landis Clauses Act (184-5) were not applicable, or insufficient to enable the contracting parties to perfect the sale, the plaintiff should, at tecost of the visitors, join and concur with t enm in. taking assyproceedings necessary to obtain either an act, of Parliament or suech other power or authnority as might be renluisite to eniable the plaintiff to convey the property, fr-eeea and dischage from all estates for life, or estates-tail, uses, trusts, littons, and encumbrances what6Qoever, unto and to the use of the visitors and their successors. It was also provided that, in the event of ita being found that the plaintiff had no power or aut-hority to carry the agreemnent into effect, it should be and become null and void. Th2e contract was reported by the comn,ittee of vtisitors of the asylmun to the Quarter Sessions, and approved by the Court. it was subsequently submitted to the Commiissioners in Lunacy, and by them reported thereon to Sir Georae Grey, who signified his aipproval onthe 31st ofMarch, 185D5. The bill further stated that the plaintiff, subject to a lease for a term expiring in 1859, was tenant for life in possession of the landIs conmprised in the contrat under the will of his uncle, -which containedt a proviso that, in cse ny f th teant forlif inpossession should as- sigmn orcag thers life etaten, ord atempv rareeot o ortabecom e lrsopt. sor tasse th &eeftoC aysatt.o tuhe relieto iandlprenta, sorudo asuer any otle sactdwhereby ecome vsteud bneortbehel go takueandibtu for some-other of the person next in remainaer under 'thedvs,i h same manner as if the person respectiveywoestewa thereinhefore directed to ceaise was actal ed h visitors had, inL the autiumn of 1855,enrditoa'gotiations for the purchaxe -of otherlad fo thi asylum, and had applied to Sir George Grey for the purpose of obtaining his consent to a reease of the contract entered into with the plaintiff, to whom ai~plication wvas also made for a release.

Mr. Macanlay, Q.C., Mr. Serjeant Hayes, and Mr. Field were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. eltlor, Q C., and Mr. W. H. Adams for the defencant. I' appeared that on the evening of the 18th of Febrnary last, it beinn market-day, a considerable number of persons awere assemb'ied in the Crown Inn, at Hinckleyd drinkng and taLking. &Among the rest the defendant, a sier, tookv part in a discussion, ivhich arose upon the question whether the farmers or the hoeleis paid t'ae best waes to their labourers. In the course of thab' discussion' the names of some hosiers at Hinckley were menitioned who - had; made great fortunes, and among others the plaintiff was' named as "a seven thousandpound man,'Cwhereupon, one of the comr y, who was examined as a zwitness, observedthat he (the plaintiff) s an auctioneer as well as a hosier, to which the defendant replied, *' Yes, the Ibstock job for that." Ibstock was a place where there had been' -a sale conducted by the plaintiff as an auctioneer. The wmtness said that he had heard a gooddeal about that, but never heard it explained, and that he had had dealings with the plaintiff and always found him a gentleman; Thereupon the defenadant said that he also spoke of him a s he foundf him, and that he (the plaintiff) was a d-d scanp, rogue: and vagacond. Tnis was the slander of -which the plaintiff complained, and in a short time after they had beenutered his attbrney 'wrote to :the defendant- de, manding a wvritten apology' and the payment _of a certain sum to the County--Infirmalyj' vasatokesofhis -contrition. The defendant, however, on0a subsequentoccas'!on, in the month of March, repeated the sime words with respect to the plaintiff,and had since the action was bronght .pleaded, by way of justification, that on four different oocasions the plaintiff had been guilty of disreputable and dishonest conduct in his business as an auctioneer. No evidence, however, was now offered in support of those charges; hut Mr. MELIo, onbehalf of the defendant, contended that the words were not spoken of the plaintiff in his trade, and, being mere vulgar a1us3 were not actionable at all; or, if actionable, not such as to call for more than merely nominal damages. -- --- , The learnied JUDGE summed up, and the jury found for the plaintiff-Damages, one farthiug. CnOW's Cou=.-(Beforc Chiefj JtzticC JTEvs.) 2IURDER. William Brown, aged 33, a returned convict, was indictel foi the wilful murder of Edward Woodcock, at Melton Mowbray, on the 19th of June last, IL-. Mellor, Q.C., and Mr. Cockle were counsel for the prosecution,; fr. O'Brien defended the prisoner. The circumstances connected with the dreadful tragedy out of which the present prosecution arose have been toa recently before the pubEe to have been forgotten. Earlyon the morning of the 19th of June an old man, Edward Woodcock, who kept the Thorpe Arnold tollDate, near Me-'ton, and his grandchild, a hoy about eight years old, were found barbarously murdered in the tollhouse. The' old man had been shot through the body, and had received - as many as 10 or U dangerous wounds from some sharp in- strument. The carotid artery had been severed, mid that' was tue immediate cause of death. The old man was partly dressed, as if he had got up for the purpose of opening the gate for a traveller; and his body was found near the door. The time of the fatal occurrence was about half-past 2 as a pistol shot had been heard about that time. The little boy was also found with' his throat desperately cut; so that death must have immediately ensued. Two sixpences were left in the old man's pockets, and a watch at the headof the boy's bed; but it did not appear whether there hiAd been any othermoney or valuables in the tollhouse. There were also. foundinthetoDhonsea pistol andatobacco-stopper, andonthe morninig of tho 21st, in a ditch about three miles off, on the. road from 'Melton to Hose, concealed among some weeds, a bundle of clothes was discovered. They consisted of ablacle silk neckerchief, a striped waistcoat, a shirt, corduroy trousers, and a black hat. They were cut and torn and wet, as if a hurried attempt hbd been made to wash tbem ; but there were on the lining of the trousers some spots of blood. The evidence against the prisoner depended in partuaon the identification of thes6 several articles. It appeared that the prisoner was a. native of Scalford, about. three miles from Melton, and that, 'having been transported, he returned there in the latter *"end of 'May. The prisoner's brother, who. was a.. shoemaker, lived iD. the same neighb.urhood, and had lent the prsoner a pair of corduroy trousers, seuilar to those found in the bundle, and wbich were identified among other things by spots of cobblee's wax upon them. Between the prisoner and his brother there had beensoime angry words respectingthe wife of tho latter, and upon that occasion the. prisoner had brandished a piistol similar to the oae, found in the tollhouse, and also a large knife. The brother's wife gave evideuce as to her belief that the shirt also found in the bundle was' one wliich belonged to her husband, and which she had missed. It appeired fufther that on the 17th and.l 8th of Junetheprisonerhad been making inquiries of several persons respecting old Woodcock, as to who lived with him and what his habits were, whether he sat up aU night or went to bed ; and the. d-escrip'ion given of his dress by those persons corresponded with the articles found in the bundle. Itwas also proved that footsteps were traced from witbin a hundred yards of the tollbar to ahovel near to which, on the evening ofilh - 18th, the prisoner had been seen pulling off his shoes. .On the following morning, after the murder had taken place, between 5 and 6 o'clock, the prisoner was met upon the road froin Melton, going towards Stathern Hardy and Nottingham. He was then dressed not in corduroy trousers, as he had been for several days before,-but in daÃ¯Â¿Â½k blue coloured trousers,and he had on a staaw hat,instead ofablack one. It was proved also that\herhad some time beforebeen seen atf Leicester, wearing troters of the same kind as he then hadon. A witness from Nottingham deposed that on the 5th of June he had- seen the psoner in. possession of a tobacco-stopper similar to the one found in the tollhouse. The prisoner was apprehended on the 22d of June, at Weatherby, in Yorkshire. by a constable who recognized him by the description which Wad been given of him, and uipon his apprehension lie at first said that he was William Parker, a Bedford man, that he had. liveed-as a gentleman's servant, and never been out -of the kingdom; 'but subsequently, upon further information being obtained' respecting him, he ackuowledged that his name was Brown, -and that he came from Scalford; but he stated that he had slept at \Tottingbam on Wednesday night. (the lth), and on the-Thursday night at Leeds, and that he 'ad nist a tfamp: on tEe road, to whom he had-given 'a shilling', a pair of' trousers, and a shirt.' Mr. O'BRizvs addressed the jury for the prisoner, and --Vbe learned Judge having summed up, The jury almost immediately returned a verdict of Guilty.'' ''The learned JuDoE at once passed senuenoe of deth in-. forming-the prisoner that the crime- of wrhich'he had been'| fouind guilty was too foul, and the evidence of hhs guilt tooi clear, to justify any ex;tension of muercy-to hib case.

Yior,xxr THu%DERSTOmnwL-RArTLEPOOL, July iS -Yesterday evenin- this town ws visited by one of the most dreadful thunTerstorms which has ever been witnessed in this part of the country-if, indeed, it has ever been eaualled ior violence -during the period- it existed in irny part of the kingdom. The wind during the dayhadblown from abont the south-west, aceompanied during the former part with occasional showers of rin, the atmosphere being unusually close and oppressive, and the sky continuimg very duli during the whole of the day. About 6 o'clock the skE lowered considerably, and hung ailmost like a black p& over the town. A huge flash or lightning, followed immediatelyby an awfully loud clap of thurnder, heralded the approach of the storm, which instantly began to rage with fearful violence. Inmmense flashes of Iightning in quick succession, immediately followed by tbunder which- reEembled the roar of whole parLks of artilery, coutinued for the space of 20 minutes, aecompanied b; L perfect- deluge of rain and hail; many of the halstones'be;ing of large size, and doing not a little damarge in certis esposed- places -where they fell. A singular phenomenon was obseeved during the continuance of the storm. After severl ofthe lightning flashes-or rather simultaneously with themthere appeared small detached portions of the eleetric fluid, which shot up into the air in a manner similar to rockets, and presented an astonishing ap rance. The storm continued to rage with unabated violence immediately over tho town for about ten minutes, when-a slight breeze springing up caried it away for a few minutes, but the wiind nuddtnly chopped roumd and brought it back, when it oontinued-for about 10 minutes longer and then passed away. No one had ever before witnessed so grand, and yet at the same timeso fearful a spectacle, ama seamen who have been in-the tropics declare that for violence they never saw it surpased. Creat fears were entertained that sernous damaso would result from the lihtning, but it fortunaely happened that, with the exception of rtriing the tops of some of the larger buildings, inclingng the top stone of the Wesleyrs Chapel. it passed harmlessly over te town.

"M ROYAL AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY'S MBERTIYG AT CHELMSFORD. TRIAL oX ThvT.RM1F1, No <'private view" being allowed even to the Ipesident of the society himself, we cannot yet speak of the character of the respective classes either xn the cattle or implement deparbnents, and confine this day's report to a narrative of what has occurred m tne trial fields. At this meeting, for the first time, the trials are Innited to one or two especial classes of implements -namely, those employed in preparing land for crops, together-with tile-machines, draining-tools, and reapers; so that we have not the usual testings of steam-engines, tihrashing, chaffeutting and crushing machinery, but are allowed to concentrate all or interests upon the operations in the field. The stewa3rds of the implement department are Sir Archibald Macdonald and Mr. Chandos Wren Hos- -yns; and the engineering iidge is Mr. J. V. Gooch, of the Eastern Counties Railway; the judges of plouha, &c., sae Mr. C0. S. Read, of B3randon; Mr. H1.8.Caldwell, of .Hibberston, Brandon* Mr. Thomas ffuskinson, of Efferstone, Southwell, lotts; and Mr. Hawlkn, of Sudbury, Suffolk. The judges of harrows cultivators, clod-crushers, &c., are Messrs. -. 3ephson Rowley, of Rawthorne, Chesterfield, Derbyshire, and John Clarke, of Long Sutton, Lincolnshire. The judges of tile machines, draining tools &c., are MIessrs. J. H. Nalder, of Alverscote, Lechlade, Glocestershire, and W. Chalcroft, of Branshott, near lipbrook. - The" light-land" field is close to the show-yard; and adjoining it are 26O-1 acres of rye, on which the reaping-machines are to be tried this day. The " heavy-land" field is at Broomfield, only about a mnile from the showr-yard; and, partly owving to this eonvenient arrangement, g,reatnumbers of people 'have assembled to witness the various interesting experiments. On Friday the judges were inspecting the numerous stands in the yard, and selecting such as they thought rortby of actual trial; and the " general purpose" ploughs opened the practical proceedings by turniag up some good furrovws in the afternoon. . On Saturday morning the heavy-land ploughs were tried,-Ptansome, Howard, Ball, and Busby doing their best, with four strong horses eacl', to break up and turn over furrovws, at first 9 inches, and finally 12 inches deep. The operation was most -difficult, owingto the hardness of the ground, which is rather a strong brick earth than a stiff clay, but abounding with pebbles and flints, over which the ploughs jumped in their work. Aconsiderable number of harrows, broad-shearers, .cultivators, and rollers were also put through their performances, the chief contest with the parers and cultivators being between Bentall and Coleman. Boydell's new locomotive engine, fitted with his " endless railway," was smoking and snorting and gailoping about the light-land field, stepping over 'eminences and across hollows, running across ploughed ridge and furrow, as rwell as on the level, 'and dragging with immense force a ponderous ploughing-machine of Ir. Coleman's. This.imnlemeat has seven ploughs, arranged to advance m a Y form, like a flock of wildfowl, and turn over a land, or stetch; but it was found almost impossible to keepall the tools in work at once, or to regulate 'the depth according to the form. of the ridge. MIr. Boydellhas the credit of endeavouring in spite of difiiculties to solve the steam-culture question by an improvement of one of the earliest suggested notions, and before the trial days are ended the power of an engine to Work a tillage irplement economically while propellingitself over the rugged surface of a field will be thoroughly put to the proof. However, the chief novelty of the present show consists in two rival inventions for steam-ploughing by a stationary engine and windlass, wrireropes, and anchored pulleys. Both methods of working and both sets of apparatus are most ingenious; and now that we have seen common ploughing and also trench ploughing in hard, stony soil 12or 14 inches deep actually done .by steam power, and, apparently, at an economical cost, we may declare the great desideratum at last attained, and hereby invite the curious portion of the public :s woll *l +b, a ricultural and .mechanical world to hasten to Chelmstord aul see for themselves the accomplishment of a difficulty that has baffled innumerable inventors and excited the disbelievingsridicule of farmers for the last half century. Mr. Smith, of Woolston, Buckinglhamshire, has contrived one set of machinery, by which he has made a 7-horse engine plough a hundred acres of land on his own farm, - the working expense having been about7s. per acre, and the quantity of ground turned over four or five acres a-day. ffe does notv work the common plough, - bat performs what is ca-lled "baulk ploughing," combined with subsoil-stirring, and grubbing-all -done by one passage of the implement. And not only has this clever amateur mechanic (a practical 'agriculturist) constnrcted novel implements, but he has also introduced upon khis heavy clay land a new system of cultivation for beans and wheat, in which the labour of preparatory tillage is reduced to a miniunum, the soil maintained clean of couch, and the subsoil openedcheaplyand thoroughly toatmospheric 'enriching Of Mr. Smith's mode of traction we shall have occasion to speak more particularly here'after. A nuimber of ploughs of peculiar construc- tion have also been invented by Mr. Baker, of YWoburn and Mr. Howard, of Bedford, to be drawn - by Mr. Smith's engine and tackle, and of their per- formances we shall give a future report. The other steam-ploughing machinery is that of ; lIr. Fowler, whose steam draining-plough is now working at Romford, verv near the town, and open to the inspection of all who care to see it, this week or next. MIr. Fowler has a set of four common ploughs in a frame, and turns over as many furrows, evenly, well laid, and at fair depth-the quality of the work upon lea groind being all that a good husbandman can desire. Another implement takes two furrows at once, and trench-ploughas two furrows deep. These we shaJl shortly describe, with the arrangement of ropes, anchorages, &c., to-morrow. The public seem disposed to award Mr. Fowler the 5OOg. prize; and if t;he Judges' testing of the' power of the engine, draulght of the ploughs, and estimated worksing expenses, &c., prove favourable, he wrill undoubtedly come off the victor. On M.onday morning Smith's steam-engine commenced cultivating, and Boydell's " megratherium" harnessed its colossd ribs to Fowler's ploughing implement, but these attempts were stopped in order to make way for the light-land ploughs-those of Rinsome, Busby, Bal, H-oward, Fowler, and Fry, - and Bentall, being tried-some beautifully laid work being the result. In the heavy-land field a great number of clodcrushers and scarifiers 'were tried; some consider- able improvements having 'oeen made in the former imDlements I owler's and Smith's steam-ploughs were also at - work, and will be again busy for public inspection this day. The following reaping-machines were tried in the afternoon upon a piece of half-ripe rye, sufficiently heavy to escape the criticism of being selected for its lightness; and, though partially laid and broken, nowhere prostrated at an angle of less than 45 degrees :-Crosnkl' ' Bell's reaper, as exhibited last year; Croaskill's Bell's reaper, with a new delivery, consisting of two endless straps with wood eogs upon them passing from side to side in front of a sloping platform. An improvement also m this machine is a fly-wheel which regulates and improves the entire movement of the working parts; Dray's Hussey's reaper, with tipping platform; Burgess and Rey's Mq',grnick's reaper, with their patent roller platform, which de. livers the corn in beautiful order sideways by screw- -blades upon a number of transverse rollers upon which the cut corn falls; Palmer,s " Union" reaper, made by Dray and Co., which may be said to be a side-delivery added to H-usseXys machine,the platfom consistig of a number of. radiating rollers, two of which arc set in motion by straps, a man raking off as iu Dray's, A new invention, tried on Mlonday with great satisfaction to the judges, is Chambers' wvater dropdrill, manufacturedby Garrett; a great improvement upon the liquid-manure dril, inasmuch as the iquor is al deposited with the seed where wanted, iead of wasted by being poured out in one continuous line. So far the weather has been moat propitious, and, as far as all other external indications are conicerned, everything promises a successful and briliant meetins .

LYCEUM THEA TRE. Yesterday afternoon Mradame Ristori took her benefi, and two new pieces were produced. The first of these was the Francesca da RJimird of Silvio Fellico, who is more celebrated here as the narrator of his own prison-life than as a tragic poet, and whose dramatic fame wiU scarcely be great among us on the strength of this work. Dante's episode of the unhappy lovers, whose fate in the lower worid has been so frequent a theme for pictorial art, derives mnuch of its irresistible charm from the habitual coneiseness of the Florentine, who, scorning every temptation to dilate, tells almost more by his silence than by his utterance. On the other hand, the play suffers from the author's ecessity of turning a sbort story into a long one. The surprise of Francesca and [aolo by the man who is husband to the formner and brother to the latter, just as the perasal of the tale of " Lancelot and Genevra" has prompted them to a manifestation of gilty love, is an incident, in itself, utterly incapable of expansion, and Silvio Pelico, by plunging into the Isnferno finds hinself in a strait sinilar to that of the author of Pia di Tooontei when he dips into the " Purgatorio." First Francesca adopts the old expedient of seeming to hate her husband's brother, that she may thus avoid his presence. Then an unlucky chance throws her and Paolo together, and an avowal of mutual love takes place, which soon leads to a discovery, on the part of the husband, of the real state of his wile's affections. An altercation naturally ensues between the brothers, who, to l;ighten the pathos of the situation, have been represented as perfect models of fraternal affection. At last through the inflaence of Francesca's father, Guido, a happy settlement of anl differences seems likely to take place, and the wife is just expressing a desire to be reconciled with her reaily fond husband, when the unlucky sinner Paolo again thrusts himself in the way. Another suspicious interview takes place, and on the appearance of the husband a scuffe arises, in the course of which Francesca and Paolo both receive mortal wounds. For the sate of propriety, we are happy to record that the guilt insinuated by Dante is never perpetrated, and that the celebrated "reading' which elicited the expression "Galeottofu il libro" is referred to as something that occurred a long while ago, without any very practical result; bht, at the same time, we must declare our opinion thatthisgeneialsofteningdownof all the d2smaeisperesouincludingthe extremeamiabilityof the husband-thoroughly destroys the character of the old story, and makes it as little Dantesque as the libretto of an ordinarj- opera seria. Had. the ghost of the stern, granite-faced Ghibelline sat in the stalls yesterday afternoon, and been informed that the action taking place before his eyes referred to the fate of that Francesca da Rimini -whom he immortalized by his awful tera rime, he would have looked anxiously round for his old guide and interpreter Virgil, aud meekly asked him to account for a transformation so extraordinary. These remarks belong exclusively to the tragedy-not at all to ths interpretation of Madame Ristor. If anything would have made the Francesca of Pellico look like the Francesca of Dante, it would have been the impersonation of that gifted lady. Those features, which have been so often used for the expression of the fiercer and sterner passions, are as completely subdued into that look of meek sublime sufferingthatbelongstotnevictim rather of adverse fate than of instinctive wickedness, and, if we abstract from the action, and regard the figumre only, we may fancy ourselves in the presence of that most interesting of the frail whose punishment in the place of endless torment was tempered by the perpetual companionship of the object of her love. Neither the character (as drawn by Pellico), nor the situation in which it is developed, admit of that minute analysis which we have bestowed on most of the parts that form the repertory of hladame Ristori ; but one passage deserves especial mention on account of its surpassing excellence and XSa Aissimilarity in kind from anything hitherto attempted by the actress. This is m P-so of dumb show -(Madame Ristori does more with her looks than the poet with his words)-while she listens to the first declaration of love fromthelips of Paolo. Thegrowing delightwithwhich, to her surprise, she finds that her concealed passion is returned, coupled vith a sense that what she is hearing is unfit for virtuous ears, is expressed with an intensity of trth that no power of description could convey to the mind of a reader. The second piece, entitled I Gclosi .Fosunati, is one of those conversational trifles which seem the natural growth of the French stage; but, nevertheless, and notwithstandinc the GalUie name of the author, hL Giraud, we believe it is an original Italian production. A husband and wife (more especially the latter) are jealous of each other without cause, and anxious to conceal the mnpleasant emotion. There is the whole plot; but the nicety with which Madame Ristori balances her feelings, and the unconstrained joyousness which she displays when the cause of uneasiness is removed, place her in quite a new light. She seems to forget the tragedian and to delight in the buoyancy of a Joyons girl Neverwere anl audience more taken by surprise than by the unsophisticated heartiness with which the young wife throws her arms round the neck of her husband anfd fairly whirls him round in the transport of playful
OLYMPIC THEATRE. If the whole human race were suddenly deprived of the power of wrting maock tragedy, so that the art of burlesquing became classed with those obsolete processes that were peculiar to the ancient inhabitants of Egypt and of ehina, there would be no great cause for lamentation. The present age is by no means too ideal; and as soon as a poetical thought begins to show itself above the horizon, it is surely a work of supererogation to begin encumbering it with weights of facetiousness that drag it down into the mud of Cockney existence. Therefore, although the mcdei produced last night at the Olympic is written with a sparkle which entitles Mr. Robert Brough, its author, to be ranked among the first wits who labour for the theatres, and although, moreover, it is put upon the stage with consummate taste, we should be inclined to include it in the universal wail, were it not for one single circumstance-the circum. stance that this particular theatre is in possession of an artist who has invented a school of acting totaly distinct from anything with which we have been familiar, and who, when he acts in pieces written in the grotesque style, does not so much burlesque tragedy as tragedize burlesque. His representation of the terrible heroine of Colchis is a great creation, to be compared with those choruses of Aristophares that, introduced into the midst of all sorts of comic extravagance, and themselves partaking of the atmosphere by which they are surrounded, still betray the genuine poet. Many persons will be saying to-morrow that he isremarkablyfelicitousinimitating Madame Ristori Nothing of the kind. His imitations are confined to a few extern gesEculations, which 20 inferior artists could do as well as he. We would even say that, as an imitation of Madame Ristori, his performance is an utter failure. What he does is to sympathize with the character he undertakes, Iust as Madame Histori enters into the character written by M. Legouv6, and to develope it from his own resources. He would create a parallel to the great original, and it is the essential property of parallels that they have no tendency to meet. The simile of th Ã¯Â¿Â½cat with the mouse which he would place side by side with.the leopard of the Italian is-aq&lienne, is the very sablimity of spite, and the action with which he signifies the popping of the small anima7. into his mouth is a leap into the ridiculous that is in itself sublime from its audacity. The dark, lowering look with which he surveys his intended victim comprises so mnuch of tragic intensity, with so much that belongs to the moody virapo of low life, that it leaves you in doubt whether you ougt to laugh or to shudder, but the burst of feeling with which he calls down a blessing on the head of Creusa, when he thinks that he has murdered her, and suddenly discovers that she has protected the children, as a touch of genuneu, heart-rending pathos thast oughEt to excite tears rather than smiles. While maturing her plans of vengeance, Mredea sings a ridiculous song and dances a grotesque dance, and here, if anywhere, a temptation offered to drop into common ueaning burlesque. But even here the tragic sense of Mr. Bobson was triumphant. His gesticulations, odd as they were, seemed prompted by frantic rage; aud the figure, though a caricature, was stiU terrific. The other characters in the piece were weU played by Miss St. George, Miss Ternan, and Mr. Emery; but the one engrossing personago was the inimitable Robson, who, free from all precedent, could find such strange arabesque shapes for the profoundest conceptions of passion. A graceful compliment was paid to the greatItalian actress at the end of the piece. After an apologetic song by Mr. Robson, the figure of Saturn disappeared and revealed a bust of Mfadamre Ristori standing on a pedestal inscribed with the names of her most celebrated characters. This gave a new stimulus to the loud approbation elicited by the previous part of the performance, escially when it was known that Madame Ris+ori was herself iaPriVate box, and had been among the most conspicuous hughers at a performance that might have been displeasing to a less mgianimous artist. Thus the triumph of the burlesque became a sort of ovation to Mfadame Ristori.

MONAXY vAmTwa AU extremeiy well-conducted Limerick paper (the Observer) very justly remarks,- " We cannot deprecate too strongly the mnanner in which this shocking affair has been treated by the greater portion of the press when commenting upon it. By some it. has been represented as a religious fray-an attack by armed Catholics upon their inoffensive Protestant neighbours, It has been satisfactorily established that thero was not one single faint scintilla of truth in that atrocions misstatement. By others it has besn used to cover an attack upon the troops of the line for themurderous andwanton use of their weapons. That charg,e, we are also assured, is perfectly groundless. By others it has boeen made the subject of a horrible and revolting jest- the foundation for a most hideous jokce; it has been styled ' the battle of the breeches !"' The same authority puts forward the following statement in relation to the origin of the outrage:- " Wewere favoured tbis afternoo lby avisit from a magis trate of Tipperary, Mr. J. S. Dwyer, who was present at the affray and who was wounded by the militia in the leg, two buttons having entered it while he was leading a party of the troops to bringthem upon the rear of the rioters, ThIs gentleman was said to have placed himself at the head of the troops with a small sword in his hand. He showed-us a plain thick stick, vhich he assured us wasthe only weaponhe had with him. He describes the conduct of the troops of the line as cool and forbearing to an astonishing degree, while expsed to a galing fire, and not at all such as to justify a charge of murderous cruelty. ^He promised us a simple narrative of the events, whichl we ho3M to lay before our readers next Tresday. But, really to talkA abouti the conduct of the troops or the violence of the militia is altogether beside the question They were both the results of a firstcause We have bee assured that to every man of the North Tipperary Uilitia there is due at the present moment of the bounty promised them by the Government on their enlistment from 5Os. to 70s. ! They were offered only 6d. each to face the world with on the day of their discharge, and, if theycould manage to return on some day-we believe the 10th of next month-they -were to get 14s. by way of payment in fell of al1 their demrands; and in the meantime they were to be deprived of their good clothes, and tud out in -rags, if theyhad any, and if they had not, then nakedm!

If the men be mistath en and that, in allowances and stoppages, the bounty has been so far reduced that only 14s. remain due to each, why did not their officers go among theo and explain it to themi bstAnd why was not the balance, whatever it might be, paid to them at the moment of their discharge7 WVhy was a stringent and unbending rule applied to the withdrawal from the men of their newv We demal replies tothese questions.they hadIany ether to clothingbe wthoute as iR a Grmanether enre,ltfah ror theirnakedness.

If our militia are not to be treated as well as German mercenaries, let faith at least be kept with them, and if faith have been kep, hut that they do not understand how, let gentlemen descend from their stilts, and condescendgto the eak and iorant capacities of unlette.-ed peasants, by patiently explaining their mistake, and not drive them first to fury, and thern shoot or hang them for their not kmowing better." aord ofunmaLrey, who took a conspicuous anad creditable part in the attemps to suppress the mutiny io tehe first stae, has adtdressed a letter to the iYengls Gtuarditn, with a view of correcting some misstatements of the oeeurrenes which appeba ed isa one of the Dublin journals. dtere is his Lordship't version:- "Aboutm2so'clockyonTesday, after consulting withthe colonel and major of the reaiment, I proceeded, in company withoDr. Bagnell, of that regiment, to theSummerhil- barraCks, for the purpese of ascertaining whether there was a chance of the men returning to their duty before the ival of the military force, which was rapidly approaching. haxstg entered the barrack square, wne wereinme. diatelg surrounded by the men, to whom I pointed out the extreme folly and guitlt of continuing in such a course of violence and mutiny, and that it was lamentabole that a regiment whoce conduct up to that time had been so exemplary should forget their character by such proceed. ings; that,ewith aviewto their owniwelfare aswellasto that of the community, Ino trmated them to abandon such a course, and to return to their duty. My efforts were most swarmy seconded by Dr. Bagnell, and by the quartermaster. sergeant and other sergeants, who dil that men could do, by persuaston and advice, to induce the men to return to thir duty. At length their efforts w ere partially successfui , aud a good many expressed their readiness to do so, and. as a sign of their intention, discharged their iirelocks in the air.

They then called ort, 'Let the offcers come uptors.' 'No,' said I, 'you had netter send asmnall number of men down to the gaol to inform the Colonel, in the name of the others, that you are ready to return to your duty.' This is explessed by your informant thus-' lIe advised the men to come to the gaol, until tht Colonel would sneakto them, as b e would not come out at present.' clostoig themy opinioun, eould have been mher injudicious than for the officers to present themselves until it was evident that there was a fair prospect of their obtainine obedience. Against ray wish, but quite beyond our control, the whole--a greater part of the men-instead of the detachment I had advised, followed us on our return to the gaoL The men were drawn up by the sergeants near the gaol, and I went on to the gaol to relate what had occurred to the Colonel, and there fornd the Adjutant-General, who had aaved from Limerick. While we werettalkig of what had just occurred, a message came to the gaol to say that news had been brought by a woman that the troops were close to the town, and that all the militiamen had immedi. ately run off to their barracks. Thus what bore up to that moment a saromisin, appearance turned outs faiure, Another expression in the report, that 'I promised to see them justified,' s too absurd to require a remark." wThe followi-ng additional particulars, supplied by the Xen~Ah (1-ucr-dicss, describe the state of affairs up to post hour on Saturday evenigrmr:- " The eonstablary have beern engagmed since Wednesday in searching the town and vicinity for missig efrearms.

" The remains of Gibbons, the pensioner, were bauied in the churchyard ouWednesdayeveninlg, shortlyafter the conelusion of the inqu est. Yesterday morning, at a very early hour, the bodies of the two militiamen were privately interredin the graveyard at the rear of the Roman Cathrolie ChapeL They were buried without the usual observance in cases of soldiers vwho die in Her MIajestyr's senrvice, and were [ treated in all resoects as rebels to the Queen. Private |Curley, of the 4ist RegimAent, was this day buried in !the same place with due militaryhonours. TPhe funeral was attended by the troops, comprising the detachments at present in town from Templemore, and several respectable inhabitants accompamed the body to the graveyard. Lieutenant-Colonel Hart took occasion to addres the people assembled. He said he trusted the inhabitants of Nenagh would resuect the grave of a soldier who' did honour to himself and his country, in gallantly assisting to uphold the glory of the nation against its enemies in the Crimea. The man whom they were then interring was shot by the hand of a datardly assassin from behind a door. The troops iinder his (Colonel Hart?s) command entered the town with their muskets unloaded, and remained so for upwards of three long houss; and it was not till after one soldier had been severely woundedand the deceased man mortally injured that 12 men received orders to load aud clear the wal of the men who had been firing from it. NTotwithstanding this provocation, there was not a shot fired by the soldiers till a volley bad been discharged at them, and another of their raen had been shot in the thigh and Eeverely wounded. After storming the baracks there was not a single shot fired by them, and the greatest coolness and forbearance I were oberved by the men. The soldiers thenL searchj2d the fieldsinth rear of the houses, when several of the mnutine&rs were made prisoners, but he (Colonel lart) did not permit man of them to be shot down, or in any way in- jured.

LIBERALITY ArD BIGOTItY. TO THE Z:DITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Permit me to call your attention to two reports which appear side by side in your paper of to-day. The one is of a dinner at Limerick, at which Lord Carlisle was present, the other of a public meeting of the Society for Irish Church Missions, under the presidency of the Earl of Shaftesbury. At the former the Lordl-Lieutenant, in a speech distin guished for statesmanlike wisdom and Christian charity hailed vith cordial pleasure the presence of the Protestant and Roman Catholic bishops at the same board, and expressed a hope that all sides would feel more disposed to employ that religious zeal which is the glory of the human character in adorning their own faith than in impugning that of their neighbours. This glorious sentiment was received, as it deserved to be, with loud and continued cheering. The joint healths of the Protestant and Roman Catholic bishops were then proposed, for which the latter returned thanks in a generous and hearty speech. He called the Protestant Prelate wise, learned, and most charitable ; he spoke of the wide and fertile field of charity which they might cultivate harmoniously together; he hoped they would emulate each oiher in charity, benevolence, and kindness, and confessed he had a powerful competitor inhis Tenerable friend. He esteemed every man as a person redeemed by the blood of Christ, and therefore not a person for any cleryyman to offer insult to. Now, turn to the very next column of your paper, and see by the sad picture there drawn how the benevolent designs of the Queen's Government are thwarted and overthrown by the hostile and aggressive attacks of men who profess to be serving under the banners of the Pince of Peace. The secretary of the Mission Society told of school children waylaid and beaten sometimes so as to endanger life, and of missionaries mobbed and stoned in the streets. Why will not Exeter-hall leave Ireland alone? Why will not these agitators at least let Lord Carlisle's system have a fair trial instead of throwing a torch of discord among a naturally indanmamle people 1 Let the ministers of both faiths work earnestly side by side, and see which will best increase the happiness and gain the affections of the people, and (if I may be permitted to make such a suggestion) let the Government here discourage and oppose by every means in their power that dangerous party whose bigotry is totally inconsistent with freedom of thought and with the principles of a liberal and enlightened policy.

REnronT ox 1 RiSE PnssoccS.-A blue-book of 300 pages contains the 34th report of the Inspectors-General on the general state of prisons in Ireland during the year 1555. The report bears testimony to the gratifying fact that crime, which reached its climan in 1850, has been steadily decreasing ever since, and is rapidly returning to the position in which it stood in 1846, the year latterly taken as the standard of measurement in conseouence of its melancholy notoriety as the irt year of dearth. The number of prisoners immured m gaol on NSew Year's-day last amounted to 3,561, against 5,080 on the Ist of Tanuary, 1855, and the total number of risoners incarcerated during the year 1855 amounted to o,531, against 73, 733 in 1854, 83,805 in 1So3, 9Z638 in 1852, 113,554 in ISo1, and 115,871 in 1850. The daily average has fallen from 11,496 to 4,4183. NTinetyeight deaths of prisoners occurred in 1855, wainst 103 in. 1854. The decrease in the number ofprisoners confined in county gaols is very remarkable. It is shown that in six county gaols the daily average for the last fivo years has fallen belowv that for the seven years ending with 1846, and that in many others a similar result is fast approaching. Dablin and Antrim here appear for the first time among the counties wherein a decrease in the daily average has occurred. It is not only in amount that that improvement is observable in 1reland, for, independently of the great reduction in the number of graver crimes indicated by the tables, the daily average of 1855 as compared with 1846 (being respectively 4,418 and 5,470) condusively proves that the great majority of the committals for the last year must have been for trifling offences, and that therefore in the character, as well as in the amount of crime, a great and most favourable change has taken place. The decrease of crime in Antrim proves the efficacy of the separate system, for there alone has it been in operation a sufficient length of time to afford a just estimate of its efficiency. Its success at Belfast it is hoped may induce the gradual adoption of the system throughout the gaols of the country. The total of committals in 1855, as compared with 1854, shows a de crease of 11,999-viz., 7,539 males and 4,460 females, equal tol981 percent. Thedecrease er cet. in male committals is 22'05, and in females only 16 99. The committals have declined under every head except " revenue laws' and offences tried by courts-martial. This increase is to be ac. counted for by the additional duty on spirits last year imposed and by the embodiment of the miihtia. The lamentable increase in the number of female criminals-noticed by all the inspectors of prisonsintheu-aitedkingdom-urgently calls for the application to this sex of the deterrent and reformatoryaction which is producing such desirable effects upon the other. The separate system is the means most likellytoinsurethedesiredresult. 299 mLles and 170females were sentenced to death (only 2), transportation, and penal servitude, arid 20,255 males, with 18,240 females, to various terms of imprisonment, from 24 hours up to three years. Of the persons committed for crime in 1855, 346 males and 188 females were aged 10 years and under, 5,295 males and 1,259 females between 11 and 16 years; 3,923 males and 3,225 females between 17 and 20, 8,765 males and 10,142 females between 21 and 30, 4,080 males and 3,623 females between 31 and 40, and 4,171 males and 3,330 fe. males upwards of 40 years of age. 7,9D7 males and 3,249 females could read and write, while 10,649 males snd 11466 females were utterly illiterate. Among the criminals the Iomanists of course greatly preponderated; these numbered 23,449 males and 19,365 females, while the Protestants only numbered 2,489 males and 2,100 females, and the Presbyterians only 642 males and 302 females. The difficulty of imparting instraction to the ilitesete prisoners is very great, from the shortness of the terms of imprisonment, and the employment of turnkeys to do the work of the schoolmaster is not calculated to mend the matter. The inspectors earnestly recommend the supercession. of these Literary warders by competent schoolmasters, remunerated by ample salaries. The inspectors advert to tho ordinary bridewells of Leland (118 in number), and animadvert very gravely on the defective arrangements for the accommodation cf prisoners, the want of water, the maperfect drainage, thewant of security, the inadequacy o the prison staff, and the defective inspection. The conduct of the magis. trates, who h;ve almost universally fallen into the error of committing risoners to, and sanctioning their detention in, brie els for long and illegal periods, is also complained of, as a direct violation of the Prisons Act, of whichthe rishGovernmentwoulddowelltotake cognizance. -Sundry suggestions are. made for the correction of this eviL As regardsjuvenile offenders, it appears that there were 7,088 last year against 10, 78 in 1854, and of these 1,376 were recommitted in 1855 and 2,031 in 1854. In the committals the females are 2041 per cent., or 1-5th of the 'whole; and in the recomrmittxls, 24-56 per cent., or l 4th. No juveniles were sentenced to transportation, nor any under 11 years of age to penal servitude. Only 938 males and 286 females were sentenced for longer periods than one month, but 4,044 males and 994 females were under sentences ranging from 24 hoursto one month. 19.92 per cent. could read and write, and 43.12 per cent. were wholly iliterate. In the last general report the question of establishing reformatories was fully discussed. The inspectors for tle present observe, ihat unless youthful criminals can be kept under restraint sufiiently long to enable instruction and reformatiou to take deer root, it is idle to expect much, if any, improvement in this cLasw of the criminal population. E,uxy Ciosmao ASSOCrxrsoN.-Forty-one sermons were reached on Sunday in and around the metropolis, on the religious and socixl advantages that would accrue from a general earlier suspension of business and the adoition of a :saturdy hlf-holyday where Prc aFble. which, i ith 10 on the seie sbject on the previous Sabbath, make together Sipulpit discourses (30 being by clergymenand 21by non-conformist zmiistersi which have been delives.ed within thelast fortnigh on JC5fof tbe Early Closing Aociation.

WaAT Is Ar STxE.-There axe many people in America who talk of a " brnsh." as they call it, with England, as if a war with that Power were mere child's play, while Johm Bull, on his part, threatens to " use us up" in a very summary manner, in case we should provoke h3m to hostilities. But a war is always a very seeous affair, aud between two countries whose interests are so cosely identified as those of England and America it would indeed be most foul and unnaturaL In the year 1S54 the total value of exports from the United States to Great Britain was $140,000,000. We sent them raw cotton alone to the amount of $82,000,000. If this supply was stopped, thousands of operatives would be thrown out of empoyment; and England would fznd her domestic tronbles more serious than her foreign ones. At the same time the United StAtes in 1854 imported of British produoe over $100,000,000. Now, in the face of facts lke these, is it not madness to thinkof war? Every blowthat England struck at us would recoil on herself, and vice tvWr&. -It would be a contest between the right and left arms of the world, and, no matter which was paralyzed, the other would feel it mogt acutely. -PhiZade?ie R f ven,ing fou'na4, June 25.
