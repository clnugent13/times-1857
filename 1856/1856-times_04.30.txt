THE CRIMEAN BO ARD OF INQUIRY. The Board met yesterday at the usual hour'. The attendance of the public, and of the fairer portion especially, was again most numerous. The JUDGE-ADVOCATE opened the proceedings by addressing Lord Cardigan as follows :-It has been officialy communicated to the Board that you are one of those officers who considerthey have reason to coioplain of certain statements or allusions in the report of the commissioners rent out to inquire into the supplies of-the British army in the Crimea, and you have called upon the Secretary of State for War to give you an opportunity of answering those statements. Will you point out to the Board the passages in the repor'v gf which you complain? Lord Cardigan.-I did not apply to the Secretary of State for an inquiry. With the permission of the Board I wil read a statement I have drawn up, in which will appear the paragraph of the report to which I except. The noble Earl then proceeded to read his statement, which commenced with a reference to the Royal warrant constituting the Board, in which it was stated that certain officers had demanded a foll inquiry. He begged to say, so far as he was concerned, he had not demanded any inquiry. Upon the publication of the report hne had addressed a letter to the Secretary of State, with such observations as occurred to him upon a perusal of that report. That letter WaslS aid before Parliament, and he was then content to await with confidened the result of a deliberate consideration of facts; but, it having been deemed necessary to issue a Royal warrant for the present inquiry. he accepted willingly an opportunity of entering more fu-lly into details, and shrank from no investigation of his conduct. The noble Earl then referred to that portion of the commissioners' report in which they spoke of the insufficient supplies of forage, and said,- 9When the supply began to fail, the commissariat officer referred to, whio appears to have done everything in his powver to meet the difficulties of the case, proposed-as he knew there was plenty of barley at Balaklava-that if ;s detachment of the horses were allowed to go down dai-, lie would engage to bring up enough for the rest of the brigade. This proposition anpearS to have been brought snecially under the notice of Lord Cardigan by LieuteCaalryt,olonel Mayou, Assistant Qua^rtermaster-G:eneral of Cavalry, who sta^.tes tha^;t his Lordship declined to accede to it, as lie had previously done whlenl a simil- proposition was made to huin to sendthe horses down for liay before that supply failed." The noble Earl, upon this paragraph, observedthatthe commissioners had declned to express any opinion as to the policy or impolicy of his refusal, and they were equally unwilling to enter upon the military reasons which led to the detention of the light Cavalry in the position they then occupied; but the charge conveyed by the paragraph he had quoted appeared to be that he had contributed to the subsequent inefficiency of the Light Cavalry Brigade by his refusal to adopt the suggestion to send down the horses to Balaklava for forage. A reference to the evidence given before the Committee of the House of Comnmons would convince the Boardthat in not adopting that suggestion he had exercised a sound and necessary (dicretion, and tookthe best course to effect his only object, to maintain as much as possible the efficiency of the Light Brigade. Being desirous of confining his observations to his own vindication, but, at the same time, being anxious not to evade any responsibility fairly belonging to himself, he would briefly yive a history of his connexion with the Light Cavalry in t'le East. Ee landed and joined the 17th Lancers and part of. the Sth HuEsars at Scutari. on the 23d of May, 15a, proceeded to Varna on the 3d of June, and two days afterwards went on to Devno, where he remained three weeks, and then, in accordance with an order from Lord Raglan, proceeded with 200 cavalrv and some Turkish troops upon a reconnaissance, which occupied 17 days. He returned on the 11th of July, and the brigade shortly afterwards moved to Yanibazar. During thetime of the sickness in Bulgaria the Light Brigade was exceedingly forttunate, losing from cholera only about 10 men, and General Cannon, Colonel Wetherall, Adjutant-General, and Colonel Steel, Military Secretary to Lord Raglan, could testify to the efficient condition of the horses at that time. On the 14th of September they disenibarked at Old Fort, Li the Crimea, and the Light Brigade, accompanied by a small force of infantry and artillery, were immediately sent in search of some Russian cavalry supposed to be in the neighbourhood. On the 2Cth they arrived at the Alma, and about the 25thl reached Balalhava, at the entrance of which town they first encamped, but soon after moved up to the heights above Sebastopol. During the period the Light Cavalry occupied those positions they were sufficiently provided with corn by the commissariat, and the locad supplies of hay were not then exhausted. They afterwards moved back to the old position near Balaklava, and remained there until after the battle of October 25. After that battle, in which the Light Brigade had 393 horses put hors (le com;at, they removed to a position four miles further, and near to Inkerrann and the camp of the Second Division. It wa stationed there at the period of the battle of Inkermanu lip to that time the forage had reached them in tolerabl: sufficiency, but, upon their removal to the more advance I heighlts, the supplies became more deficient, from the greater distance fromu the depots and the difficulty of transport. He would mention thatthe Committee of theHouseof Comosons, which had examinedmany witnesses who had held high cornmandintlhe Crimeapossessed an advantage ovez the cousnissioners in having been at liberty to consider themilitaryreasons, some of which he would again mention. Shortly after the arrival of the brigade on the heights General Canrobert pointed out to him the importance of thepresence of cavalry at that position, in order to _uard aqainst a sudden attack of the Russians from thme valley n the rear. Ipon his (Lord Cardigan's) suggesting to Lord Raglanthe severity of the exposure and other difficulties, which almost rendered it impossible for the brigade to remain in that position, he gathered from Lord Raglan's rely that he was privately pledged to the French General to keep the cavalry there. Lord Lucan, the General of the division, in his evidence before the Sebastopol Committee, had statei that he drew the attention of the Quartermaster-General to the impossibility of the Light Brigade being foraged in that position, and General Airey had told the commissioners that the Light Cavalry wrere kept on the heights of Inkermann by order of Lord Raglan, after conferenco with General Canrobert. Thus the Board would see that the retention of that position by the Light Brigade was a remlt of the exigencies of the service and by order of the superior authorities, over which he had no control. That position entailed great sufferings upon the brigade, and those sufferings were increased by the distance (seven miles) from the depots at Balaldava. Even before the storm of the 14th of November the pawer of transport was not sufficient to keep the brigade wholly supplied, and after the storm the difficulties were greatly increased. Mr. Assistant-Commissary-General Crookshank, who was attached to the Light Cavalry Brigade, )Ir. Filder, andCaptain Shakespeare, of theRoyalArtillery, before the Sebastopol committee proved the immense laboutr of getting suDplies from Balaldava, and the frightful state of the roads.E He (Lord Cardigan) had now shown that the Ltght Brigade was greatly affected by the severity of the season, by the exposed position, by its distance from the depots, and by the dimintished means of those whos3 bnsiness it was to supply it after the storm. He would now proceed to state the steps he took upon the occasion. On the 16th of November he requested the commanding offic3rs of regiments to report to him officially any deficiencie which existed. None of those-reports exhibited any insufficiency of supplies, but only some arrears, which Mr. CrookshanL-, t ie commissariat officer, hoped speedily to make up, -an expectation which was not fulfilled. On the 20th, Colonel Mlayou, the brigade-major, rep,ortd that there had been a supply of barley, not quite the fuil quantity, but no hay; tho same on the 21st and 22d. Those returns showed that up to that date the horses ob. tained, if not full supplies, at least sufficient food to sapport them, provided they were not subjected to any undue extra labours. If Colonel Mayou's reports were correct, i there was an inaccuracy in Colonel Douglas evidence, as uouoted by the commissioners, " that for about a fortnight after the 14th of November the horses were without hay or straw, and had only on an average about 211b. of barley per day." He conceived there had been a midtake in using the words "that for," and that the sentence should have begun "A%bout a fortnight after," &c., which would bfing up the date to about the 23d - and he was obliged to resign the command on the 29th. buring the interval betweea the 23d of November and the 3d of December, when the brigade moved nearer to Balaklava, the supplies became so insufficient as to cause great losses, which were increased by a want of nosebags; and yet the returns showed that, notwithstanding all those privations, the mortality of horses in the Light Brigade contrasted favourably with that in the Heavy Brigade and the artillery, the losses, according to the commissioners, being in the Heavy Cavalry 47 per cent., the artillery 42 per -cent., and tho Light Brigade 38 per cent., which was also therate of loss among the commlissariat animals, which were, as r. Filder had stated, always fed in preference to other animals. He would next refer to the suggestion which was made to send the Light Cavalry horses to BaLailava, and would draw the attention of the Board to the fart that none of the officers whose evidence was quoted by the commissioners had stated that they had personaly communicated with himself upon the subject, whichi, indeed, they had not done. They no doubt referred to a communication which was made to Colonel 3Mayou by Alr. Crookshank, whose suggestion he (Lord Cardigan) declined to adopt. Nor did those officers state that they attached sufficientimportance to the suggestion to avail themselves of the many opportunities they ejoyed to communicate it to the Lieutenant-General conmunanding the division. The suggestion of Mr. Crookshank was communicated verbally to him (Lord Cardigan) by Colonel Mayoa some days after tho 14th (probably the 16th), and was renewed verbally on the 23d, when the obstacles which prevented its acceptance on the 16th had greatly increased. The storm of the 14th had reduced the roads to such a condition that acceptance of Mr Crookshank's proposal was impossible consistently ,ith the good of the public service. Since he had prepared the foregoing remarks he had received from Lord Panmure a copy of a letter addressed to him by the commissioners, who seemed to thinkthat he (Lord Cardigan) had impugned theirfigures in relation to the Light Brigade and as to the commencementof the seriousdeficiencies of supply. He had not contested the fact, but the date. The commissioners also appeared to believe that lie haddeniedthe statementin their report that a suggestion to send the horses to Balaklava had been made to him. He had alWays admitted it, and could not conceive why the commissioners should be so anxious upon the subject. They also referred to the mortality of horses in Nlovember, 18M, and to his statement to Lord Panmure that the loss was greater in the Reavy tan in the Light Brigade. That statement wa: founded upon the commissioners' own report, but they had now adopted a different calculation, which, however, only caused the difference between 10 per cent. and 12 per cent. The accuracy of their figures had been impugned by others. but ho was no party to that dispute, and would only say, if their first figures were correct, they supported his original statement, and if they wrere incorrect, that fact lessened the value of the report. The commissioners also went into statistics for the mnonth of December, but, as he resigned his command before that time, he should not follow them into that inquiry. He would appeal to the Board whether, such vague assertions, which the commissioner bad power to ceonfinn or to disprove by examining the Lieutenant-, General or himself, they were justified in designating the case of the Light Cavalry as one requring special notice, when, upon their own statements, they could not show a higher average loss over the other brigade than two per cent. in a position of. tenfold difficulty. The commissioners also observed that even if the mortalty in the Light Brigade had been less than in the Heavy Cavalry it would have been no justification for leaving the horses with so inadequate an amount of food if more could have been obtained. To that remark he assented. They also observed that it was strange that many suggestions which -were said to be impossible of acceptance should have been made by ofEcers knowing the amount of labour which the horEes were competent to perform. As to- the many suggestions, heS :had already mentioned the real facts, aud would leave the Board to deide upon them. Returniug to the main question, wih was whether it wonld have been expedient to have sent the horses for forage, even if he had possessed the power to send them, which he did not admit,-but evea if they had been sent, there was no certainty that they would have got any sup plies, as the evidence of Deputy-Cornissary-General Drake, Deputy-A sistant-Commriary-uGezeraI WYebb, and Assistant-Commissiry-General Crookshank would prove. The -noble earl - then referred to the evidence of several witnesses to show the impassable condition of the roads, and appealed to the - Board whetlier it would have been possible' to have sent the LIght Cavalry horses to Balaklava for forage; the animnals being, as the commissioners themselves had said, "previously exhausted by want of hay and straw." He believed, had he done so, it would have caused a greater loss of horses than actually occurred from the deficiency of forage. Military reasons, too, as he had shown, required that the cavalry should be kept in readiness to act, and he would not have been justified in sending away a large portion of the horses and men for a period of 10 or 12 hours upon such a duty. Lord Lucan was aware of the condition of the Light Cavalry, and had stated it before the Sebastopol Committee. If Lord Lucan had thought it expedient to send down the horses, being the superior officer, he had the opportunity of doing so. The condition of the horses was made known to Lord Raglan, who could have exercised his supreme authority. Jlr. Filder, too, in referring to the deficient supplies at the period, had assigned three reasons-the distance, the bad stte of the roads, apd military considerations. He (Lord Cardigan) had deClined to impose that grievous labour upon the Light Brigade, beheving that it would have caused g,reater losses than even the deficient supplies. In the Sebastopol Conunittee a dictZtlZm of the Duke of Wellington had been oted that the extreme limit to which cavalry horses should bo sent for forage was three miles. It might be said that every geperal rule must be governed by special, and subject to exceptional cases. He thought he had shown that, far from the case of the Light Cavalry being one which admitted of expansion to the rule, it was exactly the reverse. That view had been illustrated by the evidence of Lord Lucan, who had stated the effect of such work for 3A miles upon the horses of the HIeavy Brigade. Ee had now stated all the facts which led him to decline acceding to the suggestion of Mr. Crookshank or of recommending it to his superior. He mighthave been induced to notice a statement made by Lord Lucan, but tiouglit it most expedient to leave undiscussed the question hetbor 200 troop horses lout of a brigade of 1,000) which had been engaged upon a long reconnaissance did or did not ehibit marks of their arduous task of marching 300 miles through a desert country. Neither would be dispute the extent of injury which 250 horses (out of a brigade increased to 1,250) sustained from being unfortunately deprived of water when marching through an enemy's country. Upon the facts he bad mentioned he felt justified in demanding from a military court an approval of his conduct and a decision that there was no fouldation for a charge that he had neglected to use every precaution to maintain the efficiency of the brigade-a charge which he ventured to hope was inconsistent with his whole professional career. (Applause.) MIr. Assistant Cohimissary-General Crookshanlk was then called by Lord Cardigan, in answer to whose questions he said he had made a suggestion to Lord Lucan to send down the horses of the Light Brigade to Balaklava for forage, as he had to himself (Lord Cardigan). He beheved he applied several times on the subject to Lord Lucan. He could not remember the exact conversations that took place, Dut the hoses were refused. General BERKELEY, referring to the vwitness's evidenee to the commissioners, ask-ed who were the officers commanding regiments who had -agreed to send down horses to Balaklava for forage. The witness replied it was about the 16th of November, when the roads were not so bad as they subsequently became, that Colonels de Salis, Low, and Douglas, and perhaps others, agreed to send a certain number of horses for forage. In answeT to GeneralPFEL, thewitness said it was at Lord Cardigan's direction that he communicated on the subject with Lord Lucan. The JUDGE-ADVOCATE, on behalf of the Board, asked whether the witness was of opinion that if the commissariat had brought up forage half way, the Light Cavalry could have conveyed it the remaining distrnce. Mr. Crookshauk admitted he had not thought of that arrangement. H{e differed in opinion from Lord Cardigan, but he p resumed the o'dicers commanding the cavalry regiinentsthought theycould have carried forage the whole distance. Before making the suggestion he had communicated with the conimissariat offcer at Balaklava, who had undertaken there should be no serious delay in supplying any parties who should be sent. Lord Cardigan asked how the witness could be certain there w-ould be no delays at Balallava when the evidenca showed parties were delayed many hours, and frequently returned without any forage at all. Thewitnessrepliedthat that evidence referred to Staff officers' forage when each officer sent for his own. Mr. Adams, at Balaklava, had promised to set aside a special landing p lace for the cavalry. Lord Lacan (who was in plain dress), in consequence o' the evidence of Mr. Crook-shank, asked pernission to make a statement in reply. Permicsion having been accorded, lord Lucan referred to Mr. CrooL-sank's statement that he had repeatedly applied to him to send down the Light Cavalry horses for forage, and said he had prescribed for himse a rule never to interfere with the rationing or foraging of any part of his division on a distant station, that responsibility devolving upon the commanding officer, who knew all the circumstances of the place and time. He declared he never was applied to by lr. Crookshankto authorize any horses being sent down, nor had he ever had any co:nmunication upon the subject, except upon two occasions, when Mr. Crookshank objected to the Light Cavalry beinnstationed at Inkermann, in which objection he (LordLucan'i concurred, and invited him to state his reasons to Lord Raglan. Mfr. Crookshank wished distinctly to state that he did apply to Lord Lucan to have the Light Cavalry horses sent down to Balaklava. The JUDGE-ADvoCAE.--Was your communication in writing ? Mr. Crookshank.-No. Verbally. I had repeated communications -with Loid Lucan. It was when the Heavy cavalry was on the coline. I went from our camp at Inkermaun and laid the matter before him,and Iam under the impression that he went to Lord Raglan in consequence. Lord Lucan.-It is perfectly true I went to Lord Raglan to explain the great difficulties about foraging. Mlr. Crookshank met me oa the road, and I told him to put his objections in writing, and on the 18th he wrote me this letter, in which he says, " In obedience to your Lordship's orders I beg to report to you upon the subject of my yesterday's cosmniunication with regard to the foraging of this brigade during the winter." Mr. Crookshank.-Your Lordship should read a little further. "I cannot be afforded any assistance in transport by the brigade." Lord Lucan.-I will read the whole letter. (Letter read.) By theJUDGE-ADvocrTE.-That is the letter I wrote by Lordt Lucan's orders, but it does niot refer to any directions with regard totbe horses. The refusal to send down those horses was a subject of conversation throughout the camp. Lord Lucan.--la that very letter Mr. Crook-shank says " I would commence by bringing to your Lordship's notice that nt this distance from Balaklava I cannot be afforded any assistance in transport by the brigade-I mean regimnents cannot send their horses in for barley, and thus the whole transport devolves on the commissariat." Is that the letter of a man who asks for assistance ? Mr. Crookshank said the application to Lord Lucan for assistance was a verbal one. The Earl of Cardigan would not deny that he made a similar application to him. The JUDGE-ADVOCmR.-Did anybody direct you to make that application to Lord Lucan ? Mr. Crookshank was under the impression that Lord Cardigan recommended hiin to do so. Lord Lacan thought it a very extraordinary proceeding for a Brigadier to make communications with his Divisionia General through a commissariat officer. Lord Cardigan had no recollection of having mnade any such recommendation to Mr. Crooksbank, but he could not thinki it very exrtraordinary if, when the commissary of the brigade came to him, and asked his permission to send down these troop horses,-the application not being a written, formal, official one, but a verbal application-he had replied, "It is impossible for me to give you this pernis- sion; I have not the power to do SO you must apply to the Lieutenant-General commanding the division." When divisional orders were given upon every other subject -connected with the brigade, as would be secnby Colonel Mavou's letters, he wanted to know how the Brigadier-General could be made entirely responsible for all the arrangements of the commissariat with respect to his brigade. He could only say that from the moment of his landing in the Crimea until the day he came away he was never called upon to give any orders whatever to his brigade with regard to the commimsariat, beca,use the whole of those duties had been repeatedly regulated by the divisional officer. In answer to further questions put by the JUDGE-ADVOCATE, fr. Crooksharks stated that on the occasion of his first application for assistance, which was about the 5th or 9th of November, the commissariat had a sufficient number of transport animaLs but when he next applied the transport had become fearfuily reduced. Instead of the GO animals he required, there were only 35 or 40,- and later still the number was reduced to ten. He then, of coiurse, considered it a mnatter of necessity that the horses should go down for their forage. To the best of his recollection, he had never received an answer either to his letter to Lord Lucan, dated Noveniber 18, or to any other letter he had written to hisLordship. The letter of the 15th was, he repeated, written by his Lordship's directions, in order to put on record the facts there mentioned and to express his (witness's) strong objections to the position of the cavalry. Lord Lucan remarked that Mr. Crookshank had not only written to him on the 18th of November, but also three days afterwards. The letter, as published in the evidence,was addressed to theELrl of Cardigan, but that was a mistake. However, there was not one word in that letter resecting an ap lication to him for forage parties for the Ct avalry Vrigpde. fneral RowAy; (to Mr. Crookshank).-Can you account for not havingrecorded in those two letters anythingrespecting-the sending dp'n of the cavalry horses ?.-No, I cannot. I very much regrlet nowY not having made some record of it. The Earl of Cardigan, in reply h the ;JUDGE-ADVOCAT, stated that lie should Certainly not' have -thought -himself justified in detaching any portion of the force under his comnmand without first obtaining the sanction of the Lientenant-General commanding the division. -He had no ot:tlyinig piclcets. Received an order to take up the encamp mnbythe Xmdl , and aferards reeived an order to shift the ground to about 300 or d0 yards off; these order,s were given to him in the usual way through the Assistant:&djutant-General, and were, he had no doubt, puir into divisional orders. TPhere could be no sort of doubt as to the brigade having been posted in that position.by order of Lord Raglan, and he (Lard Cardigan) had understood from n General Canrobert personally tfiat that General considered it a point of great importance to have the Light Cavalry i Brigade at Iuk-ermann. General Scarlett, called and examined by the JuDGE ADVOCATE, stated that pasties -were constantly sent by the 'Heivy Brigade into Balaklava for forage. Those parties Inere very much delayed by the want of boats to bring the forage on~ shore. Sonetimes the men had to go to the -essels and fill the sacks. TRhen the hay was at one side of the hay while the barley was given outfrom the other. Theforaging parties were sometimes detained for four or fire hours, and such was the delay that he was obliged to have fromthe ofiicers who went dowvn in conmand a retrn of the number of hours they were engaged. There was not sufficient strength on the spot to land the barley. Could not be certain whether they ever returned without getting the forage, but his impression was that they had. The men went for forage in this way throughout November, December, and the whole winter. He imagined that to land the stores was not the duty of the transport, but bf the commissariat. Lord Lucan said he had returns which would show that the foraga,ing parties mentioned by General Scarlett were frequently absent seven or eight hours. Lord Cardigan, in reply to a question put by the CounT, " from w hom did the Light Cavaliry Brigade receive their orders at Inkermann 2" said he had received no special instructions for his guidance after arriving in that position. Divsional orders came frequently from the LieutenantGeneral with respect to the hours of turning out, the dress of the men, the wearing their boots outside their overaUs, and so on, but he had no soecial instructions. Lord Lucan said he had been reouested by Lord Raglan not to interfere with the duties of tie Light Brigade. Perhaps he might mention a circumstance that occurred illustrative of this. One morning he received a notce from Sir Colin Campbell that they were threatened with an attack in the rear. Upon this he sent an order to the Light Brigade to approach him, but to move slowly, beciise he had sent to Lord Raglan to ask his authority for the movement. Next day he received an order from Lord Raglan on no account whatever to exercise any authority over the Light Brigade. Lord Cardigan remarked that Lord Raglani'6 order clearly referredenlyto the turning out of thebrigadeinthe event of any real orthreatened attack from the enemy, and did not extend to details connected with the command respecting which a divisional officer would naturaly exercise authority. Replying to further questions from the BOARD, Lord Cardigan said that; as far as his recollection went, he wfas desired, either by Lord ^Raglan personally or by the Quartermaster-General, to encamp the brigade near the Windmill, though not too near. Before he could obtain pemission to move the brigade out of this ground he recollected a question was raised about it at the head-quarters of Lord Raglan, and his lordship expressed a particular desire that the brigade should not be moved far from their' original ground. If he did not mistakie, after consulting General C6nrohert, Lord Raglan wvould not consent to his removing further than 100 yards. Colonci Doherty wnas then called, and examined by the JUDGE-AD VOCATE.-13ad stated in his examination before the commissioners that he made no personal application to be allowed to send the troop horses for forage, because he had leamed from other commanding-officers that they had been refused pernission to do so. He did not heer who had refused permission, but supposed it must either have been the Brigadier or the General commanding the division. Heard no reasons for the refusaL Sendin- down the horses for forage would have been practicable atrs but notafterwards, because the horses were so weak and in such bad condition that they could not have performed the' journey there and back, and have brought forage with them. At least that was his opinion. 3SBight have made the application if he had not heard of the refusal given in other instances. It '-was in conversation wvith other officers that he understood they were not allowved to send their horses down to Balaklava to procure forage. Up to about the 7th or 5th of November the forage was brought up pretty regularly; but after that, as he had stated before the commissioners, the horses had on an average only about 2A.b. of barley daily, without hay or straw. The brigandt marched from the heights on the 3d of December, and, although all the horses were led, about 17 fell dead on the march from sheer exhaustion. Thought the horses would have been better off if they had been sent for their forage. In his evidence before the commissioners he had stated that he made repeated representations .of tlle deficiency af forage. Those representations were made to Brigade-Major Mayou, but did not recollect what answer he received. Did not statethe date at which his representations were made. By Lord Cardigan.-Was sick in his tent, and not doing duty during part of the month of N,Tovember. In answer to a question from General PEEL, as to the reasons which had induced Lord Raglan to station the Light Brigade on the plateau, Major-General Airey said they had always been under the apprehension of an attack on the extreme right, and received constant applications from General Evalns for reinforcements. General Canrobert thought a division of cavalry might be advantageously posted there. Lord Raglan hesitated a long time, andvwas very anxious to avoid such a step, owing to the manifest difficulty qwhich would be experienced in feeding the horses and in getting up commissariat supplies. However, General Canroboert was so urgent on the point that Lord Reglan at last consented. The iFrench General said he could not believe that the allies would not be attacked in this position, and, though, as the ground was very steep, the Russians would arrive on the plateau breathless and without formation, they would be in such force that they would probably break through our first lines. If, however. the enemy could be met immediately by cavalry, they would, in all probability, be repulsed. However weal (continued General Canrobert) the cavalry stationed pn the plateau might be, still the very knowledge that they were there, vhich would certainly be communicated to the Russians by their spies, would very likely prevent an attack being made The reason the brigade had no pickets, as stated by Lord Cardigan, was that it was so placed, being encompassed by infantry in every direction, that this precaution was not needed. No distinct orders were issued as to the action of the cavalry, because that was quite unnecessary. Every morning an officer of his staff was ordered to be at the extreme right before daylight, and to put himself into communication with those officers whose positions were likely to be threatened. At the slightestprobability of attackthis officer was directed to gallop in or to send his orderly in to head-quarters, and before anything could tale place either Lord Raglan or he (Sir Richard .Airey) would have been on the spot. In the absence of any hi,gher authority, Sir George Brown, the senior officer of the position, would have taken upon hiiself to issue the necessary orders. VWith regard to the sending of horses down to Balaklava for forage, Lord Cardigan could not have detached any of his men on that service without the orders of Lord Lucan. The JuDGE-ADAocATE asked Lord Cardigan if he had ever considered what number of horses would have been required to carry the forage from Balaklava. Lord Cardigan repEed that 120 would have been required -60 to carry the forage and 60 for the troopers to ride. It would have been quite impossible for the rmen, badly shod as they were, to walk a distance of seven miles, stand several hours in the mnud at Balaldava, and vwalk back again. Such a proceeding would have led to a large loss of life. Colonel Tulloch, before the case of Lord Cardigan was closed, wished to make a few observations. Two questions seemed involved in the matter before the Board-one being the military question as to the expediency of sending down for forage to save the lives of the horses, and the other the accuracy of the commissioners' statenment with regard to the deficiencies of the supply. It was with the latter only that he had to deal, and, as Lord Cardigan did not impugn, either in that or in any other respect, the accuracy of the report, he should not have troubled the Board with any remarks, but for what had fallen from his Lordship in regard to the possibility of a mistalke in the evidence of Colonels Doherty and Douglas, which Lord Cardigan supposed must have arisen from a misprint or a mnisconception. In order to show that there was no reason to apprehend any such mistake, he proposed to produce the original' MS., so that the Board might satisfy themselves onl this head. Further corroboration wasi afforded in, the evidenceS of Colonel Low before the commissioners, who said that during t.he Last three weeks in November the horses had on an average only about onefifth of their reguLated rations. Colonsi Shewrell also 'stated that during at least ten days in. NSovember t.he horses were "without a blade of hay or straw and with only 31b. of barley per horse. daily." There was only one point in which Lord Cardigan did not seem qulte in unison weith the commissioners, in so far as he assumed, because the mortality in the Light Brigade was shown in the report to be only 38 per cent., while it was 47 per cent, in the lfeavy,the loss from th e want of forage could not have been so serious as appeared ny usestatemnt ofthe comissiners. is 'WashIp by the -statement of the commissioners. ois Zdship, b owever, did not seem to have adverted to the circumstance that this average was taken in the six months from October to March inclusive, duringagreat part of which the scarcity of forage was not felt; but, on referring to the months of November and December, the mortality of which had been taken separately, in order to show the probable influence of this cause on the loss of horses, at would be found that the loss in November in the Light was 12 per cent. as compared with 10 per cent. in the Heavy Brigade, and in December it was 26 per cent. in the Light as compared with 20 per cent. in the Heavy Brigade. This was quite as great a difference as could have been expected, even under the extraordinary cireumstances of the case, particularly when it was considered that in the Heavy Brigade at this time the mortality was much increased by an infectious disease which was then prevalent among the horses. In conclusion, he trusted tlmeBoard would see that the whole of the paragraphs relative to this deficient supply in the Light Brigade had been given in the report as carefully and as guardedlv as possible. The commissioners had stated the facts which they were bound to notice as a matter of duty, leaving it to others to decide the military question as to whether it was or was not expedient to send gvown the horses for forage. Lord Cardigan would again remind the Board that the commissioners, in their amended statement, could only make out a difference of 2 per cent. e 'etween the mortality of the horses in the Heavy and the Light Brigades, even in the month of November, which was the month particularly alluded to, and when all these misfortunes took place. The Board adjourned shortly before 4 o'clock until Thurs-' day, when the case of Sir Richard Airey wi be proceeded with. -_-_i [Advertisemnenti-" Bentley's 3flscellanly," price 2s. &dL, fSor Bay, contains :-The Joint Stodc Bankecr, by Dudley Costello-The Royal Academy Exhbition-Court of Austria-The 8pendtbrift, by W.Ham60en istrrtb, E sq.-Siumaer Days atTenby-Tom iotss~ Prze-Omar Pacs'as campai n-Mother Ford-roeie Hist4r~ of Greece, te.

U: PMW INiz'ELLIWe1Y,. -'C OXFOR.- ARTUT.T 9 In a Congregation held this day, at 2 o'clock, the form of statute on the subject of the Bodleian Library was promnulgated. After the ztatute had been read by the Registrar Dr. Pusey rose to explain its various provisions on the paXT of the Council and the Curators, who had taken part in it* preparation. At the close of his speech, which occupiec nearly.an hour, Professor Jowett rose and expresed his dislike of the followingpoints in the statute --L The requiremnent that the librarian shall upon his election sign the artides. 2, The limitations of the office of sub-librarian to Graduates of the University. 3. The proviso thatneithethe librarian nor the sub-librarian sball hold a cure oF zouls at a greater distance than five miles from Oxford, or where the population is above 200. 4. The want of any provision for books being talen out of the library during the time that it is shut. 5. The increased burden thrown by the statute on the library fund. On the last three points he moved amendments, which were signed by several of the -persons-present. Mr. Lancaster, of Queen's, proposed two amendments. The purport of the first we did not catch; the second was to the effect that strict sEilence should be maintained in the new Reading-room.. Mr. Rogers, of Magdalen-hall, strongly opposed the limitation upon the holding of cures by the librariau and sub-librarians. Ile e-xpressed his opinion that the library fund might easily be augmented by an increase in the annual payment Irevn memnbers of the University, to which no one would obiect, and which non-Residents would gladly pay if released from the burdens now unfairly thrown upon them. Mr. Foreman, of All Soule, likewise opposed the clause putting a limitation upon the holding -of cures. He -would substitute a proviso requiring the consent of the Curators. iMr. Chase, of Oniel, objected to the election oi the librarian by Convocation, and also to the limitation with regard to cures. Professor Hus.ey inquired whether le proposed any amendment on the Uatter point. Mr. Chase replied in the negative. Professor Wall agreed -with the objections of Professor Jowett, and suggested that greater liberty might be allowved with regard to exaamining the coins in the library. He would suggest that they shoul, d be exhibited unde,r glass. He also wished tath the library might be opened at the usual hour on ordinary saints' days. E'rofessor Pusey replied and explained. :r. Coxe, of Corpus, suggested that a liberty should be allowetl to the Curators of closing the new retading-room, if it shouild not het used at on ear;ier hour than 10. The Congregation was then disolved. In the Convocation to be held on Thursday, May 8, at 2 o'clock, itwill be proposed tothe Houseto grant 145L Bs. 6d. for the building repairs of the Botanic-garden, according to the recommendation of a delegacy appointed by the proctors. The public examinations in the classical school are adjourned over Ascension-day.

TALLoWv.-The nmarket is quiet to-day at 46s. 6d. to 46s.d 'Lon the spot, and 4Gs for the last three months. On the position of the trade Messrs. Colchester and Woolner remark :-"We have but little alteratioji to notice in the tallow-marlket. There has been a steady demand for consumption throughoutthe week, vith a few trifling orders for exuort; for forward delivery, however, there has been less disposition to operate, and we note prices rather lower *forthe end of the year. The letters from St. Petersburg quote prices at 13S roubles on the spot and 137 roubles withi 10 down for August, at which busmess was done. It was expected that the navigation would open about the 15th of May, but there was a great scarcity of lighters, so it woTld be late before goods could be loaded off. The tallow that was caught in the ice at Konigsberg had got away ; it amounts to 2,000 casks." ITLTAuB -A-D fsDZS.-The supply of fresh leather at I.eadenball to-day was moderate. A fairinquiry prevailed for light butts, skis, and kins of all averages, at former quotations. Eorse niidesarealso in snore request, but there as little doing in heavy foreign butts or dressing hides. llarket hides in fair supply, with a languid demand, at rather lower rates. -
STATE OF TRADE. MANCHESTER, APRIL 2!1. We have had a dull market, but mostly at last prices No doubt the excitement of the last few weeks, arising partly from the conclusion of peace, and partly from a long-continued rise in the price of cotton, has brougeht many buyers into thc market otherwise dispoeed to hatve held over their orders for a time longer. A pause under such circumstances is not very unusual, and one which 3night be expected now that the snarket for the raw material is quieter. The demand for the home trade continnes steady, and the India and China letters to hand this morning report favourably of trade in the :Eastern markets. At last dates there had been sonne fair sales, at prices which would cover the rates at which goods then to hand had been purchased, but which are not held to be encouraging for exports hence at the terms on which buyers can now enter the market here. There has been a mutual indisposition on the part of both buyers and sellers of cloth this morning to do business-on the part of the former because of continued high rates, and on the part oi the latter because they are generally supplied with orders for the present and are averse to any concession. In yarns the demand has been linmted, and in some cases sellers have been rather easier to deal with. Mlessrs. John Slagg and Co. report:- " There is no new feature in the market to-day. With the exception of a few articles for the home trade which. are in fair request, and for which full prices are obtained, there is exceedingly little business doing. The late advance in yarns being finrly maintained, and manufactarers generally beinlg free from stocks, there is no giving way in prices; hut buyers still steadily keep aloof, and this week there is even less doig than last. The India and China accounts to hand this morning, though generaDy crnsidered satisfactory, have not ta yet led to any increased demaLd for those markets."

THE A.caasiTEn SCHOOL OF AnT.-The anyjua, meetiDg tookplaceattheRoyalInstitution, Manchester, on Monday. The committee reported that they stiU continued to receive about the sameamoutof Governmect.grant (3801.), with the small allowance (5!.) for pupil tfcuhers, but had to record their opinion of its continued higb standing and utility as a practical school of art. They weCre endecvouring to extend the benefits of the school by the establishmnent of a class for artissns, and by giving instruction in various public schools, both at a very low rate of charge. The success, or otherwise, which miught attend these cfferte ould be mnore fully explained in a future report. The committee had still to regret the existence of the debt referred to in their last report, and a slight increase of it, and wuld recolmmend to their successors varionsreductions in expenses, and their appeal to the public for donations to clear offarrear 3Mr. Hammerdley, the head master, read a report, referring vith Eatisfaction to the progress of the pupils, as shown in the share of prizes tal;en by them at the exsbition in London. Mr. Edmnund Fotter. chaiman of the meeting, expressed regret that the sehcol was not; better supported by the public, and hoped that the governors of the Royal Institution would yet exhibit more synpathy in their behalf by relinquishing the whole or Ipar of the 2Z0.. per annum charged to the school for rent in that building. Mr. Rmnney suggested that there might possibly be room enough in the new Mfechanics Institution for the sehool, and that ite might be obtained at a lcwer rent. He had lately been through the Potteries, and visited ,the works of Copeland, 3finton, and Elkington, where ihe progress of design had m,ade an extraordinary advance, and the way in which the public purchasedtbe productions of these works he thought showed that they bad a frll apreciation of the beautifulin design in art now that theywere to be obtained.

PABLIAMENTARY INTELLIGENCE. HOUSE OF LORDS, TuEsiiAY, ArR 29. The LIOD CIA.CELLOR took his seat on the woolsack ht 5 o'clock. NEW PEER. * Baron AvELr.icD (Sir G. Heathcote, Bart.,) took the oaths at the table, and signed the roll of Parliament. ROYAL COMMISSION. The Royal assent was given by commaission to the foUowing bills, the Royal Commissoners being the Lord Chanllor, the Duke of Argyll, and Lord MontCgle: xchcquer Bills (21.182,7001. ), Public Works, Public Wforls Ireland), London: Docks, Knottingley Gas, Colonial Bank, .Weymouth and Melcombe Gas, Gaishorou"h Gas, Chorley aterworkis, Haslingden and RawPtonstal Waterworks, -launceston Gas, and Southport Water Bills. COMMUNICATION WITIH AUSTRALIA. The Farl of ELLEE BOROUGH, in the absence of Lord Hardwicke, presented two petitions, oen from bankers, raer'chants, and othets of London, andtiteether from the general assocation of the Australixn colocies, pra6yiag that a steam postal communication might be re-established with Australia. Such a conmmunication had been established, but was suddenly discontinued in Novenber, ISM, ewn-, to the demand for steamships consequent upon the war. The petitioners complained that postal cowunonication with Australia alone * hd beens discontinued, sodsvoenunicion having been mintained with all the offecr oloies; and they expres3ed theirsenve of the importiceof regularpestal cominunction with the Australian colomies, inasmuch as British goods had been imported into those colonies in the coQrse 'of a sr to the value of 14j),0,000., and last year the exports of gId from the colonies to this country amounted to 1,000,001. The colonists had expresasd their readiness to contribute to the expense of postal communication in preoortion to tke number of letters received in and sent from each oaEony. They were inost desirous that an independent line 'of communication should be established between this couirey and Australia, that it should be conducted by the shortest route, and that the average speed of the asels employed should be 10 knots an hour. that no tine shouldbelestin commencing the communication. He (the Earlof Elienborough) certainlythought that these were very fairdemnands-on the part of the colonists. It was mo6t reasonablethatthecolonies shoulc contribute in equal proportions to the expense of this communication; and, indeed, two of the largest of them had already intimated their willingness to hear their share of the bsrden. At present a heavy loss was sustained by the Treasury of thiscountry in carrving on the postal commtuications with our colonies; -and the last return published on the subject showed the annual less on the North American line to amount to G7,0O00.; that en the East Indian line to 70,0001.; and that on the line to the 'West Indies, Mexico, and Braz:il, to 15,000u. The latter item amounted to very nearly 3A per cent, of the total value of the exports from this country to the West Indies, Mexico, and the Brazils. However important our postal communications with these coloniesand foreig>n Powecrs,it was a question for the serious consideration of the Government whether the expenseto this country ought not to be materially diminished. The Duke of AEIGYLL said, that the enormous loss to this country in respect of the packet service to different parts of the world bad attracted the serious attention of the Government, and still engaged its consideration. He was glad to find that the noble earl gave the sanction of his high authority to the justice of calling on the Australian colonies to bear half the expense of their postal communication with this country; but in regard to those colonies it was not necessary to make any .such demand, bec.ause they had spontaneously evinced a liberal disposition to contribute towards thisobject. Theprayerof the memorialiststo which the noble earl referred had receied the most favourable consideration from the Government, and steps were being taken, as far as possible, to meet their views. It might not, however, be possible to obtain vessels for the service of the power which the noble earl desired; yet he could only say that he hoped it would. PROCLAMATION OF PEACE. The Bishop of EXETER, in p resenting a petition, took occasion to express a hope that Her Majesty's advisers would not allov the restoration of peace to pass withont - offering on the part of the nation some testimony of humble thankfulness to Almighty God for the mercy vouchsafed to this country through the happy event proclaimed that day. The question whether or not certain places of amusement should be opened to the people on Sumday was frequently discussed ; but, in his opinion, it was a mockery to prohibit them from the enjoyments to which they were inclined unless they were provided with the means of spendint the Lord's day in the service of God. The present was, therefore, a peculiarly fitting time to show that we were not wholly insensible to the Divine blessings heaped upon usq, by seenring to large masses of the people that accommodation for attendin- public worship of which they were still destitute. It was true that in these days the church was not the sole claimant on the support of the public for religious and other objects; but there was no reason why the system, which had on the whole worked so well for the promotion of education, should not be extended to supply the lamentable deficiency to which he had referred, or wvhy a considerable sum should not be granted by the State to help those who wrere wilIling to help themselves in building churches and other places of w orship. Lord BERNERS presented a petition from the clergy resident within the city and rural deanery of Lichfield, praying that the law as to church-rates might be only so far altered thatits intention and objects might beclearly defined; that the rate might be charg-ed on the owners of property, and rendered capable of inexpensive and sunmmary enforcement. THE ItRE BRIGADE OF THE HOUSE. LordI.EDESDALEpresentedse-eralpetitions, and, among others, one from Mr. Scott, late engineerto the New Palace at Westminster, compliiningthat lie had been deprivedof his appointment. The noble lord observed that the case of Mr. Scott appeared a very hard one. He had discharged his duties with uniform zeal and efficiency, yet he had been deprived of his office, -which he had re&arded as permanent, and aniotherman bad been appointed m his pLace. The dismissal of this gentleman, coupled with that of the firemen, favoured the idea that there was a general intention among persons in authority to get rid of every one who had been appointed by Sir C. Barry. Reverting to the case of the fremen, which he still regarded as one of peculiar hardship, he was arthorized to state that the fire to which the noble duke opposite (the Dkle of Somerset) had alluded the other evening, as having taken place in the house, had occurred in the clock tower, a portion of the building which, being in the hands of contractors, was beyond the control and responsibility of the fire-brigade. (Hear.) He still adhered to the opinion that the dismissal of these poor men was a harsh and arbitrary proceeding, for which there was the less excuse When it was remembered that, so far from promoting economy, it would defeat it, the cost of the old system being only GJTt1., while that of the new would be 1,1201. n-year. The innovation -would occasion much distress to a number of poor and deserving men who had performed their duties with strict propriety, and, as the advantage to the public was more than problemetical, some better reason should have been assigned for it than the mnerefact that the building, being a Queen'sPalace,wasunder thejurisdiction of the Board of *Vorks, who might make what regulations they pleased. It was only the other day th.at r. Gurney, who bad the superintendence of the ventilation, declared that he did not think the house would be so secure from fire under the new as it had been under the old system. (Hear, hear.) The Duke of SOMERSET repudiated the intention of casting censure on the firemen, and should, indeed, be sorry if anything he had said were interpreted in the sense of calling in question any claim they might have to compensation for tho loss of their appointments, or to remuneration for their past services. Their dismissal was no act of his.. He had merely expressed himself against the principle of such divided responsibility as must ensue if the fire arrangements were under the joint control of the Board of Works, the contractors: the police-constables, and the brigade. * Lord STANLEY of ALDERLEYobserved thatthePalace being no vunder the undivided control of the First Commissioner of the Board of Works, that Afinister was entirely responsible for its safety, and it was by no means expedient for their lordships to interfere with the arrangements which he in the discharge of his important public duty might think fit to adopt. With respect to Mlr. Scott, his appointment was a new one, bearing date as recently as 1851, and that he could not himself have regardedit as permanent vas evidenced by the fact that, in 1853, he applied for the office of engineer to the Hanwvell Lunatic Asylum. Lord MONTEAGLE concurred in the opinion that the firemen had been hardly treated, and expressed a hope that they would receive compensation. The subject then dropped. THE FALL OF EARS. The Earl of 3IAIZESBURY.-In rising to move that the surnaons to your lordships to attend on Friday evening be discharged, i think it right to state that it is my intention to withdraw the'notice I have given of the motion I had meant to submit on that evening with respect to the surrender of K-ars. (Hear, hear.) It is with extreme regret that I find myself coerced by circumstances to tnaLe this course, for I can assure your lordships that T n-A a eysneead ans netott bigti n Inad a very sincere and earnest intention to ,brinL hiain teresting subject under your consideration. For the delays which unfortunately prevent me from doing so your lordships will admit that I am in no degree responsible. In the first place, the noble lord the Secretary for Foreign Affairs remained, absent three weeks longer then we expected; in the next, the importance of my motion rendered it neces. sarythat I should give a full week's notice of it, and as your lordships do not sit next Thursday-that being Ascensioni-day-I could name no earlier day than next Friday for the debate. But no later than yester- day the Foreign Secretary laid the Treaty of Paris on the table, and as he has invited us to talce it into consideration on Monday evening, I cannot think that it -would meet the approval of veor lordships to forestaU the interest of that great occasion by reniarks and animadversions on such subjects as the war in Asia 3inor and the surrender of Kars-topics w hich it would beymp ossible to dliscuss without reference to their consequences as revealed by the treatv. (Hear.) Un der these circumstances, I have tfiought that the better course is to withdraw the motion. Ead I not done so we should have had two debates on the s&me subject, the one on Friday, the other on fonday, ajad, as it is manifestly desirable that if we are to spend two evenings inthe discussion of the same topic, they should be consecative evenings, I trmst your lord 5bips wiU be of opinion that I am now acting in the manner mnost conducive to your convenience. (er, he-tr.) I would be under- stood, however, as reserving to myself the right of bringing forwaza ay motion I may think fit on Mionday evening. I wish to ask mny noble friend whether he haa any objection to by on your lordabips' table, on Friday, the terms of the address which Lord Clarendon will move on Monday next ? Earl GRANVILLE.-If I rightly understand the noble lord, he altogether withdraws his notice of motion with rcspect to Kars. The Earl of MALCMEBURY.-Yes. EArl GRANVLLE.-I am glad to hear it. ("Hear, hear," and a laugh.) The Earl of MALIMESBURY.-The noble earl has not re. plied to my question. Earl GRANVILLE.-The terms of the motion to be made by my noble friend on Monday evening will be laid on your lordships' table on Friday. MERCANTLE LAW. AMENDMENT BILL. AND MERCANTILE LAW (SCOTLAND) BILL. On the order for the committee on these bills Lord BROOGIhSA expressed his opinion tlat the object of these maeasures-the assimilation of the commercial law of England and Scotland-would have been attained more advantageously by one than by two bills; but said that the chbes proposed were so valable that he would rather accept them in the less convenient form than throw any obstacle in the way of their adoption. The LORD CEANCELLOR said, the objection raised by the noble and learned lord had been very deliberately considered, and it had been thought that the change would be better effected on the whole by two biUls than by one. Lord CAMPBELL said, the bills were a step in the right direction, and were calculated to renmove much of the discrepancy which at present existed. He hoped, therefore, that they would pass into law without delay. The House theu went into committee. On clause 1, repealing the 17th section of the act passed in the 29th year of the reign of King Charles II., chap. 3, whereby it is enacted, that "no contract for the sale of any goods, wares, and merchandises for the price of 101. sterling or upwards shall be allowed to be good, except lthe buyer shag accept part of the goods so sold, and actually receive the same, or give something in earnest to bind the bargain, or in part of payment, or that some note or memorandum in writing of the said bargain be made and signed by the parties to be charged by such contract, or their agents thereunto lawfully authorized," The LORD CHANCELLOR observed that the commissioners who had the subject under their consideration, had come to the conclusion that the clause which it was now proposed to repeal was more productive of evil than good. In the eases of the sale of goods of the value of 101. the very circumstances of the case necessarily dispensed with the observance of the rule, which, it was found, could not be practically enforced. In confirmation of this view, the evidence taken before the commissioners distinctly proved that it was entirely disregarded at Liverpool, achester, and Glasgow. Lord BROUGHAM observed that there had been many instances of this section of the act of Parliament becoming the refuge of fraudulent parties in the very teeth of the main object of the statute, which was the prevention of fraud. The clause was then agreed to, as were also the remaining clauses of the bill. T'he 'Mercantile Law (Scotland) Amendment Bill was next passed through committee. FAIRS AND MARKETS IN IRELAND. The Earl of CLA.NTCARTY rose to ask whether it was the intention of the Government to propose any bill to Parliament founded on the report of the commissioners apuointed to inquire into the state of fairs and markets in Ireland in 1833? He said that the report of the commissioners represented the existence of a state of things most injurious to the entire commerce of the country. The inquiry of the commicsioners was understood to be conducted with a view to legislation, and also for tbe purpose of enabling statistical returns to be procured, by which the Government mightbeabletoknowthe amount of agricultural produce and animals sold. In the existing state of the, law such returns could not be.had. It appeared by the report that there was great variety in the tolls ievied in markets and fairs, some of the tolls being fixed, some acl ralovrcm, and some being taken in kind; and they were generally in no degree dependent on the amount of accommodation afforded. Another great evil was the -ariety in the weights and measures. The necessity of some change had been sufficientlyestablished. Tolls had been levied in many places without the least value having been given for them, and they became so unpopular that in many Places the people revolted against them, and they could not be collected. Several commissions and committees had sat and reported npon the imrportance of a change. In 1826 a commission declared that the regnlation of fairs and markets required early attention. In 1830, the committee upon the state of the poor in Ireland recommended a change in the existing system. In 1835, the commissioners for inquiring into the state of municipal corporations in Ireland adverted to the necessity of a reform in this respect. A remedy however was still wanting. So great had been the inconveuience that the Government had refused to give any new owers to colsect tolls, and new fairs and markets could not o ebtablished without an act of Parliament. A bill was laid upon the table in 1.54 by Viscount Palmerston, then Home Secretary, with a view to its being considered during the recess. He trusted it would not be unreasonable if he asked the Government to proceed with a measure which so many competent witnesses had declared to be necessary to put an end to a source of social demoralization, and which could not fail to promote the social development of Irelaxd. Earl GRANIVILLE said that, in addition to the bill brought in by Lord Palmerston in 1854, a bill of a similar character had been introduced by Sir J. Young. The present Secretary for Ireland had also turned his attention to the subject, but he had not been able to find such an agreement among the Irish members as had hitherto encouraged himn to frame a measure on the subject. There could be no question of the anomalous state of the law, and he had no doubt his light hon. friend (Mr. Horsman) would not relax in his attempts to come to a satisfactory understanding with the Irish membeirs. He was, however, unable to give anypledge that a bill would be introduced dtuingthepresent session upon the subiect which had been brought under their lordships' attention by the noble earl. SOUTHAMiPTONT AND DORCHESTER RAILWAY. The Earl of 31 ALMESBUTtY wished to d-aw the attention of the noble lord at the head of the Board of Trade to the circumstances attending the covenant made in 1845 by the company which constructed the Southampton and Dorchester Railway. That railway was a continuation of the Loindon and Southampton Railway. The act of Parliament authorizing the construction of a railway from Southampton to Dorchester, 55 miles in length, contained the following clause: "And whereas it is intended that only a single line of rails should he laid down in the first instance on the railway by this act authorized, but that the bridges and other works of the said railway should be so constructed as to admit of the formation of a double line of rails, at any time hereafter, if required. Asnd whereas it is expedient, in the event of the gross annual proceeds of the said railway company amounting-from the traffic on the said railway to the sum of 65,0001., that the said company should lay down and maintain another or double line of rails on the said railway - be it therefore enacted that whenever, and as soon as the gross annual receipts of the said company shall amount to or exceed, on the average of three consecutive years, the sum of 65,0001., the said company shall, and they are hereby required, on the request of the Board of Trade, to lay down with all reasonable despatch, and to maintain tlhereafter an additional or double line of rails on the said railway for the greater convenience and accommodation of the traffic thereon." Six weeks ago he presented a memorial to the Board of Trade, signed by 20 or 22 members of Parliament, all residing within reach of the railway in Hampshire and Dorsetsbire, and also by many tradesmen and farmers, stating their belef that the time had arrived when the Southampton and Dorchester Railway Company ought to be bound to fulfil their covenant, inassnuch .as the receipts for the last three years would exceed the average of 65,0001, which justified the Board of Trade in requirin- a a double line to be laid down. He wished to ask the noble lord whether, in consequence, of this memorial he had addressed a letter to the directos of the London and SouthWestern Railway, who were one and the same with the Southampton and Dorchester Railway? Hedid not place such entire confidence in the SouthWestern Railway Company as he would be inclined to repose in many other railway companies, for it might be recollectedthat the South-Western Company had had the misfortune to appear before that and the other House of Parliament in a very unfavourable light. About three years ageTthat company made use of their directors to - vent a rnval company from carrying a bill in the otoer House for the construction of a railway between Dorchester and the west. He would not enter inito any discussion as to the desirability of that line, although he might observe that it was strongly advocated by the late Dike of WVellington. The South-Western Company, how.- ever, did not fulfil the covenant into which they then en- tered, for the shareholders, after having made use of their directors, repudiated at a general meeting the engagements into which they had entered, and were thus guilty of somethig very like a fraud upon both Houses of Parliament. The gentlemen who were at that time in the direction of the South-Western Company most honoiuably resignedtheirpositions, and were succeeded by others who, although he could not say they approved the conduct of the rhareholders, showed by accepting office that they did not feel so strongly on the subject as their predecessors. He thought the South-Western Company, if they had intended to act honestly and fairly by the public, would not have pursued a system of secrecy, but would at once havesaid, "Thememonalists are mistaken; our receipts are only so mu^h they have not yet arrived at the pomt whi h would impose on us the obligation of continnmug the works on the line, but whenthey do reach that amount the Board of Trade may rest assured that the fact shall he communicated to them." In reply to the memorals, ho received the following answer from the Board of Trade . "With reference to the memorials forwarded to this department from the inhabitants of the district adjoining the outhampton and Dorchester Railway, pray Ig my lords to require the london and South-WesternRailway companyto lay a second line of rails upon that line, mylordsdirect me to request you to inform them of the grounds upon which the, statemnent of the gross annual reoeipts7for theyears 1853 anid 1854 roceeds." He(Lordylalmesbary) had no hesitation in saying that thit, statement rested upon the authority of one of the gentlemen who hadA retired from. T_e direction of the South-Westemr Company, who, as a dirgetor, had the right to obtain auch returns, ant with whoÃ¯Â¿Â½e name his noble- friend opposite (Lord Stanley) was acquainted. Those returns shorred that the aggregate receipts of the year to which they referred would amnount> to 13,6801, showing an excess of aboub ,6301. over the amox t of inomne, which imposed uponi the company the duty of malking the line a double one. There had, he believed, since been a considerable increase in the receipts on the whole line, and all he asked the shareholders of the South-Western Railway to do was to fulfil, like honourable men, the engagement into which they had entered. It was most important that railway companies should for their own sakes keep faith with Parliament, for they were constantly applying to both Houses to sanction nbw speculations and arrangements. He believed that at this moment the South-Western Company had abill before the other House, for a railway from Yeovil to Exeter, and he hoped a provision would be introduced into that measure conpellig them, with a view to the safety and convemence of the public, to forr a double line as soon as the undertaking yielded a remunerative return. Although, however, the South-western Company were bound by the act of Parliament to double the line of rails, on the requisition of the Board of Trade, when the receipts reached a certain amount, the board had no power to compel the company to make a return of their income. HSecertainly thought the Board of Trade ought to possess such a power * but if the company still refused to show their accounts, he would not scruple to apply to their Icrdships to compel the company to produce those accounts before a comnmittee of that House. Lord STANLEY of AIDERLEY said, the noble earl had correctly described the position of the South-Western Railway Company. By a clause in their act of Pariiament that company, when their gross annual receipts for a period of three years hndbeen65,000., were bound tolaydown a second line of rails on the railway to which the noble earl referred. A memorial was presented to the Board of Trade about six weeks ago from a number of influential inhabitants along the whole line, praying that the company might be required to fulfil this engagement. On the 12th of March he forwarded a copy of that memorial to the South-Western Company, and receiving no reply he wrote to request that one might be sent. Last Saturday (as we understood) he received a letter from the company, reither admitting nor denying the representations which hed been made as to the amount of their receipts, but alleging that there were some inaccuracies in the statements of the memorial, and urging reasons which should induce the Board of Trade not to insist upon the construction of a second line oE railway at present. Owing to the peculiar position of this company, there was some difficulty in enforcing a return of the accounts. If the railway had been a complete line from Southampton to Dorchester, as it was when the act of Parliament was obtained, there would be no difficulty on the point; but since that period the line had been amaigamateXwiththe South-Western, andtheremight be some dHliculty in obtaining a return of the recei ts of a portion of the railvay. This was a difficulty which ought to be removed. It was quite unreasonable to suppose that Parliament would have imposed obligations upon a company accompanied by conditions which could not be' enforced; and if, therefore, the difficulty was found to exist, he would be prepared either by a general bill or by a clause in one of the bills of the South-Western Company for obtaining additional powers to render compulsory the production of such returns as would enable the board to judge whether the continigency had arrived which entitled them to call upon a company to carry into effect the engagements into which they had entered. He had no reason at present to suppose that the South-Western Companywould refuse to afford the information which was required. He had that day addressed a letter to the company, requesting a return of the receipts between Southampton and Dorchester for the years 1853, 1854, and 1855, and until he received a reply to that application he would abstain from expressing any opinion as to whether it was right and proper that the Board of Trade should enforce the conditions imposed by the act, or whether the reasons which had beenputforward bythe company were sufficient to exempt thenm from the immediate fulfilment of their engagement. The Earl of MAMESBURY observed that the statement of the noble lord would be in a great measure satisfactory to many of the persons who had signed the memorial. As to the difficulty anticipated by the noble lord with reference to the production of the accounts, he (Lord hfalmesbury) understood that they had hitherto been separately kept. Their lordsbips adjourned at 7 o'clock.

Mr. BRADY asked the Secretary of the Treasury, whether the_ Government intended giving instructions for the prosecution of the man Perkins and others, owneis of " leaving-shops," who appeared before Sir W. Carden at Guildhall, a few days ago, for receiving goods and lending money thereon without having a pawnbroker's license; also, whether (in the event of thelaw being found imperfect, s> as not to reach snch cases), he intended introducing any measure this session having for its object the suppression of places so incentive to crime ? Mr. WILSON said, that the Board of Inland Revenue had received no intimation from Sir W. Carden of the circumstance to wiiich the hon. member had aUuded. The board, however, was of opinion that the law was in a defective state, and he proposed in a few days to bring in a measure to amend it. (Hear, hear.) MILITARY BANDS IN THE PARKS. _ The Marquis of BLANDFORD asked the Chief Commissioner of Works if he wonld state what arrangements had bcen jnade, or were contemplated, with reference to the performance of the military bands in the public parks on Sundays; that was to say, in which of the public parks it was proposed that the military bands should in future perform ; and whether there was any truth in the statements that had appeared, that preparations were contemplated in suchplaces for the accommodation of the performers and ihe public by the erection of an orchestra, and a place for the sale of refreshments? Colonel NORTH wished to put another question on the same subject before tho right hon. gentleman, opposite replied. The bands of regiments were composed of private soldiers of the regiments to the extent of 14 men, and they were entirely supported at tho expense of the officers. Hitherto it had been always customary to ask permission of the officers commanding, and it had been considered a great favour when ofiicers aUowed their bands to play on public occasions. He wished to ask tho right hon. gentleman whether it was hy permission of the commanding officers that the bands now played in the parks, or whether, for the future,orders with respect to playing were to proceed from other authorities than the commanding officers? SirB. HALL, in answering, first, the question of the gaUant officer who had just sat down, said that he had made 3 communication to the noble lord at tho head of the Horse Guards, and had requested that he would give directions that the bands should play. He believed that his noble friend thereupon communicated with the ofiicers commanding regiments, but upon this he could not speak with certainty. All that he (Sir B. HaU) had done was to take the nsual step of communicating with the Commander in Chief, leaving it to the noble lord to adopt what course he thought proper. With regard to the payment of the bandsmen for their performances on Sunday an arrangement had been made which met with the entire approval of Colonel Williams, the officer commanding the 2d Lif e Guards. (Hear.) He had great pleasure in answering the question of the noble lord (Blandford), which in fact *-esolved itself into four questions. In answer to the first, he said that the House was aware that last autumn he gave directions that the bind should play in Kensington Gardens for the recreation-he might say the innocent recreation-(hear, hear) of the inhabitanta of this vast metropolis; and he found that the numbers who thronged to lis1*-! to the music there provided varied from 35,000 to 75,000 persons. The arrangements which were made last year had been commenced, and would be continued this year. (Hear, hear.) Ja answer to the second question, he had to state that the numoer of persons who assembled last Sunday week in Kensington Gardens wa3 7^247. He considered it to be inconvenient that the whole mass ofthe population should be brought to one point, and he had therefore given directions-with the entire approval. and concurrence of Colonel Williams-that the band shor>id play in Regent's Park on Sunday next; andit would play each succeeding Sunday, weather permitting, betwfjen the hours of divine service. (Hear, hear.) With regard to Victoria Park, he had received a letter from lieutenantColonel Dickson, Queen's Own light Infantry, offering to permit the hand of that regiment to play in Victoria Park. He (Sir B. HaU) should return an woswer to-morrow, thanking the gallant officer for his communication and accepting his offer; and the band would phiy in Victoria Park at the same hours as in the others on Sunday week. (Cheers.) His answer to the third question was, that the only accommodation which had been provided for the performers was the platform on which they had played for many years on Tuesdays aud Fridays. That platform was very smaU and inconvenient, and a new one was to be made, which would probably be brought into use on Sunday or Sunday week. With regard to the fourth question, he had to state that no further accommodation had yet been provided for the public in Kensington Gardens beyond that which he found there when he oame into office. He was aware that this accommodation was not at aU commensurate with the wants ofthe persons who assembled there; and, alfhotighhehadnottakena vote in the estimates for any addition to that accommodation, jet, if he found that there was a vast assemblage of persons, he should feel it to be his duty, for the accommodation and convenience of those who might assemble there, to put up some temporary building or tent in which the necessary refreshments might be supplied. He should add that the refreshments which were provided there were of the most innocent character, consisting of tea, coffee, ices, sodawater, and such non-intoxicatingdrinks. (Hear, hear.) He (Sir B. HaU) was present in Kensington Gardens last Sunday week, when upwards of 79,000 persons assembled. He saw there many members of both Houses of Parliament, and he was sure that they would agree with him that the conduct of the people was beyond aU praise. In confirmation of this, he might add that every Jfonday morning the superintendent of the gardens brought to hxm a report, the invariable purport of which was, that such admirable order had been maintained that not a single shrub had been damaged orthe slightest injury inflicted. It was therefore his intention to proceed as he had begun (hear, hear), and to afford that recreation to the inhabitants of the metropolis which they seemed thoroughly to enjoy, of which by their conduct they were worthy, and which, he was happy to say, they appreciated. (Cheers.) The Marquis of BLANDFORD asked whether any correspondence had taken place between the right hon. gentleman and the noble lord at the head of the army, or between him and his Royal Highness the Ranger of the Parks upon this subject; and, if so, whether he would have any objection to lay the correspondence on the table ? Sir B. HALL.-The only correspondence which had taken place upon the subject had been one letter which he had addressed to the Commander in Chief, requestmghim to aUow the bands to play, and stating that it would be on his sole responsibUity, and to that request his noble friend had at once acceded. (Hear, hear.) Lord R. GROSVENOR wished to ask the noble lord at the head of the Government whether any of the bandsmen whose Sunday afternoon was thus taken away from them might, if they objected to the loss of that rest, or if they entertained conscientious scruples, petition any authority upon the subject ? (Hear, hear.) Lord PALMERSTON said, that the question referred to a matter of detaU with regard to which he was unable to give an answer. ASCENSION DAY. Sir J. PAKINGTON rose to ask the First Lord of the Treasury, whether it was his intention to propose any observance of Ascension Day, either by foUowing the Drece<3ent long established by the other House of Parliament. of adjourriing over that day, or by at least adopting the practice of this House with respect to Ash Wednesday, that, in order to aUow attendance on Divine worship neither the House nor committees should on that day meet before 2 O'clock? Lord PALMERSTON thought that there would be no objection to the latter arrangement, and there was no objection to a motion being made, that on Thursday the House and^the conrmittees of the Honse should meet at 2 o'clock. (A laugh.) CHURCH-RATES. IF Sir J. PAKINGTON said* that, as the bUl respecting chuich-rates of the hon. member forthe Tower Hamlets had been virtually adopted by the Government, he wished to know if the right hon. gentleman the Secretary for the Home Department proposed to proceed with that bUl tomorrow, or whether it could not be postponed nntU certain returns which he had moved for connected with the subject were ready? Sir G. GREY said, that the bUl was not virtually the bUl of the Government until the House agreedto certain amendments wiiich the Government intended to propose. If the hon. gentleman the member for the Tower Hamlets brought on the bill to-morrow, he should be prepared to move those amendments. THE TREATY OF PEACE. Mr. LAYARD wished to put a question to ihe noble lord at the head of the Govemment. The noble lord had proposed that the treaty of peace should be taken into consideration on Monday next, and he wished to ask the noble lord whether it was the intention of the Government to move that an address be presented to Her Majesty upon the .subject; and, if so, whether previous to Monday, the terms of that address would he submitted for the consideration of the House ? Lord PALMERSTON was understood to say that the ordinary practice had been for some independentmember of that House to propose an address to the Crown. THE FIREWORKS IN THE PARKS. In reply to Lord HoTHAar, The CHANCELLOR of tho .EXCHEQUER stated ihat the estimated cost of the fireworks which it was intended to display in the parks did not exceed 6,000?., and it was not the intention of the Government to propose any estimate for that amount, but to defray it out of the fund for civU contingencies. OBSOLETE" STATUTES. Mr. LOCKE KING obtained leave to bring in a bUl to repeal certain statutes which are sleeping, and not in use. CONSTABULARY FORCE (IRELAND). Mr. M'MAHON rose to caUthe attention of the House to the snbject matter of a petition from certain inhabitants of the parishes of KUbegnet and BaUynakiU, in the county of Galway, presented on the 26th of March last year, andto move for the appointment of a select committee to investigate the aUegations of such petition, and to consider the expediency of devising means for restraining the wholesale depopulation of rural districts in Ireland. It was not his wish to cause any delay in proceeding to the adjonrned debate, with regard to which so much interest existed, andhe trusted that the Government would either consent to the appointment of a committee, or would give him another day for bringing on the motion. The hon. gentleman was proceeding with his address when he was interrupted by the Usher cf the Black Rod, who summoned the House to attend in the House of Peers to hear the Royal assent given by commission to certain bills. The Speaker then left the honse, accompanied by several hon. members. Upon his return the right hon. gentleman informed the House that he had attended the House of Lords, and had heard the Royal assent given to certain bills (for the titles of which see Lords' report). Mr. M'MAHON resumed. He said that, not having received any assurance from Her Majesty's Government thai an opportunity would be given to him to bring forward his motion at a future time, he should proceed. The facts were these .-On the 26th of March last year he presented a, petition from the inhabitants of KUbegnet and BaUynakiU, m the county of Galway, signed by 1,400 persons, which stated that a Mr. AUen PoUock and Margaret his wife had purchased in the Encumbered Estates Court a property of the extent of 7,414 statute acres, on which were 500 tenants, and about 2,500 souls; that, although the tenants didnot owe a penny for rent, and were prepared to lodge their rent in advance in some bank, and although in conversation Mr. Pollock had promised not to evict a single man, Mr. PoUock had suddenly proceededvto eject the whole 500 tenantsand their families; thatnodistrictwasmorefree from outrage of every description, yet the constabulary had been increased and appeared to be under the control and direction of one of the sons of Mr. PoUock; that on the 12th of February a large ponce force marched upon the property, and a process-officer served indiscrhninately notices of ejectment, in some instances by nailing ihem to the doors of the houses. The petitioners prayed tho House to take the matter into consideration, and save from ruin and certain death so many inoffensive and loyal subjects. There was no gentleman in the west of Ireland who did noti regard with abhorrence these proceedings of Mr. PoUock, as tending to depreciate the general character of Irish landlords, to disturb the peace, and to depopulate the country. (Hear, hear.) The statements in the petition were substantiaUy confessed, and a brother or friend of Mr. PoUock defended his conduct upon vague grounds of poUtical economy-that he desired to have tenants possessed of capital, who would improve the property and do good to themselves as weU as to the owner. Such conduct was altogether indefensible, and he asked the House to grant a committee to consider whether some means ought not to he adopted for the repression of proceedings of this kind. There were few members on either side of the Honse who had not condemned the practice of wholesale eviction. During a discussion upon the Crime and Outrage BUl of 1847, Mr. Horsman was reported to have said that if a hundredth part of snch injustice were done in ihis country he did not believe England would be governable for a week. (Hear.) Again, m 1S50, npon a motion for a special commission to mqnire into the state of the Kilrush Union, the right hon. gentleman said:" He had visited the union-during the recess, and he believed that if any peison had traveUed through Europe during his whole lifetime, he would never have witnessed so much misery arising from the same cause as he saw concentrated there in the course of a single week. . . . .Tt was aU very weU to speak of the ' rights of property,' bnt were there no rights of humanity or rights of life ? H they went to first principles, who would deny that property was for the benefit of all, not the few? There was no law which told human beings ihey should die in hundreds. Underthe circumstances in which they were placed, then, he thought they were justified in asking whether the cause of such museiy as was described should not be traced." {Setr.) When, therefore, the right hon. gentleman was on the Opposition side of the house itwas his opinion that these extraordiniiry circumstances onght tobe made the subject of investigation. He would slso refer to the authority of the Devon Com-jngtaoners in support of his proposition. When a gentlem-Tji purchased property in the Encumbered Estates Court, a-.a& found that i.few tenants were unable topay rent, r.o doubt he was entitled to exercise the nsual rights of property in dealing with them; but he had no right to ue&opulate whole districts-to clear away thousands of Her Majesty's subjects, (Hear, hear.) But this gentleman had ?already evicted about 5,000 people, and he now intended to depopulate npwards of 7,000acres. Inthe reign of Henry VTL an act was passed against eviction, which was then being carried to as great an extent in England as at the present time in Ireland, and it was foUowed by other statutes to the same effect in the reigns of Henry VHL, Mary, and Edward VL All those statutes had however been repealed except that of the 4th of Henry VIL, which was, therefore, stfll appHcable to Ireland. It had for centuries been part of the general poUcy of the country that landlords could not clear off the population for their own special benefit. Sir Mathew Hale declared that dimimshing the subjects of the Crown was a capital felony, and the same view was taken by Sir Edward Coke. In 1635, when the judges were going circuit, the Chancellor recommended that the offence of depopulation should be brought under the notice of the grand juries, and that the g-nalties provided by the law shonld be strictly enforced. nt the system was checked in England when the law of settlement was adopted. Iu the reign of Charles IL, JB a landlord cleared off his tenantry, the law of settlement obliged him to maintain them at his own expense; and from that time to the preaent there had been in England no such system of extermination as that which now existed in Ireland. He had vno donbt ihat means might easUy be devised to put an end to the practice in Ireland as well as in Englami If the English law of settlement were extended' to Ireland, and gentlemen like Mr. AUenPoUock compeUed to provide, by means of a poor-rate, for the maintenance of their evicted tenantry, they would hesitate before resorting to so harsh and cruel a measure. At present, when a district was laid waste, the inhabitants were driven into a distant workhouse, and the evictor did not pay a sixpence of poorrate ; but he could not so escape if some provision .were made that a poor-rate should be levied npon the wasted district, whether it contained inhabitants or not, or whether the person who pretended to be the owner was the real proprietor or not. There was another mode in which the system of extermination might be checked. In England, if a manufacturer required a number of policemen to protect his property, he was obUged to pay and clothe ihem at his own expense;_ bnt in Ireland the police was a militaiy force, maintained out of the national revenue. Why should gentlemen like Mr. AUen PoUock not be placed in the same situation as the English rnanufacturer? Various other means might be devised for putting a stop to evictions, and therefore he hoped the Govemment would not object to the institution of an inqiiiry. He concluded bymoving for a_ select committee to investigate the allegations of snch petition, and to consider the expediency of devising means for resta-aimng the wholesale depopulation of rural districts in Ireland. Mr. BELLEW, in rising to second the motion, said he was induced to do so partly because the petition to which aUusion had heen made proceeded from a portion of his constituents, and partly because, as an Irish landlord, he was anxious to state the opinions and feelings of the greater number, if not the whole, of his brother proprietors. He rose as much to vindicate the cause of the Irish landlands as to advocate that of the Irish people; because be did not believe that as a rule ihe landlords acted froin any iU feeling or want of consideration towards the people ; but rather from some misconception or other which it was difficult to explain. In ihe cqunty of Galway one lady, for example, evicted a large number of tenants because she believed them to be gplty of rank ribandism. These tenants having been evicted again took forcible possession, and they were sent for trial at the assizes; when the lady declared, owing to the mode in which the proceedings were conducted, that ihe law officers of ihe Crown were conniving at ribandism. Now, if this lady aUowed her mind to be so warped with respect to thelaw officers of the Crown, she might be in equal error with regard to her tenantry. (Hear.) Then, again, as to Mr. PoUock, he beUeved that that gentleman was not so much_ an Ul-conditioned, hard-hearted man as he was the victim, so to speak, of a misconceived passion for evictions/for Mr. PoUock evicted aU alike, rich and poor, and ;not only aUowed them the full value of everything npon their land, even to the poultry, but gave them something additional npon quitting. StiU he (Mr. BeUew) thought that the system of evictions could be supportedby none but such as were ignorant of the resources of the country. All experience was decidedly opposed to it; and in Greece, Rome, and England, in former days, it had been deemed to be, not only prejudicial in the highest degreo to the weUbeing of the country, but also siarongly provocative of crime. He hoped that there would proceed from both sides of the House such an expression of opinion as would induce the Governmenttograntthe cominittee which was asked for. (Hear, hear.) He could not forget the anxious faces of wives and mothers, who had walked 20 or 30 miles to the assize town to obtain a few hours' eariier possession of the fact. Whether they were destitute before Heaven, or for six months longer had a roof to cover them, in the name of humanity he appealed to the House and to the Government to grant this inquiry. (Hear.) Lord PALMERSTON said, he would not enter into the detailed arguments why, if the motion were persisted in, he should feel it his duty not to consent to the appointment of the committee. But he would shortly state that he thought it neither consistent withthe usual practice of Parliament nor with expediency that the Honse should appoint committees of inquiry into matters of this nature. (Hear, hear.) He begged, however, not to be understoodas, in any degree, differing from the opinions expressed by hon. gentlemen a; to the class affected by this motion. Undoubtedly, the population of Ireland was not greater than the fertUity and extent of the country wonld usefully maintain and employ. On the other hand, by accidental circumstances and a great variety of causes, that population was very injudiciouslydistributed, accumulatedin greatnumbers where the amount ought to be smaller, and wanting in numbers where, however large, thepopulationmight be advantageously employed. Although, unquestionably, gentlemen who held estates in many parts of the conntry where the accumulation of tenants was greater than was compatible with the improvement of the country possessed the right by law of clearing their estates, he did not think that in exercising that power they acted consistently with their own and the public interests. (Cheers.) No one disputed that it was impossible for a landlord to aUow a tenant to occupy a holding without paying a proper rent. (Hear, hear.) On the other hand, if tenants were made sensible that it would be to iheir interest to transfer themselves to another land, where there was greater demand for labour and greater scope for industry, and their landlords assisted them in doing so, the landlords would be acting not only generously, but in accordance with humanity. (Hear, hear.) Having said ihat much, he hoped the hon. gentlemen who made and seconded the motion would not think bi*n wanting in courtesy or underrating the interest of the question they had brought before the House if he moved that the House pass to the ordera of the day. His reason for doing so was, that they could not give proper attention to subjects which had no relation to the great and important question they were discussing last night. (Hear, hear.) The Househad entered upon a motion of no less importance than a vote of censure on the Government, and it was only fitting, the House should, one way or the other, come to ai early decision. (Hear.) He thought it trifling with a subject of such great importance if a matter totaUy unconnected with it were interposed in the progress of the debate, and therefore he begged to move that the House should now pass to the ordeis of the day. (Hear, hear.) Mr. G. MOORE said, the opinion expressed by the noble lord rendered it utterly unnecessary, that he should deliver ihe speech which he had intended. (A laugh.) He thanked thenoble lord for having expressed the opinion which itwas desired to eUcit from the House of Commons, and hoped the noble lord would substitute for his amendment that the system of wholesale evictions without cause or necessity, alleged to be attempted in some parts of Ireland, was inconsistent with the best interests of the State. (Hear.) Mr. E. ELLICE thoughtthe expression of opinion elicited, from the noble lord satisfactory, and strongly deprecated the atrocious proceedings which had given rise to the motion. Mr. DISRAELI quite agreed with the noble lord at the head ofthe Government that, considering the importance of ihe debate which had been -adjourned from yesterday to that day, it wouldbe inconvenient that any other subject should intervene and delay the resnmptionof that adjourned debate. He should have venturedto expressthat opinion before, had it not been for the peculiar nature of the subject which had been brought before the Honse by the hon. and learned gentleman, but, as he believed that the catastrophe which the hon. and learned gentleman wished to^ avert might ensue next July, and, as the noble lord couldnot give the hon. and learned gentleman a day for bringing ihe subject before the Honse, he thought that great indulgence should be shown tothe hon. and learned gentleman: in deference to the position in which he was placed. He thought that the hon. and learned gentleman must have been satisfied at the strong expression of feeling which bis statement had called forth upon both sides of the House, and that he must also feel* that it would be now hetter to accede to the motion of the noble lord, because the present was not an occasion upon which the subject could be calmly and dispassionately considered. The subject was one of great deliaacy, but he was certain that no one, whatever might be his opinion as to the general law, could have heard the statement ofthe hon, andlearned gentleman, or have listened to so painful a history, without arriving at the opinion that the exercise of rights under the law as described was most intolerable. (Hear, hear.) He had always felt that upon the whole the Encumbered Estates Court had been beneficial, but if there was anything which conld raise a prejudice against that court it would be that it gave to strangers who might even be non-resident the occasion for depopulating large districts. (Hear, hear.) He_ observed with great pleasure that it was not by a native of Ireland that it was aUeged that these outrages Eon common feeling had been committed. (Hear, hear.) * did not now pretend to give any opinion as to the specific motion. He hadfelt it fisduiy to makeihese observations, and he hoped that when the opportunity was afforded for discussing the subject it would be approached in a calm and dispassionate spirit. (Hear, hear.) At present, however, he felt that the proper course to pursue would be to agree to the motion of the noble lord, and proceed withthe adjourned debate on the faU of Kars. (Hear, hear.) Mr. J. FITZGERAD wished to observe that a short time back a letter had appeared in one of the daUy prints referring to these transactions, in which some blame was attributed to the law officers of the Crown, and he wished to give thatstatement a direct contradiction. SirM. S. STEWART thought that some of the expressions appUed to Mr. PoUock were -unfair. He had the pleasure of knowing Mr. Pollock, and he was in all respects a true gentleman and was generaUy respected. Mr. MAGUIRE said that the statements which had heen made by the hon. and learned gentleman had not been i founded upon txpdrte accounts, but upon a considerationoS both sides of the question. As to Mr. Pollock, he might bes, tnd no doubt was, * .good gentleman, bnt he was a very ba3 landlord. , ,-, Mr. M'MAHON said that, after what had faUen fittnt hon. gentlemen on both sides of the House, he would nofi oppose the amendment of the noble lord. The amendment of the noble lord was then agreed to, andl the House passed to the orders of the day. BANKERS COMPOSITIONS BILL. This fciU was read a third time *nd passed. THE FALL OF KARS. ADJOURNED DEBATE. Mr. J. G. PfflLLTMOKE said that, much as he udm&ea the abUity with which the hon, and learned member Sot Enniskillen, had introduced the subject of ihis debate, he could have wished that the hon. and learned gentleman -*$ chosen a more convenient opportunity for di^Uying rhitj great forensic powers. It might he a skilful «rtifice oa ihg part of an advocate to put aside all that iold against iim,' and to dweU upon every detached passage that was favour* able to his own views, but he did not think that that was ihe duty of a senator, more especially whea he was caUed upon to exercise functions of a. judicial nature. The hon. and learned gentleman entered with con« siderabledetaU into the conduct of Lord Clarendon, hut all the charges brought by ihe hon, and learned gentle. man against that noble lord were founded on entire misV representation. One aUegation was that CommisaoheS WiUiams was sent to U*ts without any ostensible character* The fact was that he wss sent out with aU ihe authority that theEnglish Government could confer upon him. Lord ClarenW don left no effort unexhausted to procure for General Williams that rank which he ought to have obtained £com the Turkish Govemment, and which, if he had obtained* would no doubt have enabled him to succeed in his object* Although helistened with the greatest attention tothe speed* of the hon. and learned gentleman, he could not discovejr any one specific measure which he considered the GoTern«ment ought to have adopted and which they had neglectei to do. The hon. and learned gentleman complained c£; the conduct of Lord Stratford de Redcliffe. Wasit the opinion of the hon. and learned gentleman ihafe. that able diplomatist should have been reeaUed? Con* sidering the perfect knowledge possessed by that noble lori of aU matters relating to Turkish affairs and his intimate acquaintance with the Turkish language and [the habits of tha people, it was not possible that any Minister, under the circumstances, could recaU him. With regaic" to the removal of ihe troops, he would ask whether the hon. aiid learned gentleman would seriously have recommendei that a single soldier should be Temoved from the main seat of the war^Sebastopol-in order that they might- be sent to Armenia'? The hon. and learned gentleman had referred to a despatch from Lord Pamnure,-in which he said that Lordt "Panmure had declared that the case of General Williamsi was desperate. Bnt tha.twasnot Lord Panmure's expression. The expression used by Lord Panmure was, that it woulj be madness to attempt to succour General Williams in the way suggested-not that his case was desperate. Lord Clarendon showed great discretion in deprecating tha course which Omar _ Pasha proposed to take, and not only* General WiUiams, but even General Mouravieff, concurred with him. There could be no doubt that the final cause o£ the surrender of Kars was the cowardice of Selim Pasha, and the conduct of Lord Stratford in endeavouring to shield him from the consequences of his misconduct was highly censurable. General WiUiams and Mr. Brandt referred to his cowardice upon more than one occasion, and, even at tha last moment, if he had made a proper use of the feoops under his command Kars wouldhavebeen saved. Uponwhat ground, then, was a censuretobe-passed uponLord Clarendon, who had throughout shown the most anxions desire to assist General Williams in every way ? The noble lord the member for Colchester (Lord J. Manners) said that no misconducfc could be imputed to Lord Stratford after an early period oE these transactions. Bnt as early as the 20th of January, 1855, General Williams wrote, imploring Lord Stratford toobtain for bim the appointment of Ferikand the directorship of the suppUes, and on the 1st of May he was obliged to repeat his request, because, as he said, he had not thea received a line rn allusion to it from his lordship. Thisletter alone proved that Lord Stratford's misconduct could haTdly he exaggerated, and yet they were asked to pass ifeover in order to censure Lord Clarendon, The hon. and learned gentleman, after he had. dwelt upon Lord Stratford's misconduct, stated that from the moment his quarrel with General WiUiams was at an end his lordship acted with zeal and energy. But what proof did the hon. and learned gentleman give of that assertion ? When did Lord. Stratford's quarrel withthe general end ? It was hnpossiblato conceive greater difficulties than those with which*. General WiUiams had to contend, and Lord Stratford had no excuse for leaving unanswered the numeroua and pressing letters in which General Williams asked for assistance to enable him to overcome those difficulties. Why shonld it have been necessary for General Williams toadopt the circuitous course of applyingto Lord Clarendon-to entreat our ambassador to use his influence with the Porta, in his behalf ? Nothing could have been more natural than that Lord Clarendon, in his indignation at Turkish apathy, should have uttered the stern iebuke which his despatch. to Lord Stratford adirdnistered io ihe Turkish Ministersviz., thai they had never ceased praying for the success of the brave men whom ihey took no active measures to reUeve. The State papers of our Foreign Minister weremodels of firmness, dignity, and clearness. The real question, however, which it was impossible to evade, wa-jwhat would have been the result if General WiUiams had received proper support from his first entrance on hisfunctions? The blue-book contained abundant proof that nothing had been wanting on the part of the Government at home-that Lord Clarendon had done aU that energy and foresight could achieve. Unfortunately, it also furnished evidence, only too ample, that our ambassador had neglected his most obvious duty. The country asked why heroic efforts, like those of General WiUiams, deserving of -victory, had only ended in disaster? H such a result had been owing solely to adverse fortune it might have been quietlyendured ; or had it been the consequence of an isolated act of imprudence or indiscretion the error mighthave been overlooked in consideration of the past services of its author. But if, on tiie other iand, it was traceable to an indulgence in vindictivafeeling, caprice, or personal hostility, it richly deserved to be visited with some signal mark of national indignation. It was impossible to persuade any reasonable man that Lord Clarendon was obnoxious to blame and Lord Stratford entitled to be exonerated. A declaration on. the part of that assembly that Lord Clarendon had shown liimself deficient in zeal and dUigence would only haparaUeled by ihe factions vote of the |House of Commons which impeached the great Lord Somers. Let the general feeling of disapproval of the conduct of our ambassador at Constantinople, evinced in the course of that debate, hava its proper weight and effect, but he (Mr. Phillimore) would not stand between the Ministers of the Crown and tho majority which, if the House were not transported by party -violence beyond the bounds of reason, they had a fair right to expect. - He would not help ia shield from defeat those who, to heap unjust reproaches oa men who had faithfuUy served their Sovereign under tha most trying circumstances, had not scrupled to prefer accu* sations that were contradicted by the very general whosafate they professed to deplore. Mr. KER SEYMER said, he was aware thatwhen two parties were drawn up in .lostile array,. and the affray had already begun, any one who should interpose between the combatants, and advise them to lay aside their weapons and return home, if not in peace, atleast without finishing their battle, might be undertaking n. very thankless task. That task, however, he was himselE now about to perform; for he intended to move, as a*i amendment to the motion before the House, the omission oE aU the words after the word "Kara," in order to insert thsfoUowing:-"It (the House) is of opinion that it ia not expedient to offer any judgment upon the causes and consequences of the capitulation of that fortress until the House has had the opportunity of considering; the terms of the treaty of peace and the protocols of tha conferences recently held at Paris now laid upon the table.'1 He proposed to enable the House to vote on this amendment. He entirely concurred in the first part of the motion of tha hon. and learned gentleman, believing it impossible to estimate too highly the merits of General Williams and his brave associates. Having traveUed through ihe country which was the scene of tho war, and held communication with the Turks, perhaps he would be aUowed to state a few of the peculiar difficulties there encountered. The amount of peculation among the higher order of Turkish offioers was almost incredible, and the difficulties with which General WiUiams had to contend at Erzeroum and Kars, at the commencement of his career, were nearly inconceivable. The blue-book showed ihat one Pasha mada 30,000?. sterling by robbing the soldiers for a long period o£ a meal of nee twice a week, and another was foiinddrawing rations for nearly 30,000 men, whUe on the muster-roU only 13,000 or 14,000 actuaUy appeared. The apathy and procrastination of a Turkish official were almost beyond beUef. The traveUer had to drink the Lord knew how many cups of muddy coffee and smoke au infinite number of pipes before he could get sucli a personage to proceed to business. (laughter.) When he did get to business he soon grew tired of 5, and. his answer invariably was, " Please God, we wiU see abont it to-morrow." (Laughter.) In fact, there were no hounds to the procrastinations of the Pashas; and their universal maxim was never to do to-day what could be put off till to-morrow. (Laughter.) It wa3 disheartening to have to do with such men; yet General WiUiams -was continually in contact with them, and he had an additional source of discouragement in the thought that he had been abandoned by one who ought to have stood firmly by him-the Queen's ambassador at Constantinople. However ihe facts of tha case might be, appearances were certainly such as to warrant that suspicion; but amid aU their dangers and difficulties General WiUiams aad his comrades presented a valiantfrbnt to the foe, and when the starving garrison was at length, compeUed to lay down arms and to march captive into tha Russian camp, they, though vanquished, had earner! for ihemselves such a meed ef glory as. few con« querors have the happiness to achieve. The conduct of tha Russians was equally honourable to their valour and humanity. Their perseverance in continuing to besiege tha fortress after they had sustained a signal def eat was credit* able to them as soldiers, whUe their kindness to those whom the fortune of war had thrown upon their mercy reflected the highest honour on them as men. Their commissariat, too, appeared to have been in a state of efficiency ihat con« feasted very favourably with our own in the Crimea,' (hear, hear), arid that it shonld have been so at such a season of tho year was not a Kttla remarkable, for the severity of the winter in thosa regions might be inferred from the fact that at Midsummer he had jumself seen, snow on the hUlsthat overlook Erae«

The pianoforte playing of Madame Schumann attracted the same degree of attention as at the previous concert, and her,success with theaudience was equally great. Her conception of .Mendelssohn's fine concerto was poetical and deeply interesting; but that which charmed us more in the performance, and which Madame Schumann gave with the most perfect finish, was the slow movement. We have listened to nothingmore exquisite than this. No singer, however gifted, could surpass it. The liquid beauty of Madame Schumann's tone (when she touches the instrument without effort), united to the unaffected grace and tenderness of her expression, e-ercised an indenable spell upon her hearers; and when the last notes were struck a feeling of regret wtas engendered, as at the fading of some pleasant keldrcn. The allegzro and finale were much lees satisfactory. At the end of the concerto-the most difficult ever written, to sustain with unflagging energy throughout-Madame Schumann was applauded with enthnsiasm. Both the svmphonies went reniarkably well, under the direction of Professor Bennett-Beethoven's Pastorale especially. Tho minueto in Mozart's G minor was encored. It would be superfluous to say anything in praise of such universally acknowledged master-pieces, The overtures, in theirway just as finespecimens of the genius of their composers, were quite as fortunate. In shor, so far as the instrumental miusic was coneerned-and instrumental music is the avowed object of the Philharmonic concertsa hapier choice or a better execution, allowing for some few |veryfew) discrepandes, could hardly have been desired by subscribers". A qenasi novelty among the vocal Pieces was the aria di brarra1 of Grann-a monotonous aerses of fiorid passages, spun out to tedious prolixity-which, notwithstauding the marveUlous fluency of Madame Viardot's execution, presented but a sorry notion of dramatic music in the middle of the last century. The Italian Opera must have been decidedly slow at that period. The melodious duet from Spohr's Fanat (what a difference between this and Graun !) is not well suited to Madame Viardot's voice, although it is familiar to Herr Formes. How Herr Formes sings the mnsic in Mozart's Seragqlio is niatter of notoriety.

LONMDO2, WEDA'ESDAY, APRIL 30, 15. ._---- b In the Rouse of Lords yesterday, Lord AVEAND (Sir GnEsRT HEMAOcOT) took the oaths and subscribed the Parliamentary rolL The Royal assent vas given by commission to the Exchequer-bills Bill (2l,lS2,7OOz.) and several private acts. The floyal Comnmissioners were tho L2o11D CaAscxJOP, the Duke of An~AGL, and Lord MIOxTAGLE. The Earl of ELLEMBOROUGH presented a petition from the merchants and bank-ers of London, and the Association of the Australian Colonies, praying for the speedy establishment of a postal communication with Anstralia. The Bishop of ExEmTEi subnmtted that some national testimony of thankfulness for the restoration of peace should be offered; he suggested that increased facilities for attending Divine worship should be given to the people; at present great numbers of them were without the means of attending public worship on the Sabbath. Vhile that was the case it was a mockery to prevent their going to plaes of public enjoyment on that day. Lord, RBDBSDALE, in presenting a petition from Mr. SCorr, who had been engaged in the inspection of the ventilation of the House, complaining he had been dismissed from the office he held on the understaudingit watz for life, again called attention to the cae of the fire brigade, -hicdh had been discharI for the purpose of appoinig other personsin the1r placea. He believed the House 'would not beSi.- safe under the ner arrangement as under the old. - The Duke of Sosxar again asertea that the' House had been endangered on one occasion by the divided authority; the excuse -was tha: the fire aose an X part of the building that was not completed; but he suppo it never would be completed ! Lord Swazyof .AnDRnIEY stated that the entire responsibility for the safety of the building been transferred to the Chief Commissioner of the Board of. Works, and the House oug"ht not to nterfere to lessen it. The Earl of MALrMrISR withdrew his notice of motion (for Friday next) relative to the fall of Kams. He did so with great regret; but several delays had taken place; the Earl of CLARmmo?N- had been detaied in Paris three weeks longer than had been expected; the Treaty of Peace had been laid on the table, and this had completely altered the state of affairs. The House was invited to discuss the Treaty on Mionday next, and it was imposible to enter on the transactions connected with the war in Asia Minor without anticipating that discussion. He should therefore reserve the observations hehad to make, for the debate on the Treaty. He asked if the exact form of the address to the CRowr-Nwould be laid on the table before Monday. Earl GiuNvnTa promised that the House should hve previous notice of the terms of the motion. The Mercantile Law Amendment Bills (England and Scotland) went through committee. The House then adjourned. Ia the House of Commons some questions put to Sir B. HA.T by the Marquis of BraNFOxn elicited. information respecting the. arrangements contemplated w-ith reference to the performance of the military binds in the public parks on Sundays. Mr. L. KING obtained leave to bhing in a bill to repeal certain statutes which are sleeping and not in Use. fIr. 'INir ox called attention to the subjectmatter of a petition from certain inlabitants of the parishes of Kilbegnet and Ballynakill, in the oumty of Galway, presented last year, and moved for the: appointment of a select committee to investigate its allegations. He stated the particulars of the case, *which related to the "c learance" by an Irish landlord of the tenantry on an estate which he had purchased in the Encumbered Estates Court. His object, he said, was to devise means for restraining the depopulation of rural districts in Ireland, and he suggested some expedients by which this abuse of a right might be checked. The miotion was seconded by Mr. BErLaTv, who strongly urged the impolicy, as well as cruelty, of these wholesale clearances, and called upon the Government, in the name of humanity, to grant this inquiry. Lord PAIMUSTON- admitted that the labouring population of Ireland was not greater than its wants required, though it was injudiciously distributed; but, although there were many parts of the country in which the accumnulation of labour was greater than was compatible with the interests of tne tenantry themselves, he thought those who exercised the right belong,ing to them of clearing their estates did not act consistently with the public interests. Considering, however, that the House was in the middle of the discussion of an important question, he suggested that this subject should be deferrea to another opportunity, and he moved that the House do pass to the orders of the day. Mr. DISRAELT concurred in this course, and, after some further discussion, this amendment was agreed to. The Whichwood Forest Bill passed through conimittee. The Bankers' Compositions Bill was read a third time and passed. The adjourned debate on the fall of Ears was resumed by iMr. J. P B Buro, who had given notice of an amendment to Mr. WHUrSIDIe's motion, which he did not, however, move. Hebeganby insisting upon the injustice of the attack made upon Lord CAusENDON by Mr. WnnH1Es, who had not, he said, indicated any specific measure which he wished the Government to have adopted. Sebastopol, Mr. PInmLLoxrE argued, was the main object to 'which the operations of the allies was and should have been directed, and no Milnister could have recommended that a part of the forces should have been sent into Armenia for a subordinate purpose. Mr WnHrBsrnE had condemned Lord C1:ARnxioN for disapproving the route chosen by OshA PASHA for relieving Ears, but if Lord CL-_ RENDoN erred in this he erred, not only with General WinaaSxs hinself, but with General MoUxAviE.'s. The misconduct of Lord STAurFOnn, 'which could hardly, he said, be exaggerated, continued so late as 3May 1, as appeared from a letter fiom General Wmmavis of that date, complaining of neglect upon a vital point. Independent of his silence, the conduct of the Ambassador, he contended, was utterly indefensible. The blue-book containea abundant evidence that nothing had been wanting in the Governmnent at home; that all that foresight and energy could do was done by Lord CL".NDoN,, while there was equal evidence that his most obvious duties had been neglected by our Ambassador at the Porte. hIr. K. SExi R moved, as an amendment to the imotion, to insert after the word " Ears" in the resolution an. expression of the opinion of the House " that it is not expedient to offer any judgment as to the causes and the consequences of the capitulation of the fortress till the House had an opportunity of considering the terms of the Treaty of Peace and the Protocols of the Conferences recently held at Paris." Since the original motion had been announced, he observed, considerable changes had taken place; the Treaty of Peace and the Protocols had been laid upon the table of the House, and a larger question was now before itnamely, the effect of the fall of Kars upon the Peaco Conferences. That eventmight have enabled Russia to treat for the cession of captured places on the footing of an ex;change, but it might also turn out that it had had an important effect upon the peace, and that 'we had obtained on that account worse terms. He asked whether such an overwhelming case had been made out against lHx MA.TsTs's Government as to induce the Hlouse, before it knew the real effect of the fall of Ears upon the Conferences, to rush to the conclusion of a vote of cen- sure. The CHsASCLxon of the Exns:QULM said much of the speech of Mr. NVx3rrssrn was irrelevant as directed against HEB Ms3sxsr's Government. The only ground of his attack was connected with the appointment of General W=iA31s as our Comniissioner with the Turlish axmy. Our Government had, he said, attached more importance to the operations in Asia 3inor thani the French; but the heart and centre of the power of Rissia in that region was acknowledged by both to be Sebastopol, not Armenia. That was the - main object of the allies, and it would have been higahly impolitic, and contrary to mility principles, to withdraw troops from Sebastopol t secure a purely secondary object. In amilitary point of view, therefore, it was imupossible to attach importance to the loss of Ears; but it might be said that it wvas of great importance in a Dolitical view; that it placed in the hands of Ruissia an acquisition which rendered our position leo favourable at the Conferences. But the Protocols would show that a plan of pacification had been agreed upon by the three Governments of Austria, France, and England, and put into writing before the capture of Kars; and, comparing those preliminmries with the treaty of peace, he. defied any one to show that it fell short in any respect of the preliminary articles. On the contrary, the treaty went beyond the preliminariesm If this was so, could any man capable of reasoning say with truth that the capture of Ears lhad any political importanceI te denied that we had malade any concession for the restoration of Ears. 4fter various explanations respecting the advances of the loan, ,and defending the Government with -reference to the supply of money to Turkey, he remarked that the amendment, which amounted in effectto moving the previous question, bore a strong family likenens to a motion of which notice had been given by the Earl of MArrssnny in the House of Lords, but which had been abandoned. The Government, he uaid, were most desirous that this question should be fully discussed and sifted; they courted the decision of the House upon the original motion, and he could not, thererore, support an amendment which merely postponed the question. He maintained that there was sufficient evidencerbefore the House to justify it in pronouncing an aquittal of the Government. 5ir J. PFAxRTcmox, notwithstanding the speech
The metropolis yesterday wvitnessed a ceremony which, considering it is forty years since a previous recurrence, and the gates of JsA.us had never been closed on a grander occasion, might have been invested with some dignity and splendour. It is something that the West is no longer at war -with the East, that the people and treasure of the fairest quarter of the world are no longer heaped on a continual hecatomb, and that commerce is no longer supplanted oy the messengers of destruction. But the ceremony of yesterday was true to the old English type, so well-knovn at Spithead, at the DuKE7s funeral, at Balaldava, at all our rejoicings and mournings, our grandest achievements, and our worst disasters. It was meagre, motley, slovenly, and too late. 'Th epeople at Charing-cross had to wait an hour and a half before they sa-w first a troop of those redoubtable Horse Guards whom experience is fast -divesting of all military character. Then followed trumpeters and druunmers, and a multitude of parish beadles; then, on troopers' horses and deep in sheepskins, a number of elderly gentlemen, lookoing exceedingly out of their place in thie most gorgeous heraldic costumes. Then some singularlooking young men in black, with immense white favours, and on white horses. Among these dis-cordant elements there moved about sundry *civilian and very unofficial-looking personages, -who gave what little order there was to the procession. As they had all assembled only at the moment when they ought to have started, and had then to hold a Cooucil of WVar to -consider what -was to be done, the w hole traffic of the chief artery of the metropolis was stopped, -and some hlindred thousand people kept in sweet -expectation, as we have said, the better part of the forenoon. The Proclamation, of course, wa3 not heard, for official documents are never read above -the lowest conversational tone. One always fancies -the readers saying aside to the people, " You'll " find it all in the papers to-mortow." The whole looked a rough outline, which the imagination of -tlhe spectators was to fill up. Yet, though it -certainly was an appeal to the good nature of she populace, the appeal was successful; and when -the Proclamation had been read in dumb show, -when the trumpets souncded, and the cannon wvere heard, the people were more than satisfied. They --aw that Vwe had actually PEACE. It had been sigued, sealed, and delivered, and there was no Miistake. We do all our forms in a slovenly way, ;and the slovenliness of the ceremony made it the mnore authentic. By this time people have well- I migh forgotten the sores that Welre raldfing eveu. -two slort months ago,-the Redan, the hope Of revenge, the open field, the one more campaign. Wahey have reason to be satisfiedl with the terms -which our diplomatists hJae battled for anl won. ypi ing returns, and wita it all the arts of peace, no 1nger hindered or perverted by war. We are, indUed, summing up what we have suffered and lost, but it is because we now know the worst. At the bottom of this satisfaction is a feeling founded in fact, and not to be shaken by all the sophistry of faction, that our part in the war was inevitable andt righteous, and that, though we may not have won the glory we desired, we have yet done our work, and put on a securer basis the liberties, not only of one decrepit State, but of all Europe, and, indeed, of the wliole world. The story of these two years has been anxious and terrble; but it is the u ork of a century. For a century the workhas accumulated, but wse have wiped it off in two years; hos it matters not; at least bravely and nobly, if not skilfully. But is England, and are the other great States of Europe, always to go on allowing evils to ripen till they are past all endurance, or till they breal; out themnselves into- conflagration ? An Almighty POwEit, for inscrutable purposes, may suffer the measure of a nation's iniquity to be fulfilled till it calls for extermination. But mortal rulers cannot calculate so long, so surely, or so safely to themselves. Unquestionably there are national evils in the continent of Europe whlich are gradually coming to a pass,-dangerous not merely to the nations themselves or thleir neighbours, but to all Europe. The condition of Greece and that of Italy are no more purely Grecian and Italian questions than the condition of Turkey was a purely Turkish 'question. 'Naples and the States of the Church are volcanoes only dormant so long as a tremendous pressure is applied from without, that pressure itself being, to say the least, anomalous and hurtful to the true interests of all Europe. The internal evils that have called for that pressure cannot heal under it, but are rather aggravated than otherwise. The secular population of Rome will never love a sacerdotal rile better because it is forced on them by the bayonets of France, nor will the Legations get over their dislike - to Cardinals because they are associated with Germans and Croats. No doubt, even Austrians are better than anarchy, and sentinels than assassins; but whatever lies under the surface is neither removed nor cured by the mask of a foreign despotism. It only festers below. There is not a State in Italy, under whatever of its complicated and varied conditions, which does not tremble on the eve of convulsion. That convulsion will hardly fail to draw in ourselves and the other leading States of Europe. We are, by a prescription which is not yet broken, by promises not yet forgotten, and by an example wllich we cannot hide if we would, the fiiends and patrons of Italian liberty. WVe have the glory and the shame of that position. Ve cannot elude the responsibility. In one way or another evely other great State is also interested, more or less directly, in the condition of Italy; some by religion, others by political affinity; two by actual intervention, folmded not only on religion, but on historical relations. This hold on the interest of all Europe is only a tradition of the times when Rome was the mistress of the world, and when her Senates scrutinized otur position as we now do hers. The affinity is changed, but not destroyed. Rome still claims as her own millions of our countrymen, and boasts more subjects in this metropolis than in her own. Within a very few years she has shaken tthe allegiance of a third part of these realms. Even the internal peace of this country is involved in a correct solution of the Italian problem, and a just division of ecclesiastical and secular authority. A pretension which. cannot maintain itself without foreign arms is iot a safe element to enter into our own social state, even though our alliance with that foreign aid be stronger than our sympathies with the object of its suipport. I It was, then, a very natural corollary of the Treaty that the Plenipotentiaries should come to some kind of conunon understanding as to the treatment of these secondary States, in which all Europe is interested, and which, unfortunately, invite or provoke interference. From Turkey the transition was almost necessary to Greece, now occupied by the Western Powers, and thence to Italy, also under foreign occupation. The Plenipotentiaries, indeed, all acted their parts on this subject with dramatic fidelity. The Russian cordially agreed in hoping that the condition both of Greece and Italy would soon be so far improved as to dispense with foreign aid; otherwise, he had no inst-ructions, and could not commit his master. The Austrian was glad to hear that the Western Powers wished to leave Greece alone as soon as possible, and as for the Legations and other encroaclhments in Italy, was content to leave the sublject in the hands of France, and even of Sardlinia. France saw a great difference between a small and distant intervention invited by the Sovereign himself, and invasion by a powerful neighbour in the face of a protest. The Sardinian spoke with great courage and freedom, but without the burden of an extensive responsibility. In the face of a coldness which approached to irony, the British Plenipotentiary persevered in asling for some expression of opinion as to the condition of the Italian States, and on the whole subject of armed intervention. He had, indeed, to put his ideas into the most general form, for the French Plenipotentiary could assent to nothing which threatened to restrict a State in the assertion of its own dignity, and the Austrian 'would not commit himself to any respect for defacto Governments, and anticipated some unpleasantness from the discussion of these topics. Lord CLAREi?n1o! had to shape his proposal so as to rnm the gauntlet of these objections, and the result, considering the difficulties, is no small success. " The " Plenipotentiaries did not hesitate to express in the "name of their Governments the wish that States "between which anyserious misunderstanding may "arise should, before appealing to arms, have "recourse, as far as circumstances might allow, "to the good offices of a friendly Power." Though this be only a principle of common humanity, such as mulst natturally occur to every ordinary statesman, yet its express recognition by a European Congress gives it new weight, and constitutes the ground of an appeal by every State from any other State that disregards it. It makes all Europe one court of appe.d. It gives every weak State a claim to the friendly Offices of all its stronger neighbours. Indeed, it is the nearest approach to that system of universal arbitration which some thought attainable in its rigorous form. The day may come vhen its value vill be more acknowledged and its form more defined; and the sooner it comes the better for the happiness of Europe and the true interests of every State, however powerful and ambitious.
In the House of Lords last evening Lord ALMEMSBPUY withdrew his motion on the fall of Kars. Siuch a proceeding was, of course, to be eI pected. Precedent; as well as the spirit of modern politics, makes the House of Commons the great tribunal before which statesmen must answer. A debate in the Lords on Friday would be useless and undignified after a decision by the more popular assembly on Tuesday. But the withdrawal of the subject from the notice of the Upper House can hardly have afforded much encouragement to the assailants who followed Mflr. WnITrxsnx's leadership. The oratory of the Opposition last night was tame comparedc -vith the invectives of the opening address. Indeed, Mr. _xzni2 seems to have exhausted not rily all the matter, but all the energy of his party. The two great charges against the Government,that they did not dismiss Lord STEATFoRn, and that they did not send the Turks quickly enough from the Crimea to Kars,-are echoed by the Opposition speakers, though with no confident utterafice. Before Sir J. PAu GTo.N rose to speak, however, Mr. PH=raosRE had withdrawn one amendment, and Mfr. Exn SFEvnmE had proposed another. The latter was to the effect, that "it was not expedient to offer any "judgment on the capitulation- of the fortess till "the House had an opportunity of considering the " terms of the Treaty of Peace and the Protocols " of the Conferences recently held at Paris." This was, in fact, a moving of the previous question, and does not seem to have been received with much favour by either side. The CmaNcELion of the Exc!rEQuER thought that the fall of Kars had little effect on the negotiations, and miglht therefore be disregarded. This is, we think, hardly making the best of a good cause; and, if the defence of the Government could be based on no better foundation, it v ould indeed be in a bad case. Sir J. PAKINGT62 thoought'Lord STRATFoRD was much in fault, but that the Ministers were far worse; and Mr. LAYArJD attributed the fall of Kars to the conduct of Lord A DEraEx's Administration three: years ago, and- considered the present Government as only in a smnall degree in fault. In fact, there were nearly as many opnions as. men, and this inability to fix any definitely oulpable act on the Government does not show much for the cause of the Opposition. The House seems to have been unable to endure a fenewed military discussion, and tho quantity of detail inflicted on it was consequently less,. but there was little brought forward that can be called new, and less that can be considered interesting. The probability of one or even two more nights' debate on this already exhausted question can hardly be contemplated without anxiety by any one who is solicitous for the despatch of public business. From the division on the motion for adjournment it is plain that the Government have a majority, and that the Opposition will gain nothing by a prolongation of the conflict. We may now therefore look on tlhis subject as finally determined. That it fully deserved the examination of Parliament and the nation no one can doubt. The mere fact that the British officers who bore the chief part in the defence conceived themselves to have, been injured was sufficient ground for the publication of all that related to the event. The world is now acquainted -with the matter to its smallest details, and we think that neither the Govelnment nor the people of England have cause to regret that mystery no longer shrouds these past events. Of the more deplorable part of the transaction we shall speak no more. The universal feeling of the Houise of Commons has only confirmed the verdict which society in general has pronounced. The rest is for the Government, on whom lies the responsibility of retaining or dismissing its agents abroad. Of any wilful negligence, or want of sufficient energy and foresight, the Ministers must fairly stand acquitted, but we cannot entirely agree with the CHAL;Ron of the :ExcnEQlER, who deelares that the fall of Kars has been productive of no evil effects at all. Sir GEORGE LEwis argues that, as the plincipal conditions of peace were settled before the disaster in Armenia became known, Russia can have received no benefit. Yet, it may be reasonably said that the gain of the last victory in the war placed the CzAR on terms of equality with his opponents, and has given him a position not without influence in past negotiationg, nor likely to be powerless for the future. It is, indeed, a moral advantage, a recovery of lost prestige, which has accrued to Russia by the hard-won triumph of November. But such benefits are a real solid gain, and not the less so among semi-barbarous races prone to exaggeration and wonder. In the affair of Kars the Russians will be their own historians, and they will have willing and credulous listeners. Every caravan which carries the merchandise of the west to the cities of Central Asia will tell of the great victory achieved over the Turks, supported by the arms of the rulers of India. It may not be much that Persia or Bokhara can do against us, but we must be content to know that in the minds of despots of different degree our opponents have been raised above us by the events of the late campaign. Far be it from any man of common sense and courage to talk again of a Russian march to the Indus. That vision, the most baseless that ever haunted the timid politician, must now, we think, be for ever dissipated. Europe has now had some experience of war in uncivilized lands. It knows how much is required for a march even of a few miles through a friendly territory, and with po-werful and unopposed navies in the rear. That any armies which a CZAR can ever raise should sweep over 2,000 miles of steppe and desert, rock and pathless forest, to the confines of British power now seems a notion which ignorance and terror could alone entertain. Yet Russia may still be not incapable of annoyance. Our relations with thewhole East are every day extended. Enterprise will more and more find its way to. regions which have now almost a fabulous sound in European ears. Here our influence will, no doubt, be combated by diplomacy directed from St. Petersburg, and in the struggle of interests we may be not unfrequently reminded that in the last passage of aris which those regions witnessed our own star sank before that o' our rival. These considerations have had a great part in creating the anxiety with which this discussion has been awaited. It has been felt, both by Englishmen and their allies, that with the Asiatic war we are especially concerned. A general anticipation has arisen that in those regions, now so indistinctly known, the two empires which divide the supremacy of Asia should one day meet in hostility. Such a feeling may be baseless, and the predictions founded on it likely to be forgotten; butj it has prevailed so extensively that the voice of the world has connected the defence of Armenia with the duties of the British nation. On the whole, those duties have been not unworthily performed. British offlcers have, after the example of former times, shown their special capacity for commanding Asiatics. Two cities were within a fewv months fortified by British sill, and not only has the province been held with resolution, but it has been shown how it can at any timne be defended again. In fact, Anatoia has been shown to be as difficult of conquest as Central Asia. When we recollect at what a cost of life, time, and money Kars was won, we may congratulate ourselves on the security of the Turkish empire in Asia. The march to Constantinople, though lately the terror of statesmen, is showvn to be as much a dream as thle march to Calcutta. )Wile, then, we rcognize how much has been lost by the disaster which has been debated, we cannot believe that the gallantry of our officers and the exertions of our Governments have been in vain. It would have been better if Kars had been held till an armistice relieved it, but still we may be prouid of its five months' defence, and sure that such prowess wi not be without results. The failuxoa winl, we trust, be soon effaced ;--the heroismnwh,eh deserved, but could.not command succems, wi endure for ever.
Lord CAIGA hm been far wiser in his generation than Lord Lvc&w, It may be that the exa,ple of his late comnniander has not been thrown away upon him. Had Lord. Luc" confined himself to a; short counter-statement to the report of the Comrissioners, and examined a fewa writnesses with as much temper and dignity as he could command,. and, above all, as briefly as possible, his affairs would not have been in so hopeless a position as at present. Lord, CARDIGosi, we say, has been wiser; lhe has made a 'better defence, and he has not called public attention -with so nuch force to the weak points of his case. He cannot, indeed, deny the siibstantial truth of the statements made by the Commissioners, but he re-fvrs the sufferings of the remains of !he Light Brigade to the exigencies of the service. According to Lord COaDIGA'IN, Lord RAGLANl had been persuaded by the French General to place the remains of the Light Brigade in a position in which tiheir destrtuction by famine was ineiitable. Lord CARDiaAN' remonstrated, but Lord MToGis-N shrank from violating his promise. "U Upon iny suggesting to "Lord RAGLAN the severity of the exposure and "other difficulties," says' Lol CARDIGAN, "w hvich "almost rendered it impossible for 'the Brigade to remain in that positioni, I gatthered from Lord "RAGLAz's reply that he was privately pledged to "the French General to keep the. cavalry there !" It is needless to say that, like the other Crimean officers in high command, Lord CARDixaa> makes the -most of the great storm in November. CALnis BALDEnSTONE never tulrned tlie great fire to better- account for the honour of the family. We find, however, that he admiits the representations of the Comnmissioners-he admits that a day or two after he resigned the c6mmiand' the few wretched' 'animals which yet survivedstaggered and fell dead in large_proportion, as their riders vainly endeavouredto lead thein down from. the heights. WVe find, in a word, the truth of the statements made by the Commissioners as to the condition of the Brigade admitted, but for the 'life of us we cannot find, upon his own showing, what Lord CAloDIOAN did to diminish the sufferings of horse or rider. Nor, to take Lord CADiGAx's case upon its own merits, as he conducted it himself, did Lord CAuDIGAN even make out the point that the difficulties of the situation were insuperable. True, that in the end the horses were too weak to be sent for forage, but why? Because they had not been sent in time. " Sending down the horses for forage " vould have been practicable at first," said Colonel Domrrv, " but not afterwards, because "the horses were so weak and in such bad con"dition that they could not have performed "the journey there and back, and brought forage "with them." Colonel Do=meTy also told thie Court yesterday that he had not made personal application to send his horses for forage, because he had been informed by other. commanding officers that they had been refused permission to do so. Lord CAuDIG-ioN, in short, could make nothing of his case, for nothing is to be 'made of it; but he did not make it worse by siunmoning disingenuous witnesses to his aid, and by indulgoing in violent and unprovoLed vituperation against zealous and honourable servants of the C-RowN. In so far he stands in honourable contrast to Lord 'L c4s.x. This valiant General has at length made his great speech. We find in it a strong eulogium of his own surpassing nierits, a hearty depreciation of any officer who may have ven.ured to challenge his zeal, ability, or discretion, and a distortion in nearly every particular of what Colonel Tuir;ocn has asserfed in the course of the inquiry. With all this, Lord LOcAN is very angry with all persons out of doors who have dared to make any comment upon the evidence of his own witnesses. We, however, remain of opinion that there are other parties to this investigation than the accused or accusing officers and the Crimean Commissionersnamely, the people of England, and that they, too, have a right to be heard. We have intrusted our treasure -and the far more precious blood of our heroic sons to incompetent guidance. If what we have affirmed throughout, and what we still believe, be the truth, many hundreds, nay, many thousands of English homes have been made desolate, and the greatest opportunity for raising the English name to pre-eminent glory among the nations has been lost, by the professional iacompetence-by the " want of promptitude and ingenuity," of the English officers in high command. True that the Engrlish soldier conquered in the long run-true that neither famine nor disease, neither watching nor fatigue, neither assault nor surprise, could quell his untameable courage. Never did England send forth from her shores an army like that which landed in the Crimea, and at the bayonet's point, each iuan thrusting on his way for himself, crowned the heights of the Alma, drove before them the intrenched Russians, and marched straight to Sebastopol, but not into itfor they were withheld. Two months afterwards a dismal scene commenced, the most sorrowful yet the most glorious in our military annals. Week after week the British regiiments melted away in the midst of fearful sufferings; but in their dimination, as in their strength, they enclosed the fire of one-half of the beleaguered city, and at the same time upon them, and them alone-for such was the unwise decision of the General-was thrown the task of guarding the common camp and of keeping the military power of that vast Russian empire at bay. Need we sDeak of-the surprise of that morning in Novemberwhen the British soldiers, with little aid indeed from their supeliors, started to their feet and saved the allied armies from inglorious defeat ? These things are now half forgotten. Who speaks now of the protracted' agony of the trenches, from which the pale, overstrained, starving Englishmen issued forth half-adozen times in a night, like a thin line of ghosts, and with the death-grip on their firelocks contrived still to hurl back the foe, although when the task was accomplished they could scarce regain the shelter they had left? All honour to their memory ! W19hile a drop of British blood leaps in the hearts of their countrymen the tale of the glory and of the sufferings of these men Will never be uttered but with 'bated breath and amid thickcoming fancies of the degree -which Britislh heroism may attain. All was against them-all,-but the tas'k set before them they performed. With respect to l, ord LvcAiw, let us once more remind our readers that ' thie only issue which has really been thied at Chelsea for these many weary days is whether or no Lord Luc.ASY did all that a good officer could do for the preservation of the cavalry horses under his conmmand during the period which elapsed between two dates named. All matter beyond this is entirely irrelevant to the inquiry in the forn to which it has been confined. iNow, any one who takes up Lord LVOA?e'S speech of Mllonday would imagine from his assertions, which are throwvn in with such a broad .7-i P'rivs dash, that Colonel T-u_Locq hiadc really abandoned his points. Not a bit of it. Look only to our impression of Saturday, - and it w.ill there be seen that Colonel TurLoen still stoutly mnaintains that teinporary shelter might have been provided for the cavalry. This statement he supports by tbe evidence of M ajor THOxrpsoN, Colonels GuirriTH, DoHExry, Low, an:d Dou les, Messrs. RxwLrxSOx and. BnAeB2n1DGmu and, to a ee rtain extent, by thfe rehiotaet tes'imony of General Amnr. He tells *m; th:at, if what Lord LucAN s;ys be true, that half the horges were under shelter by the mitdLlle of February, it wa because thle shelter of half of them was-the grave. He shows that Lord LdcJ's assertion that no part of the Cavalry Brigade was in tha Crimea on -the 1st of October was entirely destitute of foundation. It will be seen that Lord ILu&CAw, with a bold, dang haud, blots out all fhis, and treats his own victory. as one wllich his opponent admits. The only victory, -we fear, to wvhich Lord Luc3-. can lay much claim is tiiat of having won the reply.- It was no bad calculati6n on his part that Colonel TuLLoca's statements of Friday might on Monday be forgotten, so that he might put into the mouth of his opponent whatever statements.might seeni to be most for his own interest. We cannot conclude 'without inviting most particular attention to theperoration of Lord LucA2es speech, in which he boldly and specifically accuses the mLsuTsm for WAR and the SECRzTARY to the TREAsurY, who had charge of the: Conomissariat Department, with killing the cavalry horses. He, too, can speak of "want of promptitude and ingenuity ;" he, too, can charge public officers and Ministers with having. starved the horses and the army too.- Lord Luc.- was the General of Cavalry on the spot. Clearly the MiImisTER of WA. is unfit for his position if Lord Lucxx can prove his words. Lord LucAS, on the.other hand, is unfit to retain the QuEExN's commission if his statements are slanderous and false.

Rose, Higgins, and Xose, malleableiron makers, causing the death of four persons. The works in qustion are situate on the bank of the Birmingham Canal, at Bilston, and comprise some 20 puddlng furnaces and two rolling-mills, which afforded employment for about 70 or 80 persons. To keep in motion one forde-hammer and one set of rollers there are two engines, one of 2O and the other of 35 horse power, fed by four egg-shaped boilers, three of which stood, up to yesterday, side by side, with one of their ends a few yards from the canal. Yesterday evening, at a quarter before 7, the centre one of the three last-named boilers exploded with a report that was heard for miles around. The boiler, which was oft. 6in. in diameter by 36ft. long, and n:ade of 7-16ths iron, while one end was blown into the canal, was propelled with terrific force into tho works, bringing down a chimney stalk 60ft. high, tearing a neighbouring boiler from its bel, and ripping up rolls and their bedding, which were so firmly secured that a force equal to hundreds of horse power must have been required to move them. At this obstacle the further progress of the boiler was stayed, and there it now lies torn into pieces. The roofing of the works and its surrounding bric work were c.ast to an almost incredible distance. Massive iron uprights were broken to pieces, and scattered, witht disjointed heavy roachinery, upon every hand. The canal was nearly dammed up with the ruins which fell into it, sinking beneath them a longhZoat that lay near the works, and endangering the lives of the boatmen. As soon as-possible after the explosion search was made for the misming men. Benjamin Plant, the engineer at the time, was found in the canal, uite dead, with a severe wound upon his head. Thomas ourt, a boilennaker, was found near to Plant, also dead, from an ijnry upon the head of a more severe character than th?t by which the engineer was killed. Joseph Hill, another' engineer, was found dead at a considerable distance from the immediate site of the -explosion.

A youth named Willialu Harris, an underhand puddler, was the fourth person killed. In addition to the abovenamed personis who are killed a few have been injured. The one most severely so was JoIn Johnson, who has sastained a compound fracture odthe arm. All these o;btained almobs iminiediate suricaL ai. The deceased Court was not employed by Mess.

PUBLICY 1'POCLAIMATION O.7 TBACE. The intelligence that peace was to- be 'foea1l proclaimed yesterday with al the usages deriyed. from ancient times took the metropolitan pubil abinewhatbysurprise. No official communication had been made on the subject, beyond the order-- posted in conspicuous places-to the effect that carriages were not to pass between St. James's Palace and Temple.bar after half-past 10 a.m. until the procession had performedthatpartof its journey. Whea the procession was to begin, and at what points the proclamation was to be nade, were questions left to be settled by such individuals as wrere blessed with facilities for obtaining private information, or cherished traditions of wlhat was done 40 years ago. Hov ever, a general notion that there was to be a "sighf' of some kind, and that at no late hour, was soon spread through the metropolitan population, aiid at about 10 o'clock the various streets that leadinto the greattrunk thoroughfares were.thronged by a more than ordinary number of passengers, who took the direction of Charing-cross and St. James's Palace. Shortly before 11 o'clock the foot pavement of Pall-mall was occupied by a line of spectators, who, although not packed close enough to prevent free passage, wvere safficient to indicate an universal feeling of curiosity. Moreover, the windows and balconies of the cluibs and private houses in Pallmall and the foot bf St. James's-street were thronged with spectators, -and it is said that two of the Royal-children 6ccupied seats at a; window of the old Palace. - However scauty official information may be, a- certain power of prognostication is always to be. found among the masses on the occasion of a general festivity. 'Whence the creed was derived we kmnoa not, but certainly everybody in the Pall-mall; line firmly believed that the procession would start from St. James's Palace at half-past 11, and was not far wrong in the supposition; for after they were tired of admiring the glittering cuirasses of the Life Giards who were stationled at the Palace-gate, and laughing at those conspicuous stragglers who always serve as targets for the public wit on festive occasions, matters really began to assumeabusiness-like aspect shortlybefore 12 o'clock, when the procession, which had assembled in the Stable-yard, St. James?s, emergea into the open space in front of the Palace. The ceremony opened with three blasts of the trumpets, and then Garter King of Arms read aloud Her Majestys proclamation of the restoration of peace, at the conclusion of which the crowd gave three cheers, and this was followed by another blast of trumpets. 'We cannot say that the anxiety to catch the words of this document was very intense. Very few heard them, but the reflection " We shall read it in the newspaper to-morrow" was a panacea for the slight disappointment. When the high personages who had remained stationary at the gate began to put themselves in motion, and the "procession' was duly exhibited in the eyes of the multitade, the spectacle was not of a kind to cause excitement or even astonishnient. Certainly, a herald clad in a tabard is a personage not to be seen every day, and therefore the heralds held the same distinetion in this national solemnity as the " men in armour" in a civic procession; but the other elements in the show were not remarkable (as far as the eye was concerned), unless, indeed, -we except the series of Westminster beadles, who provoked slight demonstrations of mirth. Those prosaic natures who, not content to regard the ceremony as a symbol deriving its lustre from the event it was intended to symbolize, had expected a grand coitp d'Xvil-something to dazzle the vision, without reference to any " association of ideas"-were not a little puzzled when the whole procession had in a very few seconds passed before them. " Is t7is the sight 2" was the question put by many a man to his neighbour; and those who had placed chairs and benches in convenient spots to increase their power of commanding the prospect moved them away with an expression of wonder that they had taken such pains for so short a satisfaction. Nevertheless, the list of the personages who figured on the occasion looks imposing enough, inasmuch as the procession comprised a troop of the 2d Life Guards, under the command of fieutenant-Colonel Ogilvy ; the Beadles of W7estminster, walking two and two, with staves; the High Constable, with his staff, on horseback; the lligh Bailiff and Deputy-Steward of Westminster; Knight MEarshal's men, two and two; drums, Drum-M1ajor, trumpets, and Sergeant-Trumpeter; Sir Charles Young, Garter King of Arms, on horseback; three Pursuivants, habited in their tabards-viz., 'ir. J. R. Planch6, Rouge Croix, riding alone, followed by MIr. R. M. Lane, Blue Mantle, and MIr. G. iW. Collen, Portcullis, riding abreast and flankled on each side by three Sergeants-at-Arms, three of whom carried each a gold mace; four Heralds, also habited in tabards, riding two and two abreast-. viz., Mr. W. Courthope, Somerset Herald, Mr. G. Harrison, Windsor Herald, Mr. T. W. Kiug, York Herald, and M1r. A. W. Woods, LaLcaster }ferald; M1r. E. Laurie, Norroy King of Arms; followed by another troop of Life Guards, brmging up the rear. When the party had reached Charing-cross, where the proclamation was read for the second time by Norroy King of Arns, " looking towards WVhitehall," in conformity with ancient precedent, the spectacle really became striking, on account not of the Personages who came to be seen and heard, but of the throngs who were there to witnessthem. The Trafalgarsquare district was occupied by one of those dense moving masses wihichl seem only possible on the sulpposition that an entire capital has turned, itself out of doors. A similar throng collected itself at the eastern end. of the Strand to witness the arrival of the procession at Temple-bar. The closing ofthe aucient city gates upon the western visitors gave a peculiar zest-to this part of the ceremony. One can't be on both.sides of the gate at once, but we believe that the interchange of civilities between the intruders from the west and the jealous guardians of the east is in this fashion :-Jumior Pursuivant, after three soundings of the trumpet, gives three knocks, upon which the City Marshal asks, " lVho comes there ?" The Pursuivant now explains that he and his companions are "oflicers of arms" come to publish Her Majesty's "' Proclamation of Peace." The cautious guardians of the gate then adiit the Pusuivant aflone, 'who presents the Queen7s w-arrant to the Lord MIayor. 'When this document has been read, and the Lord Mayor has authorized the opening of the gates, the Pursuivant is conducted back to the gates by the City Marslhal, -who courteously te'ls him that they are no longer closed. humediately after the passage of Temple-bar the proclamation was again read to sound of trumpet, and tlie procession again moved on, increased by the Lord MIayor's carriage, and followed by a crowd - which -went on increasing in density until, after a fourth reading at "Wood-street, where the Cross in Cheapside formerly stood, it reached its goal at the Poy3al axchange, the most important point iu the city for official publication. At that point an iumense crowd had assembled in front or the Mansion-house, on the esplanade before the Royal Exchange, and onm the flight of stepB leading into the interior ot the building. Te platioyts of the Bank of Eng,lalnd also muster-ed 1in great force upon tha roof, and o magnifieent banners floated fEcinm the portico of the Ma1sion-house, which like- wis contained lts comnplement of privileged spectators. The procamation was read for the last tiDe in froint, of the Echange, and there the cere3mony ended. Perhaps the most remarkable feature of yesterday's ceremony was its perfect spontaueity. lioae of Tffhoso preparations which are so oftcn made for a public solemnity had been made on this occasion. NSo platforms had been raised;- no windurs had been offered for hire ; and, let us add, there 'was nothing in the proession itself, considered as a mere "sighlt," calculatd to excite so muclh interest as is awakened by speotacles of far less moment. But the meagrm character uf the pageant was counterbalanced by the importa-nce of the event with wvhich. it was coanectad; and hence a national holyday was created with scarcely any nctico at all,
FOBEIGN INTELLLIGBCOE. . FRAME. (FROx OUR OWN COB SPO?tbmm) [A porton of the following apteared in our second edition of vdwEr-A. ..-1 PARIS, MoNDAY, APRIL 28, 6 P.M. The Minister of State attended in official costume at 2 o'clock this day at the Senate, and announced the exchange of the ratifications of peace. He afterwvard proeedede to the Legislative Corps, and made ths samne announcement. The papers were laid on the table of both Houses, hut no distribution of them was made to the Deputies or Senators. A well-k-nown news agent in Paris has been arrested by the police and lodged in prison, under a charge of participating in the abstraction of the State papers wvhich have recently appeared in the Brussels journal i Noi-d. A searchingf inquiry is going on, and proceedings are to be taken against theparties proved to have been concerned in the affair. The festival of Easter, according to the Greek computation, wYas celebratedyesterday at the Russian chapel in the Rue deBerri. Count Orloff and the principal Pcussian residents attended at 12 o'clock. The religious ceremony terminated, as usual, by the exchange of the fraternal embrace betwveen the persons present and the officiating archpriest, M. Vasailieff. M. Vassilieff afterwards entertained Count -Orloff and the otherRussian "notabilities" at dinner. It is stated as positive that Prince Dolgorouki, -principal Aide-de-Camp to the Emperor Alexander and Mlinister at War, will be the new Russian Ambassador to Paris. The Embassy will be placed on a footing of much splendour, and will probably surpass a ll tlhe others in the magnificence of its hospitality. W!e read in the Monmitezet de la Flotte:- "The camps preparing for the troops about to return from the Crimea are to be established in excellent and most healthy situations. At the distance of 35 kilometres from :Toulon, along th^s coast of the department of the Var, and at the entrance of the Gulf of Jonan, is a cluster of islands called Lerins, the largest of which bears the name of St. Marguerite. That island is 1j maile in length from east to wesf-, and half a mile in breadth from north to south. -Portions of it are very low, particularly at its eastern and western extremities, but the ground rises gently towards the north. On its highest point stands the citadel, in which, according to the tradition of the country, was imprisoned in 1686 the man with the iron mask, whose history is still an impenetrable mystery. This citadel is a regular pentagon. Two bastions, united by a curtain, form the north front. At the angle of the western bastion is a stone sentry-box, indicating the landing-place. At the foot of the citadel, to the N. and N.N.W. of thxe fort, and within a very short distance of the shore, is a good anchorage in four or five fathoms. To the W. of the citadel the coast is lined with shoals as far as a fortification called the Tower of Balagnier, bat to the east the coast is safe and easily accessible. There are also on the island a fortified tower, called the Tower of the TradeliUre, built on the point of the same name, and a small fort called Ragon. The island of St. Mfarguerite is well wooded, healthy, and of an agreeable aspect. The island of St. Honorat, the next in size, is situate at a distance of about M00 yards from St. M[arguerite. It derives its name from the celebrated convent founded by that Saint in 410, the ruins of which are still to be seen. St. Honorat is only three-quarters of a mile in length. The island of Porquemolles, situate within a short distance of Toulon, belongs to the group of the Hyires. It is inhabited, well cultivated, and its temperature mild and salatary. Porquerolles affords excellent shelter to the bay of Hyeres, and the numerous fortifications erected along its coast are, intended to protect the vessels which, in time of war, seek refuge in the bayA lighthouse, seen 20 miles at sea, stands at the southern point of the island, and is extremely useful to the navigation of that part of the Mediterranean. Cavallaire is on the continient, not far from St. Tropez. Its port is small, buit safe, being screened by the cape of the same name, and situate in an advantageous position. Near it is the battery of Cape Taillat, constructed on the rains of an old castle. It is impossible to find more eligible sites for the encampment of the troops than St. Marguerite, Porquerolles, and CavalIaire. These points are isolated and extremely healthy. The air is good, the temperature excellent, and sea breezes temper the heat of summer, which is never intolerable.' The sale of spring articles of dress and nouveautms was very active in Paris during the week. Many of the shopkeepers, who had laid in but a limited stock, have accordingly been obliged to apply to the wholesale houses and manufacturers, and their orders, it is hoped, will afford employment to the operatives of certain localities during the entire summer. Lyons f is unable to meet the demands on its nianufactures. At Mujhouse and Rouen the important transactions f -which took place in the beginning of April have 'been followed by a little calmness, but all I the stock is exhausted, and the price of goods ' constantly tends to increase. In the Paris corn- market the decline, which had made such rapid c progress last week, was suddenly checked on glonday, in consequence of the large purchases I simultaneously effected by English speculators at Has-re, BordeauLx, and MIarseilles. The reaction I was felt in the provincial markets, which became t firmer, and on Wedinesday the first quality of flour I advanced in Paris from 81f. and 82f. to 90f. and 91f. per sack of 157 kilogrammes. On Saturday prices maintained themselves, andc towards the close of business they even advanced to 92f. The accounts f-om the provincial markets all come with a 1 rise of 2f. and 3f. per hectolitre. This reaction helped to extricate from serious difficulties a number of firms which had on hand considerable quantSities of foreign flour, and were sadly compromised by the fall. 'Wheat also followved the upwvard movement, and advanced about 3f. per I hectolitre. All the advices from the departments state that cattle find everywhere a ready sale. The last market at Vernon was not abundantly supplied, I but the cattle were generallyof a superiordescription. Oxen sold atfrom If. 40c. to If. 60c. per kilog,ramme. Little or no business is doing in the wine market at Berey. Mlerchants, expecting a fall in prices, are waiting, and consumers demand a reduction in prices. Languedoc brandy sells with difficulty at 163f. per hectolitre, and spirits from beet only fetch 1({'f.l The Three per Cents. closed to-day at 73f. 65c. for the end of the month; the Four-and-a-Half per 'Cents. at 93f. 25c.; and the new Loan at 74f. 30c.; Orleans Railway Shares, 1,400f.; Great Northern, 1,0G5f.; Strasburg, 1,040f.; New Shares, 883f. 75c.; Paris and Lyons, 1,440f.; Lyons to the Mlediterranean, 1,6o2f. 50c.; Western of France, 910f.; Bordeaux and Cette, 787f.

The only very recent news that we have from Russia I have already forwarded to you. Prince Menschikoffhasbeen relieved of his post as GovernorGeneral of Cronstadt, and Prince Gortschakoff (from Vienna) has been definitively nominated Minister of Foreign Affairs: this latter, of course, involves the retirement of Count Nesselrode from the same post. Withrepard tothe first change, it mayberemembered that Prince Menschik-off has been incapacitated by ill health, or want of good will, from entering upon the duties of this arduous post, which was conferred on him in anticipation of an attack on Cronatadt and St. Petersburg; the nomination had speia4l reference to a state of war, and may therefore be superseded now as much on accoumt of the war having ended as of Prince Mlenschikoff's being unable dr umnilling to fulfil its duties. I mention these two 'aircumstances, because I find tlis clange frequently brought into connexion with the retirement of Count Nesselrode from the Mfinistry of Foreign Affairs, as a sort of poetical justice exercised upon the two chief promoters of the late war; for, strange to say, since the retirement of Count Nesselrode has been known certain correspondents from RuLssia have stigmatized him whom we are accustomed to look upon as the representative of a peace policy as " the man to whose faulty political combinationS the late war must be attributed." The only thing that I have at presentmet withtofavourthe corremtness of thislatter view is,that in the Ã¯Â¿Â½hoice of Count Nesselrode's successor Baron Meyendorff should have been passed over; this latter is undoubtedly the most able diplomatist in that most able service, the Russian, and far superior to Prince Gortschakoff in every way; and 1maron Meyendorff has hitherto been looked on as a stanch supporter of the Nesseirode views and policy. It may be, as I heard at the time of Prince Gortschakoff's assuming the office provisionally, that overtures were being mnade to Baron Meyendorff, which the state of his health, which has for many years been unsatisfactory, has compelled him to decline. Another change that has been notifed to you very recently is the nomination of Count Orloff to the Presidency of the Council of the Empire, in the place of Prince Tchernitscheff. The object of this change is to prepare for Prince Gortschakoff, who at present occupies only provisionally the post of Stadtholder of Poland, the post of Military Commander of the capital, or Imperial head-quarters,as it is called in military language. Prince Gortschakoff is understood to aspire to this post whenever he retires from Warsaw on the assumption of the. reins of government by the Grand Duke Nicholas, and by Count Orloff's acceptance of the post of President of the Council it becomes vacant. Prince Wittgenstein, who was the bearer of the treaty of peace to Pa-is after its ratification by the Emperor, passed through here (Berlin) on the 24th inst. The Enperor returned from Moscow at 2 o'clock on the 14th inst. I already, some days back, sent you an extract from the address delivered to him by the Metropolitan of Moscow. I have since then looked in vain in the Russian papers, or in lettersfrom Russia, for the text-of the speech the Emperor is represented by the Paris Coastitutionmel to have addressed to the nobility and commercial corporation of Moscow. (The Nord pronounces the speech as given in the Freiich paper to be a fiction.) The only notice I have met with is that the. abovementioned bodies presented the Emperor with an address of thanks for the peace, wlhich the Enmperor received very graciously. Ii the presence of General Tschewkine (the; new Minister of Publia WForks) the Emperor expressed the hope that- the indispensable means of furthering the internal developement of Russia-viz., the increase of the means of communication-wrould form the subject of the special care of the Imperial Government. The Minister of Finance, Von Borch, is empowered by the Emperor to treat with foreign capitalists for the purpose of furthering the construction of canals, railroads, high-roads, and steam navigation. :How universal the conviction of the necessity of these increased means of communication has become among the people, and what an ill-service Count Rleinmichel, the late Minister of Public Works, has done the country in opposing the introduction of railroads, is evident from the following :-W'hen it was notorious that the Austrian Cabinet had forwarded to St. Petersburg for acceptance the wellknown Four Points, together with a fith of unknown contents, the bitter joke passed from mouth to molith that the Western Powers stipulated for Count Kleinmichers restoration to office. Numbers of foreigners engaged in trade and commerce, and even workmen, have arrived at St. Petersburg since the conclusion of the peace. The Russian Embassies are very willing now to grant p.asports to any one connected with commercial enterprises, and ieven the subjects of the Powers so lately at war with Russia are readiiy provided with the necessary risa, after telegraphic inquiry in St. Petersburg. The High Admiral of the Fleet, considering that a supply of fuel is a vital question for the steam fleet, on which the fate of the Russian seam naval force entirely depends, and in the hope of withdrawing this question from the influence of external political events, has urgently appealed tothe hmperial mining establishments to devote their attention to the discovery of any,-even the sma;Bst, ;trata of coal, and has invited private persom to oin in the search. A committee has been appointsedi, vith the surgeon of the tt of the fleet for tschairman,forthepurposeof inquiring into the esults of the inspections made by Councillor teitern in the marine hospitals last year, amd roposing suitable plans of reform. The clothing f the seamen, which formerly came wvithin the wovince of the commander of the qziipage, is in uture to be intrusted to special cormmisaries. The ;tate bakeries, which have hitherto supplied the Leet with bread and biscuit, are to be let to' ,rivate persons, with whom the GoTernment will a future contract for the supply of those articles 'he contracts for corn are in future to be made. y the Commissariat direct with the producers, with'ut the further intervention of middlemen. These re some of the last reforms introduced into the adainistration of the fleet. With the return of the Emperor to St. Peters)urg renewed activity has been imparted, not only o the diplomatic and financial affairs, of which -we iave already had many intimations, but also to maters of internal reform. For instance, a provisional ommittee has been appointed in the Ministry of the nterior to examine into all accounts of the departnent ol the executive police from the year 1837 Lp to the present time which have not been ntroduced into the general statenment of acounts. It is evident that it is hereby intended to equire some knowledge of, and control over, the videly-extended powers of this branch of the serrice, which of late years has extended its agency )eyond all boumds of reason and law. A more peedy and indulgent management of the censorship n St. Petersburghas given rise to renewed expectaions of important reforms about to be introduced nto the management of the press; and perhaps iothing would surprise any onie returning to Russia lOW, after an absence of a few years, so much as ;he comparatiely free tone of conversation. The ?resent Emperor, who as long as his father was alive Nas looked on generally as feeble-minded and in,ompetent, and vastly inferior to his bolder brother Jonstantine, is now recognized by the people as possessing firmness, justice, discrimination, capacity for business, and untiring assiduity in its liseharge; and as little backward is the population, 't any rate in St. Petersburg and the Baltic provinces, in laying the losses and humiliatio#->of Russia at the door of the late Emperor, whose inordinate ambition led them into an ill-timed war. The Minister of Public Education in Russia has been nominated member of the Council for Military Education this is the first step towards inrtroducing an element not-exclusively military into the educational management of the army. Prince Peter of Oldenburg, the curator of the Alexander Lyceum and the Law School, had represented how difficult it was, especiaLy in war time, to procure military officers of rank to act as teachers of French, German, and English in these schools (as is required by a statute of 1849), and proposed that a portion of these functions should be intrusted to civilians. The Emperor testified his approval of the proposition by the words written on the margin:- " Agreed, and in future I do not wish that officers belonging to the army should be appointed to functious in civil institutions." The Emperor of Russia has addressed the following letter to Count Orloff, the first Plenipotentiary of Russia at the Paris Congress:- S Petersb.rg, April 17. "Count Ale.xis Fedorowitscb,-The exchange of the ratifications of the treaty which you signed on the 30th March has completed the work of pacification confided to your care Tnis peace my father, of imperishable memory, had sincerely desired. Animated by the same sentiments, I accepted the propositions as soon as it was found that the object which the Emperor Nicholas had pro posed to himself, of securing the welfare and the right3 of Christianity in the East, had been attained. Belying on your oft-tried devotedness to the Throne and the country, I appointed you my First Plenipotentiary for the conclusion of a peace the conditions of which should offer a solid fonudation for the repose of Europe. The attitude, full of good faith and straightforwardness, which you adopted from the commencement of the negotiation, soon opened a path to the solution of the difficulties which surrounded you, and to reconciliation with the Powers which were at war with us. lhe accomplishment of this great and laborious mission has fully satisfied rayexpectations,and the freshmeritswhich you have thereby acquired in my eyes give you a right to my cordial gratitude. Under the auspices of the peace, now re-established, my first care will be devoted to the development of the prosperity of the empire hich God has confided to my care. I am firmly convinced that I sball always find in you a zealous co-operator and an cnlightened councillor in the labours of government wllich await me in the pursuit of this sacred object. As a mark of the high confidence which I place in you, I have just raised you to the dignity of President of the Council of the Empire,as wellxas of the Committee of Ministers, and of those of the Caucasus and of Siberia. 1-repeat to you at the same tilne tho assurance of my unchangeable friendsAhip. "ALEXANDER."
MON'YMArAJT and I2rTYITBLUGxCB. Tuesday Evening. The quotation of gold St Paris is about 5 per mule premium ( r - to the last tariffl, which, at fthe Eiing3i h St pnoee of St. 175. I%cl: per oz. for standard gold, gives an exchange of 25.29i ; and, the exchange at Paris on London at short being 25.37i, it follows that gold is about 0,32 per cent. dearr in London than in Paris. By advici from Iamburg the price of gldais 4264 per mark, which, at the English Mint price of 31. 17a. 10d. per oz. for standard gold, gives an exchange of 13.5S ; and, the exchange at Hamburg on London at xhort being 13.7, it follows that gold is 0.64 per cent. dearer in London than in Hamburg. -The course of exchange at New York on London for bills at 60 days' sight is 1094 per cent., and, the par of exchange between England and America being 109 2340 per cent., it follows that the exchange is nominally 0.8 per cent. against Enllgland; but, after making allowance for charges of transport and difierence of interest, the present rate leaves no profit on the transmission of gold either way between the two cotuntries. The English funds were rather less weak this morning at the commencement of business, and, although they subsequently experienced a relapse, the market at the close manifested a tendency to firmness. Consols for money, which left off last evening at 911 to 92, opened at 92 to From this they soon eclined to 91, but this fall seemed to induce purchases on the part of the public, and the last transactions-were at 92k for money and 924 to i for the 8th of May. Bank Stock left off at 211 to 212j1; Redluced, 901to 9 ; New Three perCents., 9'S to 4. Annuities, 17 1-16; India Stock, 226 to 22Ã¯Â¿Â½.; India-bonds, 10s. to 5s. discount; and Exchequer-bonds, 98 to J. The quotation of Exchequerbills was nominally 6s. discount to par, but the sale of any large quantity wDuld be impracticable, except at a serious decline. The time will soon arrive for the renewal of the descriptions dated in June, and, unless some great change should meanwhile take place in the state of the market, an increase in the rate of interest or the funding of a considerable amount will be inavoidable. Money continues in demand in the Stock-Exchange at 6 per cent., and the inquiry out of doors and at the Bank of England is likewise active. Thursday next, the 1st of May, being the day for the half-yearly balance at the Bank of England, the transfer-books will be shut, and a holyday will most probably be kept at the Stock-Exchange. There was little activity in foreign securities, but prices were in some cases slightly firmer toward the later hours of business. In Turkish Six per Cents. the transactions took place at 95s for money | and 961 and 96 for the account. The Four per Cent. Guaranteed Stock was negotiated at 101qL. The other operatiorn comprised-Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents. at 63; Ecuador New Consolidated, 154; ! Mexican, for money, 21X ; for the account, 21[ and ;Russian Five per Cents., 104A and ; Spanish Three per Cents., 43.; the New IeLerred, 23i and i; Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 93. and 93" and Ecuador Peruvian, 584. iTn the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rat,; upon St. Petersburg was lower, while in the case of Vienna it was rather higher. With regard to other places there was no alteration of importance. The final prices of tae French Three per Cents. I on the Paris Bourse this evening were 73f. 70c. for money and 73f. 75c. forthe account, showing a recoverv of an eighth. About 170,0001. of Australian gold has be=n taken to-day tothe Bank-. Of the reent arrivals it is believed about half will be retainled here, and that the remainder will be sent to thD B3ank of Fraie, al- X though the rate of exchange is still at a print to cause gold coin to be remiMed from Pai4 to, London. The amount of gold brougibt by the Asia *ionr, New York to-day is 91,0001., bu it is undertoold! to have been ciefly consigned on French accomt.. The commercial intelliaence om this occasio* is, unimportant. The baMl-s contiumd to lose spcsie i rhile they were at the isamn time extendiig their discount. Fears of a sudden rsontraction were herefore still entertained. Thei7 course, howbver, was probably influenced by tlHrInowledgetlI.t an thel st of June the Government are to disburse' 1,400,0001. in gold from the Treas-w y vaults on aewont of the Texan debt, assumediby the Federmll G(oTerument at the time of the annasation of that State, the disputes in connexion wi(EF which havemnly jutt been settled. The stock-mamket was withbut animation, and most descriptioni, of securities- had been sold at a decline. Erie' Railway was! lusted 564; Panama, 105; Reading 91 [; and I Ualiois Central Bonds, 88. Nicaraguri was without ?eeovery, the price being 131. The acrounts from Panama of the railway traffic and the-health of thu Uisbtict were very favourable, and the' oompany hadl i ss-Aed a new tariff, with the view of en3ouraging the ransmission of freight, and especially the cargoes f whalers from the North Pacific. The wheat- narket at New York had experienced ;-till equal to- , t1. per quarter.

The bil regarding crossed checlis which ha3.; iassed the House of Commons hue jUst been printed, and proves, after all, to be ueauly worth,ess. The sole thing desired by the puilc was that he protection afforded by crossing a cieck to any ndividual banker should be legalizedL. When the ?resent.bill was first introduced by M: Pellatt tha, I was its principal object. The Goveimient altered. it soas to make it provide simply that a crossed i -heck should be paid through some Nvnker. Th1 was seen to be such idle leraislation-gmee the public I have always felt sufficiently secure on that point; -that the Government were ind&ced to pro. I pose new clauses granting all thn& was desired. These clauses met with technical sajections, ardi the final result is that they haus been abaltoned, and that the bill now stands in the form to. which it was first reduced. The castaffordsanother. illustration of the difficulty of olstaining any beRe- I fcial changes of a practical kindi -where oppositiin can be raised to them by a few ohAructive persens whomit maybe deemed advisabk to consult. The commercial community unanimously wished forthe measure in its full shape, and most of the bankers also recognized the good it would bring them by giving increased security to all banking trans3et;ons. A few establishments, however, wished to avoid the responsibility it would impose upon them of not paying checks at random, and the convenience of the public has in consequenee been sacrificed. The General Screw Steam Company have arranged for the payment of the 21. per share of returned capital to be made to the proprietors on the 7th of j May. The statement in the China advices yesterday, I that Mr. W.

Aspinall sailed to Hongkong, it is said, to con I sult Sir John Bowring as to the best means ol securing an impartial administration of the asses I of the firm, and, finding that a niail just arrivedi from England had brought out an act giving, supreme power to the Cjonsular Courts at the Chinese ports to adjudicate in all cases of insolvency, he at once returned to Shanghai. At the adjourned meeting of* the Royal Swedishi Railway, held this afternoon, the proposal forraising~ additional capitol, having been modified, was unanimously adopted. It was explained that the new directors who are about to assume office wish to be placed in a po3ition to show the Swedish Government that they areprepared to carry out the undertaking. At the same time it is necessary to posse funds. to reduce existing liabilities, a large~ amount being extinguishable on advantageousj terms. In about three months the portion of the line which has been already greatly advanced will be available for traffic, and the results will enable the shareholders to estimate the futureprospects of revenue. It is thought that the Swedish authorities 'will receive the representations of the shareholders in a favourable manner, and that they may probably be induced to extend the terms of the concession, particularly as the route followed forms an important link in the railway system of the country. The position of the holders of the obligations issued by the company was incidentally discussed, and, should any of the original shareholders refuse to take their proportion of preference stock, they are to be allowed the opportunity of participating in the subsequent 3ppropriation. It has been agreed that in future meetings shall be held every half-year. Annexed is the substance of the resolutions passed - "That the directors be authorized to create farther capital by an issue of shares not exceeding 83a334 of 4!. eatch to befirst offered to the present shareholders, share for share, to bear 7 per cent. preference dividend during the first five years, and 6 per cent. subsequently; a deposit of 1. per share to be-paid at the time of appropriation, and the firstca3lof U2. to be made at the end of four months, leaving the remaining 2!. per share to be called as the discretion of the directors may dictate, but not until after the next general meeting. "vThatno payment of interest on the exising shares be made tllfthe completion of the line, and that the first paymeent of interest on the obligations, including that then in arear. be pastpoed until the 27thof Apil, 1857. "' That the directors be requested to apply to-the Swedish Government for such modifications of the concession as may be deemed necessary." A meeting of Spanish certificate holders took place this afternoon, Sir J. Fitzgerald, M.P., presiding, when a series of resolutions were agreed to, organzing a new committee to prosecute their clabns 'both in Madrid and in this country. The several speakers adverted to the improved condition of the revenue of Spain and to the neglect which has been exhibited by successive Administrations in not providing for these securities. The departures froia the port of London for the Australian colonies during the past week have comprised eight vessels-three to Port Phillip, three to Sydney, and two to Adelaide-wit-h an aggregate capacity of 4,79G tons. The rates of freight exhibit rather more firmness.
RALWAY AND MINING SHARES. Tuesday Evening. The railway-marieot was steady with a moderate amount of business, but there was no general recovery from the late depression, The arrangement of the account interfered with the usual current of operations, and high terms of continuation were in all cases paid. For Indian, French, and Belgian shares the transactions were unimportant, but the latter towards the afternoon exhibited increased firnness. Mining descriptions suffered from sales, and prices declined. Australian land and bankdng shares presented little variation. Canada Land were negotiated atl42andleft off 140 to 145.

ZA r PO&T. I COURT OF OEANOXRY, INOX.S A. ? PA ATE CBABB. D.- Rr. VPA&T ^JCMe MC LORDS JusTIC3S of ArrPxA.) IN B13AsNI w,- TXhe argimients in this case, which was- part heard before the full Court on saturdacy, na reported inI7%, hmad of Monday, were resumed. t wlll be recollected that the ILord Chancellor intimated his opinion that, so far ashehadabeard the argument, the Court had jurisdiction to bear the caNe The case upon that point was concluded when the Court rose on Saturday, and the remaining points oE trading and act of bankruptcy were this morning dIscussed. lMr. DANIEL and Mr. ARCI=ALn Smrrms, in support of the petition, argued that Mr. Palmer, being a licen]tis ofthe Apothecaries' Company, and hating carried on the business of a general practitioner, as appeared from. the affidavit of Mr. Thirlby, who had purchased his busiess,. was a trader within the meaning of the Bankrupt Law Consolidation Acts the term "apothecary" apDearing amonz the trades or businesses enumerated in that statute. WitE regard to the lying in priwn, the words of the earlier part of the 69th section were clear and precise; and the learned counsel submitted that there could be no reasonable doubt but that the Commissioner ought to have decided that an act of bankruptcy had been committed. MIr. DE GEX, for the alleged baukrupt, said that, although he did not dispute the legal validity of the petitioning creditor's debt, yet he argued that there was an equitable objection to it, for that being a joint dobt, and the co-debtor having tendered the full amonnt, the netitioners were not entitled to proceed upon it to support7a banlruptcy; that vwith reg,ardto the lying in prison at was clear that the intention of the bankrupt law upon that subject was that so lying was a satisfactory indication of insolvency, and therefore the real test for the Court to be guided by was whetherthe lying in prison in this case was a proof of inability to pay the debt. The cases were " Rose v. Grigg," 1 Burrows' lReports; " Cope v. Simmons," 5 Barnewall and Alderson's Reports, 519; and " Exparte Bowes," 4 Vesey's Reports, 170. Unless the lying in prison wns shovwn to be by reason that the prisoner couldnot pay the debt, the test of insolvency failed. Here the custodv was upon a criminal offence, and did not and could not afford such test, because he could not go at large while the criminal charge was existing against him. Lord Justice K.NiGHT BPUCE.-The statute 11 and 12 of the Queen shows that a man may be adnmitted to hail, although in custody on a charge of felony. A Judge may, if he considers a case doubtful, admit to baiL Lord Justice TuR,axn.-Suppose a prisoner in custody upon a coroner's verdict, and the Court entirely dissatisfied with the finding, bailmnay be taken. Mr. DxNIEL.-A eoroner's jury in Ireland did find a verdict of wilful murder against Lord John RusseU during the time of the famine. - Mr. DE G(xX, in continuation, argued that even if that were so, and Mr. Palmer could legally be admitted to bail, still the gravity of the charge was such that it would be very unlikely any person would 'ne bail, and so the remaining in p ould still be' on a criminal charge, and not upon the c. san.; and, further, that as Mr. Palmer was placed in this unfortunate position he was not able to take the ordinary steps regarding his affairs to enable him to get rid of the imputation of lying in prison by reason of inabibility to pay his debts. The learned counsel called upon the Court, ;in a case so grave and doubtful, not to pronounce an opinion without first ascertaining that of a court of law. To return to the question of trading, there was the affidavit of M1r. Palmer, who distinctly swore that he never dispensed medicines unless of his own prescribing,and that he was a surgeon, and also that he had never in is life sold drugOts or other matters out ofhis shop unless he had prescribed the same, or in a wvay ancillary to his professional practice. MEr. DANIEL was heard in reply. Lord Justice 3KN7GHT BRUCE said that the first question seemed to the Lords Justices of some nicety and importance, and one which they had deemed it right to have tfie advantage of the Lord Chancellor's opinion-namely, whether the Court had jurisdiction to hear a matter as an appeal where a learned commissioner had declined to adjudicate. That int, therefore, had, with his Lordship's sanction, been Ceard before the full Court; but before the close of the argument the Lord Chancellor had been obliged to leave. Before, however, he retired he had intimated to the Lords Justices his impression that, sp posing the cavse to be as the appellants represented, thie CRourt had5jurisdiction, though further argLument muight remove that imupression. They (the Lords Justices) had heard the conclusion of the argument on that point on Saturday, and had both come to the conclusion that, accordin2g to the true exposition of the Bank;rupt Lawi Consolidation Act, and more particularly of the particular sections which had been cited iu alliuinent, the Court had the jurisdiction contended for; they w ere of opinion that the court of appeal had full1 jurisdiction to declare whether, in their opinmon upon the evidence, the commuissioner could have made an a judication, and to rem2it the matter to him with a decLartion, if they thought the evidence sufficient. As to the question of debt, there was no dispute before the commnissioner, nor waS there any before this Court, excepting aIS to a tender; the tender, howFever, was not mnade by the alleged bankrupt, nor was it mnade before the matter had been heard before the commiasnoner, nor before the petitioa had been brought before this Court, and, therefore-whatever use might he made of it in some other stage of the bankruptcy-it could not avail as a defence or ground of objection on the present occasion to stay the commaissioner in the exercise or his functions as to adjudication. As to the trading the commissioner did not seem to entertain any doubt, nor did the Lord Justices, for upon the evidence it was clear that the alleged bankirupt was an " apthecry within the meaning of the ter used in the Bankrupt Law Consolidation Act. Then, with regard to the prnncipal question,-nacnely, the nct of bankruptcy, here the alleged bankrupt was arrested, and, being ir a state of health not to permit of his removal to the county gaol, the sheriff's officer remained in the house, and while in this ca tody he was arrested on a charge of felony, and wvhen capable from the state of his health he wras transferred to the county gaol, both on the wvarrant en the copies and on the conmmitment for felony. lUpon bo'h he was removed into the gaol, and upon both he remained in custody for more than 21 days. His Lordship wvas oE opinion that the present case wYas one within the spirit and meaning, if not within the actual wvords-and he did not say the; were notwvithin the actual wvords-of the Bankr uptILar Con-. solidation A ct. The wrords of the 69th section had been much rcEferred to, but if this Court did not hold that the present case came within it, they should be construing the section against the plain intention and in a w ay which the letter did not require. His lordship was not surprised that the commissioner thought this a proper question to be considered by this Court. The declaration wvould be that upon the evidence the Court wvas of opinion that there wvas ground for an adjudication a]ainst 31r. Palmer, and with that declaration the matter wrould he remitted to the commissioner. Lord Justice TUR.NEse expressed his concurrence on Al these points, and entered into a full discussion oE the several clauses of the act. TL-ESD.AY, APRI 29. (Bqfore tfie LORDS JUSTICES of APPEAl..)

Camvpbell, of having his ease heard without the valtable aid of these learned gentlemen. Mr. DoNIEL then put in a fes of the dcouments, ane stated the various stages at whichthe cause had arrived in this court. he then shortly related the factis of the case, and among them the marriage betwieen Mr. Corley ana ars. Constantia Camphell, aged s2, and her death within sit months, and concluded by asking for a decree in the words of the prayer of the claim. CorSOUdTGATE, on the same side, hopedtthat when th questin of costs came to bc decded he should be permitteh to refer at some length to the emidence with whtich Mr. Campbell had so irregularly burdened the ease. tr. GhEENr E then proceeded for M u. Campbell, He said that the circumstances of and accompanying the marriage of this old lady of 82 and Mlr. Corley, then about 56 years old were of so suspicious a character thatb thou ththe facat wna not now disputed, it was the duty of for. Campbell' coD - sel to bring to the notice of the Court the terms upon which the mother and son lived, which would show that what was now suggested cas not only not hnlikely, hut extremely likely to be true. The suggeston and contenti on behalf of Mr. =ampbell was that there existed a secret trust for IUSbennt unertoo btwen r. orey and Mors.wCamp- his benefit, iinderstood between MvColy n hr Cn bell, and accepted by Mr. Corley, and this would be shows by the evidence of one Mr. Poulden, the landlord of the house in which Mrs. Campbell lived at the time of the marziage, founded on. twrodocuments, which he should read to the Court, which documents, he admitted, would not of themselves be sufficient to establish such a trust. That such a trust should be desired by Mrs. Campbell could be very readily presumed from the terms of affection and, as some of the witnesses Ideseribed, of doting in which this old lady lived with her son. When Captain Camp. bell went to Woolwich to study his mother went to reside near him. When she went out of town a roomn was always taken for her son, and called " Alexander's room." WVhen she went from London she regularly went upon a visit to him, and thus their intercourse was that of a fond mother and an affectionate son. It wn to be adm-itted that differences did sometimes arise betwege the mother and son, but they were founded wholly upoa misunderstanding. Captain Campbell, like otber gentlereaez of greater fortunie than his, indulged with some enthusjasm in speculations for the improvement of agricultural m4lements, and, his mother, being wholly ignorant c2 such matters, took offence at what she termed his waste od money and extravagant habits. The evidence of Mr. Poelden was shown in an affidavit, but the defendant Captair. Cainpbell had not been able to examine hin, by reason of the delaT and confusion of the proceedings in the examiner's offici Ioces9ioned, possibly, by the irregular course pursued in. kba exanunation of the witnesses by a party to the ca&ue, and. not by counsel.

ROLLS' COURT. Cir.cE2R-Y-T.Ah APRTT. 9?( SC -OTT V- RTI7VPTC (BefoRe ftlre. tAP TR nf MARA l .Tr ' This was a foreclosure suit, and now came on for further consideration. The only peculiarity was how to deal vith the interests of encumbrancers who were subsequent to the plaintiff, but who were prior to the Crown. It appeared that the plaintiffs were first mortgagees of an eqaitable interest of a person named Hunter in the flloowing property-namely, certainly leasehold houses in Gilbertstreet, Oxford-street, the interest of some money in the funds, and a polic- of insurance. At the hearing it had been referred to tne Chief Clerk to ascertain what other incumnrances there were on the property, and to state their priorities. By his certificate he found that the plaintiffs were the first encumbrancers, that the defendant Roberts was second. and the defendant Chaffers third enumnbrancer. He also found tbat Hunter had been duly declared an outlaw, and that the Crown was entitled to all Hunter's interest in the mortgaged pronerty at the date of such outlawry. He further found that there was a subsequent encumbrancer to the Crown. Mr. ROLtNDELL PAL3SEP. andMr. BPISTOwVE, for the plaintiffs, proposed to take a decree giving successive rights of redemption to the defendants Robarts and Chaffers, and, in default of their redeeming them, to sell the property, inasmuch as they cotuld not foreclose the Crown. Mr. WICKENS, for the Crown, did not object to a sale. Mr. Bromehead appeared for the defendant Robarts. The .LmsTEP of the Roars suggested that a decree for uimmediate sale would be the better course; but, having been informed that tn-o unsuccessful attempts at a sale had already been made, he directed a decree in the forn proposed by the plaintiffs' counsel, reserving liberty to all parties to apply for a sale at any time, as they might be advised.

F. Riddell, Mr. H. 3I. RiddeUl, and Mr. Turner appeared for the several parties. The VscE-CILUNCELOPs said that it appeared to him,[there being an absolute vested interest in a gross sum of money that would have to be paid to the legatee, he could not see how that could be kept back from her because she was going to become a nun. Put the case of a male entering holy orders at any time hereafter, could he be thereby barred of his right ? 'The 'young lady having attained 21, and therefore a vested interest under the exsecution of the pow er, she had anrght to receive her share, and the condition was therefore inoperative as to her.

XCELLOR gave judgment in this cause and petition, which were reported, as to the facts and aruaments, in 27e zTiies Last week. His Honoar, after observsng that the case was plain and clear, and presented no difficulties as to the relief to which the plaintiff was entitled, said that it would be necessary to look at the conduct of the several parties, both previously and subsequently to the formation of the company in whichthe plaintiff was a shareholder. He should endeavour to state in chronological order the appearance upon the scene of the different actors in this drama; and, first, as to Knell, whose case would occupy but little time-for the only charge against him was to be found in the first paragraph of the bill, as to his (with Matthews) oining with the defendants Harvey, Iron, Bel, and Belcher, "in the concoction of a scheme for maldng A large profit to themselves, by getting up a jointstock conpany, to search and work for gold in the said .5 acres of l.and" to which Matthews and KneU claimed to be entitled, " for which purpose it was arranged among them that the defendants Harvey, Bell, Iron, and Belcher should first appear as purchasers of the land from 3atthews and Knell, &c., the real intention of all parties beng that the said land should in both instances be ultimately paid for in shares of such company when formed, to be allotted for that purposc, and then disposed of in the market at as high a premium as could be obtained for the same.' With respect to Matthews it would not be necessary to make any observations, as he was not within the jurisdiction, but as to Knell, no part of this chargehadbeen proved, though there had been attempts in the evidence to show some fraud as to obtaining the purchase, which was not warranted by any charge in the bill. It was sufficient to say that he expressed no opinion as to the conduct ascribed to Knell in the evidence, and he had not called upon his counsel in any way to answer these charges. The intention appeared to be exactly that which appeared upon the agreement, and it was far too much by any stretch to fasten upon Knell any of the subsequent transactions. There was no inference of any conneXion with the company afterwards formed, and the bill would be dismissed as against himn with costs. As to the charges against the other pates, it was difficult to conceive anything morme painful PiAonour then read the paragraphs of the bill as to the p'urchase of t'he 500 acres for 17,4XJ'J, for which the defendants- Harvey, Iron, Bell, and Beleer avethei urmisory ote fo 3,00g. ; the mea- sure taen ogetu~te cmpanandthealleged in he ift pragaphtht Blchr ad eWSOi~'~be put f~J stwof ilediretoia ;a~4iiiorder to avoi~[ appear. lag in 'o.e double capaeitY dc directors of the company and ven':ors of land to the company, that they should ostensibly r-elinquish and make over their interest in the 500 acres to Harvey and Iron, but, nevertheless, with a reservation to themselves of a right to a proportion of the profits made by the resale to the company at an advanced price. He considered that this charge was fully proved against these four defendants Harvey, Iron, Bell, an Belcher. The bill went on to state the agreement of the 26thof January, 1852, fora sale to Richards andSwan, onbehalf of the company, for 40,0001. of what they had purchased from MIatthews and Knell for 17,000. Two points, therefore, were raised :-- That the company was tormed mainly with a view of reselling this land; and, 2 that of these four persons who had purchased the land, and were intere8ted in the profits, two were withdrawn as vendors, and named as directors upon this resale to the proposed company at the advance of 23,0001., they themselves having an interest in the profits to arise from the transaction. These charges, thus distinctly raised, required some answer, which had not been afforded. With regard to the prospectus, Matthews received a gossiping letter, to all apPe nce, both externally and internally, authentic. fHis Honour referred to the letter signed " Charles Lang ley,' nmentioned in our statement of the case.) Whatever mighit have been the opinio of MÃ¯Â¿Â½atthews, there was not the least doubt that Knell and the other parties to vwhom it was shown believed it to be genuine, and that an extraordinary gold pXoduct was to be found. His Honour, after stating the meetings and the course of negotiation leading to the purchase from Matthews and Enell, in which Harvey had taken an active part, said that he considered there was amply sufficient evidence that Harvey, Iron, Bell, and Belcher put faith inthe letter as genuine. They -would not have given 17,0001. upon the mere speculation of a fraud and of successfully getting up a bubble company. Harvey had also been told that Langley (the Government surveyor) might be relied upon for matters of fact, but not as to exercise of judgment. The land was then offered for 40,0001., but no one could be found to give that sum. The idea occurred to them of forming a company, and communications took place with Richards, who appeared to have acted not only as a metalbroker, but as a purveyor of directors for companies. It was adantted byy Harvey that it was necessary to put Belcher and Bell upon the direction, as no one else could be found. Whatever the cause, the result was that Bell and Belcher 'were put on the direction, and disappeared from the stage as vendors, without any satisfactory reason having been g*en. It was clear that this course had been taken from design, and Hrvey, as a solcitor, must have been well aware of the consequences of trustees putting 23,0001. of trust money into their own pockets. The contract for the resale was on the 26th of January, 1852, and Bell and Belcher appeared to have accepted the office of directors on the 28th. It had been stated somewhat faintly that they had relinquished their rights to Harvey and Iron, but there was no proof of this, while, on the contrary, they were found joining in the subsequent arrangements as to payment in shares. It was clear, therefore, that they had had from first to last an interest in the property; that they had allowed themselves to be put forward as those who were watching over the interests of the public, but had at once had one-quarter of the capital paid over to them, by which these two directors pocketed between them 11,0O0 shares. True it was that the prospectus mentioned that the contracts were to be seen at the office, but this was not suffident notioe to the public that the trustees were thus appro- riating the money of their cestuis quc trusts. He could ave no doubt as to the fact of Sir Edward Belcher having accepted this trust, for when he left upon his Arctic expedition, for which he had incurred a debt of gratitude from all England, he not only left a power of attorney, but in his letter of redinquishment asked that Boyle might act for him. Harvey was the person who prepared the prospects, nor could he be aoquitted from bengapaty to all theee transactions. iHe must confess that, ma;ing everyallowvance for the gold fever at the time, and a>bsolving Harvey from all knowledge that it was a mere fraud, the document was, to say the least, most incautious, and one that it was not creditable for any professionalman to have issued. The transaction, therefore (as to the resale for 40,00W1.), must be wholly set aside with costs, and the ownera must be left to make what they could with their 500 acres. He then came to Bagshaw, Bevan, and Denny, and there was some contest as to when they first became interestecd as directors, but Bagshaw's signature was appended to the minute of the 28th of January, 1852, mor could he be alloved to escape and say that he was not thon a director. Jfffi e was no such evidenoe as to Denny. -At the same time, ha did not find any evidence bringing h:ome to their knowloege that the purenase had been made for 17,000l. and not 40,00l., and he couldjnot therefore deml with them as trustees with knowledge. At this meeting of the 28th of Jamnay, 1852, it was agreed that the prospectus should ile issued, and although Mfr. BagshaV's name did not appear upon the prospectus, he did not intewpose to stay its issue. He thought it was not unnatnsal that these gentlemen, with respect to the statements in the prospectus, should have been infuenced by that hasmaning of men to be richs vhich had always proved a snare. T}ndes these circumstances, he could well believe that tbey would not be very critical. They had before them a document which they beheved to be genuine, containing thi 'wonderful account. As to the prospectus, therefore, their part was not very material, except as sho'winsg great want o-f caution; nor did their concurrence show any deliberate irtention of defrauding vhe public, as chaiad in the bill. Shares were applied for, and they certainly were not issued at random, for inquiries were made as to the solvency and resnectability of the applicants, though this snight be aLso a proof of the caution of the directors for their own security. About 7, COOt. was paid in in April, azd it was plain that, however golden the prospects were, the directorshad not found that any more than 7,0001. had been induced to be giJn by the public. A little respite was given as to the -womissory notes fromu the delay in obtaining the statutozy declaration fron "old Dariel Cooper" as to the grant of the land. TChen followed a mos0t irreguflar transaction as to -which Sir Edward Belcher was entirely free. Uere the serious charge began. Somnetbing must be do- Tto get money, only 7,0001. having been as yet obtained. Their plain duty was to have made honest representatos and tried to raise nioney by honest means. They ought 'to,have said that the company had prved abortive, or ito have taken steps to obtain irom abroad further informztion to satisfy the public if theystillthemselvesbelievedinfhetruth of their prospectus. They thought it was necessary to get the name of the company upon the list of the Stock-Euwhange, which happily had certain definite rules for the assistaunce of the public. On the 10th of April Bagshaw, who was very active in this matter, with the concurrence of theother then directors, except, perhaps, Denny, made a deliberate representation to the Committee of the Stock-Exchange, which he knew to be untrue, as to allotment of the sares. It had been said that the plaintiff was not injured by this transaction, as he had already had his shares allotted to him; but the Court could only regard it as a gross fraud on the plaintiff and the other shareholders, and a direct and wilful misrepresentation. it was impossible to imagine how a gentleman with a character to sustain could have been guilty of such a transaction. Nor was the matter in any way bettered by the representation that Bagshaw had never held shares, and that he had done this from mere good-nature. If ho did not take shares be ought to have withdrawn from the direction and wiithheld the sanction of his name. With respect to Denny, his statement was borne out by the facts, and although he did not discharge his duty thoroughly, yet he took 4,000 shares, and seemed to have thought that the purport of the transaction was that the directors were to take up the shares and risk th"ir money. He had sold 1,150 of these shares at a premium, and had shown bonafjdeg in returning the money made by him as profit upon these shares; but unfortunately he did not at once denounce the scheme to the Stock ExTchange and the public. As to this transaction Belcher and Boyle were in no way implicated. The sale all this time remained incomplete, and it was difficult to pro. vide for the purchase money from want of cash. An arbitration was entered into, upon which it was awarded that the purchase monoy should be reduced, and that Knell should take shares instead. It did not appear that Knell was aware of the irregularities which had been committed, and that the directors had no right to dispose of the shares. Bagshawv, Denny, Bevan, Iand Boyle were parties to the transaction by which Harvey and Iron agreed to acecpt4W,000 shares in lien of the 40,0001 purchase money, and the conveyance, dated the 25th of A,ugust, 1S52, w as, in pursuance of that agreement, executed by them. Boyle had all this time placed himself in a false position, from theagreement made with him that he should be p aid in shares for his services. The agreement of the 2.5t of August, as to commuting the 40,0001. purchase money into 40,000 shares, was a breach of trust on the part of the directors, who were bound to pay 20,000. in cash, and 20,001. in shares. Denny, it is true, opposed the transaction, but there was no minute in the books of any protest made by him or division. The position of Boyle was peculiar. he would at once discard all the evidence against him upon the winding-up petition, for he had had no opportunity of answering it. The only evidence against him in the cause was that he had been an active party from the first, and that the deed poll, by which 1,00W. in shares was secured to him for his services bore date the 7th of February, 1852, immediately before the issue of the prospectus. He had threatened the parties with actions, and had succeeded in obtaining 1,750 shares for his 1,00O. ; the shares being then at a discount. His Honour, after referring to the letters written by Boyle in February, 1853 (set out in the bill), said, that anything more discreditable than his conduct could hardly be conceived. If it had been proved that he hbd tampered with the bcooks -andu there eouldlbe no question that this had been deliberately effected by some one who had cut out the original entries and caused fresh and falsified entries to be bound up in the volume-it would have been his duty to have noticed his conduct in a different manner. There was no evidence, however, against Boyle as to this, and all that could be imputed to him vas his dealing with the 1,750 shares, as to which he hould make him primarilyliable. The objections which had been raised as to form were not material, aid, although the argunent of M r. Cairns was unanswerable as to the alternative relief (which had been asked on the opening of the case), the real aim of the bill was to have the transactions declared void, and the assets all brought into be realized and distributed, and there was no difraculty in dealming ith the matter, as the Court was enabled to make an order under the Winding-Up Act in the suit. The position of Shaw, the petitioner, was not altogether very favourable, but he did not intend to dismiss the petition, as certain evidence was therein adduced. He t erefore proposed to mnake one order upon the petition and cause. Then, as to Boyle, Rigbye, and Barlow, after the whole delusion had been exposed, these gentlemen had thought proper to go on acting as directors. Mr. Denny had here acted very properly; he saw that the -whole thing was a mere delusioin and that the moneys were not safe, and made a plain statement wlich opened the eyes of the world. Rigbye and Barlow were distinctly charged with lilowledge I anu with having drawn out the moneys and having applied them to their own use, without having vouchsafed any answer to the accusation, and he had had some doubt as to whether he ought not to order them to bring the money into court. These gentlemen hadbeen quitecontent to restunder the imputation made against them upon oath, that they had drawn out and apphed to their own use moneys of which they were trustees without condescending to give the slightest explanation. The result of the case would be that the bill should be dismissed as agtinst Knell on the grounds above stated; that the contract of the 20th of January, 1852, should te declared not binding as against the company, and the sale thereby made be set aide; the deed of conveyance of August, 1852, decared fraudulent and void-as against the company, and that deed andthe contract orderedto be ven up to be cancclled; that as to the 40,000 shares paid fortnhe alleged curchase of the land, the defendants Bell, Iron, and Belcher, and the estate of Harvey in the hands of his assignees, and also as to 1,750 of such shares the defendant Boyle must be held primarily liable; and as to the whole of such 40,000 shares the defendants Bagshaw, Denny, Bevan,and Boyle secondarilyliable. Inquiries must be directed as to how the 40,000 shares had been disposed of; an account taken of all moneye now in the hands of the directors or committee of management, or any of them, making all just allowmances; the business of the company to be wound up, subject to the dedaration already made; the costs of the suit as to setting aside the agreement and conveyance and the delivery to be paid by the defendants Bell, Belcher, andIron, reserving the remaining costs.

F. Riddell, Mr. H. 3I. RiddeUl, and Mr. Turner appeared for the several parties. The VscE-CILUNCELOPs said that it appeared to him,[there being an absolute vested interest in a gross sum of money that would have to be paid to the legatee, he could not see how that could be kept back from her because she was going to become a nun. Put the case of a male entering holy orders at any time hereafter, could he be thereby barred of his right ?

XCELLOR gave judgment in this cause and petition, which were reported, as to the facts and aruaments, in 27e zTiies Last week. His Honoar, after observsng that the case was plain and clear, and presented no difficulties as to the relief to which the plaintiff was entitled, said that it would be necessary to look at the conduct of the several parties, both previously and subsequently to the formation of the company in whichthe plaintiff was a shareholder. He should endeavour to state in chronological order the appearance upon the scene of the different actors in this drama; and, first, as to Knell, whose case would occupy but little time-for the only charge against him was to be found in the first paragraph of the bill, as to his (with Matthews) oining with the defendants Harvey, Iron, Bel, and Belcher, "in the concoction of a scheme for maldng A large profit to themselves, by getting up a jointstock conpany, to search and work for gold in the said .5 acres of l.and" to which Matthews and KneU claimed to be entitled, " for which purpose it was arranged among them that the defendants Harvey, Bell, Iron, and Belcher should first appear as purchasers of the land from 3atthews and Knell, &c., the real intention of all parties beng that the said land should in both instances be ultimately paid for in shares of such company when formed, to be allotted for that purposc, and then disposed of in the market at as high a premium as could be obtained for the same.' With respect to Matthews it would not be necessary to make any observations, as he was not within the jurisdiction, but as to Knell, no part of this chargehadbeen proved, though there had been attempts in the evidence to show some fraud as to obtaining the purchase, which was not warranted by any charge in the bill. It was sufficient to say that he expressed no opinion as to the conduct ascribed to Knell in the evidence, and he had not called upon his counsel in any way to answer these charges. The intention appeared to be exactly that which appeared upon the agreement, and it was far too much by any stretch to fasten upon Knell any of the subsequent transactions. There was no inference of any conneXion with the company afterwards formed, and the bill would be dismissed as against himn with costs. As to the charges against the other pates, it was difficult to conceive anything morme painful PiAonour then read the paragraphs of the bill as to the p'urchase of t'he 500 acres for 17,4XJ'J, for which the defendants- Harvey, Iron, Bell, and Beleer avethei urmisory ote fo 3,00g. ; the mea- sure taen ogetu~te cmpanandthealleged in he ift pragaphtht Blchr ad eWSOi~'~be put f~J stwof ilediretoia ;a~4iiiorder to avoi~[ appear. lag in 'o.e double capaeitY dc directors of the company and ven':ors of land to the company, that they should ostensibly r-elinquish and make over their interest in the 500 acres to Harvey and Iron, but, nevertheless, with a reservation to themselves of a right to a proportion of the profits made by the resale to the company at an advanced price. He considered that this charge was fully proved against these four defendants Harvey, Iron, Bell, an Belcher. The bill went on to state the agreement of the 26thof January, 1852, fora sale to Richards andSwan, onbehalf of the company, for 40,0001. of what they had purchased from MIatthews and Knell for 17,000. Two points, therefore, were raised :-- That the company was tormed mainly with a view of reselling this land; and, 2 that of these four persons who had purchased the land, and were intere8ted in the profits, two were withdrawn as vendors, and named as directors upon this resale to the proposed company at the advance of 23,0001., they themselves having an interest in the profits to arise from the transaction. These charges, thus distinctly raised, required some answer, which had not been afforded. With regard to the prospectus, Matthews received a gossiping letter, to all apPe nce, both externally and internally, authentic. fHis Honour referred to the letter signed " Charles Lang ley,' nmentioned in our statement of the case.) Whatever mighit have been the opinio of MÃ¯Â¿Â½atthews, there was not the least doubt that Knell and the other parties to vwhom it was shown believed it to be genuine, and that an extraordinary gold pXoduct was to be found. His Honour, after stating the meetings and the course of negotiation leading to the purchase from Matthews and Enell, in which Harvey had taken an active part, said that he considered there was amply sufficient evidence that Harvey, Iron, Bell, and Belcher put faith inthe letter as genuine. They -would not have given 17,0001. upon the mere speculation of a fraud and of successfully getting up a bubble company. Harvey had also been told that Langley (the Government surveyor) might be relied upon for matters of fact, but not as to exercise of judgment. The land was then offered for 40,0001., but no one could be found to give that sum. The idea occurred to them of forming a company, and communications took place with Richards, who appeared to have acted not only as a metalbroker, but as a purveyor of directors for companies. It was adantted byy Harvey that it was necessary to put Belcher and Bell upon the direction, as no one else could be found. Whatever the cause, the result was that Bell and Belcher 'were put on the direction, and disappeared from the stage as vendors, without any satisfactory reason having been g*en. It was clear that this course had been taken from design, and Hrvey, as a solcitor, must have been well aware of the consequences of trustees putting 23,0001. of trust money into their own pockets. The contract for the resale was on the 26th of January, 1852, and Bell and Belcher appeared to have accepted the office of directors on the 28th. It had been stated somewhat faintly that they had relinquished their rights to Harvey and Iron, but there was no proof of this, while, on the contrary, they were found joining in the subsequent arrangements as to payment in shares. It was clear, therefore, that they had had from first to last an interest in the property; that they had allowed themselves to be put forward as those who were watching over the interests of the public, but had at once had one-quarter of the capital paid over to them, by which these two directors pocketed between them 11,0O0 shares. True it was that the prospectus mentioned that the contracts were to be seen at the office, but this was not suffident notioe to the public that the trustees were thus appro- riating the money of their cestuis quc trusts. He could ave no doubt as to the fact of Sir Edward Belcher having accepted this trust, for when he left upon his Arctic expedition, for which he had incurred a debt of gratitude from all England, he not only left a power of attorney, but in his letter of redinquishment asked that Boyle might act for him. Harvey was the person who prepared the prospects, nor could he be aoquitted from bengapaty to all theee transactions. iHe must confess that, ma;ing everyallowvance for the gold fever at the time, and a>bsolving Harvey from all knowledge that it was a mere fraud, the document was, to say the least, most incautious, and one that it was not creditable for any professionalman to have issued. The transaction, therefore (as to the resale for 40,00W1.), must be wholly set aside with costs, and the ownera must be left to make what they could with their 500 acres. He then came to Bagshaw, Bevan, and Denny, and there was some contest as to when they first became interestecd as directors, but Bagshaw's signature was appended to the minute of the 28th of January, 1852, mor could he be alloved to escape and say that he was not thon a director. Jfffi e was no such evidenoe as to Denny. -At the same time, ha did not find any evidence bringing h:ome to their knowloege that the purenase had been made for 17,000l. and not 40,00l., and he couldjnot therefore deml with them as trustees with knowledge. At this meeting of the 28th of Jamnay, 1852, it was agreed that the prospectus should ile issued, and although Mfr. BagshaV's name did not appear upon the prospectus, he did not intewpose to stay its issue. He thought it was not unnatnsal that these gentlemen, with respect to the statements in the prospectus, should have been infuenced by that hasmaning of men to be richs vhich had always proved a snare. T}ndes these circumstances, he could well believe that tbey would not be very critical. They had before them a document which they beheved to be genuine, containing thi 'wonderful account. As to the prospectus, therefore, their part was not very material, except as sho'winsg great want o-f caution; nor did their concurrence show any deliberate irtention of defrauding vhe public, as chaiad in the bill. Shares were applied for, and they certainly were not issued at random, for inquiries were made as to the solvency and resnectability of the applicants, though this snight be aLso a proof of the caution of the directors for their own security. About 7, COOt. was paid in in April, azd it was plain that, however golden the prospects were, the directorshad not found that any more than 7,0001. had been induced to be giJn by the public. A little respite was given as to the -womissory notes fromu the delay in obtaining the statutozy declaration fron "old Dariel Cooper" as to the grant of the land. TChen followed a mos0t irreguflar transaction as to -which Sir Edward Belcher was entirely free. Uere the serious charge began. Somnetbing must be do- Tto get money, only 7,0001. having been as yet obtained. Their plain duty was to have made honest representatos and tried to raise nioney by honest means. They ought 'to,have said that the company had prved abortive, or ito have taken steps to obtain irom abroad further informztion to satisfy the public if theystillthemselvesbelievedinfhetruth of their prospectus. They thought it was necessary to get the name of the company upon the list of the Stock-Euwhange, which happily had certain definite rules for the assistaunce of the public. On the 10th of April Bagshaw, who was very active in this matter, with the concurrence of theother then directors, except, perhaps, Denny, made a deliberate representation to the Committee of the Stock-Exchange, which he knew to be untrue, as to allotment of the sares. It had been said that the plaintiff was not injured by this transaction, as he had already had his shares allotted to him; but the Court could only regard it as a gross fraud on the plaintiff and the other shareholders, and a direct and wilful misrepresentation. it was impossible to imagine how a gentleman with a character to sustain could have been guilty of such a transaction. Nor was the matter in any way bettered by the representation that Bagshaw had never held shares, and that he had done this from mere good-nature. If ho did not take shares be ought to have withdrawn from the direction and wiithheld the sanction of his name. With respect to Denny, his statement was borne out by the facts, and although he did not discharge his duty thoroughly, yet he took 4,000 shares, and seemed to have thought that the purport of the transaction was that the directors were to take up the shares and risk th"ir money. He had sold 1,150 of these shares at a premium, and had shown bonafjdeg in returning the money made by him as profit upon these shares; but unfortunately he did not at once denounce the scheme to the Stock ExTchange and the public. As to this transaction Belcher and Boyle were in no way implicated. The sale all this time remained incomplete, and it was difficult to pro. vide for the purchase money from want of cash. An arbitration was entered into, upon which it was awarded that the purchase monoy should be reduced, and that Knell should take shares instead. It did not appear that Knell was aware of the irregularities which had been committed, and that the directors had no right to dispose of the shares. Bagshawv, Denny, Bevan, Iand Boyle were parties to the transaction by which Harvey and Iron agreed to acecpt4W,000 shares in lien of the 40,0001 purchase money, and the conveyance, dated the 25th of A,ugust, 1S52, w as, in pursuance of that agreement, executed by them. Boyle had all this time placed himself in a false position, from theagreement made with him that he should be p aid in shares for his services.

Banco, Easter Termlt, oefore Lord Chief .Tutwe JERVIS and Justwets CRESSWE;L, CROWJ)ER, and WIL1,S. umhs was an action tried before Mr. Justice Williams at ihe last sittings in London. Mr. K NOWLsES, QC., now moved to enter a nonsuit, or to reduce the damages. The action was brought to recover the price of certain fLxtures, chattels, and effects sold to the defendant, to which he pleaded never indebted and pay. ment. The plaintiff's father had, it appeared, been in pos,ession of a farm under a lease, and upon his death the plaintiff came into possession without any assignment of the lease having been made to him. Subsequently the defend:alt entered under a new lease from Lord Hardwicke, and the question in the action was for what things and at what iate the incoming tenant was to pay. The plaintiff claimed he consumnig price of the straw left on the farm, which, according to the custom, was saidI to be two-thirds of the market price. The defendant contended it was to be valued by the acre, on a different principle, which re*ulted in a less sum being due for it. To estimate the price an agreement had been entered into to submit the value to arbitration; and at the trial it was contended by the learned counsel for the defendant that there must be a nonÃ¯Â¿Â½tUt on this ground, as the action could not be maintained so long as that ag,reement was subsisting; and on this ground the learned counsel now moved for a role for a nonsuit, or to reduce the damages given. Rule nisi granted. BRA,DFORD V. BALLARID. In this case, which was an action tried before Mr. Justice Williams, Mr. MA CnLNinBER, Q.C., moved to set aside the verdictasagainstevidence. The action was introverforgoods which the defendant was alleged to have converted. The defendant pleaded "Not guilty," that the goods were not the plaintiff's, and the plaintiff's leave and license to convert them. It appeared that in 1848 the plaintiff was engaged in some building speculations at Sandy.andthathe was anxious to raise 30. on some furniture in several houses belongingto hini. The defendantagreedtolendhiumthemoney on this security, and a deedwas drawvn up and executed, which mortgaged the furniture and plate of the plaimtiff in five houses atRadnor Cliff, in Sandy, "or elsewhere." At that time the plaintiff had a chest of plate deposited at the house of the defendant, and a 31r. Benzie, who made the inventory of the furiture, &c., in the five houses, also inchided the chest of plate at the defendant's in the inventory. The plaiitiffwas afterwards sold up, and now brought his action to recover the chest of plate, as not included in the security vhich he had given. The COURT saia they would speak to Mr. Justice WilI:ams about the case. rMIENELL V. DAWSON. In this case Mr. BOYTIL, QC., appeared in support of a rule obtained by 1dm, Mr. Rodgson having shown cause. The action was tried at the Guildhall before Lord Chief Justice Jervis, and involved some proceedings inu bankruntcy against a newsagent in Brighton, under vwhich it had been agreed to supply him with newspapers on certain terms. ]nsummning up ta,e Lord Chief Justice expressed himself in strong terms as to the facts to the jury, stating his opinion, and on this ground a new trial was moved for. Mr. Justice O:RE;'SWEI,L said he was of opinion that the summing up of the learned Judge, taken literally, was correct; but at the same time there were one or two passages in it which ciight have been misunderstood by the jury, though they vwould not mislead any person cognizant with the haw. Tbe jur might have supposed the learned Judge t ) have givean a direction in poinlt of law, instead of expressing strongly an opinion on the facts which a man of c.mmion aise -would unders,tand. There must therefore be a new trial -on the termns of the costs abiding the event. Rule aibsolute. The Lcmnn CHsE JusTcE aunounced that the Com-t would take the Special Paper on Weednesday as well as t -morrow-, and the Court wished it to be known.

Mr. WATSON, Q.C., was heard to show cause in this case. The further hearing was adjourned at the rising of the Court. (Sitti,igsu ntisi Prils, at 4estneindster before Mri: Justice WILLIAMS aUd a COmon JAr1y.) CURTIS V. eCAS\DLER. Er. Iiracnamara and l1r. Bennett appeared for the plaintiff, and TMr. Powvell for the defendant. This was an interpleader issue to try the right to certain goods seized under an execution at the suit of the defen-. dant, and claimed as being the property of the plaintiff, by virtue-of a dee,d of assignment executed three d.ays before the silre in lis favour, in trust for himself and certhin creditors of a mnan namedCollis. Mr. EMOwmELL, for the defence, maade an energetic appeal to the jury, in the course of which he contended that the assignment to the plaintiff was not a bond lfde transaction, and that it was executed for the purpose of defeating the I judgment obtained by the defendnant against Collis. The larned JUDGE having left the question of bonaaldes to the jary, They seturned a verdict for the defendant. The OaURT was occupied during the remainder of the day in trying-an action brought to recover the price of a horse bought at Rea's Repository, near the Elephant and Castle, on an alleged failure of consideration.

The juy found a verdict for the plaintiff for the sum of TUESDAY, ARIL 29. ISittiag in Banco, Easter Zern.) RE5IS V. usT. This case came before the Court on a demurrer to the declaration. The defendant was one of several persons made a defendant in a Chancery sait relating to an estate which the phintiff was employed to sell as an auctioneer. In the course of the proceedings the defendant made an affidavit before a comnnmssioner, imputing to the plaintiff among other things, misconduct in his business in another transaction. This, the plaintiff contended, was a libel, and in his declaration alleged that it was published without reasonable or probable cause, and alleging special damage in consequence. This declaration was demurred to. Mr. KEENSE appliod in support of the demurrer, and contended that the action would not lie. If the defendant, for the purpose of protecting himself, was obliged to swear an s1Bdavit, and stated anything which was unfounded and malicious, the proper course was to indict him for perjury. Mr. J. BRoiwx-, in support of the declaration, conteinded that the plaintiff had suffered a civil injury, for which an action would lie. The COURT were of opinion that there was no precedent for such an action, and that it would not lie. It was quite onsistent with the declaration that the defendant be.ieved what he stated to be true, and the Court could not be (alled upon to punish him in a civil action for swearing what he believed to be the truth in giving testimony in a (ourt of justice.

COURT OF EXCHEQUEP. , loxDAY, APRIL 28. (Sitting in Banco.) The Court took the Special Paper to-day, and disposed of several cases, the points in winch wvere of too technical a character to interest the general reader. (Sittings at Nisi Prius, before tUr.Baron MARTiN andl Con7- mZon Jtries.) V,N RAALTE V. ISAACS. This wvas an action for slander. The defendant pleaded the general issue. MIr. Prentice appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Gridliths for the defendant. It appeared from the plaintiff's case that he was a dealer in foreign3 fancy goods at 9S, 1fur.y-street, Ioxton. In August, 1855, he had seine dealings with iMr. Cornforthi, a manufactutrer at Eirmninghans, who, being satisfied with his references as to respectability, gave him credit' at different times;- in February, 1850, the balanceagainst him amounted tol149i. Inthe course of thatmonththedefendantwho was a traveller for a London firm, called on Cornforth, and, in answer to some inquiiries as to the character and solvency of plaintiff, said that "he was a man whom the Houndsditch people would not trust, as he was a man of no substance, a mere speculator and adventurer." In consequence of this statement Cornforth refused to give the plaintiff any further credit, on the ground that he had heard unfavourable reports of him. The plaintiff, having learnt that the information came from the defendant, had brought this action. At the close of the plaintiff's case. Mr. Baron MAwrix said, in I-is opinion, there was no evidence to go to the jury, as i! was evidently a privileged conmmunication on the part of the defendant. The plaintiff was then nonsuited.

ADMIRALTY COURT. TtrSnAT. APPIL 29. THE ALBATROS-flOT.tISTO. (Bcforc Dr. LusmNmToxf. Tlibs was a snit promoted by the brig Osprey, of the bur den of 274 tons, against the biig Albatros, of the bnden d 317 tons, to recover for a total loss arising from a collUjio between them at 2 p.m., on the 1-tth of -December last, off the Nash Isight, in the Bristol ChanneL The Os rey, coal laden, was proceeding from Cardiff to London; the Albatros, also coal laden, was bound, from Cardiff to lIaltA. The Osprey, close Ifanled on the starboard tac, desoried the Albatros, distant between two and three miles, broad on her lee bow, reaching to the northward, close hauled on the port tack. The Osprey expected that she would hear up, as it ws- alleged she ought to have done, but she continued her course until she was within nearly a cable's length, when she was loudly hailed, and the Osprey was kept *close-to the wind, clean full, bult the .batros continued her course, and ran stem on into the Osprey, in consequence of which she sank in ten minutes. On the part of the Albatros it was said she observed the OsDrey 300 fathoms distant on her lee bow, that the pilot incharge of her, beieving that he could not aely attempt to go to leeward of her by porting her heim, ordered it to be starboarded, and the head sheets to be let go, both which orders were -ninediately obeyed. The Osprey, however, continued her course, and ran into the Albatros. On behalf of the Osprey it was averred that the weather was fine and clear; whereas the Albatros asserted that it was occasionally thick and hazy. Dr. Bayford and Dr. D)eane appeared for the Osprey; Dr. Addanms and Dr. Twiss for the Albatros. The learned JuinGE, after consulting -with the Elder Brethren, by whom he was assisted, said they were of opinion that no blame whatever attached to the Osprey, but the accident arose solely from the fault of the pilot on board the Albatros. The Court would not decree costs on either side.-

Cowell and Rock, brewers. In this case the debts were only 481., and Messrs. Cowel were the principal creditors, for beer. The insolvent bad,a lease of his beershop, which was deposited with his brotherin-law for 121., which the opposing creditors were willing to pay as assignees, and to make the property available. There was some difficulty on the part of. the insolvent to give up possession. Messrs. Cowell paid the money to obtain thelease, and reqcuired possession. The CinF Co-mNasSsoNuZ held that the insolvent was bound to give up possession before he was discharged. AIl that an insolvent possessed belonged to his creditors, and Messrs. Cowell must be put into possession. A conditional discharge was pronounced on giving up possession. (Before 1r-. Commissioner P]mLars.) EN RE. CIIARLES OILE.

MIDDLESEX SESSIONS, Monday, April 28. The April adjourned quarter sessions commenced this morning at Clerkenawell, before M1r. PASHLEY, Q.C., as sistant-judge, and a benchl of magistrates. There were 3E prisoners for trial. The Ass1sTMvT-J4TDE briefly addressed the grand jury. Patricl; Clifford, 41, was indictedfor having stolen a Banr of E; ngland note for 1001., and two for 51. each, the property of David Clifford, in his dwelling-house. Mr. Payne appeared for the prosecution; 3r. Sleigh fo] the prisoner. The prosecutor said the prisoner was his brother. He va, a cooper, and lived at No. 4, Ellen-street, Commercial. road, and the prisoner had lodged with him, and was aware that he had 11I1. in Eank notes concealed under the mattress of his bed. On the 18th of March the prisoner assisted hirn in tuning over the mattress, to get a 51.-note ont ol the packet in which he had p laced them, and on the following day he absented himself without notice. On the 21st, not having thIen missed his money, he met the prisoner is Commercial-road, and asked him wvhat his " game" WaE in leaving so abrnptl, to which he replied that he was going to lve at Moorfields. The same nighl he missed the notes from under the mattress, and al once gave imforanation to the police. The next day the pri soner Nwas talken into custody, and he identified a 51.-nob which the prisoner had changed, and which -was produced The money was the result of " his hard earnings and hones dealings for 18 long years," and he had-withdrawn it fron l the savings-bank but a sholt time before, and kept it unde the mattress for safety. George Scott Christopher stated that he kept the S. Ceorge'sTap, in Chlurch-lane, WhitechapeL. On the Tnes day night before Good Friday the prisoner came thern about 10 o'clock, and had twro pots of beer anld some breac and cheese, and he tendered in payment a 51.-note (pro duced and identified;. He had besides a note for 1001. and another for 5E. Hie looked at themto see if theyswere genuine, and, finding they wvere, hc gave them hack to him, and told him to go, as he did not wish him to remain there vith so much money about him. Fearing he might get somewhere else and lose the lotb he retained the change of the note hehad given in paymentuntil the following morning, when he called and received it. lir. SLEIGh said it would be useless to contend against these facts; the ease was clearly proved. The jury returned a v,irdict of GeiEt1M. 1Ã¯Â¿Â½r. SLEIGH said it was a crael and unnatural robbery, and, as no trace of either the 1001.-note, or the other51.-note hadbeen discovered,he suggested thattheCourt should postpone the sentence, to give the prisoner an opportunity of giving information respecting them, if he thought proper. The AssIsTA?i-r-JuDGE assented, and the prisoner was accordingly remanded for judgment. Thomas Wilkins, 27, a ticket-of-leave convict, was indicted for stealing Slb. of beef, the property of Frederic7k Pitcher. M\r. MrEnteer-prosecnted; Mr. Payne defended. The facts were shortly these :-The prosecutor, a butcher, at 91, St. John-street, Clerkenwell, heard a strange noise in his shop one moroing, at an early hour, and on going dovn. without waiting to dress himself, he saw a piece of beef drawn through the railing over tho shop-door. He opened the door and saw the prisoner standing on auother man's back, with a stick, having a hook tied at the end of it, pulling meat off the hooks in the shop. One man ran one way, the other man darted off in a contrary direction ; but he pursued the prisoner, who had the beef, just as he was, having nothing on but his shirt; he saw him drop the beef, and chased him until he was stopped by a constable in Compton-street, having kept him in sight all the time. The defence was an alibi, but it failed; and The jury found the prisoner Guilty. It was then proved that in 1852 he was sentenced to seven years? transportation, and that he was liberated on a ticket of leave in Oetober last. It was suggested that the prisoner had been endeavonring I to earn an honest livelihood since his discharge, but that the police had given information that he was a returned convict oo his employer, a coffeehouse-kieeper, in Old-street, in conseq,uence of which he lost his situation. this was utterly denied by Inspector Brennan. The AcsIsTA?BT-JUrDGE said there was nothing which required denying in the statement made, because it was not proved, and was not relevant to the question whether the prisoner lhed been previously convicted. The jury found that the prisoner was the person whose c onviction had been put, in. The Assrsnaier-JunoE sentenced him to four years' penal servitude, and said that sentence -would not, like the ola sentence of transportation, be reduced, perhaps, by half, or two-thirds, but woiuld be strictly carried out to the last day of the term. Charles Clark, a well-dressedman, pleaded"Guilty"to a charge of larceny in a dwelling-house. The prisoner used to go about to houses where lodgings wereto be let, and by some pretence contrived to he left alone in the reom he was taken into, when he pocketed any little-article he could lay hands upon. Upwardsof 5 addresses and a variety of keys were found upon him. It wvas said that he -as so respectably connected that his friends would not come forward to ga keon his behalf, although he had hitherto breago Senencd t 12monhs'imprisonment. TUE1SDKY, tAm 29 (Beforc Mr. PASmEEY, Q.C'., A[SSis'ant.Udgye, at Clerlcen- Stephen Bristow, a little boy, said to hell1 years of age, hut looking much younger, and MWary Perkins, 56, w-ere severally indicted-Bristow for stealin a brass nozzle and pipe,a nd Per-kins for feloniously receilving the same, well knowring it to have been stolen. Bristow pleaded " Guilty" to the charge of *tealing, but Perkins "An ot Guilty" as to receiving. Mr. Platt prosecuted * Mfr. Horry defended Perkins. William Bristow said, lie was employed and lived on the premlises of 31essrs. Harmar and Pearson, distillers, of '.hteeross-steet, St. Luke's, and the male prisoner was his son, and lived there wsith him. The nozile and pipe produced, composed of brass and copper, wvas the property of his employers, and was worth os. It wras missed from one of the nosebags in the yard on Monday week. Saralh Bristow, mother of the prisoner Bristow, said, on M onday week; she missed a nozzle from one of the waggons, having seen It there a short time before. Her son absented himself from Mfonday until the - following Wednesday, and -when he came home she questioned him- as to what he had done wi2th the nozzle, arid he said that lhe had sold it in White Horse-court for lAd. He went with her and pointed out the femaleptisoner'shouse astheplacewlierehehad sold it. Witness entered the shop alone, and askred Mrs. Perkmusif she had purchased such an article as she describoed of ai little boy, and she denied thsat she ever purchased such 1 thing of cbildiren. As she repeated her denial of having bought any such article, writness went out and broug,ht, backE her sn, whom she confronted with the female prisoner,when the latter d-nsitted thst she had bought such a thing~ o f a boy, hut had put it aw,ay foriear it should beiqi or. She then2 went into a room at the bsack of her rag aAnd bone shop, and produiced the nozzle, Witness paid 1ld., acid brought the artice awy. Edward Dillon, police-constable, G 98, sAAid, he tookj Bristow into custody, and on going to the station-house he said he sold the article for 1I-d. The fenale prisoner went to the station-hoase, where she admitted having purchased the nozzle of the boy for 12d. The boy in her heg said she had told him if he said anything about her buying this she would not buy anything else of -him, which she denied. 3fr. Horry addressed the jury for the prisoner, and attempted toinduce them to believe that she-had no ielonious intention, and most readily gave up the lost article when it was inquired for. The 3ury immediately found her Guilty.t Inspector Brennan said, hehad known the woman for the la6t 2 or 30 years,sana on his evidence she had been wice convicted by the Commissioners of Excise for illidt distillation. Her hasband had recently come out of prison, lsaving served six months for receiving stolen property, and hehad lso been indicted for inciting boys to rob their masters. These marine-storesho?j, andother places nmown as " leaving shops," gave the police the greatest difficulty in tracing stolen property. The father o Bristow was called by the Assistant-Judge, and, in answer to questions, said his son was , very bad and dissolute boy, and acquainted with very bad companions. If he sent him to school he ran away, and he could do no good with him. The ASSISTANT-JuDGE sentenced Bristow to imprisonment and bard labour for two years, and Perkins to imn prisonment for 16 months, with an intimation that any future offence on her part would be punished with panal servitude for along period. William Coombes, 23, tsilor, was indicted for having assaulted and beaten John Smith and James Neville, coal. stables of the metropolitan police district, in the executiox of their duty. It appeared that on the evening of the 20th inst. tho defendant was creating a disturbance in Whiteeross-street, when Smith, 79 G., interposed, and advised himn to go quietly home. He struck the constable on the head a violentblow with a thick stick-, andbithimseverely about tho hands. Keville, 152 G, went to his assistance, when the prisoner dealt himn a blow on the back part of the head with the same stick, which rendered him insensible and inflicted such injury that the constable had since been unable to resume duty, and, in the opinion of Mr. Mather, th'e divisional surgeon, it was most likely the injury he sustained would be of a permanent nature. The prisoner said he was intoxicated at the time and knew nothing of the matter ; however, it was his first offence and he would takie care it should be the last. The jury found the prisoner Guilty. The ASSISTANT-JUDGE said, it was a very savage and brutal assault, and sentenced the prisoner to 12months' hard labour. lMÃ¯Â¿Â½r. CRrxSY presided in the Second Court, and tried A- number of cases of larceny.
POLICE. Bow-STRErT.-lMr. HR&RY WAS occupied during tilrgreater part of the afternoon indisposing of cases arising out. of the occurrences of yesterday in connexion with the proclanaation of peace. One of the prisoners, Samuel Horner, was charged wilth stealing a gold watch from Mr. J. IL Hare, a clerk in the War Department. A police-constable, in private clothes saw the prisoner deliberately unbutton the prosecutor's coat and help himself to the watch with which he bolted through the crowd. The officer folowe in pursuit, and, I although nearly a quarter of an hour elapsed before he could' reach the pnisoner, owing to the crowded state of the thoroughfares, he never once lost sight of the man, but ap. prehended him before he could get lid of the stolen property. The prisoner, preferring to be dealt with summarily, -was committed to four months' hard labour. William Brawley was charged with stealing a gold watch from a lady named Wordswick, of Norwich. In this case the prisoner had assumed the functions, apparently, of a detective officer, and, while pretending to direct the prosecutrix and her daughter through the crowd, contrived to snatch the watch from her pocket and transferit to his own. The act was noticed by the daughter and by two constables on duty, and the prisoner was speedilytaken into custody with the watch in his possession; but hemade an unsuccessful attempt to dispose of itby dropping it into a baker's basket after he was apprehended. The prisoner pleaded guilty and was sentenced to sir months' imprisonment. The prisoners, in several other cases, were remanded for further exauination. AYNExsEBo,sE.-A foreigner, who gave Iuis name Precihle' was charged with stationing himself at the door of the mansion of the Austrian ambassador, and threatening to break the windowvs if not provided with the means of getting back to his own country-Italy. He had a large stone in his hand when taken into custody by King, 76 D. It was further shown that he had more than once been relieved. In default of bail for his keeping the peace he -was sent to prison for a month. W.ISTLNSTER.-Hemry Mitchell, alias James Lee, a felow of repulsive appearance, was on Monday charged. with obtaining 1U. 10s. from the Earl of Orkney under falsepretences. His Lordship stated, onaboutthe 4th or 5th inst. prisonercame to his residence, No. 3, Ennismore-place, Princes-gate, Eyde Park;, and solicited pecu niary aid. He wa-s attired as. corporal in the Sappers and Miners, and represented that he ha2 just returned from the Crimea, where he had been * severely wounded, and having received his discharge was anxious to get to his native place, G(locester. shlire. He added that he had been accompanied to London by a private in his Lordship's eldesb.. son's regiment, who had ltst aleg, and that the sUm required to take his companion and himself home was 1Z. 10s. In the course of conversation the prisoner stated that he knew all three of his Lordship's sons, who were in. the Crimea, and produced a regularly drawn up dischargefrom the Sappers and Miners in support of his assertion that he had belonged to that corps, and stated that hle had a pension for his services. As he wore the uniform of the reg,iment, with two stripes of merit on his arn, this coupled w%ith the other circumstances, induced hlis Lordship to believe his statementand to givehiintherequiredamount Subsequeutly, however, his Lordship suspected that the. prisoner was an impostor, and he ascertained the fact.. Having met the prisoner accidentaDly near Piccadilly on; Saturday, he gave him into custody. MIr. A RSOtn intimated that it was necessary the fullest inquiries should be made into the matter, with a view of: ascertaining the prisoner's antecedents, and remandcd him till Thursday. CLERKENWELL.-The court was crowdedl to oxcess on Monday by the victins of the gang of American hotel pltnderers, who have for some time been carrying on their practices at the principal hotels throughout the united kingdom and at Paris. The prissoner, Benjamin Allen Howard (an account of whose previous examination has already apoeared in this journal), and Oscar Kingston, who was brought u1p on a ,vrit of habasn corpus from Mlanchester, -were charged with having, on the night of the 18th of March, stolen from X bedroom at the Great Northern Hotel, King's-cross, about 560!. in notes, the property of N.* Staniland, a solicitor of Boston, Lincolabhire. Both prisoners are smart-looking Yankees, and had wyith them a quantity of valuable jewelry. The evidence taken on a former occasion having been read over, Mr. Staniland stated, that the last time he saw his purse was at Boston. There were other people in the train with hini. He would not undertake to swear whether he lost his purse in London or in Lincolnshire. He advertised his loss, and then he stated that he was not sure where be had lost the notes. Several other witnesses were called in support of the case. after which the prisoner was remanded. TsAcS.-" J. C." has forwarded Jos. for the benefit of the Police-constable Chapman, who was permanently dis-- abled by a ticket-of-leave convict named Michael Hogan.. An acknowledgment in Tl e Times was requested. L._BnETir.-John Brown and John Edward Stephens, expert housebreakers, and well-known to the police, werefinally examined before Mr. ELLio-r, on a charge of entering the dwellinghouse of Mr, Stevens, 17, St. ary-he- - Strand-place, HatchamnRpark. On Sunday week the prosecutor gave his servant X. bolyday, and left home with Mrs. Stevens aboutt 1 o'clockto spen,d the afternoon with a friend. Before leaving, Mrs. Stevens observed the prisoners standing opposite the nextdoor, sO that they must have seen them go out and close thedoor after them. At fewr minutes after they were gone the. prisoner Brown was observed by an opposite neighbour togo and knock at the door two or three -times, and then let himself and his companion in -with a skeleton key, an(I close the door after them. An alarm was given, and the house having been surrounded by several of the neighbours, tihe prisoners, finding that they had been discovered, rushed into the street, but were soon seized. When taken, the prsoner Brown exclaiRied, " It's an unfortunate morning's ork. I vould not have it happen for 201., and I hope oy friend will not betaken." His friend, however, after giving his pursuers a lengthened chase, was secured, and on tbo house of the prosecutor being examined the whole of the drawers -were found to be forced open and their contents strewn about the place. Housebreaking imnplements -were also found, and on the person of Browvn a hunch of skeleton Evidence was also given of the prisoners having been before summarily convicted for housebreaking, and of the last conviction against Stephens, wbich was that of three months, for being found in the Queen's Prison under suspicious cireutustances, with housebreaking implements iii his possession.

IRELAND. ARCIBISHIOP OIM ON THEPECE. (OmoM oUR oWZ CORspoNKMT.) IYUBLl2, MONDAY MOLN-WG. 'The following is a portion of a pastoral by the Gost Rev. Dr. Cullen, which was read yesterday from the altars of all the chapels in the city of] Dublin 4sGod in1 His mercy has listened to the prayers of the faithbful incessantly offered uip to Him during the last years for the restoration of peace. The war which lately raged Witlh so muclh fury, laying waste so many fair provinces and cities, andfilling the vorld with widowvs and orphaus-the war -which was the occasion of so many evils to suffering humaniity, is now at aii end, add peace has been proclaimed. In order to niialfest our feelings of gratitude to God for the happy termination of war, and for the re-establishment of plcace, a solemn !7e Dein se will be snmg in our mnetropolitan cl,urch of the Inmnaculate Conception immediately after l,igh2mass,0on nextSunday, April 27, and benediction will he given with the most holy Sacrament. A Te Deunu will also he snug or recited in all the other churches ,f the diocess on the same Sunday or on Ascension Thursday; and in every mass to be celebr_ted on the three Rogation Days the collect, Pro Gratiar-nin Action;, Will be inserted inimediately after the prayers of the day. On those days of prayer, let us al unite, dearly beloved brethren, with the miinister of the church in manifesting our heartfelt gratitude to the Almighty Giver of all goodgiftsforlHis}favoursandmercies. And it is not nmerely for the termnination of a dreadful aau destructive w. ar that we are to he g,rateful to God; it behoves us also on E O soleumn anl occasion to ad7uire the wonderful ways of His yrovidence, which reacheth from end to end mightily and ordereth al tlhings sweetly, and to thank Him for having drawn good from the evils occasioned by hman passion and ordained that all things should work together unto goo to those who love hhn, the children of His church. The late war,indeed, has shed renewed lustreon ourholy religion,and given our church fresh claims on the affection and adiniration of thle world. In the midst of the din of anns and universal strife her rights have been recognized and proclaimed in extensive and powerful kingdoms and she has bcen restored to the exercise of that freedoin to which her Diviue origin gives her a full claim. Even in the countries where she was lately persecuted in the most cruel manner a newrera appers to have dawned, aud we may expect that our brethren in the regions of the East and North will soon be able to enjoy the protection of just lawvs and to profess their religion without fear of molestation; And have not onr brave Catholic countrymen and our powerful Catholic alles showbn that the religion, they professed, the faith 'which was dearer to them than their lives, tends to promote discipline, obedience, patience, and resignation, and to inspire the soldier with courage, and to prepare him to sacrifice his life for his country's good? How imany brave Catholcs have illustrated those principles by their daring actions in the distant regions of the East, and, alas! how many of them, in their career of glory, have shedtheir blood -how many have been consigned to a lonely grave on the inhospitable shores of the Crimuea ! Let, thoen, the bigots be silent who pretend that the Catholic religion is hostile to the development of the human mind or to the exercise of the most exalted virtues. And w hat shall we say of the Catholic chaplains that accompanied the allied armies? Their zeal a nd devotedness, their courage andsacrifices, have merited universal praise. Many of them have laid down their lives in the service of their brethren, thus giving a most perfect proof of the charity which burnt within them. And can wov pass in silence those devoted spouses of Jesis Christ, the Sisters of Mercy and Charity? With unexampled heroism and devotedness, leaving theirsolitude they determined to encounter all the dangers of contagion of pestilential climnates, and of -var, in order to afford relief and consolation to the dying soldier. Their labours, their sufferings, their charity, and zeal must excite the admiration of every true Christian." The peace question being thus disposed of Dr. Cullen proceeds to discuss domestic broils, commencing with the recent attack upon the Romish church:- " Peace is not yet solemnly ratified, and yet the bigotry and intolerance of a violent party, vhich scarcely showed Ihemselves in the time of wvar, have already conimenced fierce attacks unon the Catholic church, and have doomed to destruction, as far as in them lies, the orly public Catholic institution which receives aid in this country from Government. The hundreds of milliols paid by the Cathalic opllation of Ireland to the Protestant establishnment-the ource of so many evils in this country-are forgotten; but it is declared to be an intolerable grievance that a small subsidy should be granted for Catholic education. Has t not also been announced that attempts will soon be made to render the public system of education mnore hostile to our religion and to convert national schools into nurseries of proselytism? And is it not asserted that plans will be devised to turn away the private endowments of Catholic schools from their original purposes, and to introduce into them a mixed system, dangerous to the faith and morals of children? We repeat, dearly beloved brethren, that such trials may be expected. We arc to he prepared to mleet themu with a spirit of Christians fortitude, ready to make every sacrifice rather than allow the education of the little ones of Jesus Christ to be tampered with, or expose their faith to danger." The remainder of the pastoral is ahnost wholly dlevoted to a condemnation of the Protestant proselytizers-a favourite themue of Dr. Culllen a;nd his brother prelates. PRoOCLArfATIO? Or PEACE . NText Friday, it is said, is fixed for the public announcement, in Dublin, of the ratification of the peace, The streets are to be lined by thie military, to the number of some 7,000 men, The several public builidings in the city will be illuminlated in the evening, and a brillianst display of firewvorks will be presenlted ini the Plicenix Park. MiORAL roRCon PA!flUOTS. The Lzmwe;-ck Obserer,x a new aspirant to public favour, contains the following parag,raph*. " The pistols which O'Connell used on the occasion of his celebrated duel with D'Esterre, in days when duelling was a practice which the lawrs of society enforced upon genltlemuen under the penalty of loss of caste and honour, wrere sold by auction in this city last Thursday, by Mr. Coleman, at his auction mart, to Mr. Gleesor; P.L.Gr., for 27s. the pair. Thnis case of pistols was purchased previously at the Calmerconl auction oy a person p resent, and wrere sulbsequently p) awne d in Limneerick." e THlE FRENCH SHIS OF ARAT IYSTOWN. The presence inKingstown harbour of the French frigate Artemise, 32 guns, Captain Barlatier de M\Iar, and the brig agile, 12 guns, Captain Pottier, attracted a large number of persons to Kingston yesterday. The Artemise is a ship of about 1,600 tons, pierced for 32 24-pounders and other heavier guns, and carrying 250 men. Her hull is somewvhat heavy-looking, but in eyery other respect she has that taut appearance by which ships of war are distingtished frno merchant craft. On going on board the visitor finds the style and arrangement of the upper and the gimdeckis, the armament, r o., to resemble those of an English man of--ar so much that but for the tricolour lnwhich floated from the nmizen peak-, and also the dress of the sailorsX he would almost suppose the vesseI to belong to the navy of his own country. One of the officers of the prtenise was at the siege of Sebastopol,- and is decorated with the cross of the Legion of Honour. The Agile is a pretty craft of about 500 tons b,uden, and has 120 men on board. Both are sailing vessels. They started from Cherbourg, and are destinned for Iceland; nhere they wrill remain at a French fishing station. On their wvay they wrill touchat Glasgow. The French ships will remain at Kingstown until Wednesday or Thursday. TIIE xIPSU OF xWRuA NS. The returns of the Irish banks of issue for-the four wveeks ending the 12th of April showv, as they almost invariably do at this period of the year, a falling off in the circulation. As compared with the March returns there is a contraction of 110,7711 This is not a much larger deficiency than is usuNal in this particular month, but the limitation in the issues set in this year at an earlier period than they usually do, and amount on the quarter to no less a Sulm than half a million. Last year there was a falling off on the month of 195,0007., and on the three months of 2ge0,00.t In 1854 there was a decrease on the month of a0,0001., but an increase on the quarter of 100,000rl; and in 1853 there aes a decrease on the month of 5,0001., and an incereasen on the quarter of 17s,000h . In the coin held there is a decrease on the month of 90,4481. The contraction in the circulation extends to every one of the banks, with the single exception of the Clonmel branch of the National. The Bank of Ireland have added to the amount of co in their cofers All the other banks have a smaller sum on hand than they had in March. To show the positioni of the banks in the aggregate now- and at the same period of the last four years the followinreturns from the Gazette are subjoined:- PourWeelis ending. Average Circulation. Average Coin Held. April 17, 185 . 4,55o52,858 ..

DUBIAN, TuxsDAnY LorsNqG. THE TIPPERARY BA.NR. Yesterdayhaving b-eei appointed for a meeting lo deecie upon the amended list of contributories to ihe Tipperary Bank, the proceedings took piace in the Nid -Prius Couirt, the Master's-office not aflbrding sufiicient accommodation for the formnidable array of counsel, agents, o., ready and prepared to do batle for their respective clients. MIr. Brewster, Q.C, appeared for Mr. Vincent Scully; Mr. M'Farlane for Mr. Wilson Kennedy; Mr. Fitzgibbon, Q. C., for 53 English shaeholders; and Sir Cohmnan OÃ¯Â¿Â½bnghlin C., for Mr. ibgert Keitinge, 1. P. The official xmanager, -who was present upon the occasion, was representecd by Mr. ArDonough, Q.C., and M1r. Lawless. It is quite lncessry to encumber your columns with even an outline of all the speeches and learned arguiments which sprtead over some four or five columns of the morning papers, and' which in the end left, the whole caSse in pretty much the same state as it stood previously to this legal field-day. -the actual -amount of business done is thus accurately'sunmred up by the Freecnan?s Journal. The further hearing of the ease was specially fixed for Monday, the 12th of May- " One Queen's coumisel represented no less than 53 rep"diating English shareholders. These 53 shareholders would seem to repudiiate in globo, and the Court was gravely informed that 53 affidavits were on their journey to nd, sworn to, of course, by these repudiators, ind, according to counsel, showing sufficient reasons why they should not be asked to pay up. One ofthesepartiesappearsto be a lady,who was presented with 400 shares in the concern-for, being 'a governess,' she can hardly be supposed' to have been a purchaser. The cases, however, whichelecited most interest were those of Mr. Vincent Scully, Mr. Wilson Kennedy, Mr. Frank Scully, Mfr. James Scully, and Mr. Keatirg, MP. These parties allobjected tobein retained onthe list in the positions in which they were placed by the offic:al manager. l'he variety of the g=rounds put forward is curious, and notuninstrUCtive. Mr.Vincent ScuUlyobjectsto be named as a contributory primarily liable, having parted with his shares to John Sadleir in ApriL 1855, stating that he did so, not because he anticipated the crash, but because he had no confidence in the management. MIr. ScuUy shows that there was no audlt-no examination into the eff9irs of the bank-that he hiniself, asone of the directors, knew nothing of the concern, and that he retired solely because he was not wiling to occupy such a position.. Master Murphy postponed his judgment as to' whether Mr. Scully should be heldtobe liableintihe firstorinthesecondinstance; bnt, aswai admitted by hiis counsel, it is of little pecuniary importance to Mr. Scully whether he be made liable as a primary or secondary contributor. " Mr. WVilson Kennedy took the same objection as.mr. Scully, but, in addition, objected to be made liable until it was first shown that debts were contracted since April, 1855, the date of the transfer of his shares. This point is one that wiUl give rise to mulch litigation, and wiU, doubtless, be relied on by all those on the list as shareholders who trans-' ferred withiu three years. This point will include the onesided alterations attempted to be made in deposit-notes without the concurring judgment of the depositors; but, as the question was not fully opened, we need not dwell On it to-day. "Mr. James Scully and Mr. Francis ScuUy want to he placed On the list as representatives of their father, but, though the object is plain, the precise ef'ect of such an addition On their liability is not so clear. They will doubtless contend, should they succeed in t-his, that the property not inherited from the same source ought not to be held responsible. "MWr. Kleating takes new ground. IHe claims to -be merely the representative of John Sadleir in the matter, and to have held all the shares standing in his name as trustee of MIr. Sadleir. "The Master in all these cases postponed his decision, and in some postponed the hearing. The list, then, stands to-day as it was originally made out by the muaager, and, save the maling of flash speeches and the expenditure of some money on both sides, the proceedings of yesterday have advanced the case verylittle, if at all, tow;ards a final settlemuent; and have only added to the*general disgust felt at the whole management of the Tipperary Bankc, its mnoneys, its transfers, its reports, and its dividends."' r.EGAL, APrOINTIMENS. - The valuable office of Deputy Keeper of the Rolls, vacant by the resignation of Mr. Robert Wogan, has been conferred on 3Mr. John Reilly, son-in-law of Liord St. Leonard's, and Secretary to the Master of the Rolls.
